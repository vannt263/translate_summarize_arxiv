    "dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are semiconductors , in which transition or rare - earth metal atoms randomly replace a fraction of atoms in one sublattice . transition metal ( tm ) impurities , due to their high abundance and diffusivity , can easily enter the host semiconductor . in the group iv elemental semiconductors , they occupy mainly interstitial positions , whereas in iii - v semiconductors the 3d tm impurities usually substitute group iii atoms .",
    "the metastability of the zinc blende phase of the dms ( iii , mn)v compounds and low solubility of manganese in these materials were the major obstacles for a synthesis of dilute magnetic semiconductors.@xcite however , the idea to combine in dms the charge degrees of freedom of hole or electron carriers with the spin degrees of freedom of magnetic impurities became reality after a new doping technique based on non - equilibrium low temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( lt - mbe)@xcite was developed .",
    "the discovery@xcite of ferromagnetic ordering in manganese doped inas with the @xmath5k curie temperature fuelled dms studies that resulted in fabrication of ( ga , mn)as compounds with @xmath6k @xcite or even @xmath7k.@xcite more recently@xcite curie temperatures exceeding 150k were reported in ( ga , mn)as .",
    "an above room temperature ferromagnetism was announced@xcite also in gan and _ p_-type gap doped with mn .",
    "advanced iii - v growth technique such as metal organic vapor phase epitaxy ( movpe ) , or metal organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) together with lt - mbe can produce good quality dms with various element combinations .",
    "a unique coexistence of high - temperature magnetism and semiconductor properties opens new venues of fundamental studies and applications of dms s .",
    "the dms s may be quite promising in spintronics , information technology,@xcite quantum computing,@xcite in manipulation of magnetism by an electric field@xcite and/or by illumination,@xcite in devices governed by the giant magnetoresistance effect,@xcite where the interlayer tunneling resistance is changed under the action of a magnetic field . among the variety of applications",
    "one can not exclude other functionalities such as nanostructure aspect of dms : @xcite the dms based quantum wells are expected to have unusual ferromagnetic properties with @xmath4 ( as shown in field effect transistors@xcite ) and high coercitivities@xcite tunable electrically , rather than magnetically.@xcite    although ferromagnetic order in ( ga , mn)as has been observed for the first time as early as@xcite 1996 with @xmath8k , its microscopic origin from the theoretical point of view still remains not well understood .",
    "extrapolating from ( ga , mn)as , fm ordering with high @xmath4 was predicted for @xmath9-type ( ga , mn)n @xcite and found in ref . .",
    "however , a direct extrapolation of the trends known for the gaas - based material characterized by a relatively narrow forbidden energy gap to the wide gap gan dms is not well founded .",
    "the differences in formation of the ferromagnetic order arise from the differences in the structure of chemical bonds between the mn impurity and valence electrons in various iii - v host semiconductors .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to pinpoint these differences and to construct a general microscopic theory of the double exchange ( superexchange ) in dilute magnetic semiconductors .",
    "there are three approaches , which one may follow to study magnetic states of dms s .",
    "according to the first approach , one chooses an effective spin hamiltonian and calculates the corresponding exchange coupling constant in the course of this derivation . the major part of the available descriptions of the fm order in such dms s as ( ga , mn)as , ( ga , mn)p and ( ga , mn)n",
    ", are based on semi - phenomenological models , which postulate the existence of local magnetic moments on the mn sites , as well as an indirect exchange between these moments and the electrons in the valence band of the host semiconductor.@xcite some of these theories emphasize the role of shallow acceptor levels existing in the first two of these systems @xcite or of resonance levels.@xcite    the second approach is based on an extended cluster method , where a cubic supercell with a magnetic mn ion in its center is used to calculate the density of spin polarized states of a `` homogeneously doped '' crystal ( see e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "the resulting picture provides information about positions and occupation of mn - related majority and minority `` bands '' .",
    "sometimes an effective @xmath10 exchange hamiltonian is introduced phenomenologically in this picture , and the effective exchange constant is chosen to fit the numerical data ( see ref . and the first paper in ref . ) .    according to the third approach",
    ", realistic exchange parameters should be derived within the framework of a microscopic theory based on the knowledge of the electronic structure of iii - v semiconductors doped with tm impurities .",
    "an exhaustive microscopic theory for isolated tm impurities in semiconductors was constructed more than two decades ago starting with the papers of refs .",
    "( see monograph ref . for a detailed description and ref . where a powerful numeric approach was developed ) .",
    "this theory contains all necessary ingredients for an accurate derivation of the indirect magnetic exchange between interacting impurities .",
    "our first attempt@xcite to apply this theory to ( ga , mn)as resulted in a quantitative description of the hole concentration dependent curie temperature @xmath4 in _ p_-type dms s within the framework of a very simple model hamiltonian , in which the effective _ kinematic exchange _ results from hopping between the occupied @xmath11-states of the half - filled @xmath11-shell of the mn impurity via empty heavy hole ( _ hh _ ) states near the top of the valence band .    here",
    "we present a general theory of the double exchange interaction in mn - doped iii - v semiconductors , which covers both @xmath9- and @xmath12-type materials .",
    "the theory establishes differences between the exchange mechanisms in these two cases and demonstrates that the conventional zener double exchange mechanism @xcite is realized only in @xmath12-type dms ( presumably , in ( ga , mn)n ) .",
    "it is well known that the tm ions may introduce impurity levels in the forbidden energy gap . among them",
    "the manganese impurity in gaas and some other semiconductors exhibit peculiar features . according to its position in the series of the tm elements , a neutral impurity mn@xmath13 in the ga - site",
    "is expected to have the @xmath14 configuration .",
    "however , the mn ion retains its fifth electron in its @xmath15 shell , because of an exceptional stability of the high - spin half - filled @xmath16 state resulting from the strong intra - atomic hund interaction .",
    "the manganese impurities not only introduce magnetic moments in the _ p_-type ( iii , mn)v compounds but also create potentials attracting holes , i.e. act as acceptors .",
    "therefore , the neutral substitution impurity state is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 stands for the loosely bound hole , and the manganese provides both holes and magnetic moments to the host , @xmath19 is the spectroscopic notation indicating the irreducible representation describing this state ( more about these notations can be found , e.g. in ref . )",
    "existence of the complex mn @xmath20 in lightly doped bulk gaas is detected by electron spin resonance measurements @xcite and by infrared spectroscopy.@xcite these studies discovered an acceptor level inside the energy gap around 110 mev above the top of the valence band .",
    "this value is substantially higher than 30 mev resulting from conventional effective mass theory,@xcite which already implies that treatment of the manganese impurities in iii - v compounds requires a more refined approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of negatively ionized complexes @xmath21 is detected in ( ga , mn)as epilayers grown by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy,@xcite which indicates that both mobile and localized holes exist in ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as . the coexistence of weakly and strongly localized states is also in accordance with _",
    "ac _ conductivity experiments . @xcite    apparently , a similar impurity electronic structure is realized in ( ga , mn)p .",
    "but in contrast , mn in the wide gap gan semiconductor releases one of its @xmath11-electrons to the valence band , which is typical of all other tm impurities , and remains in the mn@xmath22 state , unless the sample is deliberately @xmath12-doped .",
    "the latter state is neutral , so there is no need in binding a hole to maintain the neutrality of the ground state .",
    "this leaves no room for a direct extrapolation from ( ga , mn)as to ( ga , mn)n , and the kinematic inter - impurity exchange mechanisms in these two systems should be considered separately .    in this paper",
    "we will develop a general theory of ferromagnetic exchange in dms s .",
    "it turns out that the zener mechanism @xcite in its classical form is realized in @xmath12-type ( ga , mn)n , whereas the @xmath9-type systems ( ga , mn)as , ( ga , mn)p and , possibly , @xmath9-(ga , mn)n are examples of another type of indirect ( kinematic ) exchange interaction , which was not observed in the family of mn oxides described by the zener theory of ferromagnetic insulators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents a detailed description of the microscopic model including the calculation of the exchange interaction between tm impurities .",
    "since this calculation appears to be rather involved , its mathematical details are given in the appendix . in section iii",
    "we apply the results obtained in section ii to _ p_-type semiconductors , find the kinematic exchange interaction and using the molecular field approximation calculate the curie temperature as a function of the mn content and hole concentration for _ p_-type ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)p . the results are compared with available experimental data . the @xmath12-type ( ga , mn)n dms s , which possesses specific features differing it from other dms s , is discussed in section iv .",
    "finally , the scope of the theory and comparison with other approaches are summarized in the concluding section v.",
    "according to the general principles of the theory of isolated tm in semiconductors,@xcite the electronic spectrum of these impurities in iii - v semiconductors is predetermined by the structure of chemical bonds ( hybridization ) between the @xmath15-orbitals of impurity ions and the @xmath9-orbitals of the valence band electrons , whereas their magnetic state is governed by the coulomb and exchange interactions within the @xmath15-atomic shell ( intra - atomic electron - electron correlations ) , modified by hybridization with the electron states of the crystalline environment .",
    "the localized tm impurity @xmath11-states possess @xmath23 and @xmath24 symmetry of the crystal point symmetry group @xmath25 as revealed in the theoretical studies of electronic properties of isolated tm impurities in semiconductors carried out in the 70 s and 80 s ( see , e.g. refs . ) .",
    "the @xmath24 states are practically nonbonding @xmath11-states of the impurity 3@xmath11 shell , whereas the @xmath23 states form bonding and antibonding configurations with the @xmath9-states of the valence band .",
    "the two latter types of states are classified as the crystal field resonances ( cfr ) , in which the @xmath11-component dominates , and the dangling bond hybrids ( dbh ) with predominantly @xmath9-type contribution of the valence band states .",
    "crucially important is that the absolute positions of cfr levels relatively weakly depend on the band structure of the host semiconductor material .",
    "the cfr levels are pinned mainly to the vacuum energy , and this pinning is modulated by the counterbalanced interactions with valence and conduction band states.@xcite the dbh states are more intimately connected with the peak in the density of states of the heavy hole band , which dominates the _ pd_-hybridization .",
    "the variety of electronic and magnetic properties of mn and other tm ions in different iii - v host semiconductors stems from these universal chemical trends .    due to a large mismatch between positions of the valence bands in gaas , gap on the one side and in gan on the other side",
    ", the mn(@xmath26 ) cfr level falls deep in the valence band in gaas , gap and appears within the forbidden energy gap of gan .",
    "the cfr nature of mn @xmath27 @xmath23-level near the middle of the gap for ( ga , mn)n is confirmed experimentally@xcite and follows also from numerical calculations.@xcite this @xmath23-level is _ empty _ in the neutral state mn@xmath22 of the substitution impurity .",
    "it becomes magnetically active only in @xmath12 doped materials , e.g. in ( ga , mn)n , where part of the mn impurities capture donor electrons and transform into charged ions mn@xmath28 .",
    "a similar behavior is characteristic of all other light tm ions in all iii - v compounds including gaas and gap.@xcite    since the position of the valence band in gaas and gap is substantially higher in the absolute energy scale ( with the vacuum energy as the reference point ) than those in gan , the cfr @xmath23 level ( @xmath29 ) in the ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)p dms s falls below the center of gravity of the valence band .",
    "therefore , this cfr level is always occupied , mn ions retain their fifth electron in the @xmath15-shell , and the neutral substitution impurity state is ( @xmath30 ) , where @xmath18 stands for a loosely bound hole occupying the relatively shallow acceptor level in the forbidden energy gap of gaas and gap semiconductors .    both of the above mentioned situations may be described within the resonance scattering model of the tm impurity states in semiconductors based on the anderson single impurity hamiltonian , proposed originally for tm impurities in metals,@xcite and later modified for semiconductors in refs . .",
    "an extension of the anderson model to two tm impurities in metals was proposed in ref . resulting in a ferromagnetic coupling in tm doped metals . using this model ref derived an interaction similar to the rkky interaction . here",
    "we discuss a model describing interaction between mn ( and other tm ) impurities in a semiconductor host . in accordance with hund rule for the electron occupation in mn ions in a tetrahedral environment ,",
    "@xcite two competing states mn(d@xmath31 ) and mn ( d@xmath32 ) , involved in the double exchange in dms , have the @xmath33 and @xmath34 configurations , respectively .",
    "the next charged state @xmath35 has a much higher energy due to the strong intra - ionic coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , the passive nonbonding @xmath24-electrons may be excluded from our consideration .",
    "the indirect exchange between magnetic moments is mediated by virtual transitions of @xmath23 electrons into unoccupied valence band states .",
    "the hamiltonian for two tm impurities in a iii - v semiconductor has the form : @xmath36 where the band hamiltonian @xmath37 includes only the heavy hole band . here",
    "@xmath38 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a hole with momentum @xmath39 and spin orientation @xmath40 in the _ hh _ band of the semiconductor with the energy dispersion @xmath41 .",
    "the heavy hole band gives the dominant contribution to the formation of the impurity states,@xcite and governs the onset of ferromagnetic order .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ and1 ] ) describes the electrons within the mn atoms with a possible account of the crystal field of the surrounding atoms . in principle",
    ", we have to write down a multielectron hamiltonian describing the degenerate states of the @xmath11 shell , and including coulomb and exchange interactions .",
    "however , as we show below it is usually sufficient to consider the non - degenerate version of this hamiltonian @xmath42 which simplifies the calculation considerably . here",
    "@xmath43 is the atomic energy level of the localized mn @xmath44-electrons and @xmath45 is the anderson - hubbard repulsive parameter ; @xmath46 is the occupation operator for the manganese @xmath23 - electrons on the impurities , labelled @xmath47 in ( iii , mn)v dms .",
    "the situations when the degeneracy of the @xmath23 states is important and the exchange interaction ( hund rule ) in the multielectron atom starts playing an essential part will be outlined and the appropriate corrections will be introduced , when necessary .",

    "the direct overlaps between the @xmath11-electron wave functions of the neighboring impurities in the dms and the coulomb interaction between them are neglected .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the orbital degeneracy of the @xmath23 states is not taken into account in this simplified model .",
    "in reality , the orbital quantum numbers are important at least in three respects .",
    "first , the half - filled @xmath52 subshell of mn is occupied by @xmath24 and @xmath23 electrons with parallel spins in accordance with the hund rule , so the sixth electron can be captured in the @xmath53 configuration only with the opposite spin .",
    "the energy cost of this capture is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the exchange energy .",
    "this feature of the impurity is preserved in the above simplified hamiltonian : ( [ and2 ] ) the reaction @xmath56 is changed for @xmath57 , with the spin of the second electron opposite to the first one .",
    "the energy cost of this reaction is @xmath45 , and the principal features of the ion , important for the formation of the localized magnetic moment , are practically the same as in the original atom .",
    "second , it is the hund rule that requires that the total angular moments of the mn atoms be parallel to allow the indirect inter - impurity interaction between the high - spin @xmath52 states via the _ hh _ valence band states .",
    "we will take the hund rule explicitly into account , when calculating @xmath4 , and it will be shown below , that the energy gain due to this indirect interaction , monitored by the hund rule , leads eventually to ferromagnetic ordering in dms s .",
    "third , the three - fold degeneracy of the @xmath23 electrons is also manifested in the statistics of the localized states , and therefore it influences the position of the fermi energy in the energy gap .",
    "these statistics are described in the appendix .",
    "the degeneracy introduces also numerical factors in the effective exchange constants .",
    "these factors are also calculated in the appendix .",
    "having all this in mind , we proceed with the derivation of the indirect inter - impurity exchange within the framework of the non - degenerate alexander - anderson model , whereas the corresponding corrections for the real orbital structure of the mn ion will be made when necessary . to calculate the energy of the exchange interaction between two magnetic impurities , one should find the electronic spectrum of the semiconductor in the presence of two impurities .",
    "each impurity perturbs the host electron spectrum within a radius @xmath58 .",
    "inter - impurity interaction arises , provided the distance between the impurities @xmath59 is comparable with @xmath60 .",
    "general equations for the two - impurity states and the corresponding contribution to the exchange energy are derived in appendix .",
    "here we present only the final equations , which will be used in the derivation of the effective exchange coupling and the curie temperatures for the specific dms s .",
    "the quantity , which we actually need here is the impurity related correction to the energy of the system .",
    "it is given by the standard formula ( see , _",

    "the energy gain results from the indirect spin - dependent inter - impurity overlap , and the mechanism of the effective exchange interaction may be qualified as kinematic exchange . in general",
    ", double exchange favors a fm order , because the splitting of the energy levels belonging to two adjacent impurities occurs due to electron hopping via unoccupied band or impurity - related states _ without spin reversal_. were the impurity angular moments non - parallel , the hund rule would suppress the probability of the electron , with spin parallel to the first impurity angular momentum , to hop onto the second impurity with a `` wrong '' direction of the angular momentum .",
    "the level splitting , when not suppressed by the hund rule , results in an energy decrease provided that not all of the available band and impurity levels are occupied .",
    "one should note that this kinematic exchange can not be reduced to any conventional double exchange mechanism because of an actual interplay between three contributions to the magnetic energy , namely , the scattered valence band electrons , the cfr states and the dbh states .",

    "after some simplifications this approach led us to a microscopic hamiltonian similar to a two - center anderson model.@xcite that model was developed for metallic hosts , whereas we consider a semiconductor host .",
    "the model allows for analytical solutions , and the final equation ( [ curie ] ) for @xmath4 with the effective coupling constant ( [ ehol ] ) should be compared with the phenomenological mean - field equation @xcite @xmath274 where @xmath236 is the lattice constant , @xmath275 is the phenomenological @xmath114-exchange constant , @xmath276 is the magnetic susceptibility of holes in the valence band . in principle , eq .",
    "( [ curie ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ oh ] ) consist of similar ingredients .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath275 in the phenomenological model stems from the hybridization .",
    "then it may be derived in the anderson - type model by means of the usual schrieffer - wolff transformation , so that @xmath277 .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "( [ ehol ] ) one can easily discern corresponding contributions , which in fact were proposed for dilute magnets four decades ago .",
    "@xcite the second fraction in eq .",
    "( [ oh ] ) is proportional to @xmath278 , i.e. to the fermi momentum of holes in the valence band .",
    "_ unlike _ the phenomenological model , which deals with localized spins and free holes near the top of the valence band , our model takes into account the change in the density of hole states ( and therefore in their magnetic response ) due to resonance scattering and impurity band formation .",
    "one of the results of this change is a more complicated dependence of the magnetic coupling on the mn content @xmath96 than the linear law predicted by eq .",
    "( [ oh ] ) .",
    "another improvement of the mean - field theory taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ curie ] ) is a more refined description of the impurity magnetic moment .",
    "the actual moment @xmath279 arises as a vector sum of the moments of the d - electrons and the bound p - hole , one should emphasize that at a high enough concentration all mean - field descriptions fail because the alloy approaches the instability region and the mn distribution becomes strongly inhomogeneous . in the case of ga@xmath188mn@xmath189as this is , apparently , the region of @xmath280 .",
    "next , one should discuss the relation between our approach and the so called `` ab initio '' numerical calculations by means of the local - density functional method.@xcite doping by mn atoms is modelled in these calculations by means of a finite - size cluster of a gaas or gan host with one or several atoms replaced by mn .",
    "then periodic structures are constructed from magnetic clusters ( `` supercells '' ) and the electronic bands in these artificial objects are calculated in the local - spin - density approximations ( lsda ) .",
    "so , the starting point in our approach and the lsda calculations is the same .",
    "no wonder that the positions of cfr and dbh levels in these calculations are in good agreement with those used in our model , based on previous single impurity calculations.@xcite however , a direct comparison of the two procedures , as far as the magnetic properties are concerned , is somewhat problematic .",
    "the self - consistent lsda method results _ by construction _ only in a stoner - like itinerant magnetism .",
    "therefore , magnetic states are discussed in refs . in terms of exchange splitting and majority / minority spin subbands .",
    "it is difficult to discern the genuine kinematic double exchange in this type of calculations .    to overcome this difficulty , sanvito _ et al _",
    "@xcite tried to fit their ldsa calculation by a free - electron model with an effective hole mass @xmath281 and uniformly distributed impurities described by a model square potential containing spin - independent and exchange components ( @xmath282 and @xmath283 , respectively ) .",
    "such separation is purely phenomenological .",
    "it ignores the resonance origin of the exchange potential . besides , short - range impurity scattering can not be described in the effective mass approximation.@xcite nevertheless , the estimate of the magnetic component @xmath284 ev is in a good agreement with the corresponding parameter of our theory @xmath285 ev for the parameters used in the fitting of fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] ( the value of @xmath286 ev is irrelevant because of the above mentioned effective mass approximation ) .",
    "one should emphasize , however , that the double - exchange coupling in our model is determined not by this parameter , but by the integral @xmath135 ( [ ehol ] ) , and this difference is in fact the benchmark for the discussion of the differences between the indirect @xmath114 exchange of vonsovskii - zener type @xcite and the kinematic double exchange.@xcite    a simplified picture of the valence band structure used in our model ( single heavy - hole band with semielliptic density of states ) allowed us to describe the dependence @xmath287 using a minimal number of fitting parameters .",
    "we have seen that a good quantitative agreement between theory and experiment could be achieved even with this very restricted set of parameters . with the help of a more realistic energy band scheme ( e.g. by taking the light hole band into account ) , the restrictive symmetry of the density of states would be removed , and the fitting procedure would become more flexible .",
    "we intentionally imposed such severe restrictions on the model to demonstrate its explanatory capabilities .",
    "the above limitations will be lifted in future studies .",
    "further progress in the theoretical description of ferromagnetism in mn - doped semiconductors is intimately related to the progress in sample preparation and characterization . at present",
    "more or less detailed data on @xmath287 in _ p_-type ( ga , mn)as are available , and we succeeded in a quantitative description of these data within our model ( section iii ) .",
    "we expect that the same approach is applicable to _ p_-type ( ga , mn)p , but the scanty experimental data do not allow us to check this expectation . as for ( ga , mn)n , the accumulation of experimental data is in progress , and the most actual task is to reveal distinctions between _ p _ and _ n _ type magnetic alloys .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite confirm existence of magnetic order in @xmath12-(ga , mn)n , although the experimental state - of - the - art is far from providing trustworthy @xmath288 curves for theoretical fitting .",
    "according to our theory , fm order is expected both in @xmath9- and @xmath12-type samples , but the latter case demands a serious modification of the theory ( section iv ) and a direct extrapolation of the semi - empirical formula ( [ oh ] ) is questionable .",
    "another challenging question is the possibility of ferromagnetism in elemental semiconductors and ii - vi compounds doped by mn and , maybe , other magnetic ions and respective modification of the theory .",
    "one can mention the recent reports about magnetism in ge doped by mn @xcite and zno doped by mn and fe @xcite . in the latter case one deals with a wide - gap semiconductor , where magnetic isoelectronic impurities mn@xmath3 and fe@xmath3 replace zn ions .",
    "the theory presented in section iv seems to be applicable in this case .",
    "transition metal ions in ge are as a rule interstitial impurities sometimes involved in formation of complex defects@xcite , so the existing theoretical approaches should be modified for this case .",
