    "continuous - variable quantum key distribution helps two remote parties ( alice and bob ) to establish a set of secret keys at high speed @xcite .",
    "different from discrete - variable protocols , in cv qkd alice encodes information into the quadratures of the optical field and bob decodes it with high - efficiency and high - speed homodyne detection @xcite . besides the experimental advantages and demonstrations , the security of cv qkd is also studied theoretically .",
    "the coherent - state cv - qkd protocol with gaussian modulation has been proved secure under the collective attack @xcite , and the fact that the security bounds for collective and coherent attacks coincide asymptotically has been clarified using quantum de finetti theorem @xcite .",
    "however , the security of practical cv - qkd system has only been noticed recently @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that adding noise in the error - correction postprocessing may increase the secret key rate @xcite .",

    "more recently , weedbrook _ et al . _ has shown that direct reconciliation cv protocols is more robust against this noise than reverse reconciliation protocols @xcite .    from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "it is meaningful to consider the trusted gaussian source noise which is not controlled by the potential eavesdropper eve . to analyze this source - noise effect , it is convenient to use the entanglement - based ( eb ) scheme to evaluate cv - qkd security .",
    "note that two requirements for the eb scheme should be satisfied here .",
    "first , the eb scheme is kept equivalent to the practical prepare and measure ( pm ) scheme @xcite .",
    "second , in the eb scheme the optimality of gaussian attack is guaranteed under the collective attack . from this viewpoint ,",
    "a three - mode entangled - state model has been proposed in @xcite as a preliminary attempt . however , the security bound in that paper is not tight , since in order to derive a calculable bound the model assumes that the source noise is untrusted , from which eve is able to acquire extra information .",
    "another attempt @xcite used a beam - splitter model [ fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) ] , analogous to the realistic detector model @xcite , to characterize the source noise .    in this paper",

    "a neutral party fred introduces gaussian source noise through a general gaussian transformation . without knowing fred s exact state , a security bound",
    "can be derived which is tighter than previous work @xcite .",
    "we also analyze the performance of the beam - splitter model under situations where source noise process includes either signal amplification or attenuation , and make comparisons with our result .",
    "before the explicit description of our model , the definition of the covariance matrix of a quantum state is briefly reviewed . for an n - mode quantum state , its covariance matrix @xmath0 is defined by @xmath1,\\ ] ] where the operator vector is @xmath2 and the displacement vector is @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the quadratures of each optical field mode .",
    "the eb scheme of the beam - splitter model and our model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . in the beam - splitter model",
    "the source is characterized by an epr state held by alice .",
    "then an extra epr state interacts with either mode of the original one , depending on whether the source noise process amplifies or attenuates the signal , to introduce the noise .",
