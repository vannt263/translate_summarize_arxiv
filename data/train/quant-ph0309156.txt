    "quantum entanglement is one of the most important phenomenon in quantum theory .",
    "it exhibit the nature of nonlocal correlation between quantum systems , and plays an essential role in various fields of quantum information processing , such as quantum computation , quantum communication , quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation@xcite , and closely related to quantum channel@xcite.after the first experiments @xcite on quantum teleportation using two - mode squeezed states @xcite@xcite , a significant amount of work has been devoted to develop a quantum information theory of continuous variable systems .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical work has focused on the entanglement properties of the quantum states involved in all these experiments , the so - called gaussian states .",
    "the first problem arisen is that if a given quantum gaussian state is entangled , the problem of qualifying entanglement has been solved in the general bipartite setting @xcite@xcite .",
    "but the efficiency of entanglement manipulation protocols used in practical quantum information processing critically depends on the quality of the entanglement that one can generate .",
    "it is therefore essential to be able to quantify the amount of entanglement in systems with continuous variables especially gaussian states .",
    "several measures have been proposed to quantify the amount of entanglement @xcite .",
    "among which are the entanglement of formation , relative entropy of entanglement and distillation entanglement .",
    "entanglement of formation is one of the most important entanglement measures . for symmetric guassian state ,",
    "this entanglement measure can be carried out analytically @xcite . for general bipartite",
    "gaussian state , another entanglement measure called gaussian entanglement of formation was introduced@xcite .",
    "clearly it is the up bound of the entanglement of formation .",
    "relative entropy of entanglement@xcite @xcite on the other hand measures the distance between the state under consideration to the closest separable state .",
    "it has the advantage that separable states obviously correspond to zero distance . for pure states of bipartite systems",
    "it reduces to the von neumann entropy of the reduced state of either subsystem . for mixed bipartite states it is usually difficult",
    "to be  calculated , except for some specific states .",
    "the distance of the gaussian state to the set of separable gaussian states measured by the relative entropy was considered @xcite .",
    "although one has yet no proof that there does not exist a non - gaussian separable state which is closer to the gaussian state under consideration than the closest separable gaussian state , one has good reason to think that it is a good bound of entanglement measure .",
    "however , the expression derived @xcite is still not easy for a direct numeric calculation .",
    "recently the bound on the relative entropy of entanglement was calculated for two modes squeezed symmetric thermal state@xcite . in this paper",
    "i  will consider the more practical used state of two mode squeezed non - symmetric themal state , which is to be distributed between two parties by means of a lossy optical fiber in asymmetric settings for an initial two mode squeezed vacuum state@xcite.i will concentrate on its gaussian entanglement of formation and its up bound of relative entropy of entanglement . according to the hypothesis of hashing inequality@xcite",
    ", all this entanglement measures should be lower bounded by coherent information .",
    "i will at last compare the results with coherent information of the state .",
    "gaussian state is completely specified by its mean and its covariance matrix , where the mean can be dropped by local unitary operation so that is irrelevant for entanglement problems .",
    "let us consider  a quantum gaussian state @xmath0 of two system a and b acting on a hilbert space @xmath1 .",

    "it is convenient to describe gaussian state density operator @xmath0 by its characteristic function .",

    "a characteristic function @xmath7 uniquely defines a state @xmath8 .",
    "gaussian state is state",
    "whose @xmath7 is gaussian function of @xmath9 : @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is a real symmetric matrix , called correlation matrix .",
    "any gaussian state of two modes can be transformed into what we called the standard form , using local unitary operation only @xcite @xcite .",
    "the corresponding characteristic function has displacement @xmath12 and the correlation matrix has the simple form of four parameters .",
    "it was proved that ( see @xcite and reference therein , also see @xcite and reference therein ) : for arbitrary real symmetric matrix @xmath11 there exists linear transformation ( symplectic transformation ) @xmath13 , preserving canonical commutation relations , then @xmath14 this is to say that by proper symplectic transformation , gaussian state can be transformed into a direct product of thermal states @xmath15 . the one mode thermal state density operators are of the forms @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the symplectic transformation @xmath20 induces a unitary operator @xmath21 so that @xmath22 @xcite@xcite , and @xmath23 . for @xmath24 is a direct product of thermal states .",
