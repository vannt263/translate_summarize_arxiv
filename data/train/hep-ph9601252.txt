    "with the commissioning of new powerful facilities with high production rates , low- and medium - energy meson physics will experience renewed interest .",
    "@xmath3 physics at higher energies and @xmath4 physics at lower energies have stimulated large efforts on the experimental as well as the theoretical side ; the field of @xmath5 and @xmath6 physics provides a considerable amount of open questions , and the new facilities are expected to address them from the experimental side .",
    "the anticipated numbers of @xmath7 - @xmath8 observed etas per year at celsius ( @xmath9 ) , itep ( @xmath10 ) and da@xmath11ne ( @xmath12 ) @xcite will allow for experiments which on the one hand supply precise figures on the more frequent eta decays and which on the other hand focus on rare eta decays .",
    "such rare decays can supply valuable information on anomalous processes or a possible @xmath13 violation in eta decays .",
    "another interesting question is whether it will be feasible to observe some of the rare eta decays at the new laser backscattering facility graal at grenoble ( @xmath14 decay events per second ) or even at the @xmath15 electron facilities at mainz ( mami ) , bonn ( elsa ) and newport news ( cebaf ) , where many eta photo- and electroproduction experiments are scheduled or already being carried through . on the theoretical side the development of chiral perturbation theory @xcite as an effective theory for the confinement phase of qcd has supplied a consistent framework for the calculation of low - energy processes in the @xmath16 as well as the @xmath17 flavor sector of qcd .",
    "chiral perturbation theory has turned out to be a valuable tool in the investigation of meson interactions at low energies",
    ". however , the theory seems to work much better in the @xmath16 sector than in the @xmath17 sector due to the comparatively large mass of the strange quark . in particular , processes involving the eta meson have confronted chiral perturbation theory with various problems which could only be solved partly by considering next - to - leading - order terms and electromagnetic corrections or by going even beyond next - to - leading order ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these problems are also related to the large mixing angle and the @xmath18 problem . in pure chiral perturbation theory up to @xmath19 , the eta singlet field is integrated out @xcite , because the mass of the corresponding physical @xmath6 , @xmath20 , is larger than the low - energy scale @xmath21 . on the other hand , current - algebra - like calculations with phenomenologically",
    "determined decay constants and @xmath5 - @xmath6 mixing , which keep the eta singlet field as an explicit degree of freedom , yield reasonable results .",
    "since we will restrict our calculation of the process @xmath22 to tree level , we will choose such a phenomenologically inspired approach .",
    "the charged mode of this process is of particular interest , because it can supply information on a wess - zumino - witten contact term @xcite involving the interaction of three mesons and two photons ( for a review of anomalous processes see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the eta meson is the only particle of the pseudoscalar octet which decays through such a mechanism .",
    "another possibility of testing this special kind of contact term in a scattering experiment is the process @xmath23 which has recently been treated in chiral perturbation theory @xcite . due to the lack of meson collision facilities , it is difficult to extract information on this vertex from a scattering experiment with a meson in the initial state , because in practice such experiments involve virtual particles and necessitate uncertain extrapolations . on the experimental side",
    "a data analysis dating back to the sixties with rather low statistics gives upper bounds on the branching ratios of the charged mode @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25 in the analyses @xcite and @xcite the upper limits for the branching ratios were derived for a missing mass of neutral particles larger than @xmath26 .",
    "hopefully , the situation will improve when future experiments will be carried through .",
    "the four - momenta and polarization vectors for the charged decay mode @xmath27 are defined in fig .  1 .",
    "for the neutral decay mode we use analogous descriptors .",
    "the full kinematics of a decay process with four particles in the final state requires five independent kinematical variables ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the definition of these variables we will consider three reference frames : the rest system of the eta meson @xmath28 , the dipion center - of - mass system @xmath29 , and the diphoton center - of - mass system @xmath30 .",
    "our kinematical variables are ( see fig .",
    "2 )    * @xmath31 , the square of the center - of - mass energy of the pions , * @xmath32 , the square of the center - of - mass energy of the photons , * @xmath33 , the angle of the pion with momentum @xmath34 in @xmath29 with respect to the direction of flight of the dipion in @xmath28 , * @xmath35 , the angle of the photon with momentum @xmath36 in @xmath30 with respect to the direction of flight of the diphoton in @xmath28 , * @xmath37 , the angle between the plane formed by the pions in @xmath28 and the corresponding plane formed by the photons .    in order to define these variables more precisely we introduce a unit vector @xmath38 along the direction of flight of the dipion in @xmath28 , and unit vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 along the projections of @xmath41 perpendicular to @xmath38 and of @xmath42 perpendicular to @xmath43 , respectively , @xmath44^{1/2},\\\\ { \\hat{d } } & = & \\left ( \\vec q_1 - { \\hat{v } } { \\hat{v } } \\cdot \\vec q_1 \\right ) / \\left[\\vec q_1^{\\,2 } - \\left(\\vec q_1 \\cdot { \\hat{v } } \\right)^2   \\right]^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these definitions the five kinematical variables are defined as follows : @xmath45 the physical region of the decay process is reflected in the range of the kinematical variables : @xmath46 the invariant matrix element squared , @xmath47 , will be expressed in terms of lorentz scalar products of the five momenta @xmath34,@xmath48,@xmath36 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "one of these momentum vectors can be eliminated because of momentum conservation . in order to express the lorentz scalar products in terms of the kinematical variables specified above we now introduce adequate linear combinations of the momenta : @xmath51 for further reference we need the expressions @xmath52,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 the ten lorentz scalar products in @xmath54",
    "can now be expressed as follows : @xmath55 the differential decay rate can be written as @xmath56 where the symmetry factor @xmath13 is equal to @xmath57 in the decay @xmath58 because of two pairs of identical particles in the final state , and equal to @xmath59 in the decay @xmath24 because of one identical particle pair in the final state .",
    "now we will proceed to investigate how chiral dynamics manifests itself in the lorentz - invariant matrix element @xmath60 .",
    "we will restrict our calculation of @xmath60 to the leading - order contributions .",
    "since the process @xmath22 involves the electromagnetic interaction of an odd number of pseudoscalar mesons , the leading contributions must contain a vertex of odd intrinsic parity .",
    "such a vertex is at least of @xmath61 in the momentum expansion , and thus , according to weinberg s power counting @xcite , we expect the leading contribution to be of @xmath61",
    ". consequently , the interaction lagrangian we will use for our tree - level calculation contains the standard @xmath62 piece @xcite and the anomalous wess - zumino - witten lagrangian @xcite , but no terms from the gasser - leutwyler lagrangian @xcite of @xmath61 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 . in eq .",

    "the meson field operators are represented by the matrix @xmath73 , where the nonet field matrix @xmath11 can be decomposed into an octet and a singlet part , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the expansion of @xmath77 the decay constants @xmath78 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 will be inserted for the constant @xmath81 , depending on whether the constant belongs to a @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 field .",
    "we will use @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 as numerical values @xcite .",
    "our calculation in chiral perturbation theory will be carried out with the group theoretical octet and singlet eta states , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we will introduce @xmath5-@xmath6 mixing via the phenomenological mixing angle @xmath90 @xcite : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    , \\\\",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing to the charged decay mode @xmath27 of @xmath61 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ feyndiagcharged ] .",
    "there are three different classes of diagrams at tree level : diagrams with a four - meson vertex of @xmath62 , a propagating neutral meson , and a decay vertex into two photons of @xmath61 ( class 1 ) , wess - zumino - witten contact terms of @xmath61 ( class 2 ) and internal bremsstrahlung diagrams , where one photon is emitted off a charged pion line ( classes 3.1 and 3.2 ) .",
    "the first class of diagrams is gauge invariant by itself , whereas the amplitudes corresponding to the diagrams from the second and third class have to be added in order to obtain gauge invariance . in the neutral decay mode @xmath92 only the first class of diagrams",
    "is relevant ( fig .",
    "[ feyndiagneutral ] ) .    starting from the general chiral lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ genlag ] ) , we now list the interaction terms relevant for the process @xmath93 : @xmath94 the invariant amplitude for @xmath27 is then given as the sum of the amplitudes from the three classes of feynman diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ feyndiagcharged ] ) , @xmath95 where @xmath96 the masses in the propagators can be expressed in terms of the physical masses using the relations @xmath97 as we will not be concerned with photon polarizations in the final state , we carry out the sum over the polarizations of the real photons , @xmath98 for that purpose we exploit the completeness relation @xmath99 which is based on current conservation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath100 the result for @xmath101 is too complicated to be displayed in this contribution .",
    "it depends on all lorentz scalar products which can be constructed from the four final - state momentum vectors @xmath34 , @xmath48 , @xmath36 and @xmath49 .    for the neutral decay mode @xmath58 we obtain the interactions @xmath102 which lead to the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ feyndiagneutral ] and result in the lorentz - invariant matrix element @xmath103 summing over the possible photon polarizations @xmath104 and @xmath105 we obtain a compact result for the invariant matrix element squared , @xmath106 we note that the final result only depends on one lorentz scalar product , namely @xmath107 .",
    "having determined @xmath108 we proceed to investigate the decay spectra by integrating eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) numerically .",
    "first we will discuss the dalitz plot @xmath109 for the charged decay mode .",
    "we note that the soft - photon limit for any of the two photons implies @xmath110 . the contour plot for the full chiral perturbation theory calculation ( fig .",
    "[ dalfull ] ) clearly shows the infrared bremsstrahlung singularity for @xmath110 .",
    "the dalitz plot also reflects a pole at @xmath111 due to the class 1 feynman diagram with a propagating @xmath112 ( see fig .  [ feyndiagcharged ] ) . in the neighborhood of this pole it is impossible to distinguish between the processes @xmath27 and @xmath113 .",
    "if we switch off the diagrams of class 1 , the invariant amplitude is still gauge invariant , and the corresponding dalitz plot ( fig .",
    "[ dalwithoutpole ] ) is very similar to the full calculation ( fig .",
    "[ dalfull ] ) except for the region around the @xmath112 pole .",
    "we conclude that the diagrams of class 1 do not contribute significantly to the process which also becomes evident from the diphoton spectrum @xmath114 ( fig .",
    "[ dipion ] ) , where @xmath115 . the effect of the @xmath112 pole is confined to a very small region around @xmath116 .",
    "the calculation without class 1 diagrams almost coincides with the full calculation except for this region . the reaction mechanisms of class 2 and class 3 diagrams dominate the spectrum over a wide energy range .",
    "we conclude that the detection of this decay mode should be a good indication for the presence of a wess - zumino - witten contact term ( class 2 ) . towards small values of @xmath32 the bremsstrahlung diagrams ( class 3 ) will be responsible for a divergence in the spectrum . a measurement of the steep rise in the spectrum for vanishing @xmath32 depends on the resolution of the detector facilities or , more accurately speaking , on the minimum photon energy detectable .",
    "hence , in both experiment and theory it is only possible to determine the partial decay rate as a function of an energy cut @xmath117 applied around @xmath118 .",
    "we obtained @xmath119 by integrating the diphoton spectrum for the calculation without class 1 diagrams . according to fig .",
    "[ dipion ] the error introduced by this approximation should be negligible . in fig .",
    "[ partialwidthcharged ] we show the result as a function of @xmath117 . comparing our absolute numbers for the partial decay rate with the total eta decay rate @xmath120 @xcite",
    ", we note that the resulting branching ratio is well within the reach of the facilities mentioned in the introduction .",
    "using an energy cut at @xmath121 , our result for the partial decay rate is smaller than the experimental upper limits in eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) by about three orders of magnitude .",
    "let us now turn to the neutral decay mode @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast to the charged decay mode , where the diagrams of class 1 can be neglected , these diagrams generate the only tree - level contributions in the case of neutral mesons . for this reason we want to analyse the structure of the vertices in the diagrams more closely .",
    "whereas the two - photon - one - meson vertices have been investigated extensively in the two - photon decays of the @xmath112 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the four - meson vertices , in particular the @xmath122 interaction , are not known with comparable precision . however , these vertices are of great interest , because they are directly related to the sum or difference of the light quark masses ( see eq .",
    "( [ masseq ] ) ) . while the @xmath123 and @xmath124 interaction can be directly investigated in the decays @xmath125 and @xmath126 ,",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath127 interaction .",
    "moreover , the minimum center - of - mass energy for the scattering process @xmath128 is beyond the convergence radius of chiral perturbation theory , and @xmath129 scattering is not a realistic alternative either . as a consequence , the only possibility to get",
    "information on the @xmath127 interaction is the investigation of a composite process with at least one additional vertex . at first glance",
    "the decay @xmath92 seems to be a good candidate since @xmath130 parity is conserved at the @xmath131 vertex , whereas in the diagram with a propagating @xmath112 the corresponding vertex violates @xmath130 parity and vanishes in the isospin limit .",
    "however , as is well - known from the decay @xmath125 , @xmath130 parity is violated significantly and isospin breaking is reflected by the fact that the @xmath123 vertex function is directly proportional to the quark mass difference ( see eqs .",
    "( [ vpvc ] ) and ( [ masseq ] ) ) .",
    "for this reason the diagram with the propagating neutral pion can not be neglected .",
    "since @xmath132 lies within the range of integration for @xmath32 , the diagram with a propagating @xmath112 will cause a pole in the amplitude @xmath60 . thus , despite @xmath130 parity and isospin violation , this diagram is strongly enhanced in comparison with the diagrams with a propagating @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the diphoton spectrum clearly demonstrates the fact that the @xmath122 interaction plays a minor role in the process ( see fig .  [ diphoton00 ] ) .    in the pole region",
    "it is impossible to distinguish the decay mode @xmath133 from @xmath134 .",
    "thus , in order to obtain new information on chiral dynamics from the decay @xmath133 , one should choose an energy regime for @xmath32 which is sufficiently far away from this pole .    at @xmath135 effective chiral lagrangians do not reproduce the experimentally determined interaction strength of the @xmath136 and @xmath137 vertices ( for the correct treatment beyond tree level see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we have also performed a phenomenological calculation , where we fixed these interactions using the experimentally observed branching ratios @xcite @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "whereas experimental data agree very well with a _ constant _ tree - level prediction for @xmath140 , such an assumption does not seem to work so well for @xmath141 ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is of only minor importance in our case , because the pole at @xmath142 in the amplitude is far outside the physical region of @xmath32 .",
    "it turns out that the result with the vertices fixed by experiment is larger than the prediction of chiral perturbation theory by about one order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , we also found that @xmath82-@xmath5 and @xmath82-@xmath6 mixing according to @xcite is negligible in this process .",
    "future work will focus on higher - order corrections to our tree - level calculation .",
    "the question whether it is realistic to measure the decay @xmath92 must be decided from the partial decay rate @xmath143 , which we obtain by integration of the diphoton spectrum applying a cut of the width @xmath144 around the pole at @xmath145 ( fig .",
    "[ neutraltot ] ) . from this figure",
    "it becomes obvious that this partial decay rate is rather small , but possibly within the reach of the new eta facilities .",
    "however , it will probably be impossible to draw any precise information on the @xmath130-parity - conserving @xmath146 coupling from measuring this process , because the corresponding feynman diagram gives only a small contribution to the complete amplitude .",
    "finally , we want to mention that the calculation in @xcite based on old experimental data yields @xmath147 .",
    "we conclude that the rare eta decay @xmath27 is an interesting test of the anomalous lagrangian , because it is a simple way to access the three - meson - two - photon vertex predicted by @xcite and @xcite and allows for a consistency check with the results from @xmath148 .",
