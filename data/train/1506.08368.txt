    "light - harvesting molecular complexes achieve the energy transfer by using an array of light - harvesting pigments that absorb the energy to form excitons and funnel the excitation to the reaction center @xcite . to investigate the energy transfer dynamics in the first steps of photosynthesis on the fs time scale , ultrafast spectroscopic tools are available . among the techniques used , two - dimensional ( 2d )",
    "photon echo spectroscopy is a powerful tool which allows for direct mapping of the excitation energy pathways as a function of absorption and emission wavelength @xcite .",
    "it is particularly useful in examining photosynthetic systems in which the manifold of electronic states is closely spaced and broadening through static disorder yields highly congested spectra .",
    "recent experimental 2d electronic spectroscopic studies of the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex observed coherent beating signals and , thus , raised interest in the interplay between energy transfer , long - lived quantum coherence in photosynthetic processes @xcite , and low - frequency vibrations of the molecular back bone . also in photoactive marine cryptophyte algae @xcite , the light - harvesting complex lh2 @xcite of _ rhodobacter sphaeroides _ , and in the reaction center @xcite of the photosystem ii",
    ", long - lived oscillations have been experimentally observed at low ( 77 k ) and room temperatures ( 300 k ) , indicating a strong vibronic coupling in these systems .    to analyze the experimental findings in such large and complex photoactive molecular complexes ,",
    "a thorough comparison with theoretical calculations is essential , in order to arrive at a reliable interpretation of the measured 2d spectra . since it is a difficult and computationally demanding task to determine 2d optical spectra , often only the population dynamics of exciton states is calculated . for the fmo complex , a rather small light - harvesting complex ,",
    "the hierarchical equations of motion @xcite were applied and quantum oscillations were observed on the time scale of the 2d experiments employing an environmental debye model spectral density with rather small reorganization energy @xcite . employing the numerically exact quasiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) allowed to use a more realistic measured environmental spectral density . however , this resulted in a decay of the decoherence faster than experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "this spectral density could , more recently , be employed to calculate the 2d spectra of fmo with the hierarchy equation @xcite and a reasonable agreement between theory and experiment could be achieved .",
    "the calculations of quapi and the hierarchical equations of motion treated the coupling of the complex to environmental fluctuations numerically exactly . however , the computational effort is immense , which makes the simulation of larger light - harvesting molecular complexes ( which contain , typically , dozens to hundreds of excitonic subunits ) virtually impossible .",
    "the need for a highly efficient numerical tool to calculate 2d optical spectra of large molecular complexes with a reasonable numerical effort and a satisfactory accuracy still exists and it is expected to continue to increase .    given their complex molecular structures , for the calculation of 2d spectra of large light - harvestors , approximate schemes are usually inavoidable .",
    "standard redfield equations @xcite , which invoke a lowest - order born and a markovian approximation , are good at weak system - bath coupling , but fail for strong coupling .",
    "the regime of intermediate system - bath coupling as present for the exciton dynamics in photoactive complexes @xcite is typically also not properly treated within redfield equations @xcite .",
    "thus , the _ modified _ redfield theory ( mrt ) has been widely used for the description of energy transfer processes of large molecules @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "that contribution of the system - bath coupling hamiltonian , which is diagonal in the eigenbasis of the system , is included fully , while a second - order perturbative approximation is used for the off - diagonal coupling terms .",
    "the equation of motion of the mrt includes a population transfer within the reduced density matrix , but the accompanying population - transfer induced dephasing is neglected .",
    "the accuracy of the mrt in view of the dynamics of the reduced density matrix has been analyzed in detail @xcite .",
    "moreover , mrt has been shown to have a somewhat wider range of applicability when compared to both the original redfield and frster theory @xcite .",
    "also , linear absorption spectra for an ensemble of b850 rings have been determined which shows that mrt includes non - markovian effects which clearly show up in the high - energy part of the static absorption lineshapes @xcite .",
    "different energy transfer components of lhcii trimer and phycoerythrin 545 have been revealed using mrt by simultaneous quantitative fits of the absorption , linear dichroism , steady - states fluorescence spectra , and transient absorption kinetics upon excitation at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "a more refined description of the quantum dissipative exciton dynamics is achieved in this work upon observing that the population - transfer induced electronic dephasing can be efficiently included in the quantum master equation .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in the quantum master equation now include the decoherence of excited states and electronic dephasing between ground and excited states by exploiting the relation @xmath0 to estimate the different contributions to the dephasing rate , where @xmath1 is the transverse relaxation time and @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the longitudinal relaxation time and pure dephasing time , respectively .",
    "while working out the details with the results reported in this paper , this extended quantum master equation has also been independently put forward very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been named the coherent modified redfield theory ( cmrt ) .",
    "to avoid confusion , we use to this nomenclature also here .    for calculating 2d photon - echo spectra ,",
    "essentially two different approaches are available . on the one hand ,",
    "the response to the sequence of applied laser pulses can be calculated by evaluating the third - order optical response function @xcite .",
    "modified redfield theory was successfully applied to simulate the 2d spectra of the double - ring lh2 aggregate of purple bacteria including both the b800 and the b850 ring @xcite .",
    "comparing experimentally measured and theoretically calculated results of 2d spectra revealed that excitation energy transfer through the lhcii happens on three time scales : sub-100fs relaxation through spatially overlapping states , several hundred femtosecond transfer between nearby chlorophylls , and picosecond energy transfer steps between layers of pigments @xcite .",
    "more recently , 2d spectra of the reaction center in the photosystem ii were calculated with mrt at low temperature , and the charge separation process was investigated by mrt including charge transfer states in the model @xcite .    an alternative approach to calculate 2d optical spectra , which is especially useful when finite durations of the laser pulses as well as pulse overlap effects are taken into account , is the equation of motion - phase matching approach ( pma ) @xcite . using the pma in combination with the conventional redfield equations , 2d spectra of a single fmo subunit were studied , and the signature of energy transfer was revealed by well - resolved peaks in the simulation with adjustable pure dephasing of exciton states @xcite .",
    "although mrt is used to tackle many different problems in the study energy transport in photosynthetic complexes , no investigation of its reliability in calculating nonlinear and , specifically , 2d optical spectra is at hand . in this work ,",
    "we first verify the cmrt approach by comparing the population dynamics of fmo exciton states with numerically exact results of the quapi approach .",
    "in addition , we combine the cmrt with the pma to calculate 2d photon - echo spectra for a simple dimer model . again",
    ", the results of cmrt+pma are benchmarked against numerically exact results of the quapi approach .",
    "for the long - time steady state dynamics , the cmrt+pma and quapi simulations show differences for intermediate and strong system - bath coupling .",
    "however , for intermediate coupling , as it is typical in photosynthetic complexes , the short time dynamics including dephasing times and coherent beating frequencies are well described by cmrt+pma .",
    "hence , an efficient numerical scheme to calculate 2d photon - echo spectra with a reasonable computational effort is available .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized in the following way . in the next section [ sec.model ]",
    ", we briefly introduce the model of the fmo complex , for we compare the performance of the the cmrt+pma in calculating a non - trivial population dynamics . additionally , the dimer model is introduced for which we compare results of 2d photon echo spectra .",

    "we give the results of the comparison , and a thorough discussion is appended in section [ sec.disc ] , before we finish with a conclusion .",

    "then , the population transfer term is also derived based on the second - order perturbation approximation , which is one of the reasons for the explanation of the slightly too fast decay of the oscillations found in cmrt calculations .",
    "furthermore , the secular approximation was used to separate the population dynamics and the dephasing process in eqs .",
    "[ eq : diagonal population ] , [ eq : off - diagonal population ] .",
    "this also contributes to the discrepancy in the decay rate , since it neglects the interference between population transfer and coherence dephasing .",
    "a relatively small amplitude of peak b and c was found in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagonal_dynamics ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : anti - diagonal_dynamics ] and it also can be observed by eye in the 2d map for the long waiting time @xmath113 fs .",
    "we observe that peaks b and c are mainly formed by one positive ( red ) peak and overlap with a negative ( blue ) peak in the 2d spectrum ( @xmath113 fs ) .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of those peaks mainly depends on the overlap of two peaks . in the quapi result ,",
    "the two peaks are clearly separated with a larger spectral distance than in the cmrt result and this leads to the larger amplitude of peaks b and c in the 2d spectrum calculated with quapi .",
    "it indicates that , besides the shifted oscillation and the faster decay of the oscillation , cmrt does not properly account for the reorganization energy by the heat bath ( diagonal peaks show slightly different positions in the 2d map : @xmath119 @xmath33 and @xmath120 @xmath33 for cmrt and @xmath121 @xmath33 and @xmath122 @xmath33 for quapi ) . in the cmrt ,",
    "the reorganization energy is included in the diagonal part of the hamiltonian by eq .",
    "[ eq : renormalization ] , where it just brings in a shift of the excitonic transition frequency @xmath123 by the renormalization term eq .   [ eq : renormalization ] and does not affect the dynamics of the off - diagonal terms in the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian of mrt ] ) .",
    "amplitude of the diagonal peaks a and b for a stronger system - bath coupling @xmath21=100 @xmath33 ( with @xmath22=100 @xmath33 unchanged ) .",
    "cmrt+pma calculations yield a faster decay ( a ) as compared to the quapi result ( decay rate extracted from a fit : cmrt+pma : 81 fs , quapi : 146 fs).,width=245 ]     oscillations of the cross peaks ( c , d ) with for a stronger system - bath interaction ( same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagonal_dynamics2 ] ) .",
    "the cross - peak c calculated by cmrt+pma yields a faster decay and a smaller amplitude ( decay rates as obtained from a fit : cmrt+pma : 62 fs , quapi : 177 fs).,width=245 ]    on the basis of a clear physical meaning ( population transfer and dephasing terms ) and for the purpose of an efficient and fast calculation , the secular approximation and the second - order perturbation theory were applied to construct the cmrt . on the one hand , the secular approximation leads to a separation of the population dynamics and dephasing process and avoids any complicated interaction terms between diagonal and off - diagonal parts in the equation of motion . on the other hand ,",
    "the second - order perturbation theory simplifies the population transfers .",
    "it is possible to improve the equation by including higher orders .",
    "however , this renders the equation considerably more complicated and requires more computational resources for the simulation and it is a priori unclear how much this improves the accuracy .",
    "in this paper we present the cmrt and compare it in more detail to the quapi method by calculating the population dynamics of selected fmo exciton sites and the 2d - spectrum of a model dimer .",
    "we found that cmrt provides numerical reliable results as compared to numerically exact quapi calculations for both the population dynamics and 2d spectra , as long as the reorganization energy is not too large compared to the typical energy gap of the system .",
    "most importantly , it requires smaller computational efforts and orders of magnitude shorter calculation times .",
    "it provides us with an efficient approach to study the energy transfer in super - large molecular complexes and to perform complicated 2d simulations .",
    "we found that the 2d profile calculated from cmrt+pma agrees well with the corresponding quapi results .",
    "for a quantitative comparison , the amplitudes of diagonal and cross peaks were extracted from 2d maps and compared to those calculated by quapi .",
    "quantitative agreement was found .",
    "we observe some discrepancies .",
    "in particular , oscillations are shifted , they decay slightly faster , and positions of peaks are slightly shifted .",
    "this becomes more serious if the reorganization energy is increased , which is also the case in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simulation protocol developed here can be used for arbitrary forms of the spectral density .",
    "one can envision an approach where the cmrt method is used to simulate super - large complexes , while numerically exact methods such as quapi play a role in benchmarking the accuracy of the simulations of smaller systems .",
