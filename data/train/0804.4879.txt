    "electromagnetic surface waves at the planar interface of two different materials travel along a direction parallel to the interfacial plane with decaying amplitudes perpendicular to the direction of propagation in both materials .",
    "research on surface - wave propagation can be traced back to about a century ago to zenneck  @xcite and continues to be of technoscientific importance  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", dyakonov surface waves ( dsw ) have attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "these waves can exist at the planar interface of an isotropic material and a uniaxial material , both dielectric , as was shown first by dyakonov @xcite and then enlarged upon by averkiev and dyakonov @xcite .",
    "the isotropic material is not metallic .",
    "later , several researchers considered dsw propagation on increasingly complex bimaterial interfaces such as biaxial - isotropic , uniaxial - uniaxial , and biaxial - biaxial materials  see , e.g. , refs .",
    "dsw propagation is assured when a dispersion equation is satisfied .",
    "this equation arises from having to satisfy the frequency - domain maxwell postulates in both materials as well as the boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "therefore , dsw propagation depends highly on the crystallographic symmetries of the two materials , at least one of which must be birefringent .",
    "calculations for many pairs of materials have shown that conditions for dsw propagation are favored only for a narrow and restricted angular range of propagation directions in the interface @xcite .",
    "the width of this angular existence domain ( aed ) is denoted here by @xmath0 . with the exception of some interfaces involving hypothetical metamaterials  @xcite , @xmath0 for interfaces of non",
    "- magnetic materials are small    in most cases , only a fraction of a degree@xcite .",
    "this makes experimental observation of dsw propagation very difficult .",
    "one of the largest values of @xmath0 has been calculated to be @xmath1  @xcite ; however , in that case one of the materials is calomel , a chalky and dusty material that is impractical to use .",
    "the potential real - life applications envisaged for the use of dsw are numerous  @xcite , including devices for integrated optics , chemical and biological surface sensing , etc . to be able to experimentally launch a dsw , to experimentally detect a dsw , and to possibly control the dsw characteristics , a sufficiently wide aed appears desirable .",
    "that desire motivated this communication .    in a predecessor paper  @xcite",
    ", we looked at the control of dsw propagation at the interface of an electro - optic material , potassium niobate , and an isotropic material through application of an external dc electric field .",
    "now , we examine optimizing the width @xmath0 of the aed by an exploration of the effects of : the crystal orientation , the direction of applied dc electric field , and the strength of the applied dc electric field . considering the planar interface of an isotropic and a birefringent material , both dielectric",
    ", we show in sec .",
    "[ eo ] that @xmath0 can be increased by a large factor  if the birefringent material is susceptible to the pockels effect  by suitable choices of parameters such as the magnitude and orientation of an applied dc electric field , the crystallographic orientation of the birefringent material in relation to the interface , and the refractive index of the isotropic material .",
    "we considered the following problem @xcite .",
    "the half - space @xmath2 is filled with a homogeneous , isotropic , dielectric material with an optical refractive index denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the half - space @xmath4 is filled with a homogeneous , linear , electro - optic material , whose optical relative permittivity matrix is stated as @xmath5 incorporating the pockels effect due to an arbitrarily oriented but uniform dc electric field @xmath6 , the matrix @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 -\\epsilon _ { 1}^{(0)}\\epsilon _ { 2}^{(0 ) } s_6 & \\epsilon _ { 2}^{(0)}(1-\\epsilon _ { 2}^{(0)}s_2 ) & -\\epsilon _",

    ". the electro - optic material can be isotropic , uniaxial , or biaxial , depending on the relative values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , this material may belong to one of 20 crystallographic classes of point group symmetry , in accordance with the relative values of the coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "the rotation matrix @xmath19 in eq .",

    "the matrix @xmath22 involves the angle @xmath23 $ ] with respect to the @xmath24 axis in the @xmath25 plane , and combines a rotation as well as an inversion .",
    "the angles @xmath26 and @xmath27 delineate the orientation of the electro - optic material in the laboratory coordinate system , the full transformation from laboratory coordinates ( @xmath28 ) to those used conventionally for electro - optic materials ( @xmath29 ) being illustrated by nelatury _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the wave vectors on both sides of the interface were taken to lie wholly in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "the field representations based on the maxwell curl postulates in the two half - spaces , the boundary conditions at the interface @xmath30 , and the dispersion equation for dsw propagation are available elsewhere  @xcite . for a simple case like that of the isotropic - uniaxial interface , obtaining a closed - form expression for @xmath0",
    "is relatively easy .",
    "however , for complex cases such as the one we are treating here , that goal is perhaps impossible .",
    "recourse , then , has to be made to numerical methods in order to mount an extensive search for the proper choice of parameters that allow dsw propagation .",
    "a search was carried to maximize @xmath0 in relation to the magnitude and the direction of the dc electric field , the refractive index of the substrate , and the tilt angle @xmath27 .",
    "potassium niobate was chosen as the electro - optic material , because the magnitudes of its electro - optic coefficients are very large .",
    "table 1 shows @xmath27 and @xmath3 values in a neighborhood wherein @xmath0 is a maximum .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta_psi_curves ] shows the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath3 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the dc electric field is @xmath33  v  m@xmath34 .",
    "we found that , around @xmath35 , even a small change in @xmath27 produces a large change in @xmath0 .",
    "the last entry in table 1 shows @xmath36 which is 20 times larger than the result previously reported by us @xcite .",
    "the search for a wider aed was also attempted choosing @xmath37 parallel to @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the same choices of @xmath3 and @xmath27 values .",
    "but we could get only @xmath0 of order @xmath41 .",
    "however , we wish to continue the search hoping for wider aed .",
    "in summary , dyakonov surface waves propagate along interfaces involving birefringent materials over a narrow angular range @xmath0 of the orientation angle @xmath26 . having a larger @xmath0 is helpful for easier generation and detection of dsws .",
    "several attempts have been made to widen this angular existence domain . by considering specific directions of an applied dc electric field and specific values of @xmath27",
    ", we have shown that exploitation of the linear electro - optic ( pockels ) effect has the potential to widen the aed .",
    "the search for higher values of @xmath0 for an arbitrarily oriented dc electric field is still open .",
    "also , one might look into ranges of @xmath27 values for specific values of @xmath26 and various magnitudes and directions of the applied dc electric field .",
