    "i would cite two examples from my own experience .",
    "when i was an undergraduate at princeton university during the years from 1957 to 1961 , he was my adviser .",
    "one of his duties was to assign me topics for my junior paper and for my senior thesis . for my junior paper ,",
    "i was assigned the topic : compare the complementarity and the uncertainty principles of quantum mechanics : which is more fundamental ? for my senior thesis , i was assigned the topic : how to quantize general relativity ? as wheeler taught me , more than half of science is devoted to the asking of the right question , while often less than half is devoted to the obtaining of the correct answer , but not always !     in the same spirit , i would like to offer up here some questions concerning conceptual tensions between gr and qm , which hopefully can be answered in the course of time by experiments , with a view towards probing the tension between the concepts of @xmath1 in gr and @xmath0 in qm .",
    "i hope that it would be appropriate and permissible to ask some questions here concerning this tension .",
    "it is not the purpose of this chapter to present demonstrated results , but to suggest heuristically some interesting avenues of research which might lead to future experimental discoveries .",
    "one question that naturally arises at the border between gr and qm is the following : are there novel experimental or observational ways of studying quantized fields coupled to curved spacetime",
    "?  this question has already arisen in the context of the vacuum embedded in curved spacetime daviesbook , but i would like to extend this to possible experimental studies of the ground state of a nonrelativistic quantum many - body system with off - diagonal long - range order , i.e. , a `` quantum fluid , '' viewed as a quantized field , coupled to curved spacetime . as we shall see , this will naturally lead to the further question : are there @xmath2 methods to detect gravitational radiation other than the @xmath3 ones presently being used in the weber bar and ligo ( i.e. , the `` laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory '' ) @xcite@xcite@xcite ?    as i see it , the three main pillars of physics at the beginning of the 21st century are quantum mechanics , relativity , and statistical mechanics , which correspond to einstein s three papers of 1905 .",
    "there exist conceptual tensions at the intersections of these three fields of physics ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it seems worthwhile re - examining these tensions , since they may entail important experimental consequences . in this introduction ,",
    "i shall only briefly mention three conceptual tensions between these three fields : @xmath4 versus @xmath0 of physical systems , @xmath5 versus @xmath6 of probabilities in quantum and statistical mechanics ( the problem of the nature of information ) , and @xmath7 versus @xmath8 of time ( the problem of the arrows of time ) .",
    "others in this volume will discuss the second and  the third of these tensions in detail .",
    "i shall limit myself to a discussion of the first conceptual tension concerning locality versus nonlocality , mainly in the context of gr and qm .",
    "( however , in my solvay lecture @xcite , i have discussed the other two tensions in more detail .",
    "see also my rome lecture @xcite for a discussion of three different kinds of quantum nonlocalities ) .",
    "why examine conceptual tensions ?",
    "a brief answer is that they often lead to new experimental discoveries .",
    "it suffices to give just one example from late 19th and early 20th century physics : the clash between the venerable concepts of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the concept of continuity , which goes back to the greek philosopher heraclitus ( `` everything flows '' ) , clashed with the concept of discreteness , which goes back to democritus ( `` everything is composed of atoms '' ) .  eventually ,",
    "heraclitus s concept of continuity , or more specifically that of the @xmath11 , was embodied in the idea of @xmath12 in the classical field theory associated with maxwell s equations .",
    "the atomic hypothesis of democritus was eventually embodied in the kinetic theory of gases in statistical mechanics .",
    "conceptual tensions , or what wheeler calls the `` clash of ideas , '' need not lead to a complete victory of one conflicting idea over the other , so as to eliminate the opposing idea completely , as seemed to be the case in the 19th century , when newton s idea of `` corpuscles of light '' was apparently completely eliminated in favor of the wave theory of light .  rather , there may result a reconciliation of the two conflicting ideas , which  then often leads to many fruitful experimental consequences .",
    "experiments on blackbody radiation in the 19th century were exploring the intersection , or borderline , between maxwell s theory of electromagnetism and statistical mechanics , where the conceptual tension between continuity and discreteness was most acute , and eventually led to the discovery of quantum mechanics through the work of planck .",
    "the concept of @xmath10 metamorphosed into the concept of the @xmath2 .",
    "this led  in turn to the concept of _ discontinuity _ embodied in bohr s _ quantum jump _ hypothesis , which was necessitated by the indivisibility of the quantum .",
    "many experiments , such as millikan s measurements of @xmath13 , were in turn motivated by einstein s heuristic theory of the photoelectric effect based on the `` light quantum '' hypothesis .",
    "newton s idea of `` corpuscles of light '' metamorphosed into the concept of the @xmath14 .",
    "this is a striking example showing how that many fruitful experimental consequences can come out of one particular conceptual tension .    within a broader cultural context ,",
    "there have been many acute conceptual tensions between science and faith , which have lasted over many centuries .",
    "perhaps the above examples of the fruitfulness of the resolution of conceptual tensions within physics itself may serve as a parable concerning the possibility of a peaceful reconciliation of these great cultural tensions , which may eventually lead to the further growth of both science and faith .",
    "hence we should not shy away from conceptual tensions , but rather explore them with an honest , bold , and open spirit .",
    "here i shall focus my attention on some specific conceptual tensions at the intersection between qm and gr .",
    "a commonly held viewpoint within the physics community today is that the only place where conceptual tensions between these two fields can arise is at the microscopic planck length scale ( @xmath15 cm ) , where quantum fluctuations of spacetime ( `` quantum foam '' ) occur .",
    "hence manifestations of these tensions would be expected to occur only in conjunction with extremely high - energy phenomena , accessible presumably only in astrophysical settings , such as the early big bang .",
    "however , i believe that this point of view is too narrow .",
    "there exist other  conceptual tensions at macroscopic , non - planckian  distance scales ( @xmath16 cm ) , which should be accessible in low - energy laboratory experiments involving macroscopic qm phenomena .",
    "it should be kept in mind that qm not only describes @xmath17 phenomena , but also @xmath18 phenomena , such as superconductivity .",
    "specifically , i would like to point out the following  three conceptual tensions :    \\(1 ) the _ spatial nonseparability _ of physical systems due to entangled states in qm , versus the complete _ spatial separability _ of all physical systems in gr .",
    "\\(2 ) the _ equivalence principle _ of gr , versus the _ uncertainty principle _ of qm .",
    "\\(3 ) the _ mixed state _",
    "( e.g. , of an entangled bipartite system , one part of which falls into a black hole ; the other of which flies off to infinity ) in gr , versus the _ pure state _ of such a system in qm .    conceptual tension ( 3 ) concerns the problem of the natures of information and entropy in qm and gr .",
    "again , since others will discuss this tension in detail in this volume , i shall limit myself only to a discussion of the first two of these tensions .",
    "these conceptual tensions originate from the _ superposition principle _ of qm , which finds its most dramatic expression in the _ entangled state _ of two or more spatially separated particles of a single physical system , which in turn leads to einstein - podolsky - rosen  ( epr ) effects .",
    "it should be emphasized here that it is necessary to consider _ two or more _",
    "particles for observing epr phenomena , since only then does the _ configuration space _ of these particles no longer coincide with that of ordinary spacetime .  for example , consider the entangled state of two spin 1/2 particles in a `` singlet '' state initially prepared in the total spin zero state @xmath19 in which the two particles in a spontaneous decay process fly arbitrarily far away from each other into two space - like separated regions of spacetime , where measurements on spin by means of two stern - gerlach apparati are performed separately on these two particles .    as a result of the quantum entanglement arising from the @xmath20 of @xmath21 states , such as in the above singlet state suggested by bohm in connection with the epr `` paradox",
    ", '' it is in general impossible to factorize this state into products of probability amplitudes .",
    "hence it is impossible to factorize the @xmath22 probabilities in the measurements of spin of this two - particle system .",
    "this mathematical @xmath23 implies a physical @xmath24 of the system , and leads to instantaneous , space - like correlations - at - a - distance in the joint measurements of the properties ( e.g. , spin ) of discrete events , such as in the coincidence detection of `` clicks '' in geiger counters placed behind the two distant stern - gerlach apparati .",
    "bell s inequalities place an upper limit the amount of angular correlations possible for these two - particle decays , based on the @xmath25 ( and hence @xmath26 ) of the joint probabilities of spatially separated measurements in any local realistic theories , such as those envisioned by einstein .",
    "violations of bell s inequalities have been extensively experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "therefore these observations can not be explained on the basis of any _ local realistic",
    "_ world view ; however , they were predicted by qm .",
    "if we assume a @xmath27 world view , i.e. , that the `` clicks '' of the geiger counters really happened , then we must conclude that we have observed @xmath28 features of the world .",
    "therefore a fundamental _ spatial nonseparability _ of physical systems has been revealed by these bell - inequalities - violating epr experiments @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the observed space - like epr correlations occur on macroscopic , non - planckian distance scales , where the conceptual tension ( 1 ) between qm and gr becomes most acute .",
    "although some of these same issues arise in the conceptual tensions between quantum mechanics and @xmath29 relativity , there are new issues which crop up due to the long - range nature of the gravitational force , which are absent in special relativity , but present in @xmath30 relativity .",
    "the problem of quantum fields in @xmath31 spacetime can be more interesting than in @xmath32 spacetime .",
    "gravity is a _ long - range _ force .",
    "it is therefore  natural  to expect that experimental consequences of conceptual tension ( 1 )  should manifest themselves most dramatically in the  interaction of macroscopically coherent quantum matter , which exhibit _ long - range _ epr correlations , with _ long - range _ gravitational fields .",
    "in particular , the question naturally arises : how do entangled states , such as the above singlet state , interact with tidal fields , such as those in gravitational radiation ?",
    "stated more generally : how do quantum many - body systems with entangled ground states possessing off - diagonal long - range order couple to curved spacetime ?",
    "( `` off - diagonal long - range order '' ( odlro ) means that the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix in a coordinate space representation of the system are nonvanishing and possess long - range order , i.e. , macroscopic quantum phase coherence . )",
    "it is therefore natural to look to the realm of  _ macroscopic _ phenomena associated with quantum fluids , rather than phenomena at _ microscopic _ , planck length scales , in our search for these experimental consequences .",
    "already a decade or so before bell s ground - breaking work on his inequality , einstein himself was clearly worried by the radical , spatial nonseparability of physical systems in quantum mechanics .",

    "these two part - systems may have been in a state of mutual physical interaction at an earlier time .",
    "we are , however , considering them at a time when this interaction is at an end .",
    "let the entire system be completely described in the quantum mechanical sense by a @xmath36-function @xmath37 of the coordinates @xmath38 , ... and @xmath39 , ... of the two part - systems ( @xmath37 can not be represented as a product of the form @xmath40 but only as a sum of such products [ _ i.e. , as an entangled state _ ] ) .  at timetlet",

    "`` there seems to me no doubt that those physicists who regard the descriptive methods of quantum mechanics as definitive in principle would react to this line of thought in the following way : they would drop the requirement for _ the independent existence of the physical reality present in different parts of space _ ; they would be justified in pointing out that the quantum theory nowhere makes explicit use of this requirement .

    "however , i should hasten to add immediately that the battle - tested concept of _ field _ has of course been extremely fruitful not only at the classical but also at the quantum level .",
    "relativistic quantum field theories have been very well validated , at least in an approximate , correspondence - principle sense in which spacetime itself is treated classically , i.e. , as being describable by a rigidly flat , minkowskian metric , which has no  possibility of any quantum dynamics .",
    "there have been tremendous successes of quantum electrodynamics and electroweak gauge field theory ( and , to a lesser extent , quantum chromodynamics ) in passing all known high - energy experimental tests .",
    "thus the conceptual tension between @xmath43 ( used in the concept of the spacetime @xmath11 ) and @xmath44 ( used in the concept of _ quantized excitations _ of a field in classical spacetime ) seems to have been successfully reconciled in these relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of a satisfactory relativistic treatment of quantum measurement within these theories remains an open one @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above discussion , a more specific question arises : is there any difference between classical and quantum matter when it is embedded in curved spacetime , for instance , in the @xmath45 response to the gravitational tidal field of the earth of a @xmath3 liquid drop , as compared to that of a @xmath2 one , such as a liquid drop of superfluid helium ?  in order to answer this question , consider a gedanken experiment to observe the shape of a freely floating liquid drop placed at the center of the space station sketched in figure 2 .    at first glance ,",
    "the answer to this question would seem to be `` no , '' since the equivalence principle would seem to imply that all freely falling bodies , whether classical or quantum , must respond to gravitation , e.g. , earth s gravity , in a _ mass - independent _ , or more generally , in a _ composition - independent _ way .",
    "thus whether the internal dynamics of the particles composing the liquid drop obeys classical mechanics or quantum mechanics would seem to make no difference in the response of this body to gravity .  just as in the case of the response of the tides of the earth",
    "s oceans to the moon s gravity , the shape of the surface of a liquid of any mass or composition would be determined by the equipotential surfaces of the total gravitational field , and should be independent of the mass or composition of the liquid , provided that the fluid particles can move @xmath46 inside the fluid , and provided that the surface tension of the liquid can be neglected .    however , one must carefully distinguish between the response of the _ center of mass _ of the liquid drop inside the space station to earth s gravity , and the response of the _ relative motions _ of particles within the drop to earth s tidal gravitational field .",
    "whereas the former clearly obeys the mass- and composition - independence of the equivalence principle , one must examine the latter with more care .",
    "first , one must define what one means by `` classical '' and `` quantum '' bodies .  by a `` classical body",
    ", '' we shall mean here a body whose particles have undergone @xmath47 in the sense of zurek @xcite , so that no macroscopic , schrdinger - cat - like states for  widely spatially separated subsystems ( i.e. , the fluid elements inside the classical liquid drop ) can survive the rapid decoherence arising from the environment .",
    "this is true for the vast majority of bodies typically encountered in the laboratory .",
    "it is the rapid decoherence of the spatially separated subsystems of a classical body that makes the _ spatial separability _ of a system into its parts , and hence @xmath1 , a valid concept .",
    "nevertheless , there exist exceptions .",
    "for example , a macroscopically coherent quantum system , e.g. , a quantum fluid such as the electron pairs inside a superconductor , usually possesses an energy gap which separates the ground state of the system from all possible excited states of the system .",
    "cooper pairs of electrons in a bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) ground state are in the entangled spin singlet states given by eq.([bohm singlet ] ) . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "such a quantum fluid develops a macroscopic quantum coherence , as is manifested by a macroscopic quantum phase which becomes well defined at each point inside the fluid .",
    "the resulting macroscopic wavefunction must remain single valued , in spite of small perturbations , such as those due to weak external fields .",
    "the energy gap , such the bcs gap , protects spatially separated , but entangled , particles within the body , such as the electrons which members of cooper pairs inside a superconductor , against decoherence .",
    "therefore , these quantum fluids are _ protectively entangled _",
    ", in the sense that the existence of some sort of energy gap separates the nondegenerate ground state of the system from all excited states , and hence prevents any rapid decoherence due to the environment .",
    "under these circumstances , the macroscopically entangled ground state of a quantum fluid , becomes a meaningful @xmath48 concept , and the notion of @xmath0 , that is , the _ spatial nonseparability _ of a system into its parts , enters in an intrinsic way into the problem of the interaction of matter with gravitational fields .",
    "for example , imagine a liquid drop consisting of superfluid helium at zero kelvin , which is in a pure quantum state , floating at the center of the space station , as pictured in figure 3 .",
    "although the microscopic many - body problem for this superfluid has not been completely solved , there exist a successful macroscopic , phenomenological description based on the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xmath49where @xmath50 is the macroscopic complex order parameter , and the potential @xmath51 describes earth s gravity ( including its tidal gravitational potential , but neglecting for the moment the frame - dragging term coupled to superfluid currents ) , along with the surface tension effects which enters into the determination of the free boundary of the liquid drop .",
    "macroscopic quantum entanglement is contained in the nonlinear term @xmath52 , which arises microscopically from atom - atom @xmath53-wave scattering events , just as in the case of the recently observed atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "( the parameter @xmath54 is directly proportional to the @xmath53-wave scattering length @xmath55 ; the interaction between two atoms in a individual scattering event entangles the two scattering atoms together , so that a measurement of the momentum of one atom immediately determines the momentum of the other atom which participated in the scattering event . )  as in the case of the becs , where this equation has been successfully applied to predict many observed phenomena , the physical meaning of @xmath50 is that it is the condensate wavefunction .",
    "there should exist near the inside surface  of the superfluid liquid drop , closed trajectories for helium atom wave packets propagating at grazing incidence , which , in the correspondence - principle limit , should lead to the atomic analog of the `` whispering gallery modes '' of light , such as those observed inside microspheres immersed in superfluid helium @xcite@xcite . in the case of light",
    ", these modes can possess extremely high @xmath56s ( of the order of @xmath57 ) , so that the quadrupolar distortion from a spherical shape due to tidal forces can thereby be very sensitively measured optically ( the degeneracy of these modes has been observed to be split by nontidal quadrupolar distortions @xcite ) .",
    "the atomic wave packets propagating at grazing incidence near the surface are actually those of individual helium atoms dressed by the collective excitations of the superfluid , such as phonons , rotons , and ripplons @xcite .",
    "application of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule to the closed trajectories which correspond to the whispering gallery modes for atoms should lead to a @xmath58 of the sizes and shapes of the superfluid drop . for a classical liquid drop , no such quantization occurs because of the decoherence of an atom after it has propagated around these large , polygonal closed trajectories .",
    "hence there should exist a @xmath59 between classical and quantum matter in their respective responses to gravitational tidal fields . at a fundamental level , this difference arises from the quantum phase shift which is observable in the shift of the interference fringe pattern that results from an atom travelling coherently along two nearby , but intersecting , geodesics in the presence of spacetime curvature @xcite .",
    "another difference between a classical and a quantum liquid drop is the possibility of the presence of @xmath60 vortices in the latter , along with their associated persistent , macroscopic current flows .",
    "these quantum flows possess quantized vorticities of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mass of the superfluid atom .",
    "the question naturally arises : how do two such vortices placed symmetrically around the center of mass of a superfluid liquid drop react to the presence of tidal forces associated with gravitational radiation ?",
    "i suspect that these vortices will move _ at right angles _ in response to these forces in accordance with the magnus force law , which is a lorentz - like force law for vortex motion in superfluids .",
    "the perpendicularity of this kind of motion is manifestly different from that a test particle of a classical `` perfect '' fluid .",
    "such @xmath63 in the linear response between classical and quantum matter in the induced quadrupole moment @xmath64 of the liquid drop can be characterized by a linear equation relating @xmath64 to the metric deviations from flat spacetime @xmath65 by means of a phenomenological susceptibility tensor @xmath66 , viz .",
    ", @xmath67where @xmath68 are spatial indices ( repeated indices are summed ) .",
    "the susceptibility tensor @xmath69 should in principle be calculable from the many - body current - current correlation function in the linear - response theory of superfluid helium @xcite .    here ,",
    "however , i shall limit myself only to some general remarks concerning @xmath70 based on the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "since the response of the liquid drop to weak tidal gravitational fields is @xmath45 and @xmath71 , it follows that@xmath72@xmath73where @xmath74 denotes cauchy s principal value . from the first of these relations",
    ", there follows the zero - frequency sum rule@xmath75this equation tells us that @xmath76 there should exist a difference in the linear response between classical and quantum matter to tidal fields at dc ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) in the quadrupolar shape of the liquid drop , @xmath78 there must also exist a difference in the rate of absorption or emission of gravitational radiation due to the imaginary part of the susceptibility @xmath79 between classical and quantum matter .",
    "the purpose here is not to calculate how big this difference is , but merely to point out that such a difference exists .",
    "the above considerations also apply equally well to an atomic bec , indeed , to any quantum fluid , in its linear response to tidal fields .",
    "at this point , i would like to return to the more general question : where to look for experimental consequences of conceptual tension ( 1 ) ?",
    "the above discussion suggests the following answer : look at _ macroscopically entangled _ , and thus _ radically delocalized _ , quantum states encountered , for example , in superconductors , superfluids , atomic becs , and quantum hall fluids , i.e. , in what i shall henceforth call `` quantum fluids . ''",
    "again it should be stressed that since gravity is a _ long - range _ force , it should be possible to perform _ low - energy _ experiments to probe the interaction between gravity and these kinds of quantum matter on large , non - planckian distance scales , without the necessity of performing high - energy experiments , as is required for probing the short - range weak and strong forces on very short distance scales .",
    "the quantum many - body problem , even in its nonrelativistic limit , may lead to nontrivial interactions with weak , long - range gravitational fields , as the above example suggests .",
    "one is thereby  strongly motivated to study the interaction of these quantum fluids with weak gravity , in particular , with gravitational radiation .",
    "one manifestation of this conceptual tension is that the way one views a quantum fluid in qm is conceptually radically different from the way that one views a perfect fluid in gr , where only the @xmath80 properties of the fluid , which can conceptually always be spatially separated into independent , infinitesimal fluid elements , are to be considered .",
    "for example , interstellar dust particles can be thought of as being a perfect fluid in gr , provided that we can neglect all interactions between such particles @xcite .  at a fundamental level ,",
    "the spatial separability of the perfect fluid in gr arises from the rapid decoherence of quantum superposition states ( i.e. , schrdinger cat - like states ) of various interstellar dust particles at widely separated spatial positions within a dust cloud , due to interactions with the environment .",
    "hence the notion of @xmath4 is valid here .",
    "the response of these dust particles in the resulting @xmath3 many - body system to a gravitational wave passing over it , is characterized by the local , classical , free - fall motion of each individual dust particle .",
    "in contrast to the classical case , due to their radical delocalization , particles in a macroscopically coherent quantum many - body system , i.e. , a quantum fluid , are entangled with each other in such a way that there arises an unusual `` quantum rigidity '' of the system , closely associated with what london called `` the rigidity of the macroscopic wavefunction '' @xcite .",
    "one example of such a rigid quantum fluid is the `` incompressible quantum fluid '' in both the integer and the fractional quantum hall effects @xcite .",
    "this rigidity arises from the fact that there exists an energy gap ( for example , the quantum hall gap ) which separates the ground state from all the low - lying excitations of the system .",
    "this gap , as pointed out above , also serves to protect the quantum entanglement present in the ground state from decoherence due to the environment , provided that the temperature of these quantum systems is sufficiently low .",
    "thus these quantum fluids exhibit a kind of `` gap - protected quantum entanglement . ''",
    "furthermore , the gap leads to an evolution in accordance with the quantum adiabatic theorem : the system stays adiabatically in a rigidly unaltered ground state , which leads in first - order perturbation theory to quantum diamagnetic effects .",
    "examples of consequences of this `` rigidity of the wavefunction '' are the meissner effect in the case of superconductors , in which the magnetic field is expelled from their interiors , and the chern - simons effect in the quantum hall fluid , in which the photon acquires a mass inside the fluid .",
    "the unusual states of matter in these quantum fluids usually possess _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ , in which the ground state , or the `` vacuum '' state , of the quantum many - body system breaks the symmetry present in the free energy of the system .  the physical vacuum , which is in an intrinsically nonlocal ground state of relativistic quantum field theories , possesses certain similarities to the ground state of a superconductor , for example .",
    "weinberg has argued that in superconductivity , the spontaneous symmetry breaking process results in a broken @xmath81 invariance weinberg(nambu ) , an idea which traces back to the early work of nambu nambu .",
    "the meissner effect in a superconductor is closely analogous to the higgs mechanism of high - energy physics , in which the physical vacuum also spontaneously breaks local gauge invariance , and can also be viewed as forming a condensate which possesses a single - valued complex order parameter with a well - defined local phase . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the appearance of the london penetration depth for a superconductor is analogous in an inverse manner to the appearance of a mass for a gauge boson , such as that of the @xmath82 or @xmath83 boson .",
    "thus , the photon , viewed as a gauge boson , acquires a mass inside the superconductor , such that its compton wavelength becomes the london penetration depth .",
    "similar considerations apply to the effect of the chern - simons term in the quantum hall fluid .     closely related to this spontaneous symmetry breaking process",
    "is the appearance of yang s off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) of the reduced density matrix in the coordinate - space representation for most of these macroscopically coherent quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , there seems to be no limit on how far apart cooper pairs can be inside a single superconductor before they lose their quantum coherence .",
    "odlro and spontaneous symmetry breaking are both purely quantum concepts with no classical analogs .     within a quantum fluid",
    ", there should arise both the phenomenon of instantaneous epr correlations - at - a - distance , and the phenomenon of london s `` rigidity of the wavefunction , '' i.e. , a meissner - like response to radiation fields .",
    "both phenomena involve at the microscopic level @xmath84 of entangled particles with an external environment , either through local @xmath85 , such as in bell - type measurements , or through local @xmath86 , such as those arising from radiation fields interacting locally with these particles .",
    "although at first sight the notion of `` infinite quantum rigidity '' would seem to imply infinite velocities , and hence would seem to violate relativity , there are in fact no violations of relativistic causality here , since the instantaneous epr @xmath87-at - a - distance ( as seen by an observer in the center - of - mass frame ) are not instantaneous @xmath88-at - a - distance , which would instantaneously connect causes to effects chiaoheisenberg .",
    "also , experiments have verified the existence of superluminal wave packet propagations , i.e. , faster - than-@xmath89 , infinite , and even negative group velocities , for finite - bandwidth , analytic wave packets in the excitations of a wide range of physical systems @xcite@xcite .",
    "an analytic function , e.g. , a gaussian wave packet , contains sufficient information in its early tail such that a causal medium can , during its propagation , reconstruct the entire wave packet with a superluminal pulse advancement , and with little distortion .",
    "relativistic causality forbids  only the @xmath90 velocity , i.e. , the velocity of @xmath91 which connect causes to their effects , from exceeding the speed of light @xmath89 , but does not forbid a wave packet s @xmath92 velocity from being superluminal .",
    "one example is the observed superluminal tunneling of single - photon wave packets @xcite .",
    "thus the notion of `` infinite quantum rigidity , '' although counterintuitive , does not in fact violate relativistic causality .",
    "concerning conceptual tension ( 2 ) , the equivalence principle is formulated at its outset using the concept of `` trajectory , '' or equivalently , `` geodesic . ''  by contrast , bohr has taught us that the very @xmath93 of trajectory must be abandoned at fundamental level , because of the uncertainty principle .",
    "thus the equivalence and the uncertainty principles are in a fundamental conceptual tension .  the equivalence principle is based on the notion of locality , since it requires that the region of space , inside which two trajectories of two nearby freely - falling objects of different masses , compositions , or thermodynamic states , are to be compared , go to zero volume , before the principle becomes exact .",
    "this limiting procedure is in a conceptual tension with the uncertainty principle , since taking the limit of the volume of space going to zero , within which these objects are to be measured , makes their momenta infinitely uncertain .",
    "however , whenever the correspondence principle holds , the _ center of mass _ of a quantum wavepacket ( for a single particle or for an entire quantum object ) moves according to ehrenfest s theorem along a classical trajectory , and @xmath94 it is possible to reconcile these two principles .",
    "davies @xcite  has come up with a simple example of a quantum violation of the equivalence principle @xcite@xciteherdegen : consider two perfectly elastic balls , e.g. , one made out of rubber , and one made out of steel , bouncing against a perfectly elastic table .",
    "if we drop the two balls from the same height above the table , their classical trajectories , and hence their classical periods of oscillation will be identical , and independent of the mass or composition of the balls .",
    "this is a consequence of the equivalence principle .",
    "however , quantum mechanically , there will be the phenomenon of tunneling , in which the two balls can penetrate into the classically forbidden region @xmath95 their turning points .  the extra time spent by the balls in the classically forbidden region due to tunneling",
    "will depend on their mass ( and thus on their composition ) .  thus there will in principle",
    "be _ mass - dependent _ quantum corrections of the classical periods of the bouncing motion of these balls , which will lead to quantum violations of the equivalence principle",
    ".     there might exist macroscopic situations in which ehrenfest s form of the correspondence principle fails .",
    "imagine that one is inside a macroscopic quantum fluid , such as a big piece of superconconductor .",
    "even in the limit of a very large size and a very large number of particles inside this object ( i.e. , in the thermodynamic limit ) , there exists no correspondence - principle limit in which classical trajectories or geodesics for the _ relative motion _ of electrons which are members of cooper pairs in bohm singlet states within the superconductor , make any sense .",
    "this is due to the superposition principle and the entanglement of a macroscopic number of identical particles inside these quantum fluids .",
    "nevertheless , the _ motion of the center of mass _ of the superconductor may obey perfectly the equivalence principle , and may therefore be conceptualized in terms of a geodesic .",
    "can the quantum rigidity arising from the energy gap of a quantum fluid circumvent the problem of the tiny rigidity of classical matter , such as that of the normal metals used in weber bars , in their feeble responses to gravitational radiation ?",
    "one consequence of the tiny rigidity of classical matter is the fact that the speed of sound in a weber bar is typically five orders of magnitude less than the speed of light .  in order to transfer energy coherently from a gravitational wave by classical means , for example , by acoustical modes inside the bar  to some local detector ,",
    "e.g. , a piezoelectric crystal glued to the middle of the bar , the length scale of the weber bar @xmath96 is limited to a distance scale on the order of the speed of sound times the period of the gravitational wave , i.e. , an acoustical wavelength @xmath97 , which is typically five orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational radiation wavelength @xmath98 to be detected .",
    "this makes the weber bar , which is thereby limited in its length to @xmath99 , much too short an antenna to couple efficiently to free space .     however , rigid quantum objects , such as a two - dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic field which exhibits the quantum hall effect , in what laughlin has called an `` incompressible quantum fluid '' @xcite , are not limited by these classical considerations , but can have macroscopic quantum phase coherence on a length scale @xmath96 on the same order as ( or even much greater than ) the gravitational radiation wavelength @xmath98 . since the radiation efficiency of a quadrupole antenna scales as the length of the antenna @xmath96 to the fourth power when @xmath100 , such quantum antennas should be much more efficient in coupling to free space than classical ones like the weber bar by at least a factor of @xmath101 .",
    "weinberg  gives a measure of the radiative coupling efficiency @xmath102 of a weber bar of mass @xmath103 , length @xmath96 , and velocity of sound @xmath104 , in terms of a branching ratio for the emission of gravitational radiation by the weber bar , relative to the emission of heat , i.e. , the ratio of the @xmath105 of emission of gravitational radiation @xmath106 relative to the @xmath107 of the decay of the acoustical oscillations into heat @xmath108 , which is given by @xcite@xmath109where @xmath110 is newton s constant .",
    "the quartic power dependence of the efficiency @xmath102  on the velocity of sound @xmath104 arises from the quartic dependence of the coupling efficiency to free space of a quadrupole antenna upon its length @xmath96 , when @xmath100 .     the long - range quantum phase coherence of a quantum fluid allows the typical size @xmath96 of a quantum antenna to be comparable to the wavelength @xmath98 .",
    "thus the phase rigidity of the quantum fluid allows us in principle to replace the velocity of sound @xmath104 by the speed of light @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , quantum fluids can be more efficient than weber bars , based on the @xmath111 factor alone , by twenty orders of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath112hence quantum fluids could be much more efficient receivers of this radiation than weber bars for detecting astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "this has previously been suggested to be the case for superfluids and superconductors @xcite@xcite .",
    "another important property of quantum fluids lies in the fact that they can possess an extremely low dissipation coefficient @xmath113 , as can be inferred , for example , by the existence of persistent currents in superfluids that can last for indefinitely long periods of time .",
    "thus the impedance matching of the quantum antenna to free space @xcite , or equivalently , the branching ratio of energy emitted into the gravitational radiation channel rather than into the heat channel , can be much larger than that calculated above for the classical weber bar .",
    "the electron , which possesses charge @xmath114 , rest mass @xmath62 , and spin @xmath115 , obeys the dirac equation .",
    "the nonrelativistic , interacting , fermionic many - body system , such as that in the quantum hall fluid , should obey the minimal - coupling rule which originates from the covariant - derivative coupling of the dirac electron to curved spacetime , viz . , @xcite@xcite @xmath116where @xmath117 is the electron s four - momentum , @xmath118 is the electromagnetic four - potential , @xmath119 are the dirac @xmath120 matrices in curved spacetime with tetrad ( or vierbein ) @xmath121 indices , and @xmath122 are the components of the spin connection@xmath123where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are tetrad four - vectors , which are sets of four orthogonal unit vectors of spacetime , such as those corresponding to a local inertial frame .",
    "spacetime curvature directly affects the phase of the wavefunction , leading to fringe shifts of quantum - mechanical interference patterns within atomic interferometers @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the vector potential @xmath118 will also lead to a quantum interference effect , in which the gauge - invariant aharonov - bohm phase becomes observable .",
    "similarly , the spin connection @xmath126 , in its abelian holonomy , should also lead to a quantum interference effect , in which the gauge - invariant berry phase @xcite becomes observable .",
    "the following berry phase picture of a spin coupled to curved spacetime leads to an intuitive way of understanding why there could exist a coupling between a classical gr wave and a classical em wave mediated by a quantum fluid with charge and spin , such as the quantum hall fluid .    due to its gyroscopic nature , the spin vector of an electron undergoes _ parallel transport _ during the passage of a gr wave .",
    "the spin of the electron is constrained to lie inside the space - like submanifold of curved spacetime .",
    "this is due to the fact that we can always transform to a co - moving frame , such that the electron is at rest at the origin of this frame . in this frame",
    ", the spin of the electron must be purely a space - like vector with no time - like component .",
    "this imposes an important @xmath127 on the motion of the electron s spin , such that whenever the space - like submanifold of spacetime is disturbed by the passage of a gravitational wave , the spin must remain at all times @xmath128 to the local time axis .",
    "if the spin vector is constrained to follow a conical trajectory during the passage of the gravitational wave , the electron picks up a berry phase proportional to the solid angle subtended by this conical trajectory after one period of the gr wave .    in a manner similar to the persistent currents induced by the berry phase in systems with odlro @xcite",
    ", such a berry phase induces an electrical current in the quantum hall fluid , which is in a macroscopically coherent ground state @xcite .",
    "this macroscopic current generates an em wave .",
    "thus a gr wave can be converted into an em wave . by reciprocity ,",
    "the time - reversed process of the conversion from an em wave to a gr wave must also be possible .    in the nonrelativistic limit , the four - component dirac spinor is reduced to a two - component spinor .",
    "while the precise form of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian is not known for the many - body system in a weakly curved spacetime consisting of electrons in a strong magnetic field , i conjecture that it will have the form@xmath129where @xmath130 is a spatial index , @xmath131 are spatial tetrad incides , @xmath132 is a two - by - two matrix - valued tensor representing the spin @xcite , and @xmath133 is the nonrelativistic form of @xmath134",

    "the potential energy @xmath136 includes the coulomb interactions between the electrons in the quantum hall fluid .",
    "this nonrelativistic hamiltonian has the form@xmath137where the particle index , the spin , and the tetrad indices have all been suppressed . upon expanding the square",

    "@xmath142 represent em and gr radiation , respectively .    in first - order perturbation theory ,",
    "the quantum adiabatic theorem predicts that there will arise the cross - coupling energy between the two radiation fields mediated by the quantum fluid @xmath143where @xmath144 is the unperturbed ground state of the system . for the adiabatic theorem to hold",
    ", there must exist an energy gap @xmath145 ( e.g. , the quantum hall energy gap ) separating the ground state from all excited states , in conjunction with the approximation that the time variation of the radiation fields must be slow compared to the gap time @xmath146 .",
    "this suggests that under these conditions , there might exist an interconversion process between these two kinds of classical radiation fields mediated by this quantum fluid , as indicated in figure 4 .",
    "the question immediately arises : em radiation is fundamentally a spin 1 ( photon ) field , but gr radiation is fundamentally a spin 2 ( graviton ) field .",
    "how is it possible to convert one kind of radiation into the other , and not violate the conservation of angular momentum ?",
    "the answer : the em wave converts to the gr wave _ through a medium_. here specifically , the medium of conversion consists of a strong dc magnetic field applied to a system of electrons .",
    "this system possesses an axis of symmetry pointing along the magnetic field direction , and therefore transforms like a spin 1 object .",
    "when coupled to a spin 1 ( circularly polarized ) em radiation field , the total system can in principle produce a spin 2 ( circularly polarized ) gr radiation field , by the addition of angular momentum . however , it remains an open question as to how strong this interconversion process is between em and gr radiation .",
    "most importantly , the size of the conversion efficiency of this transduction process needs to be determined by experiment .",
    "we can see more clearly the physical significance of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath147 once we convert it into second quantized form and express it in terms of the creation and annihilation operators for the positive frequency parts of the  two kinds of radiation fields , as in the theory of quantum optics , so that in the rotating - wave approximation@xmath148where the annihilation operator @xmath55 and the creation operator @xmath149 of the single classical mode of the plane - wave em radiation field corresponding the @xmath139 term , obey the commutation relation @xmath150=1 $ ] , and where the annihilation operator @xmath151 and the creation operator @xmath152 of the single classical mode of the plane - wave gr radiation field corresponding to the @xmath153 term , obey the commutation relation @xmath154=1 $ ] .",
    "( this represents a crude , first attempt at quantizing the gravitational field , which applies only in the case of weak , linearized gravity . )",
    "the first term @xmath155 then corresponds to the process in which a graviton is annihilated and a photon is created inside the quantum fluid , and similarly the second term @xmath156 corresponds to the reciprocal process , in which a photon is annihilated and a graviton is created inside the quantum fluid .",
    "let us return once again to the question of whether there exists @xmath157 difference in the response of quantum fluids to tidal fields in gravitational radiation , and the response of classical matter , such as the lattice of ions in a superconductor , for example , to such fields .",
    "the essential difference between quantum fluids and classical matter is the presence or absence of macroscopic quantum phase coherence . in quantum matter , there exist quantum interference effects , whereas in classical matter , such as in the lattice of ions of a superconductor , decoherence arising from the environment destroys any such interference . as argued earlier in section 3 , the response of quantum fluids and of classical matter to these fields will therefore differ from each other .    in the case of superconductors ,",
    "cooper pairs of electrons possess a macroscopic phase coherence , which can lead to an aharonov - bohm - type interference absent in the ionic lattice .",
    "similarly , in the quantum hall fluid , the electrons will also possess macroscopic phase coherence girvin , which can lead to berry - phase - type interference absent in the lattice .",
    "furthermore , there exist ferromagnetic superfluids with intrinsic spin , in which an ionic lattice is completely absent , such as in spin - polarized atomic becs @xcite and in superfluid helium 3 @xcite . in such ferromagnetic quantum fluids , there exists no ionic lattice to give rise to any classical response which could prevent a quantum response to tidal gravitational radiation fields .",
    "the berry - phase - induced response of the ferromagnetic superfluid arises from the spin connection ( see the above minimal - coupling rule , which can be generalized from an electron spin to a nuclear spin coupled to the curved spacetime associated with gravitational radiation ) , and leads to a purely quantum response to this radiation .",
    "the berry phase induces time - varying macroscopic quantum flows in this ferromagnetic odlro system @xcite , which transports time - varying orientations of the nuclear magnetic moments .",
    "this ferromagnetic superfluid can therefore also in principle convert gravitational into electromagnetic radiation , and vice versa , in a manner similar to the case discussed above for the ferromagnetic quantum hall fluid .",
    "thus we expect there to exist differences between classical and quantum fluids in their respective linear responses to weak external perturbations associated with gravitational radiation .",
    "like superfluids , the quantum hall fluid is an example of a quantum fluid which differs from a classical fluid in its current - current correlation function @xcite in the presence of gr waves . in particular",
    ", gr waves can induce a transition of the quantum hall fluid out of its ground state @xmath158 by exciting a quantized , collective excitation across the quantum hall energy gap .",
    "this collective excitation would involve the correlated motions of a macroscopic number of electrons in this coherent quantum system .",
    "hence the quantum hall fluid is effectively incompressible and dissipationless , and is thus a good candidate for a quantum antenna .",
    "there exist other situations in which a minimal - coupling rule similar to the one above , arises for @xmath159 quantum fields in curved spacetime .",
    "dewitt @xcite suggested  in 1966 such a coupling in the case of superconductors @xcite .",
    "speliotopoulos @xcite noted in 1995 that a cross - coupling term of the form @xmath160 arose in the long - wavelength limit of a certain quantum hamiltonian derived from the geodesic deviation equations of motion using the transverse - traceless gauge for gr waves .",
    "speliotopoulos and i have been working on the problem of the coupling of a scalar quantum field to curved spacetime in a general laboratory frame , which avoids the use of the long - wavelength approximation @xcite . in general relativity , there exists in general no global time coordinate that can apply throughout a large system , since for nonstationary metrics , such as those associated with gravitational radiation , the local time axis varies from place to place in the system .",
    "it is therefore necessary to set up operationally a general laboratory frame by which an observer can measure the motion of slowly moving test particles in the presence of weak , time - varying gravitational radiation fields .    for either a classical or quantum test particle",
    ", the result is that its mass @xmath62 should enter into the hamiltonian through the replacement of @xmath161 by @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the small , local tidal velocity field induced by gravitational radiation on a test particle located at @xmath164 relative to the observer at the origin ( i.e. , the center of mass ) of this frame , where , for the small deviations @xmath165 of the metric from that of flat spacetime , @xmath166 due to the quadrupolar nature of gravitational tidal fields , the velocity field @xmath163 for a plane wave grows linearly in magnitude with the distance of the test particle from the center of mass , as seen by the observer located at the center of mass of the system .",
    "therefore , in order to recover the standard result of classical gr that only @xmath167 gravitational fields enter into the coupling of radiation and matter , one expects in general that a new characteristic length scale @xmath96 corresponding to the typical size of the distance @xmath164 separating the test particle from the observer , must enter into the determination of the coupling constant between radiation and matter .",
    "for example , @xmath96 can be the typical size of the detection apparatus ( e.g. , the length of the arms of the michelson interferometer used in ligo ) , or of the transverse gaussian wave packet size of the gravitational radiation , so that the coupling constant associated with the feynman vertex for a graviton - particle interaction becomes proportional to the @xmath168 quantity @xmath169 , instead of an @xmath170 quantity involving only @xmath171 .    for the case of superconductors , treating cooper pairs of electrons as bosons",
    ", we would expect the above arguments would carry over with the charge @xmath114 replaced by @xmath172 and the mass @xmath62 replaced by @xmath173 . for quantum fluids which possess an order parameter @xmath50 obeying the ginzburg - landau equation , the above minimal - coupling rule suggests that this equation be generalized as follows:@xmath174 where @xmath175 .",
    "returning to the general problem of quantum fields embedded in curved spacetime , we recall that the ground state of a superconductor , which possesses spontaneous symmetry breaking , and therefore odlro , is very similar to that of the physical vacuum , which is believed also to possess spontanous symmetry breaking through the higgs mechanism . in this sense , therefore , the vacuum is `` superconducting .

    "the question thus arises : how does a ground or `` vacuum '' state of a superconductor , and other quantum fluids viewed as ground states of nonrelativistic quantum field theories with odlro , interact with dynamically changing spacetimes , e.g. , a gr wave ?",
    "we believe that this question needs both theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "in particular , motivated by the discussion in the previous section , we suspect that there might exist superconductors , viewed as quantum fluids , which are transducers between em and gr waves based on the cross - coupling hamiltonian @xmath176 @xmath177 .",

    "one might expect a transducer power conversion efficiency of @xmath185 based on a naive classical picture in which each individual electron follows a deterministic , newtonian trajectory .",
    "if this classical picture had been correct , there would have been no hope of actually observing this conversion process , based on the limited sensitivity of existing experimental techniques such as those described in @xcite .",

    ", there may exist quantum many - body enhancements to this classical conversion efficiency .",
    "in addition to these enhancements , there must exist additional enhancements due to the fact that the intensive coupling constant @xmath171 of the feynman graviton - matter vertex should be replaced by the extensive coupling constant @xmath169 , in order to account correctly for the @xmath167 nature of gr waves @xcite .",
