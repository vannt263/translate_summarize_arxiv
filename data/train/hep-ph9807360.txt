    "the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment @xcite is measuring the rate @xmath5 of electrons produced by @xmath4b solar neutrinos @xcite through the scattering process @xmath6 in a fiducial mass of 22.5 kton of water and above a threshold @xmath7 for the measured electron kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "there are good prospects for lowering @xmath8 to @xmath9 mev in the near future @xcite .    in the presence of flavor oscillations ,",
    "as suggested by various solutions to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , also muon and tau neutrinos can contribute to @xmath5 through neutral current interactions @xmath10 although it is not possible to separate the contribution of reaction  ( [ numutau ] ) from reaction  ( [ nue ] ) within the sk experiment itself .    in this work",
    "we show how to separate in a model independent way the @xmath1 and @xmath2 event rates in the sk experiment , by means of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite measurement of the total electron rate ( @xmath11 ) from the charged current process @xmath12 provided that the corresponding electron energy threshold @xmath13 is chosen appropriately .",
    "no other experimental information or theoretical assumption is required .",
    "more precisely , we show that the response functions of the sk and sno detectors happen to be approximately equal for suitably chosen values of @xmath8 and @xmath13 , within errors much smaller than the uncertainties associated to the cross section for reaction  ( [ nud ] ) .",
    "this lucky circumstance makes our approach truly model independent : no prior assumption is required on the absolute @xmath4b neutrino flux @xmath14 , on the energy ( in)dependence of the oscillation probability , or on the presence of possible sterile neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , if only active neutrinos are considered , the absolute value of @xmath14 can also be determined from the same data ( @xmath5 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we set the notation . in section",
    "iii we study the response functions of sk and sno and show that they can be equalized to a good approximation by tuning the energy thresholds . in section",
    "iv we work out the consequences of this empirical equality .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "v.    we conclude this section by estimating the rate of solar - neutrino induced electrons @xmath5 actually occurring in the sk detector .",
    "the rate of _ observed _ events above @xmath15 mev is @xmath16 events / kton / day @xcite .",
    "however , this number is expected to be smaller than the actual rate of @xmath17 interactions , due to inefficiencies in the data reduction chain .",
    "the total signal efficiency @xmath18 appears to be dominated by three cuts : ( 1 ) noise cut , @xmath19 @xcite ; ( 2 ) spallation cut , @xmath20 @xcite ; and gamma ray cut , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "then we get @xmath22 , in agreement with the signal efficiency quoted in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we estimate the total number of @xmath17 interactions ( detected and undetected ) occurring in sk as : @xmath23 analogously , and by cutting the electron energy spectrum @xcite at @xmath24 mev , we obtain @xmath25 our estimates ( [ r1],[r2 ] ) are tentative and will be used only for some numerical examples , the main idea of this work being independent on the specific value of @xmath5 .",
    "it is understood that , when the sno data will become available and will be compared with the sk data , one should use both rates @xmath5 and @xmath11 as corrected for efficiency effects by the experimental collaborations themselves .",
    "we denote the absolute flux of @xmath4b solar neutrinos by @xmath14 and its energy spectrum @xcite by @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 being the neutrino energy .",
    "we do not assume any prior estimate of @xmath14 from standard solar models @xcite in this work .    in the presence of neutrino oscillations ,",
    "we denote the @xmath1 oscillation probabilities into other states ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or sterile @xmath31 ) as @xmath32 subject to the unitarity constraint @xmath33 .",
    "no assumption is made on the functional form of @xmath34 .",
    "the neutrino cross sections for the reactions ( [ nue ] ) , ( [ numutau ] ) , and ( [ nud ] ) are indicated as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "it is understood that each cross section @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is corrected for the energy threshold and resolution effects appropriate to the the sk and sno detectors , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the _ true _ and _ measured _ electron kinetic energies , respectively , @xmath43 is the energy threshold ( equal to @xmath8 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 and to @xmath13 for @xmath37 ) , and @xmath13 are _ data analysis _ thresholds that can be chosen freely , provided that they are greater than the _ detector trigger _ thresholds . ]",
    "@xmath44 is the differential cross section , and @xmath45 is the energy resolution function @xmath46 with a one - sigma width @xmath47 scaling as @xmath48 @xmath49 being equal to 1.5 mev for sk @xcite and to 1.4 mev for sno @xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections are taken from @xcite for reactions  ( [ nue],[numutau ] ) and from @xcite for reaction  ( [ nud ] ) .    in the calculation of event rates , the cross sections @xmath38",
    "always appear in the combination @xmath50 .",
    "it is then useful to define two quantities ( related to @xmath50 ) that characterize completely the detector response to a given neutrino reaction , namely , the energy averaged cross section @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the normalized response function @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "we remark that both functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 do not depend on the value of @xmath14 nor on @xmath34 ; they are completely determined from detector properties , cross sections and @xmath4b decay spectrum .    given the above definitions , the rate of electrons produced per unit time and target electron in super - kamiokande through reactions ( [ nue ] ) and ( [ numutau ] ) can be generally written as @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , having in mind that the sk detector does not measure @xmath60 and @xmath61 separately , but only their sum , @xmath62    analogously",
    ", the rate of electrons produced per unit time and target deuterons in the sno detector through the charged current reaction  ( [ nud ] ) reads @xmath63 we stress that eqs .",
    "( [ re][rsno ] ) are written in the most general way and with no approximation . a final remark about units .",
    "if @xmath14 is given in @xmath64s@xmath65 and the cross sections in @xmath66 , then the rates @xmath67 are expressed in units of events per second per target particle ( electrons in sk and deuterons in sno ) , equivalent to @xmath68 generalized `` solar neutrino units '' ( snu s ) .",
    "given that the molecular weight of water ( heavy water ) is 18 g / mol ( 20 g / mol ) , one snu corresponds to 28.9 event / kton / day in sk ( 5.2 event / kton / day in sno ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the energy averaged cross sections @xmath69 and @xmath70 as a function of the sk threshold @xmath8 , as well as @xmath71 as a function of the sno threshold @xmath13 .",
    "we remind that such cross sections include the effect of the detector energy resolution [ see eqs .",
    "( [ sigmax],[barsigmax ] ) ] .",
    "figure  2 shows the normalized response functions of sk ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) and sno ( @xmath74 ) as a function of the neutrino energy , for representative values of the detector thresholds . as shown in the previous section , the quantities in figs .  1 and 2",
    "characterize completely the response of sk to @xmath17 scattering and of sno to @xmath75 absorption .    from fig .  2",
    ", one can see that the response functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are almost coincident ; for any practical purpose , one can assume that @xmath76 to a very good approximation .",
    "this is not surprising , since the cross sections for @xmath77 and @xmath78 scattering have a similar shape in the range probed by sk , up to an overall factor @xcite .",
    "it is more intriguing to notice that the sk and sno response functions in fig .  2",
    "happen to be very similar , provided that the sno threshold is chosen about 2 mev below the sk threshold .",
    "it appears that , using different thresholds and with the help of the energy resolution smearing , the differences in the sk and sno cross sections ( weighted by the @xmath4b neutrino spectrum ) can be largely compensated .    for each fixed value of @xmath8",
    ", we have then maximized the agreement between @xmath79 and @xmath80 by tuning @xmath13 , so as to minimize the integral reminder @xmath81 the results are shown in fig .  3 for some representative values of the thresholds .",
    "one sees that the two response functions @xmath72 and @xmath74 can be equalized to a good approximation .",
    "indeed , we find that the reminder @xmath82 is always @xmath83 .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath84 that minimize @xmath82 satisfy the approximate relation @xmath85 ( mev ) , with an accuracy sufficient for practical purposes .",
    "of course , if the true sno energy resolution function turns out be different from our prospective shape [ see eqs .",
    "( [ r],[delta ] ) ] , this relation can also change slightly .",
    "the comparison of the sk and sno response functions should be finalized when the sno detector will be operated and calibrated .    in short , in the calculations of the electron rates @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath11 one can take @xmath86 within an accuracy of a few percent or less , provided that the sk and sno thresholds obey the empirical relation @xmath87 the model - independent consequences of the two equations above will be worked out in the next section .",
    "we point out that the comparison of the response functions of solar neutrino experiments have always provided useful insights in the interpretation of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "for instance , an empirical equality between the response functions of the homestake and kamiokande experiments to the @xmath4b neutrino flux was used in @xcite and later in @xcite to make some model - independent statements on the @xmath4b flux suppression .",
    "an equality similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqsk ] ) was used in @xcite to derive a lower bound on the @xmath4b flux .",
    "even _ inequalities _ between response functions have been used to study or constrain the neutrino oscillation probabilities @xcite . however , to our knowledge , eqs .",
    "( [ eqsno],[thresh ] ) have not been derived prior to this work .",
    "in this section we derive the model - independent consequences of the empirical equality ( [ eqsno ] ) , which holds with a precision of a few percent or less , when @xmath13 and @xmath88 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ thresh ] ) .",
    "we also discuss the associated uncertainties .    from eqs .",
    "( [ re][rsno ] ) and eqs  ( [ eqsno],[thresh ] ) one easily derives a first important relation , @xmath89 which allows to determine in a model independent way the fractional contribution of ( purely neutral current ) @xmath2 interactions to the total @xmath17 scattering rate @xmath61 in super - kamiokande .",
    "we stress that the above equation _ does not depend _ on either @xmath14 or the probability functions @xmath90 ; in particular , it holds also for nonzero mixing with a sterile neutrino , @xmath91 .    under the hypothesis of no oscillations into sterile states , @xmath92 ,",
    "a second important relation can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ re][rsno ] ) and eqs  ( [ eqsno],[thresh ] ) : @xmath93\\ . \\label{ii}\\ ] ] the above equation gives @xmath14 independently of the functional form of @xmath94 .",
    "equations  ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) represent the main results of our work .",
    "a supplementary relation can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ re][rsk ] ) and ( [ eqsk ] ) , under the hypothesis that @xmath92 _ and _ that the boron neutrino flux @xmath14 is known independently ( e.g. , from standard solar models ) : @xmath95 the above equation makes use of sk data only ( @xmath5 ) and does not depend on @xmath94 ; however , its uselfuness is limited by the requirement of a prior knowledge of @xmath14 . using a recent standard solar model calculation of @xmath14 @xcite and the latest sk data @xcite the term subtracted from unity in eq .",
    "( [ iii ] ) amounts to @xmath96 .",
    "we will use this model - dependent value only for some prospective error estimates , as we discuss in the following .    in order to extract @xmath97 by means of eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) , one has to consider both theoretical and experimental errors .",
    "theoretical errors are of two different types : ( i ) uncertainties in the cross section ratio @xmath98 ; and ( ii ) approximations implicit in eq .",
    "( [ eqsno ] ) .",
    "the first are dominated by the overall normalization of the cc cross section for @xmath75 absorption , whose uncertainty is about @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "concerning the approximations implicit in eq .",
    "( [ eqsno ] ) one should note that , if @xmath100 , then the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) acquires an additional `` error term '' equal to @xmath101 . the integral reminder @xmath82 ( see eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) ) gives an upper limit to @xmath102 , as @xmath103 .",
    "actually , @xmath104 is much smaller than @xmath82 in several oscillation cases of fenomenological interest ( e.g. , for both vacuum and matter enhanced solutions to the solar neutrino problem ) .",
    "we have checked that @xmath105 in the worst cases .",
    "if standard solar models are not too wrong , the factor @xmath106 in @xmath107 is in the range @xmath108@xmath109 ( as the rate observed in sk is about 1/21/3 than rate expected ) .",
    "therefore , we estimate that the approximations implicit in eq .",
    "( [ eqsno ] ) introduce at most an error @xmath110 in equation eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .",
    "being much smaller than the uncertainty ( i ) , this error can be neglected .",
    "we also checked that this conclusion holds when allowance is made for variations of the sk ( sno ) energy resolution function within the quoted @xcite ( prospected @xcite ) errors .",
    "concerning the experimental uncertainties in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) , they are associated with the term @xmath111 . the present fractional error of @xmath5 is 34% [ eq .",
    "( [ r1],[r2 ] ) ] .",
    "however , the fractional error for @xmath11 can not be precisely evaluated before sno starts operation and its background is measured .",
    "if we assume , conservatively , a total ( sno+sk ) uncertainty of @xmath112 for @xmath111 , then the total fractional error of the subtracted term in eq .  ( [ i ] ) is @xmath113 ( theoretical and experimental errors added in quadrature ) .",
    "of course , the central value of the subtracted term ( i.e. , of the @xmath1 contribution to the total sk rate ) can only be guessed at present . if we take the value @xmath114 from the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ iii ] ) , then @xmath115 , implying that the @xmath2 signal can be extracted at @xmath116 from eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .    concerning the estimate of @xmath14 from eq .",
    "( [ ii ] ) , one expects an uncertainty of about 20% from the same arguments .",
    "this value is comparable to the uncertainty affecting the theoretical estimates of @xmath14 from solar models @xcite and to the expected error of the neutral current event rate in sno @xcite ( which also provides @xmath14 in the absence of sterile neutrino oscillations @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ ii ] ) provides us with a competitive , independent estimate of the the boron neutrino flux . of course , all these error estimates should be finalized when the actual data from sk and sno will be compared .",
    "finally , we remind that eqs .",
    "( [ i],[ii ] ) hold when the cross sections are expressed in @xmath66 , the rates in events per target particle per second , and @xmath14 in @xmath64s@xmath65 .",
    "we think it useful to rewrite and summarize our results by using also the following units : @xmath117=[r_{\\rm sno}]= { \\rm kton}^{-1}{\\rm d}^{-1}$ ] , @xmath118={\\rm cm}^{-2}{\\rm s}^{-1}$ ] , and @xmath119={\\rm cm}^2 $ ] .",
    "then , independently of the functional form of the oscillation probabilities @xmath34 , one has : @xmath120 and @xmath121 provided that the sk and and sno thresholds obey the empirical eq .",
    "( [ thresh ] ) . for these joint values of thresholds",
    ", we have tabulated the relevant cross sections in table  i.    we conclude with a numerical example . choosing a threshold @xmath122 mev for sk , the corresponding observed event rate @xmath5 is estimated to be 0.61 events / kton / day [ eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) ] .",
    "the sno threshold appropriate for comparison with sk is @xmath123 mev [ see eq .",
    "( [ thresh ] ) ] . if sno measures , say ,",
    "8 events / kton / day above such threshold , then one obtains , using the cross sections in table  i , @xmath124 [ for any @xmath125 , eq .",
    "( [ sum1 ] ) ] and @xmath126 [ for @xmath92 , eq .",
    "( [ sum2 ] ) ] .",
    "we have found that an approximate equality holds between the super - kamiokande and sno ( charged current ) response functions [ eq .  ( [ eqsno ] ) ] , provided that their thresholds @xmath8 and @xmath13 are chosen appropriately [ eq .",
    "( [ thresh ] ) ] .",
    "we have taken advantage of this property , by showing that one needs only two data ( the total electron rates @xmath127 and @xmath11 ) to determine , in a model independent way , two important quantities : ( a ) the @xmath2 contribution to the sk signal , even in the presence of additional mixing with a sterile neutrino [ eq .  ( [ sum1 ] ) ] ; and ( b ) the absolute boron neutrino flux , in the absence of oscillations into sterile states [ eq .  ( [ sum2 ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the total charged current event rate in sno appears to be very interesting and informative in itself , and not only in relation with the neutral current measurement to be performed in the same experiment .",
