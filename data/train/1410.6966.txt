    "in this paper , we study the problem of global testing for periodicity .",
    "suppose @xmath1 , is a real - valued time series observed at equispaced time points , that satisfies the model @xmath2 where the noise @xmath3 are i.i.d .",
    "normal variables . in the complex - valued case ,",
    "similarly , the observed series satisfies the model @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents zero - mean i.i.d .",
    "complex white noise , that is , @xmath6 with @xmath7 \\sim\\mathcal{n}(\\mathbf{0 } , \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\mathbf{i}_{2})$ ] .",
    "in both cases , we are interested in testing @xmath8 in which periodicity exists in the series under the alternative .    global detection of periodic patterns in time series analysis have various applications .",
    "we give several examples as follows :      global detection of sinusoidal signals is a fundamental signal processing task prior to information extraction @xcite .",
    "as summarized in @xcite , global testing for waveforms can be utilized in radar and sonar systems , such as detecting whether aircrafts are approaching @xcite and detecting whether enemy submarines are present @xcite .",
    "global detection of periodic patterns in time series due to various biological rhythms such as cell division , circadian rhythms , life cycles of microorganisms and many others is an important problem in gene expression studies @xcite .",
    "for example , in order to identify a collection of genes which are responsible in the cell cycle , it was proposed in @xcite to implement global testing of periodicity for each gene expression time series .",
    "@xmath9-values for these test statistics are subsequently calculated , and then multiple testing is performed based on these @xmath10-values while controlling the false discovery rate ( fdr ) at a prespecified level , so that periodically expressed genes are identified .",
    "further improvements of this method appear in @xcite and references therein .",
    "global testing for periodicity dates back to the well - known fisher s test @xcite , which is based on the maximum value of the normalized standard periodogram of the observed series .",
    "this test enjoys some optimality properties as long as there is only one sinusoid under the alternative and its frequency lies on the fourier grid @xmath11 .",
    "since then substantial extensions and improvements have been made in the literature .",
    "based on an adaptive set of largest normalized standard periodogram values , an extension of fisher s test was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is empirically shown to be more powerful than fisher s test when there are multiple periodicities with fourier frequencies under the alternative . in @xcite , a modified fisher s test",
    ", in which the maximum periodogram is normalized by a trimmed mean of the periodograms ( as suggested in @xcite ) , was proposed and analyzed .",
    "this test is also more powerful than fisher s test when there are multiple periodicities under the alternative . in @xcite ,",
    "a test statistic was proposed against the alternative when there is a single sinusoid whose frequency is unknown and not necessarily on the fourier grid .",
    "a more general hypothesis test is given in @xcite , where the signal of interest consists of a fixed number of sinusoids .",
    "the higher criticism test proposed in @xcite can also be applied to the standard periodogram for global detection , and it enjoys certain asymptotic minimaxity properties against alternatives in which the periodicities are sparse and consist of fourier frequencies .    in the existing literature on global testing for periodicity , either the contributing sinusoids are constrained to have fourier frequencies , or the number of periodicities is fixed and small compared to the sample size .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to construct a new test based on an _ over - sampled periodogram _ that adapts to _ a growing number of _ sinusoids with _ general _ frequencies .",
    "the focus of our work is to establish the asymptotic optimality of our method .",
    "our discussion throughout the paper is focused on complex - valued time series . as indicated in section  4.1 of @xcite and section  1.5 of @xcite , complex - valued time series",
    "are sometimes more convenient for analysis . moreover ,",
    "complex - valued or bivariate time series arise naturally in modern data analysis such as functional mri , blood - flow and oceanography ; see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "periodicity detection in real - valued series will be briefly discussed in section  [ secdiscussion ] .    for ease of analysis",
    ", we slightly simplify the complex time series model  ( [ eqcomplexmodel ] ) as follows : @xmath12 where the design matrix @xmath13 with @xmath14 is an _ extended discrete fourier transform _ ( edft ) matrix , that is , @xmath15 the vector of coefficients @xmath16 contains information of magnitudes and phases in ( [ eqcomplexmodel ] ) , and its sparsity under the alternative , denoted as @xmath17 , is assumed to be _",
    "unknown_. the noise level @xmath18 is assumed to be known , and we let @xmath19 throughout the paper without loss of generality .",
    "a distinct feature of our model in ( [ eqmeasurement ] ) is that the value of @xmath10 can be arbitrarily large , and is assumed to be _",
    "unknown_. this implies that the design matrix @xmath20 is actually unavailable",
    ". moreover , adjacent columns in @xmath20 are nearly parallel , which is different from the common assumption in high - dimensional regression models in which the columns of the design matrices are pairwise incoherent .",
    "a broad class of combinations of periodicities can be represented by the mean @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath22 is @xmath17-sparse , @xmath21 is a superposition of @xmath17 complex sinusoids . the global test for periodicity",
    "is therefore modeled as @xmath23    we now define the over - sampled periodogram for complex - valued time series , which turns out to be surprisingly simple . for some integer @xmath24 ,",

    "define @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the tail probability of the standard complex normal variable as shown in lemma  [ teocomplextail ] , and @xmath32 is defined in ( [ eqoversampledperiodogram ] ) . notice that under the null , all @xmath33 are standard complex - valued normal variables , which implies @xmath34 for any fixed @xmath35 .",
    "the proposed test statistic is defined as @xmath36 for which appropriate choices of the interval @xmath37 $ ] are discussed in sections  [ sectheory ] and  [ secnumerics ] .",
    "we will fix a threshold level @xmath38 , and reject @xmath39 if and only if @xmath40 .",
    "this test is referred to as the _ over - sampled periodogram higher criticism _ ( ophc ) test .",
    "an important question is how to choose the over - sampling rate @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 . roughly speaking , the success of detection by the higher criticism based on the sequence @xmath43 depends on whether @xmath44 has @xmath17 nonzero elements with sufficiently large magnitudes .",
    "if the frequencies are on the fourier grid , the spikiness of @xmath44 is implied by the spikiness of @xmath22 .",
    "for example , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 by choosing @xmath47 , we can calculate that @xmath44 has sparsity one , and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the proposed test is desirable as long as @xmath49 is sufficiently large .",
    "however , if the frequencies are off the fourier grid , then for @xmath47 , the spikiness of @xmath22 may not imply the spikiness of @xmath44 .",
    "for example , if @xmath50 and one chooses @xmath47 , simple calculation yields @xmath51 this means the resulting @xmath44 is not as spiky as in the case where the frequencies are on the fourier grid , and then the performance of higher criticism based on @xmath43 may be not optimal .    in order to increase the spikiness of @xmath44 , we propose to choose the over - sampling rate @xmath52 .",
    "our main result theorem  [ upperboundsparse ] guarantees that as long as the frequencies of the complex sinusoids in the mean of @xmath53 obey some minimum separation condition , this over - sampling rate leads to an asymptotically optimal global test .",
    "a key step in the proof is to show that @xmath44 has @xmath17 significant nonzero components . ) . ] in other words , the spikiness of @xmath22 is translated to the spikiness of @xmath44 .",
    "we emphasize that this over - sampling rate is independent of the grid parameter @xmath10 and the sparsity @xmath17 .",
    "the higher criticism method was originally coined by john tukey and introduced in donoho and jin @xcite for signal detection under a sparse homoscedastic gaussian mixture model , which was previously studied in ingster @xcite .",
    "cai , jin and low @xcite investigated minimax estimation of the nonnull proportion @xmath54 under the same model .",
    "hall and jin @xcite proposed a modified version of the high criticism for detection with correlated noise with known covariance matrices .",
    "cai , jeng and jin @xcite considered heteroscedastic gaussian mixture model and showed that the optimal detection boundary can be achieved by a double - sided version of the higher criticism test .",
    "the papers @xcite considered a related problem of detecting a signal with a known geometric shape in gaussian noise .",
    "cai and wu @xcite studied the detection of sparse mixtures in the setting where the null distribution is known , but not necessarily gaussian and established the adaptive optimality of the higher criticism for the detection of such general sparse mixtures .    in the special case in which @xmath55 ,",
    "that is , the frequencies are on the grid , the design matrix becomes the orthogonal dft matrix .",
    "multiplying the measurement by the inverse dft matrix , the design matrix is reduced to the identity design .",
    "therefore , the problem becomes equivalent to the standard sparse detection model discussed in @xcite , and the standard higher criticism test proposed in @xcite can be directly applied .",
    "notice that in the ophc test defined above , choosing @xmath47 in ( [ eqmatrixu ] ) is equivalent to multiplying the measurement by the inverse dft , so there is no need to over - sample the periodogram .      if the dimension @xmath10 in ( [ eqmeasurement ] ) were known , the hypothesis testing model ( [ eqmeasurement ] ) considered in the present paper is also closely related to the global testing problem under a linear model with sparse alternatives .",
    "it is helpful to review some well - known results for the real - valued case in this line of research .",
    "consider the linear model : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the design matrix and regression coefficients , respectively .",

    "the tradeoff between the signal strength and sparsity is reduced to a quantitative relationship between @xmath49 and @xmath17 for fixed @xmath62 and @xmath10 .",

    "the condition @xmath74 is crucial .",

    "consequently , the mean of @xmath192 amounts to a superposition of complex sinusoids , and the noise part in @xmath192 consists of a sequence of complex white noise .",
