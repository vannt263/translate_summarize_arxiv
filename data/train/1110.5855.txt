    "the core idea of extra dimensional models is to consider the four - dimensional universe as a hyper - surface embedded in a multidimensional manifold .",
    "this original proposal of kaluza and klein @xcite did not attracted much attention at the time . however , this situation changed drastically nowadays after the advent of supergravity and superstring theory where the extra dimensions models are a necessary ingredient @xcite .",
    "more specifically , after randall and sundrum s idea of a brane world with non - factorisable metric , there have been an extensive use of these ideas @xcite .",
    "this model provides a possible solution to the hierarchy problem and show how gravity is trapped to a membrane .",
    "it has been found that the trapping of fields and the associated effective action depends on an associated equation that depends only on the extra dimension @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of these models is that the associated equation can be written in a form very similar to the schrdinger equation with an associated potential .",
    "therefore , the hierarchy problem is reduced to the resolution of a one dimensional quantum mechanics problem . that enriches the problem since",
    "many known tools can be used to investigate the physics of the problem .",
    "an important example of one dimensional quantum mechanics is the well known result of electrons moving in semiconductor heterostructures . in such structures , each material composing the heterostructure",
    "are considered potential barriers felted by the electrons . by solving the schrdinger equation we can compute transmission and reflection coefficients , making possible the understanding of the transport properties and the resonance structures of structure defined by a one - dimensional potential . from the theoretical point of view",
    "such systems have been extensively studied in the 90 s @xcite .",
    "in particular , because of the improvement of numerical computational methods and computer processors , a few more difficult problems without exact solutions were attacked .",
    "the source of those difficulties is the complexity of the several kinds of potentials that should be treated in the schrdinger equation . as an example",
    ", a numerical method was developed in order to solve the problem of potential barriers of any shape . in order to obtain these results numerically , they made use of a common tool in condensed matter systems called the transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the randall - sundrum(rs ) and kaluza - klein models is that the later has a compact extra dimension and the former has an infinity one . as consequence",
    "the kaluza - klein models have a discrete spectrum of mass that depends on the radius of the extra dimension . in this scenario",
    "the spectrum in four dimension is trivially recovered . in rs models",
    "the extra dimension is infinity and the mass spectrum is determined by a schrdinger like equation where the mass spectrum may not be discrete . in both models",
    "it is important to verify if the electromagnetism and gravity are reproduced in first approximation inside the brane . that happens only if the zero mode , or massless mode , is localized in the membrane . in these scenarios",
    "it has been shown that the zero mode of the gravity field and the left hand fermion are localized@xcite .",
    "another class of fields are the gauge or form fields .",
    "the presence of one more extra dimension ( @xmath5 ) provides the existence of many antisymmetric fields , namely the @xmath6 and @xmath7forms .",
    "however , gauge freedom can be used to cancel the dynamics of the @xmath8 and @xmath7form fields in the visible brane .",
    "these fields has been used to describe space - time torsion and the axion @xcite that have separated descriptions by the two - form . besides this , string theory shows the naturalness of higher rank tensor fields in its spectrum @xcite .",
    "other applications of these kind of fields have been made showing its relation with the ads / cft conjecture @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that only the @xmath9form is localized @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum of the two and three form and the respective coupling with the dilaton have been studied , for example , in refs . @xcite .",
    "the study of this kind of coupling , inspired in string theory , is important in order to produce a process that , in principle , could be seen in lhc .",
    "this is a drell - yang process in which a pair quark - antiquark can give rise to a three(two)-form field , mediated by a dilaton .",
    "the rs model has also been modified to consider the membrane as a topological defect generated by a scalar field @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the soliton - like solutions are used to simulate the membrane , and several kinds of defects in brane scenarios are considered in the literature @xcite . this models can be generalized to obtain a rich class of defects by a deformation procedure of the @xmath10 potential @xcite .",
    "it is possible to solve the equations of motion by the super - potential method .",
    "this formalism was initially introduced in studies about non - super - symmetric domain walls in various dimensions by @xcite . as an example , in a recent paper , a model is considered for coupling fermions to brane and/or antibrane modeled by a kink anti - kink system @xcite .",
    "the localization of fields in a framework that considers the brane as a kink have been studied for example in @xcite . in many of these",
    "works the coupling between the dilaton and the form fields is used to produce the desired localization@xcite .    in all above - mentioned models",
    "the massive spectrum is determined by a schrdinger like equation with a potential that falls to zero at infinity .",
    "the spectrum is not discrete and we have a ill defined effective action . despite of that , just like in the case of semiconductor heterostructures , there is the possibility of appearance of resonances .",
    "this analysis have been done extensively in the literature @xcite .    in order to analyze resonances",
    ", we must compute transmission coefficients ( @xmath11 ) , which gives a clear physical interpretation about what happens to a free wave interacting with the membrane .",
    "the idea of the existence of a resonant mode is that for a given mass the transmitted and reflected oscillatory modes are in phase inside the membrane , i. e. , the transmission coefficient has a peak at this mass value .",
    "that means the amplitude of the wave - function has a maximum value at @xmath12 and the probability to find this kk mode inside the membrane is higher .",
    "this method has been used previously to analyze resonant modes of the gravity , fermion and form fields in a previous work@xcite .",
    "as far as we know there is no study in the literature of resonances for form fields without the dilaton and for gravity and fermion fields with the dilaton in a deformed background .",
    "the goal of this piece of work is to apply a numerical method to study aspects of the form fields in a scenario of extra dimensions .",
    "we compute the transmission coefficients of gravity , fermion and form fields in both setups : with and without the dilaton coupling in a deformed scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section two is devoted to discuss a solution of the einsteins equation with source given by a deformed kink with and without the presence of the dilaton . in section three the general prescription to reach the schrdinger equation to the problem is given .",
    "we also present in detail the numerical steps to compute the transmission coefficients with transfer matrix . in section four",
    "we analyze resonances of the gravity field . in section five , six and seven , we present the resonance structure for @xmath13,@xmath14 and @xmath15 forms respectively . in section eight",
    "we present the same study for the fermion fields . at the end",
    ", we discuss the conclusions and perspectives .",
    "we start our analysis by studying the space - time background . it is well known that vector gauge fields in these kind of scenarios are not localizable : in four dimensions the gauge vector field theory is conformal and all information coming from warp factors drops out necessarily rendering a non - normalizable four dimensional effective action .",
    "however , in the work of kehagias and tamvakis @xcite , it is shown that the coupling between the dilaton and the vector gauge field produces localization of the later .",
    "on the other hand , scalar and fermion fields do not need this coupling in order to produce localized zero modes .",
    "therefore , we must consider in this section both backgrounds : with and without the dilaton coupling .",
    "we start our analysis studying the space - time background . before analyzing the resonances of fields ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain a solution of the equations of motion for the coupled gravity - dilaton - brane system . in a previous manuscript the authors considered two cases : with and without the dilaton coupling .",
    "here we find the solution for the deformed case .",
    "as this solution has been studied extensively in the literature we only give a short review of how to reach that .",
    "for the case with the dilaton the action is similar given by @xcite :    @xmath16,\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 , @xmath17 is the metric determinant and @xmath18 is the ricci scalar .",
    "note that we are working with a model containing two real scalar fields .",
    "the field @xmath19 plays the role of membrane generator of the model while the field @xmath20 represents the dilaton .",
    "the potential function depends on both scalar fields .",
    "it is assumed the following ansatz for the spacetime metric : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the metric of the brane , @xmath4 is the co - dimension coordinate , and @xmath23 is a deformation parameter .",
    "the deformation parameter controls the kind of deformed topological defect we want in order to mimic different classes of membranes .",
    "the deformation method is based in deformations of the potential of models containing solitons in order to produce new and unexpected solutions @xcite . as usual",
    ", capital latin index represents the coordinates in the bulk and greek index the ones in the brane . in order to solve this system",
    ", we use the so - called superpotential function @xmath24 , defined by @xmath25 following the approach of kehagias and tamvakis @xcite .",
    "the particular solution follows from choosing the potential @xmath26,\\ ] ] and superpotential @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters to adjust the dimensionality .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , this potential gives us the desired soliton - like solution . in this way , it is easy to obtain first order differential equations whose solutions are solutions of the equations of motion above , namely @xmath30 the solutions for these new set of equations are the following : @xmath31 @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35- \\sum_{n=1}^{s-1}\\frac1{2n}\\tanh^{2n}\\left(\\frac{ay}{s}\\right)\\biggr{\\ } } \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we should point here that we gave the solution for @xmath33 for completeness , but we are not going to analyze this case since this has been done previously .      here",
    "we look for the background solution without the dilaton coupling .",
    "we could repeat all the steps of the last section to arrive at the final solution .",
    "we can also take a short cut and from our previous solution we obtain the desired result . by just setting @xmath39",
    "we can get the final answer .",
    "the metric is now @xmath40 with the resulting potential @xmath41 this solution agrees with the one obtained previously .",
    "we must note that the solution for @xmath42 is left unchanged and therefore the contribution of the dilaton is to change the equations of motion . in the next section we present the general set to be used throughout this paper in order to look for the spectrum of field resonances .    in the limit where @xmath43 we have for @xmath33 : @xmath44 and for @xmath36 @xmath45 note that this represents a localized metric warp factor .",
    "it s worthwhile to observe the effect of deformation parameter @xmath23 in the energy density of the thick brane .",

    "first we take the equation of motion for the field in five dimensions , which generally takes the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a differential operator in five dimensions .",
    "the next step is to separate the differential operator in the brane ( @xmath51 ) and extra dimension(@xmath52 ) and perform a separation of variables in the field @xmath53 .",

    "the potential of the associated schrdinger equation has the general behavior of going to zero at infinity .",
    "this justifies the idea that we must consider plane waves at infinity that will interact with the membrane .",
    "this approach has been put forward successfully in ref .",
    "@xcite where the resonant peaks of many bulk fields in a kink - like membrane were study .",
    "the richness of this model can be widened if we consider another sort of topological defects .",
    "this can be obtained in a simple way by a deformation procedure . due to this deformation",
    "all potentials of the associated schrdinger equation are changed and as a consequence the spectrum of resonances is also modified .",
    "the interesting point here is that , different from the undeformed case we have a very rich structure of resonances . for almost all cases analyzed here",
    "we have found more peaks than the cases studied previously . with this method",
    "we have computed resonances of gravity , fermions and gauge fields .",
    "the results obtained here corroborate our claim that , beyond the coupling with the dilaton , the deformed defect can give us a richer structure of resonances .",
    "the only case in which this is not evidenced is the gravity one .",
    "we see in figs .",
    "[ fig : grav - logts3 ] and [ fig : grav - logts5 ] that we only have one resonance for any case considered .",
    "when we studied the case of form fields , namely the scalar , vector and kalb - ramond fields that became more apparent . if we compare the number of resonances for the scalar field with @xmath33@xcite and with @xmath93 in figs .",
    "[ fig : logts3q0 ] ( a ) and [ fig : logts5q0 ] ( a ) we found @xmath160,@xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "the vector and kalb - ramond fields have similar behavior .",
    "the analyzes of the fermion resonances also corroborate these ideas . for this case we found in figs .",
    "[ fig : logts3-fermion - eta10 ] and [ fig : logts5-fermion - eta10 ] many peaks of resonances that rises when we increase the value of @xmath23 .",
    "for example , if we compare figs .",
    "[ fig : logts3-fermion - eta10 ] ( d ) and [ fig : logts5-fermion - eta10 ] ( d ) for the right fermion with the dilaton we see three peaks for @xmath47 and seven peaks for @xmath48 .",
    "it is important mentioning that for these phenomenological models , many massive modes are expected to interact with the membrane .    furthermore , there are some applications of the models studied here related to ads / cft correspondence : there are evidences supporting the idea of domain wall / qft , i.e. , a correspondence between gauged supergravities and quantum field theories in domain walls .",
    "important applications are related to the study of quark - gluon plasma via gravity - duals . as a perspective",
    ", we will try to adapt this numerical method to attack such kind of problem .",
    "we would like to thank the laboratrio de leos pesados .",
