    "pulsar timing uses the stable rotation of distant pulsars as clocks .",

    "the fundamental signature of a gravitational wave passing between the earth and the distant pulsar is a change in the time of flight for individual pulses , advancing or retarding their time of arrival compared to the model ephemeris .",
    "the difference between the arrival time of the pulses and the model are known as `` timing residuals , '' and they constitute the basic data stream in pulsar timing searches for gravitational waves .    while the measurement can be made with long - term observations of a single pulsar , the implementation of this method as a viable detection technique has been realized through the development of _ pulsar timing arrays _",
    ", where many pulsars in many parts of the sky are monitored over long periods of time , combining timing residuals from multiple pulsars to search for gravitational waves .",
    "many efforts have been launched on this front , including the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves ( nanograv)@xcite , the parkes pulsar timing array @xcite , the european pulsar timing array @xcite , and the international pulsar timing array @xcite .",
    "the expected astrophysical sources of very - low frequency gravitational waves include supermassive black hole binaries ( smbhb ) , stochastic backgrounds of smbhbs , as well as a variety of other stochastic sources such as phase transitions in the early universe or relic radiation from the big bang .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review of pta sources .",
    "like most gravitational wave detection techniques , pulsar timing arrays are omnidirectional , in the sense that they are sensitive to gravitational waves from any location on the sky . as a general rule of thumb ,",
    "the sensitivity of any particular pulsar to incident gravitational waves is a function of the angle between the line of sight to the pulsar and the line of sight to the gravitational wave source .",
    "this relationship is distinctly evident in the hellings and downs curve @xcite , which relates the correlation of residual signals from two pulsars to their angular separation in the sky .",
    "this work develops a data combination technique known as `` pulsar null streams '' to provide a good estimate of the location of a gravitational wave source on the sky .",
    "this is an explicit analysis technique for determining the sky location of a putative gravitational wave source without engaging in a full parameter search .",
    "source location knowledge absent other parameter information is useful for counterpart searches , as well as restricting the search space of computationally intensive signal searches .",
    "null stream mapping of gravitational wave sources has been described for interferometric detectors @xcite , and relies on the fact that there are correlated gravitational wave signals between detectors in a network . for the case of a pulsar timing array , one has the same situation  a gravitational wavefront will produce a correlated response in the timing of every pulsar in the array .",

    "the advance or delay of the pulse is found by subtracting the pulse record from a model of the pulse arrival times in the absence of a gravitational wave ; the result is referred to as the residual , @xmath1 .",

    "these linear combinations can be constructed from any set of three pulsar data streams and minimized to determine the location of the source on the sky .",
    "given that modern pulsar timing arrays have greater than @xmath32 pulsars as part of the array , there are many different sub - arrays of pulsars that can be chosen to implement the pulsar null stream .",
    "this ability to chose sub - arrays can be exploited to increase the pointing ability of the technique .",
    "note that we have chosen above to do the analysis on a continuous source in the frequency domain , however , this need not be the case .",

    "the dotted signal is another realization of the null signal , computed from an independent subarray made up of three other pulsars in the pta .",
    "the cross section is taken at the correct longitude and one can see that even though the rest of the signal does not resemble the signal from the first three pulsars , it still possesses the same strong dip at @xmath38.,width=326 ]    notice the large dip at the correct value of the sky position . there is a secondary minimum in the cross section , but it is an order of magnitude larger than the primary minimum . figure  [ density1 ] shows the full sky density plot of the null signal .    , for 1 set of three pulsars is shown as a density plot .",
    "darker areas represent low points in the signal , while lighter shades have a higher signal .",

    "in a given null signal there are local minima which do not coincide with the correct sky position .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ beta1 ] , where the null signal given by the solid line has a strong local minimum at around @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , it is common , for a single sub - array of 3 pulsars , to have the absolute minimum for a null signal to be at an incorrect sky position . the true null can be identified , and the overall size of the localization uncertainty can be minimized , by combining the null - signal from multiple sub - arrays of pulsars .",
    "this is one distinct advantage this method has over interferometric networks  the large number of pulsars in the time array yields a large number of sub - arrays that can be combined to create a good null - stream pointing . in this section",
    "we will focus on how to characterize the errors in one sub - array .",
    "the null stream localization error for a given sub - array of pulsars can be characterized by calculating the distance from the correct sky position to the absolute minimum for a given null signal . as one might suspect from localization schemes for other gravitational wave detectors as the angular distance between the pulsars in the null signal increases , the error of the sky location decreases . in fig .",
    "[ errorskymap ] are two examples of what the errors look like for a given null signal .",
    "these plots are constructed by putting three pulsars down at the locations indicated .",
    "then for every point in the sky , we inject a signal , and ask where the minimum in the null signal is . the shading in fig .  [ errorskymap ] indicates the angular distance ( error ) from that point in the sky to the absolute minimum of the null signal .        qualitatively it can be seen that there is less error when the pulsars in the null signal are more separated on the sky .",
    "this can be investigated more quantitatively by averaging over many sets of pulsars with the same separation . in fig .",
    "[ errortriangle1 ] is a statistical analysis of sets of pulsars separated as equilateral triangles in the sky .",
    "each data point represents the average of 40 different triangles sprinkled randomly across the sky .    .",
    "it should also be noted that these errors are still substantial even at larger separations.,width=240 ]    the same gravitational wave source sky location was used for all of the different pulsar placements .",
    "while the error to the minimum decreases substantially for a single sub - array , the absolute minimum still has a significant error , even at large angular separations .",
    "while there is a strong null in the density map of @xmath33 shown in fig .",
    "[ density1 ] , there are strong secondary minima as well across the entire sky .",
    "the location and strength of the secondary minima are dependent on the combined geometric orientations of the source and the pulsars used in constructing the null stream . because the strength of secondary minima varies dramatically with source position , searches for sky position would benefit from reduction in size of the secondary minima with respect to the null at the true sky location of the source .",
    "these secondary minima can be reduced , amplifying the true null , by combining multiple null streams together .    in the case of gravitational wave interferometers",
    "we are limited by the number of observatories at our disposal . however , the pta catalog has more than @xmath32 pulsars .",
    "any three can be used to construct a null stream @xmath41 .",
    "we call any choice of three pulsars a `` sub - array . ''",
    "the sub - array null signals are combined into a single signal by taking their product .",
    "this acts to strengthen the signal while suppressing the random fluctuations in the data . for purposes of comparison",
    "the individual null streams are all normalized by dividing a null signal by its maximum before taking their product .",
    ".,width=336 ]    combining multiple null streams from independent sub - arrays immediately suppresses the secondary minima , quickly revealing the location of the null at the true sky location of a source .",
    "the top sky map in fig .  [ densitysets ] shows the product of 3 independent sets of pulsars .",
    "there are still swaths of low @xmath42 values where the secondary minima are seen in fig .",
    "[ density1 ] , but their relative strength is greatly reduced . the lower sky map in fig .",

    "[ betanulls ] shows the one dimensional cross - sections through the parameter space at a constant value of @xmath2 , showing the strong null at the true source location , and only minor variations across the rest of the sky .    , but the @xmath43th root has been taken , where @xmath43 is the number of sub - arrays in the null stream .",
    "the @xmath43th root is taken in localization comparisons so that the width of the minima can be compared over roughly the same range of values of the null signal.,width=336 ]            while there are immediate gains in localization ability by combining multiple sub - arrays , relative gains are eventually reduced each time a new sub - array is added to the product .",
    "figure  [ localizationnumbersets ] shows one example of how localization ability grows with the number of sub - arrays .    to quantify the amount of localization from multiplying multiple null signals we first normalize the signals further by taking the @xmath44 root of the signal , where @xmath43 is the number of null signals in the product ( see figure  [ betanullsroots ] to see what this looks like )",
    "this gives the null signals the same range .",
    "then define a cutoff value of the null signal given as a percentage of the maximum of the null signal .",
    "looking at the number of square degrees that falls under this cutoff gives a measure of how much one can localize the position of a given source .",
    "these localizations vary depending on the relationship between the gravitational wave source and the pulsars .",
    "another way to characterize the localization is to repeat the more statistical analysis done using sets of equilateral triangles to characterize the error of the minimal signal for a given null signal .",
    "[ errorarea ] shows how the product of null signals significantly decreases the errors in the minimum .",
    "once we get past 3 sub - arrays the error is significantly reduced .",
    "the formal presentation of the null stream solution given by eq .",
    "[ nulleta ] is an idealized , mathematical observation about the nature of the pulsar timing data and the putative signals it contains .",
    "real data , however , is subject to the presence of noise from random processes that can reduce the promising capabilities of this localization method .    the effects of noise can be considered in this demonstration by injecting noise into the residual data for the pulsars at various levels , then examining how it affects the solutions for sky positions .    to produce a noisy data set ,",
    "white gaussian noise @xmath45 is generated using maple and added to the residuals @xmath46 for each pulsar . in the examples here",
    "the mean of the noise is set to zero while the standard deviation is set to the maximum amplitude of the gravitational wave source . while an snr@xmath47 is an accepted standard for detection , here it is difficult to see the effect that noise has on the null signal until the noise is closer to snr@xmath48 .    in figures  [ betanullsnoise ] and [ densitysetsnoise ]",
    "we see that the added noise affects the null signal , but fairly subtly . in fig .",
    "[ betanullsnoise ] we see that by the time we have the product of three null signals we have regained much of the localization we had without noise .    , added using 1 , 3 and 9 sub - arrays of pulsars .",
    "as before these are cross - sections through @xmath34 , the correct ecliptic longitude for the source .",
    "notice that with only one noisy signal it is difficult to discern the correct latitude for the source , however with a product of three null signals we see a marked dip , and with a product of nine null signals an even more localized minimum.,width=336 ]    perhaps counter - intuitively , the null stream approach still provides good localization even when the noise is comparable to the size of the signal , a situation that would be unfathomable in traditional parameter estimation .",
    "this can be understood by considering that the product of null signals amplifies the null ( by making the null smaller ) , while white noise is just as likely to increase the signal as decrease it .    .",
    "the top figure is a single null signal and resembles fig .",
    "[ density1 ] strongly , however there is no dip at the correct sky location , as can be seen in the crossection in fig .",

    "null stream mapping of gravitational wave sources relies on the fact that there are correlated gravitational wave signals between detectors .",
    "the underlying premise of the null stream construction is that for a collection of pulsars observing the same source , the gravitational wave signal is common to all pulsars in the array , but modified by geometric factors related to the relative position of the source on the sky .",
    "we have shown how a linear combination of three pulsar timing streams gives a signal that is minimized at the correct sky location of the gravitational wave source , though not as localized as one might need for electromagnetic counterpart searches .",
    "further we have characterized the error and localization ability of one null signal .",
    "though there are significant errors with one null signal when multiple signals are combined as products the errors decrease and the localization increases dramatically .    the techniques here have focused on analysis in the frequency domain specialized for looking at stable sinusoidal signals expected from super massive black hole mergers , however , future work will consider how these sky localization techniques will work for burst type sources in the time domain ."
