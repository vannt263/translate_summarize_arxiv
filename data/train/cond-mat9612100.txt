    "in the last decade much attention has been paid to the phenomenon known as self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "bak , tang , and wiesenfeld ( btw ) @xcite studied a cellular automaton model as a paradigm for the explanation of two widely occurring phenomena in nature : @xmath0 noise and fractal structures .",
    "both have in common a lack of characteristic scales .",
    "the soc models , although not always show @xmath0 noise , have no characteristic scales too , and this scale invariance suggests that these systems are critical in analogy with classical equilibrium critical phenomena , but in soc one deals with dynamical nonequilibrium statistical properties . moreover , the system evolves naturally to the critical state without any tuning of external parameters , that is , in a self - organized process .",
    "several cellular automata and coupled map lattices models exhibiting soc have been reported in the literature . in the original sandpile model of bak _",
    "@xcite the system is perturbed externally by a random addition of sand grains . once the slope between neighboring cells has reached a threshold value , sand is transferred between them in a fixed amount . taking this model as a reference",
    ", different dynamical rules have been investigated leading to a wide variety of universality classes .",
    "continuous variables with a full transfer from a cell instead of a fixed discrete amount @xcite , directed flows @xcite , threshold condition imposed on the height , on the gradient , or even on the laplacian @xcite , anisotropy @xcite , are a few examples .",
    "these randomly driven models do not exhibit soc when the interaction rules are not conservative @xcite .",
    "later on , other deterministically driven models have been introduced where conservation is not a necessary condition @xcite .",
    "much more recently , sandpile models with deterministic perturbations but intrinsic randomness in the threshold dynamics have been used to reproduce experimental results on transport properties on rice piles @xcite .",
    "the close connection between these sandpile models and interface depinning has been establish in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "some authors have attempted to connect the randomly driven models to stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "these continuous descriptions are built according to the symmetry rules obeyed by the discrete models in order to achieve a generic scale invariance condition @xcite .",
    "nevertheless none of them neither explicitly nor implicitly includes the threshold condition , which is one of the main characteristics of soc models . on the other hand anomalous diffusion equations with singularities in the diffusion coefficient",
    "have been considered in order to study the deterministic dynamics of the avalanches generated in the critical state @xcite .",
    "latterly , a different approach has been introduced by pietronero and co - workers , using a real - space renormalization procedure to determine the dynamical exponent as well as the avalanche size exponent . @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite one of us studied two nonlinear stochastic differential equations derived from the discrete dynamical rules of two models with different symmetry properties . in principle",
    "one would expect , due to this reason , different critical behavior .",
    "however , it was shown analytically , by means of the dynamic renormalization group ( drg ) @xcite , that both models belong to the same universality class .",
    "the threshold condition was kept but the step function was regularized in order to allow a power series expansion . in the limit that recovers the threshold",
    "it was shown that the coupling constants that distinguish both models become decoupled of the common coupling constants ; since the critical exponents only depend on the latter constants , one obtains the same values for both models .",
    "once this equivalence was established , the most symmetric model was considered , showing that an infinite number of coupling constants was relevant below the upper critical dimension @xmath1 ; by expanding in the number of nonlinearities , the drg procedure , up to first order in @xmath2 , gave an estimate of the dynamical exponent close to the value obtained by scaling arguments and in the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this value of the dynamical exponent is obtained when the flow in parameter space reaches the nontrivial stable fixed point ; nevertheless , when taking into account the physical values of the parameters , they do not lie in the basin of attraction of the fixed point , thus making this computed value in some sense speculative , since it can not be ensured that the flow in parameter space will be able to reach the attractor .",
    "our goal in this paper is to complement the previous work in order to check the validity in the calculation of the critical exponents at the stable fixed points and to analyze the role played by symmetries in randomly driven soc models and , in general , in other models where an infinite hierarchy of nonlinear terms is required .",
    "our procedure also illustrates the effect of symmetry breaking in drg calculations as a mechanism to make the attractors in parameter space accessible for the physical values of the parameters in the original equations .",
    "the continuum equation for the btw and zhang s models is introduced in sect .",
    "ii , as well as the alternative regularization which breaks the symmetry that distinguish both models . in sect .",
    "iii we develop the drg procedure and show that this symmetry is irrelevant , in view of the fact that the nontrivial fixed point is not modified by this new approach .",
    "moreover , the effect of symmetry breaking allows the flow of the original parameters to reach the nontrivial fixed point , where the critical exponents can now be computed .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in sect .",
    "first , we describe briefly the dynamics of the two soc models under consideration . the first model was originally proposed by zhang @xcite , and it consists of a @xmath3-dimensional lattice in which any site can store some continuously distributed variable @xmath4 .",
    "this variable , that we will call energy , can have different physical interpretations @xcite .",
    "the system is perturbed by adding a random amount of energy @xmath5 at a randomly chosen site .",
    "once a site reaches a value of the energy greater than the threshold value @xmath6 , this site becomes active , and transfers all its energy to its nearest neighbors . at this point the input of energy from the outside is turned off .",
    "the energy transferred to the neighboring sites can make them active , giving rise to an activation cluster or avalanche , that ends when all the sites have reached a value of the energy smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "it is only when the avalanche has stopped that energy is added again , otherwise the system remains quiescent . in this way",
    "there is a clear time - scale separation in the dynamics .",
    "the external noise acts in a slow time scale , whereas the avalanches evolve infinitely fast , in comparison .",
    "the second model differs from zhang s model only in the amount of energy an active site transfers to its neighbors , which is a fixed amount @xmath6 , instead of its whole energy @xmath4 .",
    "therefore it is closer to the original sandpile model of bak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but continuous in @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath7 is not random but fixed this difference becomes irrelevant .",
    "for this reason , it will be referred as btw model .",
    "notice that both models are conservative , in the sense that the added energy ( always positive ) is only dissipated at the open boundaries .",
    "the microscopic evolution rules can be written from time @xmath8 ( in the fast time scale ) to @xmath9 for each site @xmath10 as    [ discrete ] @xmath11 and @xmath12    for zhang s and btw model , respectively .",
    "the sum runs over the @xmath13 nearest neighbors of site @xmath10 , labeled as @xmath14 , and the threshold condition enters through the heaviside step function @xmath15 , defined as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . due to the continuous nature of the models the value @xmath18 is irrelevant and we can keep it undefined , by now . for the external noise @xmath19 , that drives the system only when there are no active sites , one can formally write @xmath20 ,   \\label{discretenoise}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the kronecker delta symbol and @xmath22 is a random vector pointing the site of the lattice that will be perturbed with a random amount of energy @xmath7 ( in the original btw model @xmath23 ) . the product runs over all the lattice sites .    when applying the drg one deals with infinite systems and then the important effect of dissipation at the open boundaries",
    "is not taken into account .",
    "however in soc models a distribution of absorbing defects through the lattice plays the same role as the open ( absorbing ) boundaries @xcite , as we have verified through computers simulations @xcite .",
    "then , we can redefine our models in an infinite lattice but with a quenched distribution of defects .",
    "the results are not modified with this assumption .",
    "another possibility is to consider that each site of an infinite lattice has a small probability of dissipating an amount of energy @xmath24 when it topples , instead of transferring it to a certain neighbor .",
    "this procedure , that represents the assumption of random boundaries , implies that when a site receives a toppling from some neighbor , it has a small probability of not to accept the amount of energy @xmath24 , that is lost @xcite .",
    "this dissipation can be included as a new term in the noise , and eq .",

    "( [ continuumexact ] ) , breaking the time scale separation .",
    "then the noise @xmath36 acts continuously in time and can provoke avalanches to overlap .",
    "however for small enough noise this is very unlikely , and one can still identify avalanches in computer simulations . moreover",
    "the dynamical exponent does not change with this assumption @xcite , due to the fact that the added noise is orders of magnitude smaller than the energy transferred by the avalanche and then its dynamics is not affected . in this case",
    "we still have two time scales , although they overlap . in",
    "what follows @xmath36 will be considered as an additive random process , including two effects , the external driving , always positive , and the dissipation at the ( random ) boundaries , always negative . in the statistical stationary state",
    "the random input of energy must equal on average the output at the boundaries .",
    "then we assume that @xmath38 in fact this is the same assumption done in all the studies of soc by means of drg @xcite , and it is somehow equivalent to the stationary condition used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover we are mainly interested in the spatio - temporal propagation of a perturbation through the system , that is , in measuring the value of the dynamical exponent . for this purpose",
    "we have to look at the system in the fast time scale , i.e. , the scale of the evolution of the avalanches . in ref . @xcite it was argued that in this case one can understand the noise as a quenched gaussian process uncorrelated in space , and then its correlation function is given by @xmath39 when looking at the system at the slow time scale one can not use this prescription for the noise , which has to be uncorrelated in time too , i.e. , @xmath40 , and this prescription is mainly related to the interface roughness between avalanches @xcite",
    ".    equations ( [ continuumexact ] ) , ( [ noise0 ] ) , and ( [ external ] ) , together with the fact that the noise is a gaussian process , define completely our model . however , the presence of the step function in eq .",
    "( [ continuumexact ] ) gives rise to a strong nonlinearity .",
    "a perturbative expansion of this equation can be performed if one regularizes the step function as @xmath41 and makes a series expansion of @xmath42 in powers of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath43 must be monotonously increasing with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "several functions of this type have been used in the literature , but that coming from the error function as @xmath48 allows a power expansion that has an infinite radius of convergence , in contrast with previous choices @xcite . in any case , the relevant results do not depend on the particular form of @xmath43 .",
    "the regularization given by eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) keeps the symmetry of the step function and therefore the invariance under a parity transformation in the btw model .",
    "as an alternative regularization that breaks this invariance we propose the following : @xmath49 with @xmath50 an arbitrary constant .",
    "although in the limit @xmath51 we recover the step function , we do not recover its symmetry anymore , because @xmath52 if @xmath53 , and this is the reason for the breaking of the symmetry in the btw model .",

    "( [ continuumexact ] ) we can write @xmath60 where the effective diffusion constant @xmath61 and the coupling constants @xmath62 ( that make the equation nonlinear ) take different values depending on the model : @xmath63 on the one hand , for @xmath64 , since all the even derivatives verify @xmath65 , all even coupling constants vanish for the btw model , whereas they do not for the zhang s one . using eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) this fact allows to verify the symmetry of the btw model under the parity transformation of the order parameter @xmath4 . on the other hand , for @xmath53 , the even coupling constants do not vanish in any case , and this fact constitutes the symmetry breaking for the btw model . then , under this condition , the only difference between both models is that the constants depend on @xmath66 in a different way ; however it is easy to see that in the limit @xmath67 both sets of constants are identical and then the zhang s model and the broken - symmetry btw model have to belong to the same universality class .",
    "this fact can only be shown for @xmath68 .",
    "nevertheless , the fact of considering @xmath69 only introduces a difference in the value of @xmath70 , which is irrelevant in a continuous model , and then one can include the ( symmetric ) btw model in this universality class too .",
    "at this point it is worth noting that we have transformed a stochastic coupled map lattice , that involves a threshold condition and presents a clear separation of time scales , into a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation , where the nonlinearity of the threshold is described by an infinite series of powers and the randomness enters via a gaussian process , with zero mean to account for the dissipation at the boundaries . along this transformation , and due to the approximations we have performed concerning the noise correlation , we have broken the time scale separation since the noise acts constantly in time .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that such an equation explains the dynamical properties of the system within the fast time scale of the propagation of the avalanches . as we have mention before and it is discussed in @xcite , to deal with the slow time scale , where the avalanches are instantaneous",
    ", another noise correlation is more appropriate .",
    "the model to be studied by the drg is defined by the nonlinear partial differential equation ( [ series ] ) and the gaussian noise given by ( [ noise0 ] ) and ( [ external ] ) . as a previous step we can check the relevance of the different coupling constants in this equation by naive dimensional analysis : a change of scale @xmath71 : @xmath72 is performed in eqs .",

    "this choice gives @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 then one can see that when we apply iteratively the transformation ( @xmath81 ) for @xmath82 all the nonlinear terms vanish and they are irrelevant .",
    "however , all the coupling constants go to infinity for @xmath83 , and hence all nonlinear terms become relevant ; this implies that the upper critical dimension is @xmath1 , and nontrivial values of the exponents are expected below it .",
    "the relevance of all the terms makes our problem much more complicated than for instance the kardar - parisi - zhang model of interface growth , where only the first nonlinear term is relevant @xcite .",
    "the appropriate treatment of eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) would be to renormalize the infinite number of relevant coupling constants that are involved .",

    "[ htbp ] = 5truein 0.15truein [ flow3 ]    now , by introducing the alternative regularization ( @xmath53 ) , we will see the effect of the symmetry breaking .",
    "first of all , we insist that the stable fixed points are the same as for @xmath64 , due to the fact that @xmath165 renormalizes to zero . moreover , as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , where we have plotted the flow lines of eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) obtained by numerical integration , the basin of attraction of the nontrivial fixed point is delimited by the parabola @xmath166 which is also a particular solution of the flow equations , no matter the value of @xmath3 .",
    "this parabola is inside the region defined by eq .",
    "( [ initialcond ] ) , and this fact implies that the new regularization makes possible to reach the attractor for @xmath143 starting in the region of physical meaning . using eqs .",
    "( [ initiallambda ] ) and ( [ basin ] ) together with ( [ error ] ) one gets that the condition to converge towards the nontrivial fixed point is @xmath167 .",
    "then , the parameter that breaks the symmetry in the regularization of the step function , which in principle was arbitrary , determines the behavior of the system in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "[ htbp ] = 5truein 0.15truein [ flow23d3 ]    for @xmath82 the flow is more complex , because of the six fixed points , but the result is that convergence towards the gaussian one also happens for our initial conditions , as fig .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the fixed points gives the same results as the numerical integration shown in the figure .",
    "however this linear analysis fails for @xmath168 , where all the fixed points collapse towards the gaussian one .",
    "it is by means of the numerical integration that we verify that it is an attractor for the region above the parabola given by eq .",
    "( [ initialcond ] ) , but for the region below it is a repeller .",
    "this strange behavior appears because in @xmath168 we are at the bifurcation point .",
    "[ htbp ] = 5truein 0.15truein [ flow23d5 ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown for the btw model and @xmath64 that @xmath169 , whereas for the zhang s model , although the even coupling constants do not vanish , it was argued that their flow equations became decoupled from the odd ones in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "this fact enabled to establish the same universality class for both models , and to deal with only odd terms in eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) .",
    "then , an expansion in the number of coupling constants was performed , whose extrapolation compares well with the results of the simulations @xcite .",
    "note that in the simulations one computes the dynamical exponent relating the characteristic length and lifetime of the avalanches , whereas within the drg framework one computes the dynamical exponent from the fluctuations of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "the agreement between these calculations confirms the basic scaling hypothesis that in both cases length and time are related by means of the same exponent .",
    "however , the problem of this calculation was that the nontrivial fixed point was unreachable for the original equation .    in our approach , due to",
    "the symmetry breaking , we have to consider also the effect of even coupling constants . in the present work we have dealt with a restricted problem with only the lower - order even and odd coupling constants , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , showing that @xmath120 renormalizes to zero , supporting the calculation of ref . @xcite",
    ". then the stable fixed points are not modified by the presence of an even coupling constant in the model , but due to the symmetry breaking that we have introduce , the nontrivial one is an attractor in the parameter space when the parameters corresponding to the real model are taken into account .",
    "this behavior should be the same for any even coupling constant ; actually , preliminary calculations including @xmath170 and @xmath171 in eq .",
    "( [ order3 ] ) make us to suspect that all even coupling constants renormalize to zero .",
    "this fact means that in the hydrodynamic limit the solution of both models has to be symmetric under parity transformations of the order parameter ; then , for the btw model the drg restores the broken symmetry , whereas for the zhang s model we conclude that its asymmetric nature is irrelevant in the behavior at large distances and long times .",
    "therefore this validates the extrapolation performed in @xcite since now we have showed that the symmetry breaking makes the stable fixed points reachable , when starting in the region of physical interest in the space of parameters .",
    "let us finally mention that in a recent work , ghaffari and jensen @xcite perform a different extrapolation of the same results which show a better agreement with large - scale simulations and with real - space renormalization calculations for the dynamical exponent @xcite .",
    "it is noticeable than the same technique has been applied to the study of the effect of dissipation in a uniformly driven btw model @xcite .",
    "we have studied analytically two models which show self - organized criticality .",
    "the difference between them is that the second one ( btw ) is symmetric under a parity transformation , whereas the first ( zhang s ) model is not . from the microscopic rules one writes a effective long wave - length equation involving the threshold condition , which enters into the equation through a step function , making the equation unapproachable under this form .",
    "we have introduced a new regularization of the step function that breaks the symmetry of the btw model . after a power series expansion , the equation is suitable for the application of the dynamic renormalization group , although it contains an infinite number of relevant coupling constants . in consequence",
    "one has to truncate at some point the expansion in the coupling constants .",
    "the results only have sense if it is possible to extrapolate the values of the exponents up to an infinite number of coupling constants .",
    "we obtain the fixed points of the transformation in parameter space and study carefully their stability and basins of attraction .",
    "then we find that with this regularization it is possible to reach the nontrivial fixed point for @xmath143 , that was unreachable in a previous work , where symmetry was not broken .",
    "this means that in the hydrodynamic limit the models display  scale invariance  .",
    "moreover , in this limit we obtain a symmetric behavior under parity transformations for both models , and therefore the recovery of the broken symmetry for the btw model and the irrelevance of this symmetry for zhang s one .",
    "although we have dealt with a simplified version of the problem , we expect this behavior to be the same for the complete problem , in the sense that all even coupling constants renormalize to zero , validating the calculation of ref .",
    "the application of this technique should also be useful for other kinds of problems in which one deals with thresholds or with an infinite number of nonlinear terms , for instance interface dynamics .",
    "moreover , the performed drg calculation is interesting because it provides an example showing how much important is to know not only the stable fixed points of a drg transformation but also their basins of attraction .",
    "it is remarkable the fact that a simple symmetry breaking can solve the problem of the inaccessibility of the attractors in parameter space .",
    "the fact that the parameter that breaks the symmetry determines the behavior in the hydrodynamic limit is difficult to understand and we believe that it is an artificiality introduced in the calculation by the truncation in the coupling - constants expansion . we expect that higher orders in this expansion will give a behavior independent on the @xmath50 value .",

    "we present further details about the derivation of eqs .",

    "our starting points are eqs .",
    "( [ fourier_equation ] ) and ( [ correlatione ] ) , i.e. , the equations for @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , these equations are only defined for @xmath105 .",
    "the drg procedure consists of splitting the momentum space into two shells , an inner one , with @xmath174 , and an outer one , with @xmath175 .",
    "then the magnitudes that depend on @xmath176 , like the energy @xmath4 , split in the following way @xmath177 where @xmath178 is again the heaviside step function .",
    "this equality defines @xmath179 as the corresponding part of the energy in the inner shell , whereas @xmath180 is the same but defined in the outer shell .",
    "this separation also holds for the bare propagator @xmath181 and the noise @xmath182 .",
    "the drg procedure eliminates the modes of the outer shell , within the same philosophy than the kadanoff transformation does in real space .",
    "then one is only interested in @xmath179 and @xmath183 , whose equations turn out to be equivalent to ( [ fourier_equation ] ) and ( [ correlatione ] ) , but with additional terms due to the coupling between the two shells , via the convolution products . the fact that @xmath180 appears in the inner - shell equations allows a perturbative expansion in the form @xmath184 ( using the equivalent of eq .",

    "then the noise in the outer shell enters into the equation for @xmath179 .",
    "a similar perturbative expansion is done for @xmath185 . by averaging over @xmath186 ,",
    "the contribution of the fast modes is eliminated from the inner shell .",
    "this is done up to one - loop order in the perturbative expansion , that is , the lowest order in the intensity of the noise @xmath77 , which implies that it has to be small enough .",
