    "not much is known from first principles about the topological structure at the thermal phase transition in quantum chromodynamics . how this structure changes at the deconfinement phase transition is not even clear in pure gauge theory .",
    "what we mean by  topological structure  is the characterization of euclidean field trajectories in terms of instantons @xcite and abelian monopoles @xcite and their interrelation .",
    "changes of this structure are expected to be the common mechanism for deconfinement and restoration of chiral symmetry . understanding this mechanism is important for understanding the qcd vacuum .",
    "there was a wave of attention recently for improving lattice actions for gauge fields @xcite ( and fermions ) .",
    "part of the interest was motivated to minimize finite lattice spacing corrections in simulation results obtained on coarse lattices .",
    "one particular approach towards improvement was guided by the desire to construct a perfect action being a fixed point action @xcite with respect to some real space renormalization group ( rg ) transformations . in this context",
    "the concept of inverse blocking came up which is the essence of a new method , recently proposed by degrand et al .",
    "in particular it improves the determination of the topological charge of a lattice configuration .    in the present paper",
    "we want to explore the capability of this method , to resolve more details and different aspects of topological structure . in the neighbourhood of the deconfinement transition of the pure @xmath1 gauge theory , we want to study the space - time distribution of topological charge , correlations of the density with itself and with abelian monopole currents .",
    "the topological charge density , when defined for quantum fields , is obscured by ultraviolet fluctuations which must be removed in some way . cooling @xcite has been invented for this purpose long ago . according to the abelian dominance scenario at large distances @xcite abelian magnetic monopoles are closely related to confinement .",
    "the density @xcite and anisotropy @xcite of these magnetic currents are studied in the maximally abelian gauge @xcite .",
    "these currents are quantized by construction @xcite . this does not exclude the possibility that some part of these currents are lattice artefacts which do not correspond to long distance physics .",
    "correlations indicating a close relation between topological charge and abelian magnetic monopole currents have been studied , not addressing this question .",
    "they have been studied so far for particular instanton configurations @xcite and , as far as the quantized vacuum is concerned , the cooling method has been employed @xcite . however , cooling is known to change the topological structure and has to be used with care .",
    "a closer examination shows that the method of refs .",
    "@xcite gives not only the topological charge but also permits a reasonable definition of the topological density of generic , equilibrium lattice fields with minimal effort .",
    "a better resolution of topological and monopole structure is possible without recourse to cooling .",
    "while the method is applied to extract the topological structure , the monopole activity is changed , too , roughly in proportion to the topological activity ( to be defined below ) .",
    "we shall see that part of it becomes an order parameter of the confinement / deconfinement transition , according to the alleged role monopoles play for confinement .    according to the scope of our present study ,",
    "let us sketch the background of this approach @xcite restricting the discussion to the case of pure gauge field theories .",
    "the starting point is a block spin transformation ( here of scale factor two ) which maps a fine lattice configuration of link matrices @xmath2 to a coarse lattice configuration with link matrices @xmath3 ( each single link being an element of the gauge group @xmath4 ) .",
    "the second ingredient is a general type of action @xmath5 , written on both lattices in terms of wilson loops ( evaluated in various representations ) .",
    "the classical perfectness of this action is guaranteed if there exists an inverse blocking transformation @xmath6 with respect to which the action saturates the inequality @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is some non - negative functional related to the blockspin transformation and @xmath9 is a kind of lagrange multiplier .",
    "once the action and other parameters have been determined , this inequality leads to the target configuration @xmath10 of the inverse blocking by minimization of the l. h. s. , the fixed point action with respect to @xmath10 , with a constraint derived from the coarse configuration @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath10 is found as the result of an iterative relaxation process and can not be explicitely expressed .",
    "we call the mapping @xmath12 one step of inverse blocking . similar to blocking , inverse",
    "blocking can be iterated .",
    "this leads to a sequence of interpolating configurations on finer and finer lattices .    without giving details ,",
    "we mention that the saturated inequality ( [ eq : inequality1 ] ) is constructive for finding the perfect action itself . it has been used @xcite to optimize the ratios between the couplings in front of various loops in different representations within the fixed point action @xmath5 , as well as the other constants related to the block spin transformation .",
    "after this machinery has been set up , the procedure of inverse blocking remains a useful tool of analysis .",
    "doing a sequence of inverse blocking steps one would be able to relate a continuum configuration to any given lattice configuration .",
    "the topological charge of this continuum configuration is _ the topological charge _ related to the given lattice configuration ( the _ classically perfect topological charge _ ) .",
    "this prescription is an important conceptual step forward compared with previous techniques of measuring topological charge on the lattice , eventually used in combination with cooling .",
    "inverse blocking has been used before @xcite only to measure the topological charge of lattice configurations , by evaluating the phillips  stone ( ps ) charge @xcite just on the next finer level .",
    "the success indicates that one step of inverse blocking can be sufficient to have access to the classically perfect topological charge corresponding to the _ continuum _ by means of a _ lattice _ definition .",
    "other lattice algorithms besides ps could also have been used , for instance in order to test the uniqueness of charge .",
    "we will use in this paper a geometric charge due to lscher @xcite and the old plaquette based ( field theoretic or naive ) definition @xcite .",
    "both have the advantage to localize the topological density in space - time which makes them suitable for our present purpose .    the first concern in ref .",
    "@xcite has been that action and topological charge of artificially constructed lattice instantons should be independent of size , if the perfect action is used and the topological charge is measured as described .",
    "this was demonstrated for instanton configurations with @xmath13 .",
    "there were no dislocations , with action @xmath14 ( entropic bound , instanton action @xmath15 ) and non  zero topological charge , among them .",
    "however , the perfect action and the new definition of topological charge are useful also at finite @xmath16 . in the second paper",
    "@xcite a ( truncated ) fixed point action has been successfully tested for scaling of the deconfinement temperature , of the torelon mass , of the string tension and of the topological susceptibility . for the latter",
    ", it has been stressed that inverse blocking has been indispensable to achieve reasonable scaling .",
    "this has nourished the hope that the fixed point action and the inverse blocking prescription for the topological charge can avoid dislocations which otherwise ( for instance in the case of wilson s action ) are known to spoil the continuum limit of the topological susceptibility @xcite .",
    "even the temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility has remained controversial until recently . armed with the new method , the topological susceptibility has been measured across the deconfinement transition @xcite without the ambiguities of the cooling method @xcite .",
    "inverse blocking is not the only technique to avoid cooling .",
    "we only want to mention the use of an improved lattice operator of the topological density @xcite .",
    "this approach has given a much more discontinuous drop @xcite at the deconfinement transition than the inverse blocking method @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give details on the fixed point action , on blocking and inverse blocking .",
    "in section 3 we present results on the string tension . for symmetric lattices",
    "this serves to calibrate the lattice step size @xmath17 in accordance to simulations using the fixed point action .",
    "the finite temperature string tension is computed ( in the confined phase ) from polyakov line correlators .",
    "these results are indicating that the string tension is largely conserved by inverse blocking .",
    "section 4 contains our results on the gross topological features .",
    "the topological susceptibility obtained on inversely blocked configurations in the confined phase is quantitatively reasonable .",
    "the temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility across the phase transition is studied . analysing inversely blocked configurations we observe , apart from the decay of the topological susceptibility , the complete suppression of spatial abelian monopole currents in the deconfined phase . in section 5",
    "we present results on topological charge density  density correlations and on monopole  instanton correlations .",
    "we visualize clusters of topological charge together with their accompanying monopole currents for typical confining configurations . in closing",
    ", directions for further work are pointed out in section 6 .",
    "the simplified fixed point action @xcite is parametrized in terms of only two types of wilson loops , plaquettes @xmath18 ( type @xmath19 ) and tilted @xmath20-dimensional @xmath21-link loops ( type @xmath22 ) of the form @xmath23 it contains several powers of the corresponding linear action terms as follows @xmath24 the parameter of this action have been optimized in ref .",
    "@xcite and are reproduced in table [ tab : weights ] .",
    ".__weight coefficients of the simplified fixed point action _ _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      it has been demonstrated before for certain classical configurations that there is a close connection between instantons and monopole world loops .",
    "one can visualize this in the maximally abelian gauge @xcite .",
    "a nontrivial correlation has been measured between topological charge density and monopole currents in the monte carlo ensemble of euclidean field configurations , too @xcite .",
    "we show here in fig .",
    "[ fig : qlumon_corr ] the analogous normalized correlator for the original monte carlo ensemble ( generated with the fixed point action at @xmath25 in the confinement phase ) and for the corresponding ensemble of inversely blocked configurations .",
    "the latter correlator ( for smoothed configurations ) is slightly wider .",
    "in contrast to the topological density  density correlations , this correlator can be detected in the monte carlo configurations as well .    comparing this with the same ( normalized ) correlation function at @xmath26 in the deconfined phase ( not shown here ) , we find that they are identical as a function of the distance in lattice units within the error bars .",
    "this means that this correlation length changes proportional to the inverse temperature .",
    "we have explained in this paper how inverse blocking can be used to analyze topological structures of genuine quantum configurations , usually hidden under ultraviolet fluctuations .",
    "apart from cooling techniques , inverse blocking is the only way to measure autocorrelations of the topological density giving information on the size of instantons .",
    "information on monopole currents is available also for normal monte carlo configurations .",
    "monopoles are correlated with the topological density , both in monte carlo and inversely blocked configurations . however , the density of monopole currents is reduced , roughly proportional to the topological activity , if a configuration undergoes the procedure of blocking followed by inverse blocking .",
    "only a small part of abelian monopoles seen usually in monte carlo configurations seems to be really important for confinement .",
    "this part survives smoothing in the confinement phase .",
    "we come to this conclusion because the string tension is found to be largely unaffected by the removal of ultraviolet fluctuations .",
    "this observation supports semiclassical scenarios of confinement . in the deconfinement phase , however , we find that spacelike monopoles are strongly suppressed for inversely blocked configurations while only timelike ones survive .",
    "armed with inverse blocking , we can do better than measuring the topological density  density correlation or the correlation between monopoles and topological density .",
    "we are now able to study clustering properties of the topological charge using inversely blocked lattice configurations .",
    "we can relate clusters of topological charge to the diluted network of monopole currents . instead of examining idealized semiclassical configurations under different aspects of topological and monopole structure , the method of inverse blocking",
    "makes it possible to analyze generic euclidean lattice field histories in order to characterize the physical phase one is dealing with .",
    "the results should be interesting for vacuum model builders . in view of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration",
    ", it would be also interesting to study the influence of the inverse blocking rg transformation on the spectrum of the dirac operator .",
    "the study of clusters of topological charge promises to give a more direct access to the parameters and correlations that should be built in an instanton model for qcd at zero and finite temperature . in figs .",
    "[ fig : unsmooth ] and [ fig : smooth_luescher ] lattice hypercubes of one timeslice are marked if the lscher topological charge density exceeds a threshold    value @xmath27 .",
    "different colors symbolize the sign .",
    "the original monte carlo configuration does not allow to guess any structure .",
    "the other picture shows the structure emerging after blocking and inverse blocking .",
    "the effect is the same using either naive or lscher s charge density",
    ". therefore one can abandon to use complicated algorithms and use naive or improved loop ",
    "oriented definitions of topological charge density .",
    "there are two immediate directions for further studies .",
    "* study of the clustering properties of topological charge in individual lattice configurations and of the relation to the monopole currents . * repeating the present explorative study at higher @xmath16 with a particular emphasis on the scale dependence of topological structure .",
    "further progress in the construction of the perfect action should be incorporated into this program .",
    "during the time elapsed since the first submission of our article , several interesting papers have appeared which have attempted to investigate the space time topological structure of lattice gauge fields .",
    "three methods have been used : ( improved ) cooling , fermionic ( spectral ) methods and smoothing .",
    "the latter method had been proposed in this paper as a general , renormalization group oriented pattern recognition method for large scale structures in terms of topological charge and monopoles which conserves the string tension .",
    "while the subsequent studies were mostly focussed on vacuum ( zero temperature ) configurations , the results are still controversial as emphasized in ref . @xcite . as a generic rule",
    ", one can state that improved cooling @xcite is biased towards larger instantons ( because only those are stable ) while the topological susceptibility tends to be lower ; in contrast , the smoothing method ( as developed further by the boulder group @xcite ) favours smaller instanton sizes and tends to find somewhat higher topological susceptibility .",
    "this applies to @xmath1 pure gauge theory where the results can be compared ( but not without additional assumptions ) .",
    "we want to stress an important difference of ref .",
    "@xcite to the work published here .",
    "smoothing has been applied there in an iterative way that leads finally to locally classical configurations .",
    "the number of iterations appears there as somewhat subjective parameter similar to the number of ( unimproved or improved ) cooling steps .",
    "this goes far beyond our intention . from our point of view",
    ", the advantage of smoothing is that it provides a minimal smoothing of quantum fluctuations in clear correspondence to a certain scale .",
    "this scale is well  defined by the highest blocking level .",
    "the effect of smoothing on various abelian projections has been critically examined in ref .",
    "the maximally abelian gauge is the only one which seems to exhibit long range physics also if applied to smoothed lattice fields .",
    "while we had concentrated on the density of monopoles , it has been found there that the property of abelian dominance ( _ i.e. _ dominance of the abelian string tension ) is only partly preserved .",
    "a large number of investigations was studying topological structures using fermionic methods going back to smit and vink @xcite .",
    "it is important in the context of this work that these methods seem to work immediately , without smoothing or cooling techniques which otherwise would have to be applied to the monte carlo lattice gauge field configurations . investigating the spectral flow of the lowest eigenvalues of the dirac operator @xcite these authors are able to count the number of localized lumps ( and identify the respective sign ) of topological charge .",
    "the local topological structure is thereby indirectly accessible through the localization properties of the corresponding eigenmodes .",
    "this has been checked in refs .",
    "@xcite with cooling , but there is no comparison so far with the topological structure detected by smoothing .",
    "we have recently improved our relaxation algorithm for implementing inverse blocking @xcite .",
    "we are now in the position to optimize a fixed point action of moderate complexity for a given inverse blocking parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we could check a new parametrization of the perfect action for @xmath1 which is truncated compared with the action used in ref .",
    "we thank the boulder group for correspondence about that and for providing the truncated action @xcite .",
    "we can now show that the parametrization of table [ tab : weights ] is not compatible with the @xmath28 required .",
    "this inconsistency had forced us to accept ( in this paper ) a smaller effective @xmath9 .",
    "we have convinced ourselves that the statistical observations are independent of this choice although the inversely blocked configurations may differ locally .      c. g. callan , r. dashen and d. j. gross , phys .",

    "<S> renormalization group transformations as discussed recently in deriving fixed point actions are used to analyse the vacuum structure near to the deconfinement temperature . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo configurations are generated using the fixed point action . </S>",

    "<S> the absence of short range vacuum fluctuations in the latter does not influence the string tension . </S>",
    "<S> for the inversely blocked configurations we find the following : ( _ i _ ) the topological susceptibility @xmath0 is consistent with the phenomenological value in the confinement phase , ( _ ii _ ) @xmath0 drops across the deconfinement transition , ( _ iii _ ) density and size of instantons are estimated , ( _ iv _ ) the topological density is found to be correlated to abelian monopole currents and ( _ v _ ) the density of spacelike monopole currents becomes a confinement order parameter . </S>"
