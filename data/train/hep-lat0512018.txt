    "the breaking of the colour - electric string between two static sources is a prime example of a strong decay in qcd  @xcite .",
    "recently , we reported on an investigation of this two state system  @xcite , with a wave function @xmath1 created by a @xmath2 operator and a wave function @xmath3 created by a four - quark @xmath4 operator , where @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 denotes a static source and @xmath7 is a light quark .",
    "we determined the energy levels @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the two physical eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath11 which we decomposed into the components , @xmath12 we characterise string breaking by the distance scale @xmath13 at which @xmath14 is minimized and by the energy gap @xmath15 .",
    "while these energy levels and @xmath13 are first principles qcd predictions , the mixing angle @xmath16 is ( slightly ) model dependent : within each ( fock ) sector there are further radial and gluonic excitations and we truncated the basis after the four quark operator .    in order to obtain dynamical information on the string breaking mechanism , we are studying the spatial energy and action density distributions within the two state system .",
    "in doing so one can address questions about the localisation of the light @xmath17 pair that is created when @xmath18 is increased beyond @xmath13 .",
    "the energy density will decrease fastest in those places where @xmath17 creation is most likely .",
    "perturbation theory suggests that light pair creation close to one of the static sources is favoured by the coulomb energy gain while aesthetic arguments might suggest a symmetric situation with @xmath17 dominantly being created near the centre .",
    "first results on this investigation are presented here .",
    "we use @xmath0 wilson fermions at a quark mass slightly smaller than the physical strange quark and a lattice spacing @xmath19  fm and find  @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath21  mev , where the errors do not include the phenomenological uncertainty of assigning a physical scale to @xmath22  fm . using data on the @xmath2 potential and the static - light meson mass @xmath23 , obtained at different quark masses ,",
    "we determine the real world estimate , @xmath24  fm , where the errors reflect all systematics .",
    "an extrapolation of @xmath25 however is impossible , without additional simulations at lighter quark masses .",
    "these results became possible by combining a variety of improvement techniques : the necessary all - to - all light quark propagators were calculated from the lowest eigenmodes of the wilson - dirac operator , multiplied by @xmath26 , after a variance reduced stochastic estimator correction step .",
    "the signal was improved by employing a fat link static action .",
    "many off - axis distances were implemented to allow for a fine spatial resolution of the string breaking region .",
    "for details see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "+    great care was also spent on optimizing the overlap with the ground states , within the @xmath1 and @xmath3 sectors , using combinations of ape  @xcite and wuppertal  @xcite smearing .",
    "our ape smearing consists of the replacement , @xmath27 @xmath28 denotes a projection operator , back onto the @xmath29 group , and @xmath30 @xmath31 , is the spatial staple - sum , surrounding @xmath32 .",
    "we choose @xmath33 and define our ape smeared links , @xmath34 . for the projection we use , @xmath35    the spatial transporters within our @xmath2 states are products of ape smeared links , taken along the shortest lattice distance between the two sources .",
    "the ape smeared links are also employed for the parallel transport within the wuppertal smearing of light quark sources , used to improve the static - light meson operators : @xmath36 we set @xmath37 and take the linear combination @xmath38 as our smearing function .",
    "best results are obtained by using smeared - local quark propagators .",
    "the quality of the overlap with the static - light mesonic ground state is visualized in the effective mass plot figure  [ fig : effmass ] .",
    "note that we display the effective masses up to physical distances @xmath39  fm .",
    "+    we were able to achieve values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 at @xmath42 for the overlaps of our test wave functions @xmath43 with the respective states on the right hand sides of eqs .",

    "( [ eq : nn ] ) while for smeared plaquettes",
    "@xmath74 is adjusted such that the vacuum expectation value of the average plaquette remains unchanged .",
    "+     +    the plaquette smearing enhances the signal / noise ratio . due to this smearing and the fat link static action used , the peaks of the distributions around the source positions ( that will diverge in the continuum limit ) are less singular than in previous studies of @xmath75 gauge theory at similar lattice spacings  @xcite . in the continuum limit the results from smeared and un - smeared plaquette probes will coincide , away from these self energy peaks .",
    "the draw back of plaquette smearing is that exact reflection positivity is violated .",
    "however , our wave functions are sufficiently optimized to compensate for this .",

    "the distributions agree within errors within the time range @xmath84 .",
    "the results presented here are based on our @xmath85 analysis .",

    "@xcite in figures  [ fig : pot ] and  [ fig : angle ] . in the first figure we also speculate about the scenario in the real world with possible decays into @xmath4 as well as into @xmath86 . for our parameter settings and @xmath0",
    "string breaking occurs at a distance @xmath87  fm . in figure",
    "[ fig : angle ] we show the mixing angle as a function of the distance .",
    "the @xmath4 content of the ground state is given by @xmath88 .",
    "within our statistical errors @xmath16 reaches @xmath89 at @xmath90 .",
    "remarkably , there is a significant four quark component in the ground state at @xmath59 while for @xmath91 the limit @xmath92 is rapidly approached .",
    "+    our basis vectors @xmath1 and @xmath3 are no eigenstates of the system .",
    "the transition rate , @xmath93 , can be related to energy gap and mixing angle : @xmath94 .",
    "this means that @xmath95 . with a transition rate of only about 25  mev in the string breaking region and even smaller @xmath96-values at @xmath91 , a detection of the ground state contribution to",
    "the standard wilson loop at @xmath91 , where @xmath10 contains little @xmath1 admixture , is hopeless : one would have to resolve the correlation function at times of order @xmath97  fm ! for a complementary view on the problem , in the context of the breaking of higher representation strings in pure gauge theories , see e.g.  ref .  @xcite .",

    "obviously , precision studies at different @xmath99 and @xmath102 are needed to establish the validity range of this prediction .",
    "the decay of the adjoint potential into two gluelumps , where @xmath103 , also fits nicely into this context .    the quality of our density distribution data is depicted in figure  [ fig : transverse ] for the ground state at a separation slightly smaller than @xmath13 , as a function of the transverse distance @xmath67 from the @xmath2 axis . due to cancellations between the magnetic and electric components",
    "the energy density is much smaller than the action density : for the comparison we have multiplied the energy density data by the arbitrary factor of 29 .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath104 will diverge like @xmath105 in the continuum limit .",
    "the differences between the shapes of the energy and action density distributions are not statistically significant .",
    "below we only visualise the more precise action density results .",
    "we employ several off - axis separations . assuming rotational symmetry about the interquark axis , each point is labelled by two coordinates .",
    "@xmath67 denotes the distance from the @xmath2 axis and @xmath106 denotes the longitudinal distance from the centre point .",
    "we define an interpolating rectangular grid with perpendicular lattice spacing @xmath107 and the longitudinal spacing slightly scaled , such that the static sources always lie on integer grid coordinates .",
    "we then assign a quadratically interpolated value to each grid point @xmath108 , obtained from points in the neighbourhood , @xmath109 . on the axis the data points are more sparse and",
    "we relax the condition to @xmath110 while for the singular peaks we maintain the un - interpolated values .    in figures  [ fig : frame ] and [ fig :",
    "frame2 ] we display ground state action density distributions for different distances around @xmath13 .",
    "an mpeg animation has been published in ref .",
    "the colour encodes the relative statistical errors and the lattice mesh represents our spatial resolution @xmath107 . as already evident from the mixing angle @xmath111 of figure  [ fig : angle ] above , string breaking takes place within a small region around @xmath13 .",
    "all distributions are very similar to linear superpositions of string and broken - string states , with no non - trivial spatial dependence : string breaking appears to resemble an instantaneous process , without evidence of localisation of the @xmath17 pair creation .",
    "we wish to relate the static limit results to strong decay rates of quarkonia . in the non - relativistic limit of heavy quarks , potential `` models '' provide us with the natural framework for such studies .",
    "in fact at short distances , @xmath112 , potential `` models '' can be derived as an effective field theory , potential nrqcd , from qcd  @xcite .",
    "one can in principle add a @xmath4 sector , as well as transition terms between the two sectors , to the @xmath2 pnrqcd lagrangian .",
    "strong decays would then be a straightforward non - perturbative generalisation of the standard multipole treatment of radiative transitions in qed .",
    "unfortunately , transitions such as @xmath113 can hardly be classed as `` short distance '' physics .",
    "so , some modelling is required instead .",
    "the natural starting point again is a two channel potential model which might still have some validity beyond the short distance regime : @xmath114 with @xmath115 @xmath116 denotes the heavy quark mass and @xmath23 is the mass of a @xmath117 meson .",
    "the wavefunction has two components , @xmath118 and the potential is given by , @xmath119 where we have normalized the zero point energy to @xmath120 and @xmath121 rotates our fock basis @xmath122 into the eigenbasis @xmath123 .",
    "we neglect @xmath117-@xmath124 interactions and set @xmath125 .",
    "we further adjust the difference @xmath126 to the experimental value which affects our phase space factor .",
    "we then follow ref .",
    "@xcite and calculate the decay rate by multiplying phase space with the overlap integral between the @xmath127 wave function , the interaction term @xmath96 and the @xmath4 continuum . in doing so , we assume that the interaction does not contain any spatial distribution but only depends on the distance @xmath18 .",
    "this instantaneous picture is supported by our action density measurements above .",
    "+    in figure  [ fig : wave ] we display our radial @xmath127 wave function @xmath128 .",
    "the decay rate depends rather sensitively on the positions of the nodes .",
    "we obtain a preliminary result @xmath129 \\approx 5 $ ]  mev , which is about half the experimental value .",
    "this appears very reasonable , given the crudeness of the model and the fact that the gap @xmath25 will increase with lighter , more realistic sea quark masses .",
    "we are studying the situation and systematics in more detail .",
    "we were able to resolve the string breaking problem in @xmath0 qcd , at one value of the lattice spacing @xmath130  gev and of the sea quark mass , @xmath131 .",
    "it was also possible to study the dynamics of string breaking in detail and to resolve spatial colour field distributions .",
    "the breaking of the string appears to be an instantaneous process , with de - localized light quark pair creation .",
    "while a direct lattice study of strong decay rates such as @xmath132 or @xmath133 is at present virtually impossible , investigations in the static limit can help constraining models .",
    "studying the energy between pairs of static - light mesons can also be viewed as a milestone with respect to future calculations of @xmath134 forces , which are related to nucleon - nucleon interactions  @xcite .",
