    "following the seminal papers by leonhardt @xcite and pendry _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in 2006 , there has been great interest in the topic of cloaking , i.e. the elimination and control of scattering of waves by objects .",
    "there is extensive research on cloaking by diverting incident waves through a region exterior to an object .",
    "the object is shielded from the incident field rendering it invisible to an observer exterior to the cloaking region .",
    "this method of cloaking has been developed for acoustics , electromagnetism , elasticity and water waves , see for example @xcite@xcite .",
    "these are examples of passive cloaks , where properties of the cloak are designed such that cloaking is achieved for a particular set of conditions ; for changes in frequency and type of incident field , the cloak has to be redesigned .",
    "there also exists complementary research into active cloaking - a technique that involves several active devices located exterior to an object , which produce fields that cancel scattering from the object and produce small scattered fields themselves .",
    "the active devices are able to adapt to changes in both frequency and type of incident field .",
    "active cloaking techniques do not have the drawbacks , discussed by monticone & al @xcite and chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , associated with their passive counterparts .",
    "the method of active cloaking was investigated in the context of the two - dimensional laplace and helmholtz equations by guevara vasquez _",
    "@xcite@xcite , where it was shown that three active devices were required to successfully shield an object from an incident field .",
    "the devices were represented by multipolar point sources determined from green s formula and graf s addition theorem for hankel functions ( see @xcite ) .    the body of work by guevara vasquez _ et al . _",
    "inspired the recent papers by oneill _",
    "@xcite , investigating an analytical model for kirchhoff plates to cloak flexural waves scattered by a circular clamped void @xcite and a circular coated inclusion at resonant frequencies @xcite .",
    "the method outlined in these papers is generic and relies on cancelling selected multipole orders of the scattered field with an appropriate choice of active source amplitudes , calculated analytically via a linear algebraic system of equations .",
    "the active sources are represented by the green s function for the biharmonic operator , which has the additional advantageous property of being non - singular at the source point .",
    "the procedure outlined in these papers produces extremely efficient cloaking with only a small number of sources ( as little as six were sufficient in @xcite ) .",
    "here we draw a distinction between shielding and cloaking ; in both cases the ultimate aim is to ensure that an observer , exterior to the cloak , receives no information about the object s presence . in shielding problems , a quiet region surrounding the object",
    "is created where the wave field practically vanishes and in this region the object is virtually invisible . by focusing solely on the region exterior to the cloak and object , effective",
    "cloaking can still be achieved by ensuring that the total wave propagating away from the sources and object is sufficiently small .",
    "the method adopted in this paper , from @xcite and @xcite , is an example of cloaking as opposed to shielding .",
    "this active cloaking technique is analytical and does not have convergence issues within the active devices . following in the footsteps of guevara vasquez _",
    "_ @xcite@xcite and norris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , futhazar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented an inverse problem for finding source amplitudes required to cancel scattering from a finite region within a kirchhoff plate , including a discussion of the errors associated with the order of truncation for specific numerical examples .",
    "previous work by oneill _",
    "@xcite , @xcite has only dealt with active cloaking in kirchhoff plates for a single continuous object .",
    "it is therefore a natural extension to consider the active cloaking of a discrete structure in the form of a finite cluster of scatterers . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first instance where a finite cluster is cloaked using active sources ; a finite cluster is of interest as there can be multiple scattering , and highly directional anisotropy can be induced within the cluster and this is representative of real systems that might need to be cloaked .",
    "there has also been related extensive research employing discrete structures as the cloaking mechanism .",
    "for example , colquitt _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite use a discrete system of rods and point masses to approximate a regularised continuum square - shaped cloak .",
    "effective cloaking was demonstrated for solutions to the helmholtz equation in the low frequency regime . in optics , the paper by nicorovici _",
    "@xcite uses passive techniques in the context of plasmonic metamaterials to cloak a finite cluster of cylinders .",
    "the authors derive a method for calculating the relative local density of states describing how a source interacts with a finite system of @xmath3 coated cylinders .",
    "they demonstrate that cloaking can be achieved exterior to a system of three cylinders by coating them with a material chosen to have properties ensuring plasmonic resonance occurs in the quasi - static limit ; the cloaking method described in @xcite is an example of passive cloaking in optics .",
    "inspired by photonic and phononic crystals , there has been great recent interest in the study of platonic crystals , which use the kirchhoff theory to model flexural vibrations of a thin elastic plate patterned with a periodic array of scatterers .",
    "the simplest type of scatterer is a rigid pin , and many publications have featured various associated problems , producing a rich resource of literature on pinned plate systems .",
    "this motivated us to cloak a discrete structure of pins in this article .",
    "infinite periodic structured plates pinned at regular points were studied by mace ( see , for example , @xcite ) , with much of this earlier work reviewed by mead @xcite ; the assumption of clamped pins allows for an exact solution for a periodic square array using a fourier series method , which has been adopted more recently by antonakakis & craster in a collection of papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "dispersion surfaces and band diagrams are used to predict a variety of interesting wave phenomena , including shielding , lensing and negative refraction @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach using multipole methods has been employed by mcphedran , movchan & movchan in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "multipole expansions , consisting of sums of cylindrical bessel functions , are ideally suited to solve problems involving periodic arrays of finite - radius cylindrical holes . for zero displacement boundary conditions , in the limit as the radius of the voids vanishes , we recover the case of rigid pins .",
    "dispersion surfaces and band diagrams ( see for example , movchan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , mcphedran _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) are consistent with those obtained for the fourier series approach .",
    "the bloch - floquet analysis of infinite periodic systems also provides insight in the form of approximate ranges of frequencies for resonances in finite clusters of these periodic arrays ( see , for example , antonakakis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , mcphedran _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    for arrays of infinite gratings , one may employ an elegant methodology for exploring rayleigh - bloch modes ( movchan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , poulton _",
    "@xcite , haslinger _",
    "@xcite ) to identify localisation regimes and wave - trapping behaviour for scattering problems . by tuning the frequency of the system , the gratings act like fabry - prot plates where repeated reflections lead to constructive interference and localisation .",
    "the associated eigenvalue problem yields the bloch modes linked with these resonance regimes for specified angles of incident plane waves .",
    "@xcite give a table of optimised frequencies for a range of incident angles @xmath4 , which is relevant both to finite numbers of gratings , and to finite clusters like those studied here .",
    "this green s function approach ( also employed by evans & porter @xcite , linton & martin @xcite , foldy @xcite ) leads to rapid numerical solutions , determining propagating frequencies for pinned clusters , that we seek to cloak in this article .",
    "the concepts of dirac cone dispersion and dirac points originate in topological insulators and have more recently been transferred into photonics @xcite .",
    "they are associated with adjacent bands , for which electrons obey the schrdinger equation , that meet at a single point .",
    "typically connected with hexagonal and triangular geometries in systems governed by maxwell s equations , and most notably associated with the electronic transport properties of graphene @xcite , analogous dirac and dirac - like points have recently been observed in photonic and phononic crystals .",
    "even more recently , similar properties have been demonstrated for platonic crystals by smith _",
    "_ @xcite and mcphedran _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the existence of dirac cones and dirac points are generally associated with the symmetries of the geometry of the system .",
    "when two perfect cones meet at a point , with linear dispersion , the cones are said to touch at a dirac point . in the vicinity of a dirac point , electrons propagate like waves in free space , unimpeded by the microstructure of the crystal . in platonic crystals ,",
    "the analogous points generally possess a triple degeneracy , where the two dirac - like cones are joined by another flat surface passing through what is known as a dirac - like point .",
    "this is analogous to the photonic terminology adopted by mei _",
    "@xcite where the existence of linear dispersions near the @xmath5 point of the reciprocal lattice for the square array is the result of  accidental \" degeneracy of a doubly degenerate mode and a single mode . sometimes known as a  perturbed \" dirac point",
    ", the accidental degeneracy does not arise purely from the lattice symmetry ( as for a dirac point ) but from a perturbation of the physical parameters , for example varying the radius of the inclusions ( see antonakakis _",

    "a detailed discussion on the broadband nature of our cloaking method , with the emphasis on choosing specific values of the spectral parameter from relevant band diagrams and dispersion surfaces for a thin plate pinned in a doubly periodic fashion , is in section [ broadband_cloaking ] .",
    "finally , in section [ results ] , we present illustrative examples of effective cloaking for various spectral parameter values ; for higher frequencies , where the cluster generates a more complicated scattering pattern , we clarify the transition from locating the active control sources on the grid of the cluster to a circle surrounding the cluster , and demonstrate the advantages of this latter configuration .",
