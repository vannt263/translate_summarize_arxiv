    "the ensuing years after the first reported transport measurements of isolated graphene flakes have witnessed an intense debate on the origin of the _ quasi_-universal value of the minimal conductivity @xmath0 . the fact that experimental confirmations of the celebrated universal minimal conductivity @xmath1 , expected for ideal graphene , are the exception@xcite rather than the rule and that most graphene samples present larger values , typically @xmath4 , regardless of varying experimental conditions@xcite , remains one the major fundamental unresolved questions in graphene physics .",
    "although this issue has spurred a vast amount of theoretical work@xcite , to date , the answer remains elusive and no theory has been able to render a full picture of this jigsaw puzzle .",
    "numerical@xcite as well as analytical work@xcite for simple models of disorder and non - interacting electrons indicate that , as long as intervalley scattering is avoided , single - parameter scaling applies .",
    "this means that a beta function @xmath5 exists , where @xmath6 is the size of the sample . in particular , @xmath7 , behaving as @xmath8 for @xmath9 . in other words ,",
    "neutral graphene would not present a metal - insulator transition , being its conductivity bounded from below by the universal value @xmath10 for ideal graphene and unbounded from above ( @xmath9 ) as the disorder is increased .",
    "this prediction ultimately relies on the expectation that intervalley scattering is not activated for most common types of ( long - ranged ) disorder and relevant length scales , a fact confirmed by some atomistic simulations@xcite , but questioned by others@xcite .",
    "alternatively , there have been efforts to consider likely sources of disorder such as nearby charged impurities@xcite , ripples@xcite , and resonant scatterers@xcite in the most possible realistic manner .",
    "this usually comes at the expense of a rigourous quantum mechanical treatment of transport which renders @xmath0 size independent@xcite .",
    "a number of predictions can be made in these semiclassical aproaches , having in common , e.g. , the fact that @xmath0 always decreases with increasing impurity concentration @xmath11 in addition to not being bounded from above as @xmath12 .",
    "this is at odds with the theoretical predictions mentioned in the previous paragraph and hardly agrees with available experimental evidence@xcite",
    ". the inherent limitations of semiclassical approaches have been recently appreciated@xcite and are at the heart of the discrepancy .",
    "one can not deny , however , the insight gained on the actual microscopic origin of the minimal conductivity from a realistic treatment of disorder .",
    "combining a full quantum mechanical approach to transport with a realistic description of disorder and screening seems to be the only way to resolve the controversy and this is our major contribution in this work .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "( i ) first , our calculations corroborate previous theoretical work and agree with experimental findings such as the observed linear behavior of the conductivity with electron density as well as the observed different mobilities for electrons and holes .",
    "( ii ) second , charged impurities prevail over ripples in the experimentally relevant range of impurity concentrations and distances to the graphene flake , increasing the clean - limit conductivity .",
    "( v ) finally , this increase is limited to a small percentage of the clean - limit value for small systems , which , in combination with the logarithmic scaling law predicted in the absence of intervalley scattering , allows us to explain the narrow range of values @xmath3 of the observed graphene minimal conductivity .",

    "we consider a model for graphene where the c atoms are replaced by hydrogenic atoms .",
    "the @xmath13 orbitals of the c atoms , responsible for the low energy physics , are represented by the @xmath14 orbitals of the hydrogenic atoms , which , in turn , are approximated by a gaussian function .",
    "the gaussian exponent is optimized to reproduce the low - energy band structure of real graphene when both are computed in the local density approximation ( lda ) as implemented in gaussian03@xcite [ see fig .",

    "we are interested in the conductivity , defined through @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the conductance of finite hydrophene ribbons of width @xmath17 along the zigzag direction ( @xmath18 ) and length @xmath6 along the armchair direction ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the latter coincides here with the direction of the current which is driven by metallic electrodes contacted along the width of the ribbons as shown in fig .",
    "[ preliminar](a ) .",
    "the metallic electrodes are modeled by a bidimensional tight - binding bethe lattice of coordination three and only nearest - neighbors hopping where the six crystallographic directions coincide with those of the ribbon ( see inset ) .",

    "[ preliminar](c ) ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ preliminar](a ) , a branch of the bethe lattice is connected to each undercoordinated atom on the zigzag edge .",
    "the minimal conductivity ( defined in the limit @xmath21 ) depends on the particular choice for the electrode model , but never exceeds the universal value @xmath22@xcite for ideal graphene .",
    "we have chosen here metallic ribbons , i.e. , those that , when their electronic structure is computed at the simplest nearest - neighbors tight - binding model , this does not present a gap for @xmath23 .",
    "the results do not depend either on this choice or the direction of the injected current .",
    "we consider here two types of disorder currently accepted to possibly influence the mobility and the minimal conductivity of graphene : charged impurities and ripples .",
    "the model for the ripples consists of a randomly generated position - dependent height function given by the equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of fourier components ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 is the parameter that accounts for the overall deviation from planarity which is chosen as to reproduce typical ripple height - to - size ratios in the order of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are random reciprocal wave vectors where @xmath31 is the graphene lattice constant .",
    "since in the hydrophene model there is only one spherical orbital per site , changes in height only affect the hopping between atoms ( and the overlap ) , creating an accompanying pseudo - magnetic field landscape@xcite which does not affect the charge density distribution . to account for changes in the on - site energies due to the @xmath32 rehybridization in real graphene ,",
    "we have considered a scalar potential of the type @xmath33@xcite , where @xmath34 is chosen as to reproduce potential fluctuations in the order of a few tens of mev@xcite .",
    "an example of the corrugation and lda induced charge is shown in fig .",
    "[ ripples ] .        for simplicity in the analysis of the results , we consider @xmath35 impurities randomly distributed in the same plane at a distance @xmath36 off the hydrophene ribbon .",
    "this is probably a good assumption since charged impurities are expected to be located near the surface of the sio@xmath37 substrate or in between the surface and the graphene flake or even adsorbed on the graphene flake , depending on their specific origin",
    ". figure [ density ] shows the screening charge density for various representative disorder realizations of charged impurities at different distances off the graphene plane .",
    "starting at @xmath38  , a landscape of electron - hole puddles gives way to strongly localized screening charge around each impurity as @xmath39 .",
    "this screening charge approaches the @xmath40function predicted by effective models@xcite , although regularized by the finite value of @xmath36 and by the lattice constant of our atomistic model .",
    "figure [ potential ] shows the accompanying kohn - sham potential .",
    "the range of the potential induced by a single impurity can be as small as @xmath41 nm and the depth as high as 2 ev for @xmath42  . which , in principle , can induce strong intervalley scattering@xcite .",
    "electron - hole puddles are also induced by the ripples due to changes in second - neighbor hopping , rehybridization , and local changes in exchange interactions@xcite , but the average induced electronic density is still typically one order of magnitude smaller than the one induced by impurities at @xmath38  .",
