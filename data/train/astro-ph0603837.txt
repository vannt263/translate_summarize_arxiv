    "a key physical property of extragalactic radio jets is the relationship between the energy stored in the radiating particles and the energy stored in the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite originally suggested that these energies were approximately in balance , or equipartition , as a way of minimizing the total energy stored in extended radio lobes , and more recent work @xcite has indeed shown that extended radio lobes are at or very near equipartition .",
    "however , it is still unknown whether this balance is established at , or close to , the base of the jet , or if jets begin far out of equipartition and only reach equipartition after significant periods of time .",
    "the energy balance at the base of extragalactic radio jets can be studied by measuring the brightness temperature of jet cores using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "the intrinsic brightness temperature , @xmath3 , is related to the energy balance via the following expression @xcite :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the ratio of the energy densities of the radiating particles , @xmath6 , to the magnetic field , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 k is the equipartition brightness temperature defined by @xcite , and the exponent of @xmath9 assumes an power - law lorentz factor distribution for the radiating particles with index @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to a spectral index of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in the optically thin parts of the jet .",
    "the intrinsic brightness temperatures of agn cores are limited either by the inverse - compton catastrophe to be @xmath14 k @xcite or by the possibility that jets are near equipartition to begin with , so @xmath15 @xcite . if agn cores are instead limited by the inverse - compton catastrophe , they must be very far out of equipartition with @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to measure intrinsic brightness temperatures because agn jets are highly relativistic and therefore doppler boosted . so with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi )",
    ", we do not measure the @xmath3 directly , but rather the observed brightness temperature ) due to optical depth effects .",
    "our choice of cosmology is @xmath17 km / s / mpc , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the doppler factor of the jet , given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the speed of the relativistic flow in units of the speed of light , and @xmath24 is the angle the jet makes with the line of sight .",
    "the speed of the jet is often characterized by its bulk lorentz factor , @xmath25 .    observed brightness temperatures from ground - based vlbi can range up to lower limits of @xmath26 k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observed brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath27 k have been reported with space vlbi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find typical observed brightness temperatures in the range of @xmath28 k to @xmath29 k from the vsop 5 ghz survey , and @xcite find a similar range from ground - based vlba measurements at 15 ghz .",
    "the recent discovery of very nearby scintillation screens has brought the maximum brightness temperatures deduced from intra - day variability ( idv ) into the same range as those measured through vlbi even though interstellar scintillation is potentially sensitive to much smaller angular sizes than the vlba ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in this paper , we present a new method for deducing the typical intrinsic brightness temperature for parsec - scale agn cores from a population of well studied vlba jets .",
    "these cores represent the optically thick region at the start of the jet as seen in vlbi images .",
    "we combine observed brightness temperature data from @xcite and proper motion data from the 2 cm survey ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in  [",
    "s : theory ] we discuss the theory behind our approach , and in ",
    "[ s : res ] we present our results and discuss the implications for energy balance between particles and magnetic fields at the base of agn jets .",
    "the basis of our approach is to compare the observed brightness temperatures , @xmath30 , for a collection of parsec - scale agn jet cores with the proper motions of their jets , @xmath31 .",
    "proper motion , @xmath32 , will serve as a proxy for the jet doppler factor , @xmath21 , which we can not easily measure .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , we will assume that the speeds of the fastest jet components are the same as the flow speed through the jet core .",
    "we will also assume the jets are straight , with no bends between the jet core and the location of jet components .",
    "to the degree that these assumptions are incorrect , we should expect some scatter in our final results .    to generate a simple model ,",
    "we make two further assumptions : ( 1 ) that all jets in our sample have the same intrinsic brightness temperature , @xmath3 , and ( 2 ) that all sources are close to the critical angle , @xmath33 , for the maximal superluminal motion at a given @xmath23 . under these strict assumptions , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and",
    "therefore @xmath31 is a simple function of the observed brightness temperature , as represented by the solid line in figure 1 .",
    "of course , the assumption that all jets are near the critical angle is poor . for a flux - limited sample",
    ", the majority will lie inside the critical angle where the doppler factor exceeds the lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution for jet orientations in a beamed , flux - limited sample has been studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite . in figure 1 , @xmath31 is plotted versus @xmath30 from a numerical simulation of a flux - limited sample of 1000 agn jets .",
    "this simulation is based on @xcite and assumes that all jets have the same intrinsic brightness temperature @xmath36 k. the jet speeds in the population range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , and are distributed according to @xmath39 .",
    "these simulated jets are drawn from a randomly - oriented parent population with an intrinsic ( unbeamed ) luminosity function consistent with fr - ii radio galaxies described in @xcite .",
    "the luminosity function has a lower cutoff at @xmath40 , and incorporates pure exponential luminosity evolution while maintaining a constant co - moving space density out to @xmath41 .",
    "approximately 75% of the sources in figure 1 fall below and to the right of the solid line representing the critical angle ; these sources are inside the critical angle , and while they have large doppler factors , many of them are close enough to the line of sight to have small proper motions .",
    "the dotted line in figure 1 shows the apparent speed for a jet with the maximal lorentz factor of @xmath38 in the simulation as a function of @xmath30 , corresponding to a varying jet viewing angle .",
    "the dotted line , therefore , represents an upper envelope for the simulation .",
    "the scatter in figure 1 gives a realistic idea of what we might expect for a `` best case '' correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath30 for real data under the assumptions that jets are straight , pattern speeds @xmath42 flow speeds , and all jets have the same @xmath3 .",
    "however , even with the scatter induced by selection effects , the trend is clear , particularly the lack of sources with _ both _ low observed brightness temperature _ and _ fast proper motion .",
    "we have collected multi - epoch brightness temperature measurements for 106 sources that all have well studied proper motions and at least 5 epochs of brightness temperature measurements .",
    "the brightness temperature measurements are taken from @xcite , and the proper motion measurements are updated from @xcite to include additional epochs from the vlba 2 cm survey through 2002 ( e. ros et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "as described in @xcite we use the fastest proper motion for each source , and we only consider those motions that are ranked as `` excellent '' ( e ) or `` good '' ( g ) by the criteria laid out in that paper . of the 106 sources plotted here , 70 are members of the 133 source , flux - limited mojave sample @xcite .",
    "the remaining 35 sources are members of the 2 cm survey , but do not meet the selection criteria of the mojave program .",
    "figure 2 is a three panel plot of @xmath31 vs @xmath30 .",
    "figure 2a contains 106 fictional sources from the simulation plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the 106 fictional sources are selected in a manner analogous to our actual data , with 70 of them chosen at random from the 133 brightest sources in the simulation and the remaining 36 chosen at random from the rest .",
    "this panel is included to illustrate that selection criteria similar to our real sample will still produce a plot very similar to figure 1 with about 75% of the points falling below and to the right of the solid line representing sources at the critical angle . as in figure 1",
    ", the dotted line in each panel is the apparent speed for a jet with a bulk lorentz factor of 30 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "if all sources had the same @xmath3 and none had @xmath43 , the dotted line would encompass all of the sources .",
    "figure 2b is a plot of @xmath31 versus the maximum observed brightness temperature for each source in our real sample .",
    "the solid line represents sources at the critical angle which have @xmath44 k , and the same value for @xmath3 is used in calculating the dotted `` envelope . ''",
    "this value of @xmath3 was chosen so that approximately 75% of the sources would fall below and to the right of the solid line ; thus matching our expectation from the simulation .",
    "figure 2c is a similar plot except that it shows sources in their median - low state , what we call the `` 25% median '' .",
    "this 25% median is the median of the lowest half of the brightness temperature observations for a given source . in this way ,",
    "the 25%-median represents a typical low brightness state for each source .",
    "the @xmath45% line for the 25%-median values is @xmath46 k. a more detailed fit of our data to the distribution of simulation points in figure 2a is beyond the scope of this paper , and we note that other reasonable choices for the simulation parameters described in section [ s : theory ] will give a roughly similar distribution of points and are likely to yield fractions between 60% and 80% of sources within the critical angle .",
    "for a 60% fraction , we would have deduced @xmath47 for the maximum case and @xmath48 k for the median - low case .",
    "it is interesting that plotting @xmath31 versus @xmath30 in figures 2b and 2c produces a trend very similar to that seen in the simulation , although with more scatter .",
    "there is clearly a lack of sources with _ both _ low observed brightness temperature _ and _ fast proper motion .",
    "the fact that the trend is still clear here implies that both plots are described by a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperature , centered on the value chosen for the solid line in each plot .",
    "if the scatter in the 25%-median and maximum plots is due to intrinsic brightness temperature alone , we estimate the real range of intrinsic brightness temperature in each case extends down to about 50% of the @xmath3 for the plotted line and up to about twice this value . note",
    "that this means the intrinsic brightness temperature ranges for the 25%-median and maximum cases do not overlap .",
    "real sources appear to be in a distinctly different state when they display their maximum brightness temperatures .",
    "we note that the apparent increase in brightness temperature between the 25%-median and maximum states can not be attributed to changes in the jet doppler factors , which we have assumed to be constant in time , because the necessary large changes in doppler factor would produce much larger changes in the flux densities of the jet cores ( @xmath49 ) which are not observed .",
    "the maximum plot contains more lower limits than measurements , so the characteristic value of @xmath3 should really be taken as a lower limit on the characteristic value .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 k when sources display their maximum brightness temperature . by equation 1",
    ", this requires sources in that state to be well out of equipartition , with @xmath51 or greater . on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic value for the median - low state is much closer to the equipartition brightness temperature defined by @xcite , and there are far fewer limits in that plot . ]",
    ", so it seems reasonable to take the characteristic median - low intrinsic brightness temperature to be @xmath52 k.    our data indicate that agn jet cores are indeed near equipartition in their median - low state ; however they go well out of equipartition in their maximum brightness temperature state . in their maximum state",
    "they have @xmath53 times the energy in their radiating particles as they have in the magnetic fields .",
    "such a large imbalance may be the result of injection or acceleration of particles at the base of the jet , resulting in a transient state that is in excess of the equilibrium equipartition brightness temperature . for @xmath54 , equation 5 from @xcite predicts a particle number density which has increased by a factor of 400 and a magnetic field strength which has decreased by a factor of 15 compared to the equilibrium value .",
    "we emphase that these values are only approximate as the precise balance between particle and field energy is a sensitive function of brightness temperature ( see equation 1 ) .",
    "what is robust , is that the jets in our sample have a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures in their median - low state , and the brightness temperatures in their maximum state are nearly an order of magnitude ( or more ) larger , indicating a much higher particle to field energy ratio .",
    "it is interesting to note that the narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures when sources are in their median - low state means we can derive doppler factors for most sources which are good to a factor of two or better by assuming @xmath55 k for the 25%-median observed value .",
    "then @xmath56 k. this is very similar to the equipartition doppler factor suggested by @xcite and @xcite ; however , by using the 25%-median observed brightness temperature we get a much more reliable estimate for the doppler factor .",
    "doppler factors derived from single epoch brightness temperature measurments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are likely to have a large degree of scatter as it is clear from this work that the intrinsic brightness temperatures of sources can vary by an order of magnitude or more . additionally , doppler factors derived from outburst events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are likely to be systematically overestimated if it is assumed that sources are near equipartition during these events .",
