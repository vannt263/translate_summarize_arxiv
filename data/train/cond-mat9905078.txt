    "according to the universality hypothesis , critical phenomena can be described by quantities that do not depend on the microscopic details of a system , but only on global properties such as the dimensionality and the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "many three - dimensional systems characterized by short - range interactions and a scalar order parameter ( such as density or uniaxial magnetization ) belong to the ising universality class .",
    "this implies that the critical exponents , as well as other universal quantities , are the same for all these models .",
    "their precise determination is therefore important in order to test the universality hypothesis .",
    "the high - temperature ( ht ) expansion is one of the most effective approaches to the study of critical phenomena .",
    "much work ( even recently ) has been devoted to the computation of ht series , especially for @xmath6-vector models and in particular the ising model .",
    "an important issue in the analysis of the ht series is related to the presence of non - analytic corrections to the leading power - law behavior .",
    "for instance , according to the renormalization group theory ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the magnetic susceptibility should behave as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the reduced temperature .",
    "the leading critical exponent @xmath9 , and the correction exponents @xmath10 , are universal , while the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are non - universal and should depend smoothly on any subsidiary parameter that may change @xmath13 , but does not affect the nature of the transition .",
    "non - analytic correction terms to the leading power - law behavior , represented by noninteger powers of @xmath14 , are related to the presence of irrelevant operators . for three - dimensional ising - like systems",
    "the existence of leading corrections described by @xmath15 is well established . in order to obtain precise estimates of the critical parameters ,",
    "the approximants of the ht series should properly allow for the confluent non - analytic corrections @xcite .",
    "the so - called integral approximants @xcite can , in principle , allow for them ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . however , they require long series to detect non - leading effects , and in practice they need to be biased to work well .",
    "analyses meant to effectively allow for confluent corrections are generally based on biased approximants where the value of @xmath16 and the first non - analytic exponent @xmath17 is given ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "it is indeed expected that the leading non - analytic correction is the dominant source of systematic error .",
    "an alternative approach to this problem is the construction of a ht expansion where the dominant confluent correction is suppressed .",
    "if the leading non - analytic terms are not anymore present in the expansion , the analysis technique based on integral approximants should become much more effective , since the main source of systematic error has been eliminated . in order to obtain an improved high - temperature ( iht ) expansion , we may consider improved hamiltonians characterized by a vanishing coupling with the irrelevant operator responsible for the leading scaling corrections .",
    "this idea has been pursued by chen , fisher , and nickel @xcite , who studied classes of two - parameter models ( such as the bcc scalar double - gaussian and klauder models ) .",
    "such models interpolate between the spin-@xmath18 ising model and the gaussian model , and they are all expected to belong to the ising universality class .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that improved models with suppressed leading corrections to scaling can be obtained by tuning the parameters ( see also refs .",
    "this approach has been recently considered in the context of monte carlo simulations @xcite , using lattice @xmath19 models .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the recent work @xcite of belohorec and nickel in the context of dilute polymers , where a substantial improvement in the determination of the critical exponents @xmath20 and @xmath21 was achieved by simulating the two - parameter domb - joyce model .",
    "we consider the class of scalar models defined on the simple cubic lattice by the hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 indicates nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath25 are real variables , and @xmath26 is a generic potential ( satisfying appropriate stability constraints ) .",
    "the critical limit of these models is expected to belong to the ising universality class ( apart from special cases corresponding to multicritical points ) . using the linked cluster expansion technique , we calculated the high - temperature expansion to 20th order for an arbitrary potential , generalizing the existing expansions for the standard ising model ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of the existing ht calculations ) . in this work",
    "we will essentially consider and present results for a potential of the form @xmath27 such a potential will be assumed in the following , unless otherwise stated . within this family of potentials , improved hamiltonians can be obtained by looking for values of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 for which leading scaling corrections are suppressed . in particular we may keep @xmath29 fixed and look for the corresponding value @xmath30 of @xmath28 that produces an improved hamiltonian .",
    "notice that , for generic choices of the hamiltonian , @xmath30 may not exist .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath31 @xmath19 theory with nearest - neighbor couplings on a cubic lattice in the large-@xmath6 limit , where it is impossible to find a positive value of @xmath28 achieving the suppression of the dominant scaling corrections . using the estimates of the leading scaling correction amplitudes reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can argue that the same is true for finite @xmath32 . as shown numerically by monte carlo simulations @xcite",
    ", @xmath30 exists in the case @xmath33 , which is the single - component @xmath19 model ( i.e.  the model presented above with @xmath34 ) . by using finite - size techniques",

    "we will also consider the spin-1 ( or blume - capel ) hamiltonian @xmath36 where the variables @xmath37 take the values @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath39 for which the leading scaling corrections are suppressed is @xmath40  @xcite .    from the point of view of the ht expansion technique ,",
    "the main problem is the determination of the improved hamiltonian . once the improved hamiltonian is available , the analysis of its ht series leads , as we shall see , to much cleaner and therefore reliable results . a precise estimate of the parameters associated with an improved hamiltonian is crucial in order to obtain a substantial improvement of the iht results . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , monte carlo simulations using finite - size scaling techniques seem to provide the most efficient tool for this purpose . for comparison , in the case of the pure @xmath19 theory ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "our best estimate of @xmath30 from the ht expansion is consistent with the above - mentioned monte carlo result @xmath35 , but it is affected by an uncertainty of about 10% ( see sec .",

    "the comparison of the results obtained from the three improved hamiltonians considered strongly supports our working hypothesis of the reduction of systematic errors in the iht estimates , and provides an estimate of the residual errors due to the subleading confluent corrections to scaling .",
    "the analysis of our 20th order iht series allows us to obtain very precise estimates of the critical exponents @xmath9 , @xmath20 and @xmath44 .",
    "our estimates substantially improve previous determinations by ht or other methods .",
    "we extended our study to the small - field expansion of the effective potential , which is the helmholtz free energy of the model .",
    "this expansion can be parametrized in terms of the zero - momentum @xmath45-point couplings @xmath46 in the symmetric phase .",
    "the analysis of the iht series provides new results for the couplings @xmath46 , and leads to interesting comparisons with the estimates from other approaches based on field theory and lattice techniques .",
    "moreover we improved the knowledge of the universal critical low - momentum behavior of the two - point function of the order parameter , which is relevant for critical scattering phenomena .    by exploiting the known analytic properties of the critical equation of state",
    ", one may reconstruct the full critical equation of state from the small - field expansion of the effective potential , which is related to the behavior of the equation of state for small magnetization in the symmetric phase .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , we will work with `` improved '' hamiltonians , i.e.  with models in which the leading correction to scaling has a vanishing ( in practice very small ) amplitude .    to clarify the basic idea ,",
    "let us consider a model with two relevant operators ( the thermal and the magnetic ones ) and one irrelevant operator .",

    "the non - linear scaling fields @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are analytic functions of the parameters appearing in the hamiltonian , and therefore we can write @xmath72 , \\\\ \\mu   & = & g_{1\\mu } ( \\lambda ) + t g_{2\\mu } ( \\lambda ) +            h^2 g_{3\\mu } ( \\lambda ) + o(t^2 , t h^2 , h^4 ) , \\label{mu - expansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 . substituting these expressions into eq .",

    "notice that it is often assumed that the regular part of the free energy does not depend on @xmath68 .",
    "if this were the case , we would have @xmath79 . however ,",
