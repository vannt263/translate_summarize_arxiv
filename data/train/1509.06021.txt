    "for a complete minimal surface in euclidean space , an inequality stronger than the classical inequality of cohn - vossen holds , giving a lower bound for the total absolute curvature .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether there is a minimal surface which attains this minimum value for the total absolute curvature .",
    "we consider this problem and contribute to the theory of existence of minimal surfaces in euclidean space .",
    "our work connects with the bjrling problem for minimal surfaces in euclidean space .",
    "let @xmath0 be a minimal immersion of a @xmath1-manifold @xmath2 into euclidean 3-space @xmath3 , and we usually call @xmath4 a _ minimal surface _ in @xmath3 .",
    "choosing isothermal coordinates makes @xmath2 a riemann surface , and then @xmath4 is called a _ conformal minimal immersion_.",
    "the following representation formula is one of the basic tools in the theory of minimal surfaces :    [ th : w - rep ] let @xmath5 be a pair of a meromorphic function @xmath6 and a holomorphic differential @xmath7 on a riemann surface @xmath2 so that @xmath8 gives a riemannian metric on @xmath2 .",
    "we set @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "assume that @xmath11 then @xmath12 defines a conformal minimal immersion .",
    "the first fundamental form @xmath17 and the second fundamental form @xmath18 of the surface are given by @xmath19 moreover , @xmath20 coincides with the composition of the gauss map @xmath21 of the minimal surface and stereographic projection @xmath22 , that is , @xmath23 .",
    "so we call @xmath6 the gauss map of the minimal surface .        1",
    ".   @xmath2 is conformally equivalent to a compact riemann surface @xmath24 of genus @xmath25 punctured at a finite number of points @xmath26 .",
    "the gauss map @xmath6 extends to a holomorphic mapping @xmath27 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior around each end @xmath28 can be described by the order of the poles of @xmath29 in theorem  [ th : w - rep ] at @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the order of the pole of @xmath32 at @xmath28 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "condition yields @xmath35 , and thus @xmath36 .",
    "the following theorem shows the geometric properties of @xmath37 , which includes a stronger inequality than the cohn - vossen inequality :    [ th : oss - ineq ] let @xmath0 be a minimal surface as in theorem  [ th : huber - osserman ] .",
    "+ ( a ) the immersion @xmath4 is proper .",
    "+ ( b ) if @xmath38 is the sphere of radius @xmath39 , then @xmath40 consists of @xmath41 closed curves @xmath42 in @xmath43 which converge @xmath44 to closed geodesics @xmath45 of @xmath43 , with multiplicities @xmath46 , as @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , @xmath48 and equality holds if and only if each end is embedded .",
    "moreover , a relation between the total ( absolute ) curvature and the degree of @xmath6 is as follows .",
    "note that since @xmath6 extends to a holomorphic map @xmath49 from a compact riemann surface @xmath24 to a compact riemann surface @xmath50 , we can define the degree of @xmath6 by @xmath51 .",
    "since the gaussian curvature of a minimal surface @xmath52 is always non - positive , its total absolute curvature @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 recall that the total absolute curvature of a minimal surface in @xmath3 is just the area under the gauss map @xmath55 , that is , @xmath56 ( see , for example , ( 3.11 ) in @xcite for details . )",
    "hence is rewritten as @xmath57 and we consider sharpness of the inequality .         for @xmath60 , we can prove the existence of the surface rigorously .",
    "however , for other cases , since the surface does not have enough symmetry , the rigorous proof of the existence still remains an open problem .",
    "our work is devoted to minimal surfaces satisfying @xmath61 . on the other hand , it is important to consider the existence of non - orientable minimal surfaces with @xmath62 .",
    "now , we review non - orientable minimal surfaces in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath63 be a minimal immersion of a non - orientable surface into @xmath3 .",
    "then the oriented two sheeted covering space @xmath2 of @xmath64 naturally inherits a riemann surface structure and we have a canonical projection @xmath65 .",
    "we can also define a map @xmath66 such that @xmath67 , which is an antiholomorphic involution on @xmath2 without fixed points . here",
    "@xmath64 can be identified with @xmath68 . in this way , if @xmath0 is a conformal minimal surface and there is an antiholomorphic involution @xmath66 without fixed points so that @xmath69 , then we can define a non - orientable minimal surface @xmath70 .",
    "conversely , every non - orientable minimal surface is obtained in this procedure .",
    "suppose that @xmath70 is complete and of finite total curvature .",
    "then , we can apply theorems  [ th : huber - osserman ] and [ th : oss - ineq ] to the conformal minimal immersion @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we have a stronger restriction on the topology of @xmath64 or @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , meeks @xcite showed that the euler characteristic @xmath71 and @xmath72 are congruent modulo @xmath73 , where @xmath6 is the gauss map of @xmath4 . by these facts",
    ", we can observe that for every complete non - orientable minimal surface of finite total curvature , @xmath74 holds .",
    "for @xmath75 and @xmath60 , meeks mbius strip @xcite and lpez klein bottle @xcite satisfy @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "but , for @xmath77 , no examples with @xmath76 are known .",
    "so , it is interesting to give a minimal surface satisfying @xmath62 with an antiholomorphic involution without fixed points .",
    "this problem appeared in @xcite and @xcite .",
