    "in sect.3.3 we analyzed the velocity structure of the 12.81@xmath0 m [ ne ii ] and 15.56@xmath0 m [ ne iii ] lines in irasf001837111 and compared the results to those of studies of its optical and near - infrared forbidden lines .",
    "this revealed that the mid - infrared neon emission lines have strongly blue shifted components not detected in both the optical 5007  [ o iii ] and near - infrared 1.644@xmath0 m [ fe ii ] line profiles .",
    "given the mid - infrared spectral evidence for strong obscuration in the nucleus of irasf001837111 @xcite , the simplest explanation for the absence of strongly blue shifted gas components in the optical and near - infrared emission lines is extinction .",
    "we estimate the required extinction by assuming line emission at any wavelength @xmath46 to be effectively suppressed by a specific extinction a(@xmath46)@xmath392 .",
    "the level of screen extinction required to obscure the high - velocity components of the 5007   [ o iii ] line then amounts to a@xmath47 = a@xmath2@xmath252 . if the same screen is responsible for obscuring the high - velocity components of the 1.644@xmath0 m [ fe ii ] line , the required extinction increases to a@xmath2@xmath2510 ( a@xmath48@xmath252 ) . then to still be able to see the strongly blue shifted 12.81@xmath0 m [ ne ii ] emission through this screen , the maximum extinction is constrained to a@xmath2@xmath1750 ( a@xmath49@xmath171 ) .",
    "this implies a column density of the obscuring screen of n@xmath50 = 210 @xmath9 10@xmath51 @xmath37 , assuming n@xmath50 = 1.9 @xmath9 10@xmath52 @xmath9 a@xmath2 .    in the absence of spatial information for the mid - infrared neon line emission",
    ", the location of the screen blocking the optical and near - infrared line emission can not be determined with any certainty . however",
    ", it is plausible for the screen to be situated at the base of the outflow traced in 5007  [ o iii ] . the observed strong decrease in blueshift of the 5007   [ o iii ] line from 3@xmath22 to 0@xmath22 east of the nucleus ( fig.12 of * ?",
    "* ) may hence indicate that the material that obscures the most highly disturbed optical ( but not mid - infrared ) line emission is located within the inner 10kpc .",
    "irasf001837111 is a clear outlier in a mid - infrared diagnostic diagram which combines the equivalent width of the 6.2@xmath0 m pah emission feature and the silicate strength in the so - called ` fork ' diagram @xcite . in this diagram",
    "most ulirgs are found along one of two branches .",
    "one branch connects starburst - dominated mid - infrared spectra ( e.g. ngc7714 and m82 ) to spectra of deeply buried central sources , characterized by very deep silicate features and the ( virtual ) absence of pah emission ( e.g. iras08572 + 3915 ) .",
    "the other branch connects starburst - dominated sources with featureless hot dust - dominated sources , which are mostly agn dominated .",
    "irasf001837111 is located in the scarcely populated region in between the tips of the two branches and has iras12127 + 1412ne as its nearest neighbor .",
    "their location , away from other deeply obscured sources , either implies a more than 10 times lower 6.2@xmath0 m pah equivalent width than other ulirgs with similar silicate strength , or a less pronounced silicate feature than other deeply obscured ulirgs .",
    "@xcite have proposed that sources in between the two branches may be agn evolving from a fully covered obscuring geometry to an incomplete or clumpy obscuring geometry , with a decrease in apparent depth of the silicate feature as a result . in this scenario , the detection of strongly blue shifted neon line emission",
    "would then trace a unique phase in the ( partial ) disruption of the obscuring medium around the powerful agn .",
    "alternatively , the isolated positions of irasf001837111 and iras12127 + 1412ne in the fork diagram may be the result of unusual lines of sight into these systems .",
    "the unusual mid - infrared excitation conditions and kinematics may then be associated to that .",
    "if sources with mid - infrared kinematic properties and neon / pah ratios similar to irasf001837111 and iras12127 + 1412ne are indeed agn evolving from full to incomplete or clumpy obscuration , there should be observational characteristics linking them .",
    "however , the only ulirg in our sample with these same mid - infrared properties , iras13451 + 1232 , has a mid - infrared continuum spectrum which is very different from the other two sources , displaying only a weak silicate absorption feature on an otherwise featureless power law spectrum .",
    "this places it firmly on the agn branch in the fork diagram , far off from the other two sources .",
    "evidence supporting an unusual evolutionary stage is presented by @xcite .",
    "based on the shape of its radio sed and a kinematic study of its optical emission line spectrum , they conclude that iras13451 + 1232 must be a young compact radio source whose radio jets are expanding through a dense nuclear dust shell , entraining gas and dust from this shell .",
    "they infer the reddening to be highest toward the broadest ( most disturbed ) most blue shifted kinematic component in their optical line study , reminiscent of our findings for irasf001837111 using optical , near and mid - infrared line profiles .",
    "we have discovered high - velocity ionized gas with velocities ranging from -3500 to + 3000 km s@xmath1 as part of a nuclear outflow from the ulirg irasf001837111 .",
    "the gas is traced by the mid - infrared 12.81@xmath0 m [ ne ii ] and 15.51@xmath0 m [ ne iii ] lines , which are dominated by blue shifted components .",
    "optical and near - infrared spectroscopic studies show no evidence for similar high - velocity gas components in forbidden lines at shorter wavelengths . we interpret this as the result of strong extinction ( a@xmath2=1050 ; a@xmath49@xmath171 ) on the blue shifted gas , identifying the base of the optical outflow ( @xmath173@xmath22 east ) as its most likely origin .",
    "unusual excitation conditions in irasf001837111 are further implied by a comparison of the combined [ ne ii ] and [ ne iii ] luminosity and the combined 6.2 and 11.2@xmath0 m pah luminosity for a large sample of agns , ulirgs and starburst galaxies .",
    "this reveals the neon line emission in irasf001837111 to be at least 8 times stronger compared to its pah emission than the typical ratio for the sample .",
    "two other ulirgs in our sample of 56 display mid - infrared excitation and kinematic properties similar to irasf001837111 : iras121271412ne and iras13451 + 1232 .",
    "both sources have elevated neon / pah ratios and exhibit pronounced blue wings in their 15.56@xmath0 m [ ne iii ] line profiles .",
    "wings are also present in their 12.81@xmath0 m [ ne ii ] profiles , but are less pronounced , indicating blue shifted gas to have a higher [ ne iii]/[ne ii ] ratio than gas closer to systemic velocity .",
    "iras13451 + 1232 even shows strongly blue shifted 14.32@xmath0 m [ ne v ] emission .    while for iras13451 + 1232 the observed [ ne iii]/[ne ii ] and [ ne v]/[ne ii ] ratios indicate exposure of the blue shifted gas to direct radiation from the agn , for irasf001837111 and iras121271412ne the observed ratios are consistent with an origin in fast shocks ( v@xmath25500 km s@xmath1 ) in an environment with gas densities n@xmath2510@xmath43 .",
    "irasf001837111 and iras121271412ne are clear outliers in the mid - infrared diagnostic diagram of silicate strength and 6.2@xmath0 m pah equivalent width , the so - called ` fork ' diagram @xcite .",
    "the sources are found in between the two branches which separate deeply buried nuclei and sources with incomplete or clumpy obscuring geometries . @xcite",
    "have proposed that ulirgs in between the tips of these branches may be agn in the process of disrupting their fully covered geometry before settling on the agn branch .",
    "iras13451 + 1232 would then already be there , given its nearly featureless mid - infrared power law spectrum .",
    "the results from our mid - infrared kinematic and excitation study are consistent with the above evolutionary scenario in that the strongly blue shifted [ ne ii ] and [ ne iii ] emission ( from shocks ) may trace the ( partial ) disruption of the obscuring medium around buried agns in irasf001837111 and iras121271412ne .",
    "the detection of strongly blue shifted [ ne v ] emission in iras13451 + 1232 may then indicate the lifting of the obscuration around the agn coronal line region to be further advanced in this ulirg than in irasf001837111 and iras121271412ne , where this line is undetected .",
    "our measurements of the s(1 ) , s(2 ) , s(3 ) and s(4 ) pure rotational molecular hydrogen lines allow us to investigate the properties of warm molecular hydrogen in irasf001837111 .",
    "unfortunately , a measurement of the important s(0 ) line is lacking as it is outside the irs - lh bandpass . in fig.[fig6 ] we show the excitation diagram for molecular hydrogen for the four measured lines .",
    "given the placement of the s(3 ) line at the peak of the silicate absorption feature , we can attempt an extinction correction on the four data points under the assumption that a ) the excitation temperature should be constant or increase monotonically with increasing upper level energy e@xmath53(@xmath54,j ) , b ) that the ortho - to - para ratio is 3 ( i.e. assuming lte ) , and c ) that the cooler gas probed by the s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines is more or less co - spatial with the warmer gas probed by the s(3 ) and s(4 ) lines . adopting the local ism extinction law of @xcite , we then find that the extinction on the h@xmath18 lines ranges between a@xmath2=15 and 25 .",
    "this is far lower than the extinction on the continuum source , which is a@xmath2@xmath2554 based on the apparent depth of the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature ( @xmath55=3.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a@xmath2/@xmath55=18 @xcite .      based on the two detected ortho - h@xmath18 lines , it is possible to infer an excitation temperature for the warm molecular hydrogen .",
    "the value ranges from 330 to 390k for extinction corrections ranging from a@xmath2=0 to 25 . assuming all h@xmath18 levels to be in lte at 330390k",
    ", we derive a total warm molecular hydrogen mass of 820@xmath910@xmath57 m@xmath7 .",
    "this value becomes a lower limit if the excitation temperature based on the upper level populations of the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines is lower than those based on the s(1 ) and s(3 ) lines  which is usually the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , we can not determine the warm to total molecular hydrogen fraction and compare this to other ulirgs , as no millimeter co line measurement exists for irasf001837111 from which to infer the cold molecular hydrogen mass .",
