    "in the hierarchical structure formation scenario based on a cdm universe , a galaxy forms by the assembly of many proto - galactic fragments .",
    "these small systems collapse first in the high density peaks in the initial density fluctuation fields , and grow by successive mergers between galaxies .",
    "this overall picture is supported by various pieces of observational evidence , such as the existence of dynamically decoupled subgalactic components within a galaxy ( eg . , de zeeuw et al .",
    "2002 ) or on - going mergers with tidal remains .",

    "they find a rapid increase in the fraction of close pairs with redshift , suggesting that a typical @xmath15 galaxy today has undergone 1 - 2 significant merger events since @xmath1 .",
    "dickinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that the most luminous lyman break galaxies at @xmath16 in the _ hubble deep field north _ are an order of magnitude less massive than @xmath17 today .",
    "clusters of galaxies are specially selected areas that grow from high density regions in the large scale structure of the early universe . in these regions ,",
    "the galaxy formation process is likely to be accerelated .",
    "this qualitatively explains why the majority of star formation in galaxies in cluster cores take place much earlier ( @xmath13 ) than that in the general field ( as shown by the extensive analyses based on the fundamental planes ( fp ) and the colour - magnitude relations ( cmr ) both locally and at higher redshifts eg .",
    ", bower et al . 1992 ; 1998 ; ellis et al . 1997 ; van dokkum et al . 1998 ; stanford et al . 1998 ; kodama et al . 1998 , kelson et al.2000 ) . compared to star formation , hierarchical galaxy formation models ( eg . , kauffmann 1996 ) predict that the mass assembly process is more widely spread over time . indeed , van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find many mergers or close companions in a @xmath18 cluster , suggesting that mass assembly is still in an active phase in this high redshift cluster , even though the star formation in most of these mergers have been completed ( as suggested from their red colours ) .",
    "the key issue now is to identify the epoch by which the cluster galaxies have accumulated most of their mass .",
    "this is still an open question .",
    "however , measuring total galaxy masses at high redshifts is difficult , since dynamical measurements of internal velocity dispersion for a large statistical sample becomes extremely time consuming even with 8 - 10  m telescopes ( van dokkum & stanford 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , stellar mass can be more easily estimated based on the near - infrared luminosity .",
    "the near - infrared luminosity of a galaxy is relatively insensitive to its on - going / recent star formation history even at high redshifts ( @xmath1 ) , and hence gives a good measure of the underlying total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) showed that the evolution of near - infrared luminosity function ( lf ) was a sensitive test of galaxy formation models , where we should expect to see strong evolution with redshift if the mass of the galaxies are growing due to the assembly processes .",
    "kauffmann & charlot argued that this evolution will be most prominent in the number density of massive galaxies , since it takes longer to form these massive systems .",
    "for the brightest cluster galaxies , aragn - salamanca , baugh , & kauffmann ( 1998 ) have shown that there is significant mass evolution between @xmath12 and present - day , typically by a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "the observational result that the central galaxy of a @xmath19 cluster is separated to multiple systems supports this view ( yamada et al .",
    "2002 ) . this can be easily understood , since the brightst cluster galaxy preferentially sits in the dynamical centre of a cluster , where the satellite galaxies tend to sink and merge towards the central galaxy due to the dynamical friction ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .    pioneering work using the @xmath20-band lf to quantify the mass evolution of the cluster galaxy population has been presented by barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1998 ) and de propris ( 1999 ) for many distant clusters out to @xmath21 .",
    "they both find that the change of characteristic luminosities of the @xmath20-band lfs with redshift is entirely consistent with the passive evolution of galaxies formed at high redshifts ( @xmath22 ) , suggesting mass evolution is negligable between @xmath21 and the present .",
    "these results have pushed the mass assembly epoch of the massive cluster galaxies to higher redshift ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that their analyses are limited to the very central part of the clusters ( typically clustercentric distance of @xmath24@xmath60.5  mpc ) , and may not be representative of the whole cluster population due to dynamical mass segregation .    in this paper , we present the combined @xmath0-band luminosity function of the two @xmath1 clusters drawn from a wide field ( @xmath24@xmath61  mpc ) in order to study the stellar mass evolution of the representative cluster population as a whole .",
    "we use @xmath25 colours to correct for the effect of star formation on the mass - to - luminosity ( @xmath26 ) ratio in order to derive the stellar mass .",
    "the crucial issue is whether there is a deficit of massive galaxies ( @xmath27 ) at @xmath1 compared to the less massive galaxies .",
    "a detection of this deficit would confirm the importance of galaxy mergers , as suggested by hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "an outline of the paper follows . after describing the cluster selection , observation and the data reduction in   2 , and the data processing including the corrections for incompleteness and foreground and background contamination in   3 , we present the @xmath0-band number counts , luminosity function , and the stellar mass function of the @xmath1 clusters in   4 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in   5 and ",
    "6 , respectively .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted throughout this paper are ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30)=(0.7 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) , unless otherwise stated . here we define @xmath28 and @xmath31 as @xmath32/(100  km s@xmath33 mpc@xmath33 ) and @xmath32/(70  km s@xmath33mpc@xmath33 ) , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : ratio ]    to quanify the comparison between the models and data in a way that is independent of the normalisation , we define the giant - to - dwarf ratio , @xmath34(giant / dwarf ) , as @xmath35 the ratios are calculated from data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mf ] , and are summarised in table  2 .",
    "this shows that the fraction of giant galaxies at @xmath12 in the semi - analytic predictions is factor @xmath363 smaller than the observed value .",
    "the scatter of the ratio in the tokyo model measured from the 100 generated clusters ( 0.05 ) is too small to account for the over - abundance of the massive galaxies in the real high redshift clusters .",
    "how much mass evolution can be allowed between @xmath12 and the present - day within the errors of our analysis ? to answer this question , we shift the local mass function of 2mass / lcrs clusters ( balogh et al .",
    "2001 ) towards lower masses and calculate the statistical deviation from the observed mass function at @xmath1 by a boot - strap resampling method ( ie . , randomly replacing the observed points assuming the gaussian errors on each point ) . from this analysis",
    ", we find that we can reject a mass decrease of a factor of 2 at 99% level ( 2.5@xmath2 ) no matter whether the bright blue galaxies are included or excluded . since the definition of bright blue cut that we introduced in  4.2 is somewhat arbitrary , we consider the effect of further reducing the numbers of galaxies in the brightest bin , moving it two sigma down from its original place . even in this extreme case , the giant - to - dwarf ratio is 0.27 and is still 2.3 @xmath2 off from the factor 2 evolution in mass , corresponding to 98% rejection level .",
    "in contrast to the bright cluster galaxies , faint galaxies seem to have a much greater diversity of formation histories . the faint galaxies may be in general formed at later cosmic times than the massive galaxies , although this appears to be opposite to the hierarchical picture .",
    "if so , then distant clusters should have a lf that has a declining faint - end slope in contrast to the rising faint - end slope of local clusters ( balogh et al .",
    "2001 ; de propris et al . 1998 ) . the progression of formation activity to lower - mass galaxies as the universe ages is often referred to as the `` down - sizing '' effect ( cowie et al .  1996 ; kodama & bower 2001 ) .",
    "kajisawa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested just such a deficit of faint galaxies ( @xmath37 , or @xmath38 + 1.5 ) in the 3c324 cluster at @xmath39 .    in our two @xmath1 clusters",
    ", however , such a strong deficit is not confirmed down to @xmath40 ( @xmath4 + 2.7 ) ( fig .  [",
    "fig : klf ] ) . a marginal discrepancy ( @xmath32@xmath2 ) between @xmath41 and",
    "1 is seen in the least massive bin of the stellar mass functions ( the solid lines and our data points in figs .",
    "[ fig : mf ] ) . however , given the fact that the faint - end slope of the local mass function of cluster galaxies ( 2mass / lcrs ; balogh et al .",
    "2001 ) is only poorly determined ( @xmath42 ( 1@xmath2 ) ) , we can not discuss further whether there is an evolution between @xmath41 and 1 in the faint end of the mass function from the current data set . to test the hypothesis of different formation epoch depending on galaxy mass , our data would need to go deeper than @xmath43 .",
    "however , we certainly see significant numbers of less massive galaxies below 1.5@xmath710@xmath44m@xmath9 , which are nearly absent in kajisawa et al .",
    "we speculate that the reason why they saw such a deficit of less massive galaxies is their limited field coverage ( cluster - centric distance @xmath24@xmath4540@xmath46 or 0.33  mpc ) .",
    "one might be concerned that our high giant - to - dwarf ratio at @xmath12 clusters and hence the relatively strong constraint on the mass growth rate , is partly driven by the deficiency of the less massive galaxies at @xmath12 as well as the abundance of massive galaxies .",
    "we verify this effect on our conclusions by artificially increasing the numbers of galaxies in the least massive bin at @xmath12 by 2@xmath2 , and by flattening the faint end slope of the @xmath41 curve ( 2mass / lcrs ) by @xmath47 .",
    "however , these effects on the constraint on the mass growth factor is found to be small .",
    "for example , in the first case , the giant - to - dwarf ratio goes down to @xmath34=0.26 and 0.24 with and without the bright blue galaxies , respectively , but the mass evolution of factor 2 between @xmath12 and 0 ( which gives @xmath34=0.07 ) is still rejected at 98% level ( 2.3@xmath2 ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the stellar populations of galaxies in clusters are old with little on - going star formation based on the colours and the fundamental planes studies ( eg .",
    ", bower et al . , 1992 ; 1998 ; ellis et al . 1997 ; van dokkum et al . 1998 ; stanford et al .",
    "1998 ; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ; kelson et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , the stellar populations of galaxies may be old , but at the same time the galaxies may not have been completely assembled . between @xmath12 and the present - day , galaxies might grow in mass through collisions .",
    "this key issue can only be tested by comparing the luminosity functions of galaxies in clusters at different redshifts .",
    "early assembly of massive galaxies is a challenge for hierarchical models of galaxy formation since these models tend to grow galaxies through both on - going merging and gas accretion up to the present - day .",
    "the first generation of such models predicted very rapid galaxy growth ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "more recent models within a @xmath48-cdm universe and revised merging prescriptions ( eg . , cole et al . , 2000",
    ") have predicted evolution that is slower but still significant  see cimatti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a recent discussion and comparision with field data .    in clusters of galaxies",
    ", we might anticipate that the rate of evolution of galaxy mass is less than in the field since rich clusters are over dense regions of the universe in which gravitational collapse has been accelerated .",
    "thus an important issue that has concerned us is that clusters which are observed at @xmath1 are not directly equivalent to the progenitors of clusters in the local universe ( ie . , while the galaxies in the distant clusters form part of the local cluster population , there are many galaxies in local clusters which were located in lower density environments at @xmath12 ) .",
    "care is therefore need to select galaxies from the semi - analytic models , and we have tried to select clusters in the same way in both the semi - analytic models and the data .",
    "we applied two different ways of selecting the systems in the models  by mass and by space density  but both definitions give similar results and predict a significant reduction in the characteristic stellar mass of cluster galaxies with redshift .",
    "in contrast to the model , however , our observations of two distant clusters show that the evolution of the luminosity function is well modelled by passive evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "the @xmath20-band luminosity function is slightly brighter at @xmath12 than at @xmath41 .",
    "however , when we correct the observed galaxy luminosities for the passive evolution of the stellar population , and cosmological dimming , we find that the galaxy mass function has evolved little over this time .",
    "a factor of 2 evolution is only marginally consistent with the data ( @xmath32.5@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , this level of uncertainty means that our data can not yet completely rule out the heirarchical model . if we could fix the mass function normalisation using the total ( ie .",
    ", dark plus stellar mass ) of the clusters the evolution in galaxy mass predicted by the theoretical models would be much clearer . unfortunately the clusters we have studied have no reliable mass estimates that we can use to independently secure the lf normalisation ( the only measure available is a velocity dispersion of 397 km s@xmath33 for the 3c336 cluster , measured from eight cluster members : steidel et al .",
    "this is an important area for future work .",
    "there is no significant difference in the stellar mass function between the 3c336 and q1335 clusters ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the cluster to cluster scatter in the theoretical models is also small ( @xmath50 @xmath34(giant / dwarf)=0.05 ) . in an individual cluster ,",
    "the measured luminosity function is dependent on the background subtraction .",
    "however , even if we artificially change the background level by a factor 2 , the resulting change in the giant / dwarf ratio is found to be less than 0.1 .",
    "it therefore seems that our conclusion is not significantly affected by the field - to - field variation of the background .    finally , there are uncertainties in the theoretical model predictions . for this reason it has been useful to check that we obtain similar results for both the durham and mitaka models . in addition ,",
    "the simulations allow us to check that cluster to cluster variation is not significant .",
    "a concern when comparing theoretical and observational results is the radius over which the comparison is made .",
    "the wide field of our observations ( @xmath24@xmath61  mpc ) means that they include a large fraction of the cluster virial radius , and are thus directly comparable to the observational results .",
    "it is interesting to note that the discrepancy between our results and the deficit of faint ( @xmath51 + 1.5 ) galaxies by kajisawa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , might result from this type of mass segregation .",
    "we have presented the near - infrared lf of galaxies in the two high confidence @xmath1 cluster candidates based on deep wide - field imaging .",
    "a third cluster was observed , but has then been excluded because of contamination by a foreground system .",
    "we find that the @xmath0-band lf at @xmath1 is consistent with pure luminosity evolution with constant stellar mass according to the passive evolution with old age ( @xmath52 ) , if compared to the lower redshift counterparts , such as 2mass / lcrs lf for local clusters .",
    "we have transformed our lf at @xmath1 to a stellar mass function by correcting for the star formation contribution to the @xmath0-band light as estimated from the @xmath25 colours .",
    "the derived stellar mass function is found to be very similar to the one for the 2mass / lcrs local clusters . in particular ,",
    "massive galaxies ( @xmath53@xmath54m@xmath9 ) make up a significant fraction of the galaxy population .",
    "this result presents a challenge for current hierarchical galaxy formation models which tend to under - predict the fraction of massive galaxies compared to our observed data .",
    "the next steps are threefold .",
    "one is to increase the sample of clusters at similar redshift ( @xmath1 ) and to have better statistics on the derived stellar mass function at this epoch .",
    "the second is to extend this analysis to higher redshift ( @xmath13 ) to identify the epoch at which the massive galaxies are assembled .",
    "the third is to extend this analysis along an environmental axis .",
    "galaxy - galaxy mergers are likely to be most effective in the group environment rather than the cluster cores where velocity dispersion is too high ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , it may be the case that the mass growth can be clearly seen at lower redshifts in these lower density regions .",
