    "the physics of mott insulators in two and higher dimensions has enjoyed much attention since the discovery of cuprate superconductors . while a quantitative synthesis of theory and experiment in the superconducting materials remains elusive ,",
    "much progress has been made in describing a number of antiferromagnetic mott insulators .",
    "a number of such insulators have been studied extensively in the past decade , with a few prominent examples being cav@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , ( c@xmath3h@xmath4n@xmath5)@xmath5cu@xmath5cl@xmath1 @xcite , srcu@xmath5(bo@xmath6)@xmath5 @xcite , tlcucl@xmath6 @xcite , and cs@xmath5cucl@xmath1 @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "it has even been possible to tune these insulators across quantum phase transitions by applied pressure @xcite or by an applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a useful survey of some of these experiments may be found in the recent article by matsumoto _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "it would clearly be valuable to understand the structure of the global phase diagram of antiferromagnetic mott insulators above one dimension .",
    "the compounds mentioned above would then correspond to distinct points in this phase diagram , and placing them in this manner should help us better understand the relationship between different materials .",
    "one could also classify the quantum critical points accessed by the pressure or field - tuning experiments .",
    "the purpose of this article is to review recent theoretical work towards achieving this goal .",
    "we will focus mainly on the case of two spatial dimensions ( @xmath7 ) , but our methods and results often have simple generalizations to @xmath8 .",
    "one useful vantage point for opening this discussion is the family of mott insulators with a gap to all spin excitations .",
    "all spin gap compounds discovered to date have the important property of being `` dimerized '' , or more precisely , they have an even number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell @xcite . in such cases",
    ", the spin gap can be understood by adiabatic continuation from the simple limiting case in which the spins form local spin singlets within each unit cell .",
    "a simple approach that can be used for a theoretical description of such insulators is the method of bond operators @xcite .",
    "this method has been widely applied , and in some cases provides an accurate quantitative description of numerical studies and experiments @xcite .",
    "we will describe it here in section  [ sec : dimer ] in the very simple context of a coupled dimer antiferromagnet ; similar results are obtained in more complicated , and realistic , lattice structures .",
    "section  [ sec : dimer ] will also describe the quantum phase transition(s ) accessed by varying coupling constants in the hamiltonian while maintaining spin rotation invariance ( this corresponds to experiments in applied pressure ) : the spin gap closes at a quantum critical point beyond which there is magnetic order .",
    "section  [ sec : qc ] will discuss some of the important experimental consequences of this quantum criticality at finite temperatures .",
    "a distinct quantum critical point , belonging to a different universality class , is obtained when the spin gap is closed by an applied magnetic field  this is described in section  [ sec : mag ] .",
    "the remaining sections discuss the theoretically much more interesting and subtle cases of materials with an odd number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell , such as la@xmath5cuo@xmath1 and cs@xmath5cucl@xmath1 .",
    "a complementary , but compatible , perspective on the physics of such antiferromagnets may be found in the review article by misguich and lhuillier @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnets in this class can develop a spin gap by _ spontaneously _ breaking the lattice symmetry so that the lattice is effectively dimerized ( see discussion in the following paragraph ) .",
    "there are no known materials with a spin gap in which the lattice symmetry has not been broken , but there is a theoretical consensus that spin gap states without lattice symmetry breaking are indeed possible in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the study of antiferromagnets with an odd number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell is also important for the physics of the doped cuprates .",
    "these materials exhibit spin - gap - like behavior at low dopings , and many theories associate aspects of its physics with the spin gap state proximate to the magnetically ordered state of the square lattice antiferromagnet found in la@xmath5cuo@xmath1 .",
    "section  [ sec : square ] will describe the nature of a spin gap state on the square lattice .",
    "we begin with the nearest - neighbor @xmath0 heisenberg hamiltonian on the square lattice ",
    "this is known to have a magnetic nel order which breaks spin rotation invariance .",
    "now add further neighbor exchange couplings until magnetic order is lost and a spin gap appears .",
    "we will show that the ground state undergoes a novel , second - order quantum phase transition to a state with _ bond order _ : translational symmetry is spontaneously broken @xcite so that the resulting lattice structure has an even number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell .",
    "so aspects of the non - zero spin excitations in this paramagnet are very similar to the `` dimerized '' systems considered in section  [ sec : dimer ] , and experimentally they will appear to be almost identical . indeed , it may well be that the experimental materials initially placed in the class of section  [ sec : dimer ] , are secretely systems in the class of section  [ sec : square ] which have developed bond order driven by the physics of antiferromagets ( as in section  [ sec : para ] ) at some intermediate energy scale .",
    "the host lattice then distorts sympathetically to the bond order , and is effectively dimerized .",
    "such materials will possess many more low - lying singlet excitations than those in the theory of section  [ sec : dimer ] : these excitations play an important role in the restoration of translational symmetry as we move towards the nel state .",
    "unfortunately , such singlet excitations are rather difficult to detect experimentally",
    ".    section  [ sec : triangle ] will address the same issue as section  [ sec : square ] , but for the case of the triangular lattice . here",
    "the spins are ordered in a non - collinear configuration in the magnetically ordered state , as is observed at low temperatures in cs@xmath5cucl@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we will argue that in this case there is a route to destruction of magnetic order in which the resulting spin gap state preserves full lattice symmetry @xcite . such a spin gap state has a novel ` topological ' order @xcite which endows its excitations with charges under an emergent gauge force .",
    "recent experimental measurements of the dynamic structure factor of cs@xmath5cucl@xmath1 appear to be described rather well by the excitations of this topologically ordered state at energies above which the magnetic order of the ground state emerges @xcite .",
    "we begin by describing the quantum phase transition in a simple two - dimensional model of antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath0 heisenberg spins which has 2 spins per unit cell .",
    "the transition is tuned by varying a dimensionless parameter @xmath10 . as we noted in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] different ` dimerized ' mott insulators will correspond to different values of @xmath10 , and the value of @xmath10 can be tuned by applying pressure @xcite .",

    "we will restrict our attention to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that exactly at @xmath19 , @xmath15 is identical to the square lattice antiferromagnet , and this is the only point at which the hamiltonian has only one spin per unit cell . at all other values of @xmath10 @xmath15 has a pair of @xmath0 spins in each unit cell of the lattice .",
    "as will become clear from our discussion , this is a key characteristic which permits a simple theory for the quantum phase transition exhibited by @xmath15 .",
    "models with only a single @xmath0 spin per unit cell usually display far more complicated behavior , and will be discussed in sections  [ sec : square],[sec : triangle ] .",
    "we will begin with a physical discussion of the phases and excitations of the coupled dimer antiferromagnet , @xmath20 in section  [ sec : lad1 ] .",
    "we will propose a quantum field - theoretical description of this model in section  [ sec : lad2 ] : we will verify that the limiting regimes of the field theory contain excitations whose quantum numbers are in accord with the phases discussed in section  [ sec : lad1 ] , and will then use the field theory to describe the quantum critical behavior both at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath10 is close to 1 .",
    "exactly at @xmath21 , @xmath15 is identical to the square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet , and this is known to have long - range , magnetic nel order in its ground state _",
    "i.e. _ the spin - rotation symmetry is broken and the spins have a non - zero , staggered , expectation value in the ground state with @xmath22 where @xmath23 is some fixed unit vector in spin space , @xmath24 is @xmath25 on the two sublattices , and @xmath26 is the nel order parameter .",
    "this long - range order is expected to be preserved for a finite range of @xmath10 close to 1 .",
    "the low - lying excitations above the ground state consist of slow spatial deformations in the orientation @xmath23 : these are the familiar spin waves , and they can carry arbitrarily low energy _ i.e. _ the phase is ` gapless ' . the spectrum of the spin waves can be obtained from a text - book analysis of small fluctuations about the ordered nel state using the holstein - primakoff method @xcite : such an analysis yields _ two _ polarizations of spin waves at each wavevector @xmath27 ( measured from the antiferromagnetic ordering wavevector ) , and they have excitation energy @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the spin - wave velocities in the two spatial directions .",
    "let us turn now to the vicinity of @xmath30 .",
    "exactly at @xmath31 , @xmath15 is the hamiltonian of a set of decoupled dimers , with the simple exact ground state wavefunction shown in fig  [ fig2 ] : the spins in each dimer pair into valence bond singlets , leading to a paramagnetic state which preserves spin rotation invariance and all lattice symmetries .    .",

    "( b ) fission of the @xmath32 excitation into two @xmath0 spinons .",
    "the spinons are connected by a `` string '' of valence bonds ( denoted by dashed ovals ) which lie on weaker bonds ; this string costs a finite energy per unit length and leads to the confinement of spinons.,width=432 ]    note that this quasiparticle is _ not _ a spin - wave ( or equivalently , a ` magnon ' ) but is more properly referred to as a spin 1 _ exciton _ or a _ triplon _ @xcite .",
    "we parameterize its energy at small wavevectors @xmath33 ( measured from the minimum of the spectrum in the brillouin zone ) by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the spin gap , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are velocities ; we will provide an explicit derivation of ( [ epart ] ) in section  [ sec : lad2 ] .",
    "fig  [ fig3 ] also presents a simple argument which shows that the @xmath32 exciton can not fission into two @xmath0 ` spinons ' .",
    "the very distinct symmetry signatures of the ground states and excitations between @xmath38 and @xmath39 make it clear that the two limits can not be continuously connected .",

    "there are a number of ways to obtain the same final theory : here we will use the method of _ bond operators _",
    "@xcite , which has the advantage of making the connection to the lattice degrees of freedom most direct .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian using bosonic operators which reside on the centers of the @xmath13 links so that it is explicitly diagonal at @xmath31 .",
    "there are 4 states on each @xmath13 link ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) and we associate these with the canonical singlet boson @xmath47 and the canonical triplet bosons @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) so that @xmath50 here @xmath51 is some reference vacuum state which does not correspond to a physical state of the spin system .",
    "the physical states always have a single bond boson and so satisfy the constraint @xmath52 by considering the various matrix elements @xmath53 , @xmath54 , of the spin operators @xmath55 on the ends of the link , it follows that the action of @xmath56 and @xmath57 on the singlet and triplet states is equivalent to the operator identities @xmath58 where @xmath59,@xmath60,@xmath61 take the values @xmath62,@xmath63,@xmath64 , repeated indices are summed over and @xmath65 is the totally antisymmetric tensor . inserting ( [ rep2 ] ) into ( [ ham ] ) , and using ( [ const ] ) , we find the following hamiltonian for the bond bosons : @xmath66 \\label{bondham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 label links in @xmath13 , and @xmath68 are numbers associated with the lattice couplings which we will not write out explicitly .",
    "note that @xmath69 at @xmath31 , and so the spectrum of the paramagnetic state is fully and exactly determined .",
    "the main advantage of the present approach is that application of the standard methods of many body theory to ( [ bondham ] ) , while imposing the constraint ( [ const ] ) , gives a very satisfactory description of the phases with @xmath70 , including across the transition to the nel state .",
    "in particular , an important feature of the bond operator approach is that the simplest mean field theory already yields ground states and excitations with the correct quantum numbers ; so a strong fluctuation analysis is not needed to capture the proper physics .",
    "a complete numerical analysis of the properties of ( [ bondham ] ) in a self - consistent hartree - fock treatment of the four boson terms in @xmath71 has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all phases",
    "the @xmath47 boson is well condensed at zero momentum , and the important physics can be easily understood by examining the structure of the low energy action for the @xmath48 bosons . for the particular hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    ", the spectrum of the @xmath48 bosons has a minimum at the momentum @xmath72 , and for large enough @xmath10 the @xmath48 condense at this wavevector : the representation ( [ rep2 ] ) shows that this condensed state is the expected nel state , with the magnetic moment oscillating as in ( [ neel ] ) .",

    "it is useful to decompose the complex field @xmath48 into its real and imaginary parts as follows @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a normalization chosen below .",
    "insertion of ( [ tphi ] ) into ( [ st ] ) shows that the field @xmath85 has a quadratic term @xmath86 , and so the co - efficient of @xmath87 remains large even as the spin gap @xmath35 becomes small .",

    "it is clear that the effective potential of @xmath88 has a minimum at a non - zero @xmath88 , and that @xmath93 , the nel order parameter in ( [ neel ] ) .",
    "it is simple to carry out a small fluctuation analysis about this saddle point , and we obtain the doublet of gapless spin - wave modes advertised earlier .",
    "we close this subsection by noting that all of the above results have a direct generalization to other lattices , and also to spin systems in three dimensions .",
    "@xcite have applied the bond operator method to tlcucl@xmath6 and obtained good agreement with experimental observations .",
    "one important difference that emerges in such calculations on some frustrated lattices @xcite is worth noting explicitly here : the minimum of the @xmath48 spectrum need not be at special wavevector like @xmath72 , but can be at a more generic wavevector @xmath94 such that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are not separated by a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "a simple example which we consider here is an extension of ( [ ham ] ) in which there are additional exchange interactions along all diagonal bonds oriented ` north - east ' ( so that the lattice has the connectivity of a triangular lattice ) .",
    "in such cases , the structure of the low energy action is different , as is the nature of the magnetically ordered state .",
    "the parameterization ( [ t1 ] ) must be replaced by @xmath96 where @xmath97 are independent complex fields .",
    "proceeding as above , we find that the low energy effective action ( [ sp ] ) is replaced by @xmath98 .",

    "if @xmath102 , configurations with @xmath103 are preferred : in such configurations @xmath104 , where @xmath105 are two equal - length orthogonal vectors .",
    "then from ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ rep2 ] ) it is easy to see that the physical spins possess _ spiral _ order in the magnetically ordered state in which @xmath99 is condensed .",
    "a spiral state is illustrated in fig  [ fig13 ] , and we will have more to say about this state in section  [ sec : triangle ] . for the case",
    "@xmath106 , the optimum configuration has @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a real vector : this leads to a magnetically ordered state with spins polarized _",
    "collinearly _ in a spin density wave at the wavevector @xmath94 .",
    "we will restrict our discussion here to the critical point described by @xmath91 .",
    "similar results apply to @xmath109 for the parameter regime in which it exhibits a second order transition @xcite . experimentally , the results below are relevant to materials that can be tuned across the magnetic ordering transition by applied pressure ( such as tlcucl@xmath6 @xcite ) , or to materials which happen to be near a critical point at ambient pressure ( such as lacuo@xmath110 @xcite ) .",
    "the field theory @xmath91 is actually a familiar and well - studied model in the context of classical critical phenomena . upon interpreting @xmath74 as a third spatial co - ordinate",
    ", @xmath91 becomes the theory of a classical o(3)-invariant heisenberg ferromagnet at finite temperatures ( in general a @xmath7 dimensional quantum antiferromagnet will map to a @xmath111 dimensional classical heisenberg ferromagnet at finite temperature @xcite ) .",
    "the curie transition of the heisenberg ferromagnet then maps onto the quantum critical point between the paramagnetic and nel states described above .",
    "a number of important implications for the quantum problem can now be drawn immediately .",
    "the theory @xmath91 has a ` relativistic ' invariance , and consequently the dynamic critical exponent must be @xmath112 .",
    "the spin correlation length will diverge at the quantum critical point with the exponent @xcite @xmath113 .",
    "the spin gap of the paramagnet , @xmath35 , vanishes as @xmath114 , and this prediction is in excellent agreement with the numerical study of the dimerized antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "a somewhat more non - trivial consequence of this mapping is in the structure of the spectrum at the critical point @xmath115 . at the curie transition of the classical ferromagnet",
    "it is known @xcite that spin correlations decay as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the 3-component momentum in the 3-dimensional classical space .",
    "we can now analytically continue this expression from its @xmath118 dependence in the third classical dimension to the real frequency , @xmath119 , describing the quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "this yields the following fundamental result for the dynamic spin susceptibility , @xmath120 , at the @xmath121 quantum critical point of the coupled - dimer antiferromagnet : @xmath122 where @xmath65 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "note that in ( [ e4 ] ) the momentum @xmath33 is measured from the @xmath123 ordering wavevector of the nel state .",
    "the exponent @xmath124 is the same as that of the classical heisenberg ferromagnet , and has a rather small value @xcite : @xmath125 .",
    "however , the non - zero @xmath124 does make a significant difference to the physical interpretation of the excitations at the critical point .",
    "in particular note that @xmath126 does not have a pole at any @xmath33 , but rather a continuum spectral weight above a threshold energy @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the unit step function .",
    "this indicates there are no quasiparticles at the critical point , and only a dissipative critical continuum .",
    "there is also some very interesting structure in the quantum critical dynamic response at nonzero @xmath16 @xcite . here",
    ", one way to understand the physics is to approach the critical point from the paramagnetic side ( @xmath129 ) . as we noted earlier",
    ", the paramagnetic phase has well - defined ` triplon ' or ` spin exciton ' excitations @xmath48 , and these have an infinite lifetime at @xmath121 . at @xmath130",
    ", thermally excited @xmath48 quasiparticles will collide with each other via their scattering amplitude , @xmath131 , and this will lead to a finite lifetime @xcite .",
    "now approach @xmath132 .",
    "the renormalization group analysis of @xmath91 tells us that the quartic coupling @xmath131 approaches a fixed point value in the critical region .",
    "this means that @xmath131 is no longer an arbitrary parameter , and an appropriately defined @xmath48 scattering amplitude must also acquire universal behavior .",
    "in particular , the @xmath48 lifetime is determined by the only energy scale available , which is @xmath133 .",
    "so we have the remarkable result that the characteristic spin relaxation time is a universal number times @xmath134 .",
    "more precisely , we can write for the local dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath135 the universal scaling form @xmath136 here @xmath137 is a universal function which has the limiting behaviors @xmath138 note that @xmath137 has a smooth linear behavior in the regime @xmath139 , and this is similar to any simple dissipative system .",
    "the difference here is that the co - efficient of dissipation is determined by @xmath133 alone .",
    "the quantum critical behavior described here is expected to apply more generally to other correlated electron systems , provided the critical theory has non - linear couplings which approach fixed point values .",
    "an important perturbation that can be easily applied to antiferromagnets in the class discussed in section  [ sec : dimer ] is a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the zeeman energy in available fields can often be comparable to the typical antiferromagnetic exchange constant @xmath140 , and so the ground state can be perturbed significantly .",
    "it is therefore of interest to understand the evolution of the phase diagram in fig  [ fig4 ] under an applied field of arbitrary strength .",
    "we are interested here in the evolution of the ground state as a function of @xmath141 where the hamiltonian @xmath15 in ( [ ham ] ) is transformed as @xmath142 most of the basic features can actually be understood quite easily in a simple extension of the self - consistent hartree - fock theory of bond bosons that was discussed in section  [ sec : lad2 ] . under the transformation ( [ hamb ] )",
    ", it is easily seen from ( [ rep2 ] ) that @xmath143 the presence of a non - zero @xmath141 breaks spin rotation invariance and so all the self - consistent expectation values of operator bilinears have to reflect this reduced symmetry in the hartree - fock theory .",
    "apart from this the mechanics of the computation mostly remain the same . however , for stronger fields , it is sometimes necessary to allow for broken translational symmetry in the expectation values , as the ground state can acquire a modulated structure .",
    "we will discuss the results of such an analysis in weak and strong fields in the following subsections .      for weak fields applied to the paramagnet (",
    "specifically , for fields @xmath144 , the influence of ( [ hambt ] ) can be understood exactly .",
    "the coupling to @xmath141 involves an operator which commutes with the remaining hamiltonian ( the total spin ) , and hence the wavefunction of the ground state remains insensitive to the value of @xmath141 .",
    "the same applies to the wavefunctions of the excited states .",
    "however , the excited states can have non - zero total spin and so their energies do depend upon @xmath141 .",
    "in particular the triplet @xmath48 quasiparticle with energy ( [ epart ] ) or ( [ epart2 ] ) carries total spin @xmath32 , and consequently we conclude that this triplet splits according to @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "note that the lowest energy quasiparticle ( with @xmath147 ) has a positive energy as long as @xmath144 , and this is required for the stability of the paramagnet .",
    "so the phase boundary of the paramagnetic phase is exactly @xmath148 , and using @xmath149 , we can sketch the boundary of the paramagnetic phase as in fig  [ fig5 ] .     under a weak field @xmath141 ( magnetization plateau at large @xmath141 , appearing in fig  [ fig6 ] ,",
    "are not shown ) .",
    "the paramagnetic phase has exactly the same ground state wavefunction as that at @xmath150 .",

    "the corresponding phase diagram of the field - induced magnetic ordering transition of a superconductor ( rather than a mott insulator ) has been investigated recently @xcite , and successfully applied to experiments on the doped cuprates ; this phase diagram of the superconductor has significant differences from the one above.,width=432 ]    what happens beyond the paramagnetic phase ? as in section  [ sec : lad2 ] , we answer this question by using the transformation ( [ tphi ] ) , and by examining the analog of @xmath91 under a non - zero @xmath141 . using ( [ hambt ] ) , and integrating out @xmath85 , we now find that the action @xmath91 in ( [ sp ] ) remains unchanged apart from the mapping @xcite @xmath153 the action ( [ sp ] ) , ( [ spb ] ) can now be analyzed by a traditional small fluctuation analysis about @xmath154 .",

    "then the co - efficient of @xmath156 is @xmath47 , while that of @xmath157 is @xmath158 .",

    "the model @xmath15 is a member of the class @xmath206 only at @xmath21 ; at other values of @xmath10 the symmetry group of the square lattice is explicitly broken , and the doubling of the unit cell was crucial in the analysis of section  [ sec : dimer ] . with full square lattice symmetry , the paramagnetic phase is not determined as simply as in the small @xmath10 expansion , and we have to account more carefully for the ` resonance ' between different valence bond configurations",
    ".    one ground state of @xmath206 is , of course , the nel state characterized by ( [ neel ] ) ; this is obtained in the absence of the interactions denoted by ellipses in ( [ hams ] ) .",

    "we can divide the possibilities for this state into two broad classes , which we discuss in turn .    in the first class of paramagnets ,",
    "no symmetries of the hamiltonian are broken , and the spins have paired with each other into valence bond singlets which strongly resonate between the large number of possible pairings : this is a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) liquid @xcite .",
    "we will discuss such states further in section  [ sec : triangle ] : they have a connection with magnetically ordered states with non - collinear magnetic order , unlike the collinear nel state of the nearest neighbor square lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "in the second class of paramagnets , the valence bond singlets spontaneously crystallize into some configuration which necessarily breaks a lattice symmetry .",
    "a simple example of such a _ bond - ordered _ paramagnet is the columnar state we have already considered in fig  [ fig2 ] . for the dimerized antiferromagnet @xmath15 , the bond configuration in fig  [ fig2 ] was chosen explicitly in the hamiltonian by the manner in which we divided the links into classes @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath207 . for @xmath206",
    ", there is no such distinction between the links , and hence a state like fig  [ fig2 ] _ spontaneously _ breaks a lattice symmetry .",
    "furthermore , there are 3 other equivalent states , obtained by successive 90 degree rotations of fig  [ fig2 ] about any lattice site , which are completely equivalent .",
    "so for @xmath206 , the bond - ordered paramagnet in fig  [ fig2 ] is four - fold degenerate .",

    "we will develop an effective model for quantum fluctuations about the collinear nel state in @xmath206 below , and will find that such bond - ordered paramagnets emerge naturally @xcite .",
    "let us now try to set up a theory for quantum fluctuations about the nel state ( [ neel ] ) .",
    "it is best to do this in a formulation that preserves spin rotation invariance at all stages , and this is facilitated by the coherent state path integral ( see chapter 13 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the essential structure of this path integral can be understood simply by looking at a single spin in a magnetic field @xmath211 with the hamiltonian @xmath212 .",

    "so the above path integral is over all closed curves on the surface of a sphere .",
    "the first term in the action of the path integral is the crucial berry phase : @xmath218 $ ] is _ half _ the oriented area enclosed by the curve @xmath219 ( the reason for the half will become clear momentarily ) .",
    "note that this area is only defined modulo @xmath220 , the surface area of a unit sphere .",
    "the expression ( [ single ] ) has an obvious generalization to the lattice hamiltonian @xmath206 : the action adds up the berry phases of every spin , and there is an additional energy term which is just the hamiltonian with the replacement @xmath221 .",
    "we are now faced with the problem of keeping track of the areas enclosed by the curves traced out by all the spins .",
    "this seems rather daunting , particularly because the half - area @xmath222 $ ] is a global object defined by the whole curve , and can not be obviously be associated with local portions of the curve .",

    "the heights are integers on one square sublattice , and half - odd - integers on the second sublattice . finally for even integer",
    "@xmath214 the offset has no effect and the height is an integer on all sites .",
    "we discuss these classes of @xmath214 values in turn in the following subsections .      in this case",
    "the offsets @xmath336 are all integers , and ( [ he1 ] ) is just an ordinary three dimensional height model which has been much studied in the literature @xcite . unlike the two - dimensional case , three - dimensional height models generically have no roughening transition , and the interface is always smooth @xcite . with all heights integers ,",
    "the smooth phase breaks no lattice symmetries .",
    "so square lattice antiferromagnets with @xmath214 even integer can have a paramagnetic ground state with a spin gap and no broken symmetries .",
    "the smooth interface corresponds to confinement in the dual compact u(1 ) gauge theory @xcite : consequently the @xmath337 of @xmath269 are confined , and the elementary excitations are @xmath32 quasiparticles , similar to the @xmath338 of @xmath339 .",
    "this is in accord with the exact ground state for a @xmath340 antiferromagnet on the square lattice found by affleck _",
    "_ , the aklt state @xcite .",
    "now the heights of the interface model can take four possible values , which are integers plus the offsets on the four square sublattices shown in fig  [ fig9]a . as in section  [ s2].1 ,",
    "the interface is always smooth _",
    "i.e. _ any state of ( [ he1 ] ) has a fixed average interface height @xmath341 where the sum is over a large set of @xmath342 dual lattice points which respect the square lattice symmetry .",
    "_ any _ well - defined value for @xmath343 breaks the uniform shift symmetry of the height model under which @xmath344 . in the present context ,",
    "only the value of @xmath343 modulo integers is physically significant , and so the breaking of the shift symmetry is not important by itself .",
    "however , after accounting for the height offsets , we now prove that _ any smooth interface must also break a lattice symmetry with the development of bond order _ : this means that @xmath313 in ( [ f6 ] ) describes spin gap ground states of the lattice antiferromagnet which necessarily have spontaneous bond order .",
    "the proof of this central result becomes clear upon a careful study of the manner in which the height model in ( [ he1 ] ) and ( [ he2 ] ) implements the 90@xmath345 rotation symmetry about a direct square lattice point .",
    "consider such a rotation under which the dual sublattice points in fig  [ fig9]c interchange as @xmath346 the terms in the action in ( [ he2 ] ) will undergo a 90@xmath345 rotation under this transformation provided the integer heights @xmath317 transform as @xmath347 notice the all important @xmath348 in the last term  this compensates for the ` branch cut ' in the values of the offsets @xmath320 as one goes around a plaquette in fig  [ fig9]c . from ( [ hf2 ] ) , it is evident that the average height @xmath349 under the 90@xmath345 rotation symmetry under consideration here .",
    "hence , a smooth interface with a well - defined value of @xmath343 _ always _ breaks this symmetry .",
    "we now make this somewhat abstract discussion more physical by presenting a simple interpretation of the interface model in the language of the @xmath0 antiferromagnet @xcite . from fig",
    "[ fig9]a it is clear that nearest neighbor heights can differ either by 1/4 or 3/4 ( modulo integers ) . to minimize the action in ( [ he1 ] ) , we should choose the interface with the largest possible number of steps of @xmath350 .",

    "each dimer on the direct lattice is associated with a step in height of @xmath351 on the link of the dual lattice that crosses it .",
    "all other height steps are @xmath350 .",
    "each dimer represents a singlet valence bond between the sites , as in fig  [ fig2].,width=192 ]    we identify each dimer with a singlet valence bond between the spins ( the ellipses in fig  [ fig2 ] ) , and so each interface corresponds to a quantum state with each spin locked in a singlet valence bond with a particular nearest neighbor .",
    "fluctuations of the interface in imaginary time between such configurations correspond to quantum tunneling events between such dimer states , and an effective hamiltonian for this is provided by the quantum dimer model @xcite .",
    "while such an interpretation in terms of the dimer model is appealing , we should also note that it is not as general as the dual interface model : on certain lattices , while the collinear paramagnetic state continues to have a representation as a dual interface model , there is no corresponding dimer interpretation @xcite .",

    ", the above mapping between interface heights and dimer coverings allows one to deduce that interfaces with average height @xmath352 ( modulo integers ) correspond to the four - fold degenerate bond - ordered states in fig  [ fig11]a .     on the square lattice : ( a ) the columnar spin - peierls states , and ( b ) plaquette state . here",
    "the distinct line styles encode the different values of the bond order parameter @xmath209 in ( [ bondorder ] ) on the links .",

    "note compactness on its own is a relevant perturbation which can not be ignored _",

    "the _ combined _ effects of compactness and berry phases are therefore _ dangerously irrelevant _ at @xmath362 .",
    "it is important to note that the critical theory of ( [ zc ] ) is distinct from the critical theory @xmath91 in ( [ sp ] ) , although both theories have a global o(3 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "in particular the values of the exponents @xmath372 are different in the two theories , and the scaling dimension of the nel order parameter @xmath338 under @xmath339 is distinct from the scaling dimension of the nel order parameter @xmath373 at the critical point of @xmath361 .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath361 in ( [ zc ] ) is a theory for the @xmath0 spinors @xmath337 .",

    "these spinons are confined into a @xmath32 quasiparticle once bond order appears for @xmath371 , for reasons similar to those illustrated in fig  [ fig3]b .    a key characteristic of this ` deconfined ' critical point is the irrelevance of the compactness of the gauge field , and hence of monopole tunnelling events .",
    "a consequence of this is that the flux of the @xmath365 gauge field in @xmath361 is conserved .",
    "this emergent conservation law , and the associated long - range gauge forces are key characteristics of such critical points .",

    ". the reader may also find it useful to look ahead to tables 1 and 2 , which summarize the intricate relationships between the models considered .",
    "this subsection describes a simplified lattice gauge theory model introduced by sachdev and jalabert @xcite .",
    "while the duality analysis presented below was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite , its correct physical interpretation , and the implications for more general models are due to senthil _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the model of interest in this subsection is the @xmath376 case of @xmath269 .",
    "physically , such a model will be appropriate for an antiferromagnet in the presence of a staggered magnetic field : such a field will prefer @xmath377 over @xmath378 ( say ) .",
    "so we write the preferred single component complex scalar simply as @xmath379 , and obtain from ( [ z ] ) @xmath380 we have chosen here to explicitly include a compact maxwell term for the gauge field , as that proves convenient in the description of the duality mappings . note that if we integrate out the @xmath381 for large @xmath280 , then we again obtain the model @xmath313 in ( [ f5 ] ) which was used to describe the paramagnetic phase in section  [ sec : para ] .",

    "as we have emphasized , @xmath382 features the combined complications of compactness and berry phases , essential for a proper description of quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "it is the simplest model in which it can be shown that these complications effectively neutralize one another at the critical point .    in the following subsection , we make things simpler for ourselves momentarily by dropping _ both _ the compactness and the berry phases",

    "[ [ a. ] ] a. + + +    dropping both compactness and berry phases , @xmath382 reduces to @xmath383 notice that the maxwell term for the gauge field now has a simple gaussian form .",
    "this is simply the lattice , classical , ginzburg - landau model ( or an xy model ) of a superconductor at finite temperatures coupled to electromagnetism .",
    "this model has been studied extensively in the past , and the key result was provided by dasgupta and halperin @xcite . as we review below , they showed that @xmath384 exhibited an _ inverted xy transition _ _",
    "i.e. _ it was dual to the theory of a complex scalar @xmath385 in the absence of a gauge field : @xmath386 the field @xmath385 is a creation operator for _ vortices _ in the original theory of the ginzburg - landau superconductor .",
    "these have a short - range interaction ( @xmath387 above ) because of the screening provided by the electromagnetic flux quantum attached to every vortex in ( [ zsc ] ) .",

    "the tuning parameter @xmath388 in ( [ zscd ] ) is ` inverted ' from the perspective of the direct theory : the @xmath389 phase with @xmath390 has a vortex condensate and so is the normal state of a ginzburg - landau superconductor , while the @xmath391 phase with @xmath392 has the vortices gapped as in the superconducting phase .",
    "we now provide a few steps in the analysis which links ( [ zsc ] ) to ( [ zscd ] ) .",
    "the steps are very similar to those described in section  [ sec : para ] below ( [ f5 ] ) and ( [ f6 ] ) .",
    "we write the cosine in ( [ zsc ] ) in its villain form , decouple it by the poisson summation formula using integer currents @xmath393 , and also decouple the maxwell term by a hubbard - stratonovich field @xmath394 ; this yields the analog of ( [ d1 ] ) for @xmath384 : @xmath395 the advantage of this form is that the integrals over @xmath381 and @xmath276 can be performed exactly , and they lead to the constraints @xmath396 we solve these constraints by writing @xmath397 where @xmath398 is an integer valued field on the links of the dual lattice , and @xmath399 is a real valued field on the sites of the dual lattice .",
    "this transforms ( [ zsc1 ] ) to @xmath400 precisely this dual form was obtained by dasgupta and halperin @xcite , and used by them for numerical simulations .",
    "we proceed further analytically , using methods familiar in the theory of duality mappings @xcite : we promote the integer valued @xmath401 to a real field by the poisson summation method , and introduce , by hand , a vortex fugacity @xmath402 .",
    "this transforms @xmath403 to @xmath404 notice that the effect of the vortex fugacity is to yield the least action when @xmath401 is an integer ( ignore @xmath405 momentarily ) : so we have effectively ` softened ' the integer constraint on @xmath401 .",
    "we have also introduced here a new real valued field @xmath405 on the sites of the dual lattice simply to make the @xmath406 invariant under u(1 ) gauge transformations of @xmath401 .",
    "this is mainly because the physics is clearer in this explicitly gauge - invariant form .",
    "we could , if we had wished , also chosen a gauge in which @xmath407 , and then the field @xmath405 would not be present in @xmath406 ( this justifies neglect of @xmath405 above ) . in the complete form in ( [ zsc3 ] ) , it is clear from the first two gaussian terms that fluctuations of the @xmath401 gauge field have been ` higgsed ' by the real field @xmath399 .",

    "@xcite , we now have to introduce _ two _ fugacities : a vortex fugacity @xmath402 ( as before ) , and a monopole fugacity @xmath414 ( discussed below ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath415 in ( [ zsc3 ] ) now takes the form @xmath416 again , the positions of the @xmath405 above are dictated by gauge invariance , and the effect of the vortex and monopole fugacities is to soften the integer value constraints on the @xmath401 and @xmath399 . proceeding as described below ( [ zsc3 ] ) , we work in the gauge @xmath417 , and to leading order in @xmath402 , @xmath414",

    "[ [ c. ] ] c. + + +    we are finally ready to face @xmath382 , and add in the final layer of complication of the berry phases .",

    "<S> this article contains a theoretical overview of the physical properties of antiferromagnetic mott insulators in spatial dimensions greater than one . </S>",
    "<S> many such materials have been experimentally studied in the past decade and a half , and we make contact with these studies . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest class of mott insulators have an even number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell , and these can be described with quantitative accuracy by the bond operator method : we discuss their spin gap and magnetically ordered states , and the transitions between them driven by pressure or an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the case of an odd number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell is more subtle : here the spin gap state can spontaneously develop bond order ( so the ground state again has an even number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell ) , and/or acquire topological order and fractionalized excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the conditions under which such spin gap states can form , and survey recent theories ( t. senthil _ et al . _ , cond - mat/0312617 ) of the quantum phase transitions among these states and magnetically ordered states . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the breakdown of the landau - ginzburg - wilson paradigm at these quantum critical points , accompanied by the appearance of emergent gauge excitations . </S>"
