    "superconductivity in pure and f - doped lafeaso with @xmath3 up to 26 k has opened a new frontier in the investigation of the novel superconducting materials and mechanisms.@xcite after an intensive study , superconductivity was discovered in several different type of iron - based materials , including reofepn ( re = rare earth ; pn = p or as , 1111-type),@xcite doped afe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( 122-type , a = ba , sr , ca),@xcite fe@xmath2as - type afeas ( 111-type , a = li or na),@xcite as well as anti - pbo - type fe(se , te ) ( 11-type).@xcite all have similar structure with the common feas - layer units .",
    "most undoped compounds are stripe - like antiferromagnetic ( spin density wave , sdw ) metals , and the magnetic ordering comes about simultaneously with the structural phase transition from tetragonal to orhtorhombic unit cell .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies suggests that the high-@xmath3 superconductivity in iron - based superconductors is influenced by proximity to sdw phase transition .",
    "the doping brings along charge carries that suppress the sdw ordering . it was suggested that the superconductivity may be established via inter - pocket scattering of electrons between the hole pockets and electron pockets , leading to the @xmath10 pairing.@xcite    thermal conductivity , thermoelectric power ( seebeck coefficient ) and specific heat , give some useful information about the fermi surface , electron - phonon coupling , pairing mechanism , and gap structure.@xcite . on the other hand , most iron - based superconductors exhibit significant seebeck coefficient , similar to the cobaltates ( such as na@xmath0coo@xmath2 ) and cuprates which have been widely studied for potential application .",
    "@xcite seebeck coefficient reaches about 90 @xmath11 in rfeaso@xmath12f@xmath0 and co - doped fese , rather close to values observed in na@xmath0coo@xmath2.@xcite    superconductivity with relatively high @xmath13 k was recently reported in a new series of iron - based superconductors a@xmath0fe@xmath2se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , cs , tl ) .",
    "@xcite these compounds are purely electron - doped and it is found that the superconductivity might be in proximity of a mott insulator.@xcite only electron pockets were observed in angle - resolved photoemission experiment without a hole fermi surface near the zone center in arpes experiment .",
    "@xcite just like other iron - based superconductors,@xcite superconductivity in a@xmath0fe@xmath2se@xmath2 is sensitive to the pn doping and anion height between fe and pn layers .",
    "sulfur doping at se sites suppresses the superconductivity @xcite and induces a spin glass narrow bandgap semiconductor ground state for complete s substitution on se sites .",
    "@xcite here we report the evolution of thermal transport properties of iron - based superconductor k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 with sulfur substitution .",
    "seebeck coefficient and the electron sommerfeld term in specific heat , are suppressed .",
    "this implies the suppression of density of states at the fermi energy and decrease in correlation strength .",
    "k@xmath0fe@xmath1s@xmath2 exhibits large seebeck coefficient at high temperature range which is attributed to the thermally activated carriers over the narrow bandgap .",
    "single crystals of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath14s@xmath15 were grown from nominal composition k : fe : se : s=0.8:2:2-@xmath16:@xmath16 with different s content , as described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the elemental analysis was performed using an energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) in a jeol jsm-6500 scanning electron microscope and following the actual sulfur contents are used .",
    "electrical and thermal transport measurements were conducted in quantum design ppms-9 .",
    "the crystal was cleaved to a rectangular shape with dimension 5@xmath172 mm@xmath18 in the _ ab_-plane and 0.3 mm thickness along the _ c_-axis .",
    "thermoelectric power and thermal conductivity were measured using one - heater - two - thermometer setup which allowed us to determine all transport properties of the crystal with steady - state method in quantum design ppms-9 .",
    "the heat and electrical current were transported within the _ ab_-plane of the crystal oriented by laue camera , with magnetic field along the _ c_-axis and perpendicular to the heat / electrical current .",
    "silver paint contacts were made directly on the crystal surface providing both good thermal contact and low electrical contact resistance .",
    "since air exposure exceeding 1 hour will result in the surface oxidization , the exposure to air of crystals was less than 20 minutes .",
    "the relative error in our measurement for both @xmath19 and @xmath20 was below @xmath21 based on ni standard measured under identical conditions .",

    "the specific heat measurements on all crystals can also give some useful information .",

    "application of 9 t magnetic field parallel to @xmath60-axis completely suppresses the superconductivity in crystal with @xmath29 and we obtain @xmath67 mj / mol k@xmath8 directly from linear fit of the low temperature @xmath61 vs @xmath57 in 9 t ( fig .",
    "4(d ) ) . for the crystals with @xmath30 and 2.0 , we derived the sommerfeld coefficient from specific heat under zero field ( fig .",
    "the results are shown in table i and fig .",
    "with increase of sulfur content the electron sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state is gradually suppressed .    according to ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,",
    "@xmath4 and the electron sommerfeld term in specific heat are related to the carrier density and the density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "since the sulfur has identical electronic configuration to selenium , there should be no change in the carrier concentration with sulfur doping because the elemental analysis is consistent with full occupancy of s(se ) sites.@xcite the absolute value of the dimensionless ratio of seebeck coefficient to specific heat @xmath68 with @xmath69 the avogadro number , gives the carrier density . from the values of @xmath4 and @xmath9",
    "obtained previously , we derived @xmath70 values for four superconducting crystals ( table i ) .",
    "the @xmath70 values do not exhibit significant change .",
    "therefore the suppress of @xmath4 and @xmath9 reflects a suppression of density of states at the fermi level or a change in the fermi surface .    the ratio of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 to fermi temperature @xmath52 gives information about the correlation strength in superconductors .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 for k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 implies a weakly correlated superconductor.@xcite with increase in sulfur content , the value of @xmath72 decreases as shown in table i. this implies a suppression of correlation strength .",
    "the effective mass , @xmath73 , derived from @xmath74 , is also suppressed with increase of s content ( table i ) , consistent with the decrease of correlation strength with s doping .",
    "in summary , we studied the evolution of thermal transport and thermodynamic properties of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath14s@xmath15 . the zero - temperature extrapolated value of seebeck coefficient @xmath4 is gradually suppressed , and then undergoes a sharp decrease at @xmath27 to a very small value ( @xmath6 0.03(2 ) @xmath7v / k@xmath8 ) for crystals with more sulfur content .",
    "the electron sommerfeld term ( @xmath9 ) in specific heat also decreases with increasing of sulfur content .",
    "the suppression of @xmath4 and @xmath9 reflects a suppression of density of states at the fermi level or a change of fermi surface near @xmath6 40@xmath75 sulfur doping level , possibly due to the change of the correlation strength .",
    "this coincides with the suppression of superconducting transition and shows that correlation effect might be important for superconducting @xmath3 in this material .",

    "<S> we report the evolution of thermal transport properties of iron - based superconductor k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 with sulfur substitution at se sites . </S>",
    "<S> sulfur doping suppresses the superconducting @xmath3 as well as the seebeck coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the seebeck coefficient of all crystals in the low temperature range can be described very well by diffusive thermoelectric response model . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - temperature extrapolated value of seebeck coefficient divided by temperature @xmath4 gradually decreases from @xmath5 to a very small value @xmath6 0.03 @xmath7v / k@xmath8 where @xmath3 is completely suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the normal state electron sommerfeld term ( @xmath9 ) of specific heat also decreases with the increase of sulfur content . </S>",
    "<S> the dcrease of @xmath4 and @xmath9 reflects a suppression of the density of states at the fermi energy , or a change in the fermi surface that would induce the suppression of correlation strength . </S>"
