    "one of the common processes to design polymeric materials ( including composites ) and to coat surfaces @xcite is to deposit polymer constituents on a desirable substrate and equilibrate .",
    "a driving ( biased ) field caused by electric field , pressure gradient , gravitation , spinning processes , etc . , is generally used to direct the deposition and control the morphological evolution . in dna gel electrophoresis for example , the chain macromolecules are driven by an electric field @xcite .",
    "the flow of dna molecules through pores and their accumulation at the pore boundaries along the flow direction depend on the magnitude of the flow field , molecular weight , and porosity ( i.e. , the size of the pores ) , etc . as the polymer chains deposit on an impenetrable substrate , the polymer density grows and an interface develops @xcite .",
    "the interface width defined by the longitudinal fluctuation in density profile is a measure of the roughness of the growing surface @xcite .",
    "enormous efforts have been devoted to understanding the conformation and density profiles at / near the surface ; the list of references is too large to cite them all , but we provide here a few examples @xcite without any preference .",
    "however , studies of the interface growth , conformation and density profile for the electrophoretic deposition of polymer chains on the impenetrable substrate @xcite are very limited",
    ". the characteristics of the density profile , growth of the interface width , and roughness depend on the deposition process , parameters such as driving field , temperature , and molecular weight , and the relaxation procedures .    since the polymer chains , driven by a field , deposit on an impenetrable substrate / wall , their conformational phase space at the substrate is constrained .",
    "the polymer density grows from the substrate as the deposition proceeds which leads to evolution of the bulk region adjacent to the substrate .",
    "distinct regimes emerge from initiating growth at the substrate toward the source at the opposite end from where the polymer chains are released : substrate , bulk , interface , and dilute solution .",
    "movement of chain segments , their relaxation , and degree of entanglement may vary from one regime to another .",
    "parameters such as temperature , molecular weight , field , and procedure such as segmental dynamics and relaxation may also affect the characteristics of these regimes .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to study how the polymer density varies from one region to the next and how it depends on these parameters .    while it is difficult to monitor and control deposition process , density profile , polymer conformation , etc . at the molecular scales in the laboratory ,",
    "computer simulation experiments can be implemented to examine these properties with simplified models @xcite . making quantitative predictions by analytical theories",
    "is severely limited in such a complex system involving different phases of material , interfaces , and relaxation at various scales .",
    "therefore , computer simulation experiments may be useful to gain insight into some of the difficult issues such as prediction of density profile and its dependence on molecular weight , field and temperature . in recent articles ,",
    "we have reported our analysis of the interface growth and its scaling @xcite . using the same computer simulation model on a discrete lattice",
    "we would like to study characteristics of the density profile and conformation of chains in this paper .",
    "model is presented in the next section followed by results and discussion in section 3 with a conclusion at the end .",
    "we consider a discrete lattice of size @xmath13 with a large aspect ratio @xmath14 .",
    "coarse - grained polymer chains , each of length @xmath15 ( i.e. , ( @xmath16 ) nodes connected by bonds ) are generated on trails of random walks along the lattice with excluded volume constraints toward the source end ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "an external field @xmath18 drives the chains toward the substrate ( impenetrable wall ) at @xmath19 .",
    "the change in energy due to the field @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the displacement of the chain node along @xmath22 direction .",
    "we also consider a nearest - neighbor polymer - polymer repulsive and polymer - wall attractive interaction , @xmath23 where @xmath24 if the site @xmath25 is occupied by the polymer node , @xmath26 if the site @xmath25 is empty , and @xmath27 if the empty site @xmath25 is on the substrate .",
    "the summation is restricted to nearest neighbor sites .",
    "chains are released at a constant rate ( typically one every hundred time steps ) and moved with the metropolis algorithm @xcite using a combination of segmental movements @xcite , i.e. , kink - jump , crankshaft @xcite , and slithering snake ( reptation ) dynamics .",
    "attempt to move each chain node once is defined as one monte carlo step ( mcs ) .",
    "the simulation is performed for a relatively large number of time steps for a sufficiently large number of independent samples to obtain a reliable estimate of the averaged physical quantities .",
    "polymer chains move from the source end toward the impenetrable substrate at the opposite end by the field ( @xmath18 ) using different segmental dynamics .",
    "kink jump dynamics involves movement of only one node and it is relatively slow and localized .",
    "therefore , it takes much longer to relax the polymer chains .",
    "crank - shaft involves movements of two nodes simultaneously , and it is faster than kink - jump but still localized to small part of chain s segment .",
    "slithering - snake ( reptation `` ) dynamics , on the other hand , involves global motion of the whole chain by altering conformations at the end segments . perhaps , a combination of these and other modes of segmental movements are desirable in many polymer simulations .",
    "we will , however , concentrate here with combinations of three segmental dynamics , ( @xmath25 ) kink - jump ( @xmath0 ) , ( @xmath28 ) kink - jump and crank - shaft ( @xmath3 ) , and ( @xmath29 ) kink - jump , crank - shaft , and reptation ( @xmath11 ) . apart from the segmental dynamics , a relaxation procedure @xciteis also implemented to equilibrate the polymer conformation and density . if we continue to deposit polymer chains and monitor the evolution of the density and conformational profiles , interface width , etc .",
    ", we reach a steady - state where these quantities approach their steady - state ( constant ) value in asymptotic time steps @xcite",
    ". however , if we stop releasing new chains after an appropriate , i.e. , desirable growth while allowing chains to execute their segmental moves , we find @xcite a considerable change in the interface width ( i.e. , the roughness ) .",
    "we have recently reported @xcite scaling behaviors of the relaxed '' interface width and pointed out the differences from their steady - state \" values . in this paper , we present our results of relaxed data for the density profile and conformation .",
    "most of our simulations are performed on a @xmath30 lattice with the size of polymer chains @xmath31 at various temperatures and fields . a number of independent samples @xmath32 are used to average the physical quantities .",
    "different lattice sizes are also used to check for the severe finite size effect and no significant difference is observed in the qualitative behavior of the physical quantities reported here .",
    "we have already reported the growth and scaling of the interface width including roughness in a series of papers in recent years @xcite by analyzing steady - state and relaxed interface width . in this article",
    "we concentrate on the characteristics of the density in various regimes .",
    "our data on the conformation of chains in these regimes have relatively large fluctuations and therefore , their qualitative analysis will be limited .    some studies for polymer melts near an impenetrable wall @xcite have indicated an oscillation in the density profile near the wall .",
    "other studies have shown a parabolic @xcite or hyperbolic @xcite decay in density with distance from the wall . for our simulations",
    "relaxed density profiles with @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath11 dynamics are presented in figs .",
    "1 - 3 , respectively , at the temperature @xmath33 for different driving fields .",
    "even though the chain lengths are different ( @xmath34 ) , the qualitative forms of their density profiles should be comparable for the following reason .",
    "we have examined the relaxed density profiles with different chain lengths @xmath35 and have found no significant difference in their density profile ( independent of chain length ) for any combination of the segmental dynamics we have studied here . a careful examination of these profiles ( figs . 1 - 3 )",
    ", however , reveals some differences due to segmental dynamics .",
    "figure 4 shows an example for such a comparison at @xmath36 with @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath11 segmental dynamics .",
    "we see that the polymer density in most regions ( particularly at the substrate and in the bulk ) is highest with the @xmath11 dynamics and lowest with the @xmath0 dynamics as it is slowest in relaxing the chains and is restricted to very short range local moves .",
    "reptation ( slithering - snake ) movements in @xmath11 dynamics involves long range fast movements which helps equilibrating the polymer density better than the short - range moves with @xmath0 and @xmath3 segmental dynamics .",
    "obviously , there is a profound effect of the field in orchestrating the shapes of the density profiles .",
    "a more specific examination will follow later .",
    "it is worth pointing out that we have not observed any sign of oscillations in density profiles as observed with the steady - state density profiles with a combination of kink - jump and reptation dynamics @xcite .",
    "further , there is clogging with the kink - jump segmental dynamics alone particularly at higher values of field ( @xmath37 , see fig .  1 ) . with clogging ,",
    "the rate of polymer deposition on the substrate is hard to monitor and different from that without clogging .",
    "such a problem with the @xmath0 segmental dynamics is also reported in study of the interface growth and its scaling . in the following we restrict most of our analysis to @xmath3 and @xmath11 dynamics where the clogging is",
    "not a problem for the range of parameters we have explored here .",
    "thus , mixing different segmental movements along with relaxation ( without additional deposition ) is important in relaxing the polymer chains , avoiding the clogging , equilibrating the density distribution , and reducing the probability of layering in density profile of driven polymer deposition .",
    "figure 5 shows the density profiles at different temperatures with @xmath3 and @xmath11 segmental dynamics at a fixed field @xmath38 .",
    "again we see the differences due to segmental dynamics along with the effect of temperature , which is revisited later .",
    "let us examine the characteristics of density in each region , i.e. , substrate ( @xmath39 ) , bulk ( between substrate and the interface ) , interface , and dilute solution ( fluid ) , of the density profile .",
    "polymer density in bulk is referred to as the volume fraction and density at the substrate as the coverage , the fraction of sites covered by the polymer .",
    "figure 6 shows the growth of coverage with @xmath3 segmental dynamics .",
    "note that the coverage , @xmath7 , grows rather fast initially followed by a slow growth before reaching its saturation , the asymptotic value also known as jamming coverage .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the approach to jamming coverage for objects of different shapes and sizes has been notoriously slow and extensively studied @xcite . while the substrate coverage in steady - state polymer deposition shares the slow approach to the asymptotic ( jamming ) limit , equilibration by relaxing chains enhances the probability of approaching the jamming limit substantially . in the pre - asymptotic regime ,",
    "growth of the coverage seems to grow with a power law ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , @xmath40 with an exponent @xmath41 .",
    "the coverage growth exponent @xmath41 is found to depend on the field ( see fig .  8) , @xmath42 and is therefore , non - universal .",
    "relaxed densities in the bulk , i.e. , the volume fraction @xmath6 and the substrate coverage @xmath7 depend on the field in low field regime ( @xmath43 ) as seen in fig .",
    "the volume fraction and the coverage increase with the field exponentially and become constant at their maximum values at high fields .",
    "the polymer density at the interface @xmath10 , on the other hand , is found to increase with the field with a power law ( see fig 10 ) .",
    "best fits of our data suggest , @xmath44 the response of polymer density to field in the low field regime seems to be stronger with the relaxed system here than the corresponding response with a steady - state simulation .",
    "the interface polymer density also seems to increase with the molecular weight .",
    "best fit of our data in fig .",
    "11 leads to , @xmath45 it is worth mentioning that a similar trend for the dependence of volume fraction and coverage on the field is also observed with the kink - jump dynamics except the range of field for the growth of density is reduced .",
    "we have also analyzed the temperature dependence of polymer densities in these regions ( substrate , bulk , interface ) .",
    "generally , the density decreases with the temperature .",
    "the substrate coverage and the bulk volume fraction show a larger rate of decay than the polymer density at the interface .",
    "volume fraction in bulk shows the largest variation with the temperature for the @xmath11 segmental dynamics as shown in fig .",
    "best fits of our data in high temperature regime show , @xmath46 since the conformation of polymer chains at the substrate and in the bulk are more restricted due to the presence of neighboring chains and their entanglement , increasing the temperature further reduces the conformational entropy .",
    "thus we are able to characterize the dependence of volume fraction and substrate coverage on field , temperature and the molecular weight .",
    "the bulk density is found to decay with the molecular weight as shown in fig .  13 , @xmath47 note that the decay of bulk density with the molecular weight shows a similar pattern with steady state simulation with @xmath11 segmental dynamics .",
    "exponential decay is observed with a steady - state simulation involving reptation and kink - jump .",
    "we know that it is difficult to pack many chains in a limited volume due to steric hindrance .",
    "the larger the chain length the fewer the chains are needed to reach the jamming limit .",
    "the percolation threshold @xcite of chains and its jamming volume fraction have been found @xcite to decay with the chain length in the percolation of chains .",
    "our result seems consistent with the percolation of chains .",
    "we have also analyzed the conformation of polymer chains . in general , our data for the conformational profiles are more fluctuating than corresponding density profiles . therefore , at present , we are unable to draw more meaningful conclusion that what is presented here .",
    "figure 14 shows the variation of the radius of gyration of chains at the interface , substrate , and in the bulk , with the chain length on a log - log scale .",
    "we see that the transverse component of @xmath48 scales with the molecular weight with , @xmath49 the total radius of gyration shows a gaussian scaling , @xmath50 the longitudinal component saturates at higher molecular weight as chains compress .",
    "electrophoretic deposition of polymer chains on an impenetrable substrate is examined by a computer simulation model on a discrete lattice . a combination of different segmental dynamics is used to relax the polymer chains and monitor the density profile .",
    "we find that the relaxation of polymer chains , density , and the interface width depend on the segmental dynamics , molecular weight , field , and temperature .",
    "the combination of slow - to - fast segmental dynamics is highly desirable to equilibrate our system effectively in our observation time .",
    "different spatial regions of the material evolved from the polymer deposition , substrate , bulk , and the interface are identified and their physical properties are analyzed .",
    "we are able to make a number of quantitative predictions regarding the dependence of relaxed density and conformation of chains in these regions based on our data .",
    "we have found that there is very little ( negligible ) effect of molecular weight on the the relaxed density profiles both with @xmath3 and @xmath11 segmental dynamics . with the @xmath3",
    "segmental dynamics , we find that the substrate coverage in the pre - saturation regime grows with a power law with a nonuniversal exponent @xmath41 ( eqs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "bulk volume fraction ( @xmath6 ) and the jamming substrate coverage grow exponentially with the field ( eq .",
    "the interface polymer density ( @xmath10 ) increases linearly with the molecular weight ( eq .",
    "6 ) .    with the @xmath11 dynamics , we are able to attain better defined distinct density regions with relatively less fluctuations . both bulk volume fraction and substrate coverage are found to decay linearly with the temperature in the high - temperature regime .",
    "the bulk density decays with the molecular weight with a power law exponent 0.11 ( eq .",
    "the radius of gyration exhibits a gaussian conformation in almost all regions . while the transverse component of the radius of gyration scales with an exponent ( 0.6 ) similar to that of a self - avoiding walk ,",
    "the longitudinal components seem to saturates with higher molecular weight .",
    "further large scale simulations are needed to clarify the conformational profile ."
