    "the nematic  smectic phase transition is among the most interesting phenomena in liquid crystals .",
    "this is one of a few examples of a _ partial _ breaking of translational symmetry : the system in smectic state has a layered structure , while the translational symmetry along the in  layer directions is preserved .",
    "it is believed that normally the physical origin of the transition to the smectic phase is the non  uniform architecture of the consistuent particles , such that the nematic ",
    "smectic transition can be interpreted as a microphase separation of different parts of the molecules . nevertheless , it is conceptually important to realize that a non  trivial structure of the constituent objects is not a necessary condition for the formation of smectic .",
    "both analytical and numerical investigations show that an entropy  driven nematic  to  smectic phase transition occurs even in the system of uniform rigid rods @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recent experiments with rod  like viruses have confirmed the predictions of such theories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they also showed that a dramatic change in behavior takes place due to the finite flexibility of viruses .",
    "in particular , the transition turns out to be of the strong first order rather than of weak  crystallization type typical for most smectics .",
    "in addition , the volume fraction at the transition is considerably higher in the case of flexible chains than for rods .",
    "the chains are strongly localized within the layers , so that the periodicity of the smectic phase is nearly equal to the length of an individual stretched chain , while in the stiff - rod case it is longer than the length of a rod because of a weaker localization .    in a recent communication @xcite",
    "we have proposed a theory based on the tube  model for the description of the nematic ",
    "smectic phase transition in the system of uniform semi  flexible chains with hard  core repulsion .",
    "this model has been shown to capture all the experimentally ",
    "observed features of the transition . in this paper",
    "we elaborate our approach by relating the tube ",
    "model calculation to a general density  functional formalism .",
    "it is shown that the strong first order character of the transition and the equivalence of the smectic period to the chain length follow from a general form of the density functional of the system .",
    "the strategy of the work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the density functional approach to the nematic ",
    "smectic transition . in section 3",
    "we derive the general form of the free energy of semi ",
    "flexible chains expressed as a functional of the density of their mid  points .",
    "the breakdown of the stability condition ( positivity of the inverse structure factor ) yields the limit of stability of the nematic phase and the critical wave vector of the modulation bifurcation . in section 3",
    "we obtain the parameters of the density functional from the tube model of the nematic state .",
    "this allows one to determine the parameters of the transition for various chain lengths .",
    "the structure of the theory allows one to understand the difference between the behavior of semi ",
    "flexible chains and that of rigid rods .",
    "a powerful tool for the description of various types of crystallization , and in particular , of the nematic ",
    "smectic phase transition is the density  functional approach . within such theories the free energy @xmath0 of the system",
    "is parameterized by the one  particle density , @xmath1 . the thermodynamic stability ( or at least meta ",
    "stability ) of the spatially uniform ( e.g. , nematic ) phase with respect to density modulation is controlled by the sign of the corresponding second variation of the free energy :    @xmath2    note that @xmath3 has the meaning of the inverse structure factor in the nematic phase ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the system becomes unstable with respect to the transition to a spatially modulated ( smectic ) state , when inequality ( [ con ] ) is violated at a certain finite wave vector , @xmath5 .",
    "in many cases the nematic  smectic transition can be successfully described within the weak crystallization theory @xcite . in this approach",
    "one assumes that near the transition , the local deviations of the density field are dominated by one or by several critical density waves , i.e. @xmath6 here @xmath7 are the critical wave vectors .",
    "the spatial dependence of the @xmath8component order parameter @xmath9 is supposed to be much slower than the critical density modulation itself .",
    "the landau ",
    "type expansion of the free energy in terms of this order parameter is the essence of the weak crystallization approach : @xmath10 the translational symmetry of the free energy demands that any term in the above expansion is a combination of density waves with zero total wave vector .",
    "note that a large third  order term in this expansion would result in a strong first order transition and thus would violate the requirement of smallness of the order parameter .",
    "therefore , the weak crystallization theory is adequate only for the cases when the third  order term is zero or small . in particular , its applicability to the nematic ",
    "smectic phase transition is normally justified by the broken rotational symmetry of the nematic phase . indeed , in the rotationally ",
    "symmetric case , the critical wave vectors would lie on the sphere of radius @xmath11 , and one could choose three critical density waves with zero total wave vector .",
    "therefore , rotational symmetry implies that there is a non ",
    "zero cubic term in expansion ( [ weak ] ) . in the case of the nematic ",
    "smectic transition the degeneracy in the orientation of the critical wave vector is lifted , and one can not construct a third  order combination of the critical density waves . hence , the weak crystallization theory can usually be applied to this transition .    as an example , consider the transition to the smectic state in the system of perfectly aligned hard rods .",
    "the density  functional theory , developed for this system in reference @xcite , shows that its basic physics can be successfully described even in the second virial approximation :    @xmath12    which yields the following simple expression for the inverse structure factor : @xmath13 here we are interested only in the wave vectors parallel to the nematic director , @xmath14 .",
    "the breakdown of the stability condition corresponds to the transition to the spatially  modulated smectic phase . since the instability is dominated by a single density wave ( with @xmath15 )",
    ", the transition in the hard  rod system is of the _ weak  crystallization _ type .",
    "this means that the smectic modulation of hard rods is weak near the transition point . as a result ,",
    "the normal  to  layer fluctuations of the rods are of the order of their length @xmath16 , consistent with the fact that the corresponding period @xmath17 differs considerably from @xmath16 .",
    "although within the model of freely  rotating rods @xcite , @xcite the phase transition turns out to be of the first order , it is so weak that the transition can hardly be distinguished experimentally from a second  order one .      consider a system of worm  like uniform chains of length @xmath16 with hard core diameter @xmath18 .",
    "the single  chain hamiltonian for a given conformation @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) has the form    @xmath21    here @xmath22 is the coordinate along the chain contour and @xmath23 is a unit tangent vector .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is the persistence length of the chain in the isotropic phase . in the nematic phase , however , there are two different scales which play the role of persistence length @xcite",
    ". one of them is the typical distance between  hairpins  , the points at which the tangent vector changes its direction by b@xmath25 .",
    "this length becomes exponentially large for high enough nematic order parameter and we assume here that it exceeds the chain length , i. e. the conformations of the chains are straight lines with only weak transverse fluctuations of the tangent vector about the nematic director .",
    "the correlations of these transverse fluctuations are determined by another length scale known as the deflection length , @xmath26 .",
    "this scale , which is smaller then the bare persistence length @xmath24 , determines the thermodynamics of the system ( the free energy can be estimated as @xmath27 per chain segment of length @xmath28 ) .",
    "we now have to express the free energy as a functional of the density of the chains centers ,    @xmath29    if the chains were infinite , the conformational free energy averaged over scales larger then @xmath26 would be a local functional of the volume fraction . for finite chains",
    "there is also a translational entropy contribution and a correction due to finite density of chain ends : @xmath30 because of the low density of chain ends , @xmath31 , their effect is accounted for in the above expression by a term linear in @xmath31 , coupled to some local function of the volume fraction . since the chains are strongly stretched along the nematic director , @xmath32axis , and do not form  hairpins  , one can relate the local density of the ends @xmath33 and the local volume fraction of chains @xmath34 to the density field @xmath35 ( we will not consider any fluctuations of these fields in the plane normal to @xmath32 ) : @xmath36    @xmath37    due to these non  trivial relationships between the three fields @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the above local free energy functional is becomes non ",
    "local when expressed in terms of a single density field , @xmath41 .",
    "such non  local properties of the density functional are necessary for the description of the nematic ",
    "smectic transition .",
    "the semi  flexible chains are unique in that sense that this functional has a well - defined general form dictated by the property of locality on the mesoscopic scales ( below @xmath16 and above @xmath26 ) .    in order to study the stability of the nematic state",
    "consider the second variation of the free energy at the fixed average volume fraction @xmath42 ( and the corresponding density @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the volume of a single chain ) :    @xmath45    performing the fourier transform of all the fields under consideration ( along the @xmath32axis , neglecting their variations in other directions ) and expressing these fields in terms of the density deviations , @xmath46 , we obtain the following diagonalized free energy : @xmath47\\ ] ] here the dimensionless parameter @xmath48 and the length @xmath49 are certain functions of the average volume fraction , but not of the chain length or wave vector . note the universality of the @xmath50dependence of the inverse structure factor for semi ",
    "flexible chains : @xmath51   \\label{st - fac}\\ ] ] before proceeding with the discussion of this general form of @xmath52 , we present a simple model which yields the microscopic expressions for the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 appearing in ( [ st - fac ] ) .",
    "the interactions of a chain with its neighbors can be modeled by confining it in an effective tube .",
    "if the system is dense enough , it can be viewed as a close  packed array of such tubes .",
    "this means that the average tube diameter in the vicinity of some point @xmath55 , is @xmath56 , where @xmath39 is the local volume fraction .",
    "therefore , the allowed amplitude of fluctuations of a chain within the tube is @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding conformational free energy of the chain can be evaluated in the gaussian approximation , with the confinement imposed by a fictitious external field .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath58 per correlation length @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "note that one can obtain this result , up to a numerical coefficient , from simple scaling arguments , since @xmath60 can be identified with a typical contour length between two reflections of the chain from the tube walls .",
    "we conclude that the conformational free energy per unit volume is determined by the field @xmath61 :",
    "@xmath62    we assume that the dominant effect responsible for the smectic ordering is that the _ internal parts of the chains can not occupy a  shadow ",
    "region in the vicinity of a free end_. this is a particular realization of the _ correlation hole effect _ , @xcite . in the extreme case of perfectly aligned rigid rods",
    "the space behind the edge of one rod can be filled only by the complementary end part of another one ( see figure 1a ) . however , in the system of semi ",
    "flexible chains the size of the  shadow  region can be reduced by appropriate readjustments of the conformations of the neighboring chains , as shown in figure 1b .",
    "the screening of the  shadow  region can be described by a _ screening length _ @xmath63 . the conformational free energy penalty for the creation of the free space near the edge of every chain is given by the product of the local transverse pressure @xmath64 and the typical volume of the  shadow  region @xmath65@xmath66@xmath67 .",
    "here @xmath65 is a geometrical factor of order of unity . approximating the shape of a typical  shadow  region with a cone , one obtains @xmath68 . the typical bending energy associated with",
    "the distortion of chain contour needed for the screening of the `` shadow region '' is @xmath69 per chain involved . the screening length and the energy of the end defect",
    "is determined by the balance between the osmotic energy penalty and the bending energy , i.e. they can be obtained by minimization of the following free energy : @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the effective number of the distorted chains ( fortunately , the final result is nearly insensitive to the choise of this parameter ) .",
    "the minimal value of the above free energy is given by @xmath72 the correspondong optimal screening length is @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the fundamental length scale of the problem . up to a @xmath75dependent factor , it determines both the screening length and the correlation length @xmath76 discussed earlier . for practical purposes ,",
    "the screening length can be taken roughly equal to @xmath77 .",
    "note that our estimate of the energy of the end defect is somewhat different from the one described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on elasticity theory .",
    "elastic approach neglects the energy penalty associated with the non - zero osmotic pressure @xmath78 , which in our case turns out to be considerably stronger then next  order elastic corrections . nevertheless , the very notion of the effective attractin between chain ends discussed in the present paper is conceptually close to the one in ref .",
    "@xcite .    depending on the total chain length",
    ", one can distinguish between two qualitatively different limiting regimes . if @xmath79 , the screening effect is not significant and the chains can be considered as rigid rods .",
    "here , we consider the opposite limit , @xmath80 , when the total volume fraction of the  shadow  regions is low and one can neglect their overlap in the spatially  uniform nematic phase .",
    "summarizing the above calculation one can write down the total free energy of the system : @xmath81 @xmath82 the first term accounts for the translational entropy of the chains , the second one represents the bulk conformational free energy of infinitely long chains and the last term is due to the end anomalies .",
    "one can easily verify that our model free energy has the general form obtained in the previous section , ( [ free en ] ) .",
    "there is a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between the three discussed contributions to the free energy and the three terms in the following expression for the inverse structure factor in the uniform nematic phase , as a function of the average volume fraction @xmath42 : @xmath83 \\right)\\ ] ]    this expression has exactly the same general structure as has been derived in the previous section .",
    "the uniform nematic is stable ( or at least metastable ) with respect to the transition to the spatially  modulated ( smectic ) state as long as the calculated inverse structure factor is positive .",
    "the end effect contribution is the only term in expression ( [ str ] ) which may be negative ( due to the sign  changing factor @xmath84 ) . for most wave vectors",
    ", however , this term can not change the overall sign of the structure factor because of the dominant positive conformational contribution , which contains the large factor @xmath85 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the  shadow  regions are _ screened _ in the many  chain system , and",
    "the corresponding end effect is just a small correction to the conformational free energy .",
    "this correction is important only in the vicinity of the zeros of the expression @xmath86 , which determines the @xmath87dependence of the bulk conformational contribution to the inverse structure factor .",
    "we conclude that the modulation instability in the system is expected only for nearly @xmath16periodic density waves , which are the zero modes of the conformational term .",
    "one can expand the inverse structure factor in the vicinity of such wave vectors , @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) : @xmath90 \\right)\\ ] ] its minima are the candidates for the critical wave vector of the modulation instability : @xmath91 the control parameter @xmath42 at which @xmath92 turns out to be independent of @xmath8 ( up to a cut  off @xmath93 where the small@xmath94 expansion becomes inadequate ) : @xmath95",
    "the existence of the family of critical wave vectors ( [ fam ] ) which differ only by integer multiplier is the signature of _  the first  order phase transition _ to the smectic state . indeed , unlike the case of a _ single _ dominating density wave typical for most smectics ( e.g. for rigid rods ) , this _ degeneracy _ enables one to compose the third  order combinations of the critical modes ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) , which contribute to the term @xmath98 in the density  deviation expansion of the free energy , ( [ weak ] ) . the non  zero cubic term in the landau expansion is known to result in a first  order transition .",
    "the common period of all the critical modes is @xmath99 in a general case this critical period can differ from that of the equilibrium modulated phase .",
    "nevertheless , the above result suggests that the period of the smectic @xmath49 nearly coincides with the chain ",
    "length @xmath16 , and that the small correction @xmath100 is of order of @xmath101 .",
    "this correction determines both the typical gap between well  formed smectic layers and the typical longitudinal fluctuations of the chains in these layers .",
    "this is consistent with the observations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which the calculated length @xmath102 is of the order of the measured correction to the period @xmath103 .",
    "the effective hard core diameter in the experiments can be estimated as the inter ",
    "chain separation at which the electrostatic repulsion becomes of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "this length depends on the ionic strength , so it was possible to change it independently of the particle density . since @xmath104 depends on the hard core diameter @xmath18 , the measured points on the phase diagram ( concentration  ionic strength ) can be transformed to the coordinates of our theory(@xmath105 ",
    "@xmath106 ) . the calculated spinodal volume fraction , eq.([volfr ] )",
    "is in an agreement with the experimental value , which is about @xmath107 for @xmath108 in the range from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "note that the chain  length dependence of the critical volume fraction is rather weak , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "we now compare the results obtained for semi  flexible chains with those for perfectly  aligned rigid rods .",
    "consider the inverse structure factor of perfectly  aligned rigid rods , eq .",
    "( [ str1 ] ) :    @xmath111 the first term here is due to translational entropy and the second one is the excluded volume contribution , which is essentially the  shadow  region end effect .",
    "naturally , the rigid  rod structure factor does not contain the conformational contribution , which dominates the similar expression for semi  flexible chains . hence , the  shadow ",
    "region effect , which drives for the nematic  to ",
    "smectic transition is no longer a small correction . as a result , the transition in the system of rods takes place at a lower volume fraction , which is @xmath112 within the second virial approximation , eq .",
    "( [ str1 ] ) . taking the higher virial terms into account",
    "changes this value to @xmath113 .",
    "if the rods are freely rotating , the critical volume fraction depends on the length  to  diameter ratio . for long enough chains ( @xmath114 ) the transition volume fraction reachs a `` universal '' value @xmath115 @xcite , @xcite . in the case of considerable flexibility of the  molecules  , the critical ( spinodal ) volume fraction given by expression ( [ volfr ] ) is not constant even for high length  to  diameter ratio , since the relavant parameter here is @xmath106 , rather than @xmath116 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the typical behavior of the inverse structure factors for rigid rods , eq .",
    "( [ str1 ] ) , and semi  flexible chains , eq . ( [ str ] ) , are depicted in figure 3 . unlike the case of semi ",
    "flexible chains ( @xmath80 ) , in which the @xmath117degeneracy of the bifurcation point results in a strong first  order transition , the deepest minimum of the rigid  rod inverse structure factor determines a _ single _ critical wave vector of the modulation instability .",
    "this explains why the nematic  smectic transition for rigid rods is much softer then for semi  flexible chains",
    ".    another important implication of the theory is the effect of polydispersity .",
    "since the inverse structure factor describes the effective two  body interactions , expressions ( [ str ] ) and ( [ str1 ] ) can be extended to the polydisperse case by replacing a single parameter @xmath16 with the mean length of two interacting particles @xmath118 , and averaging over the distribution of lengths .",
    "the polydispersity acts against the modulation instability , because it reduces the depth of minima of the inverse structure factor .",
    "hence , the critical volume fraction is expected to increase with polydispersity for both chains and rods . however , while the smectic phase can form in systems of rods with quite broad distribution of lengths @xcite , the typical deviation of the chain ",
    "length , which completely suppresses the transition in systems of chains is of the order of @xmath119 .",
    "thus , in order to observe the smectic phase in the system of chains the distribution of lengths has to be very narrow .    it should be noted that although we have shown that the above behavior follows from a very general form of the density functional for semi ",
    "flexible chains , our formalism can not be directly applied to the case of long  range ( hexagonal ) in  layer structure . in that case , a chain end becomes a real topological defect , and there is no reason to expect that the corresponding energy penalty is finite , i. e. , that the corresponding contribution to the total free energy , eq .",
    "( [ free en ] ) , is linear in the chain  end density .    in summary ,",
    "the theory of nematic ",
    "smectic phase transition for uniform semi  flexible chains with hard  core repulsion has been developed .",
    "similarly to the case of rigid rods , the transition is driven by the  shadow ",
    "region end effect .",
    "the difference is that due to the finite flexibility of the chains this effect is screened and the size of the empty space near a free end is limited by the screening length @xmath120 . the presence of  shadow  regions yields just a small correction to the conformational free energy which stabilizes the spatially uniform nematic state . as a result ,",
    "the spinodal volume fraction for flexible chains is much higher than for rigid rods .",
    "this trend is consistent with the experiments as well as with the recent theory of weakly flexible rods @xcite .",
    "the modulation instability of the nematic state can appear only for nearly @xmath16periodic density waves , which are the soft modes of the bulk conformational free energy .",
    "therefore , unlike the rigid  rod case , the period of the smectic phase near the transition point almost coincides with the chain length @xmath16 .",
    "another important difference is that in the case of semi ",
    "flexible chains the point of modulation instability is highly degenerate in the critical wave vector resulting in a strong first  order phase transition .",
    "the theory also implies that the flexibility of the chains results in higher sensitivity of the transition to polydispersity .",
    "the agreement of the theory with existing experimental data confirms that it captures the basic physics of the phenomenon .",
