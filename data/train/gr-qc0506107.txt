    "a longstanding problem in general relativity has been to find the general behavior of singularities .",
    "several results , both analytical@xcite and numerical@xcite have been obtained .",
    "though most of the results are for the case where the spacetimes have one or more symmetries , recent work has been done on the general case where there are no symmetries.@xcite there is a longstanding conjecture@xcite due to belinski , lifschitz and khalatnikov ( bkl ) that states that the generic singularity is spacelike and local .",
    "this conjecture has been reformulated and put more precisely by uggla _",
    "et al_.@xcite the type of local dynamics conjectured by bkl depends on the type of matter . for vacuum and for many types of matter , the bkl conjecture is that the local dynamics is oscillatory , corresponding to the dynamics of a bianchi type ix spacetime .",
    "however , for stiff fluid ( _ i.e. _ fluid with pressure equal to energy density ) the bkl conjecture is that the local dynamics is asymptotically velocity term dominated corresponding to the dynamics of a bianchi type i spacetime . the vacuum version of the bkl conjecture has been supported by the numerical simulations of @xcite which show local and oscillatory dynamics in vacuum spacetimes with no symmetry",
    ". the stiff fluid version of the bkl conjecture has been supported by the theorem of andersson and rendall@xcite which shows the local existence in a neighborhood of the singularity of solutions of the einstein equations with stiff fluid matter with the expected asymptotic behavior and with enough degrees of freedom to be the generic solutions . what is not known is whether generic stiff fluid initial data evolves to a solution of the andersson and rendall class .    to address this issue",
    ", we perform numerical simulations of the approach to the singularity for stiff fluid matter with no symmetries .",
    "our methods are those of @xcite using the system of @xcite .",
    "section ii presents the equations and numerical methods used .",
    "the results are given in section iii and conclusions in section iv .",
    "the system evolved here is essentially that of reference@xcite but specialized to the stiff fluid case and with a slightly different choice of gauge . here",
    "the spacetime is described in terms of a coordinate system ( @xmath0 ) and a tetrad ( @xmath1 ) where both the spatial coordinate index @xmath2 and the spatial tetrad index @xmath3 go from 1 to 3 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath4 is hypersurface orthogonal and that the relation between tetrad and coordinates is of the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the lapse and we have chosen the shift to be zero .",
    "we choose the spatial frame @xmath8 to be fermi propagated along the integral curves of @xmath4 .",
    "the commutators of the tetrad components are decomposed as follows : @xmath9 & = & { { \\dot u}_\\alpha}{{\\bf e}_0 } -(h { { \\delta _ \\alpha}^\\beta } + { { \\sigma _ \\alpha}^\\beta } ) { { \\bf e}_\\beta }   \\label{com0i } \\\\ \\left [ { { \\bf e}_\\alpha } , { { \\bf e}_\\beta } \\right ]   & = & ( 2 { a_{[\\alpha}}{{\\delta _ { \\beta ] } } ^\\gamma } + { \\epsilon _ { \\alpha \\beta \\delta } } { n^{\\delta \\gamma}}){{\\bf e}_\\gamma } \\label{comij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is symmetric , and @xmath11 is symmetric and trace free .",
    "square brackets denote the antisymmetric part of a tensor .",
    "define @xmath12 and @xmath13 , that is @xmath14 is the timelike vector of the tetrad and @xmath15 is the spatial metric corresponding to the choice of @xmath14 as the time direction .",
    "then the stress - energy tensor can be decomposed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are orthogonal to @xmath14 and where @xmath18 is symmetric and trace - free .",
    "round brackets denote the symmetric part of a tensor .",
    "scale invariant variables are defined as follows : @xmath19    the matter variables are not all independent , because we assume that the stress - energy is that of a stiff fluid @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the rest frame energy density of the fluid and @xmath22 is the fluid four - velocity , which can be decomposed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is orthogonal to @xmath14 .",
    "comparison of equations ( [ generalstress ] ) and ( [ stiffstress ] ) yields @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 and angle brackets denote the symmetric trace - free part of a tensor .",
    "thus , all scale invariant matter variables can be expressed in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "finally choose the lapse to be @xmath30 .",

    "we use the york method@xcite which begins by defining the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 by @xmath50 we choose @xmath51 to be constant , @xmath48 to be the flat metric @xmath52 and @xmath53 to vanish . with these choices , equations ( [ cmom ] ) and ( [ cham ] )",
    "become @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the ordinary derivative with respect to cartesian coordinates and indicies are raised and lowered with @xmath52 .",
    "we choose space to have topology @xmath56 with the cartesian coordinates @xmath57 and @xmath58 each going from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "we choose the following solution of equation ( [ ymom ] ) @xmath61 with the off - diagonal components of @xmath49 vanishing . here",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants .",
    "note that due to the periodicity of the coordinates and the linearity of equation ( [ ymom ] ) the general solution of equation ( [ ymom ] ) is a fourier series .",
    "the solution that we choose is then essentially the simplest solution of equation ( [ ymom ] ) without symmetries .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 can be freely specified and we choose it to be @xmath64 where the @xmath65 are constants . with these choices for @xmath49 and @xmath46 , equation ( [ yham ] ) is solved numerically ( in a manner to be described later ) to yield @xmath66 and therefore @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    from this initial data",
    ", we must then produce the initial values of the scale invariant variables . from equation ( [ com0i ] ) it follows that @xmath67 and since @xmath68 is constant it then follows that @xmath69 vanishes . since the initial spatial metric is conformally flat , we choose the initial spatial tetrad vectors by @xmath70 it then follows from equation ( [ comij ] ) that @xmath71 vanishes and that @xmath72 from equation ( [ com0i ] ) it then follows that @xmath73 while @xmath74 is given by equation ( [ si5 ] ) and @xmath75 by the vanishing of equation ( [ cn4 ] ) .",
    "the numerical method used is as follows : each spatial direction corresponds to @xmath76 grid points with spacing @xmath77 .",
    "the variables on grid points @xmath78 to @xmath79 are evolved using the evolution equations , while at points @xmath80 and @xmath76 periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the initial data is determined once equation ( [ yham ] ) is solved .",
    "this is done iteratively as follows:@xcite define @xmath81 then equation ( [ yham ] ) takes the form @xmath82 .",
    "we make an initial guess @xmath83 for @xmath84 and solve using the conjugate gradient method @xcite the equation @xmath85 iterating until @xmath86 satisfies equation ( [ yham ] ) to within a set tolerance .",
    "the evolution proceeds using equations ( [ ev1]-[ev8 ] ) with the exception that the term @xmath87 is added to the right hand side of equation ( [ ev8 ] ) to prevent the growth of constraint violating modes and the term @xmath88 is added to the right hand side of equation ( [ ev3 ] ) to make the system well posed.@xcite spatial derivatives are evaluated using centered differences , and the evolution is done using a three step iterated crank - nicholson method@xcite ( a type of predictor - corrector method ) . in equation ( [ ev8 ] )",
    "the highest spatial derivative term is @xmath89 which gives this equation the form of a diffusion equation .",
    "note that diffusion equations can only be evolved in one direction in time , in this case the negative direction which corresponds to the approach to the singularity .",
    "stability of numerical evolution of diffusion equations generally requires a time step proportional to the square of the spatial step .",
    "however , the constant of proportionality depends on the coefficient of the second spatial derivative . to ensure stability , we define @xmath90 to be the maximum value of @xmath91 ( over all space and over all @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) and then define @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the time step @xmath94 is then chosen to be whichever of @xmath95 and @xmath96 has the smaller magnitude .    before presenting numerical results",
    ", it is helpful to consider what behavior to expect as the singularity is approached ( that is as @xmath97 ) . first denote the eigenvalues of @xmath98 by ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "then suppose that at sufficiently early times the time averages of @xmath100 are all positive .",
    "then the time averages of the eigenvalues of @xmath101 are all positive .",
    "since we are evolving in the negative time direction , this should lead ( through equation ( [ ev1 ] ) ) to an exponential decrease in @xmath102 .",
    "however , since all spatial derivatives appear in the equations in the form @xmath103 we would expect the spatial derivatives to become negligible .",
    "that is , the approach to the singularity is local . furthermore , this positivity of the time averages of the eigenvalues of @xmath101 should lead ( through equations ( [ ev2]-[ev3 ] ) ) to exponential decrease in @xmath69 and @xmath104 .",
    "a similar argument applied to equations ( [ ev6 ] ) and ( [ dtqvec ] ) and using equations ( [ cn2 ] ) and ( [ cn4 ] ) indicates that as the singularity is approached @xmath105 should become negligible , but @xmath74 should not , and therefore that @xmath106 should become negligible .",
    "thus , as the singularity is approached , the system should be well described by a simplified set of evolution and constraint equations where spatial derivatives as well as @xmath107 and @xmath106 are negligible .",
    "note that the fact that spatial derivatives are becoming negligible does @xmath108 mean that the spacetime is becoming homogeneous .",
    "rather the considerable spatial variation is becoming a negligible part of the equations of motion since all spatial derivatives appear multiplied by @xmath102 which is becoming negligible .",
    "we now write down this simplified system of evolution and constraint equations where all these terms are neglected . in this limit equation ( [ cn3 ] ) implies that the matricies @xmath98 and @xmath109 commute and therefore have the same eigenvalues .",
    "the evolution equations for @xmath110 and @xmath111 can then be written as evolution equations for their eigenvalues . the non - trivial evolution and",
    "constraint equations then become in this limit @xmath112 @xmath113 here @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the eigenvalues of @xmath98 and @xmath109 respectively and @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 and indicies are not summed over unless explicitly indicated .",
    "suppose that the dynamics is in a period ( called a kasner epoch ) when all the @xmath115 are negligibly small .",
    "then it follows from equations ( [ trcn1 ] ) and ( [ trcn2 ] ) that @xmath118 and therefore , from equations ( [ trev1 ] ) and ( [ trev3 ] ) that @xmath74 and the @xmath114 are constant . from equations ( [ trcn1 ] ) and ( [ trev2 ] ) it follows that there are two possibilities for a kasner epoch : ( i ) all the @xmath114 are @xmath119 in which case the @xmath115 remain negligible and the kasner epoch lasts all the way to the singularity .",
    "( ii ) one of the @xmath114 is @xmath120 in which case the corresponding @xmath115 grows until it is large enough to bring the kasner epoch to an end .",
    "we now look in more detail at possibility ( ii ) .",
    "let @xmath121 be the @xmath114 that is @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath123 is the @xmath115 that is growing .",
    "we are therefore led to examine equations ( [ trev1]-[trcn2 ] ) neglecting @xmath124 and @xmath125 but not @xmath123 .",
    "in this regime equations ( [ trev1 ] ) and ( [ trev2 ] ) become @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "define @xmath128 .",
    "then equation ( [ sig1ke ] ) becomes @xmath129 while from equations ( [ sig2ke ] ) and ( [ sig3ke ] ) it follows that there are constants @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 such that @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , it follows from equation ( [ omegake ] ) that there is a constant @xmath135 such that @xmath136 .",
    "finally , it then follows from equation ( [ trcn1 ] ) that @xmath137 satisfies the equation of motion @xmath138 z\\ ] ] where @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "note that the quantity in square brackets vanishes at @xmath140 and @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the dynamics is a `` bounce '' from a kasner epoch corresponding to @xmath141 to one corresponding to @xmath140 . use a minus subscript to denote a quantity before the bounce and a plus subscript to denote a quantity after the bounce .",
    "we then have @xmath143 .",
    "however , from the definition of @xmath137 it follows that @xmath144 while from the definition of @xmath145 it follows that @xmath146 .",
    "we then find the following `` bounce rule '' relating a quantity after the bounce to quantities before the bounce .",
    "@xmath147 note that from the bounce rule it follows that @xmath74 increases at each bounce .",
    "furthermore , it follows from equation ( [ trcn1 ] ) ( and from the fact that @xmath148 is trace - free ) that the minimum possible value for a @xmath114 during a kasner epoch is @xmath149 and therefore that no further bounces can happen once @xmath150 ( though bounces may cease at lower values of @xmath74 ) .",
    "thus we expect that at each spatial point there is a last bounce followed by a kasner epoch that lasts all the way to the singularity .",
    "in other words , we expect the approach to the singularity to be of the andersson and rendall class .",
    "all runs were done in double precision on a sunblade 2000 with @xmath151 ( except for a convergence test which also used @xmath152 ) .",
    "the equations were evolved from @xmath153 to @xmath154 . for the initial data ,",
    "the trace of the extrinsic curvature was @xmath155 corresponding to an initial value of @xmath156 for @xmath68 .",
    "the constants @xmath157 and @xmath65 characterizing the initial data were @xmath158 and the constant @xmath159 was @xmath160 .",
    "we would like to know whether @xmath161 and @xmath29 become negligible as the singularity is approached . in figure 1",
    "are plotted the maximum values ( over all space , @xmath162 and @xmath2 ) of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "note that after a certain amount of evolution , all these quantities steadily decrease .",
    "this indicates that after a certain amount of time spatial derivatives become negligible in the eqautions of motion and that the approximation considered at the end of the previous section becomes valid .",
    "maximum values of @xmath165 ( solid line ) , @xmath166 ( dotted line ) @xmath167 ( dot - dashed line ) and @xmath164 ( dashed line ) _ vs _",

    "we now present data of that form .",
    "the behavior at the spatial point chosen is typical .",
    "the results of a convergence test are plotted in figure 2 . here",
    "what is plotted is @xmath169 for the @xmath151 run ( solid line ) and @xmath174 for the @xmath152 run ( dotted line ) .",
    "both quantities are plotted _ vs _ @xmath170 .",
    "note that the two curves roughly agree in magnitude but become out of sync in time .",
    "this indicates second order convergence but with the system having sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "similar results were obtained for the other constraints .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show respectively the diagonal components of @xmath148 and @xmath71 in the asymptotic frame , _",
    "i.e. _ the frame of the eigenvectors that @xmath175 has at the end of the evolution . for that part of the evolution where the approximation made at the end of the previous section is valid , these diagonal components are the eigenvalues of @xmath176 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "note that the dynamics of the eigenvalues of @xmath176 consists of epochs where they are apporoximately constant ( kasner epochs ) punctuated by short bounces .",
    "furthermore the components of @xmath71 are negligible except at the bounces . also note that there is a last bounce and that this coincides with the most negative eigenvalue of @xmath98 becoming greater than @xmath155 .    in figure 5",
    "is plotted @xmath74 _ vs _ @xmath170 .",
    "note that the behavior of @xmath74 is a sequence of constant values that are punctuated by short bounces and that the bounces in @xmath74 occur at the same times as the bounces in @xmath148 .",
    "the sequence of the values of @xmath74 is 0.05956 , 0.1607 , 0.4139 , 0.6231 , while the corresponding values of the most negative eigenvalues of @xmath177 are -1.583 , -1.565 , -1.277 , -0.6596 .",
    "these values obey the `` bounce rule '' of equation ( [ rlbounce ] ) .",
    "these simulations support the expected picture for the approach to the generic singularity in a spacetime where the matter is a stiff fluid . as the singularity",
    "is approached the terms in the equations of motion involving spatial derivatives become negligible .",
    "the dynamics at each spatial point consists of a sequence of kasner epochs punctuated by short bounces .",
    "the sequence of values of @xmath74 obeys the expected bounce rule .",
    "there is a last bounce , after which the dynamics is described by a single kasner epoch all the way to the singularity , thus yielding a spacetime in the class of reference @xcite .",
    "what remains to be done is to treat the approach to the singularity for non - stiff fluids . here",
    "the behavior that is expected is quite different .",
