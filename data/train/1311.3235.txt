    "the spin polarization densities vanish in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) ring with only rashba soi due to kramers degeneracy for the time - reversal symmetric system ( see also ref .",
    "it is therefore clear that the spin polarization densities in the case without photon cavity result only from the geometric deviations from the 1d ring model , for example , the contact regions .",

    "the circularly polarized photon field has a non - vanishing spin angular momentum perturbing the angular orbital motion of the electrons .",
    "electrons in a 1d ring geometry ( as an approximation of our geometry ) do not show a circular charge current for vanishing magnetic field  @xcite , but placing them in a photon cavity with circularly polarized photon field would let them move around the ring due to the spin angular momentum of light .",
    "the circular motion is a much stronger perturbation of the ring electrons than the perturbation caused by the linearly polarized photon field .",

    "the relatively strong vortices in , which are located close to the contact regions to the leads , are usually not as symmetric in @xmath35-direction around their center than they are in @xmath37-direction .",
    "correspondingly , there is often a relatively strong net @xmath37-component of the canonical momentum leading to a rashba effective magnetic field in @xmath35-direction and a much stronger @xmath140 spin polarization than @xmath134 spin polarization .",
    "it is in particular interesting to observe the local antisymmetric behavior of the @xmath35- and @xmath153-component of the spin polarization around the level crossings at @xmath131 ( ( b ) ) , which are the spin polarizations induced by the circularly polarized photon field .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath134 spin polarization is clearly not antisymmetric around @xmath131 for the linearly polarized photon field ( see ) .",
    "it can be seen from a comparison of ( a ) , where @xmath154 , and ( b ) , where @xmath155 , that the circulation direction of the strong vortex at the left contact region is inversed .",
    "this leads to the local antisymmetric behavior of the @xmath140 and @xmath133 spin polarization around @xmath156 .",
    "since the pronounced vortex structure is mainly due to the circular polarization of the photon field , only the components of the spin polarization , which are induced by the circularly polarized cavity photon field show the local antisymmetric behavior .",
    "the fact that the @xmath134 spin polarization is not antisymmetric for linear photon field polarization can be understood as follows : qualitatively , as said before , only the canonical momentum due to the deviations from the 1d ring geometry ( and the photon cavity , which is unimportant for @xmath134 in the case of circular photon field polarization ) allows for spin polarization in the central system .",
    "the contact regions in @xmath35-direction cause only smaller perturbations of the central system spectrum beyond the level - crossing structure from the 1d ring geometry ( which only the circularly polarized photon field can perturb ) .",
    "it is not likely that these smaller perturbations would lead to additional level - crossings around @xmath157  mevnm , which we have found to be responsible for the antisymmetric behavior of @xmath140 and @xmath133 for circular polarization .",
    "therefore , a local antisymmetry of @xmath134 around @xmath158  mevnm can not be found .",
    "the @xmath35- and @xmath153-components of the spin polarization are also antisymmetric with respect to the handedness of the circularly polarized light ( ( a ) in comparison with ( b ) ) .",
    "as the @xmath140 and @xmath133 spin polarization are a direct and pure consequence of circular polarization meaning that they are vanishing in the case without photon cavity and in the case with linear polarized photon field , it is understandable that a sign change in the handedness would follow a sign change in the effective magnetic field and spin polarization .",
    "in fact , also the vortex circulation direction is inversed by an inversion of the handedness of the circularly polarized photon field .",
    "the situation is different for the @xmath134 spin polarization , which is different from zero in the absence of photons .",
    "the circularly polarized photon field changes the @xmath134 spin polarization only slightly .",
    "furthermore , comparing the rashba and dresselhaus case for rh circularly polarized photon field ( ( b ) and ( c ) ) , we can verify the spin polarization symmetries @xmath159 due to the structure of the rashba and dresselhaus hamiltonian .",
    "here , we show our numerical results for the charge and spin polarization currents , both between the leads and the system and in the system ( quantum ring ) itself . emphasis is laid on the phenomena caused by the photon cavity with a focus on the circularly polarized photon field .",

    "we note in passing that the result depends not on the handedness of the circularly polarized light .",
    "left- or right - handedness would only interchange the meaning of the otherwise indifferent upper and lower ring arm .",
    "with increasing initial number of photons the current tends to get suppressed due to the in general smaller energy differences between the mb levels and the fact that the states having a larger photon content lie in general higher in energy .",
    "however , more interestingly , we observe two additional current dips for smaller and larger @xmath22 , while the current dip at @xmath131 appears weaker . with increasing number of initial photons , the two dips for smaller or larger rashba coefficient move to even smaller ( @xmath160  mevnm ) or larger ( @xmath161  mevnm ) rashba coefficients , respectively , as the initial photon number increases ( @xmath162 ) .",

    "the interaction between spin - orbit coupled electrons in a quantum ring interferometer and a circularly polarized electromagnetic field shows a variety of interesting effects , which do not appear for linear polarization of the photon field .",
    "the ac phase that controls the transport of electrons in such a quantum device is influenced by the photons .",
    "we found that the spin polarization in a ring , which is connected to leads and mirror symmetric with respect to the transport axis , is perpendicular to the transport direction .",
    "a linearly polarized photon field with polarization in or perpendicular to the transport direction , increases only the magnitude of the spin polarization while keeping the direction of the spin polarization vector uninfluenced .",
    "the spin polarization accumulates to larger magnitudes when the transport of electrons is suppressed by a destructive ac phase .",
    "the circularly polarized photon field enhances the spin polarization much more than the linearly polarized photon field .",
    "furthermore , the spin polarization vector is no longer bound to a specific direction as the circularly polarized photon field excites the orbital angular motion of the electrons around the ring and pronounced vortices of the charge current density of smaller spatial scale .",
    "the latter show the importance to resolve the finite width of our ring as we did in our model .",
    "the circulation direction of the vortices is found to depend on the handedness of the photon field and the value of the rashba coefficient @xmath22 relative to @xmath198 .",
    "the charge current from the left lead into the quantum ring device and out to the right lead shows three ac dips around @xmath198 instead of one for the circularly polarized photon field .",
    "the reason for it is a small splitting of degenerate states by the interaction of the angular momentum of the electrons and the spin angular momentum of light , which leads to mb crossings at three different values of the rashba coefficient .",
    "the distance in @xmath22 between the dips increases with the number of photons in the system due to the larger spin angular momentum of light .",
    "the charge photocurrent from the left to the right side of the quantum ring is usually negative meaning that the photon cavity suppresses the charge transport thus increasing the device resistance ( except close to @xmath198 , where the ac phase interference is destructive ) .",
    "the circulating part of the charge photocurrent can only be excited by the circularly polarized photon field .",
    "the handedness of the circulation depends on the handedness of the light . this way , it is possible to confine the charge transport through the ring to one ring arm ( upper or lower ) .",
    "the circular charge photocurrent is suppressed in a wide range of the rashba coefficient around @xmath131 and might therefore serve as a reliable quantity to detect destructive ac phases .",
    "the spin photocurrents are especially strong around @xmath131 ( due to the longer electron dwell time ) and for circular polarization ( for geometrical reasons ) .",
    "the handedness of the light does not influence the spin polarization current including the current for @xmath133 spin polarization , which circulates around the ring .    in summary , strong spin polarization , spin photocurrents and",
    "charge current vortices as well as splitting of the ac charge current dip into three dips and control over the local charge flow through the ring arms are important effects that only appear for circularly polarized photon field .",
    "these effects are crucial to know about for the development of spin - optoelectronic quantum devices in the field of quantum information processing . for instance",
    ", interest might arise to build a spintronic device , which breaks ( blocks ) an electrical circuit if the gate voltage is not precisely equal to a specific , sharply defined critical value , which corresponds to the magnitude of the electric field leading to a destructive ac phase interference in a ring interferometer .",
    "the critical gate potential of the quantum switch could be adjusted by variation of the ring radius  @xcite . a possible experimental approach to determine",
    "the ring radius would be to measure the circular charge current around the ring ( for example indirectly by its induced magnetic field ) that is caused by a circularly polarized cavity photon field .",
    "we predict that this approach is better than direct resistance measurements of the quantum switch without the photon cavity .",
    "this is because the data that a certain number of measurements with the circularly polarized cavity photon field yields are more relevant for suggesting the proper ring radius due to the broadness of the corresponding aharonov - casher feature in the rashba coefficient .",

    "the range of @xmath22 investigated in this paper is about one order of magnitude larger than typical values of @xmath22 for gaas .",
    "however , we point out that the predicted features are at fixed positions in @xmath170 ( ) and not in @xmath22 . therefore , by increasing the ring radius , experiments could be performed in a smaller range of the rashba coefficient if it seems difficult to increase the electric field sufficiently by a gate . for our numerical calculations , it is inconvenient to increase the ring radius further , as we would have to consider a larger number of many - body states to get converged results . with the state of the art computational facilities , however , we are limited to about @xmath224 many - body states for our numerically exact approach . alternatively , other materials as inas could be used , for which the the rashba coefficient is about one order of magnitude larger  @xcite . the dresselhaus coefficient @xmath24 is determined by the bulk properties of the material and could only be changed by using a different material .",

    "<S> we explore the influence of a circularly polarized cavity photon field on the transport properties of a finite - width ring , in which the electrons are subject to spin - orbit and coulomb interaction . the quantum ring is embedded in an electromagnetic cavity and described by `` exact '' numerical diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> we study the case that the cavity photon field is circularly polarized and compare it to the linearly polarized case . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum device is moreover coupled to external , electrically biased leads . </S>",
    "<S> the time propagation in the transient regime is described by a non - markovian generalized master equation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spin polarization and spin photocurrents of the quantum ring are largest for circularly polarized photon field and destructive aharonov - casher ( ac ) phase interference . </S>",
    "<S> the charge current suppression dip due to the destructive ac phase becomes threefold under the circularly polarized photon field as the interaction of the electrons angular momentum and spin angular momentum of light causes many - body level splitting leading to three many - body level crossing locations instead of one . </S>",
    "<S> the circular charge current inside the ring , which is induced by the circularly polarized photon field , is found to be suppressed in a much wider range around the destructive ac phase than the lead - device - lead charge current . </S>",
    "<S> the charge current can be directed through one of the two ring arms with the help of the circularly polarized photon field , but is superimposed by vortices of smaller scale . unlike the charge photocurrent , the flow direction of the spin photocurrent is found to be independent of the handedness of the circularly polarized photon field .    </S>",
