    "supersymmetry is one of the most attractive models beyond the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics .",
    "the superpartners of sm particles ( sparticles ) might have masses of the order of the tev , and experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) should be able to detect such particles up to masses of 2 - 3 tev @xcite .",
    "the pattern of the sparticle mass spectrum depends on the susy - breaking mechanism , which might depend on gravity , space - time structure , or unknown interactions .",
    "the unraveling of such mechanism through the determination of the sparticles masses is therefore one of the most important physics targets of future collider experiments .",
    "the potential of the lhc for susy mass determination has been studied in detail in the past decade .",
    "the most promising method involves the study of the endpoints in the distributions of invariant masses among the visible sparticle decay products .",
    "information on the masses involved in the cascade decay can be extracted from the endpoint values if the decay distributions are dominated by a single cascade decay chain .",
    "studies based on the endpoints are documented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore a new method for reconstructing susy events .",
    "this method does not rely only on events near the endpoint .",
    "instead , one kinematically solves the neutralino momenta and masses of heavier sparticles using measured jet and lepton momenta and optionally a few mass inputs .",
    "we concentrate in this paper on the measurement of the mass of the bottom squarks ( sbottoms ) through the cascade decay : @xmath2 we address this decay , rather than the equivalent cascade involving a generic @xmath3 for various orders of reasons .",
    "first of all , the physics of the third generation squarks and leptons is particularly important in disentangling the pattern of susy breaking . in the msugra model , @xmath4 is lighter than @xmath5 due to the rge running by top yukawa coupling .",
    "the mass of the lighter sbottom state @xmath6 is further reduced by the mixing of the left and right @xmath7 states .",
    "the sbottom sector is thus sensitive to fundamental parameters of the theory such as the trilinear couplings and @xmath8 otherwise of difficult access at the lhc .",
    "the third generation sparticle masses are also important parameters for @xmath9 and higgs physics .",
    "second , the chain in eq .",
    "( [ bbll ] ) involves two @xmath1 quarks , which can be tagged in the detector .",
    "the problem of correctly identifying the jets contributing to the interesting decay is thus made much simpler .",
    "finally , as we will discuss in detail below , both sbottom states @xmath10 and @xmath11 yield the decay chain of eq .",
    "( [ bbll ] ) .",
    "the performance and the robustness of the reconstruction algorithms can be benchmarked against the ability in disentangling the two states .",
    "five sparticles are involved in the cascade decay eq .",
    "( [ bbll ] ) , therefore one can write five mass shell conditions among the leptons and quarks in the final decay products",
    ". @xmath12    for a @xmath13 event , the equations contain the 4 unknown degrees of freedom of the @xmath14 momentum .",
    "each event therefore describes a 4-dimensional hyper - surface in a 5-dimensional mass parameter space , and the hyper - surface differs event by event . from the purely mathematical point of view 5 events",
    "would be enough to determine a discrete set of solutions for the masses of the involved sparticles , and the probabilistic discussion of the following could be easily developed in a 5-dimensional space . in order to illustrate the method in a more transparent way , we will develop the argument by assuming that the masses of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath14 are known .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption at the lhc , where it has been shown that a detailed study of the lepton - lepton system from the @xmath15 decay can be used to precisely constrain these masses @xcite . in this case",
    ", each event corresponds to a different line in the @xmath17 plane , therefore two events are enough to solve the gluino and sbottom masses altogether .",
    "we call this technique the `` mass relation method '' , because here one uses the fact that sparticle masses are common for all events which go though the same cascade decay chain .",
    "note that the events need not to be close to the endpoint of the decay distribution , but they are still relevant to the mass determination .",
    "this means that one can use the mass relation method even if the number of signal events is small .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore in detail the implications of the mass relation method which is only sketched for signal events in @xcite . in that report a measurement of the gluino and sbottom masses",
    "was obtained from the peak of the distribution of the solutions for all possible event pairs , assuming that the @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 masses are known . in this paper",
    "we extend the previous analysis to take susy backgrounds into account in the distributions .",
    "we note that @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ bbll ] ) could be either @xmath6 or @xmath20 .",
    "the decay was studied in @xcite by using the endpoint method , where the possibility of distinguishing the two sbottom states @xmath6 and @xmath20 was studied for a case where the mass difference was approximately 5% of the sbottom mass .",
    "the conclusion showed that even with very large integrated luminosity the result is at best marginal , and crucially depends on the ability of the experimenters to model to a very high level of detail the response function of the detector to @xmath1-jets .",
    "this is probably an inescapable conclusion , given that the resolution in calorimetric measurement is comparable to the mass splitting one wants to measure .",
    "it is however worth studying alternative reconstruction methods which make a better use of all the information available for the selected events .    in a subsequent paper @xcite ,",
    "a similar process is analyzed by constructing an approximate event - likelihood function for signal events , based on a bayesian statistical approach . in this paper",
    "we construct a different approximation for the likelihood function .",
    "we apply this function to the analysis of a simulated data set , and we study how well @xmath6 and @xmath20 can be reconstructed for a sample model point and its variants .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we introduce the detailed susy models addressed in our study , and briefly present the simulation procedure .",
    "we then solve in section [ sec3 ] analytically the kinematics for the process eq .",
    "( [ bbll ] ) , arriving to a compact expression for the masses of @xmath21 and @xmath7 as the function of @xmath1 and @xmath22 momentum and discuss the typical solutions . in section [ sec4 ] , we discuss the event pair analysis on our sample susy model , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are computed from all event pairings in the selected samples .",
    "gluino and sbottom masses consistent with the input values are reconstructed , but we are also forced to artificially select one of the multiple solutions obtained from solving for the masses the coupled quadratic equations for each event pair . in section [ sec5 ] , we therefore define an approximate likelihood function built using all the events in the sample , and we describe an analysis based on this function .",
    "the masses reconstructed from the likelihood analysis are in agreement with the input values and the method automatically takes care of the issue of multiple solutions without artificial selection .",
    "we also study the possibility to reconstruct the @xmath20 in our sample model .",
    "section [ sec6 ] is devoted to discussions and comments .",
    "we especially discuss the theoretical relevance of being able to perform detailed measurements in the third generation squark sector .",
    "we choose for this study the model point sps1a as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and its variants .",
    "sps1a has a significant production cross - section for the chain of eq .",
    "( [ bbll ] ) , and has already been the subject of detailed lhc studies @xcite .",
    "the model is defined in the msugra scenario by the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26  gev , @xmath27  gev , @xmath28  gev , and @xmath29 . in order to evaluate the performance of the analysis for different values of the splitting of the two sbottom states",
    ", we also study the points where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , keeping other gut scale parameters same as those for sps1a .",
    "for the additional points , the @xmath32 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath16 masses are almost the same as for sps1a , while @xmath33 is reduced because the left right mixing of @xmath7 increases proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "the masses and decay branching ratios are calculated with the isasusy code @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 changes by 3% from @xmath25 to @xmath36 .",
    "we will see later that such a difference in the @xmath6 masses should be measurable at the lhc if systematic effects are kept under control .",
    "another drastic effect in table  [ table2 ] is the decrease of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is because the decay width for @xmath39 increases as the @xmath40 mixing angle increases . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the branching ratio into @xmath13 mode is reduced by a factor of 5 yielding a rather small number of accepted events .",
    "we also list in table  [ table2 ] the decay branching ratios relevant to the decay chain of our interest .",
    "the ratio of the decay branching ratios @xmath41@xmath42 varies from 0.26 to 0.14 when @xmath8 changes from 10 to 20 .",
    "this @xmath8 dependence comes from the reduction of @xmath6 mass and the increase of the left - right mixing of @xmath7 , @xmath43 , defined as @xmath44 , from @xmath45 ( @xmath25 ) to 0.61 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "namely ,    * @xmath46 increases as @xmath35 is reduced .",
    "* @xmath47 increases as @xmath43 increases .",
    "however , @xmath48 and @xmath49 also increase , therefore @xmath50 stays more or less same .",
    "* @xmath35 is reduced and @xmath51 is kinematically suppressed as @xmath8 increases .",
    "the branching ratio is in principle important information to determine the mixing angle @xmath43 but one needs to know the relevant sparticle mass spectrum to utilize it .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath52 is small and the mass splitting between @xmath6 and @xmath20 is within 10% over the parameters we study .",
    "the @xmath6 is therefore significant background for the @xmath20 search at the lhc .",
    "nevertheless , a hint for the decay of @xmath53 might still be observable in the @xmath13 distribution , given an excellent control of the detector response to @xmath1-jets , as we will see in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "the susy events are generated using the herwig 6.4 @xcite event generator .",
    "the produced events are passed through the atlfast @xcite detector simulator , which parameterizes the response of the atlas detector .",
    "in particular , we use the parametrization for @xmath1-tagging efficiency corresponding to the expected high luminosity performance of the atlas detector .",
    "while the performance is a function of the @xmath0 of the jets , a typical performance figure is @xmath54 for the @xmath1 tagging efficiency for a rejection of 100 on light quark jets .",
    "for each point we have generated @xmath55 events which approximately correspond to an integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath56 .",
    "the following cuts are applied in order to select signal events :    * @xmath57  gev and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the missing transverse energy and @xmath60 is the scalar sum of the missing transverse energy and the transverse momenta of the four hardest jets , * at least 3 jets with @xmath61  gev , @xmath62  gev and @xmath63  gev , * exactly two @xmath1-tagged jets with @xmath64  gev , * exactly two opposite - sign isolated same - flavor ( ossf ) leptons with @xmath65  gev , @xmath66  gev , with an invariant mass @xmath67  gev@xmath68  gev .",
    "the isolation criterion consists in requiring a transverse energy deposition in the calorimeters smaller than @xmath69  gev in a ( @xmath70 ) cone of radius @xmath71 around the lepton direction , where @xmath72 is the pseudorapidity of the lepton and @xmath73 the angle in the plane transverse to the beam . a detailed discussion of the standard model backgrounds after these cuts is given in @xcite .",
    "the authors show that the standard model background is negligible in comparison to the susy background , consisting of susy events not including the decay chain of eq .",
    "( [ bbll ] ) .    in order to perform the reconstruction , we need to identify the position of each of the two @xmath1-jets and of each of the two leptons in the decay chain . in the following analysis",
