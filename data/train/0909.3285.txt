    "dispersion interactions between macroscopic bodies have been the subject of investigation for a long time , and a variety of experiments have been performed to test the theoretical predictions . whilst the theory of casimir forces  @xcite between bodies in free space is well defined , the issue of choosing the correct stress tensor for bodies immersed in dielectric backgrounds is not a closed discussion  @xcite .",
    "depending on what type of compatibility is required with the microscopic degrees of freedom , one is led to different choices .",
    "the classic example of the minkowski vs. canonical stress tensor ( formally the same as the stress tensor in microscopic electrodynamics ) , or the choice for the momentum density vs. poynting vector describing momentum density propagation in a dispersive media show the different possibilities on offer .",
    "the canonical stress tensor is the choice compatible with the lorentz force law  @xcite that describe the microscopic degrees of freedom . with this choice",
    ", the formalism of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics  @xcite can be used to evaluate the two point correlation functions . in this description one",
    "is able to maintain the equal time commutation relations for the physical fields and thus employ a sensible quantum theory of light interacting linearly and causally with matter . in the same fashion ,",
    "many calculations are successfully carried out in the well established lifshitz framework  @xcite .",
    "it is also not surprising that there should be a large overlap with colloid physics and the corresponding dispersion forces ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "given that casimir force experiments can now be performed with bodies immersed in dielectric media  @xcite , it is an important objective to develop the predictions based on the canonical stress tensor for future experimental matching . with this testing in mind",
    ", we may start to think of new physical probes e.g. many body interactions  @xcite and critical casimir effects  @xcite as a way of better understanding and testing the underlying processes .",
    "this combined effort is necessary in establishing any scheme for the choice of the relevant physical observables .",
    "the necessity of a detailed understanding of the above issues is clearly of particular relevance to nano - scale architectures , where a precise knowledge of these forces ( stiction forces ) between nano - mechanical objects is important . at such small length scales where bodies are attracting / repelling due to these interactions",
    ", one will encounter new frictional forces or many body effects .",
    "atom chip miniaturisation  @xcite is a good example where one would need a quantitative description .",
    "we also see the point here that a detailed understanding of both different geometries and many body effects will be required .",
    "clearly the practical need is to better understand the nature of the interactions between macroscopic bodies .",
    "as recently pointed out in  @xcite one needs to go beyond the simple proximity force approximation ( pfa ) and correctly include volume ( bulk ) contributions to the casimir force ( see also  @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "to this end , casimir energies have been calculated recently  @xcite between arbitrary compact bodies .",
    "their approach was to evaluate a suitable energy functional by the use of path integral determinants and to make expansions , having evaluated a t - operator ( see also  @xcite for similar early work ) . by deducing an interaction potential , a force could then be derived by simple differentiation ( for an overview , see e.g. ref .",
    "related work on both calculational and matters of principle can be found in  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we evaluate the casimir force for a collection of dielectric spheres in a dielectric media using the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics as applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the planar geometry .",
    "we use the canonical stress tensor to calculate the resultant force on one of the spheres in the configuration .",
    "a brief comment will be made on how they qualitatively differ from those that arise from the minkowski stress tensor , though a detailed comparison of quantitative differences will be left to the future ( when the appropriate experiments have the necessary sensitivity ) .",
    "the permittivities are considered to be frequency dependent and complex in general .",
    "the examples chosen to illustrate the inter - sphere forces will be evaluated in the retarded limit whereby we will use their constant static values .",
    "the calculations are carried out in a similar fashion to the casimir energies cited above , by performing perturbative expansions of scattering two - point functions in terms of the relevant reflection / scattering coefficients . that these are the relevant perturbation parameters follows directly from energy conservation ( i.e. the dielectric spheres are not amplifying bodies ) and that they are effectively the energy dependent coupling constants of the theory .",
    "generally speaking , one needs to find an approximate geometry for which the helmholtz equation can be solved ( i.e. we perform the separation of variables in local coordinate patches and glue them together ) .",
    "then the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues can be used to evaluate the scattering correlation functions in one of two ways .",
    "one is to use a lippmann - schwinger evaluation of the green s function based on the known background hamiltonian where the dielectric spheres are perturbation potentials on top of this .",
    "the second route which is the one followed here is to apply the boundary conditions at all the interfaces and then deduce the ` out ' states ( the scattered modes together with their outgoing wavefunctions ) from the ` in ' states ( the incident driving modes and their incoming wavefunctions ) .",
    "the driving modes , which are the coefficients of the eigenfunction expansion of the electric and magnetic fields ( the precise form will be given later on ) , must be evaluated and indeed these are deduced from the background when no spheres are present .",
    "in fact , although one usually talks about the separation of the spheres , it is the total path length that is the meaningful distance when talking about the @xmath0-body force .",
    "a further simplification is possible for a set of terms in the multiple scattering expansion where the number of spheres becomes large , whilst the coupling constants become small .",
    "for some fixed separation of the spheres we can deduce an alternative functional form of the force .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section - force ] we evaluate the scattering two - point functions for the given setup of @xmath0 distinct spheres as a perturbative series in the mie scattering coefficients .",
    "this allows us to write the casimir force as a multiple scattering expansion . in sections  [ sec:2sphereforce ] and  [ sec:3sphereforce ]",
    "we consider the two - sphere and three sphere configurations both at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the evaluation performed here is for the retarded limit where we take the static values of the permittivities , as a definite way in which to evaluate frequency integral . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nsphere ] we calculate the @xmath0-body force in the limit of a large number of spheres and at weak coupling . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we set out our conclusions .",
    "it is worth remarking on some aspects of the geometry for the simple two sphere system before considering the general @xmath0-sphere system .",
    "one would expect the force on one of the two spheres ( with separation @xmath1 ) can be evaluated in three distinct perturbative regions i.e. particular distinct separations . in each region",
    "the force will have some scaling law:-    1 .",
    "region 1 , where the separation of the spheres is much greater than the sphere radii . here",
    "an asymptotic multipole expansion is relevant .",
    "the polarizabilities act as the perturbation theory coupling constants .",
    "the leading term for the force goes as @xmath2 and the effective geometry is three dimensional .",
    "2 .   region 2 , where the separation of the sphere surfaces is small compared to the radii .",
    "the leading term for the force per unit area goes as @xmath3 for small parallel elements of area .",
    "the effective geometry becomes planar ( one dimensional )",
    ". this would be the basis for the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) where curvature corrections are then taken into account at close separations .",
    "the force then goes as @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   region 3 , where the separation is comparable to the radii . here one might think that there exists a third perturbative point ( effective geometry ) that is somewhere between the forms of regions one and two .",
    "the leading term for the force per unit length may be expected to go as @xmath5 with the corresponding two dimensional effective geometry .",
    "the effective geometry mentioned above is just the space in which the bodies can be moved and that parametrize the interaction .",
    "for example the parallel plate geometry has just the one dimension in which they can be moved . by interpolating the known perturbative solutions in regions 1 and 2 one can find an approximate solution that can be used over all distances .",
    "however , this method also requires the use of two different cutoff separations , where in the lower limit we would encounter an infinity and an upper cutoff to say what we mean by a large separation .",
    "is is also difficult to glue these asymptotic solutions together in the intermediate region because we need to convert the small separation pressure into a force .",
    "it is not obvious what area integration to use here and signals the trouble of using the pfa in high curvature compact geometries .",
    "the general strategy in calculating the casimir force on a particular body is simply to calculate the scattering 2-point correlation functions for the physical fields , in our case the electric and magnetic fields . given @xmath0-spheres we are going to calculate the force on sphere 1 due to the presence of the remaining @xmath6 spheres .",
    "the helmholtz equation for the electric and magnetic fields is solved in @xmath0 separate coordinate systems centred on each sphere in terms of vector wave functions about each of the separate spherical coordinate systems origin  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the pictorial setup of our system is given in figure  [ fig : nspheres ] .    , \\cdots , r[n]$ ] each centred on n separate coordinate systems @xmath7 , all contained in a background dielectric.,height=226 ]    using the results in  @xcite ,",
    "one is able to map solutions about any given sphere ( any coordinate system @xmath8 ) into a solution about any other translated origin ( a coordinate system @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is this fact that will enable us to perform the integral over the volume of the sphere .    the casimir force on sphere-1 ( with volume @xmath10 , the ball which has the two - dimensional sphere as its boundary ) due to the effects of the n - sphere system of differing material properties is given by @xmath11 the stress - energy tensor is given by the standard vacuum expression ( which is consistent with the lorentz force law  @xcite ) @xmath12 and it is understood that we are taking the limit for the initial and final points @xmath13 in performing this limit it is first necessary to make subtractions of the singular part arising from the free green s tensor .",
    "this is somewhat like a vacuum bubble one encounters in quantum field theory where we are throwing away an unobservable zero point energy .",
    "we then need to evaluate the scattering correlation functions ( whilst dropping the direct modes of propagation ) , viz . @xmath14 and similarly for magnetic fields .",
    "a crucial second step is to realise that the volume integral of the force requires a careful specification of the coordinate origin in order to be able to evaluate the derivative . in the multiple scattering approach",
    "used here the coordinate origin used will be the one centred on the sphere from which the last scattering event took place , then translated to the origin of the sphere where we are calculating the force . in terms of the classical scattering green s tensor @xmath15",
    "centred on the sphere where we are calculating the force , schematically we have    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the vector connecting the centre of the two spheres , originating from the last scattering sphere centre and @xmath18 is the element of solid angle . it should be pointed out here that this approximation , in order to be consistent with the case of a sphere and a dipole , requires the introduction of a normalisation factor ( for us it will be @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is because the derivative acting on the stress tensor is evaluated at the centre of the sphere , whilst the wavefunctions are evaluated on the spheres surface . in the case of the sphere and dipole , we do not have the integral to do over the @xmath20 . due to the potentially singular nature when shrinking the sphere down to a point , this clearly must be done carefully .    to construct the scattering two point function we write the fields in a mode decomposition  @xcite of spherical vector wave functions @xmath21 (",
    "note that the mode operator coefficients are functions of frequency which for now has been suppressed ) .",
    "the ` in ' and ` internal ' states are regular at the @xmath22-sphere origin , whilst the ` out ' states are outgoing modes falling off at infinity .",
    "they are eigenfunction modes with respect to the @xmath22-sphere of the radial eigenfunctions , represented by spherical bessel and hankel functions respectively .",
    "the internal coefficients @xmath23 of a given sphere can be eliminated by application of the continuity equations across each sphere .",
    "one is then able to determine the scattering coefficients @xmath24 in terms of the driving modes @xmath25 by making use of a translation addition theorem for vector wave functions  @xcite .",
    "these are given by    @xmath26 here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are representations of the translation group in the angular momentum basis .",
    "they can be found in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , together with the other necessary quantities used here , but in particular they are functions only of the centre - to - centre sphere separation @xmath29 $ ] and the background @xmath30 .",
    "the matrices @xmath27 map te - to - te and tm - to - tm , whilst the matrices @xmath28 map te - to - tm and vice versa . using the mie scattering coefficients @xmath31",
    "the scattering modes are given by ( where we suppress indices ) @xmath32 where the t - matrix has the block diagonal form @xmath33 the matrix equation given in  ( [ eq : tmatrix ] ) can be inverted and then perturbatively expanded as a power series in the mie scattering coefficients ( which play the role of the small coupling constants ) such that the scattered modes are found to be @xmath34 the t - matrix is then the set of reflection coefficients from each sphere appropriately translated and the integer @xmath35 gives the number of scattering events for the whole set of spheres .",
    "this is the multiple scattering approach ( see for example  @xcite ) which allows for all possible scattering between the spheres .    in order to calculate the @xmath0-body casimir force",
    "it is necessary to consider all possible ways of connecting all of the spheres .",
    "we can form a primitive set of diagrams that can be built on to generate all other diagrams .",
    "a suitable set of definitions are:-    * disconnected diagrams are where some subset of the spheres do not take part in the multiple @xmath0-body scattering process . *",
    "simply - connected diagrams are where all the spheres are connected with no more than two lines attached to any sphere .",
    "this forms a continuous path through all the spheres . *",
    "reducible diagrams are where diagrams can be written as simply connected diagram convoluted with a lower body diagram . this affords a description of multiple internal scattering .",
    "the simply - connected diagrams can be seen to be irreducible @xmath0-body diagrams .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will always be calculating the simply - connected diagrams and corresponds to one particular perturbation series ( as opposed to a perturbation series based on the sphere radii ) .",
    "we now specialise to the case of dielectric backgrounds and consider an approximation where @xmath36 so that the @xmath37 modes vanish .",
    "this approximation is based on the eventual small argument expansion of the mie scattering coefficients ( and thereby a simple multipole expansion ) where the @xmath38 scattering coefficient gives the leading contribution in the frequency integral .",
    "what is interesting in this case is that there are only contributions from the cross terms involving the @xmath39 and @xmath40 modes , as the @xmath41 and @xmath39 cross terms are zero due to the antisymmetry properties of the translation products @xmath42 . from equation  ( [ eq;scatmodes ] )",
    "it is possible to evaluate the 2-point functions in terms of the driving modes on the surface of sphere-1 .",

    "we have pointed out the need for non - collinearity , but that it is perturbatively not necessary .",
    "the total closed path length being always greater than the respective length scales of the associated radii helps in quantifying a perturbative evaluation , for example the frequencies ( found from the radii and total path length ) below which the mie scattering coefficients can be expanded .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the propagator connecting all scattering centres in this simple setup contains an exponential factor of the total path length .",
    "additionally it addresses the technical problem of going beyond the proximity force approximation ( pfa )  @xcite since , although continuity equations are applied at each material surface , there exists a solution of the field equations in each material medium . in general",
    "there will be both surface modes and bulk excitations in the bodies and calculations of casimir forces should contain both  @xcite .",
    "the multipole expansions found when the mie scattering coefficients are expanded are also not singular when the spheres touch , since the sum of the two radii act as a physical lower cutoff ( non - overlapping potentials ) .    for large @xmath0 and weakly scattering spheres , we have deduced a scaling type formula for the simply - connected force terms based on a fixed separation set of properties for the configuration .",
    "this could be useful for forces where we want to understand the behaviour as a function of @xmath0 rather than the detailed configuration ( separations and orientations ) .",
    "it can also serve to quantify the errors in a multiple scattering expansion when truncating the series at this order .",
    "in a subsequent paper one of us will develop the idea of the total path length playing a key role in casimir interactions .",
    "theoretically and experimentally there are many open issues that need to be addressed in conjunction and naturally follow on .",
    "it is clear that substantial progress has been made both theoretically and experimentally in refining the accuracy of casimir force calculations and measurements  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the theoretical calculations are for idealised geometries that do not necessarily reflect the experimental reality .",
    "one is faced with a potential disparity between the geometry encountered in the experiment , and those computable theoretically .",
    "we may for instance start off with a body that is very spherical , but that when we process it ( heating , gluing , or coating ) the sphericity of it will be reduced .",
    "for instance in  @xcite the initial borosilicate spheres are extremely smooth ( roughness @xmath111 ) but that the process of heating can induce surface roughness . and even if we calculate scattering coefficients for a given surface roughness profile , this is not necessarily what will be found experimentally .",
    "the problem requires both theoretical and experimental studies that are developed together .",
    "it is clear that we must perform a matching of experimental data ( classical scattering data from the body ) with calculations that allow for these unknown to be measured parameters ( for example non - spherical surfaces ) . only with this interplay",
    "can one be confident that the real bodies are being quantitatively described and to what extent perfect geometries are a good approximation .",
    "it could be labelled under the realistic geometries motif . for bodies in dispersive media ,",
    "more needs to be understood on different material choices together with improvements experimentally , to be able to resolve the detailed difference between different proposals for physical observables .",
    "j.  b. wishes to thank stefan buhmann , alex crosse , and rachele fermani for numerous helpful and constructive discussions whilst at imperial college london , and john gracey for helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported by the scala programme of the european commission and the uk engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) .",
    "the bulk green s tensor is defined by @xmath112 which can be rewritten as @xmath113 this can be functionally differentiated with respect to @xmath114 @xmath115 a complete set of states can now be inserted and together with taking the imaginary part we find @xmath116 at this point further simplification is possible when a known green s tensor is available together with the corresponding dispersion relation .",
    "substituting the scattering coefficients and the driving mode vacuum expectation values into the field correlation functions one finds the perturbative force on sphere 1 due to multiple scattering is , @xmath117=&-(-1)^n\\frac{\\hbar } { 4\\pi } r[1 ]   \\im \\int_{0}^{\\infty}d\\omega k \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times \\langle\\mathbf{1}| [ \\alpha^{1}(\\omega r[1 ] ) \\sum_{i=2}^{n}a^{1,i}(\\mathbf{r}[1,i ] ) \\cdot \\alpha^{i } ( \\omega r[i ] ) \\cdots \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cdots \\sum_{j=2}^{n}a^{i , j}(\\mathbf{r}[i , j ] ) \\cdot \\alpha^{j } \\sum^n_{j=2}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}[j,1 ] } a^{j,1}(\\mathbf{r}[j,1 ] ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times j(kr[1 ] ) h^{+}(kr[1])w(\\omega r[1 ] ) |\\mathbf{1}\\rangle , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( here the background permittivity is @xmath118 ) @xmath119)=l(l+1)\\left(l(l+1)-\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\epsilon_b ) \\omega^2r[1]^2\\right).\\ ] ] here we have omitted the @xmath43 indices as in the earlier text , but for the measure @xmath71 above , have stated how it depends on the labels .",
    "this encapsulates all contributions of the force as an order @xmath0 polynomial in the scattering coefficients .",
