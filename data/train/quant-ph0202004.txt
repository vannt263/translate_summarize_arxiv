    "quantum states are the carrier of quantum information . preparing , controlling , accessing and transmitting quantum states constitute the important part of quantum information theory .",
    "however , the non - clone theorem@xcite of an unknown quantum state holds back the effective utilization of quantum information .",
    "one of the striking discoveries in this area is quantum teleportation@xcite , which transmits an unknown quantum state from the sender ( alice ) to the receiver ( bob ) by a maximally entangled channel ( ebit ) and two classical bit ( cbit ) communication , namely 1 ebit+2 cbit teleports 1 qubit .",
    "recently , some interesting works for remote state preparation ( rsp ) @xcite , similar to teleportation , have been theoretically proposed by lo@xcite , pati@xcite and bennett et al.@xcite , which can remotely prepare a quantum state from alice to bob with less classical bit communication than teleportation . in their papers",
    ", they showed that for a special ensemble of states ( e.g. , qubit states chosen from the equator or the polar of the bloch sphere ) rsp  requires only one bit of classical communication per qubit , exactly half that of teleportation , i.e. , 1 ebit + 1 cbit transmits 1 qubit .",
    "but hitherto , though quantum teleportation has been implemented experimentally@xcite , rsp has not been experimentally tested yet .    in this paper",
    ", we will experimentally demonstrate rsp for a special quantum state ( i.e. , a qubit chosen from equator or polar great circles of a bloch sphere ) , with a 2-qubit sample , carbon-13 labeled chloroform @xmath0chcl@xmath2 and complete the task that 1 ebit + 1 cbit transmits 1 qubit .",
    "for the general case , lo@xcite conjectured that the classical communication cost of rsp is equal to that of teleportation , and their procedure would be similar .",
    "bennett et al.@xcite showed that , in the presence of a large amount of prior entanglement , the asymptotic classical communication cost of rsp for general states is one bit per qubit .",
    "however , the experimental verification of the asymptotic character requires preparation of a large amount of entanglement source , which would be difficult to implement by the existing techniques .",
    "consider an arbitrary single qubit state @xmath3 where @xmath4 is chosen to be real and @xmath5 , a complex number .",
    "the state can be represented by a point in a bloch sphere with two real parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and obtained by a transformation @xmath8 on @xmath9 with @xmath10 the task of rsp is that alice helps bob in a distant laboratory to prepare the state @xmath11 known to her but unknown to bob .",
    "pati@xcite proposed a procedure for rsp of a qubit chosen from equatorial or polar line on a bloch sphere .",
    "the schematic circuit for rspis shown in fig .",
    "similar to teleportation , at first , alice and bob share a two - qubit maximal entangled state , i.e. an epr state , @xmath12 @xmath13 can be expanded in different orthogonal basis .",
    "we choose the qubit orthogonal basis @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 is the complex conjugate of @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the inverse of @xmath20 which is a unitary operator to convert @xmath21 into @xmath22 it is possible for alice to perform a single particle von - neumann measurement under the basis because of the state @xmath23 known to her .",
    "conditional on alice s two measurement outcomes latexmath:[$%    is either @xmath23 or @xmath25 thus , after alice performs the measurement , she sends the result ( one classical bit information ) to bob , who can then recover the desired state @xmath11 by deciding to do nothing @xmath26 or a unitary operation @xmath20 according to the received classical information . for a special ensemble",
    ", @xmath20 can be an affirmative unitary operator to transform @xmath27 into @xmath22 for example , if alice choose to prepare a polar great circles on a bloch sphere , i. e. , @xmath28 then @xmath29 alternatively , if alice wish to help bob prepare an arbitrary equatorial state such as @xmath30 then @xmath31 however , for a general state ( both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary ) , there is no universal transformation @xmath20 to take @xmath32 in nmr experiments , suppose that alice and bob have spin @xmath33 and spin @xmath34 , respectively , consisting of a bipartite spin quantum system in a @xmath35 hilbert space @xmath36 the epr pair can be prepared from a pure state @xmath37 by the operations of not ( @xmath38 flips the sign of spin @xmath39 ) , the hadamard gate ( @xmath40 transform the states according to ( @xmath41 ) and controlled - not ( @xmath42 flips spin @xmath34 if and only if @xmath33 is latexmath:[$%    @xmath42 gates were respectively realized by the pulse sequences @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( pulses applied from right to left ) . by simplification methodology@xcite ,",
    "the epr pair was realized by using the pulse sequence    @xmath47",
    "\\(2 ) * the single particle von - neumann measurement under the qubit basis * @xmath48 we use a two - part procedure inspired by brassard et al . to perform the measurement @xcite .",
    "part one of the procedure is to rotate from the basis @xmath49 into the computational basis @xmath50 by the transformation @xmath51 inverse of @xmath8 .",
    "part two of the procedure is to perform a projective measurement in the computational basis .    applying @xmath52 on the epr  pair",
    ", one gets @xmath53 for a polar state , the operation @xmath54 which can be realized by the nmr pulse sequence @xmath55 for an equatorial state , the operation @xmath56 which can be realized by the nmr pulse sequence @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59    it is possible to simulate directly the second step in nmr exploiting magnetic gradient pulses@xcite .",
    "however , it can be seen from eq .",
    "( 6 ) that , the final state of alice is one of @xmath9 and @xmath60 corresponding to the two different measurement results",
    ". owing to the weak measurement of nmr , we can employ the conditional unitary operation @xmath61 , instead of the projective measurement in the computational basis and the post - measurement operation .",
    "\\(3 ) * conditional unitary operation * @xmath61*. * it can be verified from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , that when alice measures the outcome of spin @xmath33 @xmath9 , bob performs the transformation @xmath20 on spin @xmath34 ; when @xmath62 , bob does nothing , then two measurement results lead to bob in @xmath22 for a polar state , @xmath63 the conditional unitary operation @xmath64 is implemented by the pulse sequence    @xmath65    for an equatorial state , @xmath66 the conditional unitary operation @xmath67 is implemented by the pulse sequence    @xmath68",
    "\\(4 ) * the measurement of the final state*. after tracing out spin @xmath33 the state of spin @xmath34 is reduced to the expected form @xmath69 which indicates the success of rsp . in principle , spin @xmath33 could be traced out experimentally by applying a decoupling field during observation of spin @xmath34 . but this approach was found to lead to unacceptable sample heating , with resultant shifts in resonance frequencies .",
    "thus , the tracing out process was implemented in software by integrating the entire multiplet of spin b after adjusting the right phase .",
    "the rsp scheme stated above was implemented by liquid - state nmr spectroscopy with carbon-13 labeled chloroform @xmath70 ( cambridge isotope laboratories , inc . ) . to perform rsp",
    "we make use of the hydrogen nucleus @xmath71 as the sender ( alice ) and the carbon nuclei @xmath72 as the receiver ( bob ) in the experiments , transmitting the state from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "spectra were recorded on a brukerarx500 spectrometer with a probe tuned at 125.77mhz for @xmath75 , and at 500.13mhz for the @xmath73 .",
    "the spin - spin coupling constant @xmath76 between @xmath75 and @xmath73 is 214.95hz .",
    "the relaxation times were measured to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the proton , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 for carbon nuclei .",
    "the pseudo - pure state was prepared in our experiment using line - selective pulses and the gradient - pulse techniques @xcite .",
    "we performed two separate sets of experiments of the rsp process ( shown in fig.2 ) from @xmath73 to @xmath81 as all nmr observables are traceless and the constant item has no effect on the nmr signal , any point on the bloch sphere can be expressed as the product form @xmath82 ( apart from a constant unit matrix ) , which corresponds to the observable nmr signal . using alice s knowledge of the qubit ,",
    "an advanced operation @xmath83 was performed on @xmath73 for a given set of @xmath84 and @xmath7 values . in the first set , a total of 25 qubit states chosen from a range of points on the polar line of the bloch sphere @xmath85 with a @xmath6 spacing of @xmath86",
    "were studied .",
    "the second set of experiments was executed for rsp  of 17 equatorial states on the bloch sphere @xmath87 with a @xmath7 spacing of @xmath88 for each state the experimental spectra of @xmath75 were recorded from the @xmath75 nucleus , and their real and imaginary components are plotted in fig .",
    "the experimental results clearly show the expected line , sine and cosine modulations . it can be seen from fig .",
    "2 , there exists an same initial phase offset in the fitting curves , which maybe caused by the systemic errors , such as static magnetic field and rf field inhomogeneities and the imperfect calibrations of rf pulses , etc .. furthermore , we reconstructed the density matrices of the obtained states by quantum state tomography@xcite , and the maximal relative errors @xmath89 where    @xmath90    and @xmath91 is the expectative state of rsp , and @xmath92 is the reconstructed state by the experimental data . besides static magnetic field and rf field inhomogeneities and the imperfect calibrations of rf pulses , the errors in experiments arise from decoherence due to the @xmath93 relaxations of nuclei and the environmental effects such as temperature .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out from fig . 2 and the reconstructed density matrices that the rsp network is effective for a special ensemble .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally implemented the rsp protocol by using nmr quantum logic gates and circuits in quantum information . in our experiments , rsp  of a special ensemble was successfully completed by a maximally entangled channel with one classical bit communication , exactly half that of teleportation , namely 1 cbit @xmath94 1 qubit .",
    "the special states distributes on the equatorial and polar circles on the bloch sphere .",
    "the rsp protocol can be generalized to remotely prepare a large number of general qubit states in the high - entanglement limit at an asymptotic cost of one bit per qubit @xcite . like teleportation",
    ", rsp can be applied not only to pure states , but also to parts of entangled states which has been studied by bennett et al.@xcite .",
    "although the communication happens between spins in angstrom distance , the concept and method of quantum information transmission should be useful for quantum computation and quantum communication .",
