    "the last few years have witnessed a tremendous activity devoted to the characterization and understanding of complex networks@xcite , which arise in a vast number of natural and artificial systems , such as internet@xcite , the world wide web@xcite , social networks of acquaintance or other relations between individuals@xcite , metabolic networks@xcite , food webs@xcite and many others@xcite .",
    "owing to the computerization of data acquisition process and the availability of high computing powers , scientists have found that the networks in various fields have some common characteristics , which inspires them to construct a general model .",
    "recently , some pioneer works have been done that bring us new eyes of the networks evolution mechanism .",
    "for instance , barabsi and albert s introduced a scale - free network model ( ba network)@xcite , which suggests that two main ingredients of self - organization of a network in a scale - free structure are growth and preferential attachment .",
    "so far , ba model may be the most successful model to fit the empirical results of complex system , but there are still a great number of real networks whose evolution mechanisms can not be explained by ba model . for truth , we should not ask for an all - powerful model which can explain the reason of a freewill real network coming into being , since many different networks have distinct underlying growth mechanism .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to construct a microscopic suitable model aiming at a special kind of networks .",
    "a particular class of networks is the so - called collaboration networks , which is considered to be a kind of social networks in the early studies . in the social science literatures ,",
    "a collaboration network is generally defined as a network of actors connected by common membership in group of some sort , such as clubs , teams or organizations . some empirical studies relevant to collaboration networks",
    "have been done , including scientific collaboration networks@xcite , board of directorships@xcite , movie actors collaboration networks@xcite , social events attending networks for women@xcite , and so on .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the extension of collaboration networks should not be restricted within social networks , one instance is the software collaboration networks@xcite , and we will show more examples of collaboration networks irrelated to social networks in the following text .",
    "ramasco , dorogovtsev and pastor - satorras have proposed a model for collaboration networks(rdp model)@xcite . in rdp model , they found the power law behavior in degree distribution , the nontrivial clustering - degree correlation and nontrivial degree - degree correlation .",
    "very recently , li et al have established a model for weighted collaboration networks in which both the power law weight distribution and degree distribution are obtained@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a general model for collaboration networks .",
    "depending on a single free parameter , the preferential exponent , this model interpolates between networks with a scale - free and an exponential degree distribution .",
    "the degree distributions of the present networks can be roughly classified into four patterns , and all of them are observed in empirical data . and this model exhibits small - world effect , which means the corresponding networks are of very short average distance and highly large clustering coefficient .",
    "more interesting , we find a peak distribution of act - size from empirical data which has not been emphasized before of some collaboration networks .",
    "our model can produce the peak act - size distribution naturally that agrees with the empirical data well .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce a simple and general model for collaboration networks . in section 3",
    ", we show the small - world effect exhibited by this model . in section 4 , we display the simulation results of degree distribution , and demonstrate that the degree distribution approximate to stretched exponential distribution@xcite with adjustable parameter @xmath0 . in section 5 , we show the simulation results and some empirical data of act - size distribution . the comparison and qualitative discussion are also included .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we draw the main conclusion of our work .",
    "our network starts with @xmath1 nodes which are fully connected . then , at each time step , we add a new node into the network which will have a collaboration with some existing nodes . inspired by ba model , we assume that the probability that an existing node @xmath2 is chosen to be an actor in the collaboration is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the degree of @xmath2 and @xmath5 is the so - called  preferential exponent \" denoting the degree of preferential attachment . for @xmath6 , we have preferential attachment .",
    "all the existing nodes which are chosen to be collaborated will link to the new node .",
    "that is to say if two chosen old nodes have never collaborated so far , there will be a new edge added connecting them .",
    "it is obvious that this model can be stretched to weighted one by using the times of collaborations between the corresponding two nodes as edge weight . since the aim of this paper is to introduce the characteristics of non - weighted networks , the simulation and analysis relevant to weighted networks",
    "will not be included , which will be published elsewhere .",
    "it should be taken note to that the act - size is not fixed at each time step since whether a certain node is chosen will not affect other nodes . we suppose that a node with degree @xmath4 will be chosen with the probability @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is a constant , and @xmath9 is the normalization factor . using @xmath10 presenting the average value of act - size such as the mean number of authors per paper",
    ", we will conclude that @xmath11 , since the number of nodes chosen each time has the expecting value @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is a parameter which can be used to control the average act - size of the whole network .",
    "therefore , when we simulate an idiographic network of known average act - size , the parameter @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "in a network , the distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting them . the average distance @xmath13 of the network ,",
    "then , is defined as the mean distance between two nodes , averaged over all pairs of nodes and often considered to be one of the most important parameters to measure the efficiency of communication networks .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath14 of node @xmath2 is the ratio between the number of edges among @xmath15 and the total possible number , where @xmath15 denotes the set of all the neighbors of @xmath2 .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath16 of the whole network is the average of @xmath14 over all @xmath2 .",
    "empirical studies indicate that most real - life networks have much smaller average distance ( as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of nodes in the network ) than the completely regular networks and much greater clustering coefficient than those of the completely random networks .",
    "and these two properties , small average distance and large clustering coefficient , make up of the so - called small world effect .    [ 0.9 ] the dependence between the average distance @xmath13 and the network size @xmath18 .",
    "one can see that @xmath13 increases very slowly as @xmath18 increases .",
    "the main plot exhibits the curve where @xmath13 is considered as a function of @xmath19 , which is well fitted by a straight line .",
    "the curve is above the fitting line when @xmath20 and under the fitting line when @xmath21 , which indicates that the increasing tendency of @xmath13 can be approximated as @xmath19 and in fact a little slower than @xmath19 .",
    "the inset shows the average distance @xmath13 vs @xmath22 , the error of linear - fitting by form @xmath22 is smaller than @xmath19 , indicating that the networks may be considered as ultrasmall world networks@xcite .",
    "all the data are obtained by 10 independent simulations with parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24.,title=\"fig : \" ]    inspired by the empirical studies on real - life networks , watts and strogatz proposed a one - parameter model(ws model ) that interpolates between an ordered finite - dimensional lattice and a random graph by randomly rewiring each edge of the regular lattice with probability @xmath25@xcite .",
    "in ws model , @xmath13 scales logarithmatically with @xmath18 , and the clustering coefficient decrease with @xmath18 , which is in excellent agreement with the characteristics of real networks .",
    "the pioneering article of watts and strogatz started an avalanche of research on the properties of small - world networks . in this section",
    ", we would like to demonstrate that the networks generated by the present rules display small - world effect .    at first",
    ", we study the average distance of the present model using the approach similar to that in references@xcite . using symbol @xmath26 to represent the distance between nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "the average distance of present networks with order @xmath18 , denoted by @xmath29 , is defined as : @xmath30 where the total distance is : @xmath31 the distance between two existing nodes will not increase with the increasing of network size @xmath18 , thus we have : @xmath32 assume that @xmath33 existing nodes , @xmath34 , are selected to collaborate with the new node @xmath35 , then @xmath36 is equal to the minimal distance between @xmath27 and any one of the @xmath33 nodes plus 1 : @xmath37 in a rough version , the sum @xmath38 can be expressed approximately in terms of @xmath39 : @xmath40 in order to avoid the network being unconnected , we always set @xmath41 and compel @xmath42 , which leads to @xmath43 .    combining those results",
    "above , we have : @xmath44 consider ( 7 ) as an equation , then the increasing tendency of @xmath45 is determined by the equation : @xmath46 which leads to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a constant . as @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 . which should be pay attention to , since ( 7 ) is an inequality in fact , the precise increasing tendency of @xmath13 may be a little tardier than @xmath19 .",
    "in figure 1 , we report the typical simulation result on average distance of the present networks under parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which agrees with the analytic result well .    [",

    "one can see clearly that the clustering coefficient of the present networks is sufficient large even for big @xmath18.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.9 ] the clustering coefficient vs preferential exponent @xmath5 .",
    "the two curves can be considered as the clustering coefficient as a function of @xmath5 with network size @xmath51 fixed , which increase monotonically with the increasing of @xmath5 .",
    "the main plot and inset are of @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "it is clear that the clustering coefficient is sensitive to the preferential exponent but influenced little by @xmath8.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in succession , let s discuss the clustering coefficient . as we mentioned above , for an arbitrary node @xmath2 ,",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath14 is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of edges between any two nodes in the neighbor - set @xmath15 of node @xmath2 , and @xmath56 denotes the degree of node @xmath2 .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath16 of the whole network is defined as the average of @xmath14 over all nodes .    in figure 2",
    ", we report the simulation results on clustering coefficient of the present networks vs network size . from figure 2",
    ", one can find that the clustering coefficient of the present networks is sufficient large even for big @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , our model exhibits completely different clustering structure from that of ba networks , in which the clustering coefficient is very small and decreases with the increasing of network size @xmath18 , following approximately @xmath57@xcite .",
    "in addition , we plot the clustering coefficient as a function of @xmath5 with network size @xmath51 fixed in figure 3 .",
    "the two curves with different @xmath8 are almost the same , thus the clustering coefficient is influenced little by @xmath8 .",
    "both of the two curves increase monotonically with @xmath5 , since @xmath5 represents the degree of preferential attachment , this phenomenon reveals that the huger difference between attraction of preponderant and puny individuals will lead to greater clustering behavior .",
    "even when the network grows without preferential attachment(i .",
    "e. @xmath58 ) , the clustering coefficient of our model is much greater than completely random networks , because of its special linking mode proposed here . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the clustering coefficient approximate 1 , and the structure of corresponding networks is similar to a star in topology@xcite .",
    "the difference is that in our networks with very large @xmath5 , the central part are not one node like star , but many nodes almost fully connected to each other .",
    "since the structure for networks with @xmath59 is much different from reality , we will not discuss their characteristics hereinafter .",
    "summing up , the present networks own both very large clustering coefficient and very small average distance which agree with previous empirical studies well .",
    "the degree distributions of real - life networks are various@xcite . some of them such as acquaintance network of mormons@xcite are guassian ; some such as power - grid of southern california are exponential@xcite and some such as network of world wide web are power - law@xcite",
    ". however , the degree distributions of most real - life networks do not obey these simple forms above , they may interpolate between guassian and exponential ones such as the network of world airports@xcite , or interpolate between exponential and power - law ones such as citation networks in high energy physics@xcite , or in another form@xcite .",

    "about four years ago , newman investigated the statistic properties of scientific collaboration networks .",

    "in fact , lehmann et al have shown an example where the observed double power - law can be well fitted by a stretched exponential form@xcite . in appendix",
    "a , the details about stretched exponential distribution(sed ) is shown , including the definition of sed , the basic properties of sed , the relations between sed and exponential distribution as well as power - law distribution , and the reason why we use sed in this paper .",
    "figure 4 shows the degree distribution of scientific collaboration network proposed by newman@xcite which can be well fitted by sed with @xmath71 indicating this distribution is more approximated to exponential form rather than power - law form .",

    "many real - life collaboration networks are of degree distribution lying between exponential and power - law ones that can be well fitted by stretched exponential form , and the present model can generate networks of degree distribution from  almost exponential \" to  almost power - law \" containing four patterns .",

    "is added to the network , the number of @xmath100 increases by @xmath98 , thus when the network is of order @xmath18 , the number of @xmath100 is @xmath101 .",
    "note that , when a given node s degree increases one , the number of @xmath100 containing this node increases @xmath102 , hence for any node with degree @xmath4 , it belongs to @xmath103 @xmath98-complete networks .",
    "let @xmath104 be the number of nodes with degree @xmath4 when @xmath18 nodes are present , now we add a new node to the network , @xmath104 evolves according to the following rate equation@xcite : @xmath105 when @xmath18 is large enough , @xmath104 can be approximated to @xmath106 , where @xmath60 is the probability density function for the degree distribution . in terms of @xmath60 ,",

    "the simulation result accurately agrees with the analytic one for large network size @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , there exists a bijection from node s degree to clustering coefficient as : @xmath113 the clustering coefficient of the whole network can be obtained as the mean value of @xmath114 with respect to the degree distribution @xmath60 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the minimal degree and @xmath117 is the maximal degree . combine eq.(b4 ) and eq.(b5 ) ,",
    "note that @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we can get the analytical result of @xmath16 by approximately treating @xmath120 as @xmath121 .",

    "the ba network , which does not possess hierarchical structure , is known to have the clustering coefficient @xmath14 of node @xmath2 independent of its degree @xmath123 , while the present network has been shown to have @xmath124 , in accord with the observations of many real networks@xcite .",
