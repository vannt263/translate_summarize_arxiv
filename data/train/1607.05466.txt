    "there is just one cycle , we make sure that the central vertex of @xmath17 ( i.e. , the unique one with degree @xmath3 ) is mapped to the central vertex of @xmath52 ( in the other cases , this goes automatically ) . for the remaining vertices ,",
    "which are all on cycles of length at least @xmath13 , we make sure that @xmath83 preserves the distance to the central vertex , as long as this distance is less than @xmath86 . because both @xmath17 and @xmath52 have the same number @xmath85 of `` remaining ( larger ) cycles '' , this is possible .",

    "for such a vertex @xmath88 , let us abbreviate @xmath89 by @xmath90 .",
    "note now that in every closed walk of length @xmath29 that starts in a given vertex @xmath88 ( in any graph ) , there are only vertices involved that are at distance at most @xmath91 from @xmath88 , and no edges are involved between those vertices that at are distance @xmath91 from @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore define the _ weighted rooted closed walk graph _ @xmath92 as the subgraph of @xmath17 induced on the vertices at distance at most @xmath91 from @xmath88 from which the edges , if any , between the vertices at distance exactly @xmath91 from @xmath88 have been removed .",
    "moreover , we assign @xmath88 as its root and take the degree of a vertex in the original graph as its weight . with this definition , @xmath87 equals the weighted number of closed walks of length @xmath29 in @xmath92 that start in its root .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath93 as a weighted rooted closed walk graph of @xmath52 . in order to compare @xmath87 to @xmath94",
    ", we can now restrict to comparing weighted closed walks in @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    for @xmath63",
    ", it is straightforward to check that the weighted rooted graphs @xmath92 and @xmath93 are isomorphic for all @xmath88 ( where we recall that @xmath95 ) , and hence @xmath96 for all @xmath88 . thus , follows .",
    "the situation for @xmath97 is more subtle of course , but except for the central vertex and those vertices @xmath88 that are on an @xmath13-cycle while @xmath90 is not , the _ unweighted _ rooted closed walk graphs @xmath92 and @xmath93 are again isomorphic .",
    "note that in this case we count unweighted closed walks , and indeed , this implies that @xmath98 , except in the described cases .",
    "if @xmath88 is on an @xmath13-cycle while @xmath90 is not , then it in fact follows that @xmath99 , because there are two extra closed walks ; those walking around the @xmath13-cycle ( with two directions possible ) . also if @xmath88 is the central vertex , then @xmath100 .",
    "all together , this shows .",
    "as argued before , this gives a contradiction , thus proving the induction , and therefore that @xmath17 and @xmath52 are isomorphic .",
    "for the adjacency matrix , the result in proposition [ genlap ] can also be obtained in a different way , namely by using sachs theorem @xcite . in memory of professor horst sachs , one of the authors of the influential monograph @xcite on spectra of graphs , we include a sketch of this alternative proof here .",
    "let us first recall sachs theorem",
    ".    given a graph @xmath17 on @xmath21 vertices and a positive integer @xmath36 , a sachs @xmath36-subgraph @xmath101 of @xmath17 is a disjoint union of cycles and edges on a total of @xmath36 vertices . the number of components of @xmath101 and the number of cycles in @xmath101 are denoted by @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "we denote the set of sachs @xmath36-subgraphs of @xmath17 by @xmath104 .",
    "sachs theorem expresses the coefficient @xmath105 of ( the term @xmath106 of ) the characteristic polynomial of @xmath17 in terms of its sachs subgraphs as @xmath107 for example , from this it follows that @xmath108 , @xmath109 equals the number of edges of @xmath17 , and @xmath110 equals twice the number of triangles of @xmath17 .    in the rose graphs that we are considering in this paper , a sachs subgraph is either the disjoint union of one cycle and a matching ( a disjoint union of edges ) , or simply a matching . for both cases , counting sachs subgraphs",
    "boils down to counting matchings in disjoint unions of paths .",
    "indeed , once a cycle is chosen as subgraph ( and  removed \" from the rose graph ) , a disjoint union of paths remains in which matchings have to be counted . to count the number of @xmath29-matchings ( disjoint unions of @xmath29 edges ) in a @xmath2-rose graph",
    ", we can distinguish between those matchings that contain an edge through the central vertex and those that do not . to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath111 denote the number of @xmath29-matchings in a graph @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath17 is a @xmath2-rose graph with central vertex @xmath112 that is adjacent to vertices @xmath77 for @xmath113 , then it is clear that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the graph obtained from @xmath17 by removing @xmath112 ( and incident edges ) , and similarly @xmath116 is the graph obtained by removing @xmath112 and @xmath77 , for @xmath113 .",
    "clearly all these graphs are disjoint unions of paths . for our result , we do not have to derive the actual number of matchings in a disjoint union of paths ( or in a @xmath2-rose graph ) ; instead it will suffice to use the following .",
    "[ samenumber ] let @xmath117 be positive integers .",
    "the number of @xmath36-matchings in any disjoint union of @xmath2 paths , each on at least @xmath36 vertices , on a total of @xmath21 vertices , is independent of the lengths of the individual paths .    in order to prove this ,",
    "we use induction on @xmath36 . for @xmath78",
    ", we have to count the number of edges , which is clearly the same , i.e. , @xmath118 , for every disjoint union of @xmath2 paths on a total of @xmath21 vertices .    to prove the induction step , let @xmath119 , and assume that the result is true for @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath121 and @xmath122 be two graphs that are disjoint unions of @xmath2 paths , with @xmath123 and @xmath124 for every @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath127 , where @xmath128 for @xmath125 .",
    "the graph @xmath129 can be obtained from both @xmath17 and @xmath52 , by deleting the same number of vertices , @xmath85 say .",
    "in fact , this can be done by a sequence of @xmath85 steps , where in each step @xmath130 we remove a pendant vertex @xmath131 and its corresponding edge @xmath132 from @xmath17 and pendant vertex @xmath133 and its corresponding edge @xmath134 from @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we have sequences of graphs @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , for @xmath130 , and finally @xmath141 . in this way , @xmath142 and @xmath143 are disjoint unions of @xmath2 paths , and each path is on at least @xmath36 vertices , for every @xmath144 .    by distinguishing between matchings that do not contain any of the edges @xmath145 , for @xmath130 , and those that do , we obtain the expression @xmath146 indeed ,",
    "@xmath147 is the number of @xmath36-matchings of @xmath17 that do not contain any of the edges @xmath145 , for @xmath130 , whereas @xmath148 is the number of @xmath36-matchings of @xmath17 that contain @xmath145 , but none of the edges @xmath149 .",
    "similarly , we obtain that @xmath150    by the induction hypothesis , and because @xmath151 and @xmath152 have the same number of vertices and they are both disjoint unions of paths , each on at least @xmath120 vertices , it now follows from and that @xmath153 , which finishes the proof .",
    "we note that the condition that each of the paths has at least @xmath36 vertices is necessary in general .",
    "for example , @xmath154 has no @xmath4-matchings , whereas @xmath155 does have one .",
    "still , we will use the above result in cases where the two disjoint unions of paths may have some paths of too small a size .",
    "however , the two graphs will only differ in the `` larger '' paths , and in that case using the above result still gives the same numbers of matchings .",
    "let us now finish the sketch of the proof .",
    "consider two @xmath2-rose graphs @xmath17 and @xmath52 that have the same adjacency spectrum , and hence the same coefficients @xmath156 and @xmath157 , for @xmath158 of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "like in the proof of proposition [ genlap ] , we aim to show by induction on @xmath13 that the two graphs have the same number of @xmath13-cycles .",
    "let @xmath14 and assume that the two graphs have the same number of @xmath29-cycles for @xmath159 .",
    "let us consider sachs @xmath13-subgraphs of @xmath17 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath160 .",

    "there may be paths of size at most @xmath163 coming from cycles of size at most @xmath164 , but there are equally many of each length in the two graphs under consideration , and hence the number of @xmath165-matchings is the same .",
