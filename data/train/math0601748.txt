    "several papers have addressed , in the last few years , the problem of isotopy of symplectic surfaces representing the same homology class @xmath0 of a simply connected , symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath2 .",
    "although a list of the results obtained in those papers is beyond the scope of this introduction , we just want to mention the existence of both uniqueness and non - uniqueness results , depending on the choice of the pair @xmath3 .",
    "the prototypical example of a non - uniqueness result , further discussed in this paper , is the presence of infinitely many non - isotopic symplectic tori representing any multiple of the fiber class of ( some ) elliptic surfaces .",
    "the idea behind this construction , developed by fintushel and stern in @xcite , is to obtain nonequivalent symplectic tori by braiding parallel copies of a symplectic torus .",
    "all known examples of non - uniqueness , so far , have been genus @xmath4 representatives of a homology class of self - intersection @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the few higher genus cases under control have always led to uniqueness results as in @xcite .",
    "the interest in obtaining examples of non - isotopic symplectic surfaces of higher genus has been pointed out by many researchers , in particular , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is no special reason to expect that non - isotopy phenomena should be restricted to genus @xmath4 , self - intersection @xmath5 surfaces .",
    "in fact , if we also take into account @xmath1-manifolds with non - trivial fundamental groups , smith has shown in @xcite the existence of higher ( odd ) genus examples , and examples of symplectic curves with cusp singularities have been provided ( for the projective plane ) in @xcite .",
    "however , all attempts to build higher genus examples in simply connected @xmath1-manifolds by suitably  doubling \" the braiding construction have failed .",
    "the reason for the failure is the impossibility of detecting non - isotopy ( for potential examples ) either by using the seiberg - witten invariants or by using a more classical topological invariant like the fundamental group of the complement . in the latter approach ,",
    "the reason is that most of the basic building blocks , genus @xmath4 surfaces built through the braiding construction , can not be distinguished by means of the @xmath6 either , as first observed in @xcite .",
    "however , there is a second mechanism , different from the original braiding construction , that allows us to produce non - isotopic symplectic tori in a symplectic @xmath1-manifold ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this alternative construction originates from the presence of non - isotopic , nullhomologous lagrangian tori in a large class of ( simply connected ) symplectic @xmath1-manifolds ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these symplectic tori are obtained by  summing \" a preferred symplectic torus with non - isotopic nullhomologous tori .",
    "the non - isotopy can be detected , as for the braiding construction , by using seiberg - witten theory , but the advantage of this second construction is that , in many cases , @xmath6 is sufficient to distinguish the tori , as shown in @xcite . and",
    "if we  double \" the construction , the fundamental groups of the complements may retain enough information to distinguish the resulting higher genus surfaces .",
    "in fact , following the ideas outlined above , we will be able to prove the following .",
    "[ main ] for any fixed integer @xmath7 , there exist simply connected , symplectic @xmath1-manifolds @xmath8 containing infinitely many homologous , pairwise non - isotopic , symplectic surfaces @xmath9 of genus @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , there is no pair homeomorphism between @xmath11 and @xmath12 unless @xmath13 .",
    "we briefly preview the idea of the construction .",
    "first , consider the symplectic simply connected 4-manifold @xmath14 obtained by the knot surgery construction of @xcite from the elliptic @xmath15 surface @xmath16 and a non - trivial fibered knot @xmath17 in @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath14 contains , for each @xmath7 , an infinite family of homologous , symplectic , non - isotopic tori @xmath19 , together with a symplectic surface @xmath20 of genus @xmath21 of self - intersection @xmath5 .",
    "this surface @xmath20 intersects each of the tori @xmath22 at @xmath23 positive transverse points . by doubling @xmath14 along @xmath20",
    "we obtain a symplectic , simply connected @xmath1-manifold @xmath24 . by summing together two copies of the torus @xmath22 , one copy from each side , we obtain a family of homologous genus @xmath10 , self - intersection @xmath5 symplectic surfaces @xmath25 .    by direct computation",
    ", we will show that if the fibered knot @xmath17 used in the construction of @xmath26 is non - trivial , then infinitely many of these surfaces @xmath25 have non - homeomorphic complements @xmath27 , distinguished by their fundamental groups .",
    "this proves , in particular , that the surfaces are not isotopic .",
    "in this section we will construct an infinite family of non - isotopic , symplectic surfaces of genus greater than or equal to @xmath28 for a class of simply connected , symplectic @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "these 4-manifolds are the manifolds denoted by @xmath26 , where @xmath17 is any fibered knot , introduced in @xcite .",
    "first we recall the construction of @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a fibered knot and let @xmath31 denote its genus .",

    "@xmath17 we can construct a symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath14 , homeomorphic to the elliptic surface @xmath16 ( the @xmath15 surface ) , obtained by knot surgery on @xmath16 with the knot @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we define @xmath51 where the gluing map @xmath52 is an orientation - reversing self - diffeomorphism on @xmath53 that is the identity on the @xmath49 factor and complex conjugation on the @xmath54 factor .    the following result is proved in @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 is a closed , simply connected , spin , irreducible , symplectic @xmath1-manifold .",

    "the symplectic @xmath1-manifold @xmath14 contains , for every @xmath7 , an infinite family @xmath57 of pairwise non - isotopic symplectic tori representing the homology class @xmath58 = q[s^{1 } \\times { \\bf m } ] \\in h_2(e(2)_k;{\\mathbb{z}})$ ] indexed by the integers @xmath59 coprime to @xmath23 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "there are two equivalent ways to present these tori .",
    "we start with the approach of @xcite .",
    "first , by looking at the construction of @xmath14 in ( [ knotsur ] ) , we can recognize a rim torus @xmath60 given by the image in @xmath14 of @xmath61 .",
    "as we can assume , up to isotopy , that a copy of the longitude @xmath62 lies on the fiber of @xmath33 ( given by the seifert surface @xmath32 capped off with a disk of the dehn filling ) , the torus @xmath60 can be assumed to be lagrangian . inside @xmath36",
    "the torus @xmath63 is the boundary of a solid torus ( as @xmath62 bounds a disk of the dehn filling ) but after the knot surgery this is not generally true anymore for @xmath60 ( for non - trivial @xmath17 ) .",
    "it remains , however , nullhomologous , as it bounds the @xmath34-manifold @xmath64 .",
    "take now a copy of @xmath65 pushed slightly inside @xmath66 , in such a way that it is transverse to the fibration and intersects each fiber in a curve isotopic to the longitude .",
    "the simple closed curves on this torus are the @xmath67-cables of @xmath17 , where @xmath68 ( remember that their linking number with @xmath17 is @xmath23 ) , with @xmath62 and @xmath69 themselves being the @xmath70- and the @xmath71-cables respectively . up to isotopy we can assume that , with the exception of @xmath70-cable , every @xmath67-cable is a curve transverse to the fibration , and its intersection with a fiber consists of positive points for @xmath7 .",
    "denote by @xmath72 the @xmath67-cable of @xmath17 , for any @xmath7 .",
    "we can say that this closed curve is obtained by _ circle sum _",
    "( in the sense of @xcite ) of @xmath23 copies of the meridian and @xmath59 copies of the longitude of @xmath17",
    ".    it will be useful in what follows to observe that the cable knot @xmath72 is contained in an enlarged tubular neighborhood @xmath73 of @xmath17 ( which we can assume to have , say , twice the radius of @xmath74 for some metric on @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that @xmath75 also fibers over @xmath76 .",
    "its fiber @xmath77 is strictly contained in @xmath32 , with @xmath78 isotopic to @xmath79 inside @xmath32 .",
    "the cable @xmath72 intersects the fiber @xmath32 at @xmath23 points @xmath80 contained in the knotted annulus @xmath81 , whose boundary is the union @xmath82 .",
    "figure [ rela ] illustrates the relations between these fibers and @xmath72 .     and fibers of the two knot exteriors ]",
    "as @xmath72 is transverse to @xmath32 the torus @xmath83 is symplectic in @xmath36 . for a fixed value of @xmath23 ,",
    "the tori @xmath84 are homologous , as the homology class of @xmath72 in @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 = q [ \\mu(k)]$ ] and the dehn filling does not affect this relation . ( if @xmath87 more is true , namely the tori @xmath88 are isotopic , the isotopy being supported in the solid torus of the dehn filling . ) after knot surgery , the images @xmath22 in @xmath14 of these tori remain homologous . in fact , the image of the homology class of the @xmath67-cable of @xmath17 , through the injective map @xmath89 is @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "however , infinitely many of the tori @xmath22 become non - isotopic .",
    "roughly speaking , the torus @xmath22 is the sum of @xmath23 copies of @xmath48 with @xmath59 copies of the nullhomologous lagrangian torus @xmath60 , and can be interpreted in terms of the cabling of @xmath48 itself .",
    "the family of tori @xmath22 will be the starting point of our construction , but note that we can extend the previous argument to include , instead of just @xmath67-cables of the knot @xmath17 , any curve in @xmath90 obtained as the circle sum of a number of copies of the meridian and a closed curve ( or a union of closed curves ) lying on the surface @xmath32 ( and thus homologous , but not necessarily isotopic to the longitude ) .",
    "with arguments similar to the ones above , we can achieve transversality for the resulting curves ; the symplectic tori obtained this way differ by the addition of nullhomologous lagrangian tori .",
    "details of this construction are presented in @xcite .    a second way to construct the family @xmath22 , presented in @xcite ,",
    "is the following .",
    "denote by @xmath91 the hopf link . in the knot exterior @xmath92",
    "we consider a standard pair of meridian and longitude , that we denote , to avoid confusion with @xmath69 and @xmath62 , by @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively .",
    "we have then the decomposition @xmath95 \\,\\cup\\ , \\big[s^1\\!\\times(s^3\\setminus \\nu h)\\big]\\,\\cup\\ , \\big [ s^1\\!\\times ( s^3\\setminus { { \\sf n}}k)\\big]\\ , , \\ ] ] with the first gluing identifying @xmath96 with @xmath97 and the second one identifying @xmath98 with @xmath99 factorwise , reversing the orientation on the last factor .",
    "( the bar over a curve refers to the negative orientation . )",
    "the equivalence between this construction and the construction of ( [ knotsur ] ) ( even in the symplectic category , with a suitable presentation as symplectic fiber sum ) simply follows by observing that the exterior of the hopf link is diffeomorphic to @xmath100 .    the torus @xmath22 is given by the image of @xmath101 $ ] , where @xmath102 is the @xmath67-cable of @xmath103 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : doublehopf ] for @xmath87 .",
    "the transversality of @xmath102 to the fibration of @xmath104 with fiber given by a disk spanning @xmath103 , pierced once by @xmath105 , is evident , and this entails that @xmath22 is symplectic . for fixed @xmath23 ,",
    "the curves @xmath102 are not homologous in @xmath104 , but they become so after gluing in @xmath92 with the prescription above , as the meridian @xmath106 becomes nullhomologous .",
    "therefore , the tori @xmath22 are homologous in @xmath14 for fixed @xmath23 .     in @xmath18 ]",
    "the equivalence between the two constructions of @xmath22 follows when we observe that the gluing of @xmath92 to @xmath104 in ( [ etgu - park construction ] ) is the _ splicing _ of @xmath17 and @xmath108 along @xmath109 , and the result of this operation is to produce a copy of @xmath90 , with the image of @xmath103 giving the knot @xmath17 and the image of the @xmath67-cable of @xmath103 ( i.e. @xmath110 ) giving the @xmath67-cable of @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath111 ) .",
    "( see @xcite , proposition 1.1 for a detailed discussion of this construction . )",
    "stated otherwise , we can think of the curve @xmath102 in the second construction as spiraling along an inner torus of @xmath112 ; after the gluing this inner torus gets identified with a copy of @xmath65 pushed inside @xmath90 , and hence @xmath102 is identified with @xmath72 in the first construction .",
    "note that , after the splicing , the disk spanning @xmath103 and pierced by @xmath105 ( that appears shaded in figure [ fig : doublehopf ] ) is identified with @xmath113 , which appears as the neck in figure [ rela ] .    now that we have defined the family @xmath114 we can construct , out of two copies of @xmath22 , the desired genus @xmath10 surface in @xmath26 . since in @xmath42 , @xmath115\\cdot[\\sigma_g]=q[f]\\cdot[\\sigma_g]=q[f]\\cdot[s ] = q\\,$ ] for each @xmath59 , we can internally sum two copies of @xmath23-times punctured @xmath22 from each of @xmath116 halves in ( [ d_k construction ] ) , and thus obtain a family of homologous , genus @xmath10 , self - intersection 0 surfaces @xmath117 inside @xmath29 .",
    "( we are going to follow the convention that @xmath118 . )",
    "see figure  [ fig : xi ] .     as the double of @xmath119    since",
    "each @xmath22 is symplectic in @xmath42 and our ambient @xmath1-manifold @xmath29 is a symplectic sum ( cf.@xmath120@xcite ) of two copies of @xmath42 along a symplectic surface @xmath49 , each @xmath25 is a symplectic submanifold of @xmath29 . in the next section",
    "we discuss how to distinguish the isotopy classes of submanifolds @xmath25 by comparing the fundamental groups of their complements in @xmath29 .",
    "the isotopy class of the torus @xmath22 inside @xmath14 can be detected via the seiberg - witten invariant of the fiber sum manifold @xmath121 ( that depends ultimately on the diffeomorphism type of the pair @xmath122 ) .",
    "it would be interesting ( and probably quicker ) to be able to use a similar approach to distinguish the diffeomorphism type of the pair @xmath123 .",
    "unfortunately , we currently lack a satisfactory machinery within the seiberg - witten theory to carry this out . however",
    ", we can use a classical approach to this problem , namely the study of the fundamental group of the exterior of @xmath25 .",
    "this allows us to prove an even stronger result , namely the existence of pairs @xmath123 that are not even homeomorphic .",
    "we were first led to this approach by the observation that the tori @xmath22 themselves can be distinguished by means of the fundamental group alone , as illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the reason underlying that phenomenon seems to be related to the role of the nullhomologous lagrangian tori in the construction of @xmath22 .    it remains an interesting question to determine whether there are homeomorphic pairs ( or at least pairs with the same fundamental group of the exterior ) which are not diffeomorphic .",
    "the main result of this section is the following theorem .",

    "theorem [ main ] now follows from theorem  [ thm : fundamental ] and the fact that when @xmath17 is a non - trivial knot , for a fixed value of @xmath23 , infinitely many choices of @xmath59 give mutually non - isomorphic groups @xmath129 .",
    "a proof of this latter statement is contained in @xcite .",
    "for some knot @xmath17 , we can explicitly determine infinite values of @xmath59 that lead to pairwise non - homeomorphic pairs .",
    "as an example , consider the figure eight knot .",
    "this knot is known to be fibered and hyperbolic .",
    "moreover , it is known ( see @xcite ) that , with @xmath130 explicit exceptions all having @xmath131 , its @xmath127-dehn surgery is a hyperbolic manifold . at this point",
    "we can invoke the result of @xcite which guarantees that , restricting ourselves to positive @xmath59 , no two surgeries give homeomorphic @xmath34-manifolds .",
    "mostow rigidity then implies that all the resulting manifolds have distinct fundamental groups .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : fundamental ] will occupy the remainder of this section .",
    "we start by observing that we have the following decomposition into halves @xmath132\\:\\cup\\:\\big[e(2)_k",

    "if we avoided removing the neighborhood of @xmath72 , the intersection of @xmath198 and @xmath201 being a 2-torus , seifert - van kampen theorem would give the obvious identifications @xmath205 , @xmath206 in the resulting 3-manifold ( and decomposition ( [ svk ] ) would simply be a redundant presentation of @xmath90 ) . instead , the intersection of @xmath209 and @xmath210 is an annulus @xmath211 , given by the exterior of @xmath72 in the torus @xmath212 .",
