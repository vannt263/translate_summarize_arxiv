    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of polarized leptons on polarized targets is used to study the spin structure functions of protons , neutrons , and light nuclei .",
    "the spin structure functions carry information about the distribution of the helicity of the target between its constituents .",
    "hence , studies of the spin structure functions are aimed at the understanding of the spin structure of nucleons and nuclei in terms of the underlying degrees of freedom , quarks and gluons .",
    "this work is concerned with the neutron spin structure function @xmath3 .",
    "free neutron targets are not available . instead , polarized deuterium and @xmath2he targets are used as sources of information on the polarized neutron .",
    "considerable experimental information on the structure function @xmath3 has been obtained so far .",
    "the hermes collaboration at desy @xcite and the e154 experiment at slac @xcite used a polarized @xmath2he target , while the smc collaboration at cern @xcite and the e143 experiment at slac @xcite used polarized deuterium . in both cases",
    "the extraction of the neutron structure function @xmath3 from the nuclear data required that nuclear effects be taken into account .",
    "the nuclear effects which play a role in polarized and unpolarized dis on nuclei can be divided into coherent and incoherent contributions .",
    "incoherent nuclear effects result from the scattering of the incoming lepton on each individual nucleon , nucleon resonance , or virtual meson .",
    "they are present at all bjorken @xmath8 .",
    "coherent nuclear effects arise from the interaction of the incoming lepton with two or more nucleons in the target .",
    "they are typically concentrated at low values of bjorken @xmath8 .",
    "nuclear shadowing at @xmath9 and antishadowing at @xmath10 are examples of coherent effects .",
    "an analysis of the role of nuclear shadowing and antishadowing as well as the @xmath11 transitions on the extraction of @xmath3 from the data on polarized dis on @xmath2he will be presented in a separate publication . in the present work",
    ", we do not consider shadowing and antishadowing effects since our main emphasis is on the region of high @xmath8 .",
    "for the case of polarized dis , the major contribution comes from the incoherent scattering on the nucleons of the target .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon tensor force gives rise to sizable higher partial waves in bound - state nuclear wave functions , notably the @xmath12 wave in the deuteron ground - state wave function as well as the @xmath13 and @xmath12 waves in the @xmath2he and @xmath2h ground - state wave functions .",
    "the presence of these partial waves in the nuclear ground - state wave functions leads to spin depolarization ( a decrease of the effective polarization ) of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xmath2he the effective polarization of the neutron is often quoted as @xmath14% , while the effective polarization of each proton is @xmath15% @xcite .",
    "these values represent the average of calculations with various nucleon - nucleon potentials and three - nucleon forces .",
    "however , the large error bars are very conservative as they have been taken to be 3 times the average value of the spread of the calculated points about the fit to these points @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we prefer to use the actual spread of the calculated values , namely , @xmath16% and @xmath17% for the effective polarization of the neutron and the protons , respectively .",
    "the importance of spin depolarization is well established .",
    "this effect was taken into account by the experimental collaborations named above when the neutron spin structure function @xmath3 was extracted from the dis data on polarized deuterium and @xmath2he . in order to extract the precise shape of @xmath3 one must also account for fermi motion as well as binding and off - shell effects . for deuterium the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and for @xmath2he those of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that simply accounting for spin depolarization is quite a good approximation at @xmath18 .    until now",
    ", other incoherent nuclear effects such as nucleon resonances and meson - exchange currents have been assumed to play a negligible role in polarized dis . on the other hand",
    ", one knows that exchange currents involving the @xmath5 resonance play a vital role in explaining the observed axial vector coupling constant of @xmath2h . through the generalization of the bjorken sum rule to the tri - nucleon system one",

    "we analyze the effect of @xmath5 on the extraction of @xmath3 from @xmath19 .",
    "it is well known that exchange currents involving a @xmath5 isobar allow one to account for the 4% discrepancy between the experimental value and theoretical predictions for the gamow - teller matrix element in triton beta decay @xcite .",
    "it was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that this 4% discrepancy straightforwardly translates into the language of deep inelastic scattering on tri - nucleon systems . in particular , calculations with realistic bound - state wave functions of @xmath2h and @xmath2he involving nucleons alone ,",
    "underestimate the ratio of the bjorken sum rules for the tri - nucleon system and for the nucleon by the same amount .",
    "the bjorken sum rule was derived using the algebra of currents @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the axial vector coupling constant measured in the @xmath23 decay of neutron , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections to this sum rule were calculated in perturbative qcd using the operator product expansion .",
    "they are denoted by `` @xmath25 '' .",
    "analogously , one can write for the difference of the spin structure functions of @xmath2h and @xmath2he @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the axial vector coupling constant measured in the @xmath23 decay of triton , @xmath28 @xcite .    taking the ratio of eqs .",

    "( [ master ] ) by about @xmath40% .",
    "as explained above , it is natural to expect that this discrepancy can be accounted for by including the dis diagrams which correspond to the transitions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds precisely to the two - body exchange currents involving the @xmath5 which appear in calculations of the gamow - teller matrix element for the triton beta decay .",
    "[ fig : one ] demonstrates the correspondence between the interference diagrams in polarized dis and the two - body exchange currents involving a @xmath5 entering the gamow - teller matrix element calculations .    in ref .",

    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "note also that the contribution of the dis diagrams involving the transition @xmath41 is neglected since the contribution of the corresponding diagrams to triton beta decay is negligible .",
