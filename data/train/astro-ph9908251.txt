    "among the galactic globular clusters ( gc ) , ngc6397 has so far been the preferred target in the quest for the lowest mass stars that could tell us much about the imf of these systems and clarify whether or not they can hide a substantial fraction of their total mass in the form of very light objects .",
    "the close proximity of ngc6397 ( @xmath24kpc ) coupled with its low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath25 ; djorgovski 1993 ) makes stars at the bottom of the main sequence ( ms ) relatively easy to observe with the powerful cameras on board the hst , and many have undertaken this challenge . our original work on this subject ( paresce , de  marchi , & romaniello 1995 ) revealed for the first time a marked deficiency of low - mass stars with respect to expectations based on a power - law mass function ( mf ) increasing all the way to the hydrogen - burning limit ( fahlman et al .",
    "these findings were questioned by cool , piotto , & king 1996 and chabrier & mra ( 1997 ) , but have since been largely confirmed by independent measurements ( mould et al .",
    "1996 ; king et al .",
    "1998 ) which all concur to suggest a mf that flattens out below @xmath16 .",
    "we argue in this paper that below @xmath26the mf drops all the way to the detection limit at the bottom of the stellar ms .",
    "although the results mentioned above seem to be consistent with each other , and thus rather robust , there are at least two practical issues that need to be carefully addressed .",
    "first of all , it is fair to wonder to which extent this deficiency of low - mass stars at the bottom of the ms is physical and genuine and how much of it should rather be attributed to some limitation inherent in the instrument or method of data analysis used .",
    "in fact , the observations carried out so far are confined to the optical domain ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ) , while low- and very - low mass stars such as those near the h - burning limit are expected to have a spectral energy distribution that peaks in the near - ir at @xmath27 m ( allard & hauschildt 1995 ) .",
    "if a large population of very faint and redder stars were present in this cluster , they might escape detection with the wfpc2 .",
    "secondly , the accurate determination of a luminosity function ( lf ) from these observations requires a reliable assessment of the contamination due to background unresolved galaxies and to field stars which are rather numerous at the low galactic latitude of ngc6397 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "attempts have been made to account and correct for this contamination using both color and proper motion information , but both methods are subject to some uncertainties .",
    "finally , a third , more general question needs to be addressed concerning the real meaning of these localized mf , namely whether the observed flattening at low masses is a feature inherent in the global mf ( gmf ) or , even , in the imf of the cluster , or whether it simply results from the internal dynamical modification of an originally completely different mass distribution .",
    "although richer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have proposed that , if measured near the half - mass radius , the present day mf should closely resemble the imf , no direct confirmation of this hypothesis exists yet .    in this paper , we address all three issues above .",
    "the first two are best attacked with the new nicmos camera on board the hst , which we have used to investigate the stellar population of ngc6397 precisely at the wavelengths where low mass stars are expected to shine the most , and to sample a control field located well outside of the cluster tidal radius to provide an independent estimate of field object contamination .",
    "we address the third issue by modelling the dynamical state of ngc6397 in section5 , where we put together all the lf currently measured for this cluster at various radial distances and compare them with the predictions of a multi - mass model that takes internal dynamical evolution ( mass segregation ) into account .",
    "the results of this paper are based on observations obtained by us with both the nic2 and nic3 cameras of the nicmos instrument on board the hst ( mackenty et al . 1997 ) .",
    "nic2 was used on 1997 , sep 30 to observe a region located @xmath29nw of the center of ngc6397 ( hereafter field f2 ) through the f110w and f160w broad band filters with a total exposure time of 10,235s and 4,027s , respectively .",
    "the field of view of the nic2 camera ( @xmath30@xmath31 ) was placed over an area previously imaged with the wfpc2 ( see paresce et al .",
    "a field closer to the cluster center was observed on 1998 , june 17 with the nic3 camera ( during the second `` nic3 campaign '' ) , when the @xmath32@xmath33fov was pointed to ra=17:40:54 , dec=53:42:57 ( j2000 ) corresponding to a distance of @xmath34 from the center ( hereafter field f1 ) and images were taken for a total exposure duration of 2,303s in f110w and of 703s in f160w . in units of the cluster s half - light radius ( @xmath35djorgovski 1993 ) ,",
    "our nic2 and nic3 fields are located , respectively , at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we also used the nic3 camera to observe a comparison field ( hereafter sky ) , located @xmath38ne of the cluster at ra=17:47:52 , dec=51:41:17 ( j2000 ) , to estimate the contamination due to field stars and correct for it in a statistical way .",
    "the filters and exposure times are identical to those used for the field f1 .",
    "the quality of all these data sets is excellent , with psf full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath39 for nic2 and of @xmath40 for nic3 ( achieved through the repositioning of hst s secondary mirror operated during the nic3 campaign ) .",
    "images were subjected to the standard stsdas calibration ( calnica ) to remove the instrumental signature ( bias and flat field correction ) and , in the case of the nic2 images , multiple frames of the same area and taken through the same filter were combined to improve the statistics .",
    "the average per - pixel count - rate of the background is of order @xmath41counts@xmath42 in f110w and @xmath43counts@xmath42 in f160w for the nic2 data , and @xmath44counts@xmath42 in f110w and @xmath45counts@xmath42 in f160w for nic3 images .",
    "these values , and particularly the standard deviation of the background , are larger than those predicted with the nicmos simulator , but still within a factor of two of them .",
    "the automated star detection routine _",
    "daophot.daofind _ was applied to the data , with a detection threshold conservatively set at @xmath46 above the local average background level ( the threshold was set to @xmath47 for the nic3 cluster field as it is more crowded than the others , and the severe psf under - sampling of nic3 makes it very difficult to detect and measure faint stars near brighter objects ) .",
    "we carefully examined by eye each individual object detected by daofind and discarded saturated stars , a number of features ( psf tendrils , noise spikes , etc . )",
    "that daofind had interpreted as stars , as well as a few extended objects ( with fwhm larger than twice that typical of point sources ) .",
    "the number of well defined objects detected in this way amounts to 517 in the f1 field , 58 in the f2 field , and 119 in the sky comparison field .",
    "we should notice here that we have used our knowledge of the quantum efficiency and filter transmission of nicmos in the f110w and f160w filters ( see pulone et al .",
    "1998 ) to select exposure times in these bands such that a typical m - type dwarf in ngc6397 would be detected with a similar snr in both bands . and",
    "indeed , with an exposure time about @xmath8 times longer in f110w than in f160w , all objects detected in one band are normally also visible in the other .    since crowding is not too severe in any of our images , stellar fluxes were measured using the standard _ digiphot.apphot _",
    "iraf aperture photometry routine , following the prescription of the `` core aperture photometry '' technique described in de  marchi et al .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were then calibrated and converted into the hst magnitude system ( stmag ) following the relation :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the number of counts measured for each star , @xmath50 the inverse sensitivity of the instrumental setup ( camera + filters ) , @xmath51 the encircled energy ( i.e. the aperture correction ) , and @xmath52 the total exposure time .",
    "the internal accuracy of our photometry ranges from @xmath53mag at @xmath54 to @xmath55mag at @xmath56 , although , particularly for the f110w observations taken with nic3 , the highly variable pixel response function of the camera can introduce statistical uncertainty of up to @xmath57 ( storrs 1998 ) . due to the current uncertainty affecting the photometric zero points of the nic3 camera ( nota et al .",
    "1998 ) , our absolute photometry is accurate to within the @xmath58 level . in order to make it easier to directly compare our results with those obtained from the ground , we translate our measurements from the stmag system into the vegamag photometric system of the hst , defined as one in which the magnitude of vega would be 0 in all bands and which is more similar to the classical johnson  cousin ground - based system . we adopt the vegamag system in this paper and do so by subtracting the zero - point constants of @xmath59mag and @xmath60mag from the values of the stmag magnitudes in the f110w and f160w bands , respectively . in the following , we refer to these magnitudes as to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .    with the magnitudes measured in this way we have produced the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) shown in figure1 ( panels a ",
    "the ms of cluster stars is well defined in the f1 field ( nic3 , figure1a ) , extending from @xmath61 to @xmath62 where it broadens due to increasing photometric errors .",
    "the ms of the stars in the f2 field ( figure1b ) is sparser and less well defined , but it occupies the same region in the cmd as that of the f1 field .",
    "the latter , however , appears consistently broader than the former at any magnitude .",
    "this effect is likely to be the result of the non uniformity of the sensitivity across the surface of the pixels of the nic3 camera ( storrs 1998 ) , coupled with the severe under - sampling of the psf .",
    "the expected ensuing uncertainty in the photometry is larger for the f110w data ( of order @xmath63 ) than for the f160w filter ( @xmath64 ) , and is in agreement with the observed ms broadening .",
    "the lines in figure1a and 1b represent the theoretical ms of a 10gyr old population with the metallicity and distance appropriate to ngc6397 as obtained using the models of baraffe et al .",
    "we have assumed the metal content @xmath65=-1.9 $ ] and extinction coefficient @xmath66 as given by djorgovski ( 1993 ) , but have let the distance take on two different values , i.e. @xmath67 from djorgovski ( 1993 ; solid line in figure1 ) and @xmath68 from reid & gizis ( 1998 ; dashed line ) .",
    "the theoretical sequences reproduce very well our observations , and , particularly , the change of slope occurring at @xmath69 and due to the change of the main source of opacity in the atmosphere of the stars from h@xmath70 to h@xmath71 . because of the uncertainty in the zero point of our photometry and of the broadening of the ms due to the intra - pixel sensitivity variation of the nic3 camera we can not decide which of the two distance scales is more appropriate , in that they are both consistent with our observations .",
    "the mass values printed along the right - hand axes of figure1 are derived from the m - l relation of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a distance modulus of @xmath68 ( reid & gizis 1998 ) .    comparing",
    "the cmd of the f1 field with that of the sky field ( figure1c ) immediately reveals that field stars ( mostly disk objects , owing to the low galactic latitude of ngc6397 , @xmath72 ) occupy exactly the same location in the diagram as the cluster objects .",
    "it is thus not possible to assign cluster membership to a star on the basis of its color alone .",
    "this is precisely why we have secured observations of the sky field so as to be able to account in a statistical way for the contamination due to field stars and affecting our lf ( see section3 ) .",
    "a robust determination of the lf also requires proper correction for the photometric incompleteness due to crowding .",
    "we have thus carried out several standard artificial star tests by adding artificial stars with magnitude values covering the whole range spanned by our observations .",
    "for fields f2 and sky we have generated 10 artificial images per filter adding each time respectively 8 and 20 stars , and have found that more than 90% of the artificially added objects are recovered at any magnitude level .",
    "the limited crowding and our conservative choice of a @xmath46 detection threshold combine in such a way that artificial stars are always retrieved unless they fall onto another object . in field f1 , however , crowding is more severe .",
    "we ran 20 tests per filter adding 40 stars each time and found that 90% of the artificially added objects are recovered at @xmath73 but the completeness gradually drops to @xmath74 at @xmath62 as shown in table1 .",
    ".table 1  photometric completeness in the f1 field [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to derive the lf of ms stars in the cluster we have counted the number of objects as a function of the @xmath5 magnitude in the cmd corresponding to fields f1 and f2 .",
    "we have determined in this way the number of stars in each @xmath75 mag bin ( 1-mag bins were used for f2 ) , which is then multiplied by the incompleteness coefficient .",
    "this latter step needs only be performed for stars in field f1 , as the photometric incompleteness is negligible in fields f2 and sky , where the poisson statistics of the counting process dominates the final uncertainty on the lf . in order to account in a statistical way for field star contamination , we then subtracted from each bin the number of objects measured in the same magnitude bin of the cmd of field sky ( the area covered by sky is the same as f1 and seven times larger than f2 ) .",
    "the lf obtained in this way are shown in figure2 in a linear scale as a function of the observed @xmath5 band magnitude .",
    "although the lf in field f2 ( bottom of figure2 ) spans a narrower magnitude range than that obtained with nic3 in f1 ( top histogram ) because of saturation of the few bright stars in field f2 , within the experimental errors the two lf agree very well with each other over the common magnitude interval , once properly scaled . indeed , although the former lf is affected by large uncertainty , its shape is not different from that measured in f1 , with which it agrees well after having been scaled vertically by a factor of @xmath76 to account for the the larger area covered by f1 .",
    "both lf show a peak near @xmath77 followed by a clear drop all the way down to @xmath62 , where they become statistically consistent with zero .",
    "the error bars plotted in figure2 reflect the @xmath78 uncertainty obtained by combining the poisson statistics on the number counts with the statistical uncertainty associated with the background subtraction .",
    "we note here , however , that we have associated a @xmath79 error bar to the bins in which the net number of stars is @xmath80 , as in these cases the uncertainty can largely exceed the determined value and one might prefer to use a @xmath79 upper limit instead .",
    "nevertheless , it is noteworthy that the number of stars becomes compatible with being zero at magnitude very close to that expected for the ms h - burning limit for stars with the metallicity of ngc6397 ( baraffe et al .",
    "ngc6397 is the first globular cluster for which a deep , reliable lf became available from wfpc2 photometry of ms stars all the way to the bottom of the ms ( paresce et al .",
    "so far , two other independent studies exist with the wfpc2 that confirm the deficiency of faint stars near the half - light radius of this cluster discovered by paresce et al .",
    "( cool et al . 1996 ; king et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a direct comparison of those observations , carried out at optical wavelengths , with our new ir data could clarify whether the wfpc2 is efficient at detecting faint , red dwarfs or whether it has missed a large amount of the very low mass objects that could potentially account for a conspicuous fraction of the total mass of gc .",
    "the first step in this attempt is to compare deep optical ( @xmath1 band ) and ir ( @xmath5 band ) images of the same area ( field f2 ) , as we do in figure3 .",
    "it is immediately evident that all the objects detected with nicmos in the @xmath5 band with a @xmath81min exposure ( left panel ) are also present in the @xmath82min wfpc2 image through the @xmath1 band filter ( f814w , right panel ) .",
    "the arrow indicates a star with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 which , using the distance modulus of reid & gizis ( 1998 ) and the m - l relation of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for [ m / h]@xmath87 , translates to a mass of @xmath88 , namely that expected for an object close to the h - burning limit in this cluster ( baraffe et al .",
    "since this object is clearly visible in all bands ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) , it is unlikely that the wfpc2 has underestimated the number of low - mass stars . in principle , then , one should expect the two instruments to give the same lf , but since the number of stars common to both nicmos and wfpc2 is small , statistical fluctuations might be important .    a second , perhaps better way to reveal any significant difference between the results of nicmos and the wfpc2 data is to compare the ir and optical lf to one another .",
    "the wavelength difference , however , would require a transformation from one photometric system to the other , which would inevitably introduce uncertainties that we want to avoid . to minimize possible systematic errors , we prefer to compare to one another the theoretical mf that best fit our visible and ir data .    in figure4a we show the lf of field f1 in units of absolute @xmath5-band magnitude @xmath89 , assuming a distance modulus of @xmath90 ( reid & gizis 1998 ) and @xmath66 ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "figure4b shows the lf in the @xmath1 band ( f814w ) as measured by paresce et al .",
    "( 1995 ) with the wfpc2 , also converted to absolute magnitude units @xmath91 .",
    "the lf in the @xmath1 band does not cover the whole ms , in that it stops at the bright end @xmath24 mag before reaching the turn - off ( @xmath92 ) due to saturation .",
    "since it is often assumed for simplicity that , even over a wide mass range , the stellar mf is well represented by a power - law distribution of the form @xmath93 ( see , however , scalo 1998 about the large range spanned by @xmath94 ) , we initially adopt such a functional form for the theoretical mf .. the two exponents @xmath94 and @xmath95 are such that @xmath96 , with salpeter s imf taking on the value of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . throughout the rest of the paper",
    "we will use the linear notation ( @xmath94 ) , except for figure6 which , as we explain , is best displayed in logarithmic units . ]",
    "the dashed lines in figure4 show the theoretical lf obtained by multiplying a power - law distribution by the derivative of the m - l relation appropriate to ngc6397 ( baraffe et al .",
    "this m - l relation is adopted here because it is the only one presently available that takes into account all the stellar physics on the problem and that fits very well all available data on the cmd of globular clusters .",
    "the inspection of figure4a and 4b immediately reveals that a single - exponent power - law distribution is not a viable choice for the underlying mf at this position , regardless of the value of @xmath94 . and indeed , while the bright portion of the lf up to the peak at @xmath99 , @xmath100 requires @xmath101 ( acceptable fits are found for @xmath102 in the @xmath5 band , and @xmath103 in the @xmath1 band ) , a much shallower exponent @xmath104 ( @xmath105 in @xmath5 , @xmath106 in @xmath1 ) is needed to fit the dropping portion of the lf beyond the peak . at the same time , figure4 shows that the same type of mf applies to both the optical and ir data , i.e. one that flattens out and drops at @xmath107 , close to the peak of the lf when adopting the m - l relation of baraffe et al . with the distance modulus and reddening values given above .",
    "in other words , the peak and turn over observed in all the lf measured so far for ngc6397 near the half - mass radius ( paresce et al .",
    "1995 , de marchi & paresce 1997 , king et al .",
    "1998 ) can not be attributed exclusively to the change of slope of the m - l relation at @xmath16 .",
    "this result is fully consistent with the conclusions of paresce et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and de marchi & paresce ( 1997 ) , showing that they apply to the ir as well .",
    "_ we can , therefore , exclude that near the half - light radius of ngc6397 the mf of the stellar population is represented by a single - exponent power - law distribution _ as advocated by chabrier & mra ( 1997 ) and silvestri et al .",
    "chabrier & mra ( 1997 ) reach this conclusion by assuming that the last four bins of paresce et al .",
    "( 1995 ) can be safely ignored as being seriously affected by incompleteness .",
    "this is now known not to be the case .",
    "silvestri et al . ( 1998 ) reach this conclusion by using a model that is inconsistent with the observed cmd of ngc6397 and other clusters .",
    "this is most likely due to their use of a grey - like atmosphere approximation which chabrier & baraffe ( 1997 ) have convincingly demonstrated to be wrong below @xmath108 .",
    "it is well known that , through the relaxation process , stars in gc tend to reach energy equipartition and , as a result , their mass spectrum can vary in time and space ( spitzer 1987 ) so that , for instance , the mf measured in the core of a cluster in thermal equilibrium should decrease with decreasing luminosity .",
    "paresce , de marchi , & jedrzejewski ( 1995 ) , king , sosin , & cool ( 1995 ) , and de marchi & paresce ( 1996 ) have indeed shown this to be precisely the case , in the mass range @xmath109 , respectively for 47tuc , ngc6397 , and m15 . at this juncture , it is fair to wonder whether the flattening below @xmath16that we now observe in the mf of field f1 and f2 is an intrinsic feature of the imf , or perhaps a characteristic signature of the global mf , or whether it simply is the result of some local dynamical effects bearing no relation whatsoever with either the imf or the global mf . although conventional wisdom and theoretical models suggest that away from both the cluster center and from its periphery these effects should be rather modest ( richer et al .",
    "1991 ; vesperini & heggie 1997 ) , no unambiguous proof exists that this hypothesis is correct , nor does one exactly know where ( if anywhere ) the local mf should be most insensitive to dynamical modifications .",
    "thus , since ngc6397 is probably in an advanced evolutionary state and has probably already gone through the collapse phase , the two - body relaxation process that has strongly changed the properties of the stellar population in the cluster s core ( king et al .",
    "1995 ) might have worked its effects farther out in the periphery , possibly imparting non negligible modifications onto the mf in the regions that we observed . and indeed , a careful inspection of figure4 already reveals that , although similar , the mf that best fits the lf in field f1 is not precisely the same that one requires to properly reproduce the lf observed in field f2 ( see discussion above ) .    in an attempt to clarify this issue and to put more stringent constraints on the shape of the cluster s global mf ( and , possibly , on its imf ) , we have computed the effect of the segregation mechanism in ngc6397 by using a dynamical model of the cluster so that we could compare our observations with the predicted shapes of the lf at several radial positions . besides the data obtained in field f1 ( @xmath110 ) with nic3 and in field f2 ( @xmath111 ) with wfpc2 and nic2 , we have included in this exercise the data taken with the wfpc2 by mould et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in a field located @xmath112n of the cluster center . in order to ensure that the comparison of these latter data to our own observations is not hampered by possible differences in the way they were reduced ,",
    "we have extracted from the hst archive the images taken by mould et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and have subjected them to the same , homogeneous data processing that we have applied to our wfpc2 observations of ngc6397 ( paresce et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "observations of mould et al.s field ( hereafter called f3 ) are available through both the f555w and f814w bands , with a total exposure time of @xmath113s in each filter .",
    "this has allowed us to build a cmd in all ways similar to that of mould et al .",
    "( see their figure1 ) , to which we have applied our `` @xmath114-clipping '' criterion to discriminate , in a statistical way , the stars belonging to the cluster from field objects ( see de marchi & paresce 1995 for a detailed description of the method ) .",
    "the lf of ms stars determined in this way agrees reasonably well with that measured by mould et al .",
    ", in that both lf increase with decreasing luminosity up to a peak at @xmath115 and then fall off .",
    "theirs , however , reveals a secondary peak at @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) that we do not see and which is most likely the result of a different amount of correction for field star contamination .",
    "we would like to point out that the latter represents the largest source of uncertainty in the determination of the lf in field f3 , and that this effect is much more severe than that made by ignoring the photometric incompleteness as both mould et al .",
    "and we have done .",
    "the resulting lf is shown in figure5 after having been converted into units of absolute magnitude by adopting the distance modulus given above .",
    "we have employed the multi - mass michie - king models developed by meylan ( 1987 , 1988 ) , and which were later adopted by meylan & mayor ( 1991 ) to study the dynamical properties of ngc6397 .",
    "each model is characterized by an imf in the form of an exponential @xmath118 , with a variable exponent @xmath94 , and by four structural parameters describing respectively the scale radius ( @xmath119 ) , the scale velocity ( @xmath120 ) , the central value of the dimensionless gravitational potential @xmath121 , and the anisotropy radius ( @xmath122 ) . from the parameter space defined in this way ,",
    "meylan & mayor ( 1991 ) have selected those models that simultaneously fit both the observed surface brightness ( sbp ) and velocity dispersion ( vdp ) profiles of the cluster .",
    "the fit to the sbp and vdp , however , can only constrain @xmath123 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath124 while still allowing the imf to take on a variety of shapes . to break this degeneracy ,",
    "we have complemented meylan s code by imposing the condition that the model mf agree with the observed lf , following precisely the approach that we used in our investigation of the globular cluster m4 ( pulone , de  marchi , & paresce 1999 ) .    as we explain in that paper , michie - king modeling only provides a `` snapshot '' of the current dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "it is , then , useful to define the global mass function ( gmf ) , i.e.the mass distribution of all cluster stars at present , as the mf that the cluster would have simply as a result of stellar evolution ( i.e. ignoring any local modifications induced by internal dynamics and/or the interaction with the galactic tidal field ) .",
    "clearly , in this case the imf and gmf of ms ( un - evolved ) stars is the same . for practical purposes",
    ", the gmf has been divided into sixteen different mass classes , covering ms stars , white dwarfs , and heavy remnants , precisely as described in pulone et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "the sbp and vdp used in our simulations are taken from the paper of meylan & mayor ( 1991 ) , as g. meylan kindly gave us the data in electronic form . since these authors provide the mass , density , and structural parameters of the 8 models that best reproduce the observed radial profiles ( sbp and vdp ) , we have tested whether the predicted lf would also agree with our observations .",
    "our exercise confirms what we have already shown in figure4 : as long as a single value of the exponent @xmath94 is used for the imf over the mass range @xmath125 , none of these 8 models gives local mf that , converted into lf using the m - l relation described above , agree with our data .",
    "in fact , if the exponent @xmath94 is selected in such a way that the rising portion of the lf is well fitted ( this requires @xmath126 ) , the model lf consistently deviate from the observations beyond the peak at @xmath10 , @xmath127 because they fall off too slowly . similarly , to fit the falling portion of the lf",
    "one would require @xmath128 , which would in turn overestimate the number of bright stars .",
    "on the other hand , if the model imf is allowed to flatten out below @xmath16 , both portions of the three observed lf can simultaneously be fitted while , at the same time , the sbp and vdp are adequately reproduced .",
    "in particular , we find that an exponential imf with index @xmath129 for evolved stars ( @xmath130 ) , @xmath131 in the range @xmath132and which drops with @xmath133 at lower masses would not only produce a good fit to the lf observed in field f1 , f2 , and f3 ( figure5 ) , but would also give reasonable values for the cluster s structural parameters : the concentration ratio ( @xmath134 ) , the total cluster mass ( @xmath135 ) , the fraction of heavy remnants ( @xmath136 in mass , about half of which in the form of neutron stars of @xmath137and the rest in the form of heavy white dwarfs of @xmath138 ) , and the anisotropy radius ( @xmath139 ) are all in excellent agreement with those of the 8 best models of meylan & mayor ( 1991 ) .    king et al .",
    "( 1998 ) notice that the somewhat large value of the core radius that meylan & mayor ( 1991 ) obtain ( and that we only marginally decrease here ) does not allow them to accurately reproduce the sbp in the innermost regions of the cluster . on the other hand ,",
    "meylan & mayor point out that the deviation of the observed profile from that of a typical michie - king model in the central regions is most likely the result of random fluctuations due to a few bright stars , whose distribution is not uniform ( aurire , lauzeral , & ortolani 1990 ) .",
    "moreover , if the core of ngc6397 has already been through its collapse phase , a classical king - type profile ( king 1962 ) of a cluster in equilibrium certainly does not provide the most appropriate representation of the sbp and the value of @xmath123 that one would deduce from it would be rather uncertain .    to test whether our model also gives a proper account of the properties of the stellar population in the core , we have compared the mf that it predicts at @xmath140from the center with that measured by king et al . ( 1995 ) with the foc on board hst . although our model seems to predict a somewhat slower decline than that reported by king et al . in the range",
    "@xmath141(namely @xmath142 vs. their @xmath143 ) , this discrepancy should not be taken too seriously in view of the limitations of our model and of the uncertainties that could affect the conversion of the observed lf from the f480lp band of the foc into the johnson s v band , and then from that into the f814w band of the wfpc2 and , finally , into a mf by the use of a rather crude m - l relation .",
    "we can , therefore , conclude that the two mf are in fairly reasonable agreement with each other , in that they both indicate an inverted function ( i.e. stars are decreasing with decreasing mass ) starting already at the turn - off .",
    "the result stemming from figure5 and from the discussion above is fully consistent with our findings in section3 . _ not only",
    "can we exclude that the local mf measured near the half - light radius come from a single exponent power - law , but we also prove here that not even the global mf from which they originated through energy equipartition can be a function of that type_. these findings carry the important implication that , if ngc6397 has not experienced too strong an interaction with the galactic tidal field or bulge ( but see gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) , also the imf has to flatten out and , possibly , drop below @xmath16 .",
    "since , however , nature has always shown a predilection for smooth variations , it might seem rather unphysical that the imf or gmf of ms stars can have such an abrupt change of slope at @xmath16as our work seems to imply .",
    "clearly , our fit to the gmf is nothing but a mathematical over - simplification , dictated by the adoption of a power - law as representative of the distribution of stellar masses . as scalo ( 1998 ) points out , this assumption might be correct for intermediate mass stars , but fails at the edges of the distribution ( very low and very high masses ) .",
    "although we could have used more than two values of the exponent @xmath94 to fit the change of slope , that would have appeared as an unwarranted sophistication whose physical meaning remains uncertain .",
    "thus , since the most important implication of figures4 and 5 is that the mf of ngc6397 can not be reproduced using a single exponent power - law distribution , one wonders why choosing two or more power - laws would make any sense at all .",
    "there is , however , a large amount of theoretical work suggesting that the star formation process would preferentially give rise to a mass distribution that deviates from a pure power - law .",
    "zinnecker ( 1984 ) and , more recently , adams & fatuzzo ( 1996 ) have pointed out that , if the number of parameters governing the fragmentation process of proto - stellar clouds is sufficiently large ( of order 5 or more ) , the central - limit theorem immediately implies that the imf should take on a log - normal form .",
    "a similar imf is obtained independently by elmegreen ( 1997 , 1999 ) with a different theoretical approach .",
    "if we adopt the formalism of adams & fatuzzo ( 1996 ) , the imf is characterized by two parameters , namely the characteristic mass @xmath144 and the standard deviation @xmath145 and takes on the form :    @xmath146 ^ 2 } { 2 \\sigma^2 } \\ ] ]    where @xmath147 is a normalization constant .",
    "the miller & scalo ( 1979 ) imf ( now superseded ; scalo 1998 ) would require @xmath148and @xmath149 , while the scalo ( 1986 ) imf ( now also extinct ; scalo 1998 ) would imply both a larger value of @xmath150 and a smaller width @xmath145 . in figure6",
    "we show that , within the observational uncertainties , the gmf of ngc6397 is consistent with a log - normal distribution having @xmath151and @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly , these values are very similar to those found for ms stars in the pleiades ( bouvier et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * the properties of the stellar population of ngc6397 as determined with deep ir observations obtained with nicmos on board the hst are fully consistent with those stemming from similarly deep wfpc2 optical data . in particular , down to the bottom of the cluster s ms , nicmos does not show any more faint , red objects than those already detected by the wfpc2 , thus confirming that there are no stars contributing significantly to the low - mass budget of the cluster which can be detected in the ir and not in the @xmath1 band .",
    "thus , the unavailability of nicmos will not hinder this investigation in the future . *",
    "a comparison of our deep ir cmd with the theoretical models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows the agreement to be excellent , thus proving that the latter are reliable also in the ir domain . *",
    "the ir lf of ms stars near the cluster s half - light radius , measured using a comparison field located a few degrees away from the cluster center to correct for the contamination due to foreground and background objects , is fully consistent with those obtained with the wfpc2 in the @xmath1 band using different and independent techniques to separate cluster members from field stars , namely the color selection of paresce et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the proper motion study of king et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . *",
    "using the m - l relations of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , all three lf translate into mf in which the number of objects per unit mass increases exponentially as @xmath152 in the range @xmath153and then flattens out and drops .",
    "we show that a simple power - law distribution of the form @xmath154 can not reproduce any of these lf if the exponent @xmath94 is kept constant , regardless of its value . * the relaxation mechanism and the ensuing mass segregation process inside the cluster is studied under the assumption that a simple isothermal model of a cluster in equilibrium is a viable choice for ngc6397 and ignoring the effects of tidal stripping due to the galaxy , as they do not seem to play any significant role in reshaping the mf of this cluster ( paresce & de marchi 1999 ) .",
    "the model can accurately and simultaneously reproduce the lf observed in regions located @xmath6 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 away from the center , the inverted lf in the core , as well as the sbp and vdp of red giant stars only if the imf rises as @xmath155 in the range @xmath20and then drops as @xmath156 below @xmath107 .",
    "the error bands associated with the quoted exponents assume that the m - l relations of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are not affected by statistical uncertainties . *",
    "the imf that we obtain is fully consistent with a log - normal distribution peaked at @xmath157and with standard deviation @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we show that a robust and reliable determination of the imf of gc requires the effects of dynamical evolution to be taken into proper account .",
    "although we have used the best lf currently available for ngc6397 , we are still forced to rely on uncertain brightness and velocity dispersion radial profiles and on very simple michie  king multi - mass quasi - equilibrium models to convert a locally determined present day mass function into a global mf .",
    "in fact , while the models that we have used are currently the state of the art , they work only under the strict condition that the cluster be fully relaxed and in dynamical equilibrium . episodes of core collapse and , especially , gravitational shocking due to repeated interactions with the bulge and disk of the galaxy , however , may profoundly disrupt this distribution by ejecting low mass stars from the core and by compressing the tidal boundary in phase space at each encounter ( see e.g. de marchi et al .",
    "until these effects can properly be accounted for in future models of this sort , we should obtain the global cluster mf directly by observation through a systematic , precise , and complete census of the entire stellar population of gc spanning a wide range of possible evolutionary scenarios .",
    "specifically , one needs to determine the exact shape of the cluster lf at many locations in the cluster from the main sequence turn - off down to at least the peak of the lf at @xmath107 .",
    "these local lf and the resulting global mf can then be compared to the available cluster models to assess their validity under differing circumstances .",
    "this project is within easy reach of a large telescope such as the vlt .",
    "we would like to thank georges meylan for providing us with the original code of his dynamical model and isabelle baraffe and gilles chabrier for many useful discussions .",
    "+ we are indebted to haldan cohn , the referee of this work , for his invaluable comments that have considerably strengthened our paper ."
