    "although abeles has already mentioned the idea of embedding multiple synfire chains in a local network , many of the studies on synfire chains use a homogeneously connected network  @xcite .",
    "one way to embed multiple synfire chains is to sum up the synaptic connections of synfire chains like an associative memory network .",
    "even if each synfire chain consists of homogeneous connections , the connections summed them up are inhomogeneous .",
    "the ability to generate synchronous spikes in homogeneous network has been enthusiastically studied , but that in inhomogeneous network have not been throughly investigated . here",
    "we embed the chains in the way of associative memory .",

    "we have previously reported the activity of a network in which the half of neurons join in each memory pattern  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze sparsely and densely connected networks and discuss the difference of ability to generate synchronous spikes among those networks .",
    "the sparsely connected networks of the associative memory constructed by the binary neurons have been intensively researched  @xcite .",

    "section [ sec_cap ] is devoted for the memory capacity of the network .",
