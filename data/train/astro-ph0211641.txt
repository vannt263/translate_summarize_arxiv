    "qsos probe the universe at the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "their strong , broad emission lines arise predominantly from photoionization of high speed gas ( @xmath5 km  s@xmath2  to @xmath6 km  s@xmath2 ) at @xmath7 to @xmath6 gravitational radii from a supermassive black hole ( @xmath8 m@xmath9 ) .",
    "the emission line spectrum therefore promises to reveal the accretion mechanism , the origin of the fuel , and links with the host galaxy evolution .",
    "in addition , baldwin ( 1977 ) discovered a relationship between line equivalent width and luminosity , suggesting that the luminosity may be determined directly from the spectrum , hence providing an important test of cosmological models at high redshift , @xmath10 .",
    "forty years after qsos discovery , these promises have yet to be fulfilled .",
    "there are two main , related , reasons for this .",
    "( i ) even in the nearby lower - luminosity agn , the broad line region ( blr ) remains unresolved and its structure can be inferred only indirectly .",
    "for example , reverberation mapping has shown that light - travel times from the central continuum source increase with decreasing ionization ( from a few light days , to light months , e.g. , netzer & peterson 1997 ) .",
    "emission line strengths and the fact that absorption along the line - of - sight to the continuum source occurs only sometimes , show that only a few percent of the center is covered by blr gas , and the global filling factor is very small .",
    "( ii ) to first order , emission - line ratios of all uv - optically selected qsos are surprisingly similar .",
    "@xcite successfully reproduced the average qso spectrum  showing that their similarity was the result of powerful selection .",
    "given a blr with a wide range of gas density , column density and ionizing flux , different emission lines are formed predominantly in gas with different physical conditions optimal for their formation .",
    "thus the integrated line properties of the blr spectrum are quite insensitive to the density , ionization , and column density of blr gas .",
    "this is true of any blr model that exhibits a range of density at each radius ; thus the integrated properties of the blr can not clearly distinguish among multi - cloud models @xcite , disk - wind models @xcite , stellar wind , or bloated stellar atmosphere models ( e.g. , scoville & norman 1988 ; alexander & netzer 1994 ) .",
    "in important details , however , spectra of qsos are not all similar . rather than comparing models with average line profiles and line ratios",
    ", we can learn more from direct observations of the dependence of qso spectra on observed parameters that may be related directly to the central engine .",
    "these dependences , including velocity information across the broad line profiles , provide a powerful tool that has yet to be fully exploited .",
    "two striking sets of relationships have been found , relating qsos optical  uv emission lines and soft x - ray continua with fundamental properties of the central engine .",
    "one is the baldwin relationship between equivalent widths of emission lines from the blr , and the luminous power output , l. the other set is the `` principal component 1 '' ( also called `` eigenvector 1 '' ) relationships , which appear to be related to the eddington ratio .",
    "these relationships may allow us to explore the accretion history of qsos and , ultimately , the formation of galaxy spheroids .",
    "the baldwin effect is an inverse relationship between the equivalent widths of qsos broad emission lines ew , and the uv continuum luminosity l , ew @xmath11 l@xmath12 , spanning 7 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "it was originally derived using the civ@xmath31549  line @xcite , and the continuum luminosity at 1549 .",
    "other lines show baldwin relationships ( e.g. , kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 , espey & andreadis 1999 ) , with @xmath4 = @xmath13 to @xmath14 , the slope apparently increasing with increasing ionization potential .",
    "the `` line cores '' ( emission from low velocity gas ) contribute more than the line wings ( francis et al .",
    "hereinafter , fhfc ; osmer , porter , & green 1994 ; francis & koratkar 1995 ; brotherton & francis 1999 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the baldwin effect results from a luminosity - dependent spectral energy distribution , ionization parameter , covering factor , or is the result of inclination @xcite .",
    "the original hope was that qso luminosity could be determined from line equivalent widths , and that the resulting l  @xmath10 relationship could be used to discriminate among cosmological models .",
    "however , so far , observed baldwin relationships show too much scatter .    in a principal component analysis ( pca ) of direct , integrated , line measurements in the h@xmath4  region of 87 low @xmath10 qsos , boroson & green ( 1992 , hereinafter , bg92 ) discovered that most of the spectrum - to - spectrum variance , represented by the first principal component ( eigenvector 1 , hereinafter , bgpc1 ) , links a number of variables : decreasing broad h@xmath4  line width corresponds to stronger feii  optical emission ( feii(opt ) ) , weaker [ oiii]@xmath35007  emission , and increasing h@xmath4  asymmetry from stronger red to stronger blue wings .",
    "bg92 suggested that the feii(opt )  [ oiii ]  anticorrelation arose from an increase in covering factor of dense feii - emitting gas , resulting in an increase in the eddington accretion ratio .",
    "the case for higher eddington ratios was especially supported by the laor et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 , hereinafter , l94 , l97 ) inclusion of x - ray spectral index @xmath15 in this principal component : steeper @xmath15 corresponds to narrower h@xmath4 etc . in a virial interpretation of h@xmath4  width ,",
    "narrower h@xmath4  would correspond to smaller black - hole mass , hence higher eddington ratio ; steeper @xmath15 corresponds to higher eddington ratios as inferred for galactic black hole candidates @xcite . also using a pca on integrated line measurements",
    ", @xcite showed that these relationships extend to the uv : stronger feii(opt ) corresponds to a larger ratio siiii]@xmath31892/ciii]@xmath31909  indicating higher densities , also weaker civ@xmath31549 , stronger nv@xmath31240 , stronger siiv+oiv]@xmath31400  feature , and other properties .",
    "the support for a virial interpretation of h@xmath4  line widths has further strengthened the case for an eddington ratio interpretation of these bgpc1 relationships ( boroson 2002 , hereinafter , b02 )    the discovery of supermassive black holes in nearby massive galaxies @xcite and the proportionality between m@xmath16 and spheroid masses @xcite has allowed the calibration of virial masses in nearby qsos and active galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the velocity width of the broad h@xmath4  emission line , and a nuclear distance for the h@xmath4-emitting gas derived from reverberation mapping or photoionization modeling @xcite , allow the measurement of m@xmath16 , hence the calculation of the maximum ( eddington ) accretion luminosity , l@xmath17 , and the eddington accretion ratio , l / l@xmath18 . comparison of the space density of local black holes with that of qsos at the peak of their luminous output near @xmath19 2  3 , shows that nearby galaxies harbor the black - hole relics of qso activity ( e.g. , marconi & salvati 2002 ; fabian 1999 ; gilli , salvati , & hasinger 2001 ) .",
    "together with the m@xmath16  spheroid mass relationship",
    "this then points to an interrelated evolutionary history for qsos and massive galaxies ( e.g. , fabian 1999 ; silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "thus an understanding of the above principal component relationships is important for understanding galaxy evolution .    in this paper",
    "we extend the above analyses , carrying out a spectral principal component analysis ( spca ) on the essentially complete sample of optical - uv spectra of 22 qsos , the same sample that we used for the pca on integrated line measurements described above .",
    "we briefly describe the sample , observations and reductions in  [ obs ] . in  [ spca ]",
    "we describe the technique of spectral pca .",
    "the results of the spca are presented in  [ results ] .",
    "we first reproduce the main results of the bg92 pca to illustrate the power of spca .",
    "the principal component spectra covering the ly@xmath0  to h@xmath0  region give a striking visual impression of the relationships among optical and uv emission lines of different ionization stage and critical density .",
    "such broad band coverage is essential for investigating relationships involving broad - band features such as the entire optical - uv spectral energy distribution , the balmer continuum and the blended feii(uv ) emission ( `` small blue bump '' ) .",
    "we include some spca simulations to illustrate the non - linear effects of line profile relationships . in  [ disc ]",
    "we discuss the distinctness and separation of the emission - line spectral components , and the interpretation of the `` intermediate line region '' and `` very broad line region '' as presented by francis , brotherton , and collaborators .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ summ ] , mentioning some implications for future research , in particular , the usefulness of spca for reducing scatter in baldwin relationships , and in tracking the evolution of eddington ratios in qsos .",
    "complementary analyses for our qso sample , including results of pca on direct , integrated , parameters , have been presented by @xcite , @xcite , wills et al .",
    "( 1999b , c ) , & @xcite .",
    "we have observed optical - uv spectra for 22 of the 23 pg qsos making up the complete optically selected sample investigated by l94 and l97 .",
    "laor et al .",
    "selected all qsos from the bright quasar survey ( bqs ) @xcite with redshift @xmath20 and a galactic hydrogen column density n@xmath21@xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "this sample should be representative of low - redshift , optically selected qsos , but subject to the same incompleteness as the bqs @xcite .",
    "the qsos in the sample are listed in table 1 along with their redshifts , magnitudes , and other parameters .",
    "the low redshift ensures observational access to the soft x - rays nearest the wavelength of the ionizing continuum . the low galactic absorption and brightness of this low redshift sample enable accurate determination of the intrinsic soft x - ray and uv spectra .",
    "in addition the low redshift and uv coverage allows investigation of the ly@xmath0  region , with much reduced confusion from intergalactic absorption lines .    for the ultraviolet region",
    ", we obtained _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) faint object spectrograph ( fos ) spectrophotometry for 16 qsos and used archival fos data for 6 qsos , covering wavelengths from below ly@xmath0  to beyond the atmospheric cutoff near 3200  in the observed frame  red wing . ] .",
    "instrumental resolution is equivalent to @xmath1230 km  s@xmath2  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the fos pipeline calibration is described at http://www.stecf.org/poa/fos/index.html .",
    "optical data were obtained at mcdonald observatory , generally with the large cassegrain spectrograph on the harlan j. smith 2.7 m telescope , supplemented by some from the hst fos .",
    "we were usually able to get quasi - simultaneous optical observations , within a month of the new hst observations , to reduce the uncertainty caused by qso intrinsic variability .",
    "observations were made through narrow ( 1 2 ) and wide ( 8) slits .",
    "standard stars were observed several times each night .",
    "they were chosen from the spectral standard stars for hst calibration @xcite to ensure consistent calibration between uv and optical data .",
    "usually 23 spectra for each object are required to cover wavelength ranges from below 3200  to beyond h@xmath0 .",
    "instrumental resolution for the optical spectra is @xmath17  fwhm , equivalent to 450 km  s@xmath2  to @xmath1250 km  s@xmath2  ( fwhm ) in the h@xmath4  to h@xmath0  region .",
    "higher resolution spectra ( @xmath24 km  s@xmath2  fwhm ) of the feii(opt)h@xmath4[oiii ]  region were obtained with the same spectrograph and telescope at mcdonald observatory and are used only to determine the redshifts of most of the sample qsos with sufficiently strong [ oiii ]  lines .",
    "standard packages in iraf were used to reduce the data .",
    "wavelength calibration was done by using comparison spectra .",
    "for some spectra , it was necessary to shift the wavelength scale to match the wavelengths of night sky lines .",
    "spectrophotometric calibration was achieved by : 1 ) using standard star spectra to calibrate qso spectra to an absolute flux - density scale , 2 ) scaling the narrow slit qso spectra to match the shape and absolute flux - density level of the wide slit qso spectra .",

    "one of the advantages of spca is that correlations can be investigated without parameterizing the line profiles or defining the continua .",
    "in addition , unlike the `` composite spectrum analysis '' which shows average qso properties , the spca analysis keeps the information for individual qsos , e.g. , the weights of the principal component spectra for each qso ( table  [ sample ] ) . the original ( normalized ) spectra in the sample can therefore be reconstructed by adding the weighted principal component spectra to the mean spectrum .",

    "much of the remaining intrinsic variance is likely to arise from departures from linearity  among the baldwin and line - width relationships for different emission lines , in the description of the continuum - to - continuum differences  and from time - variability .",
    "@xcite showed that , for seyfert galaxies , there is a relationship between line and continuum luminosity , as an individual seyfert nucleus varies in time .",

    "our small sample , with a limited range in l , does not allow us to distinguish whether the line - width components are related to black hole mass , m@xmath71 , or to eddington accretion ratio , l / l@xmath72 ( table  [ corr ] ) .",
    "however , the dependence of the spc3 weights on @xmath70 , suggests , by analogy with galactic black - hole candidates , that this component is driven by eddington accretion ratio ( l94 , l97 , yuan et al .",
    "stronger ew feii(opt ) , feii(opt)/feii(uv ) , and the feii(opt )  [ oiii ]  anticorrelation indicate that more dense gas is available to fuel the central engine .",
    "stronger feii(opt ) is associated with narrower fwhm(h@xmath4 ) , consistent with an eddington ratio interpretation of spc3 .",
    "further support for a physical difference between spc1 and spc3 gas is indicated by line - intensity ratios : @xcite showed that the emission - line ratios for gas of low- and high - velocity dispersion indicate different photoionizing flux , ionization state , and density .",
    "the near - absence of emission in spc1 from gas with high - velocity dispersion , and the luminosity independence of spc3 , suggest that the line emission represented by spc3 has ew @xmath1 constant .",
    "could the global baldwin relationship be explained by a very simple model in which a total line equivalent width is the sum of the equivalent width of the line - width component ( @xmath1 constant ) , and that of the line - core component ( @xmath11 l@xmath73 ) , i.e. , ew(total ) = @xmath74 ?",
    "such a dependence can fit our own data , but can not fit the baldwin effect data for large samples , such as that of @xcite , covering seven orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "since the relationships represented by the line - core and line - width spectral principal components have real , independent , physical origins , it would be appropriate to model these relationships independently rather than , as in the past , trying to model the observed integrated equivalent widths ( e.g. , korista et al . 1998 ; kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "a case in point may be attempts to ascribe an ionization - potential dependence to @xmath4 , the exponent of the baldwin relationship .",
    "the _ relative _ values of @xmath4 are quite accurately determined for different emission lines , but the scatter is large ( fig .",
    "[ slopes ] ) . the large scatter may be attributed to the use of integrated ews with a significant contribution from non - core emission because the non - core line ratios are independent of those in spc1 gas .",
    "one possibility is to perform a spca on a sample of simulated model spectra , making a comparison of the resulting spc spectra with those from a spca of the observed spectra .",
    "another approach might be to use the principal component spectra to derive separate spectra for the ( assumed separate ) gas components responsible for the line - core and line - width components , and compare each of these with photoionization models .",
    "this was attempted by @xcite who decomposed uv emission lines into components representing intermediate and very broad line regions ( ilr and vblr ) .",
    "our spca shows that their vblr is an over - simplification .",
    "while their ilr is similar to our spc1 component , we do not define a vblr , but rather a line - width component ( dominated by our spc3 ) , where line widths range from the narrowest to broadest h@xmath4  lines observed ( fwhm from 1500 to 9500 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "thus the ilr derived by @xcite would include spc1 emission as well as low - velocity emission from the line - width component",
    ". however , the technique of best - fitting a combination of line - core and line - width spectra still seems promising .",
    "further discussion is beyond the scope of the present paper .    while the ilr has been directly related to the baldwin effect ( brotherton et al .",
    "1994a , fhfc , francis & koratkar 1995 ) , the relationship of the uv ilr to the optical bgpc1 has been controversial , including the question of whether bgpc1 is part of the baldwin relationship , or whether it is the cause of its enormous scatter @xcite .",
    "because of our wide wavelength coverage we have been able to demonstrate clearly that these two sets of relationships are orthogonal .",
    "@xcite came to a different conclusion , based on their finding of increasing ilr strength with [ oiii]@xmath35007 , a strong spc3 or bgpc1 parameter .",
    "this may be because of the ilr decomposition problem mentioned above .",
    "our spectral principal component analysis of an essentially complete sample of 22 pg qsos yielded three significant linear spectral principal components accounting for @xmath178% of the intrinsic variance among emission - line and continuum spectra over the wavelength range from ly@xmath0  to h@xmath0  ( excluding the three qsos with strong intrinsic absorption and the extreme object pg1202 + 281 ) .",
    "spectral principal component 1 dominates the uv emission lines , accounts for @xmath141% of the intrinsic spectrum - to - spectrum variance , and is identified with the baldwin relationships .",
    "spectral principal component 2 accounts for most of the continuum variations , contributing @xmath123% of the total intrinsic variance .",
    "spectral principal component 3 is directly related to the first principal component in the pca of integrated line measurements in the feii ",
    "h@xmath4[oiii ]  region by bg92 .",
    "it includes line - width , which introduces non - linear relationships among flux bins across emission lines , and therefore propagates to higher - order principal components in our linear analysis .",
    "this line - width component dominates the feii ",
    "h@xmath4[oiii ]  region , and accounts for between 14% and 31% of the sample s total intrinsic variance",
    ". tables  [ pcfrac ] and [ pcid ] summarize these results .      1 .   spc1 is dominated by emission from gas of low velocity dispersion ( fwhm 2000  3000 km  s@xmath2 ) , but also includes broad heii@xmath34686  ( fwhm 4880 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "2 .   the weights of this principal component correlate with the qsos luminosities .",
    "3 .   deriving the equivalent widths from this principal component leads to a baldwin relationship in good agreement with the slope and normalization determined for much larger samples and luminosity ranges spanning 7 orders of magnitude .",
    "4 .   the narrow ( fwhm 2000  3000 km  s@xmath2 ) features in our spectral principal component 1 agree in profile and line intensity ratios with those derived from spca for much larger lbqs samples using just uv spectra from ly@xmath0  to the ciii ]  blend ( principal component 1 , from francis et al .",
    "1992 ; francis & koratkar 1995 ) , and inferred by comparison of mean uv spectra of low and high luminosity qsos @xcite , and of low and high x - ray brightness qsos divided by @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed quantitative agreement with the baldwin effect , for their large , but low signal - to - noise ratio sample .",
    "the strong , broad heii@xmath34686  links our spc1 directly with the `` luminosity '' principal component derived by bg92 and b02 from direct measurements .",
    "the baldwin relation determined from direct equivalent width measurements would not be expected to be very significant for a sample the size of ours and covering only 2 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "however we demonstrate a significant reduction in scatter using spca - derived ews , over those measured directly .",
    "the line - width components contribute most of the scatter in the baldwin relationships .",
    "this demonstrates the potential of spca - derived ews to define a much cleaner baldwin relation for future investigations of emission line response to the ionizing continuum , perhaps with applications to cosmology ( relations between luminosity distance and redshift ) .",
    "we have determined the baldwin relationships for different emission lines , confirming that the effect is present for the balmer lines .",
    "uv and optical feii  emission - line blends are very weak or absent from our `` baldwin effect '' principal component .",
    "our clean separation of ly@xmath0  and nv  in spc1 shows a significant baldwin effect for nv .",
    "this result is in striking contrast with the slope derived from direct measurements , where the ew shows a positive slope ( increases ) with luminosity .      1 .",
    "we have demonstrated clearly that the third principal component is directly related to bg92 s first principal component .",
    "the spc3 weights are shown to directly correlate with fwhm(h@xmath4 ) and with @xmath70 , parameters that are important in bgpc1 correlations in the h@xmath4  region ( bg92 and l94 , l97 ) .",
    "2 .   we present a number of emission line correlations , both positive and negative .",
    "of particular note is a clear anticorrelation between optical and uv feii  blends , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "3 .   @xcite , and @xcite have demonstrated a calibration of black hole mass in terms of fwhm h@xmath4  and luminosity , as if h@xmath4  line width is determined by virial motions .",
    "the line - width correlations demonstrated by this component , between balmer lines and mgii , and fwhm ciii ]  has also been shown to correlate with h@xmath4  @xcite , suggesting that this calibration can be used to investigate black - hole mass relationships at higher redshifts ( @xmath10 .5ex2  3.5 ) , where mgii  and ciii ]  are accessible to ground - based spectroscopy ( see also mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .      we have demonstrated the power of our wide wavelength coverage combined with spca to link two independently - discovered luminosity relationships at high and low redshift , showing that the bg92 and b02 luminosity principal component of low redshift samples is directly related to the baldwin effect in higher redshift , uv spectra , and showing that bgpc1 ( or the line - width principal component ) relationships are the cause of enormous scatter in baldwin relationships derived from integrated , direct , ew measurements .",
    "we show how baldwin relationships can be derived using spca , virtually eliminating the scatter .",
    "such spectrum - luminosity relationships might be used to determine @xmath10-independent luminosities , hence to derive l-@xmath10 relationship at high @xmath10 .",
    "this rekindles the hope that baldwin relationships can be used for cosmology .",
    "the line - width principal components are related to black - hole mass or eddington accretion ratio , and their clean separation from the baldwin relationships can , in principle , lead to their use to trace qso evolution . the wide wavelength coverage and spca",
