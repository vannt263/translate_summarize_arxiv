    "graphs and trees , labeled by various kinds of integral data , make numerous appearances across mathematics and its applications , in this note we will discuss instances from algebraic geometry , conformal field theory , representation theory , and mathematical biology . along the way we will see how these instances are related by the same type of geometric structure : a flat family of algebras over the moduli of curves .",
    "a natural example of a family of algebras of labeled trees is the class of deformations of the plcker embedding of the grassmannian of @xmath1-planes @xmath2 parametrized by the tropical grassmannian @xmath3 introduced by speyer and sturmfels in @xcite .",
    "the toric members of this family have a very nice description as the affine semigroup algebras of the cones @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a finite trivalent tree with @xmath6 ordered leaves .",
    "the cone @xmath7 is the set of weightings of the edges of @xmath5 by nonnegative real numbers , such that the triangle inequalities are satisfied for the the three weights incident on any internal vertex of @xmath8 the lattice of integral points in this cone is taken to be integer weightings of @xmath5 such that the sum of the weights about any internal vertex is even .",
    "a similar family of semigroup algebras was constructed by buczynska and wiesniewski in @xcite as an algebraic analogue to the jukes - cantor statistical model of phylogenetics .",
    "these models are parametrized by the same class of trees @xmath9 and aid in the study of ancestral relationships between a set of @xmath6-taxa .",
    "the polytopes @xmath10 ( author s notation ) of buczynska and wiesniewski are defined as the set of weightings of the tree @xmath5 with the same conditions and lattice as @xmath7 , along with the additional condition that the sum of the weights about each internal vertex is equal to @xmath11 this polytope is compact , and so defines a projective toric variety .",
    "buczynska and wiesniewski were able to show that the graded algebras @xmath12 $ ] are deformation equivalent , and therefore share the same hilbert function .",
    "their visually appealing method was to construct pair - wise deformations between algebras associated to topologically similar trees , those related by a so - called flip - move .",
    "buczynksa and wiesniewski conjectured the existence of a global algebra that would have one toric deformation for each tree @xmath5 to @xmath12,$ ] and serve in the same role as the plcker algebra serves for the family @xmath13.$ ] this conjecture was answered by sturmfels and xu in @xcite , where they showed that the cox - nagata ring @xmath14 of the blow - up @xmath15 of @xmath16 at @xmath6 generically positioned points has precisely these properties . in this same paper , sturmfels and",
    "xu drew attention to the work of bauer , @xcite who showed that the moduli space of quasiparabolic rank 2 semistable bundles on the @xmath6-punctured projective line @xmath17 is connected to @xmath15 be a series of flops .",
    "this moduli space caries line bundles @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an @xmath20 tuple of nonnegative integers .",
    "the global sections @xmath21 is known as the space of non - abelian theta functions , and its dimension is computed by the celebrated verlinde formula from mathematical physics , for the case where the symmetries are given by @xmath22 birational flops preserve the picard group and the cox ring , and so ensure that the phylogenetic hilbert functions of buczynska and wiesniewski can also be computed by the verlinde formula .",
    "this intriguing connection was the starting point for this project , it suggests that the combinatorial structures related to the verlinde formula , the `` factorization rules , '' have a geometric underpinning . in this paper",
    "we interpret the factorization rules in terms of deformation relations among graded rings attached to moduli of principal bundles .",
    "we will also extend this structure for all genus and all simple lie algebras @xmath23 over @xmath24 .",
    "the `` geometric factorization rules '' constructed here give a way to recursively study linear series on moduli of principle bundles , in particular for @xmath25 we obtain toric deformations of the moduli of semistable bundles .",
    "this will also allow us to answer a conjecture of millson @xcite on the relationship between linear series on the moduli of bundles for @xmath25 and linear series on weight varieties of the grassmannian variety of @xmath1-planes .",
    "generalizing to arbitrary genus for @xmath25 also extends the result of sturmfels and xu to varieties which define a generalization of the statistical models of buzcynska and wiesniewski to equivalent varieties for `` phylogenetic networks , '' graphs with positive first betti number , studied by buczynska in @xcite",
    ".      we will begin by describing the genus @xmath26 @xmath27 variant of our ideas and build up to the general case .",
    "the pairwise deformations of buczynska and wiesniewski along with the global deformation constructed by sturmfels and xu suggest an ambient deformation structured on a stratified space , with the combinatorics of the stratification coming from a `` space '' of trees .",
    "a natural stratified object from algebraic geometry which carries this combinatorial structure is @xmath28 the moduli stack of @xmath6-pointed stable curves of genus @xmath29 naively , we are looking for a flat sheaf of algebras on this stack , with the toric algebras from @xcite showing up as the fibers over the lowest strata .",
    "we would also like to incorporate the mathematical physics of the verlinde formula , which comes ready made with a graph - based combinatorial structure via the factorization rules .",
    "a natural candidate satisfying both conditions comes from the work of tsuchiya , ueno and yamada @xcite on conformal field theory , in the form of the locally free sheaf of conformal blocks @xmath30 on the moduli stack of stable @xmath6-punctured curves of genus @xmath29 here @xmath31 is an @xmath6-vector of dominant @xmath27 weights , and @xmath32 is a positive integer called the level .",
    "let @xmath33 be a smooth genus @xmath34 @xmath6-punctured curve , then there are isomorphisms of vector spaces which establish that the rank of the sheaf of conformal blocks is equal to the dimension of the space of generalized theta functions .",
    "@xmath35    tsuchiya , ueno , and yamada used this identification to prove the factorization rules for the verlinde formula by studying what happens as the curve @xmath33 is allowed to degenerate to a punctured stable curve .",
    "any such curve @xmath36 has a smooth normalization @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the doubled points of the normalization . in @xcite",
    "the following is proved    @xmath39    where @xmath40 if the associated puncture points are identified by the normalization .",
    "this is known as the factorization rule for conformal blocks with @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "when @xmath33 is stable of genus @xmath34 , its stable types fall into a finite number of equivalence classes , indexed by labeled trees @xmath8 each term in the sum on the right above then becomes a tensor product over the internal vertices of the tree @xmath8 the above isomorphism gives the following formula for dimensions .",
    "we will simplify to the case of two internal vertices , the reader can generalize the formula to larger trees .",
    "@xmath41    the reader may notice that formula [ fact ] is the counting formula of buczynska and wiesniewski from @xcite when all vertices of @xmath5 are trivalent .",
    "all of the constructions above work for any genus @xmath42 and any simple lie algebra @xmath43 this work was carried out in @xcite , but we refer the reader to the book by shimizu and ueno @xcite , the book by frenkel and ben - zwi @xcite , and the paper by looijenga @xcite for helpful discussion and other points of view . in what follows",
    "objects are fibered over the moduli stack of stable curves with @xmath6 punctures @xmath44 choose once and for all a weyl chamber @xmath45 and for the longest root @xmath46 let @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the corresponding coroot .",
    "let @xmath49 be the moduli stack of parabolic principal @xmath50-bundles on the punctured curve @xmath36 with parabolic structures @xmath51 at the puncture points , for @xmath52 with @xmath50 simply connected .",
    "these stacks carry line bundles @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a vector of dominant @xmath23-weights , and @xmath32 is a non - negative integer . for a punctured curve of genus @xmath42",
    "the verlinde formala calculates the dimension of the space of global sections of these line bundles with the following expression .",
    "@xmath55    here @xmath56 is the dual coxeter number of @xmath57 @xmath58 is the half sum of the positive roots , @xmath59 is a character associated to the tensor product of irreducible representations @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the cardinality of a certain subgroup of a maximal torus of @xmath62 this impressive expression hides the deeper symmetry of the verlinde formula given by the factorization rules , which allow one to calculate the formula for any genus and number of punctures with expressions like equation [ fact ] .",
    "in fact , the above equation can be derived from the factorization rules once one understands the characters of an associated combinatorial structure called the fusion algebra , see the second half of beauville s paper @xcite for details on this beautiful calculation .    in their proof of the factorization rules , tsuchiya ,",
    "ueno and yamada constructed , for any tuple @xmath54 of dominant weights , and any non - negative integer @xmath32 ( still called the level ) , a coherent , locally free sheaf @xmath63 with a projectively flat connection on @xmath44 the sheaf of conformal blocks geometrically ties together spaces of partition functions for the wzw model of conformal field theory as the complex curve @xmath36 varies .",
    "a different proof of the factorization rules was obtained by faltings in @xcite .",
    "various authors @xcite , @xcite , have shown that for a point @xmath64 there is an isomorphism of vector spaces    @xmath65    conformal blocks have generated much interest , due in part to their relationship with the moduli of principal bundles @xmath66 they have also been useful in the representation theory of kac - moody algebras and quantum groups , and have served as a source of examples for the theory of modular tensor categories , see @xcite .",
    "in addition , conformal blocks have a @xmath67-module structure which have made them objects of interest in the geometric langlands program .",
    "conformal blocks are not unique to nice categories of lie algebras , they can also be constructed from the representation theory of chiral vertex operator algebras , @xcite .",
    "as combinatorial structures associated to conformal blocks have already made appearances in phylogenetic and combinatorial algebraic geometry , it is our hope that the constructions can be suitably generalized to these other cases to provide further sources of interesting combinatorics .",
    "our first order of business is to construct a global algebraic object which ties the algebras of each combinatorial type together .",
    "we do this with sheaves of conformal blocks .",

    "we can calculate the rank of the sheaves @xmath63 with the verlinde formula ,    @xmath70    there is one catch , we lack a `` factorization '' property on the ring structure .",
    "we desire this property in order to study the more complicated algebras attached to surfaces of higher genus with their smaller genus counterparts .",
    "we remedy this with the following theorem , first a definition .    [ cones ] let @xmath33 be a stable curve with punctures at @xmath71 and let @xmath37 be a normalization with new punctures @xmath72 fix a cartan subalgebra @xmath73 of @xmath23 , with dual @xmath74 consider the cone @xmath75 of linear functionals @xmath76 which satisfy @xmath77 for all negative roots .",

    "the corresponding polytope is discussed in @xcite and @xcite , for @xmath696 it is the simplex defined by the condition that the sum of any two weights be either @xmath34 or @xmath180 and the associated toric variety is @xmath697 since the general case is a torus invariant subalgebra of a tensor product of toric algebras , it is also toric . note that the same observation applies to the genus @xmath698 case . by the same reasoning these algebras of vacua",
    "are the semigroup algebras given by the semigroup of weighted trivalent graphs @xmath88 which obey the above conditions at each internal vertex and leaf .",
    "one can directly verify that the associated toric varieties are those discussed in 4.4 of the paper of hurtubise and jeffrey @xcite .",
    "the operation of taking invariants by the torus is the `` gluing '' construction of hurtubise and jeffrey , used in their study of the complex and symplectic geometry of moduli of framed parabolic bundles .",
    "we note that our work here allows one to obtain the verlinde formula as a count of lattice points in the moment polytope of the hurtubise - jeffrey toric moduli space .",

    "we do not know the relationship between these flat families and the flat families constructed here .",
    "the commutative algebra of the genus @xmath34 case was extensively studied by buczynska and wiesniewski in @xcite , and also in @xcite , in the former paper it was proved that the deformed algebra of vacua are generated in degree @xmath447 with quadratic relations .",
    "little is known about the general non - trival genus case , although some good results have been obtained by buczynska , @xcite , in particular a generating set for the genus @xmath447 case .",
    "for @xmath699 the algebras @xmath111 are gorenstein .",
    "these algebras are domains , so it suffices to prove they share the same hilbert function with a gorenstein domain . choosing a stable curve with the same genus and puncture information as @xmath700 with genus @xmath34 components , we reduce the problem to showing an affine semigroup algebra is gorenstein . this is the semigroup of lattice points in a cone @xmath701 for some trivalent graph @xmath91 the associated algebra is gorenstein if and only if the module defined by the lattice points in the interior of this cone is principal .",

    "<S> we construct a flat sheaf of algebras over the moduli stack of stable punctured curves with fiber over a given curve equal to the cox ring of the moduli of quasiparabolic principal bundles associated to a simple complex reductive group , also known as the algebra of conformal blocks . </S>",
    "<S> this construction generalizes the connection between the hilbert functions from phylogenetic algebraic geometry and the verlinde formula , as recently discovered by sturmfels and xu , gives phylogenetic varieties as gorenstein toric deformations of the universal torsor of the moduli of quasiparabolic @xmath0 principle bundles bundles over a curve , and answers a conjecture of millson . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the relationship between these algebras and classical branching algebras of the associated simply connected reductive group in the general case , and speculate on a recipe for toric deformations of moduli of semistable quasiparabolic principal bundles for more general groups . </S>"
