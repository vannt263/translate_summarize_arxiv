    "we consider the gross - pitaevskii equation for @xmath0 @xmath1 with the boundary condition @xmath2 this equation is a dynamical model for superfluids and bose - einstein condensates , and has been extensively studied , especially concerning traveling wave solutions of the form @xmath3 , and dynamics of vortices ( zeros of @xmath4 ) .",
    "see [ 210 , 1216 , 2025 , 27 , 28 ] and references therein .",
    "however we know very little about long - time dynamics of general solutions , for example about stability of vortices and traveling waves , or even of the constant solution @xmath5 .",
    "heuristically , the main difficulty is that small perturbations can continue to interact with the non - zero background @xmath6 , and so do not easily disperse and decay .",
    "thus we started in @xcite an investigation of large - time behavior of solutions @xmath7small \" as a first step toward understanding dispersive processes in this equation .",
    "the perturbation @xmath8 from the equilibrium satisfies the equation @xmath9 the conserved energy and charge are written respectively @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , unique global existence for the cauchy problem has been proved first in @xcite for @xmath13 , and later in @xcite for any finite energy solution .    in order to investigate dispersive properties of small solutions @xmath14 ,",
    "it is natural to linearize the equation around @xmath15 .",
    "the left hand side of can be made complex linear by the following change of variable : @xmath16 then the new function @xmath17 satisfies the equation @xmath18 the linear evolution @xmath19 is expected to approximate small perturbations from the equilibrium .",
    "we have proved in the previous paper @xcite that this is indeed the case if @xmath20 for small solutions @xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we turn to the physical dimensions @xmath22 , where the dispersion becomes much weaker .",
    "actually there exist traveling wave solutions with arbitrarily small energy for @xmath11 @xcite , so it seems unlikely that the same result holds as in @xmath20 .",
    "however , it is still possible that small solutions @xmath14 disperse in general if they are well localized in space at some time , since those traveling waves are spatially spread - out and do not belong to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "our theorems [ thm:3d ] , [ thm:2d ] show that at least there exist plenty of global dispersive solutions even for @xmath22 .",
    "since is rather complicated , it seems natural to compare it with a simpler nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) with the same nonlinearity : @xmath24 the scaling argument suggests that the quadratic nonlinear terms can be treated as a perturbation in @xmath25 only if @xmath26 .",
    "hence we are led to work in weighted spaces , which provides more decay in time .",
    "even with the optimal decay rate of the free evolution , the quadratic terms exhibit in general the critical decay order @xmath27 in @xmath28 if @xmath11 . for @xmath29",
    ", we can generally expect asymptotically free behavior for dispersive solutions .",
    "coming back to our equation , the operator @xmath30 has a singularity at 0 frequency @xmath31 similar to the wave equation , which is worse for time decay than the schrdinger equation .",
    "in addition , apparently contains a singularity due to @xmath32 in the nonlinearity .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that our equation is better than the nls , and in fact our argument for @xmath11 does not apply to the latter , which appears simpler at first glance .",
    "this is because has a special structure and thereby we can transform it to another equation with a derivative nonlinearity , in effect .",
    "we give the details of the transform in section [ ss : normal ] .    before stating our results , we review the known results on the nls for comparison .",
    "dispersive global solutions have been constructed for the quadratic nls in @xmath11 only in the following two cases :    1 .",

    "@xmath35 ^ 2 $ ] , ( @xmath36 ) , @xcite    in the first case , the asymptotic profile is modified from the free evolution by a phase factor which depends only on @xmath37 , while in the second case it is modified by the addition of a term with @xmath23 scaling concentration at @xmath31 .",
    "each argument depends essentially on the form of the modification , and so it seems difficult to combine these results to cover our @xmath38 .",
    "for example when @xmath39 , it is only known that there are no asymptotically free solutions in the @xmath23 sense with the natural decay property @xcite .    for @xmath29 , it is known @xcite that small initial data in certain weighted spaces lead to asymptotically free solutions in the above case [ case1 ] .",
