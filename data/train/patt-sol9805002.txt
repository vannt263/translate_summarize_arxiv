    "in recent years , we proposed a new car - following model `` optimal velocity model '' ( ovm ) based on a dynamical equation @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is time and @xmath2 is a position of the @xmath3-th car .",
    "cars are numbered so that the @xmath4-th car precedes the @xmath3-th car .",
    "the driver feels the headway @xmath5 and determines an optimal velocity @xmath6 .",
    "it is best to drive a car with the optimal velocity but in general a deviation exists between the optimal velocity and a real one .",
    "the driver responds to the deviation @xmath7 and diminishes it by giving an acceleration @xmath8 to the car .",
    "the coefficient @xmath9 expresses the sensitivity of the driver .",
    "we call the function @xmath10 `` optimal velocity function '' ( ovf ) . in previous papers ,",
    "we have shown how ovm can explain behaviors of traffic flow , for example , the transition from a free flow to a congested flow , a density - flow relationship , a kind of effective delay of car motion@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the prototype equation of motion of traditional car - following model is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant@xcite . in this model ,",
    "a driver is thought to react to the stimulus proportional to the relative velocity between the previous car and his own car .",
    "equation ( [ proto ] ) may be generalized by changing the constant @xmath12 to a function @xmath13 of headway .",
    "however these models have no physically interesting solution because such equation can be integrated easily and be reduced to following equation @xmath14 where @xmath10 is a function of headway and @xmath15 . in car - following models , therefore , the introduction of `` delay '' is necessary and plays an essential role to understand the traffic dynamics @xcite . following equation is a typical one which is widely used in car - following models .",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 is a delay time of driver s response .",
    "the driver senses headway at time @xmath1 and changes the velocity of his car at later time @xmath18 .",
    "this delay time @xmath17 of response has been thought to be inevitable because it comes from the driver s physical delay of response to the stimulus together with the mechanical response time of a car . in this paper",
    ", this @xmath17 will be called `` explicit delay time '' .",
    "the notion of explicit delay time @xmath17 is completely different from that of `` delay time of car motion '' introduced in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "let us recall the definition of the delay time of car motion .",
    "consider a pair of cars , a leader and a follower .",
    "assume the leader changes the velocity according to @xmath19 and the follower duplicates the leader s velocity but with some delay time @xmath20 , that is , @xmath21 .",
    "under such a situation we can clearly define the delay time of car motion by @xmath20 .",
    "it is known that the observed delay time @xmath20 of car motion is of the order of 1 sec , but the known physical or mechanical response time @xmath17 is of the order of 0.1 sec . in the previous paper we confirmed that the equation ( [ neweq ] ) really produces @xmath20 of order 1 sec .",
    "we clarified that ovm can describe the properties of traffic flows or the behaviors of cars fairly well without any explicit delay time @xmath17 .",
    "however there exists the delay time of response of driver for a fact .",
    "the explicit delay time @xmath17 should be included in the dynamical equation in order to construct realistic models of traffic flow .",
    "it is a natural question what kind of effect appears in the traffic flow or in the car motion if we introduce the explicit delay in the equation([neweq ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the following equation @xmath22 in order to our analysis be more concrete , we use the parameter @xmath23 ( 1/sec ) and the function @xmath10 which are phenomenologically determined in previous papers by the observed data on japanese motorways @xcite .",
    "@xmath24\\ , \\label{ovreal}\\ ] ] in which the unit of length and time are meter and second respectively .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the global properties of traffic flow in ovm with the explicit delay . in section 3",
    "we investigate more microscopic property , that is , the delay time of car motion .",
    "first we discuss within a linear approximation and next evaluate the delay times of car motion in various cases by numerical simulations . as a special case , the car motion under the traffic signal is also treated . in section 4",
    "we show the new feature of ovm with the explicit delay .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this section we investigate ovm with the explicit delay time @xmath17 of driver s response described by equation ( [ new ] ) .",
    "first we analyze the linear stability of @xmath25-car system on a circular lane of length @xmath26 .",
    "obviously , the homogeneous flow solution of equation ( [ new ] ) is given by @xmath27 to see whether the solution ( [ eq : uniformsol ] ) is stable or not , we add a small perturbation @xmath28 from equation ( [ eq : perturb ] ) and equation ( [ new ] ) , we can calculate a linearized equation with respect to @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "a complete set of solutions is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 satisfies the equation @xmath37 = \\left(\\frac{f}{a}\\right ) \\left\\ { e^{i\\alpha_j } - 1 \\right\\ }   -i\\left(\\frac{\\omega_j}{a}\\right ) \\ .",

    "the condition that each solution @xmath38 becomes marginally stable is i m  @xmath39 . for convenience of explanation",
    ", we will omit the mode - index @xmath40 and treat @xmath41 as a continuous variable .",
    "the condition i m  @xmath42 gives ` critical curves ' for each @xmath43 in @xmath44 plane , where @xmath45 is a radial coordinate and @xmath41 is an angular coordinate .",
    "mode solutions @xmath38 are represented by a point @xmath46 on a circle @xmath45=const .",
    "three critical curves for @xmath43 = 0 , 0.2 and 0.4 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] , in which a reference circle represents mode solutions for @xmath47 .",
    "the modes staying outside ( right - hand side ) of the critical curve are unstable .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that a homogeneous flow state with a parameter @xmath47 is an unstable state . from figure [ fig1 ]",
    ", it is found that unstable modes increase as the explicit delay time @xmath17 becomes large .",
    "this situation looks similar to a case the sensitivity @xmath9 becomes small in the original ovm@xcite .",
    "though there seems to be some relationship between the sensitivity @xmath9 and the explicit delay time @xmath17 as indicated in ref.@xcite , an analytical relation has not been clarified yet .",
    "the effect of the explicit delay in the congestion formation can be evaluated by numerical simulations . in previous papers@xcite",
    ", we investigated the property of traffic flows in a circuit .",
    "it is found that when the car density exceeds a critical value , a homogeneous traffic flow becomes unstable and makes a phase transition to a congested flow . after enough time",
    ", the congested flow becomes stationary and shows an alternating pattern of high density ( congestion cluster ) and low density regions .",
    "each velocity and headway inside high ( low ) density regions always take common values which are determined only by the sensitivity @xmath9 and ovf independently of any other conditions .",
    "the motion of each car can be shown in a ` phase space ' ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , and the trajectories draw a single `` hysteresis loop '' , a kind of limit cycle .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows typical hysteresis loops for sensitivity @xmath23 and @xmath50 .",
    "two turning points @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the high and low density region for @xmath23 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "we found the congestion pattern moves backward on the circuit with a constant velocity @xmath56 , which is given by the intersection of @xmath49 axis and the line connecting two turning points @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the property of such congested flows is almost decided by two points @xmath57 and @xmath58 of hysteresis loop .    from numerical simulations ,",
    "we recognize no qualitative difference in the behavior of the traffic flow between the cases with and without the explicit delay , if @xmath17 is not so large .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows hysteresis loops for @xmath17 = 0 , 0.1 and 0.2 , that is , @xmath43 = 0 , 0.2 and 0.4 .",
    "the changes of hysteresis loops are similar to those for the case that the sensitivity @xmath9 becomes small in the original ovm@xcite .",
    "therefore it seems that the explicit delay time @xmath17 , which is not so large , does not play any essential role in the congestion formation . in other words ,",
    "the effect of the explicit delay can be almost compensated by the change of sensitivity @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , this is not the case for a very large @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows examples for @xmath59 where critical curves are inside the referenced circle @xmath60 . in original ovm instability",
    "always comes from long range modes @xmath61 , that is , short range modes @xmath62 are always stable . in the case",
    "@xmath63 , however , there exist various cases in which all modes become unstable or short range modes only become unstable . in such cases ,",
    "the instability starts from all modes or from short range modes .",
    "it is interesting to see what kind of phenomena emerge in such cases .",
    "an example shall be discussed in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the delay of car motion in order to see the effect of the explicit delay from a more microscopic viewpoint .",
    "first , we analyze the delay of car motion with the linear approximation .",
    "consider a pair of a leader and it s follower where the leader moves with the velocity @xmath64 and the follower replicates the motion of the leader after the time interval @xmath20 , that is , the follower s velocity is given by @xmath65 .",
    "in this case we can define the delay time of car motion as @xmath20 .",
    "let the position of the leader at time @xmath1 be @xmath66 and that of it s follower @xmath67 which obeys equation ( [ new ] ) , that is , @xmath68 starting from the situation with headway @xmath69 and velocity @xmath70 , @xmath71 we investigate the response of the follower @xmath72 to a small change @xmath73 of the leader : @xmath74 inserting above equations into equation ( [ leader_follower ] ) and taking a linear approximation , we get @xmath75 where @xmath76 is again a derivative of ovf at headway @xmath69 .",
    "if one takes @xmath77 , the solution is given by @xmath78 this is rewritten as @xmath79 where @xmath80^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] first let us consider the case @xmath81 is sufficiently small ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "it will be discussed later whether this condition is satisfied or not in the realistic situation used in equation ( [ ovreal ] ) .",
    "then we have @xmath83    here we take the general expression of @xmath73 which is expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85 is assumed to be nonzero only for @xmath86 small enough .",
    "then we find the follower s response becomes @xmath87 that is , @xmath88 with @xmath20 of equation([003 ] ) .    as a result",
    "we conclude that for sufficiently slow and small change of leader s velocity , the delay time @xmath20 of motion of the follower becomes @xmath89 ( the inverse of derivative of ovf at corresponding headway ) , independently of the explicit delay time @xmath17 of driver s response .",
    "next we will carry out numerical simulations to investigate the effect of the explicit delay in homogeneous traffic flows .",
    "the validity of the conditions @xmath90 can be checked also .",
    "we make simulations starting from homogeneous flows with various headways and add a small disturbance to the first car .",
    "the delay time of car motion is estimated between 10th car and 11th car when the disturbance propagates there .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we summarize the results of numerical simulation . in the cases where the homogeneous flow is stable ,",
    "the delay time @xmath20 of car motion is almost equal to @xmath89 and the explicit delay has no effect .",
    "the cases @xmath91 correspond to the unstable situation .",
    "the measurement of the delay time @xmath20 is carried out before the disturbance becomes large .",
    "the results show that the assumption @xmath90 is not valid . even in such cases",
    "the explicit delay does not affect @xmath20 .      in this subsection",
    ", we treat the car motion in a stationary congested flow , where linear analysis is no more valid obviously . in the previous paper@xcite",
    "we have shown that the delay time @xmath20 of car motion is the inverse of the gradient of line which connect two turning points ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 in figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is a natural extension of the statement obtained by the linear analysis : `` the delay time of car motion is the inverse of derivative of ovf at corresponding headway '' .",
    "our task here is to carry out similar numerical simulations with the explicit delay .",
    "after the congestion pattern becomes stable , all cars behave in the same manner expressed in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we can estimate the delay time @xmath20 from the time interval of the motion of successive two cars , which is equivalent to the gradient of line connecting two turning points of the hysteresis loop .",
    "table [ tab2 ] shows the results of simulations for @xmath92 .",
    "the table clearly shows that the change of @xmath20 is rather small compared to the change of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore the main contribution of the delay of car motion comes from the structure of ovm itself and not from the explicit delay .",
    "the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath20 appears only through the change of turning points of the hysteresis loop . in other words ,",
    "the effect of the explicit delay is similar to the change of the sensitivity @xmath9 and is not essential in the same as the previous section .      in this subsection",
    "we study the delay of motion of cars starting from a traffic signal .",
    "though this may be a special case compared to previous subsections , experiments to observe the delay time have often been done in this situation .",
    "numerical simulations are carried out as follows .",
    "first a traffic signal is red and all cars are waiting with headway 7 ( m ) , at which ovf ( [ ovreal ] ) becomes zero . at time @xmath93 , the signal changes to green and cars start .    figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show the velocities of several cars in a queue for the cases of @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( sec ) , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that cars with large car number ( 7th or more ) behave almost in the same manner as its preceding car .",
    "we can estimate the delay time @xmath20 from the behavior of velocities of 7 - 10th cars .",
    "table [ tab3 ] shows the delay time of car motion for various @xmath17 .",
    "again we find that the delay time @xmath20 has a small dependence on the explicit delay time @xmath17 .",
    "to see whether this is general or not , we carried out another simulations with the initial headway 3 ( m ) .",
    "for this purpose , ovf ( [ ovreal ] ) is changed to take zero for @xmath96 ( m ) .",
    "we show the results in the third column of table [ tab3 ] , which again show obviously a small dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath17 .",
    "hitherto we concerned the definition of delay time of car motion given in the section 1 : if velocities of two successive cars are given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , the delay time of car motion is @xmath20 .",
    "this definition is valid only for the case that the motions of two cars are similar . as is seen from figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , the first several cars move in the different manner , because the headway of the first car is infinite but that of other cars are relatively small . in order to explore the delay time of car motion in such case we will propose an another definition .",
    "for example , we can define the delay time as the interval between the time when the preceding car starts and the time when the next car starts .",
    "though there are many other possibilities , the above definition looks rather natural .    figure [ fig7 ] shows the delay time of car motion by the new definition . obviously the data approach to a certain values as the car number becomes large .",
    "the limits of the delay times in this definition are the same values as those in the previous definition .",
    "it should be mentioned that the explicit delay time @xmath17 is simply added to the delay time @xmath20 of car motion for first a few cars .",
    "this effect dissipates after several cars start .    from these results",
    ", we can conclude that the explicit delay time @xmath17 contributes directly to the delay time of car motion only for such a restricted case as for the motion of first a few cars starting from the traffic signal . in general case ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath17 to @xmath20 is rather small and is similar to the contribution from the change of the sensitivity @xmath9 .",
    "in this section we show new features which exist only in ovm with the explicit delay .",
    "we investigated the motion of cars controlled by a traffic signal in the previous section . for small @xmath17",
    "the motions of cars are not so different from those for @xmath97 . for large @xmath17 , however , we can see a transitional overshoot of velocity , that is , a excess and a gradual decrease of velocity . as a typical case ,",
    "the motions of cars for @xmath98 are shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "we have carried out many numerical simulations by changing @xmath17 and found that the overshoot phenomenon begins at @xmath99 ( sec ) .",
    "first we note that the explicit delay time @xmath17 is understood as the summarized effect coming from delays of physical and mechanical response .",
    "therefore too large value will not be permitted from observations .",
    "there exists , however , more restrictive bound , which has a origin in the equation of motion ( [ neweq ] ) of ovm .",
    "we consider a homogeneous equation of the linearized equation ( [ 002 ] ) in the leader - follower system : @xmath100 @xmath101 gives a perturbative motion of the follower when the leader moves in a constant velocity . in order",
    "that the two body system is stable , @xmath101 must vanish as time develops .",
    "we see that @xmath102 is a solution of equation ( [ eqn : homo ] ) , with @xmath86 satisfying @xmath103 the marginally stable condition i m @xmath86 = 0 becomes @xmath104 where @xmath105 . by eliminating @xmath106",
    ", we can find the upper bound of @xmath17 for given @xmath9 and @xmath107 .",
    "though we could not solve equation ( [ eqn : marg ] ) analytically , the upper bound @xmath108 is found to be a monotonic decreasing function of both @xmath9 and @xmath107 .",
    "the value of @xmath108 can be evaluated numerically . for the sensitivity @xmath9 = 2.0 ( 1/sec ) and",
    "the maximum value of @xmath107 = 1.44 ( 1/sec ) , which is read off from ovf ( [ ovreal ] ) , the corresponding upper bound @xmath108 is 0.44 ( sec ) .",
    "if @xmath109 ( sec ) in ovm with above @xmath9 and @xmath107 , the car can not follow the constant velocity motion of the leader .",
    "thus @xmath108 should be understood as the upper bound of the explicit delay time in order that ovm is meaningful as a model of traffic flow .      inside the above upper bound of the explicit delay time , some curious phenomena emerge in traffic flow as the explicit delay time becomes large .",
    "if such phenomena should be regarded as unrealistic , the upper bound will be taken at a smaller value .",
    "figure ( [ fig9 ] ) shows a snap shot of headway after enough simulation time .",
    "the conditions of the simulation are as follows : total car number @xmath25 = 100 , circuit length @xmath26 = 2500 ( m ) and explicit delay time @xmath17 = 0.22 ( sec ) .",
    "there we can see small congestion clusters or rapid change of velocity between 15th and 60th car .",
    "this pattern looks like a intermediate pattern before the congestion is formed completely .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of @xmath110 ( sec ) where such a pattern or small congestions disappear as time goes , the pattern has very long life and may never disappear in the case of @xmath111 ( sec ) .",
    "this pattern occupies a larger region as @xmath17 increase .",
    "next we take @xmath17 to be a larger value 0.4 ( sec ) .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the hysteresis loops for @xmath94 and 0.4 .",
    "here we note that ovf ( [ ovreal ] ) takes negative value continuously for @xmath96 ( m ) and therefore cars can move backward ( without collisions ) .",
    "because such behaviors of vehicles are obviously unrealistic , it seems natural to set the upper bound of @xmath17 to the transition point at which this hysteresis loop appears .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig10 ] , the profiles of hysteresis loops are qualitatively different .",
    "moreover the hysteresis loop for @xmath55 is larger than that for @xmath23 in the case of @xmath112 in contrast to the case of @xmath97 .",
    "we also note that the relaxation time for @xmath113 is of the order of @xmath114 times that for @xmath115 .",
    "the differences of hysteresis loops and relaxation times seem to suggest an existence of a new phase .",
    "however , there exists another possibility : the stationary state indicated by this hysteresis loop is artificial due to finite size effects and a new phase does not exist .",
    "the congestion pattern changes continuously around @xmath116 ( sec ) and we can not find a definite transition point .",
    "it is a future work whether this pattern indicates the existence of new phase or not .",
    "in this paper we investigated the properties of optimal velocity model with the explicit delay of driver s response .",
    "the effects of the explicit delay are very small , if the delay time is small : @xmath115 ( sec ) .",
    "the effects are similar to the change ( reduction ) of the sensitivity @xmath9 , and therefore the explicit delay does not play an essential role . this fact should be compared to the traditional car - following models , in which the delay of driver s response has played a significant role .",
    "the equation of motion of traditional car - following model becomes trivial , if the delay time is zero .    for large explicit delay time @xmath17",
    ", the traffic flow behaves in a different manner . if @xmath115 ( sec ) , the properties of congestion clusters are similar to that for @xmath97 . for @xmath117 ( sec ) , the stationary pattern of the traffic flow does not consist of only such congestion clusters but confused patterns . for @xmath118 ( sec ) ,",
    "the traffic flow becomes stationary but congestion clusters are never formed .    in ovm",
    ", there is an upper bound of the explicit delay time , which comes from the condition that the equation of motion is meaningful .",
    "the upper bound , however , becomes small , if we require the existence of stable congestion clusters .    from this work ,",
    "we can obtain an indication on a phenomenological study . in this paper",
    "we clarified the notions of the delay time @xmath17 of driver s response and the delay time @xmath20 of car motion . however the meaning of the delay time of response and its effect are model - dependent . in traditional car - following models",
    ", the delay time @xmath17 seems to be merely a fitting parameter and so we can take any value for @xmath17",
    ". moreover , the delay time often takes different value in each term . in ovm ,",
    "the delay time @xmath17 is not free and the observed value decided by experiments will give a criterion whether ovm with ovf ( [ ovreal ] ) is valid or not . here",
    "we note that the contribution of the delay of driver s response to the delay of car motion is very small .",
    "the delay of car motion , therefore , has it s root just in the dynamical equation itself .",
    "this fact suggests the difficulty to determine the delay time @xmath17 of driver s response by measuring the delay time @xmath20 of car motion .",
