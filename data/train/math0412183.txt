    "first , one might wonder whether the double branched covers can help us understand transverse knots and links .",
    "the classification of transverse knots is a very difficult task . indeed , while a few simplest knots , such as the unknot , the figure eight knot , and torus knots are completely classified by their topological knot type and the self - linking number @xcite , in general this is not true .",
    "the first examples of smoothly isotopic , but not transversely isotopic transverse knots @xmath9 , @xmath10 with the same self - linking number were given by birman and menasco @xcite .",
    "the existence of such pairs was also demonstrated by etnyre and honda @xcite via some  non - explicit \" examples .",

    "* theorem 3 ) .",

    "( theorem 3 in @xcite provides a family of pairs of transversely non - isotopic knots , not just a single pair .",
    "our result is true for all pairs of @xcite ) .    from another viewpoint ,",
    "double covers of @xmath1 branched over transverse links give an interesting special case of contact 3-manifolds .",
    "indeed , the works of giroux @xcite and others imply that every 3-dimensional contact manifold can be represented as a triple branched cover of @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that branched double covers are quite simple .",
    "we give an algorithm for finding a contact surgery diagram @xcite for @xmath8 ; the diagrams we get only involve surgeries on legendrian unknots .",

    "we now turn attention to the heegaard floer contact invariants .",
    "the heegaard floer theory of ozsvth and szab ( @xcite and sequels ) associates a homology group @xmath20 to a closed oriented 3-manifold @xmath21 and yields invariants for many low - dimensional objects . in particular , given a contact structure @xmath22 on @xmath21 ,",

    "( we assume that the coefficients are taken in @xmath25 . )",
    "propositions [ qua - pos ] and [ stab ] along with the surgery diagrams and properties of @xmath23 enable us to determine the ozsvth - szab contact invariant @xmath26 for @xmath19 in many cases .",
    "we observe that the contact invariant @xmath26 behaves very similarly to the khovanov - homological invariant of transverse links that we introduce in @xcite .",
    "this is not a mere coincidence . indeed , as proved by ozsvth and szab @xcite , for a smooth link @xmath3 there is a spectral sequence converging to @xmath27 whose @xmath28 term is given by the reduced khovanov homology of @xmath6 ( both theories are to be taken with @xmath29 coefficients ) .",
    "when the link @xmath6 is alternating , the spectral sequence of @xcite collapses at the @xmath28 stage , providing an isomorphism @xmath30 now , suppose the link @xmath6 is transverse , and @xmath7 is the induced contact structure on the branched double cover .",
    "let @xmath31 be the invariant of @xcite .",
    "we would like to suggest that the elements @xmath32 and @xmath26 correspond to one another under the isomorphism ( [ isom ] ) .",
    "however , we must be careful , because this isomorphism is not canonical : while the spectral sequence of @xcite is believed to be an invariant of the link , this invariance has not been proved . to deal with this issue",

    "the associated graded group of @xmath34 is of course isomorphic to @xmath34 , but the latter isomorphism is not canonical .",

    "we suggest    [ conjec ] if @xmath6 is a transverse representative of an alternating smooth link , then the homological grading of @xmath41 is the same as the filtration level of @xmath42 ( and this filtration level is @xmath37 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath43 under the isomorphism ( [ isom ] ) between @xmath36 and the associated graded group of @xmath34 .    in the general case ,",
    "it is plausible that @xmath26 somehow  corresponds \" to @xmath32 under the spectral sequence .    in the special case when the transverse link @xmath6 is represented by a transverse closed braid",
    "whose braid diagram is alternating , conjecture [ conjec ] is not hard to prove .",
    "[ psi = c ] let @xmath6 be a transverse link represented by a closed braid with an alternating braid diagram .",

    "it should be noted that alternating braids represent a very narrow class of links .",
    "we show that @xmath44 for all such links except the @xmath45-torus link .",
    "conjecture [ conjec ] implies that @xmath46 whenever @xmath47 .",
    "we are able to check this directly for many cases not covered by theorem [ psi = c ] ( see section [ osi ] ) .",
    "if proved in general , conjecture [ conjec ] , together with the fact that @xmath23 vanishes when @xmath22 is overtwisted @xcite , would give a powerful sufficient condition for the contact structure @xmath7 to be tight . indeed , for an arbitrary transverse link @xmath6 we can often show that @xmath47 by using arguments from @xcite or software @xcite , @xcite ; when @xmath48 is an alternating knot , it can be shown that @xmath49 if and only if @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the signature of the knot ( with the sign convention such that the right - handed trefoil has signature @xmath52 .",

    "it is clear that @xmath81 is a contact form ; moreover , the contact structure it defines inside the coordinate neighborhood of @xmath6 in @xmath4 is isotopic to @xmath82 , and therefore tight .",
    "( note that the pull - back form @xmath83 would not work for the entire @xmath4 : this form is not contact along the @xmath84-axis ! )    we have to check that the contact structure @xmath7 we obtain is independent of choices . to this end , observe that the characteristic foliation that @xmath7 induces on the torus @xmath64 is given by parallel longitudes of framing @xmath85 ( calculated with respect to the framing defined by @xmath86 ) .",
    "fix two of these parallel longitudes .",
    "they divide the torus @xmath64 into two annular regions ; by pushing one of these regions in and another one out , we can perturb this torus by an isotopy into a convex surface whose characteristic foliation is morse  smale , and the dividing set is given by the two parallel longitudes of framing @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , we can assume that the support of this isotopy lies outside the set @xmath87 .",
    "we denote the new convex torus by @xmath88 , and the tubular neighborhood of @xmath6 in @xmath4 that @xmath88 bounds by @xmath89 .    with given boundary conditions ,",
    "the tight contact structure in the solid torus bounded by @xmath88 is unique up to an isotopy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the tight contact structure on @xmath89 is uniquely determined by the boundary conditions , and , since our construction of @xmath7 outside of @xmath88 is canonical , the contact structure @xmath7 on @xmath4 is independent of all choices ( including the choice of @xmath63 )",
    ".    it will be helpful to think about transverse links by representing them by closed braids .",
    "for this , consider the symmetric version of @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "then , any closed braid around @xmath84-axis can be made transverse to the contact planes ; moreover , any transverse link in @xmath1 is transversely isotopic to a closed braid @xcite .    to define the self - linking number @xmath17 , trivialize the plane field @xmath22 , and",
    "let the link @xmath92 be the push - off of @xmath6 in the direction of the first coordinate vector for @xmath22 .",
    "then , @xmath17 is the linking number between @xmath6 and @xmath92 .",
    "given a closed braid representation of @xmath6 , we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) is the number of positive ( negative ) crossings , and @xmath96 is the number of strings in the braid .",
    "the _ stabilization _ of a transverse link represented as a braid is equivalent to the negative braid stabilization , i.e. adding an extra string and a negative kink to the braid .",
    "if @xmath97 be the result of stabilization of @xmath6 , then @xmath98 note that the positive braid stabilization does not change the transverse type of the link .    we will often describe a braid by its braid word on the standard generators @xmath99 and their inverses , and draw associated braid diagrams .",
    "in this section , we establish the correspondence between the crossings of the braid diagram representing the transverse link @xmath6 and the surgeries required to obtain the contact manifold @xmath18 from @xmath1 .",
    "this correspondence is our main tool : it allows to build contact surgery diagrams and plays the key role in other results of this paper .",

    "we often refer to legendrian surgery as @xmath103 contact surgery ( comparing the surgery framing to the framing given by contact planes ) .",
    "it is also possible to make sense of @xmath104 contact surgery ( in fact , any rational @xmath105 surgery ) @xcite .",
    "the new contact manifold is obtained by cutting out a tubular neighborhood of the knot @xmath48 ( i.  e. a solid torus ) and gluing it back in so that the contact structure on the solid torus matches the contact structure on its complement ; when the surgery coefficient is @xmath106 with @xmath107 , the result of this procedure is independent of choices .",
