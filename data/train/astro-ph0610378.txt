    "a cardinal result in extra - galactic astronomy over the last 20 years has been the discovery by _ iras _ of a population of local ultra luminous infra - red galaxies ( ulirgs  soifer et al .",
    "( 1986 ) ; see also sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) , and lonsdale , farrah & smith ( 2006 ) ) .",
    "although these galaxies are rare in the local universe , their extreme ir - luminosities ( @xmath5 ) and merger morphologies strongly suggest that they signify a highly active and important phase in galaxy evolution  a scenario which is corroborated by the rapid increase in their space density with redshift .",
    "furthermore , ulirgs  being gas - rich mergers harboring the most extreme star - forming conditions encountered in the local universe  are thought to re - enact the galaxy formation processes we are only barely able to glimpse in the distant universe .",
    "although , detailed studies of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in proto - galaxies at high redshifts will be possible with the new generation of cm / mm / sub - mm telescopes and receivers coming online within the next decade , our expectations of how such objects will look in mm / sub - mm line emission are ill - informed due to the dearth of similar data locally .",
    "multi - line studies of the low - intensity starbursts m82 and ngc253 have been made ( nguyen - q - rieu et al .",
    "1992 ; jackson et al .",
    "1995 ; paglione , jackson & ishizuki 1997 ) , but given that their star formation rates are about three orders of magnitude lower than that of typical ulirgs , they may very well not be good guides for the state of the ism in local ulirgs and high-@xmath6 starbursts ( aalto et al .",
    "1995 ; papadopoulos & seaquist 1998 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , local ulirgs , owing to their extreme ir / co - brightness , are ideal targets for multi - line studies of heavy rotor molecules such as hcn , cs and hco@xmath1",
    ". these lines are usually @xmath7 times weaker than their co @xmath8-level counterparts , making them currently impossible to detect in more distant galaxies and/or galaxies with lower star formation rates . secondly , their compact h@xmath9 distributions  as revealed by interferometric maps ( e.g.  scoville et al .  1997 ; tacconi et al .  1999 )",
    " allow us to collect the total line flux of these often weak lines with a single pointing .",
    "this is important since multi - beam receivers , capable of observing many transitions of a variety of species within a reasonable amount of telescope time , are still lacking .",
    "these two factors , brightness and relatively compact molecular gas distributions , allow us to study the properties of the dense ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) gas phase in local ulirgs in much greater detail than would otherwise be possible .",
    "this is of great importance , because the dense gas provides the immediate star formation fuel in galaxies ( gao & solomon 2004a , b ; wu et al .",
    "the possibility of a universal star formation efficiency , as proposed by these studies , can now be checked in a much more powerful manner , since we can estimate the dense h@xmath9 mass using multiple lines rather than a single line such as hcn @xmath12 .    in the local universe , arp220 and",
    "ngc6240 are ideally suited for studies of the dense gas in extreme starburst galaxies , as they are the two most studied ( u)lirgs to date .",
    "they have the best sampled fir / sub - mm spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of their class ( e.g.  dopita et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the largest number of mm / sub - mm co , hcn , cs , and hco@xmath1 transitions already observed .",
    "thus not only are their dust continuum seds well constrained , but it is also relatively straightforward to fill the gaps in their molecular line inventory . being the nearest and best studied , arp220 is the ulirg most frequently used as a template for high-@xmath6 studies of starbursts .",

    "2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we present single - dish observations of a number of molecular emission lines from arp220 and ngc6240 , which together with results from the literature allows us to compile a very large ( and almost identical ) molecular transition catalog for these two extreme starbursts .",
    "armed with this unique catalog , and the large range of excitation conditions it can probe ( with significant overlap / redudancy between hcn and cs lines ) we use it to : a ) set constraints on the physical properties of the dense molecular gas phase , b ) find the gas density probed per molecular species and its mass range , and c ) explore underlying star formation efficiencies , density - size hierarchies , and examine the species best suited for tracing the true star forming phase .",

    "[ section : analysis ] details the analysis of our observations , which includes deriving dense gas mass and star formation efficiencies based on the radiative transfer modeling of the observed lines . in  [ section : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of upcoming missions such as herschel . in the flat cosmology ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15kms@xmath16mpc@xmath17 ",

    "the two jcmt receivers @xmath21(211 - 279ghz ) and @xmath22(312 - 370ghz ) were employed in order to observe all the lines , with the @xmath22 receiver tuned in ssb mode . in order to ensure baselines as flat as possible ,",

    "the pointing was checked every 1 - 2hr throughout each observing run and was @xmath26 ( rms ) or better .",
    "aperture and main beam efficiencies were derived from observations of mars and uranus throughout the observing runs and were compared to mean jcmt values over for the observing periods .",

    "the beam size of the 30-m telescope is 28at 115ghz and 12at 217ghz .",

    "total integration times were 1.2 hours for arp220 and almost 2 hours for ngc6240 in hcn 10 and @xmath18co 21 ( table [ table : jcmt - observations ] ) . to obtain the flattest possible baselines , the wobbler switching ( nutating subreflector ) observing mode was employed with a frequency of 0.5hz and beam throws of @xmath29 .",
    "both targets were observed under good weather conditions in the late night hours with @xmath30k at 3 mm and @xmath31k at 1 mm on the antenna temperature ( @xmath32 ) scale . pointing and focus were checked frequently throughout observations , and the pointing errors",

    "the observations were done with a wobbler switching of 180 - 240  in azimuth .",
    "the data were calibrated with cold and ambient loads and , depending on frequency and weather , single sideband temperatures were 200 - 600k .",

    "recent interferometric observations with the submillimeter array ( sma ) showed that the co 32 and the 890-@xmath67 m dust emission is indeed strongest in the western nucleus ( sakamoto et al .",

    "[ figure : spectra - arp220]c and d , respectively .",
    "although the @xmath18co lines seem somewhat narrower than their @xmath0co counterparts , this may be simply an effect of the low signal - to - noise ratio in the line wings and the uncertain baseline level .",
    "in general all the @xmath0co and @xmath18co lines seem to have very similar line profiles , within the available signal - to - noise .",
    "both the @xmath18co 10 and 21 spectra observed with the iram 30-m show tentative evidence of double peaks , consistent with the @xmath0co lines . in the 10 spectrum ,",

    "the fact the @xmath18co 21 spectra obtained with the two telescopes are in agreement in terms of line shape as well as flux density gives us confidence our observations are able to robustly discern the line shapes of even faint lines like @xmath18co 21 .",

    "they both show evidence of double peaks with the @xmath70kms@xmath16 component being more prominent .",
    "the shape is unlike the hcn(10 ) spectrum  as well as the @xmath0co 21 and 32 spectra  where the @xmath71kms@xmath16 component is brighter .",
    "the cs lines  of which only cs 32 has been previously reported for arp220  trace a much overlaping excitation range with that of hcn ( see table 6 ) , and are shown in fig .",

    "all cs lines have double - horn profiles , with the @xmath70kms@xmath16 peak stronger in the cs 32 , 54 , and 76 spectra , while the two peaks are almost the same strength in the 21 spectrum .",
    "this mimicks the observed evolution from low- to high-@xmath8 in the hcn line profiles .",
    "we note , however , the apparent asymmetry of the cs 32 line may be an artifact of the limited receiver bandwidth . in determining the baseline , we forced the right edge of this spectrum to zero , so",
    "our line flux estimate for this line is likely an underestimate .    finally , in the last column of fig .",
    "[ figure : spectra - arp220 ] , we show the hco@xmath1 43 , hnc 10 , and the blended c@xmath34o 10 and hnco 5@xmath724@xmath73 lines .",
    "similarly to the hcn and cs lines , the hco@xmath1 spectrum peaks at @xmath66kms@xmath16 , and shows some faint emission at @xmath63kms@xmath16 , which corresponds to the stronger @xmath0co feature . in this respect",
    ", the hco@xmath1 spectrum looks similar to cs 76 , where the western component is almost completely quenched . in stark contrast to this ,",
    "the double - horn spectrum of hnc 10 shows a remarkably strong emission peak at @xmath74kms@xmath16 , suggesting a substantial fraction of the hnc is concentrated in the western nucleus .",

    "[ figure : spectra - arp220]n . in order to determine separate parameters for c@xmath34o 10 and hnco 5@xmath724@xmath73",
    ", two gaussian components with the same width and fixed separation were fitted . from the resulting intensities we calculated integrated line fluxes and luminosities ( table [ table : lines ] ) .",
    "it is telling that the double - horn structure seen in the low-@xmath8 @xmath0co spectra is also discernible in the high-@xmath8 spectra of hcn , cs , and hco@xmath1 , albeit with the relative strengths of the two peaks reversed .",
    "in fact , a rather clear trend is apparent : the @xmath63kms@xmath16 peak is stronger in the @xmath0co 21 spectrum , the peaks are about equally strong in the @xmath0co 32 and hcn 10 profiles , and the @xmath66kms@xmath16 peak is stronger in the hcn 32 and 43 spectra .",
    "thus , as we climb the @xmath8-ladder and probe higher and higher critical densities , the strength of the emission shifts from the western to the eastern nucleus .",
    "this picture is confirmed by the cs 76 , and hco@xmath1 43 spectra which have even higher critical densities than the hcn 10 line and are completely dominated by the @xmath66kms@xmath16 component with very little or no emission at all at @xmath74kms@xmath16 .",
    "an important point to make here is that it is only due to the high - density gas tracers such as hco@xmath1 , hcn and cs that we are able to conclude that the eastern nucleus harbours most of the dense gas . without those ,",
    "we would have been inclined to conclude , based on the co 32 spectrum ( fig.[figure : spectra - arp220]b ) and its distribution ( sakamoto et al .",
    "2008 ) , that most of the dense gas was contained in the western component .    given the modest ( yet real ) differences of the relative line strengths across the velocity range of arp220 , and for reasons of simplicity and straightforward comparison to ngc6240 , we decided to use the line intensities average over its entire profile and the associated line ratios in our susbesquent analysis (  [ section : analysis ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0co 21 and 32 spectra of ngc6240 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : spectra - ngc6240]a and b , respectively . unlike arp220",
    ", the @xmath0co 32 and 21 spectra in ngc6240 have almost identical shapes , with spectra having a single - peaked profile , skewed towards the blue ( @xmath71kms@xmath16 relative to @xmath75 ) .",
    "this is consistent with high - resolution interferometric observations of low-@xmath8 @xmath0co lines in the inner regions of ngc6240 , which suggest more than half of the molecular gas resides in a central structure dominated by turbulent flows , rather than systematic orbital motion ( tacconi et al .",
    "the @xmath18co 21 spectra obtained with the jcmt and iram 30-m are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : spectra - ngc6240]c and d , respectively , and both appear similar in shape to their @xmath0co counterparts .",

    "2005 ) , this is the first time the 32 and 43 transitions have been detected in this galaxy .",
    "all three hcn lines peak at @xmath74kms@xmath16 and are consistent with the co line profiles .    unlike arp220 , where several cs lines were observed ,",
    "only the 76 line was observed in ngc6240 due to limited observing time . the spectrum is shown in fig .   [ figure : spectra - ngc6240]h",
    "this is the only detection of cs in ngc6240 to date and the line profile is consistent with those of co and hcn .",

    "2005 ) and is consistent with a single peak at @xmath76kms@xmath16 .    in summary , all of the transitions detected in ngc6240 exhibit a similar , gaussian - like velocity profile , peaking at about the same velocity ( @xmath77kms@xmath16 ) , in contrast to arp220 where all the lines not only show a double - peaked profile but a strong evolution in the dominant peak is also discernible .",
    "the similar velocity profile over such a large range of densities probed in ngc6240 signifies a kinematical state of the molecular gas where the various phases remain well - mixed down to much smaller scales than in arp220 where the denser phases seem settled to two counter - rotating dense gas disks , enveloped by a much more diffuse co - bright gas phase .",
    "sub - arcsec interferometric imaging of the hcn , cs and hco@xmath1 imaging of these systems is valuable in confirming such a picture , a possible result of the different merger state of these two strongly interacting systems .",
    "a major goal of this study was to use our observations as well as results from the literature to compile a large , identical molecular line catalog for arp220 and ngc6240 .",
    "thus the literature was scanned for all relevant molecular line measurements and for each transition the weighted average of every independent flux measurement was calculated . in cases where a measurement deviated significantly from the mean for obvious reasons ( limited bandwidth , poor conditions , etc . )",
    ", it was discarded from the average .",
    "note that often in the literature line measurements are given only in ( main beam or antenna ) temperature units and only rarely in janskys .",
    "in those cases , we used the aperture and/or main beam efficiencies quoted in the paper or , if those were not given , the average values for the particular telescope ( typically tabulated in the observing manual ) .",
    "the final tally of lines is given in table [ table : lines ] along with their corresponding fluxes and global line luminosities .",
    "global line ratios were calculated as the velocity / area averaged brightness temperature ratios ( equivalent to taking the ratio of the line luminosities ) and are listed in tables [ table : line - ratios - diffuse ] and [ table : line - ratios - dense ] .",
    "our observations of @xmath0co 21 in both arp220 and ngc6240 yield somewhat higher line fluxes than previous single - dish and interferometry observations listed in table [ table : lines ] , although , we note that wiedner et al .",

    "a careful scrutiny of the individual sub - scans in our data and of the calibration on the dates the observations were made revealed nothing out of the ordinary .",
    "in fact , given that each source was observed on different nights , yet both have @xmath78 per cent higher line fluxes than previously published values , suggest that the offset may well be real .",
    "a close inspection of previously published @xmath0co 21 spectra reveals they all suffer from either limited bandwidth ( the case for single - dish measurements ) , and/or the sources have been over - resolved spatially ( in the case of interferometric observations ) . because only few observations favor the higher @xmath0co 21 fluxes in arp220 and ngc6240 , however , we conservatively adopt the mean flux value of all available measurements for our analysis .",
    "the hcn 43 line in arp220 was first observed by wiedner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who found a line flux only half as large as ours . here",
    ", we adopt our own measurement since our spectrum has a higher signal - to - noise ratio than that of wiedner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and the latter used aperture efficiencies which deviate significantly from the standard values given for jcmt .    in ngc6240",
    "we find a hcn 10 flux that is half the previously published single - dish measurement ( solomon , downes & radford 1992a ) but is in excellent agreement with the infererometric measurement by nakanishi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . because our data were obtained over the course of two days in excellent weather conditions and because a careful reduction of the data from each day separately yielded consistent results , we find the lower values more likely . in the case of arp220 ,",
    "our estimate of the hcn 10 line flux is about 35 per cent larger than that of solomon , downes & radford ( 1992a ) , which is just within the errors .",
    "recent , independent observations of the hcn 10 line in arp220 and ngc6240 with the iram 30-m telescope yield line fluxes in agreement with our measurements ( graci - carpio private communications ) , suggesting the hcn 10 line fluxes given by solomon , downes & radford ( 1992a ) may have been affected by systematic calibration uncertainties .",

    "however , unlike m82 and ngc253 , where only the @xmath0co 10 and 21 transitions have been observed over their entire extent ( e.g.  wei , walter & scoville 2005 ) , our study picks up the global emission from arp220 and ngc6240 for all transitions , allowing for an unbiased study of the properties of _ their entire molecular gas reservoir _ using the corresponding mm / sub - mm line ratios .",
    "this mirrors observations of the mm / sub - mm lines observed in high-@xmath6 starbursts where much fewer lines are available , and thus can not yield meaningful constraints on the conditions or the mass per gas phase for their molecular gas reservoirs .",
    "the first indication that the molecular ism in extreme starburst galaxies is fundamentally different from that of normal galaxies came from the observation that the former have much larger @xmath0co@xmath79co line ratios ( e.g.  casoli , dupraz & combes 1992 ) .",
    "these are almost exclusively observed in ulirgs and were interpreted as either due to missing @xmath18co caused by a top - heavy initial mass function in these extreme systems ( casoli , dupraz & combes 1992 ) or due to purely optical depth effects ( i.e. , low @xmath0co optical depths ) caused by a warm and highly turbulent h@xmath9 medium present in these objects ( aalto et al .",

    "it is instructive to examine how far a single gas phase can go in terms of explaining the observed line ratios in arp220 and ngc6240 before the fit becomes inadequate and a second gas phase must be introduced . to this end",
    "we employ a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model based on the work by richardson ( 1985 ) , which uses the observed co line ratios to constrain the gas density ( @xmath82 ) , kinetic temperature ( @xmath83 ) , and @xmath84(dv / dr)^{-1}$ ] , which is the co abundance relative to h@xmath9 divided by the cloud velocity gradient .",

    "the need for a two - phase molecular ism is perhaps most obvious in arp220 , where no single lvg solution can account for even the @xmath0co 10 , 21 , and 32 lines . in this system",
    "we have the interesting situation where the ratio @xmath91co ( 21)/(10)@xmath92 points towards sub - thermal excitation of even @xmath0co 21 ( @xmath93 ) where typically @xmath94 and @xmath95k fits such a ratio well ( for lte such a low ratio implies @xmath96k the minimum gas temperature permitted by cosmic - ray heating , goldsmith & langer 1978 ) .",

    "the analysis of hco@xmath1 and cs line ratios with their corresponding @xmath193 and @xmath82 values yields corresponding conversion factors which , along with the luminosities of the lowest hco@xmath1 and cs transitions available , yield the dense gas mass traced by each species ( table  [ table : dense - gas - masses ] ) .",
    "the constraints of an underlying density - size cloud hierarchy ( see section 4.5 ) demand @xmath194 ( since the hcn , cs lines are tracing a denser gas than those of hco@xmath1 ) . thus from table 8",

    "the dense gas masses estimated with the second method ( see table 8) bracket the best estimates yielded by the first one ( constrained by the density - mass hierarchy assumtion ) , though more tightly for arp220 than ngc6240 .",

    "we opt for a simpler approach in which the denser hcn - bright gas is simply assumed to be `` nested '' within the less dense regions traced by the hco@xmath1 transitions .",

    "we briefly explore this scenario by calculating three separate star formation efficiencies , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270 , using the separate dense gas mass estimates based on hco@xmath1 , hcn , and cs available for arp220 only .",
    "for this galaxy we find @xmath270 ( @xmath271 ) is larger than @xmath269 ( @xmath272 ) , which may suggest that the star formation increases as we probe higher densities ( shirley et al .",
    "2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this trend is not confirmed by hco@xmath1 , which yields @xmath273 , just as we do not see a significantly narrower range in @xmath274-values at higher densities as one might otherwise expect ( shirley et al .",
    "2003 ) . in ngc6240",
    "the star formation efficiency derived from hco@xmath1 ( @xmath275 ) is smaller than the efficiency obtained from hcn ( @xmath276 ) .",
    "we conclude that given the uncertainties in the mass estimates we can not robustly claim a significant increase in the sfes derived using hco@xmath1 , hcn and cs .",
    "theory currently provides some hints that support a small range of star formation efficiencies per dense gas mass .",
    "simulations of star formation in turbulent media where dense ( @xmath277@xmath11 ) gas clumps decouple from a supersonic , turbulent cascade to form stars at a constant efficiency seem to reproduce well some of the observed characteristics of sfr versus gas in galaxies ( krumholz & mckee 2005 ) . furthermore , scoville ( 2003 ) showed that the negative feedback effect of high - mass star formation naturally leads to an upper bound on the sfe for star forming regions of @xmath278 .",
    "although the exact value of this upper limit may change in the future ( since it depends on the poorly constrained effective radiative opacity of the dust ) , the underlying physics is expected to apply to local star forming regions as well as those in circumnuclear starbursts .",
    "we note that our derived sfes are consistent with the current upper limit .",
    "evidence from galactic observations and recent results from the ulirg / qso mrk231 ( papadopoulos , isaak & van der werf 2007 ) point to the same gas phase responsible for both hcn and high-@xmath8 co line emission .",
    "this is expected , as such a phase is intimately linked with ongoing star formation and thus its warm and dense conditions will excite the high-@xmath8 co transition and those of hcn , cs and hco@xmath1 alike .",
    "thus the weaker lines of heavy rotor molecules with frequencies within the numerous transparent atmospheric windows at @xmath279 , can be used to probe the gas emitting also the luminous co @xmath280 lines at frequencies of @xmath281 beyond which the atmospheric transparency window rapidly closes , even in sites where prime sub - mm telescopes are located .    in fig .",
    "[ figure : herschel - predictions](a ) and ( c ) we have plotted the expected line fluxes of the @xmath0co and @xmath18co line templates  based on arp220 and ngc6240 , respectively  for redshifts @xmath282 , and @xmath283 . the @xmath0co and @xmath18co line fluxes were extracted from the lvg model with input conditions set by the hcn solution ranges for the dense gas in these two systems ( table [ table : solutions ] ) . similarly , fig .",
    "[ figure : herschel - predictions](b ) and ( d ) show the hcn / cs / hco@xmath1 line templates for the solution ranges given in table [ table : solutions ] . for comparison",
    "we also show the latest sensitivity estimates for the hi - fi instrument ( de graauw et al .",
    "1998 , 2005 )  a series of highly advanced heterodyne receivers due to fly onboard herschel , an esa cornerstone mission expected to launch in 2008 .",
    "hi - fi will observe in six bands covering the frequency range 4801910ghz , enabling it to target the highest @xmath8-transitions in low-@xmath6 sources .",
    "[ figure : herschel - predictions ] shows that if arp220 and ngc6240 are not significantly different from the bulk population of ( u)lirgs in the redshift range @xmath284 , hi - fi / herschel will be able to detect the co @xmath285 lines in such objects out to @xmath286 in less than 1hr . at @xmath287",
    "the co @xmath288 lines are still within the hi - fi frequency range , and are easily detectable .",
    "we see the hcn and hco@xmath1 @xmath289 lines are detectable in systems akin to arp220 and ngc6240 out to @xmath286 . at @xmath287 , however , hcn lines are still detectable only in arp220-like systems . _",
    "the predicted hco@xmath1 lines fluxes for both type of systems at @xmath287 fall below the 1hr @xmath290-@xmath291 sensitivity limits of hi - fi_.    thus for ( u)lirgs in the redshift range @xmath292 , hi - fi will complement ground - based ( sub)mm facilities where only the low-@xmath8 lines are accessible and thereby densely sample the rotational ladder for a number of important molecules in such systems .",
    "this will allow a full inventory of the molecular ism in luminous starbursts and ( u)lirgs and provide a valuable set of low-@xmath6 templates for interpretation of high-@xmath8 detections in extremely distant galaxies ( @xmath293 ) with alma . characterizing these transitions relative to the lower ones in the local extreme starburst population ",
    "similar to the need to understand local dust seds before interpreting the very few frequency points detected for the dust continuum in high-@xmath6 galaxies  will prove to be extremely valuable before embarking on the high-@xmath8 , high-@xmath6 ventures with alma .",
    "the main results presented in this paper are : + 1 . using the jcmt and iram 30-m telescopes we report first detections of a number of important molecular lines , including transitions of @xmath294 , hcn , cs , and hco@xmath1 , in the two prototypical ulirgs arp220 and ngc6240 .",
    "these observations along with measurements from the literature complete what is currently the largest molecular line catalog for such systems , capable of probing a wide range of densities and temperatures , especially for their important dense and warm star - forming gas phase .    \\2 . in arp220",
    "a systematic change in line profile as higher densities are probed suggests large scale gas phase segregations within this ulirg .",
    "this is not observed in ngc6240 even in the profiles of lines widely separated in their excitation requirements such as @xmath121co j=21 and hcn j=43 .",
    "this points to the exciting possibility of using high-@xmath8/high - dipole molecular lines to deduce the state of gas relaxation in ulirgs by simply comparing the profiles of lines with widely different excitation requirements .",
    "this could prove important since currently only in the closest ulirgs can interferometry be relied upon to reveal the state of the gas directly .",
    "a single molecular gas phase is inadequate to account for the observed properties of the molecular ism in arp220 and ngc6240 .",
    "analysis of the numerous line ratios using a two - phase lvg model finds a diffuse ( @xmath295 ) phase that is most likely unbound , and a dense gas phase ( @xmath296 ) that contains the bulk of the molecular gas in these systems ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "the four highly excited hcn rotational transitions ( also four cs transitions for arp220 ) correspond to a gas phase that is @xmath181 times denser than that suggested by the low , sub - thermal , hco@xmath1 line ratios measured in both systems .",
    "_ thus hcn trace a denser gas phase than the hco@xmath1 lines .",
    "_ moreover , these two phases are found consistent with an underlying density - size power law , albeit with a steeper exponent than that found in galactic gmcs ( i.e. the larson s law for densities ) .",
    "we argue that this could be another result of the extreme tidal stripping of gmcs in these strongly interacting systems .",
    "we also find that for cs all realistic solutions imply @xmath298 , which suggest that _ the true cs abundance is significantly higher ( by an order of magnitude ) than the assumed abundance ( @xmath134 = 10^{-9}$ ] ) . _",
    "+ 5 . finally , using arp220 and ngc6240 as templates for starburst galaxies at higher redshifts , we show that the hi - fi instrument onboard herschel will be ideal for detect very high-@xmath8 transitions of co / hcn / cs / hco@xmath1 in such objects out to redshifts of @xmath287 while still preserving the all important information about their relative velocity profiles .",
    "thus the herschel space observatory , in conjuction with an ongoing large mm / sub - mm molecular line survey of extreme starbursts , will be able to produce the first densely sampled rotational ladders of co , hcn , and hco@xmath1 for ( u)lirgs in the local universe , a prerequisite in understanding star formation and its relation to dense gas in extreme starbursts localy and in their high redshift counterparts .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a thorough report which helped improve the paper substantially .",
    "we are grateful to all the telescope operators at the iram 30-m and the long - standing support we enjoy from the jcmt support personel and telescope operators .",
    "we are particular thankful to jim hoge at the jcmt for his active role in getting the observations done , often during adverse technical conditions .",
