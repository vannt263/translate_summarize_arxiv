    "the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet)@xcite is a useful theoretical tool to treat physical processes with energetic light particles in a systematic way . for an energetic particle moving in the @xmath1 direction , the momentum can be decomposed into @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a large scale , and @xmath1 , @xmath4 are lightlike vectors satisfying @xmath5 , @xmath6 . each component has a distinct scale in powers of @xmath7 which is a typical hadronic scale , and scet describes the interactions of the collinear particles and the ultrasoft ( usoft ) particles with momentum @xmath8 .",
    "since there are three distinct scales for the momentum of a collinear particle , scet employs a two - step matching process by integrating out large energy scales successively @xcite . in the first stage the degrees of freedom of order @xmath3 from the full theory are integrated out to produce @xmath9 . in @xmath9 , collinear particles are allowed to interact with usoft particles and the typical virtuality of the collinear particles is @xmath10 . in the second stage",

    "we also discuss and compare delicate physical meanings and implications of the parton distribution functions in the endpoint region , defined both in the full theory and in scet .",
    "in addition to showing the factorization , we take one step further to consider another aspect of dis , namely the behavior of the longitudinal structure function near the endpoint region .",
    "the longitudinal structure function vanishes at leading order in @xmath0 due to the fact that the parton ( quark ) in the proton has spin 1/2 .",

    "the method to compute the forward scattering amplitudes in dis using scet is described .",
    "the leading and the subleading currents are introduced and the prescription for the usoft factorization is explained . in section [ f1 ] ,",
