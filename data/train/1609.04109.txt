    "specifically , by proposition [ relationunderdeformations ] we have the following result .        [ weingiengin ]",
    "if @xmath3 is closed and conformal but not parallel with respect to @xmath1 , then @xmath45 is closed and conformal with respect to @xmath46 after @xmath3-deforamtions if and only if the deformation factors satisfies @xmath241 where @xmath73 is a non - zero constant .",
    "the above fact shows that if @xmath1 has closed and conformal @xmath2-forms , then we can obtain many new metrics having closed and conformal @xmath2-forms too .",
    "in particular , it is known that if @xmath1 is of constant sectional curvature , then all its closed and conformal @xmath2-forms can be completely determined locally@xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath242 is of constant sectional curvature @xmath243 , then it can be expressed as @xmath244 in some local coordinate system , and its closed and conformal @xmath2-forms are given by @xmath245 in the same coordinate system , where @xmath246 is a constant and @xmath247 is a constant vector .",
    "in this case , the dual conformal vectors field of @xmath248 are very simple and given by @xmath249      [ womeingengiengi ] the riemmannian metric @xmath255 has closed and conformal @xmath2-form expressed as @xmath256 where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are two arbitrary functions with an additional condition @xmath259 .",
    "moreover , @xmath260 .",
    "notice that parts of riemannian metrics in corollary [ womeingengiengi ] have constant sectional curvature . for instant ,",
    "if @xmath74 and @xmath261 , then @xmath46 is just the metric ( [ h ] ) and @xmath45 is just the @xmath2-form ( [ wflat ] ) with @xmath262 and @xmath252 . if @xmath74 and @xmath263 , then @xmath264 also has constant sectional curvature @xmath265 .",
