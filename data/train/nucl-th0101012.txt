    "[ introd ] for a long time , the fine structure of the isotopic dependence , i.e. dependence on the neutron number , of nuclear charge radii could not be explained satisfactorily .",
    "because of the apparent lack of relevant experimental information , the effective particle  particle ( pp ) force which leads to the observed pairing properties of nuclei , has mostly been assumed in a very simple form , just sufficient to produce reasonable gap parameters @xmath0 extracted from the observed odd - even staggering in the nucleon separation energies . even more sophisticated effective interactions ,",
    "e.g. the gogny force  @xcite , do not include a density dependence in the pp channel .",
    "it then has been demonstrated in hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) type calculations that three- or four - body forces are essential to reproduce the experimental data on isotope shifts of nuclear charge radii  @xcite , and indeed that these isotope shifts give indirect experimental information on the effective in - medium many - body force , or what is equivalent , on the density dependence of the effective interaction , particularly in the pp channel .",
    "it should be emphasized that a better knowledge of the density dependence of the nuclear pairing force would give the possibility to predict the pairing gap as a function of nuclear matter density which is , in particular , of great importance for understanding the pairing phenomena in neutron stars .",
    "it is well known that at present the pairing gap can not be obtained with sufficient accuracy from nuclear matter calculations based on bare nn interaction .",
    "the empirical information gained from the studies of real nuclei , specifically from the combined analyses of the nucleon separation energies and isotope shifts in charge radii , seems to be indispensable in this respect .",
    "a more general remark is that , as one may notice , a `` good '' microscopic theory , which could supply an effective interaction for describing the nuclear ground states and low - energy nuclear structure on a satisfactory level , is still lacking .",
    "the presently most successful _ simultaneous _ description of the _ bulk _ nuclear properties , such as binding energies and radii , throughout the periodic chart is achieved with phenomenological density - dependent interaction such as the skyrme force  @xcite .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that some major effects produced by the density dependence of the effective interaction in the particle  hole ( ph ) channel , which is the second variational derivative of the corresponding energy - density functional with respect to normal density , are now established fairly well . on the same ground",
    ", one expects that _ simultaneous _ description of the _ differential _ observables , such as odd - even mass differences and the odd - even effects in radii , would shed light on the density dependence of the effective interaction in the pp channel .    in  @xcite an effective interaction",
    "has been chosen which consisted of two- and three- ( or four- ) body parts , with parameters adjusted independently of those of the single - particle potential used for the shell model description of the reference nucleus .",
    "only differences with respect of this reference nucleus have been calculated in a self - consistent way .",
    "this procedure corresponds to the philosophy of the landau - migdal theory of finite fermi systems  @xcite , where there is no simple connection between the single particle well parameters and the effective interaction of quasiparticles close to the fermi surface",
    ". however , there are consistency requirements  @xcite and since the parameters have been fitted to a large number of data , a quite reliable set of force parameters is available  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of refs .",
    "@xcite has been restricted by the requirement that it should reduce to the migdal force in the ph channel , the three - body part leading to the density dependence .    in the meantime , since migdal had formulated his theory of finite fermi systems ( ffs ) , there has been much progress in hartree - fock calculations  @xcite , as well as in the self - consistent version of the ffs theory  @xcite , demonstrating that initially migdal may have been too pessimistic concerning the possibility to use the same interaction for ground state properties and for low - lying excited states .    in deriving the hf or hfb equations , the starting point is the minimization of the expectation value of the energy , expressed by an effective interaction .",
    "the latter is considered as a substitute for the @xmath1-matrix derived from the true nn interaction , appearing in some kind of `` effective hamiltonian '' .",
    "therefore , ideally , the same interaction should be used in the pp ( hh ) and the particle - hole ( ph ) channel .",
    "the energy is then obtained from the interaction and the state vector which is assumed to be a slater determinant .",
    "the self - consistent ffs theory or energy density functional ( edf ) method starts from relations between the total energy , expressed as a functional of the density , the single particle potential , the effective interaction , and the quasiparticle density : instead of parameterizing the interaction and deriving the energy from it in a certain approximation , an ansatz for the energy functional is assumed from which the other quantities can be derived .",
    "the interaction in the pp ( hh ) channel is obtained from the energy functional by a different procedure than that in the ph channel , and therefore these two interactions are different , which is of great practical importance .",
    "this feature is shared with migdal s theory of finite fermi systems .",
    "otherwise , from a technical point of view , there is little difference between the edf method and the hf or , with pairing , hfb method .",
    "the latter correspond to special choices of the energy functional . on the other hand in the edf method , to compute the density , a slater determinant or hfb - type state vector is employed .",
    "thus the differences which exist in principle , due to the necessary approximations are of little practical importance .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite the edf method has been applied to magic nuclei @xmath2ca and @xmath3pb , investigating especially the influence of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction on collective states .",
    "besides demonstrating the importance of including the two - body spin orbit force for the consistency of the method in describing the excited states , with the chosen set of parameters good results on the ground state properties have been obtained .    here",
    "an analogous edf approach is applied to open - shell nuclei with special attention to the pairing part of the functional .",
    "first results obtained mainly in diagonal - pairing approximation ( i.e. with a hf ",
    "bcs formalism ) have already been given in a few short publications  @xcite ( the paper  @xcite gives the first application of the edf approach to deformed nuclei and contains the results of a hfb - type calculation for dysprosium isotopes ) .",
    "in the present paper we give the results of more elaborate calculations based on the coordinate - space technique developed in  @xcite which allows us , for a local pairing field @xmath4 , to solve the gorkov equations in spherical finite systems without any approximations  @xcite .",
    "the latter approach , even in the case of contact pairing force , corresponds , to a good approximation as will be shown in the present paper , to a full treatment of the hfb problem by applying the general variational principle to the edf with a fixed energy cutoff @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the fermi energy ) .",
    "it is known from nuclear matter calculations that @xmath7-wave pairing vanishes at or slightly above the equilibrium density @xmath8  @xmath9 ; and so , in our local edf approach , the cutoff is chosen to be larger than the corresponding fermi energy @xmath10  mev . in actual calculations",
    "we shall use @xmath11  mev .",

    "is described . in section  [ spair ]",
    "the pairing part of the functional is presented . there , a possible extrapolation to uniform nuclear matter and the dilute limit with weak and strong pairing is also considered .",
    "section  [ disres ] is devoted to the analysis of specific numerical results for a few isotopic chains of spherical nuclei and to the comparison of these results with experimental observations and other theoretical approaches .",

    "let us first briefly mention a few approaches used to calculate the nuclear ground state energy which is the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath12 ( with a `` bare '' nn - interaction ) over the exact ground state vector @xmath13 : @xmath14 in general , the vector @xmath13 is a functional of the particle density @xmath15  @xcite given by @xmath16 where @xmath7 and @xmath17 are the spin and isospin indices and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the particle creation and annihilation operators , respectively , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the energy is a functional of @xmath15 : @xmath21\\,.\\ ] ] it is a difficult problem to construct such a functional and calculate the energy for many body systems .",
    "formally , one can introduce single - particle degrees of freedom and , assuming that there is no pairing condensate , extract the single - particle motion on the hf level by writing is meaningless since @xmath22 becomes infinite due to the repulsive core .",
    "it is understood then that , for the first term in  ( [ ehf ] ) , the @xmath12 is taken with some kind of microscopically derived effective interaction , for example with the brueckner @xmath1-matrix ( see , e.g. , the discussion in  @xcite ) . because of inevitable approximations , such a replacement would never lead to the vanishing of the second term , @xmath23 . ]",
    "@xmath24 = \\langle{\\rm hf}\\vert{\\hat h}\\vert{\\rm hf}\\rangle + e_{\\rm corr}[\\hat \\rho]\\ , , \\label{ehf}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the hf vacuum  a slater determinant of single - particle wave functions @xmath26 .",
    "the latter are defined in a self - consistent manner by the equation @xmath27 in which the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath28 is given by the variational derivative of the energy functional with respect to the single - particle density matrix @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "the second term , @xmath23 , is the dynamical correlation energy ( short range correlations , rpa correlations , many - particle correlations , parquet diagrams , etc . ) .",
    "the density matrix @xmath29 may be associated with the landau - migdal quasiparticle density matrix defined as @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) the quasiparticle creation ( annihilation ) operators .",
    "it is in turn a functional of the particle density @xmath15 : @xmath34\\,.\\ ] ] in homogeneous infinite nuclear matter , because of equality of the particle and quasiparticle numbers , the following relation between the two densities holds : @xmath35 in an inhomogeneous system , the local difference between the densities could be attributed to the quasiparticle form factor  @xcite . using the effective radius approximation",
    "one may write @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the effective quasiparticle radius .",
    "hence the mean square nuclear radius for the particles may differ from that for the quasiparticles : @xmath38 some additional effects may be related with a possible change of the internal structure of nucleons in nuclear medium .",
    "such effects are not included explicitly in the ordinary approaches , based either on a  bare \" hamiltonian @xmath39 or on some kind of effective interaction , in which the nucleons or quasiparticles are considered as point - like objects . within the edf approach , however , tracing back to the hohenberg ",
    "kohn density - functional theory  @xcite , if the functional were known , its minimization would determine both the ground - state energy and the correct particle density @xmath40 . anyway , for the differences between mean square radii of nuclei , which is of our main interest here , one has @xmath41",
    "the common problem of any many - body theory is how to calculate the dynamical correlation energy @xmath23 or how to take it into account in some effective way . in nuclear physics",
    "a few self - consistent methods are very popular :    * the hf method with effective density - dependent interaction ( e.g. , with zero - range skyrme  @xcite or finite - range gogny force  @xcite ) . in this method",
    "the energy is calculated as a ground state expectation value of an effective hamiltonian @xmath42 taken over a slater determinant , @xmath24 = \\langle{\\rm hf}\\vert{\\hat h}_{\\rm eff}\\vert{\\rm hf}\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ]    * the relativistic mean field model  @xcite based on a phenomenological relativistic lagrangian which includes mesonic and nucleonic degrees of freedom . in most applications to the ground states of finite nuclei , the relativistic hartree formalism with static meson fields , and with no - sea approximation for nucleons , has been used ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    * the quasiparticle lagrangian method ( qlm ) which is an extension  @xcite of the landau - migdal quasiparticle concept . in this method",
    "an effective local quasiparticle lagrangian is constructed taking into account the first - order energy - dependence of the nucleon mass operator and the requirements imposed by self - consistency relations  @xcite .",
    "the qlm can be reformulated in terms of an effective hamiltonian  @xcite in which the ( linear ) energy dependence of the nucleon mass operator is completely hidden so that this approach becomes equivalent to the edf method ( see also the discussion of this point in  @xcite ) .    * the method of the effective quasiparticle local energy density functional ( which is referred to as edf here ) .",
    "the possibility to use this method is based on the existence theorem of hohenberg and kohn  @xcite . with the kohn - sham quasiparticle formalism",
    "@xcite , this theorem allows one to write the nuclear edf in the form @xmath24 = { \\rm tr}(t\\hat\\rho ) + e_{\\rm int}[\\rho]\\,,\\ ] ] where the first term is taken with the free kinetic energy operator @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the bare nucleon mass ) .",
    "the ground state energy is then determined by making this edf stationary with respect to infinitesimal variations of the single - particle wave functions belonging to the class of the slater determinants from which the density matrix @xmath29 ( and the density @xmath45 ) can be calculated self - consistently .",
    "this method is flexible in the sense that the edf does not ( and should not ) expose the same symmetry properties for the effective force , which is the second variational derivative of the edf with respect to @xmath45 , as the underlying bare nn interaction or effective skyrme - type forces .",
    "particularly , the force in the ph channel obtained from the edf does not come out to be antisymmetrized , and the effective force in the pp channel needed for describing the nuclear pairing properties has to be derived in a different way . as a result ,",
    "the matrix elements of the pp force , although they should be antisymmetrized , have no direct connection , say by means of simple angular momentum recoupling like the pandya transformation , with those of the ph force such that @xmath46 . ] .",
    "this is , as discussed in the introduction , in accord with the philosophy of migdal theory of finite fermi systems  @xcite .",
    "( for an example of the phenomenological nuclear edf see  @xcite ) .    in most of the applications of the conventional functionals to finite nuclei",
    "the pairing correlations are introduced either at the bcs or the hfb level ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when the contact pairing interaction is used , the pairing part of the functional is usually evaluated within a truncated space of the quasiparticle levels imposing an energy cutoff which is often chosen with some freedom but not too far from the fermi surface .",
    "a more rigorous approach should be based on the general variational principle for the cutoff functional which uses the same quasiparticle basis both in the ph and pp channel .",
    "we proceed as follows . in nuclei with pairing correlations",
    "one works with approximate state vectors which are not eigenstates of the particle number .",
    "one assumes nonzero anomalous expectation values , @xmath47 , and the energy of a superfluid nucleus may be given by a functional of the generalized density matrix @xmath48 containing both normal , @xmath29 , and anomalous , @xmath49 , components ( see appendix a ) .",

    "the major difficulty in implementing this general variational principle in practice is connected with the anomalous part of the energy functional .",

    "in general , the gap equation , @xmath69 is nonlocal and its solution ( starting , for example , from a realistic bare nn interaction  @xcite ) , even for uniform nuclear matter , poses serious problems .",
    "first attempts were made very recently to construct an effective pairing interaction for semi - infinite nuclear matter  @xcite and for finite nuclei  @xcite with an approximate version of the brueckner approach .",
    "those studies are in an initial stage , and so far they do not give any guidance how to choose an effective pairing interaction , in particular its density dependence , that could be used in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "it is assumed that a simple universal effective interaction in the pp - channel can be invented to correctly describe the nuclear pairing properties .",
    "our intention is to show that , to a good approximation in the case of weak pairing @xmath57 , the edf method and the general variational principle can be used with an effective density - dependent contact pp - interaction .",
    "we proceed with the formal development by using the green s function formalism as described in detail in appendices a and b. here we give only a brief account of the main issues .",
    "we introduce an arbitrary cutoff @xmath70 in the energy space , but such that @xmath5 , and split the generalized density matrix into two parts , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is related to the integration over energies @xmath73 .",
    "the gap equation is renormalized to yield @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the cutoff anomalous density matrix and @xmath76 is the effective antisymmetrized pp - interaction in which the contribution coming from the energy region @xmath73 far from the fermi surface is included by renormalization ( see appendix a ) .    for homogeneous infinite matter with weak pairing ( @xmath77 ) , it is shown that the variational functional @xmath78 does not change in first order in @xmath79 upon variation with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "the total energy of the system and the chemical potential also remain the same in first order in @xmath79 if one imposes the particle number constraint  ( [ consn ] ) for the cutoff functional . to a good approximation ,",
    "as discussed in appendix a , this should also be valid for finite ( heavy ) nuclei .",
    "such an outcome may be understood by noting that the major pairing effects , if @xmath57 which is generally the case in nuclear matter and in finite nuclei , are developed near the fermi surface .",
    "in this connection we mention the well - known fact that the pairing energy , in the bcs approximation , is defined by a sum concentrated near the fermi surface ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath80 with @xmath81 the average level density and @xmath0 the average energy gap in the vicinity of the fermi surface . in infinite matter",
    ", this corresponds to the pairing energy per particle ( see appendix b ) : @xmath82 it follows that , with the cutoff functional , this leading pairing contribution to the energy of the system is exactly accounted for .",
    "thus we find that nuclear ground state properties can be described by applying the general variational principle to minimize the cutoff functional which has exactly the same form as in eq .",
