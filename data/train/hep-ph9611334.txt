    "the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electroweak interactions , based on the gauge group @xmath2 , has been extremely successful phenomenologically .",

    "it is being tested at the level of a few tenths of a percent , both at very low energies and at high energies  @xcite , and has correctly predicted the range of the top quark mass from loop corrections .",
    "however , the sm has a number of shortcomings .",
    "in particular , it does not explain the origin of mass , the observed hierarchical pattern of fermion masses , and why there are three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "it is widely believed that at high energies , or in very high precision measurements , deviations from the sm will appear , signaling the presence of new physics .    in this report",
    "we discuss the prospects for precision tests of the standard model at future collider experiments , focussing on electroweak measurements .",
    "the goal of these measurements is to confront the sm predictions with experiment , and to derive indirect information on the mass of the higgs boson .",

    "another uncertainty that will not , and has not in the past , scaled with luminosity is the theoretical uncertainty coming from the @xmath171 model and the uncertainty on the proton structure .",

    "was varied .",
    "the constraint on this parameter was provided by the measurement of the @xmath173 spectrum .",
    "the uncertainty due to parton distribution functions and the @xmath171 input spectrum was then assessed by varying simultaneously the parton distribution function , as determined by varying the measured @xmath0 charge asymmetry , and the parameter describing the non - perturbative part of the @xmath171 spectrum .",
    "the cdf experiment uses their measurement of the @xmath0 charge asymmetry as the sole constraint on the uncertainty due to the parton distribution functions . figure  [ fig : fourteen ]",

    "the fitted @xmath0 mass is seen to be strongly correlated with the @xmath0 charge asymmetry .",

    "moreover , the measurements of the @xmath0 charge asymmetry , together with measurements from deep inelastic scattering experiments , will provide further constraints on the parton distribution functions .",
    "an effort needs to be made , though , to provide the experiments with parton distributions with associated uncertainties .    at high luminosities alternate methods to determine the @xmath0-mass may be advantageous . because of the similarity of @xmath0 and @xmath3 production , methods based on ratios of relevant quantities , such as the charged lepton transverse momenta are particularly interesting  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the lepton @xmath169 distributions is thought to be very promising for fitting the @xmath0 mass in the high luminosity regime since the procedure is independent of many resolution effects .",
    "however , the shapes of the lepton transverse momentum distributions are sensitive to the differences in the @xmath0 and @xmath3 production mechanisms , which need to be better understood .    here",
    "we concentrate on a similar method which utilizes the transverse mass ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath3 bosons  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from an analysis of the transverse mass ratio have recently been presented by the d  collaboration  @xcite .",
    "only the electron channel will be discussed in the following , although the method is expected to work for muon final states as well .",
    "the transverse mass ratio method treats the @xmath177 sample similar to the @xmath178 sample , thus cancelling many of the common systematic uncertainties .",
    "a transverse mass for the @xmath3 boson is constructed with one of the decay electrons , while the @xmath179 is derived by adding the transverse energy of the other electron to the residual @xmath179 in the event .",
    "hence , two such combinations can be formed for each @xmath3 event .",

    "the @xmath0 mass is then determined from the scale factor @xmath180 which gives the best agreement between the @xmath147 distributions using a kolmogorov test . since differences in the production mechanism , acceptances and resolution effects between the @xmath0 and the @xmath3 sample lead to differences in the shapes of the transverse mass distributions",
    ", one has to correct for these effects .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty arises from the uncertainty on the underlying event .",
    "electromagnetic and hadronic resolution effects mostly cancel in the transverse mass ratio , as expected . the systematic uncertainty due to the and the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 boson is reduced by more than a factor  3 compared with that found using the conventional @xmath0 transverse mass method  @xcite .",
    "the total systematic error from the drun  ia data sample is estimated to be 75  mev / c@xmath11 .",

    "@xmath0 candidates are selected by requiring @xmath181  gev / c and @xmath182  gev / c , while electrons from @xmath3 decays are required to have @xmath183  gev / c , since they are eventually scaled down .",
