    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) has filamentary structure over scales ranging from hundreds of parsecs through aus .",
    "this paper will analyze some of the properties of h  ii regions formed by ionization of the clumpy interstellar gas and compare them to those produced by the same code for models with a spatially uniform density .",
    "the monte carlo photoionization code @xcite treats gas with densities that have a power - law or scale - independent character over about an order of magnitude in spatial sizes ( see  2 ) .",
    "we refer to these hierarchical models as  clumped \" .",
    "our goal is to isolate the effects of clumping by comparing clumped models with smooth density distributions , while keeping other important parameters ( e.g. , the stellar atmospheres and luminosities that strongly influence the nebular models , and the nebular composition ) constant .",
    "we choose the other parameters rather arbitrarily and do not try to compare our models with real objects .",
    "several types of questions motivate us :    ( @xmath7 ) for a fixed exciting star and mean nebular density , how are the ionization and temperature structures of the resulting ionized nebulae affected ?",
    "what are the physical causes of the differences",
    "? how do the differences vary as the nebular parameters ( e.g. , exciting star properties , geometry of the clumps , and the mean gas density ) are changed ?",
    "( @xmath8 ) how accurately are model ionic abundances determined from the emission lines , using techniques similar to those commonly used to analyze observations of real nebulae ? what errors occur in the ionic abundances derived from ratios of fluxes of emission lines , using mean nebular electron temperatures , @xmath9 , estimated from diagnostic line ratios ?",
    "we assume idealized conditions , neglecting observational errors and reddening of emission lines by interstellar dust either within or exterior to the hii region .",
    "thus , our abundance errors are lower limits to those expected for real nebulae .",
    "we consider the effects of dust in the transfer of lyman continuum radiation within the ionized gas .",
    "our assumptions and the limits of parameter space that we explored are given in  2 . in ",
    "3  we consider the physical differences among the clumped models and their differences from uniform models . in  4 , we discuss the relevance of our models to real nebulae and the uncertainties of abundances within them .",
    "we do not address the important issue of differences in abundances of many ions derived from recombination lines as opposed to collisionally excited lines .",
    "a common explanation is that there are `` anomalous '' temperature variations within the ionized plasma ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , although the phenomenon seems more complicated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have used only standard physics , and our abundances from recombination lines would be almost the same as from collisionally excited lines .",
    "there are many free parameters that affect the spectrum and abundances derived from model h  ii regions , and we consider only a subset of possible parameter space .",
    "we make the following assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "the models are in a steady state , thereby neglecting the dynamics occurring near the outer h@xmath10 ionization front , where probably a d - type front ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is propagating into the surrounding neutral material .",
    "this is the standard assumption in h  ii region models .",
    "however , the conditions near the ionization front are important for n@xmath3 and o@xmath3 , which are sensitive to the temperature and ionization structure at the outer edge of the ionized region .    \\2 .",
    "we chose the composition used for workshops for testing model h  ii regions ( @xcite , @xcite ) : h , he , c , n , o , ne , and s = 1 , 0.1 , 2.210@xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively , by number .",
    "these abundances are rather arbitrary , but are adequate for investigating the important physical effects introduced by clumping .",
    "we will refer to elemental abundances as chemical symbols without superscripts , so that ( o / h ) is the abundance ratio of o , including all stages of ionization , relative to h.    \\3 .",
    "dust in hii regions and within the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) needs careful consideration",
    ". we will show below that carbonaceous grain material has probably largely been converted to the gas phase .",
    "we will find that the effects of carbon - depleted dust are not very significant , but that with other assumptions dust could become dominant in determining the structure of the ionized region .",
    "dust affects the emitted nebular spectrum by reddening the nebular radiation and also by absorbing ionizing radiation . since corrections for reddening are routinely made , we assume that line strengths are determined perfectly .",
    "this assumption is very optimistic when we consider the spatially unresolved emission line fluxes rather than the pixel - by - pixel line intensities ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "if there were no destruction of dust within the ionized zone , the absorption of ionizing radiation by dust would be hugely important , while dust scattering , strongly directed forward , has almost no effect . the absorption cross section of graphitic carbon , closely related to absorption by polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , peaks at about 17  ev with a cross section of @xmath13 @xmath14 ( h atom)@xmath2 according to the model of @xcite , with the cross sections conveniently tabulated in @xcite .",
    "this exceeds the opacity of h if ( h@xmath3/h)@xmath15 , which occurs over most of the volume of the nebula .",
    "dust with this carbonaceous cross sections absorbs @xmath690% of the ionizing radiation over our entire range of models , for all geometries .",
    "by contrast , the silicate component of dust is relatively gray in the ionizing uv , with an opacity of roughly @xmath16 @xmath14 h@xmath2 , only 5% of the peak of carbonaceous dust .",
    "the abundance of dust in hii regions can be estimated by means of the gas - phase abundances of refractory elements ( e.g. , c , al , mg , ca , or fe ; see @xcite ) that are mostly locked up in dust in the diffuse ism .",
    "abundances found in bright hii regions are significantly different , especially for c. in the diffuse _ neutral _",
    "ism , the cii abundances derived from absorption towards 12 b stars is c / h = 160@xmath1717 ppm and an upper limit of 108 ppm for another @xcite . in various hii regions ,",
    "gas phase c / h varies from 330 to 590 ppm ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "solar ( c / h ) = 245@xmath1730 ppm ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "interstellar abundances have probably been significantly enhanced since the formation of the sun , perhaps dex(0.2 ) to @xmath6400 ppm ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the orion bar @xcite , an ionization front seen edge - on , shows 3.3 @xmath18 m aromatic hydrocarbon emission arising from a rather thin zone between the p@xmath19 and br@xmath19 recombination lines of h and emission lines of h@xmath20 .",
    "thus , several observations require that bright hii regions have most or almost all of their carbon in the gas phase .",
    "usually hii regions have strong near - infrared emission bands , but it may be that the carriers are actually in the neutral gas adjacent to the ionized .    in some hii regions ,",
    "silicaceous dust is present within the ionized gas . in m17 , only about 15% of the fe is in the gas phase @xcite . within the dig",
    ", @xcite found that aliii / siii is much less than solar .",
    "both ions are found only in the gas in which h is ionized , so al is depleted onto grains in the dig . further direct evidence for dust within the dig is given by the correlation of the diffuse h@xmath19 with 100 @xmath18 m emission and the lack of correlation with hi @xcite .    in summary",
    ", it seems that the carbonaceous component of dust has largely been vaporized in hii regions while the silicaceous grains may largely remain intact .",
    "perhaps processes that convert carbon in grains to the gas phase act very rapidly in ionized gas , so that the c in dust ( including pahs and the `` very small grains , '' carbonaceous in character ) does not absorb ionizing radiation when h is mostly h@xmath4 .",
    "pure silicate dust has cross sections so low and so weakly dependent on wavelength that its presence is not crucial to the results of this paper .",
    "we ran models that confirmed this statements , but for most models in this paper we neglected dust and also heating by pahs .",
    "our algorithm for clumping was not derived from any model of turbulence , but rather from hierarchically clumped models of the density distributions in the manner described in @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "points were placed within a cube as described below .",
    "the cube was partitioned into 65@xmath21 cells , and the final gas density within each of the cells was proportional to the number of points falling within the cell .",
    "the exciting star was placed at the center of the cube .",
    "initially 32 points were cast randomly throughout the cube . surrounding each of these another 32 points",
    "were cast randomly within a distance determined by the `` fractal dimension '' , @xmath22 , of the model ( see @xcite for details ) . around each of these points",
    "another 32 were nested , and finally 32 more around each of the preceding round of casting .",
    "thus , the structure , if it were continued indefinitely , would be considered `` fractal '' , but the power spectrum is a power law only over about a decade in sizes of projected densities .",
    "the mean density was taken to be @xmath23(h ) = 100 @xmath24 , with a fraction @xmath25 in a uniform distribution and the rest in the clumped cells .",
    "the @xmath25 represents an average over a still finer distribution of subclumps , not spatially resolved in our simulation , that extend down to very small scales .    for this paper we chose @xmath25 = 0.15 ,",
    "so the minimum density of a cell is 15 @xmath24 .",
    "the maximum density within these models was 2700 @xmath24 , with a spread of @xmath1715% arising from different initial seeds .",
    "for comparison to the clumped geometries , uniform models were computed with the same stellar luminosity and @xmath23(h ) = 100 @xmath24 .",
    "the uniform models fitted more compactly into the grid cube and consequently could employ a mesh 2.7 times finer than the clumped models .",
    "the abundance patterns found with the coarse and finer resolution uniform models are in close agreement except for o@xmath3 ( the coarse being 1.5  2.2 times larger ) .    in order to test the effects of allowing radiation to escape from our clumped models through vacuum instead of unresolved cells , we ran models with @xmath25 = 0 .",
    "about 10% of the ionizing photons escaped the simulation , as opposed to @xmath61.5% for the @xmath26 = 0.15 models .",
    "the distribution of the density in the clumped models is determined by three parameters : ( @xmath27 ) @xmath25 , ( @xmath28 ) the initial seed for the random number generator , and ( @xmath29 ) the  fractal dimension \" , @xmath22 , that determines the power spectrum of column densities as projected from an assumed cube onto the plane of the sky .",
    "we considered @xmath22 = 2.6 and 2.9 , and averaged all clumped models among the same five arbitrarily chosen initial seeds .",
    "thus , we have an indication of the dispersion of various physical quantities among clumpy models with the same fractal dimension .",
    "the h - ionizing photon luminosity of the exciting star in units of 10@xmath30 photons s@xmath2 , @xmath31 , was increased from 0.1 to 100 , in steps of factors of ten . for uniform models",
    "this is equivalent to changing the  ionization parameter \" , @xmath32 @xmath33 , by factors of 10@xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the strmgren radius and @xmath36 the electron density . ) a large @xmath32 implies large abundances of high stages of ionization and a relatively sharp increase of ( h@xmath3/h ) near the edge of the strmgren sphere . in clumped models",
    "the ionized region is not spherical and there is no constant value of @xmath36 , but @xmath31 is an equivalent parameter to explore the effects represented by @xmath32 in uniform models .",
    "for instance , our results are applicable to superstar clusters : @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath24 in starburst galaxies .",
    "the dielectronic recombination coefficients for sulfur are poorly known .",
    "unfortunately , they can be important for the ionization of s. we followed @xcite , using averages of various ions of c , n , and o. we tested the importance of these assumptions by calculating some models with all dielectronic recombinations for s being zero .",
    "of course this is an extreme assumption , since a lack of knowledge of the values of coefficients does not imply that they are zero .",
    "we discuss the results in  [ sul ] .",
    "the cube for clumped models was large enough so that @xmath391% of the ionizing radiation escaped through the edges .",
    "the outer boundaries of the ionized regions were very irregular in shape , and for all stellar temperatures there are a few regions of neutral h and he embedded within the ionized gas , with the gas that they shadow from the star ionized by recombination radiation .",
    "our cell sizes are large in comparison to the mean free paths of ionizing photons when h is almost neutral within the cell .",
    "our code derives a mean ionization for the cell based on the radiation entering it without considering any substructure of the ionization within the cell .",
    "our analysis attributes that ionization to the entire mass of the cell , while only a fraction of the cell s mass would actually be involved . near the edge , a few photons can produce ionizations that the code assumes are spread uniformly over the entire cell , with a correspondingly low electron density .",
    "therefore , recombinations are underestimated , and too much mass of ionized material is derived . the principal ions for which this effect occurs are h@xmath4 , n@xmath3 , and o@xmath3 . in our analysis",
    "we considered only cells in which the code derived ( h@xmath4/h ) less than h@xmath40 , a parameter taken to be 0.25 for the results in this paper .",
    "this choice provides roughly an optical depth of unity across our cells , for a typical photon that can reach the edge . we have investigated how these results depend the h@xmath40 .",
    "uniform models are hardly affected because the area of their almost - neutral h zone is much smaller than clumped models .",
    "these show a slow decline in ( he@xmath4/h@xmath4 ) as h@xmath40 is increased from 0.1 to 0.4 , and a more rapid drop from 0.4 to 0.9 .",
    "the increase of @xmath23(h@xmath3)/@xmath23(h ) between adjacent cells is typically an order of magnitude when the larger ( h@xmath3/h ) is 0.4 or more .",
    "we kept the number of cells within the model cube constant and varied the physical length of the cube proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "this makes clumped models with the same initial seed have the same ionization structure in terms of the size of the model cube .",
    "[ panels ] shows ( @xmath27 ; upper left ) the clumped gas densities in a typical slice through the plane containing the star ; ( @xmath28 ; upper right ) the fraction of h@xmath3 in the same slice , ( @xmath29 ; lower left ) the intensities of h@xmath19 , relative to its maximum intensity , as projected onto the sky ( with no foreground extinction ) , and ( @xmath42 ; lower right ) the [ nii]/h@xmath19 ratio projected onto the sky .",
    "the axes are in parsecs for a model with @xmath43 = 40 kk , @xmath31 = 10 .",
    "we see that the density through the midplane is concentrated to the left side , but the projected images , ( @xmath29 ) and ( @xmath42 ) , are more symmetrical because of ionization in the foreground and background planes .",
    "the [ nii]/h@xmath19 is large at the edge because the ionization favors n@xmath4 and the temperature is relatively high there .    the large [ nii]/h@xmath19 ( lower right panel ) at the edges does not imply that the hii region would appear limb - brightened in the sky .",
    "the lower left panel shows that the h@xmath19 intensity at the edges is only @xmath61% as bright as the maximum , so the [ nii ] intensity is low and would blend in with the unrelated surrounding diffuse emission .",
    "it is only the [ nii]/h@xmath19 _ ratio _ that increases at the edges .",
    "our results from a large number of models can be summarized simply : for a given exciting star , clumping changes the averaged fraction of ionization of all elements , but differently for relatively cool stars than for hot .",
    "the important quantity is @xmath44(he / h ) .",
    "if @xmath45 a star is `` hot '' ; @xmath46 , `` cool . ''",
    "clumping enhances the higher stages of ionization of an element ( including he ) for cool stars and decreases them for hot .",
    "the amounts of enhancement for specific ions are discussed below .",
    "we have @xmath47 , integrated from the ionization potential of he@xmath3 , @xmath48(he@xmath3 ) = 24.6 ev , to @xmath48(he@xmath4 ) = 54 ev .",
    "@xmath49 is @xmath50 , integrated from 13.6 ev to 54 ev .",
    "we count the radiation above 24.6 ev as both h- and he - ionizing because each recombination of he produces about one h - ionizing photon @xcite , so absorptions by he hardly affect the number of h - ionizing photons .",
    "interstellar dust does not affect the distribution of ionization significantly if it contains only silicates , as seems likely ( see  [ assumpt ] ) .",
    "there are a large number of parameters in our models .",
    "some set the basic physics and radiative transfer ( elemental abundances , @xmath43 , @xmath31 , and @xmath25 ) , but others are arbitrary : the fractal dimension , @xmath22 , and the initial seed that determines the density structure in clumped models .",
    "the dispersion of the results among the five initial seeds that we arbitrarily chose for each clumped model is not large .",
    "typical variations of ( h@xmath4/h ) are 0.1% ; of ( he@xmath3/he ) , 0.2% if ( he@xmath3/he ) @xmath51 0.1 and @xmath522% if ( he@xmath3/he)@xmath6 0.3 .",
    "the mean temperatures weighted by @xmath53h@xmath4 ) vary @xmath60.5% . varying @xmath22 from 2.6 to 2.9 produced changes about twice the dispersion among the various seeds of each clumped model .",
    "the overall result is that the other parameters were much more influential than @xmath22 and the initial seed . for the rest of the paper",
    ", we will present @xmath22 = 2.6 results as representing clumped models , with results averaged among the five seeds .",
    "we begin by considering the main physical difference between clumped and uniform models , then define averaged abundances for comparing models , and then consider specific elements and ions .",
    "the most important consequence of a clumped density distribution is the fate of he ionizing radiation , depending upon the hardness of the stellar radiation .",
    "it determines the relative amounts of the nebular opacity supplied by h and he , the two big players for almost all ionizing photons .",
    "hot stars produce bountiful he - ionizing photons , so h can compete with he for he - ionizing radiation . at @xmath54",
    "= 25 ev , just above @xmath48(he@xmath3 ) , h contributes @xmath640% of the opacity near the star with @xmath43 = 45 kk , and he practically all of the rest . in a uniform model ,",
    "the fraction of h opacity gradually falls with distance from the star as he becomes more neutral . in the interclump regions of clumped models , the h opacity decreases less rapidly with distance because the density is lower .",
    "the abrupt increase of density when stellar photons encounter a clump makes the increase of he opacity over h occur within a small volume .",
    "the overall effect is to make h compete for he - ionizing radiation more effectively in clumped models than in smooth , thereby decreasing ( he@xmath4/he ) and other high stages of ionization over uniform models .",
    "he supplies 95% of the opacity for 25 ev photons when @xmath43 = 37.5 kk . in this case , in clumped models the he is ionized in the interclump medium until the outflowing starlight encounters a clump , at which point both h and he tend to become neutral . in a uniform model , the he goes neutral after it absorbs essentially all of the stellar he - ionizing radiation .",
    "and there is a substantial region in which h is still h@xmath4 but he is neutral .",
    "the overall effect is that he and h tend to be both ionized within the same volume in clumped models , so the ( he+/he ) within the ionized region is larger than in uniform models .",
    "the same effect applies to other high stages of ionization .",
    "_ this is the major physical cause of differences between clumpy and smooth models . _",
    "we compared clumped models with those with uniform densities , but the root physical causes of the differences lie in the radial symmetry , not the uniformity , of the uniform models .",
    "the general distinctions between clumped and uniform models applies to any smooth distribution of gas density .",
    "we considered @xcite stellar atmospheres of ( 37.5 , 40 , 42.5 , and 45 ) kk , log @xmath55 = 4 and used a power - law interpolation between them to estimate spectra for 38.1 , 38.7 , and 41 kk as well .",
    "for these atmospheres , @xmath56 occurs at about 39.1 kk .",
    "we will see qualitative differences in the ionization structure for other elements at this @xmath43 . for kurucz atmospheres , @xmath57 = ( 0.569 , 1.35 , 2.41 ) for @xmath43 = ( 37.5 , 40 , 45 ) kk .",
    "we present plots of ionization fractions vs. @xmath43 because @xmath57 , the real independent variable , is a less familiar quantity .",
    "our aim is to compare the abundances within our clumped models with the abundances that would be inferred if the emissions from the models , measured without error or dust , were interpreted in the ways used on actual nebulae .",
    "the derived abundances differ from the actual ones in the model because of temperature and density variations within the model , even if the density is never enough to de - excite the emission lines by collisions .",
    "if there is poor spatial resolution , there is averaging over the face of the nebula as well .",
    "we will compare three types of averaged abundances of a particular ion , @xmath58 , relative to h. the line emission ( photons @xmath24s@xmath2ster@xmath2 ) is @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is presumed to be known from atomic theory .",
    "since the model provides 3-d ionization structure of the nebula , the true abundances are known :    @xmath61    an observer would know the projected line intensities , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the distance along the line of sight , averaged over the observer s spatial resolution .",
    "an extreme assumption would be that there is no spatial resolution over the face of the nebula , so that we know only the total line fluxes , @xmath64 , thereby obtaining a `` global '' averaged abundance : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the measured averaged temperature relevant to the ion @xmath58 , depending upon whether it is a high or low stage .",
    "the weights @xmath67 , and similarly for the h lines . for high ions we use @xmath5([oiii ] ) , obtained from [ oiii]@xmath684363/(5007 + 4859 ) . for low ions we use @xmath5([nii ] ) , from [ nii]@xmath695755/(6583 + 6548 ) .",
    "we will explore the effects of the @xmath70 on the derived abundances .",
    "note that the effect is not limited to variations in temperature : it exists even in artificial isothermal models because of variations in @xmath36 .",
    "another extreme assumption is that ( @xmath58/h ) can be determined at each point ( @xmath71 ) , and the result , @xmath72 , then averaged , weighting the bright pixels more than the faint .",
    "we define the abundances averaged over the face of the nebula by @xmath73    the fluctuations of temperature within our models are modest , as uniform and smooth models have previously suggested .",
    "the variation of @xmath5([oiii ] ) across the face of a nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is described by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the element of area on the sky and @xmath76 is the averaged temperature .",
    "@xcite found @xmath77 in the range 0.005  0.016 in five regions of the face of the orion nebula using hst images of @xmath694363 and 5007 with high spatial resolution . for @xmath43 = 40kk and @xmath31 = 10 ,",
    "our models collapsed along one axis yield @xmath78 = 0.0012 for the uniform model and @xmath79 for the clumped models with various initial seeds .",
    "for @xmath43 = 45 kk , @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the orion nebula shows temperature fluctuations in excess of models , but not enough to explain the discrepancies between collisionally excited and recombination lines unless one assumes that in real nebulae more violent fluctuations are averaged out by the integration along the line of sight .    we do not discuss fine structure lines ( [ oiii ] 52 , 88 @xmath18 m , plus several others ) because their emissivities are not sensitive to variations in temperature or densities within the rather modest ranges that we consider .",
