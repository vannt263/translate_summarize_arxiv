    "because planets are born in dusty circumstellar disks , the likelihood of planet formation around brown dwarfs relative to that among stars can be constrained in part by comparing the prevalence of disks between these two mass regimes . given the central role of disks in the star formation process , a comparison of disk fractions of brown dwarfs and stars also would help determine if they share common formation mechanisms .",
    "extensive work has been done in measuring disk fractions for stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which typically consists of infrared ( ir ) photometry of a significant fraction of a young stellar population and identification of the objects with excess emission indicative of cool , dusty disks .",
    "in recent years , this method of detecting disks has been applied to objects near and below the hydrogen burning mass limit using photometry at 2 - 3  @xcite , 4 - 15  @xcite , and millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , detections of disks with the data at 2 - 3  have been difficult because the emitting regions for these wavelengths become very small for disks around low - mass bodies .",
    "meanwhile , disk excesses are larger at longer wavelengths , but have been measured for only a small number of the brighter , more massive objects because of technological limitations . in comparison , because the _ spitzer space telescope _ is far more sensitive beyond 3  than any other existing facility and can survey large areas of sky , it can reliably and efficiently detect disks for brown dwarfs at very low masses @xcite and for large numbers of brown dwarfs in young clusters .    to capitalize on the unique capabilities of _ spitzer _ for measuring disk fractions , we have used the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to obtain mid - ir photometry for spectroscopically confirmed stellar and substellar members of the star - forming clusters ic  348 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and chamaeleon",
    "i ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter ,",
    "we describe these observations , identify the cluster members that exhibit mid - ir excesses indicative of dusty inner disks , compare the disk fractions of brown dwarfs and stars , and discuss the resulting implications for the formation mechanism of brown dwarfs and planet formation around brown dwarfs .",
    "as a part of the guaranteed time observations of the irac instrument team , we obtained images of ic  348 and chamaeleon  i at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  with irac on the _ spitzer space telescope_. we performed seven sets of observations : three large shallow maps of ic  348 and the northern and southern clusters in chamaeleon  i , one small deep map of ic  348 , two small deep maps of the southern cluster in chamaeleon  i , and a single position toward the low - mass binary 2mass  j11011926 - 7732383 on the southwestern edge of chamaeleon  i @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of these maps are summarized in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "further details of the observations and data reduction for ic  348 and the northern cluster of chamaeleon  i are provided by lada et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and @xcite , respectively .",
    "similar methods were used for the remaining maps in table  [ tab : log ] . for all data ,",
    "we have adopted zero point magnitudes ( @xmath8 ) of 19.670 , 18.921 , 16.855 , and 17.394 in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  bands , where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these values of @xmath8 differ slightly from those used for ots  44 by @xcite and for taurus by @xcite . in tables",
    "[ tab : ic348 ] and [ tab : cha ] , we list irac photometry for all known members of ic  348 and chamaeleon  i that are likely to be brown dwarfs ( @xmath0m6)m6.25 according to the models of @xcite and @xcite and the temperature scale of @xcite . ] and that are within our images .",
    "measurements for the earlier , stellar members of these clusters will be tabulated in forthcoming studies . an absent measurement in table  [ tab : ic348 ]",
    "indicates that the object was below the detection limit in that filter . because of the weaker background emission in chamaeleon  i , the detection limits are much better in that cluster , and all objects in table  [ tab : cha ] have extrapolated photospheric fluxes above the detection limits for all four bands .",
    "thus , an absent measurement in table  [ tab : cha ] indicates contamination by cosmic rays or a position beyond the map s field of view .",
    "to measure disk fractions in ic  348 and chamaeleon  i , we first define the samples of stars and brown dwarfs that will be used .",
    "we consider all known members of ic  348 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) and chamaeleon  i ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) that have measured spectral types of m0 or later ( @xmath10  @xmath2 ) and detections in our irac images .",
    "this spectral type range encompasses most of the known members of each cluster ( @xmath11% ) . because many of the known members of chamaeleon  i were originally discovered through the presence of signatures directly or indirectly related to disks ( ir excess , h@xmath12 emission ) , membership samples from earlier studies of the cluster are potentially biased toward objects with disks , which would preclude a meaningful disk fraction measurement .",
    "therefore , to ensure that we have an unbiased sample of members of chamaeleon  i , we include in our analysis the additional members discovered during a new magnitude - limited survey of the cluster ( luhman , in preparation ) photometry from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) and @xmath13 photometry from the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) .",
    "additional candidates at fainter levels were identified with deeper optical and near - ir images of smaller fields toward the northern and southern clusters .",
    "these candidates were then classified as field stars or members through followup spectroscopy .",
    "the resulting completeness was similar to that achieved on other surveys using the same methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . ] .",
    "finally , for the purposes of this work , we treat as members of ic  348 the two candidates from @xcite , sources 1050 and 2103 .",
    "the resulting samples for ic  348 and chamaeleon  i contain 246 and 109 objects , respectively .",
    "to identify objects with disks in the samples we have defined for ic  348 and chamaeleon  i , we use an irac color - color diagram consisting of [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] versus [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] .",
    "the dependence of these colors on extinction and spectral type is very small for the range of extinctions and types in question .",
    "most of the objects in our samples exhibit @xmath14 , which corresponds to @xmath15-[4.5])<0.04 $ ] and @xmath16-[5.8])<0.02 $ ] .",
    "the effect of spectral type on these colors was determined by computing the average colors as a function of spectral type of objects within the ( diskless ) clump of members near the origin in the color - color diagram of each cluster in figure  [ fig : quad ] .",
    "this analysis indicates that the intrinsic [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] can be fit by two linear relations between @xmath17-[4.5]=0.01 $ ] , 0.105 , and 0.13 at m0 , m4 , and m8 , respectively , while the [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] colors show no dependence on spectral type and have an average value of 0.06 . in comparison ,",
    "colors using bands shorter than [ 3.6 ] are more sensitive to extinction and spectral type , and thus are less attractive choices for this analysis .",
    "meanwhile , measurements at 8.0  are available for fewer objects than the three shorter irac bands , primarily because of the bright reflection nebulosity in ic  348 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : quad ] , we plot [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] versus [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] for the samples in ic  348 and chamaeleon  i. one of the two colors is unavailable for 24 and 18 objects ( 12 and 4 at @xmath0m6 ) in these samples , respectively , and thus are not shown .",
    "in addition to these samples of cluster members , we include in figure  [ fig : quad ] all objects in the irac images that have been classified as field stars in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which correspond to 81 and 99 stars toward ic  348 and chamaeleon  i , respectively .",
    "we use these field stars as diskless control samples to gauge the scatter in colors due to photometric errors .",
    "the scatter in the field stars toward chamaeleon  i is actually larger than that of the clump of members near the origin , probably because the field stars are more heavily weighted toward fainter levels .",
    "according to the distributions of [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] and [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] for the fields stars in figure  [ fig : quad ] , excesses greater than 0.1 in both colors represent a significant detection of disk emission",
    ". these color excesses also coincide with a natural break in the distribution of colors for members of taurus @xcite and chamaeleon  i ( figure  [ fig : quad ] ) . a break of this kind is present but less well - defined in ic  348 , probably because of the larger photometric errors caused by the brighter background emission .",
    "therefore , we used these color excess criteria to identify objects with disks among the members of chamaeleon  i and ic  348 in figure  [ fig : quad ] . to compute the color excesses of the cluster members , we adopted the intrinsic colors as a function of spectral type derived earlier in this section .",
    "this analysis produces disk fractions of 69/209 ( m0-m6 ) and 8/13 ( @xmath0m6 ) in ic  348 and 35/77 ( m0-m6 ) and 7/14 ( @xmath0m6 ) in chamaeleon  i. among the members that are not plotted in figure  [ fig : quad ] ( i.e. , lack photometry at 3.6 , 4.5 , or 5.8  ) , 4/11 and 2/11 in ic  348 and 6/14 and 2/4 in chamaeleon  i exhibit significant excesses in the other available colors ( e.g. , @xmath18-[4.5 ] , [ 4.5]-[8.0 ] ) , while sources 621 and 761 in ic  348 have uncertain irac measurements and therefore are excluded . after accounting for these additional objects , we arrive at disk fractions of 73/220=@xmath5% ( m0-m6 ) and 10/24=@xmath3% ( @xmath0m6 ) in ic  348 and 41/91=@xmath6% ( m0-m6 ) and 9/18=@xmath4% ( @xmath0m6 ) in chamaeleon  i.    disks with inner holes extending out to @xmath19  au can be undetected in the colors we have used , but they can have strong excess emission at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "for instance , source 316 in ic  348 exhibits excess emission at 8  but not in the shorter bands .",
    "thus , our measurements apply only to inner disks that are capable of producing significant excesses shortward of 6  and represent lower limits to the total disk fractions .",
    "we examine the implications of our brown dwarf disk fractions by first considering previous measurements of this kind in ic  348 and chamaeleon  i. using @xmath20 photometry , @xcite searched for evidence of disks among 53 objects in ic  348 , taurus , @xmath21  ori , chamaeleon  i , the tw hya association , upper scorpius , and ophiuchus , 27 of which are later than m6 . when sources at all spectral types were combined ( i.e. , both low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ) , the resulting disk fractions for individual clusters exhibited large statistical errors of @xmath22% .",
    "better statistics were possible for a sample combining chamaeleon  i , ic  348 , taurus , and u  sco , for which @xcite found a disk fraction of 40 - 60% . for the objects with types of @xmath23m6 , we find that the disk / no disk classifications of @xcite agree well with those based on our irac data .",
    "however , we find no excess emission in the irac colors for 2/3 objects later than m6 in ic  348 and chamaeleon  i ( cha  h@xmath12  7 and 12 ) that were reported to have disks by @xcite .",
    "an @xmath24-band survey similar to that of @xcite was performed by @xcite .",
    "they considered a sample of 7 and 32 late - type members of taurus and ic  348 , respectively , 12 of which have optical spectral types later than m6 @xcite . for their entire sample of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs",
    ", @xcite found a disk fraction of @xmath25% , which is a factor of two larger than our measurements for ic  348 . among the 28 members of ic  348 from the sample of @xcite for which [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] and [ 4.5]-[5.8 ]",
    "are available , only 11 objects show excesses in these colors . we find that 9/10 objects with @xmath26 in the data from @xcite do indeed exhibit significant excesses in the irac colors .",
    "however , the putative detections of disks with smaller @xmath24 excesses from @xcite are not confirmed by the irac measurements . because the color excess produced by a disk grows with increasing wavelengths , any bona fide detection of a disk at @xmath24",
    "would be easily verified in the irac data .",
    "our irac images of ic  348 and chamaeleon  i have produced the most accurate , statistically significant measurements to date of disk fractions for brown dwarfs ( @xmath0m6 ) .",
    "for both clusters , these measurements are consistent with the disk fractions exhibited by the stellar populations ( m0-m6 , 0.7  @xmath7  @xmath2 ) .",
    "these results support the notion that stars and brown dwarfs share a common formation history , but do not completely exclude some scenarios in which brown dwarfs form through a distinct mechanism @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the disk fractions of stars and brown dwarfs also indicates that the building blocks of planets are available around brown dwarfs as often as around stars .",
    "the relative ease with which planets arise from these building blocks around stars and brown dwarfs remains unknown .",
