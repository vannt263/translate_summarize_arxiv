    "coulomb drag @xcite occurs when driving a current through a metallic layer , referred to as the active layer ( and which will be denoted by @xmath2 ) , induces a current in another metallic layer , separated by a distance @xmath1 , referred to as the passive layer ( and which will be denoted by @xmath3 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is caused by the transference of momentum between electrons in different layers due to the interlayer electron - electron interaction . in experimental situations",
    "no current is allowed to flow in the passive layer , so that an electrical field , @xmath4 , builds up in that layer .",
    "in this situation , the drag resistivity , @xmath5 , is obtained from the ratio @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the current driven through the active layer .",
    "recently there has been great deal of interest on the phenomenon of coulomb drag in graphene double layers .",
    "although the number of experimental works on drag in graphene is still scarce @xcite , there are already plenty of theoretical works on the topic @xcite . however , among the theoretical literature we find contradictory statements , particularly in the limit of low temperature , high density , large layer separation and strong screening . in this limit",
    ", it is a well established result that the drag resistivity between two 2deg s ( two dimensional electron gases ) , with parabolic dispersion relations and a constant transport time , depends on temperature as @xmath8 and on the interlayer separation as @xmath0 @xcite ( a result previously given in @xcite without derivation ) .",
    "graphene is distinct from the 2deg in three ways : ( i ) the low energy dispersion relation is linear , instead of parabolic ; ( ii ) the electron wave function has a spinorial structure , instead of being a scalar ; ( iii ) the transport time for the dominant kind of impurities is proportional to the momentum , @xmath9 , @xcite .",
    "there is agreement @xcite that in the low temperature / high density limit , the @xmath10 dependence should still hold in graphene . however , there are a few contradictory results on the dependence of the drag resistivity on the layer separation , and how considering a constant or a momentum dependent transport time changes the result . in this paper",
    "we will give special attention to the limit of low temperature , high density , large interlayer separation and strong screening .",

    "it shows that in the limit of low temperature and high density , the non - linear susceptibility is independent of both the energy dispersion relation and the dependence of the transport time on momentum , depending only in the particular form of the overlap factor .",
    "therefore , this result can be readily applied for the case of a 2deg , graphene , bilayer graphene and other systems . although it was already pointed out in @xcite that the non - linear susceptibility is independent of the momentum dependence of the transport time , in those works this result was obtained for the particular case of massless dirac electrons . here",
    ", we show that this is a general result also independent of the energy dispersion relation . note",
    "that this result contradicts @xcite , where different results for the non - linear susceptibility are obtained for different transport times in the low temperature limit .    since in the low temperature limit",
    "we have @xmath74 , the integration in @xmath51 in reads @xmath75 which gives the @xmath8 dependence of the drag conductivity and resistivity in the low temperature limit .",
    "the @xmath8 behaviour is independent of the details of the energy dispersion relation , the transport time and the wave function overlap factors .",
    "notice , however , that the @xmath8 behaviour might be modified if one includes corrections to the drag conductivity due to higher order terms in the interlayer interaction @xcite .",
    "we now assume that the interlayer separation is large , @xmath76 .",
    "the interlayer coulomb interaction decays exponentially with @xmath1 , thus the integration kernel of is dominated by values of @xmath68 such that @xmath77 .",
    "therefore the condition @xmath76 allow us to expand the remaining integration kernel to lowest order in @xmath68 .",
    "to lowest order , the overlap factor @xmath78 is @xmath3 .",
    "therefore at low temperature and for small @xmath68 and @xmath51 , with @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 a universal result that is independent of all the details of the system .",
    "note , that although it is clear that in this limit @xmath81 should only depend on quantities defined at the fermi level ( @xmath82 , @xmath65 ) , it is not obvious at first that changing the momentum dependence of @xmath83 or @xmath84 will not change the momentum dependence of @xmath81 . for small @xmath68 we approximate @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the density of states of layer @xmath19 , and",
    "the rpa dielectric function becomes @xmath87 with @xmath88 , the thomas - fermi screening momentum in 2d of layer @xmath19 .",
    "if we assume that we have strong screening , @xmath89 , we further approximate @xcite @xmath90 if the dispersion relation of layer @xmath19 is given by a power law , @xmath91 , then we have @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , for a linear dispersion relation the condition @xmath93 is equivalent to @xmath94 ; while for a parabolic dispersion relation @xmath95 is independent of @xmath96 , and therefore @xmath93 becomes an extra assumption .",
    "assuming @xmath89 , and using and in we obtain the following expression for the drag conductivity :    @xmath97    this expression is valid for @xmath98 and is universal in the sense that is does not depend on the particular forms of the energy dispersion relations , transport time dependence on momentum or wave function structure .",
    "we obtain the familiar 2deg @xmath8 and @xmath0 behaviour for the drag conductivity , proving that it is indeed a much more general result .",
    "if the metallic layers are immersed in a homogeneous dielectric medium , with dielectric constant @xmath40 , one should multiply by @xmath99 .",
    "now , we notice that in the low temperature limit the intralayer conductivity for isotropic systems is given by the boltzmann result @xmath100 where the factor of @xmath101 comes from the fact that we are in two dimensions , the density of states at the fermi energy is given by @xmath102 and that the carrier density is related to the fermi momentum in two dimensions by @xmath103 this allow us to express the drag resistivity in terms of the carrier densities as @xmath104 it is also usual to express the drag resistivity in this limit in terms of the fermi energy , momentum and thomas - fermi screening momentum .",
    "to do this we assume a power law energy dispersion relation , @xmath105 , obtaining @xmath106 for drag between two 2deg , @xmath107 , @xmath108 ( spin degeneracy ) , we re - obtain the known formula from @xcite . for graphene",
    "we obtain exactly the same result , since @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( spin and valley degeneracy ) .",
    "finally , for the case where each of the two layers are formed by graphene bilayers , @xmath107 , @xmath110 ( spin and valley degeneracy ) , we have an extra factor of @xmath111 .",
    "now we specialize to the case where both metallic layers are formed by single layer graphene , slg , and analyze the behaviour of the drag conductivity when the layer separation is small , @xmath112 . in this situation",
    "we can no longer expand the non - linear susceptibilities for small @xmath68 and need to consider its full dependence on @xmath68 .",
    "in graphene the wave function overlap factor is @xmath113 with @xmath114 for the conduction and valence band , respectively .",
    "therefore , the non - linear susceptibility in the low temperature limit reads @xmath115 where the factor of @xmath116 comes from the spin and valley degeneracies .",
    "is in disagreement with the expressions obtained in @xcite both for the momentum independent and for the linearly momentum dependent transport time cases .",

    "we clarify that in @xcite , as in this paper , the group velocity used is constant and the transport time depends linearly in momentum , so that the vertex function depends linearly in momentum , @xmath159 .",
    "however , as we have argued in the previous section , the momentum dependence of the vertex function is irrelevant in this limit .",
    "the incorrect @xmath11 dependence was obtained in @xcite due to an error at the end of the asymptotic calculation : for small @xmath160 and @xmath141 with @xmath161 the function @xmath162 was taken to behave as @xmath163 , when it actually behaves as @xmath164 .",

    "the reason the al@xmath177o@xmath178 is not directly deposited on top of graphene is due to graphene being chemically inert . in @xcite , the dielectric constant of the ald alumina",
    "was determined by studying how the capacitance of devices similar to the ones from @xcite scales with the tickness of the ald layer keeping the alo@xmath199 layer thickness fixed , obtaining the already referred value of @xmath190 .",

    "it is therefore a more general result than previous ones .",
    "central to this fact is the general expression derived for the non - linear susceptibility , , in the low temperature limit to lowest order in frequency .",
    "being general , this result also applies to graphene , and should close the ongoing debate regarding the behaviour of drag for this system in the aforementioned limit .",
    "we also derived an asymptotic expression for drag in graphene in the limit of low temperature , high density and small layer separation .",
    "finally , we compared the available experimental data on drag in graphene from @xcite with our theoretical model and found out that if one insists in the conventional value for graphene fine structure constant , @xmath182 , a quantitative understanding of the data is still lacking .",
    "this is most likely due to the complexity of the dielectric substrate used and one hopes that the theoretical model will be quantitatively more successful in devices built using simpler substrates , such as boron nitride @xcite .",
    "another possibility to account for this discrepancy could be spacial inhomogeneities in the chemical potential of the graphene layers , which are not taken into account with the present formalism .",
    "although , it is not clear if these should be important in the experimental range investigated , spacial inhomogeneities in graphene s carrier density will for sure play an important role in the electron - hole puddle regime and should be object of future work .",
