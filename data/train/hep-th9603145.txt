    "in quantum field theoretical perturbation theory it is sometimes desirable or even indispensable to sum up infinite classes of feynman diagrams .",
    "for example , in the framework of field theory at finite temperatures characteristic properties of some propagators only reveal themselves after certain resummations of the perturbation series have been performed @xcite .",
    "another case are perturbative calculations beyond the two - loop level , where resumming subclasses of diagrams can be very helpful in taming the large number of diagrams and their combinatorics .    in the more interesting cases the classes of diagrams to be summed up are nested in some way .",
    "this can for example result from an iterative definition of these diagrams .",
    "the correct counting of diagrams is then not trivial and their resummation may be susceptible to errors .",
    "the literature contains examples for this kind of problems ; for a discussion see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is advantageous to rely on systematic methods when classes of diagrams are to be summed .    in this article",
    "we discuss the summation of tadpole ( and related ) diagrams in a quantum field theory with three - point and four - point couplings . with the help of dyson - schwinger equations all tadpole subdiagrams , to be specified below ,",
    "can be summed up .",
    "this leads to modified feynman rules such that the set of feynman diagrams , which need to be considered , reduces to those without tadpoles .",
    "in order to be definite we restrict ourselves to the case of a scalar field theory .",
    "the method , however , is essentially of combinatoric nature and can be generalized to other models straightforwardly .",
    "our motivation comes from a three - loop calculation in scalar field theory in the phase with broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "the number of diagrams we encountered is already nonnegligible : there are 204 one - particle irreducible diagrams contributing to the inverse propagator at the three - loop level , compared to 20 at two loops . after exploiting symmetries",
    "there are still 162 of them .",
    "many of them contain tadpoles and their elimination by means of dyson - schwinger equations simplifies the book - keeping very much .",
    "the reduced set of one - particle irreducible propagator - diagrams without tadpoles only contains 34 elements . at the four - loop level",
    "the gain is even larger .",
    "the term tadpole diagram ( in the context of feynman diagrams ) is used differently in the literature .",
    "an early reference is @xcite .",
    "we use the following notation .",
    "the `` bare tadpole '' is the following subdiagram    mftadpole @xmath0 which is attached with its tail to the rest of a feynman diagram .",
    "obviously it exists only in theories with three - point vertices .",
    "a `` tadpole diagram '' is a connected subdiagram which is connected with the rest of a feynman diagram only through a single line , like these examples : @xmath1 there is no momentum flow from a tadpole diagram to the rest of the diagram .",
    "normal ordering would remove the bare tadpole but not all of the tadpole diagrams .",
    "the sum of all tadpole diagrams , graphically denoted by @xmath2 is called the `` tadpole '' .",
    "apart from the tadpole diagrams there is another class of subdiagrams which do not have momentum flowing in or out .",
    "these are the `` bare snail '' ( also known as the slug ) , @xmath3 and the `` snail diagrams '' , which are connected with the rest of a feynman diagram through two lines which meet at a vertex , like these examples @xmath4 the sum of all snail diagrams , the `` snail '' , @xmath5 equals the full propagator in x - space at coinciding arguments . in the literature",
    "the snail diagrams are sometimes also called tadpole diagrams .",
    "when we speak of a summation of tadpole diagrams we also include the snail diagrams .",
    "tadpole and snail diagrams may appear anywhere as subdiagrams of feynman diagrams . since any feynman diagram can be decorated by adding tadpoles and snails at all possible places",
    ", they occur in a nested way like in this example : @xmath6 in the following we shall discuss how tadpole and snail diagrams can be summed completely .",
    "the discussion is in the context of bare perturbation theory .",
    "the method , however , can be applied to renormalized perturbation theory in the same manner .",
    "we consider the quantum field theory of a real scalar field @xmath7 in @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the action , containing three - point and four - point couplings , is @xmath9 the mass and couplings are the bare ones and are therefore labelled by an index @xmath10 .",
    "an action of this type appears in @xmath11-theory in the phase with spontaneously broken symmetry . in this case",
    "the relation @xmath12 holds , but here we shall not make use of it .    in coordinate space",
    "the feynman diagrams are built from the following elements .",
    "the bare propagator is represented as @xmath13 and the vertices are @xmath14 the connected green s functions are denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "their generating functional is written as @xmath16 = \\ln \\frac{z[j]}{z[0]}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 = \\int\\!\\!d\\phi(x ) \\",

    "equation ( [ opi-2pktgr ] ) for the inverse propagator contains the tadpole , the double - tadpole and the snail as constant terms on the right hand side .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the inverse bare propagator @xmath44 .",
    "this suggests to introduce the modified mass @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 as well as the modified propagator @xmath48 for vanishing source we have @xmath49 the sixth term on the right hand side of ( [ opi-2pktgr ] ) contains another tadpole attached to a bare vertex .",

    "now we make use of the fact that iteration of the dyson - schwinger equations produces perturbation theory in terms of feynman diagrams , as discussed above . using the modified form of the equations",
    "we conclude that it is possible to calculate @xmath56 , @xmath57 , in terms of feynman diagrams without tadpoles or snails .",
    "the procedure is summarized as follows :    * in order to calculate @xmath56 draw all one - particle irreducible feynman diagrams which do not contain tadpole or snail subdiagrams .",
    "* for the lines use the modified propagator @xmath66 with @xmath67 . *",
    "the four - point vertex is given by @xmath68 , + the three - point vertex by @xmath69 .",
    "the tadpoles have been summed up effectively by the modification of the bare parameters .",
    "what remains to be done is the calculation of @xmath70 and @xmath71 in terms of feynman diagrams without tadpoles .",
    "in order to express the vertex functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 , in terms of the original bare parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which is often necessary in applications ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , we have to substitute @xmath74 the two - point function @xmath75 can be obtained as described in the previous section .",
    "so the tadpole @xmath71 itself must finally be calculated .",
    "it is given by the sum of all connected feynman diagrams with one external point .",
    "it suggests itself to apply the summation method again and to calculate @xmath71 by excluding tadpole subdiagrams and using the modified parameters @xmath76 and @xmath50 .",
    "this procedure , however , does not yield the correct result .",
    "the combinatoric factors would come out wrong at two loops and beyond , as an explicit calculation shows .",
    "the reason is that the symmetry factors in the appropriate dyson - schwinger equation for the one - point function are not those which would correspond to a naive application of the modified feynman rules .",
    "let us consider this equation : @xmath77 @xmath78 with the abbreviations @xmath79 this is a cubic equation for @xmath71 , of the form @xmath80 with @xmath81 the relevant solution can be written down in closed form with the help of cardano s formulae @xcite but for the purpose of perturbation theory it is more convenient to write it as a power series in the couplings : @xmath82 this series is most easily obtained by solving ( [ ds - tp ] ) iteratively .",
    "now @xmath71 is known in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath83 , which on the other hand are calculable by means of the modified perturbation theory . in practice one",
    "proceeds in the following way :    * calculate @xmath55 and @xmath83 in terms of @xmath76 , @xmath73 and @xmath50 with the modified feynman rules of the previous section .",
    "* insert the definitions ( [ tilde - def ] ) into the results and expand in powers of the couplings . * using the resulting expressions evaluate @xmath84 recursively by replacing every occurrence of @xmath71 on the right hand side by the complete right hand side and every occurrence of @xmath55 by the expression obtained in the second step .    to every finite order in perturbation theory this straightforward algebraic procedure stops after a finite number of steps since every substitution is accompanied by additional factors of @xmath73 or @xmath85 .",
    "the necessary loop orders of the calculation are as follows .",
    "suppose you wish to calculate @xmath56 to @xmath86 loops . clearly the first part is to calculate all one - particle irreducible @xmath58-point diagrams without tadpoles up to @xmath86 loops .",
    "for the second part of the calculation one needs @xmath71 to @xmath87 loops , if @xmath88 or 3 . for larger @xmath58 one",
    "needs @xmath71 only to @xmath89 loops .",
    "this calculation according to the procedure above requires all @xmath90-loop diagrams for @xmath91 plus one additional loop integration ( for the coinciding arguments ) , as well as all @xmath92-loop diagrams for @xmath93 plus two additional loop integrations .",
    "with the help of dyson - schwinger equations we have discussed how tadpole and snail diagrams occurring in the perturbative calculation of green s functions and vertex functions can be summed up by means of modified feynman rules .",
    "the calculation has two parts .",
    "the first one consists of the evaluation of feynman diagrams without tadpole and snail subdiagrams .",
    "this reduces the number of diagrams significantly . in the feynman rules",
    "modified parameters are used . in the second part",
    "the modified parameters are related to the original ones .",
    "this task is essentially algebraic and amounts to the iterative solution of an equation for the tadpole .",
