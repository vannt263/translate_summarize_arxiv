    "a further observation in the case of two stationary holes is that there is a bump in @xmath125 half - way between them corresponding to the location at which incoming waves emitted from the holes converge ( see @xmath132 in fig .",

    "@xcite , and section 2.5 of ref .",
    "there , the cgle displays similar glassy - like transition patterns characterized by large plateaus of coherent regions with hole - like patterns being continuously created and destroyed .",

    "[ fig:1dpf_k14_6 ] and [ fig:1dpf_k14_8 ] in the @xmath138 case ) , and these new features interact in a nontrivial two dimensional manner .",

    "further , the phase plots show some distinct target - like patterns of nested closed surfaces of constant phase ( see @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) .",
    "as time progresses , coherent regions ( red in the @xmath125 plots ) become dominant and only small islands of incoherent regions remain ( blue in the @xmath125 plots ) . similar to our previous observation of propagating fronts when @xmath157 ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : sineb_kgkc_213 ] and [ fig : sineb_kgkc_311 ] ) , coherent regions can form in an originally incoherent region ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "for example , see the figures from @xmath162 to @xmath163 , and especially from @xmath164 to @xmath165 , where we see coherent regions ( red / yellow ) appearing and growing in the interior of incoherent ( blue ) blob , eventually destroying it .",
    "as can be inferred by comparing the @xmath125 and @xmath166 plots , small blue , dot - like features in the @xmath125 plots represent phase defects in the complex amplitude ( i.e. , counter clockwise encirclement of such a feature leads to a phase change of either @xmath167 or @xmath168 ) , and these blue dot features are commonly seen as spiral wave type patterns in the phase plots .",
    "when , as in the previously noted plots from @xmath164 to @xmath169 , coherent regions take over from an incoherent patch , we also note that a number of phase defects result ( which must be formed in opposite - spiral - parity pairs due to the conservation of topological charge ) ; see @xmath170 .",
    "the isolated phase defects subsequently wander about , and some of them are seen to annihilate with others of opposite parity ( see the two defects closest to the bottom of the picture at @xmath171 and their evolution up to @xmath172 ) , or sometimes they are absorbed into an incoherent region ( e.g. , compare the @xmath125 plots at @xmath164 and @xmath160 ) .",
    "lastly , regarding the speed of motion of spiral patterns , we note that similar to the observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : four_hole_abs ] , when oppositely charged spirals get close enough to each other , their speed of approach becomes distinctively faster till they annihilate each other .    in studies of the cgle ,",
    "the hole pattern and spiral wave pattern are analogous phenomena occurring in @xmath138 and @xmath137 , respectively . indeed ,",
    "the hole pattern and spiral wave pattern exhibit similar characteristics in our study .",
    "both features are stable with respect to small changes in parameters , and exhibit similar dynamical characteristics of approach and annihilation as described above .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : spi_core ] shows , in parallel with fig . [ fig : hol_core ] , that the central core of the spiral wave pattern occupies a finite area when @xmath136 .",
    "this is similar to the chimera - centered spirals noted in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another class of local coherent structures supported in the @xmath137 case is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pulse_abs ] and [ fig : pulse_ph ] , which shows a localized pulsating spot in an incoherent background .",
    "it is interesting to notice that oscillations of the magnitude and phase ( which show up in the form of target patterns ) of @xmath83 are not the same , with that of the phase oscillation being more irregular and more than an order of magnitude faster than the amplitude oscillation ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pulse_abs_tvariation ] and [ fig : pulse_ph_tvariation ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the cgle , stable pulsating patterns come only with the addition of a quintic term ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and the later work ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the spatio - temporal dynamics of spatially coupled oscillator systems where the oscillators have a heterogeneous distribution of response times . using the results of refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , we have derived a macroscopic pde description for this situation [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_4])-([eq : eta_4 ] ) ] .",
    "the resulting macroscopic dynamics are found to exhibit a wide variety of pattern formation behaviors .",
    "we characterized the possible behaviors roughly according to the hysteresis loop corresponding to bistable homogeneous incoherent and homogeneous coherent state solutions .",
    "numerical studies show that the system behaviors for @xmath53 sufficiently below / above the bistable @xmath53-range are simple in that the homogeneous incoherent / coherent state eventually takes over the entire domain . in contrast , for @xmath53 in or near the bistable range the system can exhibit a variety of interesting spatio - temporal phenomena .",
    "these include propagating fronts , bridge patterns , hole patterns ( @xmath138 ) , spiral waves ( @xmath137 ) , spots , target patterns , pulsating patterns , etc .",
    "finally , it is interesting to consider the role of time delay in contributing to the features that we observed . if there is no time delay ( i.e. , @xmath173 ) , there is no homogeneous bistable behavior as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : hys_ome05 ] , and the transition from the homogeneous incoherent state to the homogeneous coherent state is supercritical and takes place at @xmath174 . in this case",
    ", many of the interesting spatio - temporal phenomena that we have found for @xmath175 are absent .",
    "for example , when @xmath176 , the intricate 1d glassy state transitions were not observed , and the system typically evolves relatively rapidly into either homogeneous incoherent or homogeneous coherent state solutions .",
    "the 2d waves arisen from topological defects are still present ; however , for @xmath176 the system will be similar to the case of zero nonlinear dispersion in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the incoherent core remains a point defect but not a finite area as observed when @xmath136 .",
    "thus finite response time introduces additional dynamics , leading to the large variety of behaviors observed ."
