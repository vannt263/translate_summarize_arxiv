    "the concept of _ normal modes _ plays a central role for the theory of oscillations of linear system . in a normal mode",
    "the dynamics of a finite linear system is equivalent to those of a system with one degree of freedom .",
    "linear normal modes ( lnms ) can be used to decouple a linear system of @xmath0 degrees of freedom of coupled oscillators such that it performs oscillatory motions resulting from the superposition of its eigensolutions with associated eigenfrequencies .",
    "the repercussions are : ( i ) that if a specific eigenmode only is stimulated then the motion is restrained to the corresponding harmonic oscillations and energy transfer into other modes is impossible ( invariance ) .",
    "( ii ) any form of free or harmonically forced oscillatory motion can be expressed as the superposition of the @xmath0 modes of natural frequencies .",
    "these modes result in stationary periodic solutions for which all units pass through their extreme values of the coordinates and velocities simultaneously ( modal superposition ) .",
    "however , the assumption of linearity seems too idealised as it is justifiable typically for sufficiently small amplitudes only .",
    "thus in general one deals inevitably with nonlinear restoring forces for which the linear methods such as the superposition principle is not applicable .    to gain insight into the response of a nonlinear system to excitations",
    "elaborate methods based on perturbational approaches to derive ( approximate ) solutions have been developed which rely on weak nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for large amplitude dynamics related to strong nonlinearity the expression of exact solutions of the underlying system of ordinary differential equations in closed analytical form ( if existent at all ) is in most cases impossible . regarding exact solutions of finite nonlinear systems",
    "the concept of nonlinear normal modes ( nnms ) was developed to understand dynamical features of systems featuring strong nonlinearity . like",
    "their linear counterparts nnms are understood as a _ vibration in unison _ of the system , i.e. all units of the system perform synchronous oscillations @xcite . compared to their linear counterpart for nnms the superposition principle does not apply and the lack of orthogonality relations restricts their usage as bases for the expression of solutions of the underlying nonlinear system in terms of weighted sums of eigenfunctions . a generalised definition of nnms by geometric means utilising the center manifold technique was given by shaw and pierre @xcite .",
    "the existence of nnms of hamiltonian systems obeying certain symmetries has been addressed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the role of nnms with regard to the qualitative and quantitative investigation of nonlinear features has been illuminated in numerous studies ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite and for a recent review we refer to @xcite and references therein ) . to underline the significance of nnms for the interpretation of nonlinear phenomena , the driven resonant motion of nonlinear systems evolves close to nnms and localisation and energy transfer can be explained in terms of nnms @xcite .",
    "recently the concept of nnms has been facilitated as a theoretical tool to accomplish targeted energy transfer @xcite-@xcite .",
    "studies of nnms in non - smooth systems have been performed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to prove the existence of nnms for a general system of two coupled oscillators represented by spatially localised and time - periodic solutions .",
    "we treat two types of on - site potentials ; namely hard and soft ones . unlike for the continuation process of ( trivially ) localised solutions starting from the anti - continuum limit @xcite-@xcite",
    "our approach is not necessarily confined to the weak coupling regime .",
    "in this work we prove the existence of spatially localised time - periodic solutions , i.e. nnms , for generic nonlinear interacting oscillators given by the following system @xmath1 the variable @xmath2 is the amplitude of the oscillator at site @xmath0 evolving in an anharmonic on - site potential @xmath3 .",
    "we introduced the notation @xmath4 .",
    "the prime @xmath5 stands for the derivative with respect to the argument and an overdot @xmath6 represents the derivative with respect to time @xmath7 .",
    "the two oscillators interact with each other via an attractive force derived from an interaction potential @xmath8 which is analytic and furthermore , is assumed to have the following features : @xmath9 thus @xmath8 is convex which is further characterised by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction potential can be harmonic ( diffusive interaction ) but also anharmonic such as e.g. interactions of @xmath12fermi - pasta - ulam - type and toda - type .",
    "the strength of the coupling is determined by the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the on - site potential @xmath14 is analytic and is assumed to have the following properties : @xmath15 in what follows we differentiate between soft on - site potentials and hard on - site potentials . for the former ( latter ) the oscillation frequency of an oscillator moving in the on - site potential @xmath16 decreases ( increases ) with increasing oscillation amplitude .",
    "a soft potential possesses at least one inflection point .",
    "if a soft potential possesses a single inflection point , denoted by @xmath17 , we suppose without loss of generality ( w.l.o.g . ) that @xmath18",
    ". then the following relations are valid @xmath19 if @xmath16 possesses two inflection points denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 it holds that @xmath22 we remark that @xmath16 can have more than two inflection points ( an example is a periodic potential @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , in the frame of the current study we are only interested in motion between the inflection points adjacent to the minimum of @xmath16 at @xmath24 .",
    "hence , in the forthcoming we make the * assumption * that for soft on - site potentials the motion at each lattice site @xmath25 stays inbetween the inflection points , viz .",
    "@xmath26 , where @xmath16 is convex .",
    "hard on - site potentials are , in addition to the assumptions in ( [ eq : assumptions ] ) , characterised in their entire range of definition by @xmath27 for hard on - site potentials we make the * assumption * that the motion takes place in the range @xmath28 $ ] , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the system ( [ eq : start1]),([eq : start2 ] ) possesses an energy integral @xmath32+\\kappa v(q_1-q_2).\\ ] ] there exists a closed maximum equipotential surface @xmath33 bounding all motions and one has @xmath34 on this surface .",
    "in the following we prove the existence of nnms for the system([eq : start1]),([eq : start2 ] ) with soft on - site potentials .",
    "in more detail , we show that there exists a one - parameter family of spatially localised and time - periodic solutions where the amplitude acts as the parameter .",
    "localisation means that either @xmath35 or @xmath36 for all @xmath37 , and equality holds only at moments of time when the amplitudes of two oscillators pass simultaneously through zero . the goal is to prove that such localised periodic solutions exist under general conditions on @xmath14 and @xmath38 .",
    "we emphasise that the existence of localised solutions has to be distinguished from the fact that simply due to exchange symmetry , @xmath39 , of the underlying system an in - phase mode with equal amplitudes @xmath40 always exists .",
    "furthermore , if , in addition , the potential @xmath16 possesses the spatial reflexion symmetry @xmath41 , an out - of - phase mode characterised by @xmath42 is supported .",
    "* theorem 1 : * let @xmath43 be the smooth solutions to eqs.([eq : start1]),([eq : start2 ] ) with a soft on - site potential satisfying the assumptions above . then there exist periodic solutions @xmath44 for @xmath25 , so that the oscillators perform either in - phase motion , i.e. @xmath45 , or out - of - phase motion , i.e. @xmath46 , with period @xmath47 and frequency @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",

    "the time evolution of the difference variables @xmath63 is determined by the following equation @xmath64 - 2\\kappa \\frac{\\partial v(q_1-q_2)}{\\partial q_1 }    \\label{eq : deltap},\\ ] ] where we used that @xmath65 .",
    "discarding the negative term @xmath66 and utilising that for @xmath67 @xmath68 with @xmath69 @xcite enables us to bound the r.h.s .",

    "the time evolution of the difference variable is determined by an equation identical to ( [ eq : deltap ] ) and using @xmath198 @xcite and @xmath199 for @xmath72 , we derive for @xmath200 for the r.h.s . an upper bound and lower bound for the r.h.s .",

    "we have proven the existence of exact time - periodic spatially localised solutions , i.e. localised nnms , for two coupled general nonlinear oscillators utilising the comparison principle for odes . in more detail , in systems with an anharmonic on - site potential @xmath14 the existence of in - phase and out - of - phase localised periodic solutions has been proven . furthermore , suppose the interaction potential @xmath214 possesses the property @xmath215 so that for small arguments the harmonic limit of @xmath214 is valid .",
    "then , when the amplitude of the nnms tends to zero the linear nms of two linearly coupled harmonic oscillators are recovered , viz . a mode of in - phase oscillations ( @xmath40 ) and and a mode of out - of - phase oscillations ( @xmath42 ) of the two oscillators with frequency @xmath216 and @xmath217 respectively .",
    "the localised nnms as discussed above and , in general , equal - amplitude nnms and lnms , have in common that they are characterised by a vibration in unison of the system ( their involved units pass through their extreme values of the coordinates and velocities simultaneously ) .",
    "in this context , the localised solutions to the system of two coupled oscillators resemble also the localisation behaviour exhibited by breather solutions in extended lattice systems where only a few oscillators oscillate with considerable amplitude while the others oscillate with much smaller amplitudes .",
    "our developed method is expected to stimulate further research regarding the existence of time - periodic space - localised patterns and their formation in extended networks of generic coupled nonlinear oscillators . in particular , the method developed in this paper can be utilised to prove the existence of nnms in finite size lattices with global coupling .",
