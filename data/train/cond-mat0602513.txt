    "the study of complex systems has been lately one the most active areas of investigation .",
    "this multidisciplinary subject has interest in natural sciences as well as in social and artificial systems . in physics ,",
    "a major area involved is statistical mechanics .",
    "it is precisely for such systems that nonextensive statistical mechanics ( nsm )  @xcite appears to have its applicability .",
    "typical features present in complex systems are long - range interactions , long - term memory , fractal phase - space structure , scale - free network structure , or even combinations of these characteristics .",
    "quite frequently these systems can not be correctly described by the well - established boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics ( bgsm ) .",
    "indeed , they often fail to verify its basic assumptions ( equiprobability of phase - space occupation  @xcite and ergodicity  @xcite at the thermal equilibrium state ) .",
    "nsm generalises the usual bgsm formalism through the definition of the q - entropy @xmath18^q}{q-1}$ ] ( with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 stands for _ boltzmann - gibbs _ ) under simple constraints  @xcite .",
    "this theory has been extensively applied to nonlinear dynamical systems  @xcite , as they are one of the most widespread and useful ways for modelling complex phenomena .",
    "for example , hamiltonian systems are at the core of physics and consequently their relevance is evident",
    ". there has been an important number of results indicating that certain conservative models ( e.g. , the @xmath17-xy model  @xcite , the @xmath17-heisenberg model  @xcite , the @xmath17-lennard - jones - like gas  @xcite ) can present a behaviour departing from the one predicted by the bg formalism . for certain classes of initial conditions and parameters , the system is prevented from virtually attaining its expected equilibrium state in finite time when @xmath21 . in other words , if the @xmath9 limit is taken before the @xmath22 limit , the system becomes nonergodic .",
    "this nonergodicity is also reflected in a variety of anomalous behaviours such as non - gaussian momenta probability density functions , negative specific heat , aging , and others  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , other ( simpler ) nonlinear dynamical systems , as for example maps , have emerged in many contexts , very often exhibiting new and interesting results . among these systems",
    "we find the logistic map , the standard map , coupled map lattices , discretised lorentz gas , and many others  @xcite .",
    "both low- and high - dimensional discrete - time dynamical systems have been studied under the framework of nsm , exhibiting various connections with hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is known quite well that the number of degrees of freedom of a system defines the possibilities that its dynamics may approach . a clear illustration of this fact in low - dimensional systems ( e.g. , the 2-dimensional chirikov - taylor standard map ) is the kam tori , a complex structure in the map phase - space that separates chaotic from regular regions .",
    "while much is known for systems with few degrees of freedom , the situation is more intricate when many elements are involved .",
    "this is because the @xmath23 phase - space grows in an extremely rapid manner .",
    "in addition to this , studying continuous - time many - body systems can turn out to be very difficult , if not impossible at all , due to the considerable computational time needed to integrate the evolution equations .",
    "this is even more so when long - range forces are involved , as it is not justified to neglect any interaction between the elements .",
    "an alternative for this problem is the substitution of the continuous - time system for simpler discrete - time systems , such as maps , which conserve many of the important features of the physics involved .",
    "this substitution is in fact justified interpreting a dimensional map system as the intersection ( in the gibbs @xmath23 phase - space ) of a poincar plane with the orbit of a higher dimensional hamiltonian .",
    "more precisely , if we consider a _ time - independent _ hamiltonian system with ( @xmath24 ) degrees of freedom ( ( @xmath25)-dimensional @xmath23 phase - space ) , a ( @xmath26)-dimensional symplectic map is the result of taking a poincar section over the constant energy hypersurface  @xcite .",
    "the recurrence time is discrete and the map is useful in displaying various properties of the original hamiltonian system .",
    "nsm concepts have been shown to have an important role in low - dimensional maps at the edge of chaos .",
    "the archetypical logistic map ( a @xmath27 , dissipative , nonlinear map ) is one of the most widely studied dissipative systems . in part due to its simplicity",
    ", it is often used to illustrate many of the most important features of chaos . in recent works ,",
    "robledo and baldovin  @xcite have analytically proved , using standard renormalisation - group techniques , that the dynamics of the logistic map at its critical point is unmistakenly well - described within a nsm frame .",
    "the sensitivity to initial conditions is a @xmath28-exponential function  @xcite , and is related to the entropy production through the @xmath28-generalised pesin - like identity , linking the sensitivity to initial conditions to the @xmath28-entropy @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the logistic - map with noise ( a langevin - like generalisation of the usual logistic map ) has been found to present two - step relaxation processes and aging ( presenting interesting common points with slow glassy dynamics  @xcite ) .",
    "other aspects of the nsm formalism were also studied in the more general case of one - dimensional @xmath31-logistic family of maps considering the attractor fractal nature  @xcite . regarding two - dimensional ( @xmath32 ) _ dissipative _ systems ( as the henn map or its linearised version , the lozi map ) , results indicate that it presents the same value of @xmath28 as the logistic map , therefore suggesting a common universality class  @xcite . regarding two - dimensional ( @xmath32 ) _ conservative _ maps , a very interesting example , the triangle casati - prosen map ( mixing , ergodic , but with vanishing lyapunov exponent ) , has been recently been studied in connection to the entropy @xmath29 with @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "moving further into conservative discrete - time systems , two - step relaxation has been also observed at the edge of chaos for the chirikov - taylor standard map , a paradigmatic one for @xmath34-dimensional symplectic maps . this map has been thoroughly studied and explained by means of the kam - theorem  @xcite .",
    "this map is known to be area preserving , hence its variables are often considered as `` coordinate '' and `` momentum '' , in analogy with hamiltonian systems . along this",
    "lines , it is appealing to look to the more general case of a _",
    "symplectic _ system of @xmath0 coupled standard maps ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "different efforts were done for values of @xmath0 as low as @xmath36 up to @xmath37  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the same two - step relaxation was found as well as other features pointing to a nsm applicability .",
    "but in all these cases , the coupling was done trough the _ momentum _ variables .",
    "even though this has its own interest , it would be instructive to see the effects of coupling such a system through the _ coordinate _ variables , as in more realistic situations .    in this work we will study a high - dimensional globally coupled conservative map system that , as discussed above , presents many of the characteristics of hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "our purpose is to contribute to the understanding of the role that nsm plays in the anomalous features present in long - range - interacting dynamical systems .",
    "our results show interesting similarities between this map model and many - body long - range - interacting hamiltonian dynamics , in particular the @xmath17-xy model . in both cases , long - lasting metastable states , as well as weak chaos ,",
    "are present in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "both features point out that under certain initial conditions , orbits do _ not _ visit with equal probability the entire @xmath23 phase space , or in other words there is a failure in ergodicity .    in the next section",
    "we introduce and describe the model , as well as some relevant details of our simulations . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "we report on the scaling behaviour of the largest lyapunov exponent with the system size @xmath0 , and point out connections with hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "we analyse the relaxation to equilibrium , and we make a systematic characterisation as a function of the system parameters . finally , a discussion and summary are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "our model is a set of @xmath0 symplectically coupled ( hence conservative ) standard maps , where the coupling is made through the _ coordinates _ as follows :    @xmath38 + \\\\               &    & \\mbox{}\\\\               &    & \\frac{b}{2\\pi\\tilde n}\\sum\\limits_{\\substack { \\begin{subarray}{1 } j=1\\\\j\\neq i \\end{subarray } } } ^n\\frac{sin[2\\pi(\\theta_i(t)-\\theta_j(t))]}{r^\\alpha_{ij } } & \\;({\\rm mod}\\;1 ) ,    \\end{array } \\label{eq_azp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the discrete time @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 parameter is the usual nonlinear constant of the individual standard map , whereas the @xmath43 parameter modulates the overall strength of the long - range coupling .",
    "both parameters contribute to the nonlinearity of the system ; it becomes integrable when @xmath44 . for simplicity ,",
    "we have studied only the cases @xmath45 , @xmath46 , but we expect similar results when one or both of these parameters are negative . the systematic study of the whole parameter space is certainly welcome .",
    "notice that , in order to describe a system whose phase space is bounded , we are considering , as usual , only the torus ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "additionally , the maps are localised in a one dimensional ( @xmath1 ) regular lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the distance @xmath48 is the minimum distance between maps @xmath49 and @xmath50 , hence it can take values from unity to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) for even ( odd ) number @xmath0 of maps . note that @xmath48 is a fixed quantity that , modulated with the power @xmath17 , enters eq .",
    "( [ eq_azp ] ) as an effective time - independent coupling constant . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath17 regulates the range of the interaction between maps .",
    "the sum is global ( i.e. , it includes every pair of maps ) , so the limiting cases @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspond respectively to infinitely long range and nearest neighbours . in our case @xmath55=1 , thus @xmath56 ( @xmath5 ) means _ long - range _ ( _ short - range _ ) coupling .",
    "moreover , the coupling term is normalised by the sum  @xcite , to yield a non - diverging quantity as the system size grows ( for simplicity , we have replaced here the exact discrete sum over integer @xmath3 by its continuous approximation ) .",
    "if @xmath57 denotes a map system , then @xmath58 is symplectic when its jacobian @xmath59 satisfies the relation  @xcite : @xmath60 where the superindex @xmath61 indicates the transposed matrix , and @xmath62 is the poisson matrix , defined by @xmath63 @xmath64 being the @xmath65 identity matrix . a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ e.simplectic ] ) is that the jacobian determinant @xmath66 indicating that the map @xmath58 is _ ( hyper)volume - preserving_. in particular , for our model @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath26-dimensional vector @xmath69 , and @xmath70 with @xmath71+\\frac{b}{\\tilde n}\\sum _ { j\\neq i}\\frac{cos[2\\pi(\\theta_i(t)-\\theta_j(t))]}{r^\\alpha_{ij } } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath72}{r^\\alpha_{ij } } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath73 . it can be seen that",
    ", @xmath74 hence @xmath75 this quantity , multiplied ( from the right side ) by the matrix ( [ matrix1 ] ) yields @xmath62 . therefore our system is symplectic .",
    "consequently , the @xmath26 lyapunov exponents @xmath76 are coupled two by two as follows:@xmath77 .",
    "in other words , as a function of time , an infinitely small _ length _ typically diverges as @xmath78 , an infinitely small _ area _ diverges as @xmath79 , an infinitely small _ volume _ diverges as @xmath80 , an infinitely small @xmath0-dimensional _ hypervolume _ diverges as @xmath81 ( @xmath82 being in fact equal to the kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate , in agreement with the pesin identity ) , an infinitely small @xmath83-hypervolume diverges as @xmath84 , and so on .",
    "for example , a @xmath85-hypervolume diverges as @xmath78 , and finally a @xmath26-hypervolume remains constant , thus recovering the conservative nature of the system ( of course , this corresponds to the liouville theorem in classical hamiltonian dynamics ) .    for @xmath53 ,",
    "similar models exist in the literature though in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "the present particular choice for the coupling was made with the purpose of comparison with many - body hamiltonian systems .",
    "indeed , one can derive the map set of equations ( 1 ) by applying a discretisation procedure to the @xmath17-xy model with an external field ( for more details see  @xcite ) . as a consequence of having @xmath86 terms in the coupling summation and the fact that there are @xmath0 maps , the simulation times are of order @xmath87 .",
    "for this reason it is a difficult task to numerically simulate ( [ eq_azp ] ) for large values of @xmath0 . to overcome this problem , we used an algorithm that takes advantage of the symmetry of the lattice  @xcite and shortens the simulation time to @xmath88 .",
    "initial coordinates and momenta were randomly taken from the following uniform distributions : @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "for the coordinates we used @xmath91 ( i.e. , @xmath92 $ ] , _ homogeneous _ coordinate initial conditions ) .",
    "for the momenta , we concentrated in two cases . to study the sensibility to initial conditions we used a uniform distribution over the whole phase - space ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) . in the analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium we used a thin _ waterbag _ intial condition with @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    ". we also checked _ inhomogeneous _",
    "initial conditions , in particular @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( not shown in this paper ) .",
    "note that in this case there is no traslational symmetry in the coordinates .",
    "for sufficiently long times , our simulations yield the same sensitivity to initial conditions that we obtain for the symmetric case @xmath99 $ ] . on the other hand",
    ", this inhomogeneous initial condition in the coordinates has an important influence in the shape of the relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "this will be further commented in the next section .",
    "we note that the systematic study of the role of initial conditions is very instructive , but it is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "in order to analyse the sensibility to initial conditions , we numerically studied the largest lyapunov exponent ( lle ) for different values of parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath17 and @xmath0 .",
    "we used the well - known method developed by benettin et al  @xcite . as a consequence of the symplectic structure of ( [ eq_azp ] ) ,",
    "the lyapunov spectrum in the @xmath26-dimensional phase space of the map is , as already discussed , characterised by @xmath0 pairs of lyapunov coefficients , where each element of the pair is the negative of the other .",
    "therefore , the lle sets an upper bound for the absolute value of the entire spectrum of exponents .",
    "we concentrated on the evolution of the lle for different values of @xmath0 starting with @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in a typical ( sufficiently long ) realisation ,",
    "the finite - time lle , @xmath6 , is a good estimator for the analytical definition of the lle ( both quantities will coincide when @xmath103  @xcite ) .",
    "we averaged between realisations ( typically 100 ) in order to have small statistical fluctuations .",
    "we checked that , for appropriately long times , @xmath6 does not depend on the initial conditions @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath6 for typical values of the interaction - range parameter @xmath17 , and fixed values of parameters @xmath104 .",
    "our results show that the value of @xmath6 vanishes with increasing value of @xmath0 ( consequently , so does the rest of the lyapunov spectrum ) as a power - law @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and is a positive constant for @xmath5 ( @xmath107 ) . in the inset",
    "we detail @xmath108 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "this shows that the map system is _ weakly chaotic _ for long - range coupling ( @xmath109 when @xmath110 ) , whereas for short - range interactions , @xmath6 remains positive for all @xmath0 , meaning _ strongly chaotic _ dynamics ( as expected  @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , this result is totally similar to the one numerically measured and analytically predicted for the @xmath17-xy model  @xcite , thus suggesting equivalent behaviours . indeed , and as stated by anteneodo and vallejos , this scaling is typical of systems with couplings of the form @xmath111  @xcite .",
    "preliminary simulations suggest that the fact that the weak chaos region extends slightly over @xmath112 is an expected consequence of finite - size and finite - time effects .",
    "the dependence of @xmath6 with the nonlinear parameter @xmath42 for different ranges of the interaction @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "we can see that , for @xmath113 , @xmath6 decreases with @xmath42 and saturates for @xmath114 .",
    "this illustrates the influence of this nonlinear term . for increasing @xmath42 , the sensibility to initial conditions raises . on the other hand",
    "@xmath42 has almost no effect when @xmath5 , where the @xmath6 is approximately constant on the whole @xmath42-range .",
    "we verified that for @xmath115 a slight increase appears for @xmath5 ( as in the long - range case ) , but this effect is negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we exhibit the dependence on the coupling parameter @xmath43 , also varying @xmath17 . for high values of @xmath43 ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath117 , being @xmath118 a nonlinear function .",
    "preliminary simulations show that this exponent varies only slightly with @xmath42 and @xmath0 , suggesting that it may be unique . in the case @xmath119",
    ", we verified that @xmath120 .",
    "for @xmath5 this scaling is valid even for @xmath121 . on the other hand , if @xmath113 , a deviation from this power - law behaviour emerges when @xmath121 .",
    "our characterisation illustrates the fact that , quite generically , the sensibility to initial conditions is strongly governed by the range of the interactions .",
    "orbits are clearly chaotic in the short - range case ( as expected ) and strong numerical evidence of vanishing lle emerges when interactions are long - range , revealing a weakly chaotic regime .    our present results for the maximal lyapunov exponent can be approximatively summarised as follows :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 ; @xmath124 ; @xmath125 , @xmath41 , and @xmath126 is some function of @xmath127 ( e.g. , @xmath128 for @xmath5 ) .",
    "as stated above , system ( [ eq_azp ] ) is symplectic , hence ( hyper)volume preserving , like hamiltonian systems .",
    "a consequence of this is that @xmath129 may be interpreted as a `` coordinate '' variable and @xmath130 as the conjugate `` momentum '' .",
    "we may define a concept analogous to a _ temperature _ as twice the mean  kinetic energy \" per particle  @xcite ,    @xmath131    where @xmath132 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "this quantity can be interpreted as a dynamical analog , and plays a role similar to the physical temperature .",
    "we refer to as the _ bg - temperature _ , @xmath133 , the temperature associated with an _ uniform _ ensemble distribution in phase space .",
    "this quantity may be analytically calculated ,    @xmath134,\\ ] ]    which yields @xmath135 .",
    "we studied the evolution of the dynamical temperature @xmath61 for typical values of the parameters as described above , focusing on the relaxation towards @xmath133 .",
    "we used _ waterbag _",
    "initial conditions with _ homogeneous _ coordinate distribution @xmath99 $ ] , and momenta centered at @xmath95 with width @xmath96 .",
    "the manner in which the relaxation takes place depends strongly on the initial conditions .",
    "for example , using @xmath136 makes the system to temporarily reach a temperature greater than @xmath133 , as a consequence of the periodic boundary conditions ( torus ( @xmath137 ) ) . in general different initial conditions",
    "produce different relaxation shapes , but scaling with @xmath0 remains similar",
    ". we also checked _ inhomogeneous _",
    "coordinate distributions as initial conditions ( @xmath138 ) , and obtained results qualitatively similar to those corresponding to the homogeneous case we present here . although the temperature value in the metastable state is not as low as in the homogeneous case , long - lasting metastable plateaux appear ( very much as in the @xmath53 case of the @xmath17-xy model , also known as hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) for initial magnetisation @xmath139",
    "the duration of these plateaux also scales with @xmath0 in a qualitatively similar manner as for the homogeneous case .",
    "the particular choice of initial conditions used in this work yields a rather smooth relaxation with , for example , only one inflexion point , thus simplifying our analysis .",
    "the whole scenario is consistent with the conjecture advanced in  @xcite .",
    "this type of relaxation has already been reported for the particular case @xmath53",
    "a two - step process appears : firstly a stage where @xmath140 , and then a final relaxation to the predicted temperature @xmath133 .",
    "the initial regime varies very slowly in time yielding quasistationary ( qs ) states .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the temperature evolution for @xmath141 and @xmath142 for sizes @xmath143 .",
    "the curves crossed by the arrow correspond to the @xmath141 case , being the first one ( from left to right ) @xmath144 .",
    "all four curves for @xmath142 relax approximately at the same time , so it has the appearance of a single curve . for @xmath141 the typical two - step relaxation is obtained . from now on , we define the crossover time @xmath11 from the qs state to the bg equilibrium state by means of the inflexion point , i.e. the time that corresponds to a maximum in the time derivative of @xmath61 . the dependence of @xmath11 with @xmath0 for this choice of parameters and initial conditions is reported in the bottom left panel .",
    "the crossover time scales as @xmath145 . for @xmath146 and",
    "then @xmath11 remains constant ( as depicted for @xmath142 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath147 , i.e. , @xmath11 diverges in the thermodynamic limit @xmath110 .",
    "this result indicates the inequivalence , for long - range interactions , of the orderings @xmath22 and then @xmath9 , and @xmath9 and then @xmath22 .",
    "consistently , these qs states become permanent ( and therefore definitively relevant ) when @xmath9 . once again , the situation that is found coincides with that of the @xmath17-xy model  @xcite .    .",
    "fixed constants are @xmath144 and @xmath148 .",
    "initial conditions correspond to @xmath100 , @xmath149 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we averaged over 100 realisations . ]    finally , we studied the dependence of @xmath11 with the nonlinear parameter @xmath42 , for different values of @xmath17 , fixed coupling parameter @xmath148 , and size @xmath144 . in this case , as well as in the other situations analised in this work ,",
    "different behaviours are reported for short- and long- range interactions . for @xmath5 , the value of @xmath11 , in the limit @xmath150 , tends to a finite value .",
    "the situation is different in the long - range case , where , for @xmath151 , the crossover time @xmath11 scales as @xmath152 being @xmath153 a nonlinear function .",
    "preliminary calculations show that the deviation for the case @xmath154 and @xmath114 is due to finite - size effects .",
    "this scaling law implies that , for long - range interactions and vanishing nonlinear parameter @xmath42 , the system stays in the metastable regime permanently .",
    "our present results for the crossover time @xmath11 can be approximatively summarised as follows :    @xmath155    where @xmath156 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is some function of @xmath127 .",
    "in this work we have analysed a system of @xmath0 symplectically and globally coupled standard maps , for both short- and long - range interactions .",
    "our results connect with studies made in long - range hamiltonian systems as well as with other map systems with vanishing largest lyapunov exponent .",
    "we studied a suitably defined dynamical temperature for a region of the parameter space , and report the appearance of long - lasting quasistationary states , followed by a relaxation to the predicted equilibrium value .",
    "the relaxation time scales as @xmath159 , with @xmath160 when @xmath161 , and @xmath162 when @xmath163 , thus diverging as @xmath110 .",
    "this is a feature also present in the @xmath17-xy hamiltonian model , and constitutes a major conjecture in nonextensive statistical mechanics ( nsm ) . regarding the sensitivity to initial conditions , we calculated the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath6 as a function of the different system parameters , namely , the size of the system @xmath0 , the nonlinear parameter @xmath42 and the coupling constant @xmath43 .",
    "we found that , as the number @xmath0 of maps grows , @xmath6 vanishes as @xmath164 with @xmath165 for @xmath163 , and @xmath166 for @xmath161 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath108 with @xmath17 is reported and compared to be the same as in the @xmath17-xy model .",
    "we note that , even though the initial evolution of @xmath6 depends strongly in the initial conditions ( as the temperature does ) , this scaling does not .",
    "in fact , it coincides with that calculated with uniform initial conditions ( i.e. , initial @xmath167 uniformly distributed in the @xmath168 $ ] interval ) for @xmath169 .",
    "our results exhibit that , in the presence of long - range interactions , the system tends to be _ weakly chaotic _ in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is another feature also present in the nonextensive theory that suggests its applicability .",
    "the lack of ergodicity exhibited in our model is thought to be related to a ( multi)fractal constraint in the available phase - space that is enhanced in certain limits such as @xmath110",
    ". this possibility would be connected to extremely low arnold diffusion caused by the remanent of kam tori and islands , as has been suggested for similar high - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "the similarities of the present coupled map model and the @xmath17-xy hamiltonian model suggest that both share features that may have a common dynamical behaviour .",
