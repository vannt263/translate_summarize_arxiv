    "while the solar analogy is almost universally accepted as the starting point for the modeling of stellar coronae , its scaling to the much higher activity levels seen in active stars is still a debated question .",
    "the sun displays , even at the maximum of its 11  year cycle , a rather low level of activity , when compared to the most active stars ; dme dwarfs ( flare stars ) on the other hand exhibit quiescent activity levels which are up to three orders of magnitude higher ( n terms of the surface flux ) than the sun at minimum , and still a factor of hundred higher when compared with the sun at maximum .",
    "if the solar corona is considered in an integrated fashion ( as one has to do for unresolved stellar sources ) different areas of the sun will dominate the spectrum depending on the band of interest .",
    "@xcite have for example examined the sun in an intermediate activity state , showing that active regions ( defined as regions whose x - ray surface luminosity in the yohkoh / sxt thin aluminum filter is at least 1% of the peak surface luminosity of the sun at the given time ) occupy only 23% of the solar surface , with the rest of the solar surface covered with low surface - brightness structures ( quiet regions ) .",
    "given that the active regions have significantly higher temperatures than the quiet regions , they dominate the spectrum at different energies : notwithstanding their very low surface brightness , quiet regions still dominate the integrated spectrum below @xmath10  kev , while the few ( seven in the case examined by @xcite ) active regions dominate the spectrum at energy @xmath11  kev , where the quiet regions are essentially invisible ( @xcite ) .",
    "the active regions dominating the emission above @xmath12  kev have characteristic sizes ( loop semi - lengths ) @xmath13 ( e.g.   @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "several options are in principle available for scaling the solar corona up to the much higher x - ray luminosity seen in very active stars .",
    "one possibility is to augment the surface filling factor of the active region structures , up to complete coverage of the solar surface , without significantly changing their characteristics ( size and pressure ) .",
    "this would lead to a maximum possible increase in the x - ray luminosity of a factor of approximately 100 , thus naturally explaining the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath14  erg  s@xmath15 ) of intermediate - activity solar - type stars ( as discussed in detail by @xcite ) . to explain the higher x - ray luminosity ( up to few times @xmath16  erg  s@xmath15 )",
    "observed in the most active solar - type stars different mechanisms must be at work .",
    "the coronal structures must either be significantly larger than in the solar case , and/or the plasma pressure must increase .",
    "large coronal structures ( @xmath1 ) are implied by the results of several studies of the decay phase of stellar flares .",
    "if the active regions of x - ray luminous stars are so large , the increase in available volume , together with a high volume filling factor , could indeed lead to the higher x - ray luminosities observed in the most active stars without significantly increasing the plasma pressure  and the observed saturation could be explained in terms of a maximum coronal filling factor . at the same time , however , increasing the coronal pressure @xmath17 is  given that the x - ray emissivity of the plasma at typical coronal temperatures scales as @xmath18  a highly effective way to increase the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the question of the scaling of the corona to higher x - ray luminosity is relevant to stellar evolution in general : higher - pressure structures imply larger confining magnetic fields , which in turn will have an influence on the convection region ( magnetic fields modify the heat - transport capacity of the convective envelope ) , and thus on the structure of the star as such .",
    "high internal magnetic fields may even prevent a low - mass star from becoming fully convective .",
    "the structure of the magnetic field will also have an influence on the loss of angular momentum through magnetic braking , and thus again on the evolution of the internal structure of the star , as well as , likely , on the depletion pattern of light elements ( @xcite ) . finally , the issue of whether the frequent and intense flares seen in very active stars are produced within closed coronal structures ( as opposed to the production of intense flares in freely expanding plasmoids , i.e.  large - scale coronal mass ejections ) is relevant to the question of the contribution of the plentiful low - mass flare stars to the chemical evolution of our galaxy .",
    "lacking spatial resolution , no direct information about the size of coronal structures can be obtained for stars ( although this is sometimes possible for eclipsing binaries , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the upcoming generation of high spectral resolution x - ray missions ( _ chandra _ and xmm ) will offer the possibility of direct measurements of density - sensitive spectral diagnostics at different coronal temperatures , and thus of estimating ( using the differential emission measure determination from the line fluxes ) the volume of the emitting region as a function of temperature . even with these future large - area x - ray observatories ,",
    "however , only a limited number of bright sources will yield enough photons to produce sufficiently high @xmath19 spectra .",
    "for the most part , thus , information about the structuring of the corona on the majority of active stars will still have to rely , for the foreseeable future , on indirect methods .",
    "the study of the decay phase of stellar flares is up to now the main available tool for the determination of the characteristic sizes of coronal structures , although in principle it only gives information about the flaring regions .",
    "while many flares have been studied in these terms , most studies have been limited to the analysis of individual flaring events , whose size may well be peculiar and not representative of the typical scales of the corona as a whole , and in particular of its quiescent structures .",
    "for the few stars for which a significant number of flares has been observed , a systematic , homogeneous study can provide a more general view of the the characteristic sizes of coronal structures ; based on the solar analogy , where the same active regions which dominate the high - temperature emission measure are responsible for the flares , the flaring loops can then be used , qua size , as proxies for the active corona as a whole .    in the present paper",
    "we undertake such systematic study on the flare star ad  leo ( a dm3e star whose characteristics are discussed in detail in [ app : targ ] ) , which is an ideal target given its high x - ray flux and the significant number of flares observed thus far .",
    "the flares we analyze here have been observed by three different instruments ( _ einstein _ ipc , rosat pspc and asca sis ) , with different bandpasses and energy resolution .",
    "the different bandpasses allow to explore events across a range of peak temperatures ; if the characteristics of the flaring loops thus derived are similar , this is a strong indication of the corona being dominated by a class of structures .",
    "we have coherently analyzed all the ad  leo flares with sufficient statistics ; the main result is that all six flares originate from similar , compact structures . assuming that the loops which are responsible for the flares are also the main constituent of the active corona , we then constrain its characteristics , in particular regarding the filling factor and the coronal pressure .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : sect .",

    "ad  leo has been observed on several occasions both in the x - ray and uv ( as described in appendix  [ app : prex ] ) . in the present paper",
    "we have analyzed the _ einstein _ , rosat and asca x - ray observations , in all of which significant flaring events were detected .",
    "table  [ tab : dets ] shows a summary comparison of the characteristics of the different detectors , observations and number of flaring events studied in each .",
    "all of the observations discussed here were retrieved from the heasarc archive , and were analyzed using the ftools  4.1 software suite ( except for the pspc flaring spectra which were analyzed using the pros package ) .",
    "spectra and light curves were extracted with the xselect package and the spectral analysis was performed using the xspec  10.0 package and the mekal plasma emission model ( @xcite ) , with ( when necessary ) an interstellar absorption components following the @xcite model . to allow comparison of results obtained with different instruments we will quote all x - ray luminosities both in the instrument s `` own '' band and in a common 0.54.5  kev band .",
    ".the main characteristics of the _ einstein _ ipc , rosat pspc and asca sis detectors ( spectral band and resolution ) , together with the main features of the ad  leo observation performed by each of them ( exposure time , elapsed time , number of analyzed flaring events ) .",
    "[ cols=\">,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : flares ]    the only previously published analysis of flares on ad  leo is the one of @xcite , who studied a significant ( although smaller than the event discussed here ) euve flare , with simultaneous ground - based optical coverage . their analysis is however based on the assumption that during the decay phase the heating rate is negligible in comparison with the natural cooling rate of the flaring loop , so that the light curve is fully dominated by the spontaneous cooling of the loop ( i.e.  @xmath20 , an approximation which @xcite call the `` strong condensation limit '' ) and consequently long rise and decay times require large loop lengths ( @xcite ) . the euve spectrum alone ( given the very low @xmath19 of the continuum ) does not allow to derive the coronal abundance , and",
    "thus @xcite derive the flare parameters under the assumption of @xmath21 and @xmath22 coronal metallicity .",
    "the loop length they derive ( for the first of the two flares they have observed ) is @xmath23@xmath24  cm ( the first value is for @xmath21 , the second for @xmath22 , as in the following ) , the density @xmath25@xmath26  @xmath27 , the pressure @xmath28@xmath29  dyne  @xmath5 , with an equipartition magnetic field @xmath30@xmath31  g. the peak temperature is ( independent of the assumed abundance ) @xmath32  mk",
    ".    the resulting loop lengths are thus significantly larger ( 4 to 11 times ) than the lengths derived from the asca flare  2 ( the one which gives the tightest constraint to the derived physical parameters ) .",
    "although these are distinct events , and thus could in principle result from quite different types of flaring structures , it is worth nothing that for all the x - ray flares analyzed in the present paper there is evidence for substantial heating during the decay phase ( with @xmath33 ranging from @xmath34 to @xmath35 ) ; if these flaring events had been analyzed assuming that @xmath20 the resulting loop lengths would have been over - estimated by factors 2.58 ; on the assumption that the euve flare is of a similar class as the ones observed in x - ray it is likely that equating @xmath36 to @xmath37 will lead to an over - estimate of the loop length by similar factors as in the x - ray case .",
    "the large ( @xmath38 ) loop sizes derived by @xcite for the euve flares would in this case be reduced to the same characteristic size ( @xmath39 ) derived for the x - ray flares , thus again pointing to a narrowly confined characteristic size for the structures of the flaring component of the ad  leo corona .      under the assumption that the flaring loops are similar to solar loops ( i.e.  that their physical parameters are regulated by the same scaling laws of @xcite )",
    "we can derive an estimate for the ratio for the loop s cross - section radius and its length ( which in the solar case is typically @xmath3 , although with a wide range of observed values ) .",
    "this can be done by comparing the pressure derived through the scaling laws with the pressure derived from the flare s emission measure . in the former case",
    "the pressure is obtained by application of the @xcite scaling law    @xmath40    ( which can also be written as @xmath41 ) where @xmath42 is the pressure at the base of the loop , and where the flare s peak temperature and emission measure are used . in the latter case",
    "a simple estimate of the density of the flaring plasma can be obtained by dividing the peak emission measure by the volume of the flaring loop , where the volume is obtained by assuming a given value for @xmath43 , so that    @xmath44    and    @xmath45    under the assumption that the flaring loop at flare maximum is not far from a steady - state condition ( i.e.  that it is almost filled up with flaring plasma ) , the two estimates for the pressure should yield similar results . in table",
    "[ tab : flares ] we report the resulting estimates for each individual flare discussed here , with the pressure and density estimates obtained under the assumption that the loops are similar to the ones observed in the solar - corona , where typically @xmath3 . as it can be seen the assumption of solar - like aspect ratio loops yields pressures which are systematically larger ( and thus volumes that are systematically smaller ) than the pressures derived from the scaling laws .",
    "the factors range from @xmath46 ( for the asca-2 flare ) up to @xmath47 ( for the ipc flare ) .",
    "the two can be reconciled under the assumption of higher @xmath43 values , implying loops which are `` fatter '' , with a resulting @xmath48 .",
    "the larger @xmath43 , if generally applicable , implies lower densities , so that even at the peak of the largest observed flares the plasma likely remains optically thin , justifying the analysis of the spectra without any allowance for self - absorption . in the case of the large ev  lac flare discussed by @xcite the larger @xmath43",
    "would for example imply that the average peak density is @xmath49  @xmath27 .",
    "a simple estimate of the heating released during the flare decay can be obtained as follows : if one assumes uniform heating along the loop the scaling laws of @xcite yield    @xmath50    and the total heating rate at the flare maximum is therefore @xmath51    given that all the events analyzed here display significant heating during the decay , the heating time scale can be approximated as @xmath52 , and an approximate estimate of the total energy released during the flare decay is    @xmath53    if the above analysis is applied to the the flares we have studied ( determining the volume on the assumption of @xmath54 ) the peak volumetric heating rates range ( for the flares for which the length is determined ) between @xmath9 and @xmath55 , and both the peak total heating and the total energy released during the flare are a few times ( @xmath56 ) larger than the peak x - ray luminosity and total radiated energy , showing that radiative losses are not the dominant term in the flare energetics ( similarly to what determined for the large asca flare on ev  lac , @xcite ) .      in the sun the same general class of structures which constitute the active part of the corona",
    "produce the flares . on the assumption that this is also true in the stellar case",
    ", we can use the range of derived properties for the flaring loops of ad  leo to infer the characteristics of the quiescent active corona , and in particular to understand the scaling from the solar picture toward much higher activity levels , i.e.  whether this happens ( mainly ) through an increase in the filling factor , in the characteristic size of the coronal structures or through an increase in the pressure of the plasma filling the loops . the simple picture of a straightforward increase in filling factor , until the star is completely covered with solar - like active regions , can rather naturally explain ( as discussed in detail by @xcite ) the luminosity of `` intermediate activity '' stars : using yohkoh solar images @xcite show that the x - ray luminosity of the solar active regions is @xmath57 , with a filling factor @xmath582% .",
    "thus , by covering a solar - type star with active regions a luminosity of @xmath56@xmath59 can be achieved .",
    "however , such scheme , while appealing in its simplicity , is in contrast with some of the available spectroscopic indicators of coronal structuring ; @xcite for example have analyzed the rosat pspc spectra of active solar - type stars , showing that they are compatible with an active corona being constituted by compact , high - pressure loops with filling factors of few percent ( although low - pressure , larger - pressure loops are also a possible solution ) .",
    "direct pressure measurements of coronal pressure have been performed on a few stars with euve : while low- and intermediate - activity solar - type stars show solar - like densities ( e.g.  @xmath60  eri , @xmath61 to @xmath62  @xmath27 , @xcite ; procyon , @xmath63  @xmath27 , @xcite ) , supporting @xcite s view of an increased filling factor being responsible for higher densities , more active stars ( active binaries ) show evidence for much increased coronal density ( @xmath64  @xmath27 e.g. in 44  boo , @xcite ) , well above the value required to explain the enhanced x - ray luminosity through an @xmath58 corona , and again implying a small @xmath65 in the more active stars .    for a dme star such as ad  leo , with a smaller surface area ( by a factor of 7 with respect to the sun ) the maximum quiescent x - ray luminosity ,",
    "if covered with solar - type active regions is @xmath66@xmath67 , i.e.  still an order of magnitude below the observed values .",
    "thus , another mechanism needs to be postulated to explain the higher x - ray luminosity .",
    "given the compact sizes derived here for the flaring regions ( comparable in relative terms to the solar ones ) , there is no evidence for large loops with significant emissivity and thus for a corona extending to large distances from the star and occupying a large volume .",
    "given the low filling factor we derive for the quiescent component ( see below ) the additional x - ray emissivity is therefore likely to come from an increase in plasma pressure within the same types of ( relatively small ) coronal structures as in solar active regions .",
    "this is also compatible with the high photospheric magnetic fields ( few kg ) measured in dme stars ( @xcite ) , which can easily confine the higher pressure loops required by this picture of the corona .",
    "@xcite have studied the rosat spectra and light curves of several m dwarfs ( including ad  leo ) with the help of semiempirical loop models .",
    "they infer that two distinct thermal components are present in the coronae of m dwarfs , a quiescent cooler one showing negligible time variability , and a hotter flaring one responsible for the observed variability .",
    "the cooler component has a characteristic temperature ( in the pspc spectra ) of @xmath56  mk , while the hotter one has @xmath68  mk .",
    "the cool component can be modeled in terms of small ( @xmath69 ) , high - pressure ( @xmath70 ) loops , while for the hotter component two classes of solutions are possible , i.e.   it can be composed either of large ( @xmath1 ) , high - pressure ( @xmath71 ) loops or of small ( @xmath72 ) loops with a very high pressure ( @xmath73 ) and a very small filling factor ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "again , the former possibility ( a flaring component of the corona composed of large loops ) is not supported by our analysis ; this is also in agreement with the results of @xcite , who have modeled the time - averaged sax lecs and mecs spectrum of ad  leo using static loop models ; they show that the observed spectrum is compatible with being emitted from compact loops ( @xmath75 ) with a small filling factor ( @xmath76 ) .    in the present case",
    "the filling factor for the hotter component can be estimated under the assumption that the corona is largerly composed by loops which satisfy the scaling laws of @xcite ",
    "i.e.   eq .  ( [ eq : rtv ] )  starting from the measured quantities @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . assuming that the loop size ( parameterized as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 ) is now known , the emission measure is linked to the loop size and density by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the number of emitting loops",
    ", @xmath84 is the volume of a single loop and @xmath43 , as before , the aspect ratio of the loop .",
    "if the filling factor is defined as the fraction of the stellar area covered by loops , i.e.     @xmath85    where @xmath86 is cross - section of an individual loop , then eq .  ( [ eq : rtv ] ) can be used to express @xmath65 as a function of the known quantities , i.e.     @xmath87    where the extra factor of 2 accounts for the fact that we only see one hemisphere of the star at any given time .",
    "thus for the hot component of the quiescent emission seen in the asca observation ( @xmath88  @xmath27 ) , and assuming that quiescent loops have the same size as flaring ones ( @xmath89 ) one can derive @xmath90% ( independent of @xmath43 ) .",
    "simple application of the scaling law ( eq .  ( [ eq : rtv ] ) ) also yields estimates for the density ( @xmath91  @xmath27 ) and pressure ( @xmath92  dyne  @xmath5 ) of the `` quiescent '' loops .",
    "our results therefore point to a corona in which the `` hot '' component is composed of loops with comparable relative sizes as the solar active region loops ( i.e.  @xmath0 ) , but with significantly higher pressure ( by approximately an order of magnitude , typical solar active region loop pressures being @xmath93  dyne  @xmath5 ) .",
    "the required filling factor is small , i.e.  only a small fraction of the stellar surface needs to be covered by such loops to explain the observed emissivity .      the initial results from the asca observations of coronal sources , e.g.",
    "that the metal abundance of the coronal plasma is apparently `` non - solar '' has prompted a lively debate about the possible presence of fractionation mechanisms which would deplete the plasma along its way from the photosphere and chromosphere toward the corona .",
    "mechanisms of this type are apparently at work in the sun , were coronal abundance ratios are different from photospheric ones , with elements selectively enhanced on the basis of their first ionization potential ( fip ) .",
    "the solar corona however appears to be in general terms to be metal - enriched , rather than metal - depleted . while there is strong evidence , for example , that the coronal metal abundance changes significantly during large flares ( e.g.  on algol , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , detailed assessments of the relative coronal versus photospheric abundances in stellar coronae have been hindered by the lack of detailed photospheric abundance analyses in most active stars ( even on algol it s unclear if the quiescent coronal abundance is higher or lower than the photospheric value ) .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the often contradictory situation when such analyses are available ( e.g.  the contrasting results about photospheric abundances of active binaries , @xcite versus @xcite ) .    in the case of ad  leo",
    ", the availability of a recent , high - dispersion spectral analysis of the photospheric fe abundance allows a detailed comparison with the coronal abundance as derived from the x - ray observation .",
    "the photospheric metallicity of ad  leo ( @xmath94 } = -0.75 $ ] , @xcite ) is at the low end of the disk population abundance range .",
    "the asca observation shows no evidence for differences between the coronal and photospheric fe abundance .",
    "the coronal abundance ratios are clearly different from the solar photospheric values ( @xmath95 } \\simeq { \\rm [ o / fe ] } \\simeq 4 $ ] ) ; however , while neither si nor o abundance have been determined in the photosphere , @xmath96}$ ] ( the abundance of elements such as si and o , the so - called @xmath97 elements ) is known to be generally enhanced in low - metallicity stars , with @xmath96 } \\simeq 0.4 $ ] at @xmath94 } \\simeq -1.0 $ ] ( see the review of @xcite ) , so that even the `` anomalous '' abundance patterns of the ad  leo corona are in full agreement with the expected photospheric abundance ratios , and therefore no chemical fractionation mechanism is required to explain the observed abundances in the quiescent corona of ad  leo .",
    "our results shows that the frequent flares which have been observed on the `` typical '' dme star ad  leo have all taken place in similar , compact coronal loops . in all cases",
    "sustained heating is present , and the flare decay is dominated by the time evolution of the heating . as a consequence , estimates of the size of the flaring regions found assuming that the loop is decaying undisturbed will significantly overstimate the loop size , by factors ( for the ad  leo flares ) of @xmath9 .",
    "the number of observations is such to allow to estimate the frequency of significant flares in ad  leo : adding to the _",
    "einstein _ , rosat and asca observations discussed here with the exosat observations ( which covered @xmath98  ks% duty cycle , and thus the two data sets are not fully homogeneous , and the resulting flaring rate is only approximate . ] and in which one flare was observed , @xcite ) and with the sax observation ( @xmath99  ks exposure , three flares , @xcite ) , a total of 10 flares have been detected on ad  leo in a total of 480  ks , yielding an average flaring rate of one flare every approximately 50  ks ( which does not include the several minor flaring events visibile both in the pspc and in the sis light - curves ) .",
    "the small range of sizes for the flaring loops ( on the assumption that the same class of loops is also the main component of the active corona ) implies a corona which scales to larger luminosities by filling relatively compact loop structures ( similar to the solar ones ) with progressively higher pressure plasma . a pressure about 10 times the typical value for solar active regions is sufficient , with a small filling factor @xmath90% .",
    "such a scenario is well in agreement with the compact high - pressure loops with @xmath100 which both @xcite and @xcite derive for ad  leo as well as other flare stars through the spectral analysis of the quiescent coronal emission .",
    "these conclusions are somewhat difficult to reconcile with the scenario discussed by @xcite , in which the intermediate activity levels are reached by increasing the filling factor of solar - like ( in size and pressure ) active regions up to @xmath58 .",
    "the approximate filling factor we derive is @xmath100 , and the large emissivity is fully explained by the increase in pressure .",
    "the flare emission can be explained through a significant ( about two order of magnitudes over the quiescent value ) increase in pressure in the same loops responsible for the quiescent emission .",
    "however @xcite based their conclusions on the observation of solar - type stars , where in principle the scaling mechanism to high x - ray luminosity could be different from the one in flare stars .",
    "the discrepancy between the pressure derived for the flaring loops through the application of the @xcite scaling laws and the pressure determined from the peak emission measure and temperature assuming loops with a solar - like aspect ratio ( @xmath3 ) points at the stellar loops having larger volumes for a given length than in the solar case , which can be obtained with a larger @xmath43 , i.e.  with `` fatter '' loops .",
    "a value of @xmath48 is sufficient to reconcile the two estimates of pressure .",
    "the upcoming high spectral resolution observations of the x - ray emission from both the quiescent and flaring emission from flare stars , to be performed with the upcoming _ chandra _ and xmm observatories will allow direct measurements of the plasma pressure for a range of temperatures using selected spectral diagnostics , and thus to test the correctness of the framework presented in the present paper . although high - resolution spectroscopy will certainly be a more powerful method for the study of the coronal structuring of active stars than the study of flare decay , the approach used here will still be important in the _",
    "chandra_-xmm era as it will be applicable to a much larger number of stars ( hence spanning a broad range of stellar parameters ) than high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "also , the pressures derived through high - resolution spectroscopy will be weighted by the plasma emissivity and thus , if significant filamentation within loops is present , can in principle be much higher than the average pressure implied by the loop s length and emission measure ; such evidence has been reported in the solar case ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , comparison of the spectroscopically measured pressures with the flare - derived emission - measures and lengths will constitute a valuable diagnostic of structuring within a single coronal loop .",
    "the quiescent x - ray luminosity of ad  leo is remarkably constant across almost 20  yr , i.e.  between the _ einstein _",
    "ipc observation in 1980 and the 1997 sax observation it ranges from @xmath101  erg  s@xmath15 ( in 1980 ) and @xmath14  erg  s@xmath15 ( in 1996 ) , a remarkably small range also given the diversity of the various instruments used in the comparison .",
    "as recently reviewed by @xcite , active stars show no evidence of a cyclic behavior in their activity level , and indeed ad  leo is no exception .",

    "ad  leo ( gl  388 ) is classified as dm3e ( @xcite ) , and its distance ( from the ground - based parallax , @xcite  ad  leo was nt a hipparcos target ) is 4.9  pc .",
    "no companions to it are known ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is one of the few m dwarfs for which a high resolution abundance analysis of its photospheric spectrum is available : using state of the art model atmospheres and near - ir high - resolution spectra @xcite have estimated the photospheric parameters at @xmath102 , [ z / h]@xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "its measured rotational velocity ( @xmath105  km  s@xmath15 ) places ad  leo among the tail of rare , fast rotating m dwarfs ( @xcite ) ; the photometrically - determined rotational period is 2.7  d ( @xcite .    the bolometric luminosity of ad  leo ( @xcite ) is @xmath106 ( corresponding to a bolometric luminosity @xmath107  erg  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the k - band absolute luminosity is @xmath108 ( from the average apparent k - band magnitude reported by @xcite , and using @xmath109  pc ) , which , through the mass - luminosity relationship of @xcite , yields @xmath110 .",

    "based on the above - mentioned abundance determination we have assumed @xmath114  cm ( @xmath115 ) . at this mass ( @xcite ) , stars are still expected to have a substantial radiative core , so that the interior structure is still `` solar - like '' .",
    "the first x - ray flare on ad  leo was seen with the heao  1 a-2 soft x - ray detector ( @xcite ; who also show that the identification of ad  leo with a quiescent heao  1 source by @xcite was not correct ) .",
    "the approximate flaring x - ray luminosity reported is @xmath116  erg  s@xmath15 , with a peak emission measure of @xmath117  @xmath27 .",
    "the _ einstein _ observation is discussed in sect .  [",
    "sec : einstein ] , while exosat observed ad  leo in four different occasions ( @xcite ) , either as a pointed target or serendipitously , for a total of @xmath98  ks .",
    "the quiescent x - ray luminosity reported was @xmath118  erg  s@xmath15 , and one flare was observed , with a rise time ( @xmath119 ) of 10  min and a decay time of 60  min .",
    "the flare represented a factor of 12 enhancement over the quiescent flux , with peak x - ray luminosity @xmath120  erg  s@xmath15 and a total energy release estimated at @xmath121  erg .",
    "rosat observed ad  leo with the pspc detector on may 8 , 1991 .",
    "the resulting average spectrum was analyzed by @xcite  who used the @xcite plasma emission code  and later re - analyzed by @xcite using the mekal plasma emission code .",
    "the average pspc spectrum ( including the two flaring events ) analyzed with the mekal code is compatible with a two - temperature model with metallicity @xmath122 , best - fit temperatures of 6.6 and 16  mk , and emission measures of @xmath123  @xmath27 and @xmath124  @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the average ( including flares ) x - ray luminosity is @xmath125  erg  s@xmath15 . to fit the spectrum a larger interstellar column density than compatible with the euv observations is required ( @xmath126  @xmath5 ) , similarly to many other coronal sources .",
    "ad  leo was also the target of a day - long sax observation on april 23 , 1997 , discussed by @xcite .",
    "continuous variability is evident in the light curve , with at least three recognizable individual flaring events with enhancements over the `` quiescent '' count rate of @xmath9 times ( in the 1.57.0  kev band ) and decay times of @xmath127 , 4.0 and 4.4  ks , with insufficient counts for a detailed analysis . the total spectrum ( i.e.  including the flaring events ) needs three thermal components to be well fit , with the first two components at temperatures of 3.7 and 12  mk , and a third ( effectively unbound ) component at @xmath128  mk .",
    "the average x - ray luminosity in the 0.17.0  kev band is @xmath129  erg  s@xmath15 .",
    "the sax spectrum can also be fit with static loop models , resulting in two classes of loops , one with @xmath130  mk and the second with @xmath131  mk .",
    "the cooler loops are compact ( @xmath132 ) and with a small filling factor ( @xmath76 ) , while the size and filling factor of the hotter loops in not constrained by the fit .    finally ,",
    "a long euve observation of ad  leo was performed in march 1993 , during which two flaring events where seen , which have been analyzed by @xcite .",
    "their analysis is discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "although less sensitive , the _ einstein _ ipc detector is in many respects similar to the rosat pspc .",
    "the main difference is the lower spectral resolution , with the incoming photon energy being coded in only 15 energy channels .",
    "the approach taken for the analysis of flares seen in ipc data closely mirrors the one used for the analysis of pspc data , described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we will only describe the ipc - specific differences , and refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description .",
    "the essential difference between the approach used for the asca sis data ( for which spectral temperatures are derived from a fit to isothermal models ) and the one used for the pspc and for the ipc is the definition , for the latter two detectors , of a temperature indicator based on a linear combination of the photon counts in each detector channel .",
    "this `` spectral - shape index '' ( ssi ) is obtained through a principal - component analysis , and is , for low - resolution detectors , more robust than a fit to the spectrum .",
    "similarly , the square root of the count rate ( cr2 ) is used as a proxy to the density , so that the @xmath133@xmath134 diagram ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : flare2 ] ) is replaced by a `` cr2ssi '' diagram .    in the case of the ipc",
    "the spectral - shape index has been obtained taking the first 10 pi channels , of which the first 9 are considered as the independent ones .",

    "( [ eq : lzeta ] ) ) is                fig .",
    "[ fig : ipcssit ] shows the dependence of the ipc ssi on the temperature at the top of model hydrostatic loops , analogous to fig .  1 of @xcite , to be applied to infer the flare maximum temperature , which is to be used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lzeta ] ) for deriving the loop length .",
    "the distribution of predicted vs. true model loop lengths is well centered around the correct value ( median @xmath142% ) with a standard deviation of 18% .",
    "simulations analogous to those described in sect .",
    "2.4 of @xcite show that an uncertainty between 10% and 30% ( for 10000 cts per bin ) must be added , depending on the heating time scale @xmath143 ( going from @xmath144 to @xmath145 ) . for 1000 cts per bin",
    "the uncertainties are much larger than with pspc ( @xmath146 ) , likely because the lower spectral resolution induces a large indetermination in the slope in the cr2ssi diagram .",
