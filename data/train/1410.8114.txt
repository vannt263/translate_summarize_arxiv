    "since the first planet discoveries in the 1990s @xcite , more than 1400 planets have been discovered , according to the exoplanet archive @xcite .",
    "_ kepler _ was launched in 2009 and obtained precise photometric measurements for @xmath19 stars with nearly continuous coverage for four years .",
    "more than 3500 candidates have been discovered via the planet transit method @xcite , with nearly 1,000 of them now confirmed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the transit planet search ( tps ) algorithm @xcite has been used to search _ kepler _ stellar light curves for the characteristic dips in flux indicative of a planet . those which meet a certain significance threshold are placed on the threshold crossing event ( tce ) list @xcite .",
    "the tces are further examined and can be upgraded to _ kepler object of interest _ ( koi ) candidate status or downgraded as false positives ( fps ) , which may be erroneous signals or real , astrophysical phenomena like eclipsing binaries @xcite , either on the target star or in the background .",
    "the photometric transit technique can determine the radius of a planet , but generally not the mass and hence does not immediately indicate if a transit signal is due to a planet or a binary star system . in certain cases , these transiting planet candidates can be confirmed as planets through a statistical elimination of astrophysical false positives , such as eclipsing binaries @xcite .",
    "validation by multiplicity has been used on hundreds of candidates in multiple planet candidate systems @xcite .",
    "this method uses the fact that there are very few false positives in multiple transiting planet candidate systems due to the rare occurrence of two independent , unlikely events ( either multiple false positives or a false positive and a true planet ) both occurring for the same star .",
    "however , neither of these methods can determine the planetary masses or orbital parameters , which is necessary for further characterization of the planets .",
    "to date , the only way to determine masses purely from a photometric light curve is through the detection and inversion of ttvs , deviations from a perfectly linear ephemeris due to gravitational interactions of neighboring planets .",
    "( see section  [ sec : ttv ] ) . in this paper , strong ttvs of the planets orbiting ph3",
    "allow for the determination of planetary masses and thus their confirmation as planets .",
    "the planet hunters ( ph ) project is one of the many projects within the zooniverse citizen science program @xcite .",
    "the goal of this project is to assist in the analysis of _ kepler _ lightcurves by complementing the tps algorithmic search with human eyes .",
    "ph breaks _ kepler _ lightcurves into 30 day increments and asks users to mark transit - like signals .",
    "additionally , the talk discussion page allows users to interact with the science team and each other , discuss lightcurves , and even collect certain categories of potential phenomena , such as eclipsing binaries , heartbeat stars , variable stars , microlensing , and circumbinary planets . since december , 2010 , more than 22 million _ kepler _",
    "30-day increment lightcurves have been examined by more than 290,000 public volunteers , amounting to 180 years of 40-hour work weeks .",
    "ph has detected more than 60 new planet candidates , including a large number in their host star s habitable zone ( hz ) @xcite , and two newly confirmed planets @xcite .",
    "the first known _ kepler _ seven planet candidate @xcite was also independently discovered by ph and orbits in a compact , solar system - like arrangement @xcite .",
    "ph s main contribution to the population of _ kepler _ candidates has been in long period candidates .",
    "this is due to the fact that ph users detect one transit at a time , making ph sensitive to even one and two transit systems , whereas computer algorithms typically require three or more transits and build up signal with an increasing number of transits , thus decreasing sensitivity to longer periods .",
    "however , computer algorithms are more robust at identifying smaller planets with transits that are hard to detect by eye . as such",
    ", most ph candidates are approximately neptune - sized or larger , which is where ph approaches completeness for short periods @xcite .",
    "kic 7303287 was first found to have a planet candidate ( koi-1353.01 ) in @xcite , an @xmath20 planet in a 125.87 day orbit .",
    "later , a 34.54 day planet candidate ( koi-1353.02 ) with a radius of @xmath21 was also discovered @xcite .",
    "ph users then noticed an additional 66 day planet candidate , which was later detected as a 330 day tce with a loosely constrained radius of @xmath22 @xcite , an alias of the true period .",
    "ph volunteers also discovered its five hour amplitude ttvs in the transit data and brought it to the attention of the science team via the talk page ( see section  [ sec : agol ] ) .",
    "closer examination of koi-1353.01 showed that outer planet also exhibits ttvs , but with an amplitude of order minutes .",
    "in addition to a sinusoidal component with period equal to the super period , we also can identify a chopping signal in the residuals of the middle planet , allowing us to break the mass - eccentricity degeneracy .",
    "as described below in section  [ sec : agol ] , the inner planet is also confirmed by having a mass upper limit well within the planetary regime .",
    "therefore , koi-1353 is confirmed as ph3  b , c , and d. while in preparation of this paper , @xcite confirmed the inner and outer planets , ph3  b and d , via `` validation by multiplicity '' based on the statistical assessment that multiple transiting signals are unlikely to be false positives .",
    "they were given the names kepler-289 b and c. see table  [ tab : names ] for cross - matching the names of the planets .",
    "furthermore , ph3 d s ttvs were detected at a significant level in @xcite , but they were only able to fit the signal to a parabola rather than a full sine curve .",
    "as such , they do not measure the ttv period or its amplitude .",
    "ph3  c s ttvs were undetected because @xcite only searched through kois .",
    "this system has period ratios of 1.91 ( both the outer / middle and middle / inner period ratios ) , which is somewhat far from the 1:2:4 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) .",

    ", ttvs can determine or provide constraints on the planet masses @xcite .",
    "ttvs of transiting planets can even be used to indicate the presence of non - transiting planets @xcite , co - orbital ( trojan ) planets @xcite , or exomoons @xcite .",
    "ttvs were first used to confirm a pair of planet candidates orbiting kepler-9 @xcite . since then , numerous other _ kepler _",
    "candidates have been confirmed using ttvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    one potential disadvantage of measuring planet masses with ttvs is that , in some circumstances , the masses become degenerate with the eccentricity @xcite .",
    "this occurs when : 1 ) the planet system is close to , but not within , a first - order mean motion resonance ; and 2 ) the measurement errors are significant enough to only detect the sinusoidal ttv caused by the nearby resonance . in this case , the amplitude of the ttv depends both on the planet masses and on the free eccentricity , @xmath24 , which is the component of eccentricity that is not driven by the resonant forcing .",
    "if the @xmath24 is known , the mass is also known .",
    "@xcite examines the degeneracy closely for systems near mmr . in a @xmath25 system",
    ", the ttvs of pairs of interacting planets will be anti - correlated .",
    "if the two sets of ttvs are not anti - correlated , this implies that significant free eccentricities exist .",
    "however , the absence of a phase shift does not necessarily mean that free eccentricities are zero @xcite .",
    "this could instead be an unlikely moment in time when free eccentricities do exist , but their phases cancel out .",
    "if @xmath24 is small , then one can calculate an upper limit on the mass by assuming @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "determining @xmath24 allows one to calculate the true mass .",
    "the mass-@xmath24 degeneracy can also be broken with more precise data .",
    "an @xmath26 ttv signal for a pair of planets near mmr results in a periodic signal ( sinusoidal for cases of low @xmath24 ) .",
    "this period is equal to :    @xmath27    where the outer and inner planets are in a near @xmath28 resonance , respectively , and @xmath29 is a positive integer @xcite .",
    "this period is called the super - period or ttv period .",
    "after one fits the transit midpoints with a linear period and the ttv period , a combination of high quality data and large amplitude ttvs can show the proportionally smaller residual chopping signal @xcite .",
    "this chopping signal is best seen for the inner planet of a near - resonant system and is not seen as strongly in the outer planet , as the position of the inner planet at the time of the outer planet s transit changes very slowly when near a @xmath28 mmr .",
    "the chopping signal scales with the mass of the outer planet @xcite and with the eccentricity @xcite .",
    "this additional constraint allows one to break the mass-@xmath24 degeneracy to calculate the mass of each planet .",
    "using quarters 1 - 16 of the _ kepler _ data , we extracted and flattened each transit using the idl ` autokep ` program @xcite . for the high signal - to - noise transits of the outer planet , we used short cadence data where available .",
    "we then used a new , modified version of the idl program ` tap ` @xcite to fit for the orbital parameters of each planet : impact parameter ( @xmath30 ) , duration ( @xmath31 ) , the ratio of planet radius to stellar radius ( @xmath32 ) , the midtransit times , linear limb darkening , quadratic limb darkening @xcite , and white and red noise .",
    "the ratio of semi - major axis to the radius of the star ( @xmath33 ) and the inclination ( @xmath34 ) can be derived from these parameters . for the purpose of transit fitting ,",
    "circular orbits were assumed , which we found to be a good assumption ( see section  [ sec : agol ] ) .",
    "see figures  [ fig : intransit ] , [ fig : midtransit ] , and [ fig : outtransit ] for the transit fits of ph3  b , c , and d , respectively .",
    "the linear and quadratic limb darkening is very poorly constrained for ph3  b and c when analyzing each planet individually .",
    "therefore , we used the posterior distribution for the linear and quadratic limb darkening from the high signal - to - noise transits ( depth @xmath35  ppm ) of ph3  d s fit as a prior for the inner and middle transit fits",
    ". starspot anomalies are seen in a few transits of ph3  d. we masked out obvious spots , but we did not account for smaller scale starspot anomalies .",
    "this causes a slight residual in the light curve of ph3  d , primarily due to the ninth transit ( see figure  [ fig : outtransit ] ) . for ph3",
    "b , ` tap ` was unable to simultaneously fit for both midtransit times and the orbital properties .",
    "therefore , we fit the phase - folded model first for the orbital parameters . then , holding the orbital parameters fixed , we fit for the midtransit times .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 from the ` tap ` fit is poorly constrained for ph3  b and ph3  c , and their best - fit values are inconsistent with ph3  d s best fit .",
    "for example , ph3  c s @xmath33 is greater than ph3  d s , but it is on an interior orbit ( see table  [ tab : planets ] ) .",
    "therefore , we revise the @xmath33 for each planet using kepler s third law with the planet s period and the stellar parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( derived from stellar density ; see section  [ sec : stellarfit ] ) to get @xmath38 .",
    "the two values agree within errors , the unrevised @xmath33 approximately one @xmath39 higher than @xmath38 .",
    "we use the revised @xmath33 to calculate the planet s incident flux ( @xmath40 ) and semi - major axis ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the best fit transit light curves for ph3  b , c , and d are shown in figures  [ fig : intransit ] , [ fig : midtransit ] , and [ fig : outtransit ] , respectively .",

    "these two planets are near commensurate , but not in resonance .",
    "the observed chopping signal breaks the mass - eccentricity degeneracy for this pair of planets . since the middle planet has the largest amplitude ttv , the mass of the outer planet is constrained more precisely than the mass of the middle planet .",
    "we tested the long - term stability of the system by numerically integrating a random set of 1000 initial conditions which produced ttvs consistent with the _ kepler _ data .",

    "we then determined the maximum full oscillation amplitude for the semi - major axis and eccentricity of each of the planets .",

    "the median eccentricity oscillations of the inner and outermost planet during these integrations were on the order of @xmath188 of the mean value , but the middle planet had large eccentricity oscillations of full amplitude @xmath189 the mean value . out of all the initial conditions ,",

    "although there is no analytic criterion for the stability of three planet systems , one can gain some insight by studying each pair of planets individually .",
    "both the inner pair and outer pair satisfy the two - planet hill criterion for stability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the heuristic three - planet stability criterion used by @xcite for other _ kepler _ systems .",
    "furthermore , neither pair is near a low - order mean motion resonance . although integrations of a length shorter than the age of the system can not prove the system s stability , our tests strongly suggest that these orbits are long - lived .",
    "with such low eccentricities , masses , and period ratios of 1.91 , neither pair of planets is close enough to the 2:1 mean motion resonance for it to substantially affect the dynamics of the system .",
    "it is interesting to also establish how close the system is to a laplace ( or three - body ) resonance .",
    "note , however , that typically , three - body resonances are only important if one or both of the pairs is itself very close to a two - body resonance .",
    "the equation of motion for the three - body resonance angle of the form @xmath192 , where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are integers and @xmath195 is the mean longitude of the planet @xmath34 , resembles at lowest order the angle of a simple pendulum @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for this is written as :    @xmath196    where the coefficients @xmath197 and @xmath198 depend on which @xmath199 resonance is being considered .",
    "therefore , one can approximate the full width of the resonance region ( where the angle @xmath200 oscillates ) simply as @xmath201 .",
    "this can then be converted into a width in terms of the semi - major axis of one of the planets .",
    "we follow the work of @xcite , which focuses on the three - body resonances of circular orbits not near any two - body resonances and which shows that for equal mass planets the width of the resonance in terms of the semi - major axis of the inner planet @xmath202 roughly scales as :    @xmath203}\\ ] ]    with @xmath204 the mass of one of the planets and for semi - major axis ratios of order @xmath205 . in other words , for close pairs of planets the width of the resonance depends linearly on the mass of the planet , relative to the mass of the star , and is significantly larger for closer pairs of planets ( smaller @xmath206 ) . moreover , unless @xmath206 is very small , the widths of the resonances with large values of @xmath193 , @xmath194 will be exponentially small .",
    "this already suggests that the laplace resonance will not be important for ph3 .",
    "we follow the exact formulas given in @xcite , which do not assume equal mass planets , for @xmath198 and @xmath197 to determine how far away the system ph3 is from each @xmath199 three - body resonance .",
    "given the orbital periods of the outer two planets and the masses of all of them , we determine the semi - major axis @xmath207 that the innermost planet would need such that the system would be in exact resonance ( satisfying @xmath208 ) , and we also determine the width of the resonance in terms of the semi - major axis of the innermost planet @xmath209 .",
    "we then computed the number @xmath210 , the dimensionless number of how many resonance widths in semi - major axis of the inner planet the system was away from exact resonance , for each @xmath199 pair , with @xmath211 , @xmath212 .",
    "as expected from equation  [ eq : a1 ] , the resonances with larger values of @xmath199 are entirely negligible .",
    "their widths are too small for the system to be near any of them .",
    "the ph3 system is closest to the three body resonances of the form @xmath213 , with @xmath34 being an integer greater or equal to unity .",
    "however , the system is already @xmath214 widths away even from the @xmath215 resonance and is orders of magnitude further from the majority of the resonances looked at . from this",
    ", we conclude that three - body resonances in this regime ( not near a two - body resonance and with circular orbits ) are unimportant for this system .",
    "to constrain the masses of the interior planets gas envelopes , we consider a scenario wherein they formed by core - nucleated accretion inside the snow - line and consist of an earth - like composition rocky core ( 32% by mass iron and 68% by mass silicate ) surrounded by an h / he envelope . for a given point in planet mass - radius - incident flux",
    "parameter space , planet interior structure models are used to constrain the distribution of each planet s mass between the h / he envelope and the heavy element interior .",
    "we model each planet s interior structure following an approach similar to @xcite , but with updated opacities from @xcite .",
    "an envelope metallicity of @xmath216 solar and a bond albedo of 0.2 are assumed .",
    "we sample the posterior distribution on the envelope mass fraction by 1 ) drawing @xmath217 samples from the planet mass - radius - flux posterior distribution returned by the orbital , stellar , and ttv mcmc fits , and 2 ) computing the envelope mass fraction for each sample from the planet interior structure models .      with the large relative uncertainty in",
    "its measured mass , the bulk compositions that are consistent with the measured properties of ph3  b encompass a wide range of possibilities , including rocky planet , water - planet , and h / he - enshrouded rocky core scenarios .",
    "ph3  b could be a rocky planet with its transit radius defined by a rocky surface ; integrating the posterior probability distribution on ph3b s mass , radius , and incident flux , we find a 16% posterior probability that ph  3b is more dense than a pure silicate sphere .",
    "most of the posterior probability on ph3  b s properties , however , falls in a low - density regime in which the planet must have a volatile envelope comprised of some a combination of astrophysical ices ( dominated by water ) , hydrogen , and helium . at the low - mass extreme",
    ", there is a 12% posterior probability that ph3  b requires a hydrogen - dominated envelope and is less dense than a pure h@xmath218o sphere , but scenarios where the planet consists of a mixture of rock and water are viable at intermediate masses ( and notably at masses near the best fit ) . in the scenario where ph3  b has a rocky earth - like composition heavy element interior surrounded by h / he , the h / he mass fraction of ph3  b is determined to be @xmath219 ( see figure  [ fig : bc ] ) or @xmath220 ( @xmath221 ) .",
    "we find that ph3  c is @xmath18 by mass h / he ( see figure  [ fig : bc ] ) , assuming the planet has a rocky core with no ices .",
    "this corresponds to a radial extent of the h / he envelope of @xmath222 , or @xmath223 .",
    "ph3  c must have a hydrogen - dominated envelope of light gases ; there is less than @xmath224 posterior probability that ph3  c is equal density to or more dense than a pure h@xmath218o body .",
    "@xcite also explore the mass - radius relationship as a function of incident stellar flux , age , and composition .",
    "they find that , at fixed age and flux , the radius acts as a proxy for the composition of neptune - like planets , such as ph3  c ( @xmath225 ) .",
    "ph3  c conveniently falls almost directly on top of one of their provided grid points , ( mass , incident flux , age ) @xmath226 ( @xmath227 , @xmath228 , 1 gyr ) , whereas our derived values are ( @xmath14 , @xmath229 , @xmath160 gyr ( model fit ) or @xmath161 gyr ( gyrochronology ) ) .",
    "@xcite calculates the radius for two metallicities : solar and @xmath230 solar .",
    "ph3 has a metallicity of @xmath116}=0.05\\pm0.04 $ ] , although the atmospheres of neptunes may be significantly enhanced in metal @xcite .",
    "a quadratic interpolation of their grid at ( @xmath227 , @xmath228 , 1 gyr ) finds that the h / he mass fraction is 3.2% for solar metallicity and 2.5% for the enhanced metallicity model , which is consistent with the models we have computed .    the results that ph3  c has a couple percent by mass h / he ( and that ph3  b has no more than a few tenths of a percent by mass h / he ) are robust .",
    "however , errors in the assumed planet energy budget , heavy element interior composition , envelope metallicity , and albedo could lead to small systematic shifts in the quantitative values of the h / he mass fractions quoted .",
    "ph3  d lies in the jovian planet regime ; its composition is dominated by hydrogen and helium .",
    "interpolating among model grids from 1  gyr - old jovian planets from @xcite , we compute the planet core mass for @xmath217 draws from the mass - radius - flux posterior distribution of ph3  d. in this way , we estimate a heavy - element core mass of @xmath231 ( see figure  [ fig : d ] ) , corresponding to an envelope mass fraction of @xmath232 .",
    "we note that @xcite consider fully differentiated planet with cores that are 50% ice and 50% rock by mass .",
    "if the heavy elements are distributed through the planet envelope or are made up of a different mixture of ice and rock , the inferred planet core mass will be affected .",
    "ph3  c avoided proper detection by other transit search routines , very likely due to the bias against detecting planets with large amplitude ttvs @xcite .",
    "this may be the reason why the _ kepler _ pipeline misidentified this planet as a tce with a period five times too large .",
    "the quasiperiodic automated search ( qats ) algorithm @xcite , designed for detecting planets with ttvs , originally missed ph3  c as well due to ph3 s strong stellar variability .",
    "however , an upgraded version of qats can now successfully identify this planet with improved detrending ( e. kruse 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "it is curious that both planet pairs ( outer / middle and middle / inner ) have very near the same period ratio ( @xmath233 ) , with @xmath234 .",
    "there are 127 stars with @xmath235 confirmed planets , in which there are 186 unique sets of three consecutive planets @xcite . only four have the same ratio of period ratios to within 0.385%",
    ". the laplace resonant gj 876 is one of these , as is the laplace resonant candidate system hr 8799 , although it is a directly imaged planetary system with large error bars in period .",
    "the other two are kepler-207 and kepler-229 . in the 174 kois with @xmath235 confirmed candidates , there are 242 unique sets of three consecutive planets .",
    "six of these have the same period ratio to within 0.385% : kois 665 , 757 , 869 , 1151 , 1358 , and 2693 .    for the half of the distribution of the relative difference in the pair - wise period ratios",
    "that is not mathematically truncated at 1.0 ( see the red histogram figure  [ fig : perrat ] ) , a log - normal fit can be reasonably applied to the distribution .",
    "a variable with a log - normal distribution indicates that the variable is the product of many independent , random variables .",
    "however , in the blue population , which includes ph3 , a log - normal does not fit the allowed region of parameter space ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "there is an excess of planet triplets near zero .",
    "this implies that the two populations are affected by different processes .",
    "however , any further analysis of this is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for future studies .        as of now",
    ", there is only one confirmed exoplanet system in a laplace resonance ( @xmath237 4:2:1 mmr ) : gj 876 @xcite .",
    "gj 876 b has a period of 61.12 days @xcite , gj 876 c has a period of 30.09 days @xcite , and gj 876 e orbits every 124.26 days @xcite , while the period ratios of outer / middle and middle / inner of these three planets are the same to three digits , 2.03 .",
    "the laplace resonance of gj 876 was further explored by @xcite , who concluded that gj 876 s laplace resonant solutions are stable , but surrounded by extremely unstable regions .",

    "the third planet in the system confirmed by @xcite has @xmath247 g/@xmath17 and @xmath248 .    the dominant method for discovering these low - mass , low - density planets is via ttv analysis .",
    "however , ttv discoveries may be biased to low density results since , at constant mass , planets with larger radius and thus lower density will be detected more readily and with more precise midtransit times @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of transit detection approximately increases with @xmath249 .",
    "therefore , although more massive planets would create larger , more detectable ttv signals , the balance is likely in favor of a bias towards discovering low density planets .",
    "as noted in @xcite , a number of low - density planets are found near mmr .",
