    "much attention as been paid to entanglement , the purely _ quantum _ part of correlations , since the emergence of the quantum information science . in this context , quantum entanglement can be regarded as a resource for quantum information processors @xcite .",
    "as example of this assertion , entanglement is believed to be the major resource for the acceleration capabilities of quantum processors in performing computation and communication tasks such as teleportation or superdense coding . with this in mind , it is important to note that a typical quantum processor is also a quantum many body system .",
    "thus , the attention that quantum information community has paid in the last years to quantum many body systems intensively studied in condensed matter physics has lead to consider that condensed matter phenomena can be explored from an information theoretic point of view , particularly studying entanglement in quantum many body systems @xcite and using these systems for fruitful operations in quantum communications @xcite and computation protocols @xcite .    in considering the use of many body systems for quantum information applications",
    ", one would ideally like to establish pure entangled states between distant regions , because all quantum protocols such as teleportation @xcite , work best for pure states .",
    "there is also the additional technical advantage that one can use the von neumann entropy of entanglement @xcite , which is a very good measure for pure states to compute the entanglement .",
    "indeed , for ground states which are pure , von neumann entropy has been extensively used to calculate entanglement between complementary parts @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this context",
    "the amount of entanglement obtainable in useful form from these complementary parts for a single copy of a many - body state has also been discussed @xcite . but",
    "for generic distant parts of a qmb system the state is a mixture , so a conversion to a pure state would be ideal .",
    "it would be desirable to achieve this by only local operations on those parts .",
    "of course , in principle , one could use several copies and employ purification protocols , which require local actions as measurements and unitary operations as well as classical communication between the parties , to achieve a smaller number of almost pure states .",
    "however , it is highly desirable that these local operations be simple ( such as projections ) acting on a single copy of an entangled state .    in @xcite",
    "was introduced a new measure of bipartite entanglement called _ localizable entanglement _ ( le ) that is operationally defined as the maximum amount of entanglement that can be localized , on average , between two spins of the chain by performing local measurements on other parties .",
    "studies on the amount of le as a function of the distance of the spins to be entangled and the influence of anisotropic couplings were conducted in @xcite.by definition , the le procedure requires a fine grained access to all the subsystems of the many body system .",
    "this requirement seems rather difficult for typical situations where the subsystems are very close to each other . in this paper",
    "we present a procedure that , in a probabilistic sense , allows us to establish _ pure _ bipartite entangled states between distant regions of many body system by means of _ local _ projections _ only _ on these regions ( fig1 ) .",
    "we consider the state @xmath0 of a system @xmath1 defined on a lattice and the associated density operator @xmath2 .",
    "we can define projective operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 acting locally on separate regions a and b of @xmath1 , where each of them may comprise several lattice sites . the state",
    "after local projection @xmath5 is    @xmath6    by an appropriate choice of the projectors @xmath3 , @xmath4 the state @xmath7 will be pure , and the probability of obtaining this state when performing the associated selective measurement is @xmath8 .",
    "once this pure state is established , the entanglement between regions a and b can be quantified by the von neumann entropy @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath11 where the subscript letters @xmath12 indicate the features projective and pure .",
    "this quantity both captures the probabilistic aspects of this procedure and quantifies the amount of quantum correlations in the resulting state .",
    "the procedure is meaningful only for a choice of the projectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 that are ( i ) suitable for extraction of pure states and ( ii ) of rank higher than one because otherwise one would always obtain an unentangled state .",
    "we shall make these requirements more concise in section [ sec.genproc ] .",
    "in this section we illustrate how the projective procedure can be applied in two simple examples .",
    "supersinglets are defined as @xcite @xmath16 describing a highly entangled state of a number @xmath17 qudits with individual number @xmath18 of degrees of freedom .",

    "it was recently found that supersinglet states also arise as ground states for permutation hamiltonians of systems where @xmath25 ( generalization of two spin-@xmath26 coupled by a heisenberg interaction ) @xcite .",
    "these states are particularly well suited to illustrate the concept of pure entangled state extraction by local projections , as introduced in the previous section . to this end",
    "we choose a simple system of three qutrits ( @xmath27),(labelled a , b and c ) the supersinglet state reads @xmath28 where we defined @xmath29 . by choosing ,",
    "e.g. @xmath30 after projection the qutrits a and b will be left in the pure state @xmath31 for which @xmath32 . in a corresponding selective measurement",
    ", this will happen with probability @xmath33 .",
    "then we find @xmath34 . to hightlight requirement ( ii )",
    ", we stress that by choosing rank-1 projector , e.g. @xmath35 the state after projection will be pure but separable , namely @xmath36 .",
    "rank-3 projectors for a qutrit act trivially as the identity , and leave the subsystems a and b in a maximally mixed state . for general",

    ", we consider a ring of @xmath17 spins interacting through the exchange hamiltonian @xmath38 with periodic boundary conditions @xmath39 @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the pauli @xmath43 matrices .",

    ", there is certain probability that one of the spin flips lies within the region a and the other one lies within the region b. by projecting the evolved state by means of two coarse grained measurements on these regions ( middle ) , an entangled pure state between a and b can be established when the results of the measurements ascertain that one spin flip is in a and the other one in b while saying nothing about their exact localization within a and b ( bottom ) .",
    "[ fig2 . ] ]    the objective of our procedure is to create a pure entangled state between two separate regions a and b of the ring by projecting ( [ evolvedstate ] ) with two local coarse grained measurements which ascertain whether there is some flip present in certain region without revealing any information about its position within the region ( see illustration in fig .  [ fig2 . ] ) .",
    "this procedure discards trials in which no flips are found in any region or only one of the flips is found in one the measurement regions .",
    "the projected state after measurement is the result of selecting the cases in which we find one flip in a and the other one in region b. this setting of our projection procedure can be made more concise by explicitely writting the projectors as @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "so , taking into account ( [ evolvedstate ] ) and ( [ amplitude ] ) the state after projection @xmath64 can be written as    @xmath65    with @xmath66 and also noting that @xmath67 .     *",

    "the probability for obtaining the state ( [ projstate ] ) in our procedure also easily reads as @xmath72 where _ r _ refers to all sites in the ring .",
    "this probability can be interpreted as the probability of success of the procedure .",

    "let us examine under which circumstances locally measuring the parity in regions a and b can lead to a pure entangled state ( for simplicity restricting ourselves to the isotropic @xmath156 case , where the number of spin flips @xmath157 is conserved ) .",
    "an important role must be attributed to the particular partitioning we chose above , i.e. the complement of the measurement regions is comprised of merely two sites .",
    "if the parity of regions a and b is even @xmath158 , then the complementary spins must be of odd parity @xmath159 , to comply with the global odd parity of ground state .",
    "the local measurements of parity must not discriminate between the particular configurations which is a necessary requirement of having an entangled state after projection , and is equivalent to the aforementioned necessity of having local projectors of rank higher than one .",
    "then , measuring even parity in both regions a and b ( @xmath160 ) is consistent with four possible spin configurations , which occur with equal amplitudes in the ground state , thus after projection the state of the whole system reads @xmath161 which was verified numerically .",
    "the state of regions a , b is therefore pure and entangled , which is clear by inspection .",
    "this study therefore sheds light on the interrelation between @xmath15 and observables that commute with the underlying hamiltonian , and further have a degenerate spectrum .",
    "we stress that our study has primarily been conducted , at the current stage , for conceptual purposes .",
    "whether nonzero @xmath15 exists in more realistic or potentially useful settings can not be said at this point .",
    "the non equilibrium setting of section [ locquench ] shows qualitative similarities to the features after a _ local quench _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . calabrese and cardy recently proposed @xcite a simple interpretation for the observed behavior in terms of quasiparticle excitations emitted from the initial state at @xmath162 that freely and semiclassicaly propagate with velocity @xmath163.if the initial state is separable ( in the standard basis ) particles that originate from different sites are incoherent , but pairs of particles moving to the left or right from a given point are highly entangled .",
    "the reasoning of these authors is that a point @xmath164 in region @xmath165 will be entangled with a point @xmath166 in region @xmath167 if a pair of entangled particles emitted at an earlier time arrive simultaneously at @xmath164 and @xmath166 .",
    "this picture of a _ causal cone _ is capable of qualitatively explaining the observed saturation of the block entropy of contiguous blocks of spins in an infinite chain after the quench @xcite .",
    "it is thus tempting to qualitativeley interpret the results of section ( [ locquench ] ) where a saturation is observed ( for a time window before finite size effects kick in).our procedure of selecting particular measurements outcomes assures that these excitations have arrived to regions @xmath165 and @xmath167 at the instant of measurement which , in agreement with the quasiparticle picture , may lead to entanglement after a time that scales linearly with the distance between these regions due to the finite speed for the propagation of the excitations @xmath163 .",
    "more importantly such a measurement does not discriminate particular points @xmath164 and @xmath166 within these regions , and therefore the quantum indeterminacy ( owing to the time evolution ) is what gives us the possibility for establishing a pure entangled state between @xmath165 and @xmath167 .",
    "the growth and later saturation of entanglement entropy between blocks @xmath165 and @xmath167 can be viewed from the fact that due to time evolution , there is an instant @xmath168 at which there is a nonzero and non increasing probability that the excitations have arrived to all the points @xmath164 and @xmath166 lying within regions @xmath165 and @xmath167 .    as particularly highlighted in sec [ sec.genproc ]",
    "a vital aspect of @xmath15 is its connection to good quantum numbers , which may lead to a similar quantum indeterminacy as mentioned for the dynamic case above .",
    "this can arise for the ground state of a qmbs if the underlying hamiltonian commutes with an observable that has a degenerate spectrum , like in our cases the magnetization or parity .",
    "if these observables can also be measured locally , and the local measurement outcomes are again consistent with more than one global state configuration ( degeneracy ) , we have shown that this indeterminacy can be exploited in that it may lead to pure entangled states of different regions of the mbs after the measurement .",
    "so we are deliberately measuring some _ incomplete _ set of commuting observables locally , which will maintain the ( quantum ) uncertainty of telling in which particular state the subsystem resides is maintained .",
    "as these local measurements are performed on both separated regions , the projected state has to accomplish both local degeneracies simultaneously which is the origin of the nonlocal quantum correlation .",
    "under which circumstances this quantum correlation is that of a pure state is connected rather subtly to an interplay of the observable being measured , the partitioning of the system into measurement regions a , b and their complement and the global properties of the state .    another interesting point to discuss",
    "is the topic related with the transferring of entanglement created by our procedure to systems in which this entanglement could be used as a resource for quantum information tasks . in other words , what we would like to do is to be able to swap the entanglement established between regions @xmath165 and @xmath167 onto a couple of related systems @xmath169 and @xmath170 . in @xcite ,",
    "authors propose a protocol by which the entanglement between separated regions in an ion trap could be transferred to a pair of ancillary ions each one of them related with each one of the regions.further investigations should clarify if the above kind of operations feasibly allow to use the entanglement extracted by our procedure in quantum information tasks .",
