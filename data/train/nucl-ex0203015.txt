    "phase instabilities near the qcd phase transition can result in non - statistical fluctuations that are detectable in final state observables  @xcite .",
    "these instabilities , which may occur due to random color fluctuations @xcite , critical behavior at the qcd tri - critical point  @xcite , or fluctuations from the decay of a polyakov loop condensate  @xcite , can result in a broadening of the transverse momentum or transverse energy distributions of produced particles for different classes of events .",
    "this phenomenon is expected to be detected experimentally by searching for deviations of the distributions of the event - by - event mean transverse momentum @xmath3 or mean transverse energy @xmath4 of produced particles from the random distributions expected for statistically independent particle emission .",
    "an event - by - event analysis of @xmath3 was previously performed for @xmath5gev / c pb+pb collisions at the cern sps by experiment na49  @xcite . in that analysis ,",
    "the @xmath3 distributions measured over the rapidity range @xmath6 and @xmath1 range @xmath7gev / c , were found to be consistent with random fluctuations .",
    "na49 also performed an event - by - event analysis of the @xmath8 ratio @xcite , showing only very small deviations from random fluctuations . with an increase of @xmath9 to @xmath10gev in rhic collisions , unprecedented energy densities have been observed  @xcite , hence conditions may be more favorable for a phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma which may be indicated in non - random fluctuations .",
    "presented here is an event - by - event analysis of @xmath3 fluctuations and the first measurement of @xmath4 fluctuations at mid - rapidity at rhic .",
    "the phenix experiment  @xcite consists of four spectrometers designed to measure simultaneously hadrons , leptons , and photons produced in nucleus - nucleus , proton - nucleus , and proton - proton collisions at rhic .",
    "the two central arm spectrometers , which are located within a focusing magnetic field and each cover @xmath11 in pseudorapidity and @xmath12 in azimuthal angle , are utilized in this analysis .",
    "the primary interaction trigger was defined using the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite and zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite .",
    "events are selected with a requirement that the collision vertex along the beam axis has @xmath13 cm as measured by both the bbc and zdc .",
    "event centrality is defined using correlations in the bbc and zdc analog response as described in  @xcite . for the present analysis , the events",
    "are classified according to the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 most central events .",
    "the drift chamber  @xcite is used in conjunction with the innermost pad chamber , called pc1 , to measure the transverse momentum of charged particles traversing the phenix acceptance .",
    "a fiducial section of the drift chamber is chosen to minimize the effect of time - dependent variations in the performance of the detector during the data - taking period .",
    "the fiducial volume of the @xmath3 analysis spans an azimuthal range of @xmath18 and covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath19 .",
    "reconstructed tracks  @xcite are required to contain a match to a hit in pc1 to insure that the tracks are well reconstructed in three dimensions for reliable momentum determination .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution is determined from clusters reconstructed in the two instrumented sectors of the lead - scintillator electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 is defined as the transverse energy per reconstructed calorimeter cluster as described in  @xcite , which can include clusters that have been merged .",
    "the effects of cluster merging on the @xmath4 distribution are discussed later .",
    "the fiducial volume of the @xmath4 analysis spans an azimuthal range of @xmath20 and covers @xmath21 .",
    "there are no acceptance nor efficiency corrections applied to the semi - inclusive @xmath1 or @xmath2 distributions prior to the calculation of @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "these corrections do not vary from event to event and are identical for data and mixed events ; therefore they do not modify the values of the fluctuation quantities defined later .",
    "the @xmath3 distributions are calculated using the formula @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of tracks in the event that pass the cuts outlined above and lie within the @xmath1 range @xmath24gev / c .",
    "similarly , the @xmath4 distributions are calculated using the formula @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of calorimeter clusters in the event that lie within the @xmath2 range @xmath27gev .",
    "an event is excluded from the analysis if @xmath23 or @xmath26 is below a minimum value to insure that there are a sufficient number of tracks or clusters to determine a mean and to exclude background events .",
    "this minimum value for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 centrality classes , respectively , is 40 , 30 , 20 , and 10 for the @xmath3 analysis and 30 , 20 , 10 , and 10 for the @xmath4 analysis .",
    "table i lists statistics pertaining to the data samples used to determine @xmath3 and table ii lists the statistics pertaining to the data samples used to determine @xmath4 .",
    "the events used for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 analyses are considered independently of each other .    in order to compare the @xmath3 and @xmath4 distributions to what is expected for statistically independent particle emission ,",
    "mixed events are considered as the baseline for the random distribution . to obtain a precision comparison ,",
    "it is important to match the number of tracks or clusters along with the mean of the semi - inclusive distribution of the mixed events to that of the data .",
    "therefore , in both analyses , mixed events are constructed by pre - determining the number of charged particle tracks or calorimeter clusters in the mixed event @xmath28 by directly sampling the corresponding data @xmath23 or @xmath26 distributions .",
    "figure 1 shows a comparison of the @xmath23 distributions from the data and the normalized mixed event @xmath28 distribution for the @xmath15 centrality class .",
    "once @xmath28 is determined , a mixed event is filled with @xmath1 or @xmath2 values from the data with the following criteria : a ) no two @xmath1 or @xmath2 values from the same data event are allowed to reside in the same mixed event , b ) only @xmath1 or @xmath2 values passing all cuts in the determination of @xmath3 or @xmath4 from the data events are placed in a mixed event , and c ) only data events from the same centrality class are used to construct a mixed event corresponding to that class .",
    "once a mixed event is filled with @xmath28 tracks or clusters , its @xmath3 or @xmath4 is calculated in the same manner as for the data events .    for both analyses ,",
    "the data contain a fraction of tracks or clusters within close physical proximity that have merged into a single track or cluster .",
    "this fraction is estimated by embedding simulated single - particle events that are processed through a detailed simulation of the detector response into real data events , which are then reconstructed in the same manner as the data .",
    "for the @xmath14 centrality class , we estimate that 6% of the tracks and 5% of the clusters are affected .    for the @xmath3 analysis ,",
    "tracks that are merged into a single reconstructed track typically have similar values of @xmath1 .",
    "the result is a slightly lower value of @xmath23 which causes a slight broadening in the width of the @xmath3 distribution due to the reduced statistics per event .",
    "however , since the @xmath23 data distribution is directly sampled during the construction of mixed events , the effect of merged tracks cancels for comparisons between the data and mixed events .    for the @xmath4 analysis , the effect of merged clusters is complicated by the fact that a single cluster is reconstructed with an @xmath2 corresponding to the sum of the two ( or more ) particles contributing to the cluster . to understand this effect on the mixed events , we note that the fraction of merged clusters within a data event increases with event multiplicity .",
    "also , many of the data events with the lowest @xmath4 coincide with the lowest multiplicity events since they contain few , if any , merged clusters that would yield a higher @xmath4 . when the merged clusters in the data events are randomly redistributed among the mixed events",
    ", low multiplicity mixed events can contain more merged clusters than the data events with the same multiplicity , resulting in a gross upward shift in @xmath4 for those mixed events .",
    "this results in apparent excess non - random fluctuations at low @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , high multiplicity mixed events can contain fewer merged clusters than the data events with the same multiplicity , resulting in a gross downward shift in @xmath4 for those mixed events .",
    "however , since the mean is taken over more clusters in this case , the effective shift in @xmath4 is reduced at high @xmath4 , and the apparent non - random fluctuations are much less pronounced .",
    "an estimate of the magnitude of this effect is presented later .",
    "to compare directly the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution to the @xmath3 distribution assuming statistically independent particle emission , the closed form prescription outlined in  @xcite is used .",
    "this prescription describes the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution using a gamma distribution , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters that are related to the mean and standard deviation of the semi - inclusive distribution as @xmath32 where @xmath33 the reciprocal of @xmath31 is the inverse slope parameter of the @xmath1 distribution . with",
    "the track multiplicity distribution assumed to be a negative binomial distribution , , the @xmath3 distribution can be calculated using @xmath34 where the loop is over @xmath23 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , which are the limits of the multiplicity .",
    "the value of the negative binomial distribution parameter @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 therefore , given @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 extracted from the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution , the expected random @xmath3 distribution can be calculated .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath3 distribution for the @xmath14 centrality class .",
    "overlayed on the data as a dotted curve is the result of the calculation .",
    "the agreement between the data distribution and the calculation illustrates the absence of large non - statistical fluctuations in the data .",
    "the remainder of this article will quantify the amount of non - statistical fluctuations observed and place limits on the level of fluctuations that can be present in central au+au collisions at @xmath0gev .    to quantify the magnitude of the deviation of fluctuations from the expectation of statistically independent particle emission",
    ", the magnitude of the fluctuation @xmath42 in the transverse quantity @xmath43 , representing @xmath3 or @xmath4 , is defined as @xmath44 the value of @xmath42 is calculated independently for the data distribution and for the baseline , or mixed event , distribution . the difference in the fluctuation from a random baseline distribution is defined as @xmath45 the sign of @xmath46 is positive if the data distribution contains a correlation , such as bose - einstein correlations  @xcite , when compared to the baseline distribution .",
    "the fraction of fluctuations which deviate from the expectation of statistically independent particle emission is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 refers to the standard deviation of the event - by - event @xmath43 data distribution and @xmath49 is the corresponding quantity for the baseline , or mixed event , distribution . in the absence of a common language for the analysis of @xmath3 and @xmath4 fluctuations , the commonly used fluctuation quantity @xmath50  @xcite is also presented in order to compare this measurement to previous results  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is related directly to @xmath50 via @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents @xmath23 or @xmath26 .",
    "the quantity @xmath50 is related to @xmath53 by @xmath54 the standard deviation of the semi - inclusive spectra can be approximated by @xcite , where @xmath55 is the standard deviation of the semi - inclusive distribution as defined in eq .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 is simply the fraction of non - random fluctuations in the event - by - event mean @xmath1 or @xmath2 , @xmath53 , scaled by @xmath55 .",
    "an advantage of @xmath53 over @xmath50 is that measurements expressed in @xmath53 can be directly compared without further scaling .",
    "the magnitudes of any non - random fluctuations are established by comparing the data distributions to the mixed event distributions , which serve as the random baseline distributions .",
    "for this purpose , the mixed event distributions are normalized to minimize the @xmath56 value with respect to the data distributions .",
    "figure 3 and figure 5 show the @xmath3 and @xmath4 distributions for all four centrality classes ( data points ) with the corresponding mixed event @xmath3 and @xmath4 distributions overlayed on the data as dotted curves .",
    "the broadening of the distributions for less central collisions are due to the reduction in @xmath41 or @xmath57 . shown in figure 4 and figure 6",
    "are the residuals between the data and mixed events , defined for each bin @xmath58 as , in units of standard deviations , for each centrality class .",
    "the shapes of the residual distributions are primarily driven by the normalization procedure applied to the mixed events .    for the @xmath3 distributions ,",
    "the data and mixed event distributions are indistinguishable .",
    "however , the upper @xmath4 edges of the data and mixed event @xmath4 distributions show good agreement while the lower @xmath4 edge of the data distributions are slightly wider than the mixed event distribution .",
    "if this low @xmath2 effect were physical , it would imply fluctuations with slightly more low @xmath2 photons since the effect is not seen in the @xmath3 distribution for charged particle tracks .",
    "however , some of the excess fluctuations at low @xmath2 can be attributed to the effects of cluster merging previously discussed .",
    "the magnitude of this effect has been investigated using a monte carlo simulation which calculates @xmath4 after reproducing the calorimeter cluster separation distribution , the @xmath26 distribution , and the semi - inclusive @xmath2 distributions from the data .",
    "the fluctuations in the @xmath4 distribution with this effect included in each event are compared to a simulated mixed event @xmath4 distribution constructed from the same generated dataset using the same procedure that is applied to the data . in this manner , it is estimated that the cluster merging effect contributes an additional @xmath53 = 1.5% , 2.1% , 0.9% , and less than 0.01% to the non - random fluctuations for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 centrality classes , respectively .",
    "the simulation confirms that the cluster merging effect significantly contributes only to the lower @xmath4 edge of the distribution .",
    "the remainder of the excess low @xmath2 fluctuations is likely due to correlated low energy background .",
    "geant  @xcite simulations indicate that the primary background contribution is produced by low energy electrons and muons that scatter off of the pole tips of the central arm spectrometer magnet but still pass the cluster selection cuts . because of the difficulty in quantifying the contribution of background to the excess fluctuations , the present @xmath4 data are taken to indicate an upper limit on non - statistical fluctuations rather than an indication of true non - statistical fluctuations .",
    "the values of @xmath59 , @xmath46 , @xmath53 , and @xmath60 for each centrality class using the mixed events as the random baseline distribution are tabulated in table iii for @xmath3 and table iv for @xmath4 .",
    "the errors quoted for these quantities include statistical errors and systematic errors due to time - dependent variations over the data - taking period .",
    "the systematic errors are estimated by dividing each dataset into nine subsets with each subset containing roughly equal numbers of events . for the @xmath3 analysis",
    ", the systematic errors contribute to 81% , 88% , 76% , and 75% of the total error in @xmath59 and 85% , 88% , 80% , and 85% of the total error in the variables @xmath46 , @xmath53 , and @xmath61 for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 centrality classes , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values for the @xmath4 analysis are a 67% , 63% , 81% , and 82% contribution to the total errors in @xmath42 , and a 64% , 63% , 81% , and 82% contribution to the total errors in @xmath46 , @xmath53 , and @xmath61 for each centrality class .",
    "the cluster merging contribution estimates noted above are not applied to the values quoted in table iv .",
    "based upon the fluctuation measurements presented here , certain fluctuation scenarios in rhic au+au collisions at @xmath0gev are excluded . for this purpose , we consider two variations of a model that contains two classes of events with a difference of effective temperature , defined as , where @xmath62 is the inverse slope parameter of the event class with the higher effective temperature , and @xmath63 is the inverse slope parameter of the event class with the lower effective temperature . the first variation , _ model a _ , will consider a case where the means of the semi - inclusive @xmath1 spectra for the two event classes are identical , but the standard deviations are different . the second variation , _ model b _ , will consider a case where the means of the semi - inclusive @xmath1 spectra are different , but the standard deviations are identical .",
    "since the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution is an observed quantity , the two event classes must be constrained in such a way that the mean and standard deviation of the final semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution remains constant while the effect of the fluctuation manifests itself in the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "the dual event class model is applied to the determination of the sensitivity to fluctuations in @xmath3 for the @xmath14 centrality class as follows .",
    "returning to the prescription outlined in  @xcite , the semi - inclusive transverse @xmath1 spectrum can be parameterized by the @xmath64 distribution defined in eq .",
    "3.1 . for both model variations ,",
    "the fraction of events in the event class with the higher effective temperature is defined as @xmath65 the @xmath1 distribution of the combined sample can then be expressed as @xmath66 where and .    for model",
    "a , the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distributions of each event class are constrained to have the same mean , so we require @xmath67 the variance of the final semi - inclusive @xmath1 distribution for model a is constrained by @xmath68 with these constraints , the choice of a value for @xmath69 and the effective temperature of one event class is sufficient to extract the remaining parameters from which sensitivity estimates for fluctuations in @xmath3 are obtained .    for model",
    "b , the semi - inclusive @xmath1 distributions of each event class are allowed to have different means , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , so the mean of the total semi - inclusive distribution can be expressed as . defining a mean shift , @xmath72 , as @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74 allowing @xmath75 = @xmath76 and applying the constraint that the variances of the two event classes are identical , yields @xmath77 with a choice of values for @xmath69 and @xmath72 , the remaining parameters can be calculated , including @xmath78 .",
    "both variations of the dual event class model are implemented in a monte carlo simulation in the following manner .",
    "the number of particles in an event is determined by sampling the @xmath23 data distribution , approximated by a gaussian distribution fit to the data .",
    "the @xmath1 of each particle in an event is determined individually by sampling the appropriate @xmath79 distribution fit to the semi - inclusive @xmath1 data distribution , which yields @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath14 centrality .",
    "the @xmath1 of each particle is restricted to the @xmath1 range of the measurement . with @xmath23 and",
    "the @xmath1 distribution determined , the @xmath3 for a given number of events is calculated .",
    "the generated @xmath3 distribution with @xmath82 for either model variation is found to be statistically consistent with the mixed event @xmath3 distribution .",
    "the data contain a fraction of background particles that did not originate from the collision vertex that effectively dilute the sensitivity to non - random fluctuations . to address this ,",
    "a fraction of the particles in an event are randomly tagged as background particles , whose @xmath1 distribution is then generated with a separate parameterization prior to calculating @xmath3 for an event .",
    "the level of background contamination is estimated by processing hijing  @xcite au+au events through a software chain that includes a detailed geant simulation  @xcite with the complete phenix detector geometry included , followed by a detailed simulation of the detector electronics response  @xcite , whose output is then processed by track , cluster , and momentum reconstruction using the identical software and input parameters as is used for the data analysis .",
    "it is estimated that 11% of the tracks and 26% of the clusters are due to background particles , independent of centrality class over the centrality range of these measurements .",
    "the estimated @xmath1 and @xmath2 distributions for the background particles are well parameterized by exponential distributions .",
    "again , the majority of the @xmath2 background occurs at low @xmath2 , so any correlated background would most likely contribute to the lower side of the @xmath4 distribution .    to determine the sensitivity to fluctuations within the dual event class model , the fluctuation fraction , @xmath69 , and the value of @xmath75 for model a and @xmath72 for model b",
    "are varied and the @xmath3 distribution is generated at each step .",
    "a chi - square test is then performed on the generated @xmath3 distribution with respect to the mixed event data @xmath3 distribution . for a given value of @xmath69 , the @xmath56 result increases as @xmath78 increases , which allows a fluctuation exclusion region to be defined for the single degree of freedom .",
    "the curves in figure 7 show the lower exclusion boundaries for the @xmath14 centrality @xmath3 measurement at the 95% confidence level as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath78 for both variations of the model . if the sensitivity is determined based upon the non - mixed data distribution , the lower exclusion boundary increases by less than 2 mev for all values of @xmath69 for either model .",
    "also , for all values of @xmath69 in either model , the estimated background contribution degrades the sensitivity estimates by @xmath78 = 3 mev for both models .    a recent model of event - by - event fluctuations where the temperature parameter @xmath83 fluctuates with a standard deviation @xmath84 on an event - by - event basis  @xcite , can be simply related to @xmath53 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the semi - inclusive parameter extracted from the present data . for the @xmath14 centrality class ,",
    "the present measurement establishes a 95% confidence limit of for , or 5% for .",
    "the fluctuations in the @xmath3 distributions for all centrality classes are consistent with the presence of no fluctuations in excess of the random expectation .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath53 in all cases is positive , which may be due to the presence of hanbury - brown - twiss correlations .",
    "the fluctuations in the @xmath4 distributions do have a small non - statistical component , much of which is attributable to the effects of merged clusters , the remainder of which are taken to indicate an upper limit on non - statistical fluctuations in transverse energy . by defining a dual event class model , limits are set on the amount of @xmath3 fluctuations that can be present in the angular aperture @xmath19 and @xmath18 in @xmath0gev au+au collisions . during the rhic run of 2001 , phenix has taken data for @xmath87gev au+au collisions with about a factor of four increase in azimuthal angular acceptance for both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 analyses , which will allow the measurements to be extended toward more peripheral collisions .",
