    "cavity emission is considerably enhanced when the qd is detuned to the right of the cavity mode as the cavity - qd coupling is further strengthened by phonon emission processes . at a detuning of @xmath1171  mev , the red - detuned cavity peak is found to be about double that of the blue detuned cavity mode peak , which is consistent with experimental data using incoherent excitation , e.g. , as shown by hennessy _",
    "et al . _",
    "also note that the cavity - mode peak initially increases , relative to the mollow triplet , as the qd exciton is red detuned from the exciton ; but eventually decreases for sufficiently large qd - cavity detunings .",
    "this suggests that the coupling between the qd and the cavity is optimum at a particular detuning and is determined by the qd - phonon coupling strength and the intrinsic spectral properties of the phonon reservoir .",
    "this observation is significant for experimentalists as it suggests that off - resonance cavity - qed physics is best studied at a particular qd - cavity detuning where the mode emission is maximized .",
    "note that the emission at the cavity mode frequency is eventually suppressed at very large qd detunings @xmath118 mev , which is in agreement with recent experimental observations on site - controlled qds in cavities  @xcite ; however , these measurements were again carried out using incoherent excitation , so not in the domain of resonance fluorescence .",
    "the maximum coupling between the qd and the cavity also depends on temperature , e.g. , the qd - cavity detuning at which the qd - cavity mode coupling is maximum increases with temperature .",
    "it is informative to note that the detuning dependence of the spectra closely follows the spectral characteristics of the phonon correlation function . an intuitive way to understand this detuning dependence is using effective phonon rates in a lindblad - type description  @xcite , which are similar to the cavity - feeding rates introduced in refs .  .",
    "these phonon scattering rates are related to the fourier component of the phonon correlation function at the qd - cavity mode detuning .",
    "the same type of feature can be seen in the asymmetry of the sidebands of the vacuum - rabi doublet in an incoherently pumped strongly coupled qd - cavity system  @xcite ; the asymmetry of the doublet depends closely on the spectral characteristics of the phonon correlation function .",
    "hence , these features in the fluorescence spectra and linear absorption reveal subtle details of the underlying phonon reservoir , which can be probed as a function of the exciton - cavity detuning .",
    "the advantage of coherently excited systems is that they are much cleaner to study , since for incoherent excitation one never really knows the details of the pumping scenario ( which may involve a number of exciton states and contributions from different qds ) .",
    "mev , with the phonon reservoir temperatures : @xmath119  k , @xmath120  k , @xmath121  k , and @xmath122  k. the other parameters are the same as in fig .  [",
    "fig : master1 ] . ]          in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] we investigate the temperature dependence of the resonance fluorescence spectra and also analyse the role of one - phonon scattering versus multiphonon scattering . in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp](a ) , we show the red - detuned cavity mode , where the grey ( solid ) lines denote the one - phonon limit of the full polaron cavity - emitted spectra which is shown with the red ( dark ) line .",
    "we observe that the emission at the cavity mode relative to the emission at the qd frequency increases with temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp](b ) , we plot the qd exciton spectra , where the full - polaron qd spectra is now plotted as the blue ( dark ) lines .    the one - phonon limit of the full - polaron me is obtained by a perturbative expansion of the relevant phonon correlation functions to lowest order ; namely , we approximate @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the tc markov me is then solved numerically for the above choice of phonon correlation functions to study the fluorescence spectra in the one - phonon limit . in the weak phonon coupling theory , @xmath125 , suggesting that one - phonon processes do not renormalize the rabi frequency of the cw - laser drive , @xmath13 , or the qd - cavity coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "the discrepancy between the one - phonon and full - polaron solution of the tc me increases with temperature , and the one - phonon solution is found to _ overestimate _ the eid in comparison with the full polaron solution .",
    "these results are consistent with the findings of mccutcheon and nazir  @xcite , who adopt a polaron me for analysing qd rabi oscillations in the presence of acoustic phonon scattering ( with no cavity ) . note that since the one - phonon truncation for the full polaron theory does not renormalize the laser rabi frequency , the locations of the triplets are identical to that for the case of no phonons .",
    "hence a full polaron theory can be essential to find the correct center frequencies of the mollow triplet resonances .",
    "moreover , the discrepancy between the sideband locations increases with temperature .",
    "however , the weak phonon theory can obtain accurate simulations of the cavity resonance , depending upon the exciton - cavity detuning . without any acoustic phonon coupling ,",
    "the mollow spectra are significantly different , e.g. , there is no eid and there is negligible oscillator strength at the cavity mode .",
    "these results suggest that a simple atomiclike me would drastically fail in the present semiconductor cavity - qed excitation regime .          in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we display the normalized resonance fluorescence spectra for various cw laser drives and dot - cavity couplings , using a fixed qd - cavity detuning .",
    "the temperature of the bath is at @xmath107k . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra](c ) , we observe that the relative emission at the cavity mode frequency increases with increasing drive which is caused by the enhanced coupling between the cavity mode and the qd , as the low energy triplet component is pushed closer to the cavity mode frequency .",
    "the mollow triplet peak which is proximal to the cavity mode has a higher spectral weight than the distant component which is due to stronger relative coupling with the cavity mode .",
    "however , we note that the asymmetry in the spectral weights decreases for larger @xmath12 as both the proximal and the distant component of the triplet are more or less equally coupled to the cavity mode . for increasing pump strengths",
    ", it is clear that the linewidth broadening is larger in the presence of phonons .",
    "further increased broadening of the mollow sideband occurs with increasing @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "apart from the lack of any emission at the mode frequency in the qd emission spectra , the asymmetry in the mollow triplets in @xmath126 is substantially smaller than @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , the high energy component of the triplet has a larger relative spectral weight than the low energy component .",
    "this asymmetry in the sidebands spectral weights increase with increasing @xmath12 and cw - laser drive @xmath13 .",
    "also , the asymmetry of the sidebands are not mainly due to phonon - induced effects as they are present even in the absence of phonons ; thus these features are primarily cavity coupling effects and are easy to understand in terms of relative coupling with the cavity mode .",
    "the low - energy component of the triplet is closer to the cavity mode and couples more strongly with it .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : detuning ] we study @xmath114 and @xmath126 for different exciton - laser detunings , using two different exciton - cavity couplings , @xmath12 .",
    "again we fix the phonon reservoir at @xmath120  k. we first note that , unlike the on - resonance spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , the relative spectral weights of the mollow triplets are also now determined by @xmath127 ( the exciton - cw laser detuning ) .",
    "the high - energy component of the mollow triplet has larger relative spectral weight if the cw - laser is detuned to the left of the exciton ( lower energies ) .",
    "conversely , the low - energy component of the triplet has larger relative spectral weight if the cw - laser is detuned to the right of the exciton ( higher energies ) .",
    "this observation is also consisent with the features of @xmath126 .",
    "an off - resonant cw - laser drive shifts the entire triplet with a corresponding shift in the location of the sidebands . a positive exciton - cw laser detuning shifts",
    "the triplet structure further away from the cavity mode but increases the spectral weight in the low energy sideband as it is pushed closer to the bare exciton resonance .",
    "a negative exciton - cw laser detuning shifts the triplet structure towards the cavity mode , and increases the spectral weight in the high energy sideband as it is pushed closer to the bare exciton resonance . also note the asymmetry in the low - energy sideband of the triplet in the top panel and the high - energy sideband in the bottom panel in both fig .",
    "[ fig : detuning](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : detuning](c ) which is explained by the difference in the interaction with the cavity owing to different effective spectral detuning between the respective sideband and the cavity mode .",
    "the asymmetry in the spectral weights is suppressed with increasing qd - cavity coupling as seen by comparing , e.g. , the relative weights in fig .  [ fig : detuning](a ) and fig .  [ fig : detuning](c ) .",
    "the enhanced exciton - cavity interaction overrides , to some extent , the effects of the spectral shift induced by the off - resonant drive .",
    "finally , we note that phonon coupling enhances the asymmetry in the relative spectral weights of the mollow triplets due to enhanced exciton coupling and reduced sideband splitting .",
    "we next study the broadening of the mollow sidebands for various excitation regimes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1 ] we show the numerically extracted fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of the mollow triplet peaks of the cavity - emitted spectrum ( @xmath114 ) for various exciton - cavity detunings and exciton - cavity couplings as a function of the square of the rabi frequency @xmath87 . clear signatures of phonon - induced eid are demonstrated by the dependence of the fwhm on the square of the rabi frequency ; for smaller exciton - cavity couplings [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1](d ) ] , this dependence is approximately linear ( for the chosen exciton - cavity detuning ) .",
    "these two plots have opposite qd - cavity detunings , and eid is marginally larger when the cavity mode is detuned to the left of the qd due to increased phonon - induced coupling between the exciton and the cavity mode .",
    "this general trend of eid increasing linearly with the square of the rabi frequency is in good agreement with recent experiments performed in semiconductor micropillars  @xcite , where @xmath128ev [ cf .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1](d ) ] .",
    "increasing the qd - cavity coupling @xmath12 also increases the fwhm of the sidebands due to stronger coupling between the qd and the cavity and enhanced emission into the cavity mode [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1](e ) ] .",
    "the dependence at higher qd - cavity couplings is nonlinear especially at low drives [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : fwhm1](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1](f ) ] ; we also find a linear increase in the fwhm as a function of the square of cw laser drive even in the absence of phonon coupling , primarily for large qd - cavity couplings .",
    "this effect can be attributed to enhanced emission into the cavity mode which is enhanced with increasing drive and broadens the triplet .",
    "we also observe a notable difference in the broadenings of the low - energy and high - energy components of the triplet in the presence of phonons .",
    "the triplet component proximal to the cavity mode shows larger broadening which increases with @xmath12 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm2 ] we study the numerically extracted fwhm of the off - resonance mollow triplet as a function of the exciton - laser detuning @xmath127 .",
    "the coupling to electron - phonon scattering is seen to introduce additional broadening of the sidebands , as expected , due to eid ; this can be seen from the differences in magnitudes between the plots in the top panel and the bottom panel .",
    "also note that the two sidebands of the triplet are broadened by different amounts which is governed primarily by the proximity of the sideband to the cavity mode . in the absence of any phonon coupling ,",
    "the mollow component which is closer to the cavity mode is broadened more due to enhanced emission into the cavity .",
    "moreover , the difference in the broadening of the high energy and the low energy components of the triplet increases with temperature .",
    "we also observe a noticeable difference in the broadening of the sidebands in the presence of phonons .",
    "we find an enhancement in the fwhm broadening when the cw laser drive is spectrally located between the cavity mode and the exciton mode .",
    "in contrast , there is substantial suppression of fwhm if the cw laser is detuned in the other direction relative to the exciton - cavity detuning .",
    "this suggest that phonons enhance the broadening process in the first scenario as it allows for an additional mechanism for enhanced emission into the cavity mode .",
    "recent experiments in semiconductor micropillars  @xcite have noted a distinct spectral narrowing of both the high energy and the low energy sideband of the mollow triplet with increasing exciton - cw laser detuning .",
    "this behaviour is quite contrary to what is obtained from a phonon - based eid model .",
    "however , a decrease in the rabi frequency was also noticed , experimentally , as a function of detuning @xcite .",
    "in addition , more recent experimental data obtained for weakly coupled qd - cavity systems find the opposite dependence on the exciton - laser detuning wherein the fwhm of the off - resonance mollow triplet is found to increase with the qd - laser detuning  @xcite",
    ". part of this anomaly can perhaps be attributed to additional detuning - dependent pure dephasing mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "further investigations and a closer collaboration between experiments and theory are likely required to understand these conflicting trends in more detail .",
    "we have presented a detailed theoretical analysis of the fluorescence spectra from a coherently driven cavity - qed system .",
    "fundamentally distinctive features of the semiconductor qd system are found because of acoustic phonon scattering in the solid state environment , which we have modelled at a microscopic level .",
    "the nonperturbative treatment of the effects of qd exciton , acoustic phonons , cavity and the cw laser field on the coherent part of the hamiltonian , was accomplished by a suitable choice of the decomposition of the system hamiltonian .",
    "a polaron transformation was adopted that retains coherent phonon coupling to all orders , while introducing a suitable ( modified ) system - bath - interaction with which to perform perturbation theory that is accurate to second order .",
    "we derived a tc me in the polaron frame to study the fluorescence spectra , and we showed that this me produces identical numerical results to a nz me solution  the latter being significantly more difficult to solve numerically .",
    "we also showed that a markovian me is perfectly valid for the cw pumping scenarios investigated in this paper , if one uses a polaron frame .",
    "we then calculated the mollow spectra as a function of exciton - cavity detuning and found that electron - phonon - scattering causes eid and significant coupling between the exciton and cavity mode , throughout the entire phonon spectral function ( easily spanning 5 mev ) . at a phonon bath temperature of @xmath107k ,",
    "the cavity resonance is found to go through a maximum at a specific detuning , when the cavity is red shifted by about 1.4  mev .",
    "the resonance spectra were found to be strongly asymmetric with respect to exciton - cavity detuning .",
    "next , we showed the role of pump excitation ( @xmath87 ) and exciton - cavity coupling rate ( @xmath12 ) , both of which are seen to have a significant impact due to phonon - induced scattering processes .",
    "both the cavity - emitted spectra ( @xmath114 ) and exciton - emitted spectra ( @xmath126 ) were calculated and these were found to have quite different spectral forms , especially near the cavity mode resonance .",
    "we subsequently investigated the spectral fwhm of the mollow triplet sidebands for various exciton - cavity detunings and exciton - cavity couplings .",
    "we analysed the mollow triplet spectra as a function of the square of the rabi frequency , and obtained unambiguous signatures of phonon - induced eid in accordance with recent experiments .",
    "we also studied the fwhm of the off - resonance mollow triplet as a function of the exciton - laser detuning .",
    "the interaction of the qd with the phonon reservoir was found to introduce pronounced features in the fluorescence spectra exemplified by emission at the cavity mode and additional spectral broadening effects . with a systematic detuning between the driving laser and the exciton , our theoretical results predict further broadening which is a prediction that is in disagreement with recent experiments in semiconductor micropillars  @xcite  which suggest a spectral narrowing of sidebands with increasing exciton - laser detuning .",
    "nevertheless , as mentioned above , recent experiments also show a spectral broadening with exciton  laser detuning  @xcite .",
    "the possible role of detuning - dependent pure dephasing also merits further study in this context , as relative magnitudes of pure dephasing and the qd radiative decay rate determine the curvature of the fwhm plot for the off - resonant fluorescence sideband as a function of qd - laser detuning .",
    "additional contributions from phonon - damped processes and higher order qd - phonon interactions may further influence the underlying physics of the laser - detuning - dependent eid .",
    "we highlight that the semiconductor - specific features highlighted above are quite distinct to the physics of atomic cavity - qed and in general the application of an atomiclike mes to these systems may drastically fail to produce the qualitative experimental features of semiconductor - based cavity - qed systems . although we have specialized our studies to an exciton - driven system , it is straightforward to also study a cavity - driven system as well , e.g. , see ref .  .",
