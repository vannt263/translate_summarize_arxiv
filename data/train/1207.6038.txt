    "wind is one of the most important renewable energy sources .",

    "+ the markovian assumption has , especially in the modeling of wind speed , several flaws . in discrete time",
    "markov chain models , waiting times in a state before making a transition to another state are geometrically distributed .",
    "therefore markov chains impose artificial assumptions on the structure of the data that , very often , are inappropriate .",
    "this leads to a great simplification of the model which is unable to reproduce correctly the statistical properties of the real wind speed process .",
    "+ semi - markov chains do not have this constraint , because the waiting time distribution functions in the states can be of any type and this allow the data to speak for themselves without any restriction .",
    "for this reason , semi - markov chains have been extensively applied to different fields @xcite .",
    "+ damico et al .",
    "@xcite was the first paper where semi - markov chains were applied in the modelling of wind speed . in that paper",
    "were proposed first and second order semi - markov models with the aim of generate synthetic wind speed data .",
    "it was shown that the semi - markov models performs better than the markov chain model in reproducing the statistical properties of wind speed data .",
    "in particular , the model recognized as being more suitable is the second order semi - markov model in state and duration .",
    "+ in this paper we show how to compute dependability measures as availability , reliability and maintainability functions for the second order semi - markov chain in state and duration .",
    "these indicators give important information on the feasibility of the investment in a wind farm by giving the possibility to quantify the uncertainty in the wind energy production . +",
    "another important aspect is related to the location of the wind farm .",
    "in fact , today , many wind farms are built offshore for different reasons : the wind speed is more powerful and constant due to the absence of obstacles and visual , environmental and acoustic impact is cut down .",
    "the maintenance cost , instead , is higher than the onshore wind farm .",
    "a good stochastic model can help the planning of preventive maintenance suggesting when is suitable to execute the maintenance operation .",
    "this is possible by analyzing what happens after a particular transition between two different states that is lasted for a certain time period .",
    "+ the results presented here are new and generalize some of the results obtained for semi - markov chain of order one ( see barbu and limnios @xcite and blasi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the model generalizes also markov chains and renewal models .",
    "+ we apply our model to a real case of energy production . for this reason , we choose a commercial wind turbine , a 10 kw aricon hawt assumed to be installed at the station of l.s.i -lastem which is situated in italy . + the paper is organized as follows .",

    "as in our previous work @xcite we used a free database of wind speed sampled in a weather station situated in italy .",
    "the station processes the speed every 10 minute in a time interval ranging from 25/10/2006 to 28/06/2011 . during the 10 minutes",
    "are performed 31 sampling which are then averaged in the time interval . in this work , we use the sampled data that represents the average of the modulus of the wind speed ( @xmath31 ) without considering a specific direction .",
    "this database is composed of about 230000 wind speed measures ranging from 0 to 16 @xmath31 .    in order to apply our semi - markov model",
    ", we discretize wind speed into 8 states ( see table [ st ] ) chosen to cover all the wind speed distribution .",
    "this choice is done by considering a trade off between accuracy of the description of the wind speed distribution and the number of parameters to be estimated .",
    "an increase in the number of states better describes the process but requires a larger dataset to get reliable estimates and it could also be not necessary for the accuracy needed in forecasting future wind speeds . on the third column of table [ st ]",
    "we report the number of times the recorded wind speed was in state @xmath32 . as it is possible to see the number of occupancies of state 7 is small compared to all other states and wind speed exceeds @xmath33 in very few cases .",

    "the power curve of a wind turbine represents how much energy it produces as a function of the wind speed . in this case , see figure [ power ] , there is a cut in speed at 2 @xmath31 , instead the wind turbine produces energy almost linearly from 3 to 10 @xmath31 , then , with increasing wind speed the energy production remains constant until the cut out speed , in which the wind turbine is stopped for structural reason .",
    "then the power curve acts as a filter for the wind speed . in the database used for our analysis",
    "the wind speed does never exceed 16 @xmath31 and it is seldom over 8 @xmath31 , this is why the discretization is performed according to table [ st ] and the wind never reached the cut out speed .    through this power curve",
    "we can know how much energy is produced as a function of the wind speed at a given time .",
