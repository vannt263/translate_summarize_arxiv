    "experimentation on gated quantum dots ( qds ) has generally used gaas as the starting material , due to its relative ease of fabrication .",
    "however , the spin properties of dots are becoming increasingly important , largely because of possible applications to quantum information and quantum computing .",
    "since the spin relaxation times in gaas are relatively short , si dots , with much longer relaxation times @xcite , are of great scientific and technological interest @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that few - electron laterally gated dots can be made using si @xcite@xcite , and single - electron qds are certainly not far away .",
    "there is one important qualitative difference in the energy level structures of si and gaas : the conduction band minimum is two - fold degenerate in the strained si used for qds as compared to the non - degenerate minimum in gaas .",
    "thus each orbital level has a fourfold degeneracy including spin .",
    "this additional multiplicity is referred to as the valley degeneracy . for applications ,",
    "this degeneracy poses challenges - it must be understood and controlled . from a pure scientific viewpoint",
    ", it provides opportunities - the breaking of the degeneracy is still poorly understood .",
    "previous experimental work has shown that in zero applied magnetic field the splitting of the degeneracy is about @xmath1 @xmath2ev in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) @xcite and that it increases when the electrons are further confined in the plane srijit_nature .",
    "surprisingly , the splitting increases linearly with applied field .",
    "theoretical understanding of these results has historically been rather poor , with theoretical values much larger than experimental ones for the zero - field splittings @xcite@xcite and theory also predicting a nonlinear field dependence @xcite .",
    "recent work indicates that consideration of surface roughness may resolve these discrepancies @xcite . in si qds , a related issue is also of importance : what is the effect of valley degeneracy on the coupling of the leads to the dots ?",
    "the spin index is usually assumed to be conserved in tunneling .",
    "is the same true of the valley index ?",
    "recent measurements of the valley splitting in a quantum point contact show a valley splitting much larger than in the 2degs , about @xmath3 mev in  quantum point contacts @xcite .",
    "a qd in a similar potential well is expected to produce a valley splitting of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the overall picture of the degeneracy is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for a single orbital level of a si qd . of particular interest",
    "is the fact that a level crossing must occur , and the rough value of the applied field at this point is @xmath4 t , given a reasonable zero - field valley splitting of @xmath5 mev , and the valley - spin slope of magnetic field for the @xmath6 state to be @xmath7 mev / t , as it is in hall bars .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the kondo effect in the context of transport through a si dot .",
    "the kondo effect was originally discovered in dilute magnetic alloys . at low temperatures ,",
    "the electron in a single impurity forms a spin singlet with electrons in the conduction band , thus causing an increasing resistance as the temperature is reduced to zero . since the first observations of the kondo effect in gaas qds , there has been considerable experimental and theoretical work done , mainly because qds provide an excellent playground where one can tune physical parameters such as the difference between energy levels in qds and the fermi level , the coupling to the leads , and the applied voltage difference between the leads .",
    "the level of scientific understanding of this purely spin kondo effect in qds is on the whole quite satisfactory .",
    "the basic phenomena are as follows . at temperature @xmath8 ,",
    "where the kondo effect appears , a zero - bias peak in the dot conductance is observed .",
    "an applied magnetic field splits the peak into two peaks separated by twice the zeeman energy @xmath9 .",
    "these linear peak energy dependencies on the applied magnetic field have been observed in gaas qds @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect only occurs when the occupation of the dot is odd .",
    "clearly , si dots will have a much richer phenomenology .",
    "there are multiple field dependencies as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , and the additional degeneracy can give rise to several kondo peaks even in zero field .",
    "furthermore , the kondo temperature is enhanced when the degeneracy is increased .",
    "we build on previous work on the orbital kondo effect .",
    "for example , an enhanced kondo effect has been observed due to extra orbital degree of freedom in carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) @xcite@xcite and in a vertical qd , with magnetic field - induced orbital degeneracy for an odd number of electrons and spin 1/2 @xcite .",
    "more complex peak structure in their differential conductance suggests entangled interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "we also note that a zero - bias peak has been observed in si mosfet structures @xcite",
    ".    our goal will be to elucidate the characteristic structures in the conductance , particularly their physical origin , and their temperature and field dependencies .",
    "once this is done , one can hope to use the kondo effect to understand some of the interesting physics of si qds , particularly the dependence of tunneling matrix elements on the valley degree of freedom .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we determine whether valley index conservation is to expected ; in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce our formalism ; in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the effect of valley index non - conservation ; in sec .",
    "v , we present our main results ; in sec .",
    "vi we summarize the implications for experiments .",
    "the basic issue at hand is the conductance of a dot with valley degeneracy , and the influence of the kondo effect on this process .",
    "the dots we have in mind are separated electrostatically from 2deg leads on either side .",
    "these 2degs have the same degeneracy structure .",
    "thus before we tackle the issue of the conductance we need the answer to a preliminary question : is the valley index conserved during the tunneling process from leads to dots ?",
    "non - conservation of the valley index will introduce additional terms in the many - body hamiltonian that describes the dots , and , as we shall see below , it changes the results for the conductance .  in this section ,",
    "we investigate the question of valley index conservation in a microscopic model of the leads and dots .",
    "we do this in the context of a single - particle problem that should be sufficient to understand the parameters of the many - body hamiltonian that will be introduced in sec .",
    "if we have a system consisting of leads and a qd in a 2deg of strained si , then both the leads and the dot will have even and odd valley states if the interfaces defining the 2deg are completely smooth .",
    "the valley state degeneracy is split by a small energy .",
    "if the valley index is conserved during tunneling , then the even valley state in the lead will only tunnel into the even valley state in the dot . on the other hand ,",
    "if the valley index is not conserved , then the even valley state in the lead will tunnel into both the even and odd valley states in the dot ; similarly for the odd valley state in the lead .",
    "we can estimate the strength of the couplings between the various states in the leads and the dot by calculating the hopping matrix elements between them .",
    "consider a system of a lead and a dot in a sige / si / sige quantum well , separated by a barrier of height @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 , there will be no tunneling between the lead and the dot and the eigenstates of the whole system can be divided into lead states @xmath12 and dot states @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the even and the odd valley states .",
    "call the hamiltonian for this case @xmath15 . when @xmath10 is lowered to a finite value",
    ", there will be some amount of tunneling of the lead wavefunction into the dot .",
    "call the hamiltonian for this case @xmath16 .",
    "this can be thought of as a perturbation problem where the @xmath17 perturbed eigenstate @xmath18 is no longer the @xmath19 unperturbed eigenstate @xmath20 but acquires components along the other unperturbed eigenstates @xmath21 .",
    "the perturbation hamiltonian is @xmath22  @xmath23 considered as a function of position is not small , but the matrix elements of @xmath24 are small .",
    "this means that in the @xmath25 order perturbation theory we can write the perturbed @xmath19 state as @xmath26where @xmath27 is the hopping or tunneling matrix term .",
    "if we further assume that the tunneling hamiltonain conserves spin and that only one orbital state need be considered on the qd , we can expand the perturbed even valley lead wavefunction ( with tunneling ) as @xmath28 @xmath29  these will be needed in later sections .    from the above equation , @xmath30 the perturbed and the unperturbed wavefunctions and",
    "the corresponding energies are calculated by using an empirical 2d tight binding model with nearest ( @xmath31 ) and next nearest neighbor interactions ( @xmath32 ) along the @xmath33 ( growth ) direction and the nearest neighbor interactions ( @xmath34 ) along the @xmath35 direction ( in the plane of the 2deg ) .",

    "the phases of the rapid oscillations of the electron wavefunctions ( along the z - direction ) are locked to the interface and in a well with smooth interfaces , the phase remains the same for a particular valley throughout @xcite .",
    "but in a miscut well , the phases are different for electrons localized at different steps even for the same valley eigenstate .",
    "the resultant valley splitting is due to interference of phase contributions from all the steps .",
    "hence the valley splitting can be very different in the lead and the dot .",
    "the same argument explains the conservation of the valley index across the barrier in the lead - dot system . in the case of a smooth interface",
    ", the @xmath62 eigenstate in the lead has same phase of the z - oscillations as the @xmath63 eigenstate in the dot , and is @xmath64 out of phase with the @xmath65 eigenstate in the dot .",
    "hence , there is a finite overlap between the @xmath66 wavefunctions , while the @xmath58 overlap cancels out due to interference .",
    "this preserves the valley index during the tunneling .    in the case of a miscut",
    "well , we can no longer strictly label the eigenstates @xmath67 or @xmath68 , but let us continue to do so just for convenience . here , because @xmath67 in the lead does not really have a single phase along @xmath33 but is composed of different phases at each step and similarly for @xmath68 in the dot , there is a fair chance that there will be a non - cancellation of the phases between the @xmath14 wavefunctions depending up the the extent of tunneling",
    ". this will give rise to a finite hopping matrix term between all the dot and lead states and the valley index @xmath69 can longer be said to be conserved .",
    "the results show that the conservation or non - conservation of the valley index depends sensitively on fine details of the dot morphology such the proximity of a step edge to the edge of the dot on atomic scales .",
    "it is not likely that good control at this level can be achieved , and thus some sample dependence must be expected .",
    "this means that it will normally be necessary to include hopping terms that do not conserve valley index into the hamiltonian in order to understand the kondo effect in realistic si qds , where the interfaces are rarely smooth .",
    "sec . ii has given us some insight into the nature of the tunneling between the leads and the dot .",
    "we now introduce a hamiltonian to describe the full many - body problem , and discuss the computational method we will use to solve it .",
    "this hamiltonian must include the single - particle energy levels of the leads and the dot , the tunneling matrix elements that connect these levels , and the coulomb interaction between electrons on the dot .",

    "this is basically the same scenario as traditional spin-@xmath221 gaas qds .",
    "[ fig : kondo_t ] shows that increase of temperature suppresses these three kondo peaks equally , demonstrating that they are scaled by the same kondo temperature .",
    "we further calculate the kondo temperature with @xmath222 .",
    "since @xmath223 , we reduce the real part of the denominator of @xmath129 to @xmath224consider @xmath225 energy state with the energy @xmath226 . as @xmath227 , eq .",
    "cal_tk can be rewritten as @xmath228again we set @xmath229 . in the region @xmath230 , because @xmath231 , @xmath232 .",
    "therefore , we neglect linear @xmath233 and the last logarithmic term @xmath234 . we obtain @xmath235thus using eom , we find @xmath236 .",
    "eto in his paper @xcite evaluates theoretically the kondo temperature in the qds with two orbitals and spin-@xmath73 as a function of @xmath216 , the energy difference between the two orbitals .",
    "he considers the case @xmath169 so the two kondo temperatures coincide .  using `` poor man s ''",
    "scaling method , he finds that within the region where @xmath237 , @xmath238 decreases as @xmath216 increases , according to a power law @xmath239where @xmath240 .",
    "the discrepancy of eq .",
    "[ eom_tk ] from eto s power law is again due to the deficiency of eom approach to find the true kondo temperature .",
    "interestingly , as @xmath216 becomes larger , the side peaks shift further away from the fermi level and we recover the conventional spin-@xmath73 kondo effect , with one kondo peak at the fermi level .",
    "this is in agreement with eto s analysis @xcite .",
    "this is now the more general case of finite field and valley splitting , but still assuming that valley index is conserved .  now",
    "the peak structure in the dos becomes more complicated . as already seen in fig .",
    "fig : kondo_delta , at @xmath241and @xmath222 , there are three peaks at @xmath242 . by applying a magnetic field , hence breaking spin degeneracy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kondo_b ] , the central peak splits into two peaks with peak positions at @xmath243 by zeeman effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kondo_b ] , the schematic diagram @xmath244 demonstrates a spin - flip transition that contributes to the peak at position @xmath245 .",
    "the side peak above the fermi level splits into three peaks with peak positions at @xmath246 which correspond to inter - valley transitions in the schematic diagrams @xmath247 , respectively , whereas the side peak below the fermi level also splits into three peaks with peak positions at @xmath248 by the same token .",
    "it is easy to see that twice the zeeman energy @xmath245 corresponds to the energy cost for spin - flip transitions , while valley splitting energy @xmath249 corresponds to that for inter - valley transitions .",
    "the positions of these eight kondo peaks have different dependencies on the magnetic field , with their slopes being expressed as various linear combinations of @xmath250 , and @xmath251 .",
    "it is worth noting that equally weighted peaks at positions @xmath252 are twice as small as the other peaks because only half the number of conduction processes contribute to the peaks .",
    "( 5,5)(1,1 )     ( 5,5)(-3,-2.5 )       this is the case where tunneling between same valley states and different valley states are equally strong .",
    "when the magnetic field is zero , there are three peaks near the fermi level which we have explained in subsection * b*. however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : valley_conser_b ] , the central peak is more pronounced than the other two side peaks .",
    "this is due to extra contribution from tunnelings between different valley states .",
    "the effect of non - conservation of valley index can be seen more clearly when we apply a magnetic field .",
    "when @xmath254 and assuming the zero - field valley splitting @xmath255 , we saw eight peaks since spin and valley states are no longer degenerate . surprisingly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : valley_conser_b ] , when the valley index is no longer conserved , we not only see the previous eight peaks as in fig .",
    "[ fig : kondo_b ] when the valley index is conserved , but also see an extra peak at the fermi level that is independent of the magnetic field , meaning it can only be suppressed by increasing the temperature .",
    "this peak comes from a logarithmic divergence in the function @xmath256 ( cf .",
    "[ fn : sma_d ] ) and is thus more pronounced as @xmath205 becomes larger .",
    "it also indicates that through cross - valley couplings @xmath257 , @xmath133 and @xmath258 form a bound state through exchanging electrons with the leads .",
    "the schematic in fig .",
    "fig : valley_conser_b demonstrates that this kind of transition through cross - valley couplings can occur without any energy cost .",
    "consequently its peak sits at the fermi level and has no dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "this is in some sense the most characteristic signature that could be sought of the valley kondo effect , since it results from a bound state of different valley states rather than different spin states .",
    "silicon quantum dots show a much richer phenomenology than gaas dots due to the additional valley degree of freedom .",
    "the initially fourfold degenerate level is split at zero applied magnetic field by interface effects and there is additional splitting at finite fields .",
    "we have computed the density of states on the dot in the large-@xmath0 limit using an equation of motion method that has been shown to give reasonable results in related problems .",
    "this function should closely mimic the non - linear conductance through the dot as a function of voltage .",
    "the nonlinear conductance near zero bias of a si qd with a single electron is sharply different from that of a gaas qd in the kondo regime :    \\1 . at @xmath37",
    "we expect three peaks near zero bias at @xmath259 where @xmath216 is the valley splitting .",
    "the central peak is the spin kondo peak while the other peaks correspond to inter - valley conduction processes .",
    "\\2 . for @xmath260",
    "the side peaks further split into three peaks , the two split - off peaks corresponding to spin - flip processes and the middle corresponding to spin conserving processes .    \\3 . for @xmath260",
    "the central peak splits into two peaks if the valley index is conserved and three if it is not conserved , the latter corresponding to a valley - kondo ground state .    \\4 .",
    "the temperature dependence can be complex , since there are two kondo temperatures in the problem .",
    "5 . the conservation or non - conservation of valley index depends quite sensitively on the precise details of the junctions and is therefore likely to be sample - dependent and difficult to control .",
    "we hope that some or all of these phenomena will be observed in future experiments .",
