    "<S> the black hole entropy is primarily due to trans - event horizon entanglement between external modes neighboring the black hole and internal degrees of freedom of the black hole .    a powerful tool for studying black hole evaporation as a unitary process is in terms of random subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of this approach is that the evaporative dynamics can be modeled by sampling a random subspace from the black hole interior , of dimensionality equaling the radiation subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> this idea was originally formulated @xcite in a model where all the in - falling matter was in a pure state @xmath0 , so @xmath1 here the initial internal ( int ) hilbert space of the black hole may be thought of as evolving under a random unitary @xmath2 followed by the ` emission ' of radiation into ( a now randomly selected ) subspace @xmath3 with the _ reduced - size _ interior labeled @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> it was argued @xcite that this dimensionality should be well approximated from the _ thermodynamic _ entropy @xmath5 of a black hole of area @xmath6 , giving a dimensionality @xmath7  where we reuse subspace labels for hilbert space dimensionalities . </S>",

    "<S> the quantum information about the in - fallen matter leaves in a narrow ` pulse ' at the radiation emission rate .    </S>",
    "<S> our key point of departure from previous work is motivated by the well - accepted result from many - body quantum theory that the entanglement of across a boundary will generically scale as the boundary s area @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to conjecture that a black hole s thermodynamic entropy might be primarily due to entropy of entanglement between modes external to , but in the neighborhood of the event horizon and modes of the black hole s interior . </S>",
    "<S> such a conjecture has indeed been made @xcite ; it holds naturally for some models of black holes @xcite and even resolves some difficulties associated with computing entropy at the microscopic level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that this conjecture leads to a radically different picture of information flow from black holes .    as with ref .   </S>",
    "<S> we tag the information about the matter that collapsed to form the black hole by entanglement with some distant reference ( ref ) subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that there is _ no _ so - called `` bleaching '' mechanism which can strip away all or part of the information about the in - fallen matter as it passes the event horizon , then the initial quantum state of the black hole interior ( int ) and its surroundings has the unique form @xcite @xmath15 up to overall int - local and ext - local unitaries . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 means we pad any unused dimensions of the interior space by zero vectors @xcite and @xmath17 is the reduced density matrix for the external ( ext ) neighborhood modes . </S>",

    "<S> note that @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> again using the distant reference to tag the information ( see appendix  [ decoupling ] for details ) , it is easy to see that for all but the final @xmath22 qubits radiated , the information about the in - fallen matter is encoded in the combined space of external neighborhood modes and black hole interior with fidelity at least @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for all but the initial @xmath22 qubits radiated , this information is encoded in the combined radiation and external neighborhood modes with fidelity at least @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at all times this information is encoded with unit fidelity within the joint radiation and interior subspaces .    </S>",
    "<S> in other words , between the initial and final @xmath22 qubits radiated , the information about the in - fallen matter is effectively deleted from each subsystem individually @xcite , instead being encoded in any two of the three of subsystems . during this time </S>",
    "<S> , the information about the in - fallen matter is to an excellent approximation encoded within the perfect correlations of a quantum one - time pad @xcite consisting of the three subsystems : the radiation , the external neighborhood modes , and the black hole interior . </S>",
    "<S> this description applies to the entire evaporation period except for the short encoding and decoding periods ( assuming small @xmath23 above ) . </S>",
    "<S> a heuristic picture showing a smooth flow of information is given in appendix  [ heuristic ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider what happens if additional matter is dumped into the black hole after its creation . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  , we model this process via cascaded random unitaries on the black hole interior  </S>",
    "<S> one unitary before each radiated qubit . within the pure state model of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ haydenpreskill ] ) , it was argued @xcite that after half of the initial qubits had radiated away , any information about matter subsequently falling into the black hole would be `` reflected '' immediately at roughly the radiation emission rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a subtle flaw to this argument is due to the omission of the fact that a black hole s entropy is non - extensive , typically scaling as the square of the black hole s </S>",
    "<S> mass @xmath24 : for every @xmath25 qubits dumped into a black hole , the entropy increases by @xmath26 . likewise , the number of unentangled qubits within the black hole will increase by @xmath27 . therefore , within the cascaded unitary pure - state model , </S>",
    "<S> the reflection described in ref .   would not begin immediately , but only after a large delay in time of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding the delay , the very different _ behaviors _ of the black hole in the first and second halves of its life endows it with a kind of quasistatic `` hair '' associated with its history since creation .    </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the one - time - pad description of evaporation [ for black holes described by the entropy - as - entanglement conjecture of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) ] paints a very different picture . instead of the reflection of information found in the pure - state model , here </S>",
    "<S> , any additional qubits thrown into the black hole will immediately begin to be encoded into the tripartite correlation structure ( assuming negligible @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , just as in the uncascaded case , the decoding into the radiation subspace of _ all _ the information about all the in - fallen matter will only occur at the very end of the evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> the non - extensive increase in black hole entropy is taken up as entanglement with external neighborhood modes so no further delays occur . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , entanglement - based black holes really are `` hairless '' : their _ behavior _ does not qualitatively change in time .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen , in the pure - state model of a black hole the information about the in - fallen matter leaves in a narrow pulse after half the qubits have evaporated , whereas for the entangled - state model , this information appears in the out - going radiation only at the end of the evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> one way to reconcile these two models is if the pure - state model were run for twice as many qubits , but stopped just after the information about the in - fallen matter had escaped . </S>",
    "<S> if we accepted the model of a black hole as highly entangled across its event horizon we could justify this reconciliation as a rough approximation : in particular , instead of fixing a boundary at the event horizon we could fix it somewhat further out , say at @xmath29 . in this case , the dimensionality enclosed would be roughly the square of that of the black hole interior space itself by including the contribution from the external neighborhood modes ; this would therefore yield roughly twice as many qubits as the black hole itself holds . </S>",
    "<S> the trans - boundary entanglement at @xmath29 would be approximately static over the entire course of evaporation so it could be factored out as non - dynamical , thus leaving an approximately pure - state description . </S>",
    "<S> finally , once the original number of qubits had evaporated away ( now half the total for our modified pure - state model ) the black hole interior would be exhausted of hilbert space and evaporation would cease . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that despite the incompatibility between the two models , a pure - state analysis , if properly set up , can capture important features of information retrieval from the entangled - state model .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the _ no - hiding theorem _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was used to prove that hawking s prediction of featureless radiation implied that the information about the in - fallen matter could not be in the radiation field , but must reside in the remainder of hilbert space  then presumed to be the black hole interior . </S>",
    "<S> that work presented a strong form of the black hole information paradox pitting the predictions of general relativity against those of quantum mechanics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we have shown that trans - event horizon entanglement provides a way out , since now the `` remainder of hilbert space '' comprises both the black hole interior and external neighborhood modes . </S>",
    "<S> because the evaporating black hole actually involves three subsystems , the information may be encoded within them as pure correlations via a quantum one - time pad @xcite : the information is in principle retrievable from any two of the three subsystems , yet inaccessible from any single subsystem alone . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneous encoding of information externally ( in the combined radiation and external neighborhood modes ) and ` internally ' ( if one _ stretches _ the horizon to envelope the bulk of the external neighborhood modes in addition to the black hole interior ) is reminiscent of susskind s principle of black hole complementarity @xcite . yet , the overlap between the interior and exterior in this picture eliminates any need for a temporary or unobservable violation of the no - cloning theorem . within the one - time pad encoding trans - event horizon entanglement </S>",
    "<S> provides a mechanism whereby hawking s calculations may accurately describe the behavior of out - going radiation from a black hole until very late in its evaporation ; it does not necessarily solve the paradox , but it delays for as long as possible the clash between two of our most cherished and fundamental theories of nature .    0.1truein </S>",
