    "estimates based on simulations of the evolution of close binaries arrive at rates up to @xmath12  (  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that the estimated merger rates from observations and model computations may be reconciled .",
    "`` theoretical '' estimates for the birth and merger rates of ns binaries are usually derived from the models which combine the parameterized computations of the evolution of stars with prescriptions for the variation in the binary parameters due to the evolution of its components . by combining the model with distribution functions for the zero - age primary masses , mass - ratios , orbital periods and eccentricities , a complete picture of the population of binary stars",
    "is obtained .",
    "an example of the evolutionary scenario for a binary , which leads to the formation of two ns is given in fig .",
    "[ figscen ] .    although the concept of the formation of ns binaries is relatively well understood ( @xcite , @xcite , see however @xcite ) , the models imply some badly understood processes .",
    "the most crucial among these are the nonconservative mass exchange ( especially the common envelope phase ) and the supernova process .",

    "the outcome of the ce phase is either the coalescence of stars or the expulsion of the envelope .",
    "models of the ce phase are still in an embryonic state .",
    "therefore , a _ common envelope parameter _  is usually introduced .",
    "the most common definition of  is the ratio of the binding energy of the ce to the orbital energy of the binary (  @xcite ) .",
    "models of the populations of close binary white dwarfs , low- and high - mass binary millisecond pulsars ( see below ) and some other objects may be fit to observations if @xmath15 though , formally , @xmath16   means that sources other than orbital energy must be invoked in the expulsion of the ce , in fact , in such a parametric approach , this simply suggests that energy deposited into a ce has to be comparable to the orbital energy .",
    "roughly , the ratio of semi - major axes of the orbit of a binary after and prior to the ce stage is @xmath17 , while the timescale for gravitational in - spiral is @xmath18 .",
    "this makes all merger rate estimates highly sensitive to .",
    "estimates given below were found by portegies zwart & yungelson @xcite for = 2 .",
    "a velocity kick may be imparted to the nascent ns . while the mechanism and distribution of _ natal kicks _ are still a matter of debate , there is firm observational evidence for their occurrence @xcite .",
    "natal kicks may unbind binaries , which otherwise might have remain bound and , _ vice versa _ ,",
    "conserve the binaries which without the kick would have been dissociated .",
    "an analysis of the role of kicks may be found  in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we used the distribution for isotropic kick velocities @xmath19 which has the functional form suggested in @xcite with numerical parameters from @xcite : @xmath20 implementation of eq.([eqkick ] ) provides the best fit to the observed population of single pulsars close to the sun ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "peculiarity of this distribution is the combination of a peak at low velocity and of a high - velocity tail .",
    "selection effects in the population of single radio pulsars , however , cause the exact shape of the kick velocity distribution to be ill constrained both at low and high velocities .",
    "alternatives as  a maxwellian distribution with mean of 250 to 500  can be found in the recent literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the results of computations without kicks , with a kick taken isotropically from eq .",
    "[ eqkick ] , and with a kick from a maxwellian distribution with @xmath21 are presented in table  2 .",
    "another parameters , like the initial mass - ratio distribution or initial orbital separation , affect the results by a factor of @xmath22 .      a model which aims to predict a reliable birth and merger rate for ns binaries should provide also the characteristics of related types of binaries and hmbp . for the hmbp ,",
    "the most useful observational parameters for comparison with the model are the orbital period @xmath6 and eccentricity @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "the best fit between the observations of hmbp and the computations is obtained for = 2 and the distribution of kick velocities given by eq .",

    "figure [ pe ] shows probability distributions of the orbital parameters of the ns binaries with @xmath24day at an age of the population of @xmath25yr . as demonstrated in @xcite , natal kicks `` smear ''  distribution . in the absence of kicks only psr b1913 + 16 appears in the region of the  diagram with high probability .",
    "figure [ pe ] suggests that the average age of the population of observed hmbp is several hundred myr .",
    "therefore it suggests that recycled pulsars are born with low magnetic fields .",
    "table 3 compares the predictions of the preferred model from @xcite to the observations of ns binaries and related objects .",
    "the model is normalized to the current star formation rate in the galactic disc of @xmath26  @xcite ; @xmath27 and 100% binarity are assumed .",
    "the adopted lower mass limit for the formation of a ns is 8  for an isolated star and 11.4  for stars in close binaries .",
    "the model satisfactorily reproduces the occurrence rates of supernovae descending from massive stars , numbers of be / x - ray and massive x - ray binaries ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the model does not contradict observational estimates of the birthrate of single pulsars or the fraction of single recycled pulsars among all pulsars ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to notice that our computations do not violate the `` bailes criterion '' @xcite , which limits the fraction of hmbp among the population of radio pulsars .",
    "the birthrate of ns binaries derived from computations is considerably higher than the observational one , which involves highly uncertain estimates of the incompleteness of the sample of observed objects @xcite and their lifetimes @xcite .",
    "_ observational _ estimates are also likely to underestimate the actual birthrate , since a considerable fraction of old nss in binaries may avoid recycling and after the death of the young pulsar never show up as pulsars .",
    "the results of computations agree with observations for the stages preceding formation of ns binaries , give a reasonable estimate of their birthrate and reproduces their distribution in the  diagram .",
    "we therefore expect that computations also correctly predict the merger rate of ns binaries : @xmath28  in the galaxy .",
    "this estimate exceeds the most optimistic `` observational '' values by a factor of a few .",
    "however , about 10% to 20% of all ns binaries merge only after the recycled pulsar has died in 0.5  1gyr ( fig .  [ age ] ) .",
    "another @xmath29   merge within @xmath30 myr , while the young pulsar is still visible . and we note that possibly only a fraction of old ns are recycled and show up in hmbp . this suggests a revision of the `` observational '' merger rate upward .",

    "+   +    [ theobs ]    in @xcite it is demonstrated that a higher average kick velocity in the supernova decreases the merger rate . in the most unfavored case of a maxwellian kick combined with a mass ratio distribution peaked to 0 and small  the merger rate may drop by an order of magnitude .",
    "the lifetime for a ns binary before it merges is typically below 1 to 2 gyr ( fig .",
    "[ age ] ) .",
    "the merger rate is therefore dominated by the star formation rate in the last few gyr . in massive ( @xmath49 ) spiral ( like the milky way ) and",
    "irregular galaxies the star formation rate in the far past was probably significantly higher than at present @xcite . however , past bursts of star formation contribute only little to the current merger rate of ns binaries .",
    "the same point has to be made with respect to elliptical galaxies , as most of their stars were formed in a short @xmath50gyr ) burst ; the overwhelming majority of ns binary mergers happened long ago .",
    "if we have two 10 gyr old , equal mass galaxies with the same average star formation rate but in one case all stars are formed in a single initial burst and in the other the star formation was constant , the merger rate of ns binaries in the first galaxy is @xmath30 to 15% of that in the latter .    extrapolating our merger rates for ns binaries to the local universe , using the blue luminosity of the universe @xcite and assuming @xmath51",
    ", we obtain for the detection rate by the first generation of gwr detectors sensitive to distances of @xmath52mpc @xcite only @xmath53 in 200 yr ! for advanced detectors ( sensitive to a distance of 250 mpc ) the detection rate increases to @xmath54 .",
    "the merger rate for black hole + neutron star binaries ( bh+ns ) is expected to be about 20 times smaller than for ns binaries @xcite and the rate of bh+bh mergers is virtually zero .",
    "the reason behind this is twofold .",
    "first , massive stars suffer heavy mass loss especially when they become wolf - rayet stars .",
    "e.g. , evolutionary computations for solar composition stars with _ observationally inferred mass loss rates _",
    "@xcite suggest that stars with an initial mass larger than @xmath55have mass about 10  prior to supernova .",
    "the stellar wind is expected to be isotropic and to carry away the specific angular momentum of the donor .",
    "therefore mass loss in a stellar wind increases the orbital separation .",
    "secondly , bh are not expected to receive sizable kicks which may , if `` properly '' directed , decrease the binary separation .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for gravitational waves detectors is given by @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57  are the masses of coalescing objects and @xmath58  is the distance to them . for @xmath59",
    "suggested by observed bh candidates , one would expect that a bh+ns merger is detectable to about 1.5 to 2.5 times as far as ns+ns merger .",
    "hence , the rates of detections of ns+ns and bh+ns mergers may be comparable .",
    "also in the dense cores of globular clusters ( gc ) mergers between ns may occur .",
    "the fraction of primordial binaries which evolve to the stage where gwr drives the components into coalescence is , however , small .",
    "the majority of them are ejected from the cluster or dissociated by the encounter with another star",
    ". some of the ejected binaries still result in a ns binary and finally merge .",
    "single ns in the cores of high - density gc may find another star and be captured by it either in a two- or three body encounter .",
    "if two ns are able to form a binary in such a way this may increase the ns binary merger rate for post - collapse clusters considerably .",
    "a reliable estimate for the occurrence rate of such mergers is not trivial as the evolution of the binaries and the stars are coupled in a complex fashion . for solving this problem direct n - body simulations with a realistic number of stars are required , for which the hardware simply does not exist at present .",
    "recently , however , portegies  zwart  @xcite , @xcite developed a simplified model for simulating the interaction between evolving stars and binaries while taking dynamical encounters into account .",
    "the microscopic dynamics of close encounters between single stars and binaries are solved using semi - analytic and 3-body techniques , while the macroscopic evolution of the stellar system is assumed to be unaffected by its slowly changing stellar population .",
    "the results of these computations concerning the merging of ns binaries may be summarized as follows : in the model for a core - collapsed cluster , the fraction of merging primordial binaries is @xmath60 .",
    "the fraction of ns binaries among these is @xmath61 the time interval between core collapse and hubble time is @xmath54gyr .",
    "if one takes a globular star cluster with @xmath62 stars of which 10% are in the region with a high density and 25% primordial binaries , one obtains a rate for ns binary mergers of @xmath63 .    of the binaries which are formed by tidal capture , which occurs once every @xmath64 years , the merger rate for ns binaries is only @xmath65 ( almost all tidally formed binaries coalesce , but only a fraction of 0.004 contains two ns ) .    for a total of @xmath66  gc in our galaxy merger rate for ns binaries becomes @xmath67 .",
    "the detection rate for the early gwr detectors is therefore only @xmath68 years ( depending on the fraction of dense star clusters ) .",
    "thus , the rate of ns mergers in the field under any circumstances is much higher than the rate of mergers in gc .",
    "`` theoretical '' and `` observational '' merger rates of ns binaries produce similar results if the ejection of ce is highly efficient and nascent neutron stars receive , on average , velocity kicks of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "the rate of ns mergers is @xmath70 for a galaxy with constant astration rate of 4  ( and @xmath71 and 100% binarity ) .",
    "this rate is uncertain by a factor of a few mainly due to uncertainties in the kicks velocity distribution and the efficiency of energy deposition into the ce .      extrapolating the galactic merger rate of ns binaries , we arrive at a detection rate of once every @xmath73yr for the first generation gwr detectors ( which are expected to be sensitive up to @xmath55mpc ) .",
    "bh+ns mergers may be registered at the rate comparable with binary ns mergers .",
