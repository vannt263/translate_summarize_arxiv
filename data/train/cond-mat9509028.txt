    "the damping of quasiparticles via electron collisions is expected to produce a @xmath2 variation of the resistivity in a standard fermi liquid described by a spherical fermi surface . in ordinary metals",
    "this contribution is so weak that it is hardly detectable@xcite .",
    "however , recent discoveries of a dominant @xmath2 resistivity contribution in several anisotropic metals such as organic superconductors and layered cuprate and sulfide alloys provide an interesting challenge from the theoretical point of view since the observed magnitudes of such resistivities are very large .",
    "examples@xcite of the unconventional resistivities are shown in figure [ rho ] .    in view of the conventional wisdom regarding the expected weakness of the electron - electron scattering contribution to the resistivity",
    ", alternate interpretations of the tis@xmath0 data were proposed on the basis of unusual phonon scattering . however",
    ", decisive evidence for the fermi liquid origin of the scattering was discovered by julien@xcite in the infrared spectra of tis@xmath0 .",
    "these spectra show a remarkable frequency and temperature variation in accordance with the luttinger damping for a fermi sphere that was derived to all orders of perturbation theory for the coulomb interaction@xcite . the huge value of the resistivity of tis@xmath3is on par with the data for the nd@xmath4ce@xmath5cuo@xmath1 cuprate which also has a layered structure .",
    "it is also comparable to the resistivity of many organic metals such as that of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath6 shown in figure [ rho ] .",
    "the organics have quasi - two dimensional fermi surfaces with a high degree of anisotropy .",
    "by contrast , the much smaller resistivity of lead shown in figure [ rho ] provides an example of the scale set by strong electron - phonon contributions .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to calculate the quasiparticle damping for a two dimensional electron system due to spin fluctuation scattering arising from the constant on - site coulomb interaction @xmath7 in a hubbard model .",
    "we first compute the standard normal state damping and then focus on the influence of an isotropic superconducting energy gap on the frequency and temperature variation of the self energy .",
    "the superconducting energy gap is expected to reduce the damping in a characteristic way that depends on the symmetry of the order parameter as well as the source of the damping .",
    "the spin susceptibility , which enters in the calculation of the damping , is first analyzed for the normal electrons and then generalized to include the bcs coherence factors in the superconducting state .",
    "our goal is to use the computed damping in a calculation of the nmr relaxation rate , with particular interest in the superconducting state response .",
    "the relaxation rate is obtained from a momentum average of the spin susceptibility that includes the calculated fl self - energy corrections .",
    "vertex corrections to the susceptibility are also calculated and shown to be small in the regime considered in the nmr studies .",
    "we apply our results to experimental nmr measurements on the organic superconductors .",
    "these provide insight into the structure caused by the damping as well as the symmetry of the superconducting state .",
    "the modification of the hebel ",
    "slichter ( hs ) peak is found to be particularly instructive in the case of the anomalies seen in the organics , although the general phenomenon is relevant to the high temperature cuprate superconductors as well .",
    "luttinger@xcite originally derived the classic three dimensional fermi liquid property of a quasiparticle damping arising from electron collisions that vanishes at the fermi energy at zero temperature and then follows a quadratic variation in temperature @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 ( measured from the fermi energy ) .",
    "et al._@xcite and others@xcite calculated the quasiparticle damping and resistivity for a cylindrical fermi surface , which introduces logarithmic corrections to the damping at low @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we first calculate the two dimensional fermi liquid damping in the normal state by performing a momentum average over the exact spin susceptibility for a non - interacting electron gas .",
    "we then proceed to compute the susceptibility as well as the self energy in the superconducting state , and probe the influence of the calculated damping on the nmr response which involves a momentum  averaged spin susceptibility .",
    "the original motivation for our present work was the mysterious absence of a hebel ",
    "slichter peak in the nmr response of high temperature cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "the resistivity of the optimally doped cuprates above the superconducting transition is typically linear in temperature in contrast to the fermi liquid behavior considered here .",
    "a similar physical origin of electron - electron scattering in both cases may be plausible , because alloying changes the linear @xmath8 to a @xmath2 variation in many of the cuprates@xcite .",
    "historically the hs peak in the nmr relaxation is considered to be one of the key successes of the bcs theory since it occurs in various ordinary metals@xcite .",
    "the organic superconductors yield cases where the hs peak appears , ( mdt - ttf)@xmath0aui@xmath0 @xcite , and also examples like ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1@xcite where the peak is suppressed .",
    "the nmr relaxation in the bedt@xcite compounds resembles the cuprate anomalies , such as a @xmath10 behavior at low @xmath11 in the superconducting state .",
    "hence the present analysis is directed at the organics which often have the quadratic @xmath8 variation of the resistivity that is compatible with our fermi liquid analysis .",
    "the absence of the coherence peak has attracted considerable previous theoretical interest .",
    "hasegawa and fukuyama@xcite derived the nmr response for s  wave and other symmetries of the energy gap appropriate to organic superconductors .",
    "they obtained weaker , but nonetheless finite , hs peak structure for both singlet and triplet pairing states in which the order parameter exhibits line nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "their calculation did not include the quasiparticle damping .",
    "other groups have examined the effects of a strong enhancement of the quasiparticle damping near @xmath12 , which broadens the bcs singularity in the superconducting density of states .",
    "some theory groups have invoked a variety of phenomenological models for the damping as a function of temperature@xcite .",
    "typically , these authors use a power law variation for the @xmath8 dependence of the damping ( with a @xmath10 behavior as one example ) and neglect the frequency variation .",
    "phenomenological models have been proposed to fit the observed spin dynamics in the cuprates@xcite .",
    "the `` marginal '' fermi liquid response hypothesis has been used to generate a damping model which has also been applied to the nmr measurements@xcite .",
    "tight binding energy band models have also been investigated in the context of spin dynamics of cuprates by bulut and scalapino@xcite and by levin s group@xcite . the nmr relaxation for s and d  wave energy gaps has been calculated@xcite using phenomenological models for the damping .",
    "the quasiparticle damping from spin fluctuations in the superconducting state has also been independently computed within a tight binding model@xcite .",
    "our analysis of the influence of the damping on the nmr spectra in the superconducting state is based on a standard approximation for the momentum  averaged spin susceptibility .",
    "this allows analytic expressions to be derived and used in the calculation of the damping , thus reducing the number of numerical integrations .",
    "however , this limits the present approach to reasonably isotropic fermi surfaces , and can not account for features such as nesting .",
    "phonon damping has furnished yet another more traditional explanation for the suppressed hs peak , provided that a large electron - phonon coupling combined with a small coulomb pseudopotential are assumed@xcite .",
    "phonon contributions to the resistivity may be one distinguishing feature of the mechanism responsible for the nmr anomalies , and the organic resistivity data in figure [ rho ] provide a challenge in this regard since the @xmath2 variation is difficult to reconcile with phonon scattering .",
    "considering the wide array of theoretical proposals for the nmr anomalies , it is important to make distinctions based on specific features such as the response over a wide range of temperature , and consistency of parameters with other experimental clues .",
    "the @xmath2 damping which characterizes the organic superconductors considered here is one example .",
    "the temperature dependence of the nmr relaxation rate at low @xmath8 is also a primary constraint on theory since it is particularly sensitive to the symmetry of the order parameter , while the hs peak structure is sensitive to the damping as well as the gap symmetry .",
    "thus our calculations provide insight into the role of damping in the organic superconductors and the ncco cuprate which also exhibits a @xmath2 resistivity above the superconducting transition .",
    "a theoretical basis for the anomalous linear t variation of the resistivity that is an ubiquitous feature in all of the optimally doped high temperature superconductors discovered so far is the nested fermi liquid theory ( nfl)@xcite . the corresponding calculations for the nfl damping in the presence of an isotropic energy gap by rieck _ et al._@xcite reveal a very dramatic suppression of the nested spin susceptibility in the superconducting state which strongly reduces available scattering states for electron collisions . hence the nfl damping is greatly reduced at frequencies lower than thrice the energy gap @xmath13 .",
    "the latter damping structure is compatible with microwave surface resistance data on the ybco superconductor in the vicinity of @xmath12 where the damping drops by four orders of magnitude within a few degrees of @xmath12 .",
    "there are also numerous earlier calculations that found a sharp suppression of the damping in the case of phenomenological models that are extensions of the `` marginal '' fermi liquid hypothesis@xcite for the susceptibility .",
    "these are discussed in reference@xcite .",
    "recently won and maki@xcite have shown that a nesting model yields nmr relaxation without a hs peak if indeed the scattering processes near the nesting vector form the dominant contribution to the susceptibility .",
    "we develop the formalism for the susceptibility and self energy in section ii , and present the calculated fermi liquid damping results .",

    "we have calculated the quasiparticle damping @xmath25 arising from electron - electron collisions in a two dimensional fermi liquid .",
    "we have presented results for the temperature and frequency variation of @xmath25 in the normal and the superconducting state with an isotropic energy gap .",
    "the damping is found to be quadratic in temperature and frequency above the superconducting transition , consistent with the @xmath2 resistivity of the organic superconductors and the nd@xmath4ce@xmath5cuo@xmath1 cuprate .",
    "the computed damping follows an unusual frequency variation in the superconducting state for frequencies @xmath133 .",
    "the reduction in available scattering states due to the opening of an isotropic energy gap causes the quasiparticle damping to drop at temperatures below the superconducting transition , as seen in our results . on the other hand an energy gap of d - wave symmetry has nodes and thus ensures the availability of scattering states even at @xmath29",
    "this would produce a quasiparticle damping that drops less rapidly as @xmath8 decreases below @xmath12 .",
    "we have also explored the influence of the calculated fl damping on the nmr relaxation rate .",
    "we find that the damping acts to reduce the magnitude of the hebel - slichter peak below @xmath12 , but does not eliminate it .",
    "our results are compared to experimental data on three organic superconductors . in the case of ( mdt - ttf)@xmath0aui@xmath0",
    ", our results fit the data and reproduce the weak hs peak seen in the experiment . in the case of ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 ,",
    "the data show no hs peak and deviate from our fl results .",
    "we find , however , that if the damping is made anomalously large , our results resemble the data on ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath1 , though a small hs peak is still present in the calculations .",
    "since the hs peak is sensitive to the bcs coherence factors , the gap symmetry and the quasiparticle damping , the analogous `` coherence peak '' in the microwave conductivity should provide a further test of our analysis .",
    "applications of the fl damping to microwave conductivity and surface resistance measurements on the ncco cuprate@xcite reveal that these probes are also sensitive to the self  energy structure@xcite .    the nmr data on the bedt organic superconductors exhibit a very rapid decrease below @xmath12 that is similar to the behavior seen in the high temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "these cases appear to require additional mechanisms to explain the lack of a hebel - slichter peak as well as the curvature of the nmr relaxation below @xmath12 .",
    "our microscopic analysis yields a relaxation curve that remains considerably higher than the bedt data in the superconducting state even if the coulomb coupling is artificially increased to unrealistic values .",
    "the influence of the symmetry of the gap on the relaxation rate may be seen from the behavior of the density of states . for an s - wave gap ,",
    "the superconducting density of states is zero below @xmath13 and has a square root singularity at @xmath13 .",
    "the density of states for a d  wave gap is linear at low energies and has only a logarithmic singularity at @xmath13 .",
    "while the hebel slichter peak is greatly reduced as a result of replacing a square root singularity by a logarithmic one , the relaxation rate in the d  wave case falls off more slowly than the s  wave case as @xmath8 decreases below @xmath12 . at low temperatures , the d  wave relaxation rate varies as @xmath10 , and",
    "the bedt data provide evidence for the latter symmetry .",
    "we note here that in the case of the nfl damping calculated for a nested fermi surface by rieck _",
    "et al._@xcite , the quasiparticle damping drops to zero at frequencies @xmath134 more rapidly than the fl damping discussed here .",
    "also the nesting generates an enhanced peak in the susceptibility at the nesting vector whose suppression by an isotropic energy gap is more pronounced than the case of the averaged susceptibility that dominates the fermi liquid response in the present work .",
    "the extension of the present analysis to incorporate a d - wave energy gap is in progress .",
    "future studies of a model fermi surface that includes nesting features are warranted in view of the remaining anomalies in the nmr spectra of the bedt organic compound as well as the cuprate superconductors .",
