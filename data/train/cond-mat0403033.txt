    "this kind of problem was already observed in the scaling of the correlation function of the @xmath35 dimensional wv model  @xcite .",

    "simple extrapolation methods provide accurate estimates of the exponent @xmath0 from saturation widths @xmath82 in small lattices .",
    "thus , the above problems lead to the conclusion that the local width scaling in the growth regime is not suitable for calculating an exponent @xmath0 which reliably indicates the class of the growth process .",
    "this is particularly important in experiments where the local roughness ( or the correlation function ) scaling in the growth regime is analyzed , because the slope of a linear fit of an arbitrarily chosen region of the @xmath77 plot may lead to a value of @xmath0 which incorrectly identifies the universality class .",
    "another problem has been previously found  @xcite in the scaling of the local width , for which there are corrections due to effects of finite spatial resolution , which would be relevant only for systems with @xmath83 .",

    "one possibility is the analysis of the slopes of the @xmath84 plots , whose minima seem to indicate the asymptotic value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is indeed achieved in the plots of figs . 4a and 4b , where we show @xmath85 ( the local curvature of the @xmath77 plot ) as a function of @xmath79 for the rsos and the family models , respectively . for both models ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath86 decreases in time , which indicates an increasingly better fit of the @xmath77 data to a straight line , and the corresponding @xmath81 converges to the asymptotic @xmath0 .",
    "it is important to stress that this procedure is usually not suitable for the analysis of experimental data due to the difficulties to calculate second derivatives with reasonable accuracy .",
    "thus , its interest is restricted to theoretical work . moreover , our results for the dt and wv models , to be presented in sec . 5 ,",
    "will show that this procedure does not work properly for models with significant crossover effects .",
    "the scenario is not very different in @xmath46 .",

    "is obtained , but also in a restricted range of @xmath20 .",
    "in order to estimate the exponent @xmath1 , our first step is to calculate a characteristic length @xmath88 which is proportional to the correlation length at a given time @xmath7 .",

    "consequently , our data also suggests that the dt model is in the ew class in @xmath46 .    a comparison of the cases @xmath43 and @xmath46 is essential at this point .",
    "first , in @xmath43 the power law scaling is justified by the fact that the values of @xmath135 obtained with different values of @xmath91 were nearly the same . however , no extrapolation of @xmath135 leads to an asymptotic exponent consistent with the known classes of interface growth .",
    "thus , the best that can be said from our data is that there is a crossover from the fourth order linear behavior ( @xmath130 ) to a different class . on the other hand , in @xmath46 , different effective exponents were obtained with fixed @xmath7 and different @xmath91 or @xmath112 , but only the logarithmic scaling hypothesis led to the same asymptotic behavior for different @xmath112 .",
    "simple extrapolations are possible and give @xmath132 , thus indicating the asymptotic ew class .",
    "another important point on the usefulness of the method to calculate @xmath1 is that , if we want to determine whether the system presents logarithmic scaling or not , we can simply test power - law and logarithmic behaviors and analyze the convergence ( or divergence ) of the estimates of @xmath1 as time increases , for different choices of a single parameter ( @xmath112 for logarithmic behavior , @xmath91 for power - law behavior ) . the fact that there is not an optimal value for @xmath91 or @xmath112",
    "give us increasing confidence in the extrapolated value , since for the correct choice of the dynamic scaling relation the asymptotic @xmath1 must not depend on these parameters .",
    "we studied the scaling of the local interface width @xmath74 of several limited mobility growth models , focusing on the methods to estimate the scaling exponents . the methods to calculate the roughness exponent from the scaling of @xmath74 at small length scales do not give reliable estimates since the intervals of window sizes in which that scaling is valid are small . on the other hand , the method proposed to calculate the dynamical exponent provides effective exponents in agreement with the expected universality classes for models with weak scaling corrections and reflects the expected crossover behavior for models such as dt and wv in @xmath34 dimensions .",
    "the difficulties to measure the roughness exponents may be partially overcome in theoretical studies by improving the analysis of the @xmath136 plots , but it only works for models with very weak scaling corrections .",
    "this analysis leads to the conclusion that the calculation of the exponent @xmath1 from experimentally measured local widths is more adequate than the calculation of @xmath0 to infer the universality class of the growth process .",
    "we believe that the method based on the local interface width would be equivalent to the method based on the height - height correlation function . for instance , our estimate of ( effective ) @xmath0 for the @xmath35-dimensional dt model is consistent with the estimate obtained from the scaling of the height - height correlation function by das sarma and punyindu  @xcite , which was recognized as a transient regime .",
    "we agree with the observation of siegert  @xcite that the exponents @xmath137 and @xmath13 obtained from the scaling of the height - height correlation function ( or the local width ) are not so reliable as those obtained from other methods , such as the structure factor .",
    "thus , our proposal is to calculate the dynamical exponent @xmath1 whenever it is necessary to deal with local roughness data .",
    "our results also contribute to the debate on the universality classes of the dt and of the wv models in @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "for both models , there is evidence of an asymptotic ew behavior . in the case of the dt model ,",
    "the possibility of vlds behavior is excluded by the evolution of the effective dynamical exponents . for the wv model",
    ", our result is in contradiction with the universality class suggested by das sarma and co - workers  @xcite , the unstable(mounded morphology ) class , but agrees with previous results of siegert  @xcite and krug et al  @xcite .",
    "it motivates further numerical studies on these lines , although the computational cost will significantly increase , mainly due to the rapid increase of fluctuations in the @xmath74 and in the @xmath9 data as the deposition time increases .",
    "we note that , if the asymptotic universality class of the wv model in @xmath46 is in fact the unstable ( mounded morphology ) one suggested by das sarma and co - workers , it is not particularly meaningful to talk about the usual exponents @xmath0 , @xmath13 and @xmath1 anymore , since the surface would not be statistically scale invariant",
    ". possibly an explanation for the controversy could come from the observation of the morphologies of the growth fronts in the simulations  @xcite using noise reduction techniques . while the dt surface gets smoother when the noise reduction factor varies from 1 ( no noise reduction ) to 5",

    "<S> , we studied the family , the restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) , the das sarma - tamborenea ( dt ) and the wolf - villain ( wv ) models in one- and two dimensional substrates , in order to compare different methods to obtain those exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling at small length scales do not give reliable estimates of @xmath0 , suggesting that the usual methods to estimate that exponent from experimental data may provide misleading conclusions concerning the universality classes of the growth processes . on the other hand , we propose a more efficient method to calculate the dynamic exponent @xmath1 , based on the scaling of characteristic correlation lengths , which gives estimates in good agreement with the expected universality classes and indicates expected crossover behavior . our results also provide evidence of edwards - wilkinson asymptotic behavior for the dt and the wv models in two - dimensional substrates .    </S>",
