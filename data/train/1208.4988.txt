    "the concept of entanglement , a typically quantum mechanical property , is a natural consequence of the superposition principle for composite systems .",
    "it was discussed by schrdinger who immediately realized its ( at the time ) seemingly `` unphysical '' consequences @xcite . nowadays",
    "the growing interest in the subject is related to quantum information theory and potential technological applications @xcite .",
    "thus a lot of effort has been put both in the quantification of entanglement and in studying the consequences of deleterious environmental effects on this property @xcite .",
    "it is well known today , both theoretically and experimentally , that in general such effects tend to destroy quantum properties ; in the case of systems with one degree of freedom this happens only asymptotically @xcite .",
    "the studies concerning the degradation of quantum effects are vast in the literature , specially those related to continuous variables systems subjected to noisy channels , see @xcite .",
    "some recent works devote their attention to the robustness of gaussian and non - gaussian states under dissipative channels @xcite .",
    "it was recently realized that in bipartite systems that entanglement may disappear suddenly , phenomenon called therefore `` entanglement sudden death '' ( esd ) or finite - time disentanglement @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is strongly related to geometrical properties of the set of mixed quantum states @xcite , but from a physical point of view , the issue is still far from being closed .    in the present work we study more specifically the entanglement properties of two mode gaussian states under a nonunitary evolution . in ref .",
    "leocarol1 , leocarol2 , adesso1 the entropy growth of single - mode gaussian and non - gaussian states coupled to a reservoir has been presented in analytical form .",
    "we show that in the two - mode case , single - mode squeezing plays an important role in entanglement dynamics , even for fully symmetric channels ( phenomenon that appears also in the case of qu - bits @xcite ) . for the specific case of a zero temperature reservoir and symmetric states ( where initial single mode squeezing of both modes is @xmath0 ) we are able",
    "wo show that esd will always occur if @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the two mode squeezing .",
    "we also show that there exists an upper limit for the degree of mixedness of a state so that it can exhibit entanglement .",
    "this result may turn out useful for experimental realizations of two - mode entangled gaussian states .",
    "finally , for symmetric and pure states evolving in a reservoir at zero temperature , we analytically present the time of esd .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ gaussiangeneral ] we present some well known properties concerning gaussian states ; in the next section we briefly review the analytical dynamics of two - mode gaussian states ; in section [ results ] we present our results . finally , some conclusions are drawn .",
    "a two - mode gaussian state with vanishing averages @xmath4 , @xmath5 , can always be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the single mode squeezing operator , @xmath8 is the two - mode squeezing operator and @xmath9 is the two - mode thermal state .",
    "more explicitly we have : @xmath10 \\exp \\left [ \\frac{z_2}{2}(a_2^{\\dagger 2 } - a_2 ^ 2 ) \\right ] , \\\\ s_2 ( r ) & = & \\exp \\left [ r ( a_1^\\dagger a_2^\\dagger - a_1 a_2 ) \\right ] , \\\\ \\mathbf{\\sigma}(\\nu_1 ,",
    "\\nu_2 ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\nu_1 + 1 } \\frac{1}{\\nu_2 + 1 } \\sum_n \\sum_m \\left ( \\frac{\\nu_1}{\\nu_1 + 1 } \\right)^n \\left ( \\frac{\\nu_2}{\\nu_2 + 1 } \\right)^m\\left| n \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle n \\right| \\otimes \\left| m \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle m \\right| ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the single - mode squeezing parameter of the mode @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath14th mode , @xmath15 is the two - mode squeezing and @xmath16 is the `` mixedness '' of the @xmath14th mode ( by `` mixedness '' we mean the initial number of thermal photons of the state ) , related of the thermal two - mode state @xmath17 .",
    "we assume @xmath18 in this work , since the entanglement properties are independent of them , and in our equations of motion the second momenta evolution decouple form the first momenta .",
    "we also choose , without loss of generality in this case , the squeezing parameters @xmath11 and @xmath15 to be real .",
    "this state is entirely described by the parameters given above . however , in order to handle entanglement properties , it is most convenient to write these parameters in terms of the corresponding covariance matrix ( cm ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes the quantum expectation value @xmath25 of an observable @xmath26 .",
    "the cm can also be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a @xmath29 matrix related to the mode @xmath12 , and @xmath30 is a @xmath29 matrix that gives the correlations ( both quantum and classical ) between the modes .",
    "for later use , we define some invariants of the covariance matrix as @xcite : @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these quantities are invariants under local unitary operations and @xmath32 . next we give the explicit connection between the parameters of the gaussian state and the matrix elements of the covariance matrix : @xmath33 \\\\ \\nu_1 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\det v_1 - \\det v_2 \\right)+   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sqrt{1-x^2 } \\left ( \\det v_1 + \\det v_2 \\right ) - \\frac{1}{2 } , \\\\",
    "\\nu_2 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\det v_2 - \\det v_1 \\right)+   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sqrt{1-x^2 } \\left ( \\det v_1 + \\det v_2 \\right ) - \\frac{1}{2 } , \\\\ r & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\mathrm{arctanh}\\left [ x \\right ] ,   \\label{rt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath34 once the evolution of the covariance matrix is obtained , the evolution of the parameters of the state can be inferred .",
    "since we are working with gaussian states , there are _ necessary and sufficient _ criterion to determine if the state is entangled @xcite .",
    "simon @xcite has shown that for any two - mode gaussian state , if the following inequality is observed @xmath35 the state is separable .",
    "for the purposes of this work , simon s criterion is enough to study the entanglement dynamics .",
    "the degradation of the quantum information content of gaussian states is a subject of interest , both for the technological and/or experimental applications as well as for fundamental quantum mechanics in what concerns the classical limit .",
    "the usual approach to non - unitary dynamics is by means of master equations , which has found several successful applications in other areas of physics .",
    "our master equation reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a superoperator given by : @xmath38 in the equation above , @xmath39 is the dissipation constant of the reservoir related to the mode @xmath12 , @xmath40 is related to the temperature of the thermal bath of the mode @xmath12 , and @xmath41 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the respective mode .",
    "the equation models a linear coupling between the state ( the two - mode gaussian state in our case ) with a thermal bath of quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "the evolution of each term of the covariance matrix , evolving under the dynamics described above , is given by : @xmath42 in the equations above , @xmath43 or @xmath44 ( mode 1 or mode 2 ) and @xmath45 .",
    "the parameters are such that @xmath46 is the initial _ single mode squeezing _ , @xmath39 is the dissipation constant , @xmath47 is related to the _ initial mixedness _ and @xmath48 is the reservoir temperature , where all the quantities refer to the @xmath14th mode , as denoted by the suscript @xmath12 .",
    "also , we have that @xmath1 is the initial _ two - mode squeezing_.",
    "in order to get a clear picture and to gain physical insight into the rich and multifaceted aspects of the non - unitary dynamics of general two - mode gaussian states , we consider firstly the simplest case , _",
    "i.e. _ the two - mode squeezed vacuum in dissipative channel .",
    "let us consider the case of a two - mode vacuum state without single - mode squeezing ( _ i.e. _ @xmath49 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ figura1 ] , for symmetric and asymmetric channels , _ with temperatures @xmath50 and @xmath51 different from zero _ , there will always be a finite time when entanglement vanishes .",
    "this can be understood using a geometrical picture of entanglement decay @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this case , the long - time state is a separable mixed state , well within the set of separable states .",
    "thus , if an initial state is entangled , it necessarily crosses the border of separable states in finite time . for zero - temperature baths ,",
    "i.e. if @xmath52 , even if one uses different dissipation constants @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the entanglement only disappears asymptotically .",
    "next we introduce single mode squeezing , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath55 and/or @xmath56 . we note in figure [ figura2 ] that , even for the zero temperature case , one observes entanglement sudden death ( esd ) .",
    "we note that there is a dynamical entropy increase of the squeezed mode , caused by the reservoir , which acts in such a way that , for a relatively short time interval , this mode s entropy grows and then decays to the vacuum .",
    "we have observed that this dynamical entropy growth @xcite causes the entanglement disappearance in finite time .    since single - mode squeezing turns out to play a significant role on esd . in figure [ figura7 ]",
    "we show simon s criterion evolution for states with compression in only one of the modes , for reservoirs at null temperature .",
    "the vertical axis corresponds to the initial parameter @xmath57 and the plot shows , for each instant of time , whether the evolved state is entangled ( shaded area ) or not ( blank area ) .",
    "for instance , if the initial state has @xmath58 , simon s criterion will change from negative to positive in finite time ; if one have @xmath59 , the entanglement will vanish asymptotically .",
    "we will show an analytical relation between single - mode squeezing and esd hereafter .    in the following we want to discuss the instant of time in which the state becomes separable , or when occurs esd , in the case of _ zero temperature _ and _ symmetrical states _",
    "( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62=@xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , for @xmath5 ) . in this case",
    "the elements of the covariance matrix , which do not vanish , depend on @xmath66 in this case simon @xmath67 can be factorized as @xmath68 .",
    "since the first two factors are clearly positive , we can see that @xmath67 is negative if @xmath69 . if this inequality is satisfied at the initial time , @xmath70 .",
    "now , multiplying by @xmath71 we get @xmath72 .",
    "thus , if the state is initially entangled , the evolved state is also entangled for any finite time . since simon @xmath67 vanishes asymptotically @xmath73 , we see that either the entanglement decay is asymptotic , or the initial state is already separable . a two - mode squeezed vacuum , @xmath74 ,",
    "is always entangled ; hence , it separates asymptotically .",
    "now we study @xmath75 for states containing single - mode squeezing , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath76 . here",
    "one can find for @xmath75 : @xmath77where we consider @xmath61 , and @xmath78 . in terms of the new variables @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the disentanglement time @xmath81is much easier to analyze .",
    "this equation has a valid solution when the right - hand side varies between 0 and 1 , that is , when @xmath82 satisfies the inequality @xmath83 .",
    "going back to the original variables we conclude that the initial state separates at a finite time if @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", one can see clearly that the effect of single - mode squeezing is crucial to determine when the entangle will vanish .      recently @xcite it has been shown that in the case of single mode gaussian states , there is an upper limit for the degree of global purity ( represented by @xmath47 ) of the state above which no quantum properties are visible .",
    "we now show that an analogous result holds for two mode gaussian systems also . following the steps in ref .",
    "@xcite we can show that the initial state is entangled if the following inequality is satisfied : @xmath85 in figure [ figura9 ] we show the entanglement in the initial state as measured by @xmath67 , with @xmath86 .",
    "notice that there is an upper limit on the initial state impurity above which the state becomes separable .",
    "in this paper we review some aspects of two - mode gaussian states , showing both the evolution of the state parameters ( that entirely characterize the state ) under nonunitary evolution and how entanglement of the state , characterized by the simon criterion , depends on the initial state parameters .",
    "we show that , even in completely symmetrical reservoirs and _ zero temperature _ , the entanglement can vanish in finite time , depending on the single - mode squeezing of the state .",
    "we give a condition for esd relating single mode squeezing and two mode squeezing , that is @xmath87 .",
    "we analytically present the time when occurs esd for symmetrical states , evolving in a reservoir with zero temperature .",
    "we also show that entanglement can be suppressed  by the initial mixedness of the modes , @xmath88 : the initial two mode squeezing has an upper limit as a function @xmath89 , and for values above this limit the state is separable",
    ". this can be helpful for experimental procedures , since any state will have some minimal impurity .",
