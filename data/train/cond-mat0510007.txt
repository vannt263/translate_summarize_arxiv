    "in diffusive normal metal / superconductor ( dn / s ) junctions , the dn acquires induced superconductivity , i.e. cooper pairs penetrate into the dn .",
    "this proximity effect has been studied since the bcs theory was established .",
    "the proximity induced meissner demagnetization in dn / s junctions was measured experimentally by oda and nagano@xcite and mota et al.@xcite .",
    "it has @xmath1 dependence in the dirty limit .",
    "the quasiclassical green s function theory was used earlier to study the meissner effect in proximity structures .",
    "the quasiclassical green s function theory was developed by eilenberger  @xcite and was generalized by eliashberg  @xcite , larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite in order to study the nonequilibrium state .",
    "this theory was applied by zaikin@xcite and kieselmann@xcite to studing the meissner effect in dn / s junctions .",
    "narikiyo and fukuyama  @xcite calculated the meissner screening length in a semi - infinite system containing an anderson impurity . higashitani and",
    "nagai studied the meissner effect in the clean limit  @xcite .",
    "belzig et al .",
    "@xcite have considered more realistic systems by assuming a perfectly transparent n / s interface . up to now the boundary conditions derived by kupriyanov and lukichev ( kl ) @xcite",
    "were widely used to study proximity effect in dn / s structures .",
    "a more general boundary conditions was derived by nazarov @xcite based on the keldysh - nambu green s function formalism @xcite within the framework of the landauer - bttiker scattering formalism .",
    "the merit of this boundary condition is that the btk theory@xcite is reproduced in the ballistic limit while in the diffusive limit with a low transmissivity of the interface , the kl boundary condition is reproduced .",
    "although almost all previous papers on meissner effect in mesoscopic ns junctions are either based on the kl boundary conditions or on the btk model , in the actual junctions , the transparency of the junction is not always small and the impurity scattering in the dn can not be neglected .",
    "tanaka et al.@xcite and yokoyama et al.@xcite calculated tunneling conductance by using the nazarov s boundary condition .    it is well known in @xmath0-wave superconductors that the midgap andreev resonant states ( mars ) are formed at the interface of @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the mars crucially influence various physical quantities @xcite .",
    "one of the authors ( y.t . )",
    "recently generalized the boundary condition of the keldysh - nambu green s function formalism to unconventional superconductor junctions  @xcite .",
    "it is revealed that in dn/@xmath0-wave superconductor junctions the proximity effect and the mars strongly compete with each other  @xcite , while they coexist in dn / triplet superconductor junctions .",
    "the newly obtained boundary conditions expressed in the keldysh - nambu green s function are useful for the calculation of various physical quantities .",
    "the timely problem is to study theoretically the meissner effect in dn / @xmath0-wave s junctions using the new boundary conditions @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we calculate the susceptibility of the dn layer in dn/ @xmath0-wave s junctions for various junction parameters such as the height of the insulating barrier at the interface and the angle between the normal to the interface and the crystal axis of a @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will provide the derivation of the expression for the susceptibility of the dn . in section 3 ,",
    "the results of calculation are presented for various types of junction . in section 4 , the summary of the obtained results is given .",
    "in the present paper we set @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the model and the formalism .",
    "we consider a junction consisting of vacuum ( vac ) and superconducting reservoirs connected by a quasi - one - dimensional diffusive conductor ( dn ) with a length @xmath3 much larger than the mean free path .",
    "we assume that the interface between the dn conductor and the s electrode at @xmath4 has a resistance @xmath5 , the dn / vac interface at @xmath6 is specular , and we apply the generalized boundary conditions by tanaka @xcite to treat the interface between dn and s. a weak external magnetic field @xmath7 is applied in @xmath8-direction ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the vector potential can be chosen to have only the @xmath9 component which depends on @xmath10 .",
    "we describe the insulating barrier between dn and s by using the @xmath11-function ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) , which provides the transparency of the junction @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath15 is the injection angle of a quasiparticle measured from the interface normal to the junction and @xmath16 is fermi velocity . in the following ,",
    "we solve the usadel equations @xcite with using the standard @xmath17-parameterization .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is a measure of the proximity effect in dn and obey the following equation @xmath19=0 ,   \\label{usa1}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the diffusion constant and the matsubara frequency , respectively .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath22 at the dn / s interface is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . the interface resistance @xmath5 is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "here @xmath25 is sharvin resistance @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fermi wave number and @xmath28 is the constriction area .",
    "the current distribution is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the vector potential , the density of states at the fermi energy and the temperature of the system respectively .",
    "the maxwell equation reads @xmath33 the boundary conditions for @xmath30 are given by @xmath34 where we have neglected the penetration of magnetic fields into the superconductor by assuming a small penetration depth in s.    finally we obtain the expression of the susceptibility , @xmath35 the @xmath0-wave pair potentials in directional space are given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the magnitude of pair potential at a given temperature @xmath32 and @xmath38 denotes the angle between the normal to the interface and the crystal axis of a @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "in the following , we focus on the magnitude of the diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath39 induced by the proximity effect . figs .",
    "2 and 3 show the susceptibility for @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively where @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the temperature dependencies of @xmath44 are not much different . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath39 for @xmath40 is much stronger suppressed than that for @xmath41 . at the same time , we find that the magnitude of @xmath39 decreases with increasing @xmath38 .",
    "we note in the case of @xmath46 that the susceptibility completely vanishes , ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is because the proximity effect is absent in diffusive metals due to angular averaging@xcite .",
    "the absence of the proximity effect is a significant feature specific for junctions containing unconventional superconductors .",
    "we also plot the @xmath38 dependencies of the susceptibility at @xmath48 and @xmath49 in fig .",
    "4 . for all cases , @xmath39 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 . at @xmath48 ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath39 for @xmath40 rapidly decreases with the increase of @xmath38 .",
    "the results imply that the mars suppresses the proximity effect in low transparent junctions and low temperatures .",
    "in the present paper , we have calculated the induced meissner effect by the proximity effect in dn region of dn/@xmath0-wave superconductor junctions .",
    "we have solved the usadel equation under a general boundary condition @xcite in which the formation of the mars is fully taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath39 decreases with the increase of @xmath38 up to @xmath50 . at @xmath46 , where all quasiparticles feel mars ,",
    "the @xmath39 becomes zero .",
    "it might be interesting to check experimentally such an anomalous proximity effect in dn .",
    "another future problem is a similar calculation of the induced meissner effect with a @xmath51-wave triplet superconductor instead of a @xmath0-wave one , since dramatic new phenomena are recently predicted in dn/ triplet junctions @xcite .",
