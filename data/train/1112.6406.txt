    "in the recent years , deep near - infrared imaging surveys have begun to yield a significant number of candidate galaxies at very high redshifts .",
    "the wide - field surveys from the ground have produced a handful of bright candidates at @xmath6 ( e.g. , ouchi et al .",
    "2009 ; hickey et al . 2010 ; castellano et al . 2010 ; capak et al . 2011 ; hsieh et al . 2012 ; hathi et al .",
    "2012 ) , while the pencil - beam survey by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) within the historical advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) hubble ultra deep field ( hereafter acs - hudf ; beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) and its two parallel fields ( hudf09 ; pi .",
    "illingworth ) have probed the fainter populations at @xmath68 ( oesch et al .",
    "2010 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2010 , b10 ; bunker et al .",
    "2010 ; mclure et al .",
    "2010 , m10 ; yan et al .",
    "2010 , y10 ; finkelstein et al . 2010 ) and possibly out to @xmath7 ( yan et al . 2010",
    "; wyithe et al . 2011 ; bouwens et al .",
    "the wfc3 early release science program ( ers , pi .",
    "oconnell ; windhorst et al .",
    "2011 ) has played an important role in connecting the `` wide '' and the `` deep '' ends of the exploration , allowing construction of @xmath68 samples at intermediate brightness levels ( wilkins et al .",
    "2011 ; b11 ; lorenzoni et al .",
    "2011 , l11 ) . meanwhile , the hubble infrared pure parallel imaging extragalactic survey ( hippies ; yan et al .",
    "2011 ) and the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey ( trenti et al .",
    "2011a ) have been exploring the bright end of the population through a large number of random , discrete wfc3 pointings obtained during the _ hst _ parallel orbits .",
    "surveys in foreground cluster fields utilizing gravitational lensing magnification have also resulted in a handful of promising candidates at @xmath89 ( e.g. , richard et al . 2006 ; bradley et al . 2008 , 2012 ; laporte et al . 2011 ; hall et al . 2012 ) , which complement the surveys in blank - sky fields .",
    "the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; pis : faber & ferguson ; see grogin et al . 2011 and koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) employs a two - tiered , `` wide and deep '' strategy , which makes it uniquely positioned in bridging the significant gaps among existing surveys .",
    "in particular , its `` deep '' component will cover @xmath9  arcmin@xmath1 in two fields upon completion , and its data will be ideally suited for studying galaxies at very high redshifts . in this paper , we report our preliminary results from the deep observations in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) southern field , where we use the nearly complete data set to study the galaxy population at @xmath0 .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters throughout : @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 .",
    "the quoted magnitudes are all in the ab system .",
    "as detailed in grogin et al . ( 2011 ) , the candels / deep region in the goods - s field is located in its middle stripe where we have the deepest goods _ spitzer _ coverage , which also includes the acs - hudf .",
    "the data used in this study include 100% of the observations in f105w ( hereafter @xmath14 ) and 83% of the observations in f125w ( @xmath15 ) and f160w ( @xmath16 ) scheduled for this field .",
    "the typical exposure times per sky position are 8090 , 7450 , and 7770 seconds in @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . our present analysis is confined to the region where the effective integration times are at least 4000 seconds in all three wfc3 bands , which is 62.9  arcmin@xmath1 in size .",
    "for the reason described below , we further exclude the region covered by the acs - hudf data , and the final effective area in our current study is 50.1  arcmin@xmath1 .",
    "the products of the candels data reduction ( koekemoer et al . 2011 ) include the science mosaics and the associated `` root mean square '' ( rms ) maps . these rms maps account for correlations between pixels that are introduced during the data reduction procedures ( see e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "such correlations tend to reduce the measured pixel - to - pixel background noise in the _ hst _ images , and can lead photometry programs to underestimate the actual photometric uncertainties .",
    "we avoid this problem by computing uncertainties using the normalized rms maps , summing their values in quadrature over the measurement apertures , and including an additional term for poisson noise from the source flux ( generally negligible for very faint dropout galaxies ) .",
    "the values of the candels rms maps have been validated both by comparison with autocorrelation measurements of the image noise , and by analysis of the dispersion of measurements in apertures randomly distributed within empty regions of the images .",
    "our final mosaics have a pixel scale of @xmath17 , and are tied to the same astrometric frame as the acs data in goods .",
    "the goods acs data are used in our study to confirm the optical non - detections of the candidates ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "these data have been reprocessed to make mosaics at the same @xmath17 pixel scale for candels . on average , the 5-@xmath18 sensitivities ( as measured from the rms maps ) within a @xmath19-radius aperture in acs f435w , f606w , f775w , f850lp ( hereafter @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and wfc3 @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are 28.04 , 28.25 , 27.65 , 27.48 , 28.15 , 28.05 , and 27.82  mag , respectively .",
    "the hudf region presents a complexity in our analysis .",
    "both the hudf09 wfc3 ir data and the acs - hudf data are much deeper than their counterparts that cover the rest ( and much wider ) area of interest .",
    "if we were to use these deeper data in our candidate selection , it would be very difficult to uniformly carry out the simulations that are necessary for the follow - up analysis ( see  3.4 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we therefore exclude the acs - hudf region from this current work .",
    "in addition to the goods acs data , we also have new acs data in f814w ( hereafter @xmath24 ) that candels took in coordinated parallel mode to the wfc3 ir observations ( see grogin et al .",
    "these new acs data suffer severely from the degraded charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) of the aged ccds , however , and the empirical correction of anderson & bedin ( 2010 ) were applied first before they were processed by the candels reduction pipeline .",
    "the photometry in wfc3 and acs was done together by running the sextractor software ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in dual - image mode .",
    "we used the sum of the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 mosaics , each weighted by the inverse square of their rms maps , as the detection image .",
    "a 3-pixel fwhm , 7@xmath257 gaussian filter was used to convolve the detection image , the threshold was set to 0.8-@xmath18 , and at least 4 connected pixels above this threshold are required .",
    "sextractor provides a number of methods to measure flux , among which mag_aper , mag_iso and mag_auto are commonly used in dropout selections .",
    "mag_aper magnitudes are calculated within a circular aperture of fixed size .",
    "as most high - redshift galaxies are compact , using these magnitudes can still be appropriate when the circular aperture size is carefully chosen so that it maximizes the s / n and minimizes the loss of light for the majority of the sources of interest . while it has the advantage of being robust in extracting very faint sources , mag_aper has the disadvantage that real galaxies , which have different light profiles , have different fractions of light lost for a fixed aperture .",
    "mag_iso magnitudes are calculated within isophotal areas , which are set by the detection threshold and hence trace the different shapes of real galaxies . for this reason , mag_iso usually can be tuned to maximize s / n for galaxies of different morphologies .",
    "however , it does not capture the total light of a galaxy .",
    "mag_auto magnitudes are calculated using adaptive elliptical apertures based on the first moment of the light distributions of galaxies ( kron 1980 ) , and are the most suitable for deriving total magnitudes if an appropriate `` kron factor '' is chosen . however , using a large kron factor to capture total light usually means that the apertures are set too large for very faint sources such that their s / n are not optimized .",
    "bearing both the advantages and the caveats in mind , we adopted the mag_auto magnitudes ( using the default [ kron factor , minimum radius]@xmath26[2.5 , 3.5 ] ) in this work .",
    "dropout selection uses hard boundaries in color space ( see  3.1 ) . as a result ,",
    "photometric errors cause objects be scattered in and out of the selection area : an object whose intrinsic colors meet the selection threshold could be missed because of the errors in its measured colors , and vice versa . while this effect can be taken into account statistically by applying the correction for the `` effective volume '' ( see  3.4 ) , the candidate samples constructed using different photometry could differ significantly on an object - by - object basis . to demonstrate this effect",
    ", we also constructed a separate sample using mag_iso magnitudes , which is presented in the appendix and is compared to the mag_auto sample . in both cases , we only kept the sources that have s / n  @xmath27  5.0 in at least one band among @xmath15 and @xmath16 , measured within the mag_auto or the mag_iso apertures .",
    "we also make extensive use of the goods _ spitzer _ irac data ( dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) , which also have the same sky projection as other data here , and have a pixel scale of @xmath28 .",
    "we mostly concentrate on the @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xmath31 m channels ( hereafter [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] ) in this study .",
    "we used a version of the goods photometry where the detection was done with a `` mexhat '' filter to optimize de - blending .",
    "we adopted mag_aper within a @xmath32-radius ( i.e. , 2.5 pixels ) aperture , and obtained the `` total magnitudes '' by applying the corrections as determined in the goods program where the aperture of this size has been used ( e.g. , yan et al . 2005 ) , which are @xmath33 and @xmath34  mag for [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] , respectively .",
    "in this section , we describe our samples of candidate galaxies at @xmath0 selected as @xmath14-dropouts and the possible biases in our selections .",
    "our first color criterion for @xmath14-dropout selection is @xmath35  mag .",
    "this is the same as that employed by b10 and y10 , and is significantly larger than that of @xmath36  mag used in b11 and oesch et al .",
    "( 2012 ) where those authors have opted to included more galaxies at lower redshifts ( starting at @xmath37 ) in their @xmath14-dropout selection .",
    "our larger color decrement threshold is sensitive to lyman - break at @xmath38 .",
    "when the objects have s / n  @xmath39 in @xmath14 , we use their 2  @xmath18 upper limits and only keep those that have @xmath40  mag as calculated using these conservative upper limits .",
    "our second criterion is that a @xmath14-dropout should have s / n  @xmath41 in all four bands of goods acs images ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is to implement the invisibility requirement in these `` veto '' images , which is a necessary condition ( though not sufficient ) that the detected @xmath43 color decrements in our candidates are not features in galaxies at low redshifts ( for example , the 4000 break at @xmath44 2 ) that could mimic the lyman - break , because such low - redshift galaxies could have detectable fluxes in these bands . setting the threshold to a quantitative value of s / n  @xmath41 is somewhat arbitrary , however .",
    "based on experience , adopting s / n  @xmath41 for invisibility usually is a good compromise between minimizing the incompleteness and keeping the size of the initial candidate sample manageable for the later visual inspection ( see below ) . to exclude as much as possible the contamination from the red galaxy population at low redshifts ,",
    "we impose a third criterion of @xmath45  mag .",
    "this also largely limits our selection window to @xmath46 , and could be biased against genuine galaxies at @xmath0 that have unusually large dust reddening or extraordinarily old stellar populations should they exist .",
    "figure 1 shows our selection in the @xmath47 space .",
    "each of these criteria introduces incompleteness , for which we will correct statistically ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "the initial candidates have been visually inspected to ensure that they are legitimate sources in the ir images and that there is no reason to suspect that their photometry might be unreliable .",
    "examples of problems that are not accounted for in the statistical noise model ( and thus require visual inspection ) include diffraction spikes , poorly rejected cosmic rays , inappropriate deblending , and bad background subtraction due to nearby neighbors .",
    "while such issues are rare in the entire photometric catalog , they can be selected when looking for objects with unusual colors , such as dropouts .",
    "visual inspection step is necessary to reduce the rate of contamination , and is commonly adopted in dropout selections by various groups .",
    "it is somewhat subjective ; different inspectors might not agree on a particular candidate , and even the same inspector might not be able to completely reproduce at different time his / her results on a large set of samples .",
    "nevertheless , visual inspection is irreplaceable to get a reliable sample .",
    "ideally , the simulation discussed in  3.4 should also include this step when deriving the incompleteness correction .",
    "however , it is impractical to examine the 90,000 artificial galaxies inserted during the simulation .",
    "nevertheless , we do not think that many of these would have been inappropriately rejected by visual inspectors , because the inserted galaxies do not resemble the artifacts or those with skewed photometry that we typically reject .",
    "relative to the 90,000 inserted objects , we suspect only a handful would have these problems .",
    "thus we do not think that the failure to visually inspect the artificial galaxies has a significant effect on our computation of the incompleteness and the effective volume .    in our visual inspection process",
    ", the initial candidates were first examined by one of us ( hy ) to get rid of the most obvious contaminators ( @xmath48 objects ) , such as image defects close to the field edges , diffraction spikes of bright stars , bad pixels , residuals of ir persistence , etc .",
    "the remaining candidates ( @xmath49 ) were passed to six persons for independent inspections using a three - grade system of  firm acceptance \" ,  firm rejection \" and  border - line case \" . to be included in the final samples ,",
    "a candidate should be firmly accepted by at least three inspectors , and should not be firmly rejected by more than one inspector . as described below , this approach has allowed us to study the possible systematic biases caused by visual inspections .",
    "we note that the contemporaneous candels @xmath24 images have also been used in our current selection process .",
    "however , the flux upper limit estimate is subtle in these cte - restored images when a source is undetected in single exposures , and a rigorous treatment to be adopted by our team is still yet to be finalized . to avoid possible changes to our sample in the future because of this reason , at this stage we refrain from directly using the @xmath24 upper limits or s / n values in the quantitative veto process , and just use the @xmath24 images in the visual inspection step ( nevertheless , we do confirm that our current final candidates indeed formally satisfy the invisibility requirement in @xmath24 ; see  3.3 ) .",
    "in addition to the usual examination of the mosaics , we have taken extra steps for assurance . in the ir , we have followed yan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and examined the final candidates in their single - epoch wfc3 science images and the associated `` data - quality '' flags to confirm that they are not due to instrument defects . in the optical ,",
    "we have constructed the `` @xmath50 '' sum image of the four goods acs @xmath42 bands for our candidates . based on szalay et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the @xmath50 sum of these images optimally combines the signals from different bands and extend to a fainter limit that achieved by individual bands .",
    "the @xmath50 images of our final candidates all have @xmath51 , which is consistent with being drawn from a random sky distribution ( szalay et al .",
    "1999 ) and thus further confirms their non - detections in the acs .",
    "the final candidates in our sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "their images are displayed in figure 2 .      to investigate the possible contamination of our sample by noise spikes due to background fluctuations",
    ", we carried out the so - called negative image test ( e.g. , dickinson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the image mosaics described in  2 , which all have zero mean background by construction ( see koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) , were multiplied by @xmath52 to make any positive pixels to negative and vise versa .",
    "sextractor was run in dual - image mode again on these negative images in the same way as in  2 , using the weighted sum of the the negative @xmath15 and @xmath16 images as the detection image . after applying the same selection criteria for our @xmath14-dropouts as in  3.1 , only three `` objects '' survived , all of which have @xmath53  mag , and all",
    "only show up in the negative @xmath15 image .",
    "their morphologies have odd shapes and are typical of noise spikes , and would be easily rejected during the visual inspection step .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the contamination due to noise spikes is negligible in this work .      our stringent requirements of non - detection in the acs ( individual bands and @xmath50 sum ) as well as @xmath45  mag are effective in removing contaminations from red galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in addition , the irac data for the isolated candidates support that they are unlikely contaminators of this kind , because such objects , if very weak in optical , should have very red colors at 14  @xmath31 m such that @xmath54\\gtrsim 2 $ ]  mag ( e.g. , yan et al .",
    "our candidates that have irac flux measurements are all at @xmath54\\lesssim 1.3 $ ]  mag .",
    "another possible contaminant could be cool galactic dwarf stars .",
    "our criterion of @xmath55  mag is large enough to exclude most such contaminations .",
    "in addition , the number density of m / l / t - dwarfs in a high galactic latitude region such as the goods - s is likely negligible ( ryan et al . 2011 ) .",
    "furthermore , our detailed morphological analysis in the accompanying paper ( r. ryan et al .",
    "2012 , apj submitted ) shows that our brightest candidates are more consistent with extended light profiles than point - like .    using the 4  ms _ chandra _ catalog of xue et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we find no x - ray counterparts to our candidates within @xmath56 .",
    "there is thus no evidence that these objects are agn rather than normal galaxies .",
    "another paper based on the similar data set as ours was submitted by an independent group right after ours ( oesch et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter o12 ) , and here we compare our sample to theirs based on the latest update available to us ( p. oesch , private communication , 2012 ) .    in the overlapping region ,",
    "the wfc3 ir data are essentially the same in both studies .",
    "however , o12 s reduction of the candels wfc3 data is different from ours , and hence the end products of the science mosaics and the associated rms maps are different .",
    "the photometry is also different .",
    "o12 s detection image is a @xmath50 image derived from the @xmath15 and @xmath16 images , whereas ours is the weighted sum of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "while they used mag_auto as we also did , they adopted a smaller aperture ( 1.2 kron ) to compute colors .",
    "in addition , they stacked all the available acs data in this region .",
    "we refrained from combining the late acs data that suffer from the cte problem with the earlier goods v2.0 @xmath42 acs data , and for the same reason we only used the @xmath24 data in the visual inspection step ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "finally , o12 adopted rather generous color criteria of @xmath36  mag and @xmath57  mag , while we used @xmath55  mag and @xmath45  mag .",
    "all these factors contribute to the differences between the o12 sample and ours .",
    "it is interesting and instructive to compare the inclusion of the o12 candidates in our samples , and vice versa .",
    "based on the photometry reported in o12 , nine of their 14 @xmath14-dropouts in the same field would be expected to enter our samples . our sample , as shown in table 1 ,",
    "include five of them . among the four candidates not in our sample , three of them , candy-2209246371 , 2432246169 and 2277945141 have @xmath58 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 and",
    "are not included in our mag_auto catalog , and the other one , candy-2272447364 , has @xmath59 based on our photometry .",
    "we note that one of our brightest candidates , auto_100 , is not in the o12 sample .",
    "o12 believes that this object has a 2.4 @xmath18 detection in @xmath24 , derived in the conventional way using sextractor . while our selection does not use the formal s / n estimates in @xmath24 ( see  3.2 ) , we have also derived such estimates and confirmed after - the - fact that all our final candidates formally have s / n@xmath41 . this particular object has s / n@xmath41 in both the mag_auto and the mag_iso apertures ( see also appendix ) .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the differences in photometry as outlined in  3.3.2 .",
    "to conclude , the level of overlap and discrepancy between these two samples is all well expected given the level of differences in their constructions .",
    "we further demonstrate this in the appendix .      a given choice of lyman - break color criteria , applied to a particular data set , leads to a probability distribution as a function of redshift and magnitude , @xmath60 for selecting galaxies as dropout candidates .",
    "this probability distribution , in turn , corresponds to an effective volume ( @xmath61 ) for lyman - break selection as a function of magnitude ( steidel et al .",
    "we have carried out extensive simulations to derive @xmath60 and @xmath61 , in order to correct for the sample incompleteness that is inherent in the dropout technique .",
    "the results are the redshift selection functions at different brightness levels , which are shown in figure 3 .",
    "to derive these functions , we put 90,000 artificial galaxies into the wfc3 and the acs mosaics and calculated their rate of recovery @xmath60 after applying the same color criteria as we did when constructing our dropout samples .",
    "these artificial galaxies have different fluxes and morphologies , with 70% being exponential disks and 30% having the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "their sizes follow a log - normal distribution and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the peak size at flux @xmath64 and is normalized to @xmath19 at @xmath65  mag .",

    "the seds of the simulated galaxies were attenuated by the line - of - slight h i absorption according to the recipe of meiksin ( 2006 ) , which is very close to that of madau ( 1995 ) .    by calculating the ratio of the number of the recovered galaxies and that of the input ones",
    ", we obtained the selection function for the incompleteness correction .",

    "while a number of these issues have been mentioned in the above sections , we review them here before proceeding to discuss the statistical implications of our samples to astrophysical questions .",
    "there are two main factors that contribute to the incompleteness , which cause significant differences among samples as demonstrated in  3.3.1 and 3.3.2 .",
    "first of all , an object whose intrinsic brightness is above our sensitivity limit could be undetected because its observed brightness could fall below the detection threshold due to noise .",
    "secondly , a genuine @xmath0 galaxy that is detected in source extraction could still escape our color selection because it could be `` scattered '' out of the color selection region ( see figure 1 ) due to photometric error , or it could be incorrectly `` vetoed '' because of some unrelated events within its vicinity ( for example , noise spikes ) that accidentally increase its measured s / n in the veto images above the adopted quantitative veto threshold . both effects have been taken into account by our simulations , and therefore can be corrected statistically .",
    "the major factor that causes the contamination is the inclusion of low - redshift objects with spectral features that could mimic the lyman - break at @xmath0 .",
    "such contaminators could be selected because their @xmath43 colors meet our color threshold , either intrinsically , or after being boosted by photometric error ( i.e. , being scattered into the selection region ) . using the @xmath16 data ,",
    "our secondary @xmath82 criterion reduces the number of contaminators by rejecting those that have red seds . for other contaminators ,",
    "the best way to reject them is to check their visibility in the veto images . as discussed earlier , the quantitative criterion of s / n  @xmath41 gets rid of most of such objects , and the final step is the visual inspection .",
    "the caveat here is that we implicitly assume that the veto images are deep enough in detecting the contaminators in the blue bands , but this is not guaranteed .",
    "currently we do not have a reliable way to assess this effect .",
    "we point out that the rejection of contaminators based on their visibility in the veto images also introduces incompleteness , and that this happens both in the quantitative pre - screening ( requiring s / n  @xmath41 ) step and in the last visual inspection step .",
    "while the former can be statistically corrected by the simulations , the latter can not .",
    "our samples are unique in two aspects .",

    "an intriguing feature that our samples reveal is that there could be an excess of bright objects at @xmath128  mag with respect to any of the existing schechter lf estimates at @xmath0 in the literature would predict .",
    "the inferred number density at this bright end is even higher than the prediction from a non - evolution @xmath6 lf ( e.g. , the one from b11 ) .",
    "this excess is still evident with the observed counts _ before _ applying the incompleteness correction .",
    "the observed counts at @xmath128  mag in figure 5 comes from objects auto_048 and auto_100 .",
    "based on their photometry in @xmath15 and assuming @xmath129 , they have @xmath130 of @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively . while such high luminosities have been observed in the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath6 galaxies of ono et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , they are 59@xmath25 more luminous than any previously known @xmath14-dropouts . such an excess is unlikely due to cosmic variance , whose effect is expected to be small compared to the poisson errors for our observed number density if we use the formalism of trenti & stiavelli ( 2008 ) .",
    "we note that , however , that o12 do not see such an excess , even though their sample also includes our brightest candidate auto_048 .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy could be that o12 use a larger volume in the calculation . they have included part of the candels wide field in the goods - s region , which is a major contributor to their larger volume . however , this area does not have sufficiently deep @xmath14 data to apply our selection criterion of @xmath133  mag down to @xmath134  mag .",
    "o12 have adopted a less stringent criterion of @xmath135  mag , which allows them to construct a @xmath14-dropout sample in this area at the cost of including candidates at lower redshifts ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "the advantage of their approach is that they can incorporate the wfc3 ers field in the goods - s region as well , which further increases their survey volume .",
    "while the wfc3 ers field has @xmath85 but not @xmath14 data , the redshift range probed by their @xmath85-dropouts in this area overlaps that of their @xmath14-dropouts elsewhere , and therefore o12 has combined the @xmath85- and the @xmath14-dropouts to address the lf averaged over a wide redshift range ( @xmath68.7 ) .",
    "in contrast , our color criteria select galaxies in a higher range of redshifts , @xmath137 , and the bright - end excess ( with respect to a smooth schechter function ) that we find suggests that our understanding of the lf at @xmath0 is still far from being complete .",
    "the significance of this excess is still subject to small number statistics , and we can not rule out the possibility that one or both of our brightest objects could be interlopers at low redshifts . however , we should point out that similar bright - end excess at @xmath138 has also been suggested in other studies , for example in the bright @xmath85-dropout study in hippies ( yan et al .",
    "2011 ) at similar depths , in the ground - based survey of laporte et al .",
    "( 2011 ) at a brighter level , and in the much wider survey in capak et al .",
    "( 2011 ) at an even brighter limit .",
    "( @xmath139 ) for the candidates in capak et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the true nature of these objects still remains uncertain . ]",
    "our @xmath0 candidate galaxy samples have two very luminous objects and two high stellar mass objects .",
    "we have presented tentative evidence that the bright end of the galaxy lf at @xmath0 might not follow the exponential cut - off of the schechter function .",
    "while the stellar mass function at this redshift has not yet been determined , we have provided the first , albeit still tentative measurement at the high - mass end and shown that some galaxies with stellar masses as high as a few @xmath4  @xmath5 might already in place at @xmath0 .",
    "the physical origin of the exponential cut - off at the bright end of the lf or the high mass end of the mf seen at lower redshifts remains a matter of debate . at @xmath140 ,",
    "star formation is `` quenched '' in halos with masses greater than @xmath141  @xmath5 ( `` quenching mass '' ) , perhaps by agn feedback ( e.g. , croton et al .",
    "2006 ; somerville et al .",
    "2008 ; gabor et al .",
    "however , at higher redshift ( @xmath142 ) , the quenching mass may be higher ( dekel et al . 2009 ; behroozi et al . 2010 ) , and the existence of massive , rapidly star forming galaxies at @xmath143 is well established . at @xmath144 ,",
    "the observed exponential cut - off in the rest - frame uv lf appears to be due to dust ( reddy et al .",
    "2010 ) rather than quenching . at very high redshifts ,",
    "it has been noted before that the very blue rest - frame uv colors of @xmath6 candidate galaxies ( some of them confirmed ) suggest that they may contain little dust ( e.g. , oesch et al .",
    "2010 ; m10 ; y10 ; bunker et al .",
    "thus , at @xmath0 , when ( 1 ) the quenching mass is much higher than the typical halo mass , and ( 2 ) dust has little effect , perhaps we should not expect to see an exponential cutoff in the luminosity or mass functions of uv - bright galaxies .    it is interesting that the estimated stellar masses and number densities could imply a rather high efficiency of conversion of baryons into stars . for the lower stellar mass estimates , which are obtained using the models with nebular emission ( the average is @xmath145  @xmath5 ) , and assuming that @xmath146% of the available baryons have been converted to stars , the implied halo masses are on the order of @xmath147  @xmath5 , for which the expected number density of dark matter halos in the currently favored lcdm cosmology is comparable to the observed number density of objects .",
    "this is consistent with the predicted star formation efficiencies and host halo masses at @xmath0 from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "however , if the true stellar masses are higher , or the star formation efficiency is lower , a rapidly growing tension arises between the number density of dark matter halos and the observed number density of galaxies ( above halo mass @xmath147  @xmath5 , the halo number density declines by about two orders of magnitude for a factor of @xmath148 increase in mass ) .",
    "while converting 20% of the available baryons into stars may not sound excessive , this is in fact the _ maximum _ value that has been inferred at any epoch . due to the presumably very low metallicity of the gas in these early objects",
    ", we might have expected much lower star formation efficiencies than are seen locally ( e.g. krumholz & dekel 2010 ) .",
    "in this work , we search for candidate galaxies at @xmath0 in the candels deep goods - s field and study their properties .",
    "our sample of @xmath14-dropouts hints that the number density of @xmath0 galaxies at the bright - end might be higher than expected from the previous schechter lf estimates , which lends support to the suggestion made by a number of earlier studies that there could be a bright - end excess in the galaxy number density at very high redshifts .",
    "furthermore , two of our candidates are securely detected at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath31 m in _ spitzer _ data .",
    "these are the first @xmath14-dropouts individually detected at these wavelengths .",
    "their derived stellar masses are on the order of @xmath98  @xmath5 , from which we obtain the first measurement of the high - mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function at @xmath0 .",
    "if the high number densities of very luminous and very massive galaxies at @xmath0 are real , they could imply a large stellar - to - halo mass ratio and an efficient conversion of baryons to stars at very early time in the cosmic stellar mass assembly history .",

    ", we constructed a separate @xmath14-dropout sample to mimic an independent study .",
    "we used exactly the same data as in  2 , and therefore any difference in this sample should be attributed to the selection technique .",
    "we followed the same procedures as in  3 , but used mag_iso instead when calculating colors .",
    "the motivation of adopting mag_iso in this exercise is that isophotal apertures are commonly used in measuring lyman - break galaxy colors ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "2003 ) because they often lead to higher @xmath156 , even if they do not necessarily include all of the light from each galaxy .",
    "hereafter we refer to this sample as the `` iso sample '' to separate from the one described in the main text , which we refer to as the `` auto sample '' .",
    "the initial candidates in the iso sample were also visually examined by the same group of six inspectors .",
    "the visual inspection of this sample was done about one month later than that for the auto sample , and therefore even when we were examining the same object that is also in the auto sample we did not keep the memory of the result from the last time , and hence we mimicked an `` independent '' study as much as we could .",
    "the final iso sample consists of eleven candidates .",
    "6 shows their selection in the @xmath47 color space , while fig .",
    "7 shows the redshift selection function .",
    "images of these candidates are displayed in fig .",
    "table 2 lists their photometric information .",
    "-dropout sample .",
    "the labeled magnitude ranges are still based on mag_auto in @xmath15 , as the simulation only has control over the input total magnitudes , which are best represented by mag_auto . to be consistent ,",
    "the correction of @xmath157 for the iso sample is done at the corresponding mag_auto ranges .",
    ", width=226 ]        for the sake of completeness , we also compared the iso sample to the o12 s sample .",
    "based on the photometry reported in o12 , nine of their candidates are expected to meet our color criteria ( see also ",
    "however , only three of them are included in our iso sample ( see table 2 ) .",
    "among the five that are not in our sample , o12 s",
    "candy-2432246169 has @xmath58 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 and is not included in our mag_iso catalog .",
    "candy-2272447364 has @xmath158 in @xmath21 and does not satisfy our optical non - detection criterion .",
    "candy-2277945141 and 2320345371 have @xmath159 and 0.57  mag based on our photometry and hence do not meet out color criteria .",
    "the other two , o12 s candy-2209751370 and 2181852456 , meet all our color criteria , but were rejected during the visual inspection when constructing our iso sample .",
    "note that these latter two objects actually are in our auto sample ( auto_212 and 204 , respectively ) and survived the visual inspection for our auto sample ( see below ) .",
    "a more constructive comparision is that between this iso sample and the auto sample , which shows that they have four objects in common ( see table 2 ) .",
    "there are seven iso candidates not in the auto sample .",
    "five of them were rejected in the auto selection because they have s / n  @xmath160 within their mag_auto apertures in at least one veto image ( iso_011 , 017 , 157 , 158 , 160 ) .",
    "one was rejected because its mag_auto @xmath161 color limit does not satisfy @xmath162  mag ( iso_008 ) .",
    "the other one ( iso_082 ) satisfies all the quantitative criteria in the auto selection , however it was rejected in the visual inspection step during the auto selection run .    on the other hand ,",
    "four auto candidates are not in the iso sample .",
    "two of them were rejected because they have mag_auto @xmath161 color or limit below the @xmath162  mag threshold ( auto_094 and 368 ) .",
    "the other two satisfy all the quantitative criteria in the iso selection , however they were rejected in the visual inspection step during the iso selection run ( auto_204 and 212 ) .",
    "this internal comparison of our two samples thus further demonstrates the points addressed earlier : ( 1 ) adoption of different photometry result in samples that can be significantly different on an object - by - object basis , and ( 2 ) visual inspections at different time , especially the inspections of the veto images , can also result in differences in this sense because such inspections are not guaranteed to be fully repeatable for a large sample at the s / n@xmath41 level .    nevertheless , the main statistical trends revealed by the iso sample are very similar to those inferred from the auto sample .",
    "both samples include the same two bright @xmath14-dropouts ( auto_048/iso_085 and auto_100/iso_184 ) , and the same two irac - detected ones ( auto_293/iso_071 and auto_035/iso_063 ) . for completeness ,",
    "9 shows the constraint from the iso sample on the lf , where one can see that the bright - end excess is still present .",
    "similarly , the constraints on the mf and the stellar mass density derived from the iso sample agree with those based the auto sample to within @xmath163% , and the small differences are mainly caused by the slightly different @xmath61 corrections over the range of interest . from this exercise ,",
    "we believe that the main results presents in this work are robust .",
