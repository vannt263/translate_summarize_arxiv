    "the kovacs or memory effect has been observed by kovacs himself in the 1960s on structural glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "it is a surprising memory effect of the energy ( or volume ) of the system following a particular quenching procedure .",
    "this quenching procedure consists in suddenly cooling a glassy system from a high temperature ( infinite one in our case ) to a very low intermediate temperature @xmath0 and letting the system relax .",
    "when the waiting time @xmath1 necessary for the energy of the system to reach the equilibrium value for a final temperature @xmath2 is attained ( @xmath3 ) , the temperature of the system is set to this value @xmath4 .",
    "the result found by kovacs is that , even though the system is at the equilibrium energy ( the volume in his case ) corresponding to the temperature imposed , the system and its energy are still evolving .",
    "the system keeps memory of its history and of the fact that equilibrium is not effective . after a rapid increase of the energy ,",
    "the system reaches the equilibrium and the energy decreases and levels off that equilibrium leading to a hump in the energy as function of time .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in a comparison of the kovacs effect for two simple ( even simplistic ) models with respectively strong and fragile glass behaviours .",
    "we consider the symmetric and purely asymmetric kinetically constrained ising chain ( kcic ) models  @xcite .",
    "this simple change of the kinetic constraints allows one to switch respectively from strong to fragile glass behaviour . the underlying equilibrium being the same for both models , a direct comparison of the dynamical effects is possible .",
    "after a short presentation of the models in section 2 , the kovacs effect is discussed in section 3 . the effect is observed in both models considered but is enhanced in the asymmetric case .",
    "this section also contains simple rescaling arguments to explain this effect and a comparison with recent works on the kovacs effect  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) relations are studied during the kovacs quenching procedure and presented in section 4 .",
    "the fd relations satisfy the fd theorem in both cases .",
    "these results are in strong contradiction with those obtained using a simple quenching procedure from high temperature to a low final temperature after a waiting time @xmath1 .",
    "this last quenching procedure leads to fd relations satisfying the fd theorem for the symmetric kcic model and for waiting times well below the relaxation time .",
    "in contrast , strong deviations from the fd theorem have been observed for the asymmetric kcic model for waiting times smaller than the equilibration time .",
    "we give some conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this paper , we are interested in the possible difference concerning the kovacs effect due to strong or fragile glass behaviour .",
    "we thus consider the kcic model  @xcite for which constraints may be chosen to model strong ( for symmetric ones ) and fragile ( for a purely asymmetric chain ) glass relaxations .",
    "let us consider a chain of @xmath5 ising spins ( @xmath6 with @xmath7 ) without interactions where spins @xmath8 are considered as defects .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is thus trivial ( @xmath9 ) as well as the equilibrium thermodynamic properties .",
    "the equilibrium energy at temperature @xmath10 or inverse temperature @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 which is also the concentration of defects or the probability to have a defect at site @xmath13 .",
    "it is possible to determine exactly the probability for a defect to have its next defect ( on the left ) at a distance @xmath14 @xmath15 the first term on the right hand side of the equation corresponds to the probability to have a defect whereas the second term ( with a power @xmath16 ) is the probability to have no defects in the intermediate @xmath16 sites .",
    "the non - interacting spins render at equilibrium the probabilities at each sites independent of each other and leads to this simple product in @xmath17 .",
    "all these equilibrium properties are independent of any dynamics considered .",
    "however , the introduction of kinetic constraints allows one to obtain a slowing down of the dynamics characteristic of glassy systems before the equilibrium properties are reached .",
    "the probability for a spin to flip is constrained in the following way : in the symmetric case , a spin is able to flip as soon as a neighbour ( left or right ) is a defect whereas , in the asymmetric case , the defect has to be on the left .",
    "such spins are also called spin facilitated and their probability transitions are given by the following equation : @xmath18 the first term on the right hand side corresponds to the usual metropolis probability and allows one to satisfy the detailed balance .",
    "the second term corresponds to the general kinetic constraints with a probability @xmath19 to flip the spin if there is a left neighbour and @xmath20 for a right neighbour . the symmetric model ( @xmath21 ) and the purely asymmetric one ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) correspond to particular values of this parameter @xmath19 .",
    "these models have been extensively studied ( for more information and references on kinetically constrained models see the recent review by ritort and sollich  @xcite ) . with the symmetric constraints ,",
    "the dynamical behaviour is reminiscent of a strong glass with a relaxation time following an arrhenius law . at sufficiently low temperature ,",
    "the defects are mainly isolated and may be considered as simple particles diffusing with a temperature - dependent rate of diffusion @xmath24 .",
    "the energy ( or concentration of particles ) evolves through creation and annihilation processes .",
    "similar reaction - diffusion models have been introduced for a long time to study domain growth , coarsening and aging  @xcite . within the asymmetric constraints ,",
    "the energy barriers involved in the motion of defects are increasing logarithmically with the distance from the next defect  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the relaxation time follows the bssler law  @xcite : @xmath25 .",
    "whereas the arrhenius behaviour is associated to a strong glass behaviour following the angell s classification  @xcite , the super - arrhenius behaviour of the asymmetric model is associated to a fragile glass .",
    "intermediate constraints allow the system to continuously crossover from fragile to strong glass behaviour  @xcite but will not be considered in this study .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the kovacs effect is observed following a particular quenching procedure . at time @xmath26 , a system , equilibrated at high temperature ( @xmath27 in our case ) , is suddenly quenched to an intermediate low temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the system starts to relax and the energy decreases until it reaches the equilibrium energy corresponding to a final temperature @xmath4 after a waiting time @xmath28 defined by the following equation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy of the system at time @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the inverse temperature . the temperature of the system is set to @xmath2 at this waiting time @xmath1 .",
    "if the system was characterized only by the thermodynamical parameters ( energy , volume and temperature ) , we would expect the energy of the system to stay constant and equal to @xmath33 after the waiting time @xmath1 . however , even though its energy corresponds to that equilibrium one at the imposed temperature , the particular configuration of the system at @xmath1 is still far from an equilibrium configuration at @xmath2 . as a consequence",
    ", the energy is still evolving after @xmath1 .",
    "the figure  [ kovacssym ] illustrates the kovacs effect for the symmetric kcic model  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen on the left panel , the kovacs effect is an increasing function of the difference between the intermediate and final temperatures .",
    "a two timescale behaviour is also clearly observed .",
    "the energy increases on a timescale @xmath34 to reach a plateau followed by a further increase up to a maximum .",
    "the energy finally decreases to reach the equilibrium energy at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "note also that the maximum in energy decreases and shifts to slightly higher times for higher intermediate temperatures @xmath0 .",
    "this result was already observed for the volume by kovacs  @xcite and for the energy in recent simulations  @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the energy is obtained for a timescale @xmath35 .",
    "this timescale is of the same order as the equilibrium timescale @xmath36 ( time to reach the equilibrium after a rapid quench from a high temperature to a low temperature @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath37 dependence of @xmath36 is explained considering that the energy @xmath30 after such a quench decays like the annihilation process @xmath38 in one dimension with a diffusion rate @xmath39 : @xmath40 .",
    "the energy thus reaches that equilibrium ( @xmath41 ) after an equilibrium time @xmath42 due to the temperature - dependent diffusion rate ( @xmath43 ) . with a similar argument it is possible to estimate the waiting time @xmath44 where the equilibrium energy to reach is @xmath41 but the diffusion rate is @xmath45 since the temperature of the system before @xmath1",
    "is set to @xmath0 .",
    "we recover the equilibrium time when @xmath46 .",
    "the estimate of the waiting time agrees qualitatively with the values obtained from numerical simulations for the different couples of intermediate and final temperatures considered .",
    "let us now analyse the short timescales behaviour .",
    "the fast increase of the energy is related to the probability @xmath47 to have neighbouring defects .",
    "such a probability is given at @xmath1 by @xmath48 where @xmath3 is the probability to have a defect at @xmath1 and @xmath49 is the probability for its neighbour to also be a defect .",
    "this last term corresponds to the equilibrium probability @xmath50 due to the fact that the timescale to equilibrate the concentration of neighbouring defects ( or non - constrained defects ) is @xmath51 and has thus already equilibrated at @xmath1 .",
    "when the temperature is increased from the low temperature @xmath0 to a higher one @xmath2 , on a similar timescale @xmath52 independent of the temperature , the probability to have neighbouring defects reaches its equilibrium value @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , the timescale for the motion of defects is @xmath54 . as a consequence , the change of probability from @xmath47 to @xmath55",
    "is mainly obtained from the creation of defects and the energy as function of time may be expressed as @xmath56 where we expect @xmath57 to be independent of both intermediate and final temperatures for @xmath58 and to start to differ at @xmath59 for different @xmath2 .",
    "this prediction is verified on the right panel of figure  [ kovacssym ] where @xmath60 is plotted for different couples @xmath61 on short times @xmath62 .    on longer timescales ,",
    "the activated regime is involved .",
    "the defects may then be considered as simple particles moving with a temperature - dependent diffusion rate @xmath63 .",
    "the number of particles ( or energy ) evolves through creation of neighbouring defects and annihilation when two defects collide ( @xmath64 ) . as we have seen with the short timescales behaviour , the energy increases after the waiting time @xmath1 .",
    "this increase is not restricted to the short timescales but continues on longer timescales and is due to the fact that the distribution of distances between defects @xmath65 at the different waiting times @xmath66 is far from the equilibrium one @xmath67 ( see eq.([eqpd ] ) for definition ) .",
    "this difference is evident on the right panel of figure  [ kovacssym2 ] .",
    "the distribution @xmath65 converges to that equilibrium when the intermediate temperature reaches the final one as it should .",
    "one important point is that the whole range of the distribution is affected .",
    "defects with neighbouring defects at all distances relax with the same typical timescale due to the single energy barrier involved ( the motion of a defect from one site to the next one is independent of the distance from its neighbouring defect ) .",
    "the interpretation with diffusive particles and with annihilation - creation processes is similar to coarsening models .",
    "the only differences with the 1d ising model concern the diffusive rate which is temperature - dependent in our case and the creation - annihilation processes which are of the type @xmath68 in the ising model .",
    "this analogy to domain growth models allows us to use the same rescaling for long timescales of the kovacs effect . in recent works",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that , for domain growth models , the energy shift from the equilibrium energy may be rescaled for all intermediate temperatures @xmath0 in the following way : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the time for which the shift in energy from the equilibrium energy already diminished by a factor two from its maximum value @xmath71 as can be seen on the left panel of figure  [ kovacssym2 ] , this rescaling is correct for the long timescales . for short timescales , a small deviation from this rescaling is observed .      in figure",
    "[ compar ] , we compare the kovacs effects for the symmetric and asymmetric kcic models .",
    "the energy as function of the time @xmath62 since the final temperature @xmath72 was set to the system is plotted for different intermediate temperatures @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as can be seen ,",
    "the short timescales behaviour ( non - activated ) is similar in both models .",
    "the same rescaling introduced for the symmetric kcic model works perfectly on short timescales for the asymmetric kcic model ( see left panel of figure  [ kovacsasym ] ) .",
    "the argument developed to obtain the rescaling is independent of the dynamical constraints as soon as the motion of particles occurs on timescales larger than the spontaneous creation of neighbouring defects .",
    "on longer timescales , when activation plays an important role , the kovacs effect starts to differ between the symmetric and asymmetric kcic models .",
    "the main result is a higher maximum of the energy for the asymmetric case .",
    "the timescales involved are also not surprisingly different due to equilibration times which strongly differ from strong to fragile glass behaviour .",
    "this can also be traced out on the values of the waiting times @xmath66 larger for the asymmetric kcic model ( fragile glass behaviour ) than for the symmetric kcic model ( strong glass behaviour ) . from the analysis of sollich and evans  @xcite , it is possible to have an estimate of the waiting time @xmath75 for the asymmetric kcic model .",
    "the same creation - annihilation processes occur as for the symmetric kcic model but the motion of particles may not be considered as simple diffusion due to the increasing energy barriers with the distance between defects .",
    "an anomalous coarsening occurs where the energy decreases like @xmath76 with a temperature - dependent exponent in contrast to normal coarsening .",
    "the waiting time is obtained when the energy reaches the equilibrium energy @xmath41 leading to @xmath77 .",
    "note that once again we recover the equilibrium timescale @xmath78 when @xmath46 .",
    "the estimate for the waiting time agrees qualitatively with the values obtained from the numerical simulations for different couples of intermediate and final temperatures .",
    "we use the rescaling for the long timescales of coarsening models ( [ rescal ] ) ( see right panel of figure  [ kovacsasym ] ) as for the symmetric kcic model .",
    "we observe some deviations from a perfect rescaling even for the long timescales .",
    "this difference is due to the anomalous coarsening behaviour of the asymmetric kcic model .",
    "the failure of the rescaling on short timescales is also more evident .",
    "the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) theorem is usually present in glassy systems due to the out  of  equilibrium dynamics ( see for example the recent review by crisanti and ritort  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "fd relations have already been considered for the symmetric and asymmetric kcic models in  @xcite with the usual quenching procedure .",
    "a more careful analysis of the symmetric case leads to the conclusion that even far from equilibrium ( at least after a short transient ) , the fd relations satisfy the fd theorem for all temperatures and waiting times  @xcite .",
    "this result was explained by the fact that defects are mainly isolated at low temperatures after a short transient and behave as in local equilibrium ( with a temperature - dependent diffusive rate @xmath79 ) even if the number of defects is larger than in equilibrium .",
    "this argument is no longer valid for the asymmetric case where the motion of a defect is dependent on the position of its left neighbour defect and is thus sensitive to the total number of defects or at least to the distribution of distances between defects which is out  of  equilibrium .",
    "the differences between the fd relations for both models are evident in figure  [ fdt1 ] following the usual quenching procedure .",
    "we consider such fd relations after the kovacs quenching procedure to check if this discrepancy between the two models is also present .",
    "let us first explain how those fd relations are determined .",
    "the integrated response is determined following the now standard procedure introduced by barrat  @xcite .",
    "a pertubation @xmath80 is added to the hamiltonian where @xmath81 is a field of strength @xmath82 introduced after the waiting time @xmath1 ( @xmath83 is the heaviside function ) .",
    "random fields are set to each site through the random variables @xmath84 with identical probabilities .",
    "the integrated response is then @xmath85 with the overline standing for an average over the random variables @xmath86 and the brackets for the dynamical average in the presence of the perturbation .",
    "note that in these kinetically constrained models different dynamics may be considered after the introduction of the perturbation .",
    "we considered the modified metropolis one discussed in  @xcite which gives similar results to the metropolis one in this case  @xcite .",
    "the integrated response has to be compared to the corresponding correlations to check the validity of the fd theorem . in the case where the energy is still evolving the correct correlations to consider are the connected ones @xmath87 where @xmath30 is the energy at time @xmath31 and the brackets stand for the dynamical average without the perturbation . in equilibrium ,",
    "the integrated response and correlations only depend on the difference of times and satisfy : @xmath88 .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that a correct generalization of this expression for systems out  of  equilibrium is @xmath89 with @xmath90 . if the fd theorem is satisfied the function @xmath91 .",
    "thus , a parametric plot of the integrated response with respect to the function @xmath92 allows one to check the validity of the fd theorem .",
    "note that in these kinetically constrained systems , @xmath93 depends on time .",
    "this explains the parametric plot with respect to @xmath94 instead of the two - time correlation @xmath95 .",
    "a slope @xmath96 different than @xmath23 in this parametric plot would suggest the existence of an effective temperature @xmath97 .    in figure  [ fdt1 ]",
    ", we have plotted the fd relations for both symmetric ( left ) and asymmetric ( right ) kcic models following the usual quenching procedure . at @xmath26 ,",
    "the system is quenched from an infinite temperature to a low temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the perturbation is introduced at a waiting time @xmath1 after this quench . on the left panel , the fd relations for the symmetric kcic model satisfy the fd theorem for a large set of temperatures and waiting times ( as soon as @xmath98 ) .",
    "the validity of the fd theorem is far from obvious if we keep in mind that both the integrated response and @xmath94 are non  monotonic .",
    "however , they compensate each other to follow the fd theorem curve at all times .",
    "the non  monotonic behaviour of the response is due to the decrease of the energy on long timescales . when rescaled by the energy",
    ", the response is continously increasing .",
    "for the asymmetric kcic model , the fd relations show strong deviation from the fd theorem .",
    "the non - monotonic integrated response can not be accounted for by the difference of correlations @xmath94 as it is for the symmetric kcic model .",
    "it leads to different humps in the fd relations corresponding to the different plateaus observed in the decay of the energy .",
    "the increasing energy barriers ( @xmath99 ) lead to those different plateaus in the energy decay after a quench in temperature  @xcite .",
    "the fd theorem is recovered for sufficiently large waiting times ( for @xmath100 when @xmath101 for example ) .",
    "let us now consider the fd relations for the symmetric ( left ) and asymmetric ( right ) kcic models after the kovacs quenching procedure ( see figure  [ fdt ] ) . as can be seen in both cases the fd theorem is verified .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the evolution of the energy which shows a deviation from equilibrium .",
    "this deviation is sufficiently important to exclude the fact that it does not show up on the fd relations . in figure  [ resp ]",
    "we can observe that the responses for different intermediate temperatures as well as the energies and the correlations are different .",
    "however , the fd theorem is satisfied .",
    "note for example that when @xmath0 is highly slower than @xmath2 , the response shows a hump which may be related directly to the fact that the energy is not constant .",
    "an increasing energy , corresponding to a larger number of defects , tends to increase the response .",
    "the further decrease of the response is then related to the same decrease in the energy .",
    "the consequence on the fd relations is that the parametric curve increases from the origin to a maximum before a small decrease occurs but always following the line @xmath91 corresponding to the fd theorem curve .",
    "the fact that the fd relations follow the fd theorem curve for the symmetric kcic model is not surprising since it is already the case after a usual quenching procedure . a simple explanation suggesting that defects are in local equilibrium has been given .",
    "the surprise comes from the asymmetric kcic model where the fd relations differ strongly from the fd theorem curve for most waiting times with the usual quenching procedure . with the kovacs one ,",
    "the fd relations follow the fd theorem curve .",
    "a possible argument would be the following .",
    "the waiting times involved in the kovacs quenching procedure are sufficiently large that the out  of  equilibrium configuration may be considered as equivalent to a simple fluctuation in the system at equilibrium . in other words the linear regime is attained and the fd theorem is satisfied . however",
    ", this argument would not explain the shift in energy observed .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the kovacs effect for the symmetric and asymmetric kcic models with respectively strong and fragile glass behaviours .",
    "the effect is stronger in the asymmetric case .",
    "the symmetric kcic model satisfies the same rescaling as domain growth models for long timescales .",
    "some small deviations are present for the asymmetric kcic model and may be explained due to the anomalous coarsening . the short timescales behaviour is identical for both models and a simple argument allows one to rescale all simulations for different intermediate and final temperatures on the same leading curve which happens to be independent of the dynamics ( identical for the symmetric and asymmetric kcic models ) .",
    "we have also studied the fd relations for both models after a kovacs quenching and a usual one .",
    "after the kovacs quenching , the related fd relations verify surprisingly the fd theorem for both models in strong contrast with the results for the asymmetric kcic model using the usual quenching procedure .",
    "no clear explanation has been found for this behaviour .",
    "it could be interesting to have a look at the kovacs effect and the corresponding fd relations using the models introduced in  @xcite where analytical results may be expected due to the possible exact mean - field solution .",
    "the author would like to thank r. calemczuk for useful discussions and a careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "99                                        numerical simulations have been done using the continuous time algorithm  @xcite on systems of size @xmath102 and averaged on @xmath103 runs . for the fd relations ,",
    "the strength of the field @xmath104 was sufficient to be in the linear regime ."
