    "in hierarchical models of galaxy formation , galaxies are built up from many smaller pieces .",
    "theoretical work has shown that the destruction of a dwarf galaxy that is much smaller than its parent system is likely to leave observable signatures in phase space , with debris from the accreted dwarf simply phase - mixing along its original orbit ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mixing time depends on the dwarf s mass and orbit , and is shortest for the most massive dwarfs in the inner galaxy . in this case",
    "the debris can become difficult to detect spatially within a few gyrs of its creation , but remains dynamically cold and identifiable in the form of moving groups of stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "several examples of such groups have been identified in our own milky way ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the outer galaxy",
    "the debris forms streams that can maintain coherence for many gyrs ( @xcite ) and whose evolution can be described approximately using simple analytic estimates ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the prime example of such debris that has been found from its overdensity in star counts rather than kinematics is that associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , recent results from ssds on the magnitude distribution of a - colored stars ( @xcite ) and rr lyrae variables ( @xcite ) suggest that the milky way s stellar halo becomes quite lumpy beyond 2030  kpc .",
    "bullock , kravtsov & weinberg ( 2001 ) have used semi - analytic galaxy formation models to show that such substructure is consistent with the hierarchical view of structure formation .",
    "the multitude of recent theoretical and observational results on streamers in the milky way naturally leads to the question of what we might expect to see around external galaxies .",
    "the latter have the advantage of being non - unique ( and thus offer the opportunity of building a sample of results to evaluate `` typical '' galaxy properties ) , but the disadvantage of being restricted to streamers seen from a single random viewing angle . in external galaxies ,",
    "only surface brightnesses and line - of - sight velocities are available ; galactic streamers offer the potential for full phase - space information .",
    "one might ask , for example , whether the debris from the sagittarius dwarf ( sgr ) would be observable from a viewpoint outside the milky way .",
    "ibata et al .  (",
    "2000 ) have reported finding 38 faint , high - latitude , carbon stars in their survey covering galactic latitudes @xmath4 that lie within 10  degrees of the projected orbit of sgr . by appropriately scaling the @xcite survey for carbon stars in the central regions of sgr",
    "they calculate @xmath5 carbon stars should lie in the dwarf itself . since sgr is estimated to have a total @xmath6 luminosity of @xmath7@xmath8 ( @xcite ) and presently be on an orbit oscillating between @xmath7@xmath9kpc and @xmath7@xmath10kpc , the carbon star result suggests a streamer of debris ejected in the last few gyrs ( carbon stars have intermediate ages ) with a total luminosity of @xmath7@xmath11 and physical dimensions of @xmath75  kpc by @xmath7250  kpc .",
    "viewed from a distant external galaxy , such a streamer would have an average surface brightness of @xmath7@xmath12v  mag / arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "this rough calculation is in agreement with estimates of @xmath14=30 - 31 for the surface brightness of debris over 30 degrees away from the main body of sgr mag / arcsec@xmath3 , from both main sequence ( @xcite ) and giant star ( @xcite ) overdensities in the region .",
    "in addition , a recent paper ( @xcite ) reports a similar surface brightness for a population of star possibly associated with sgr in the northern galactic hemisphere over 50kpc from the galactic center . since streamer luminosity is not smoothly distributed , but instead has the largest surface brightness at apocenter , the brightest portions of debris trails like that of sgr around an external galaxy are likely to be just at current limits of detection ( see   3 , 5 ) .",
    "many examples of low surface brightness features already have been detected around other galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "a particularly fine example is the streamer in ngc  5907 ( @xcite ) which we discuss further in  4.2.1 .",
    "the combination of observations of substructure in the milky way s stellar halo with the existence of features around external galaxies motivates us to apply theoretical work on the evolution of debris about the milky way and ask what we might expect to see around other galaxies .",
    "we review the relevant dynamics and present analytic expressions for the evolution of the geometry of tidal streams in  2 . in ",
    "3 we discuss under what circumstances such streams should be observable by comparing our prediction for their surface brightness with the background contamination from their parent galaxy s disk , bulge and halo light . in ",
    "4 we apply our results to : interpreting the debris seen around ngc 5907 ; placing limits on the mass loss rate from satellites of m31 ; and exploring whether the number of features seen around external galaxies might be of interest in the context of hierarchical models of galaxy formation . we discuss future observational prospects in  5 and conclude in  6 .",
    "in this section we develop analytic expressions for the morphology of tidal streamers and compare them with the results of simulations of satellite galaxy destruction . in all these simulations , with the exception of those used for the blue and green points in figure [ wvst.fig ] ,",
    "the parent galaxy potential was fixed , with bulge , disk and halo components as described in the work of johnston , hernquist & bolte ( 1996 ) . in the other cases",
    "the halo potential was replaced by a flattened analog that generated the same rotation curve in the disk plane but had axis ratio @xmath15 in density . in all cases ,",
    "the satellite galaxy was represented by particles initially distributed as a plummer model , whose mutual interactions were calculated using a basis function expansion code ( @xcite ) .",

    ". [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     choi & guhathakurta ( 2001 ) have recently completed a ccd mosaic of m31 which allows them to measure the outer isophotes of m32 and ngc  205 to a limiting surface brightness of @xmath1627 mag / arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "although their survey does reveal interesting features at low surface brightness levels close to each satellite , they are unable to trace these features beyond more than a couple of tidal radii . adopting a value of @xmath17km / s ( @xcite ) for m31 s dark halo we can calculate an upper limit to @xmath18 for each satellite using their dynamical masses , observed @xmath19 and projected distances from m31 ( see table [ satstab ] ) .",
    "this example is intended only as an illustration ; at this limiting surface brightness level , the limits on @xmath18 are very weak . in these particular cases ,",
    "a stronger limit may be found by looking at the features close to each satellite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "can cosmological models of galaxy formation be tested using a sensitive survey for debris trails ?",
    "n - body simulations naturally incorporate the physics of tidal disruption and debris dispersal . with additional assumptions about the relationship between the formation of stars and the dark halo in which they reside , the frequency of low surface brightness features observable around galaxies today",
    "could be predicted within a given cosmological model .",
    "this approach is limited by the resolution of the simulations to placing only lower limits on the number of trails we might expect to observe .",
    "first , as with identifying halos , there will be a mass limit below which a stream from a disrupted halo will not be resolved ( presumably at higher mass than the satellite itself since the particles represent lower surface brightness features ) .",
    "second , the finite resolution will cause random potential fluctuations that will scatter particles ( i.e. , numerical relaxation  see @xcite for a general discussion ) and tend to artificially reduce the surface brightness of debris streams . for example , johnston , spergel & haydn ( 2001 ) found that a minimum of @xmath20 particles were needed in the parent milky way - like halo in order for a trail from a @xmath21 satellite following an sgr - like orbit to maintain its coherence over 4  gyrs .",
    "this finding is clearly dependent on the mass and orbit of the satellite and the mass distribution in the parent galaxy , but nevertheless indicates the scale of the problem .",
    "it suggests that an appropriate n - body approach would be to simulate @xmath7100 such galaxies , each with @xmath20 particles within a cosmological context and then analyze them to assess the number of trails expected to be observed around a similar sample of real galaxies .    one way of testing whether such a computationally expensive study is warranted is to model satellite accretion history in a semi - analytic fashion that allows multiple realizations to be performed rather quickly , thus providing ample statistics and the ability to probe a large parameter space of input assumptions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "current models of this kind use monte - carlo methods based on the extended press - schechter formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and have proven successful at reproducing the merging histories of dark halos seen in n - body simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as with n - body simulations , associating galaxies and stars with dark halos must be done using some prescription .",
    "in addition , for application to satellite debris observations , some assumptions about the orbital distributions and the tidal disruption of the accreted objects must be made .",
    "the morphology and surface brightness of the streamers can then be predicted using methods presented here and in johnston ( 1998 ) . unlike the n - body case ,",
    "this approach , although less exact , suffers from no resolution limits .      as an illustration of this idea",
    ", we have used the model of bullock , kravtsov & weinberg ( 2001 ) to provide the accretion histories of an ensemble of 100 halos , each with final @xmath22  km  s@xmath23 , which are assumed to host milky way - type galaxies .",
    "the model assumes a @xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26,and @xmath27 , and provides masses , approximate disruption times , and orbital evolution for each disrupted satellite .",
    "we estimate the mass - to - light ratios of the disrupted satellites by applying the same hypothesis used by bullock , kravtsov & weinberg ( 2000 ) to match the observed abundance of local group satellites today : that low - mass satellites with virial temperatures below @xmath28k ( @xmath29 km s@xmath23 ) can only accrete gas before the universe was reionized . ] at @xmath30 . under this assumption",
    ", the final baryonic mass of a satellite halo of mass @xmath31 will be @xmath32 . if @xmath33  km s@xmath23 , @xmath34 represents the fraction of the halo s mass that was in place at @xmath30 .",
    "( we assume @xmath35 . ) for halos with sufficiently deep potential wells ( @xmath36  km s@xmath23 ) the photoionizing background will not affect gas accretion , and @xmath37 for intermediate masses , we assume that @xmath38 varies linearly between @xmath34 and @xmath39 as the halo size varies from @xmath40 to @xmath41  km s@xmath23 ( @xcite )",
    ". finally , if a fraction @xmath42 of this baryonic mass is converted to a stellar population with current mass - to - light ratio @xmath43 , this implies @xmath44 . with @xmath45 and the other disrupted satellite properties provided by the model",
    ", we then use equation  ( [ mu ] ) to estimate the surface brightness of features today .",
    "the closed and open symbols in the top panel of figure  [ cosmo.fig ] indicate the final positions in the @xmath46 plane of all disruption events in our simulated ensemble that that satisfy our age criterion , @xmath47 , and have occurred since each parent galaxy has accreted 90% of its mass .",
    "the latter requirement was imposed to ensure that additional orbit evolution of the debris is unlikely to be an important effect .",
    "since the age of accretion events decreases with distance from the parent galaxy , one consequence of this requirement is that most of the trails have @xmath48 kpc .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath49 with decreasing age also accounts for the fact that trails at large radii have higher average surface brightness than those at smaller radii .",
    "plotting against @xmath49 in figure  [ cosmo.fig ] does not directly illustrate the expected distribution of debris because most of the satellites were destroyed along eccentric orbits with @xmath50 .",
    "this is reflected in the distribution of the closed symbols which indicate the subset of these events that also satisfy our criterion , @xmath51 .",
    "the total number of features brighter than a given surface brightness is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ cosmo.fig ] , indicating clearly that , within the chosen cosmology and star - formation prescription , we would expect to see many tens of features brighter than @xmath52  mag arcsec@xmath53 ( about ten of which satisfy @xmath51 and hence are easiest to interpret ) in such a survey of 100 parent galaxies . moreover , these features tend to lie at large ( @xmath54  kpc ) radii from their parent galaxy where they are less likely to be confused by background disk , bulge or halo light .",
    "7 shows that only very extended stellar halos are brighter than @xmath55  mag arcsec@xmath53 or @xmath56  mag arcsec@xmath53 at @xmath57  kpc . )",
    "we defer to a future paper a more complete discussion of the dependence of satellite debris characteristics on star formation prescription and cosmology . in the next section",
    "we discuss the feasibility of such an observational survey .",
    "the apparent scarcity of observed debris streamers in external galaxies need not necessarily imply that they are not present , since the arguments we have presented indicate that most are probably at or below current detection levels .",
    "special photographic emulsions may provide an excellent way of searching for such features over a wide field ( @xcite ) , but calibration of the surface brightness levels needed for the best modeling will likely rely on charge coupled devices ( @xcite ) .",
    "since more photons are available for imaging than spectroscopy of individual lines , detection of low surface brightness features in external galaxies will always be easier than the measurement of their line - of - sight velocities .    for ease of detection",
    ", one would like : + 1.25 cm @xmath58 $ ] clear detection of diffuse light several magnitudes below sky + 1.25 cm @xmath59 $ ] simultaneous imaging of the complete streamer and the background sky + 1.25 cm @xmath60 $ ] minimal confusion from astronomical backgrounds + 1.25 cm @xmath61 $ ] control over systematic uncertainties , eg .",
    ", flat - fielding and scattered light + the first goal requires a large number of photons , and the second a large detector .",
    "the third goal can be partially addressed with appropriate target selection (  3.2 ) , while the last will require care in instrument design and observational strategy . in principle , the last goal is likely be the most difficult to achieve , but the first two are necessary , if not sufficient , conditions .",
    "we thus focus now on meeting the first and second goals with current and future instrumentation , namely the advanced wide field camera ( acs / wfc ) on the 2.4 m hst , the fors imaging system on the 8 m vlt , and proposed super - aperture telescopes , such as the 30 celt or 100 m owl .    using ngc  5907 as a guide",
    ", we consider the possibility of detecting a streamer with an observed length of 50  kpc and width of 5  kpc , to a depth that is one magnitude fainter than the average surface brightness r = 28  mag  arcsec@xmath53 currently measured for the ngc  5907 arc .",
    "a rough upper limit to the physical size of the required field is 400  kpc , which allows 200  kpc on either side of the center of a galactic potential well for detection of satellite tails ( see figs .  6 and  [ cosmo.fig ] )",
    ". the angular size of the required field will depend on the distance to the galaxy ; a 400  kpc field corresponds to about 800  at 100  mpc .",
    "we now ask how long an integration time would be needed on various instruments in order to acquire the photons required for a @xmath62 detection of an area of the streamer equal to its typical width squared .",
    "since a streamer might be expected to have a length at least 10 times its width (  2.2 ) , the complete streamer would then lie @xmath7@xmath63 above the background noise .",
    "spaced - based observations such as those with the acs / wfc have the advantage of low sky background , but also have smaller apertures relative to the most powerful ground - based imaging instrumentation .",
    "the @xmath7200  field of the acs / wfc is well - matched to primary galaxies at 400  mpc , for which a total exposure of @xmath71  hour is required to achieve the desired s / n with the standard configuration in typical conditions .",
    "the @xmath7400field size of the fors imaging system on the vlt is suited to more nearby galaxies at distances of 200  mpc , for which @xmath712  minutes is required to reach the fiducial photon noise in typical , dark conditions on paranal .",
    "a streamer of similar size , but @xmath64 = 30  mag  arcsec@xmath53 , would yield the required photon s / n in 1.5  hours with the vlt .",
    "the increased aperture afforded by planned telescopes such as celt or owl could reduce this time by factors of 3 to 10 .",
    "exposure times with the acs could be halved if the search was resticted to streamers of similar angular ( rather than physical ) size as those probed by the vlt . in general , however , for the simple comparison made here , larger aperture wins over the reduced sky background .",
    "we stress that the reliability of very faint detections will be dominated by systematics rather than photon noise , so that these estimates should be considered a strict lower limit to the total time required .",
    "experience suggests that at surface brightnesses of @xmath65  28  mag  arcsec@xmath53 , systematic uncertainties are comparable to photon noise in their contribution to the error budget , so that exposure times 2 to 4 times longer than those estimated from photon statistics are required to realistically achieve the desired total s / n . at fainter levels , systematic uncertainties may completely dominate unless extreme care is taken in observational strategy and instrument design .",
    "finally , note that imaging designed to reliably _",
    "debris streamers along their length will require considerably longer ( @xmath66 ) exposures than those aimed at detection only .",
    "nevertheless , these estimates indicate that searches for young debris trails as faint as @xmath67  29  mag  arcsec@xmath53 are feasible now around a sample of galaxies 200  mpc distant from us .",
    "planned super - aperture telescopes would allow the study of a fainter and older streamers around a larger sample of primaries .",
    "we have developed and tested in this paper a simple semi - analytic formalism for following the surface brightness and morphology of debris during the first few orbits after a satellite is destroyed .",
    "using the properties of local group satellites and extended light distributions around external galaxies we discussed to what extent the parent galaxy s light should obscure such features .",
    "we then applied our models to three representative astronomical applications : ( 1 ) estimation of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath0 and streamer age of the totally disrupted satellite responsible for ngc  5907 s debris arc , ( 2 ) derivation of the upper limit to the mass - loss rate @xmath68 of partially - destroyed satellites such as would be expected for m32 or ngc  205 , and ( 3 ) exploration of galaxy formation in a @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "we find that the debris trail in ngc  5907 is well - modeled by disruption of a satellite with mass @xmath69 and mass - to - light ratio @xmath70 originally on an orbit of approximate radius @xmath71  kpc disrupting @xmath72  gyrs ago .",
    "we also find that the lack of very bright debris associated with the satellites of m31 indicates mass - loss rates @xmath73  gyr@xmath23 . finally , we find that a first examination of realizations of 100 galaxies in a standard @xmath1cdm cosmology , yields over forty features brighter than @xmath74  30  mag / arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "such @xmath6 surface brightnesses are at the limit of current capabilities , but  if systematics can be controlled  may become routine with proposed telescopes such as owl or celt , allowing surveys for satellite debris in external galaxies to yield constraints on hierarchical models of galaxy formation .",
