    "`` resource / service as a utility '' once a dream , is now a reality we are living with .",
    "utility computing is not a new concept , but rather it has quite a long history . among the earliest references",
    "is by john mccarthy .",
    "last two decades of information technology ( it ) development has witnessed the specific efforts done to make this statement of john mccarthy a reality .",
    "utility computing is providing basics for the current day resource utilization .",
    "cluster , grids and now cloud computing have made this vision a reality .",
    "e - collaborations also called _ virtual organizations _ have been evolved with the technological and paradigm shift .",
    "cluster computing offered more centralized resource pool , while grid computing remaind in need via hardware and computation cycles offerings to the scientific community .",
    "grid computing models observed a deadlock after the introduction of cloud computing concepts .",
    "this situation was a result of missing economic business models , although some work was done on this issue even by the authors   @xcite .",
    "based on pay - as - you - use criteria , cloud computing is still in early stage . however , the economic component of cloud computing is a central focus of actual research  @xcite .",
    "research efforts are going on to establish the basis of cloud computing as every - thing - as - a - service paradigm .",
    "infrastructure providing resources as a utility must be dynamic , scalable and reliable .",
    "orchestration of resources across the globe , named as virtual organization ( vo)/virtual enterprize ( ve ) has been extensively deployed to achieve this target .",
    "change in the hardware and software technology , computing paradigms algorithm and procedures , incorporation of knowledge rather information and data , made the concepts of vo vague .",
    "though vo had been created utilizing the best technology known to that time , but the success was short lived .",
    "there are three main issues , which has to be considered in order to understand :    *   advancement in hardware / software technology .",
    "*   birth of new computing paradigms . *   changed nature of resources and requirements from end user .",
    "we are living in the age of transformation .",
    "a paradigm shift is one that effects the society as a whole . according to peter drucker such transformation place over fifty to sixty - year periods @xcite . in his book `` post - capitalist society '' , he outlines three earlier periods of dramatic changes in the western world .    *",
    "the rise of medieval craft guilds and urban centuries . long distance trade ( thirteenth - century europe ) @xcite . * the renaissance period of gutenburg s printing press and lutheran reformation ( 1455 - 1519 ) @xcite . * the industrial revolution , starting with watt s steam engine ( 1776 - 1815 ) @xcite .",
    "existing technologies and paradigms do not vanish with the birth of new concepts rather they adopt what is positive and remove what is not required .",
    "technology and paradigm used to form vo have also faced this transformation .",
    "for example networking , distributed computing , cluster computing , grid computing , utility computing and now cloud computing , all are related and are improvements of the existing concepts .",
    "when technology changes or improves , paradigm needs an upgrade too .",
    "new methods and algorithms are created to support the hardware .",
    "another main factor is the requirements from the user community .",
    "the user community puts a demand on the technology and computing paradigm and they evolve accordingly .",
    "`` resources / services as a utility '' is main theme of collaboration . to achieve the goal(s ) , organizations and individuals gather all the resources available .",
    "the spectrum of availability has covered the whole globe . today , time and space are not a limit due to information and communication technology ( ict ) advancements .",
    "this revolution has an impact on the resources types .",
    "initial collaborations offered only storage and downloading ( p2p networks ) , computing cycles and storage space ( grid computing and cluster computing ) .",
    "main focus remained at hardware and software sharing , but vos for scientific research initiated another requirement , i.e. need of a human expert to guide the beginners in the said domain .",
    "expert becomes an integral part of collaborations . also , the two way contribution ( duplex ) motivated us to review and categorize the resource in the vicinity of vo .",
    "the categorization we presented is also vigilant to depict the general pattern of resources in any domain .",
    "vo is the right place for both technology and computing paradigm to merge and achieve the objectives . in the past two decades",
    "collaborative computing has remained main concern of technology produced .",
    "optimization of time and heterogeneous resources by building vo is the key point of today s research directions .",
    "vision of a vo has evolved with the networking and distributed computing concepts .",
    "research community recognizes vo with different names , e.g. collaboratories @xcite @xcite , e - science or e - research @xcite @xcite , distributed work groups or virtual teams @xcite @xcite , virtual environments , virtual enterprize @xcite and online communities @xcite @xcite .",
    "initially , focus was to improve business by utilizing the ability to gather resources which are scattered across the dimensions of time , space and structure . with the advent of modern technology",
    ", vo has encompassed almost all fields of life .",
    "we can say that every human will be soon part of a vo .",
    "vo s concepts need to be revisited with this evolution in general .",
    "vos have been visioned from the business perspective in early 1990s .",
    "pervasiveness of technology and improvements in computing paradigms has extended the domain of vo to cover all the areas where individuals and organizations meet to achieve some goal ( formal virtual organization ) or without any specific common objective , e.g. social networks ( informal vo ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "till now there are no standard procedures or patterns for how vo should be created and evolve to accommodate the changes in its integral parts or entities .",
    "lack of standards for vo motivated us to provide a standard vision of e - collaboration incorporating both paradigm and technology shift as a reference architecture ( ra ) to achieve common objective(s ) in any domain .",
    "our research efforts also introduced new concepts regarding resources and stakeholder of a vo .    to provide a standard for vo , we consider the existing technologies and paradigms .",
    "service oriented architecture ( soa ) , web 2.0 and web 3.0 are the underlying technological platform , and computing paradigms include utility computing and cloud computing .    during our research process",
    "we studied the existing infrastructures available for vo . utilizing electronic collaborations for achieving common goals",
    "is a tradition rather a requirement .",
    "distributed resources are gathered using an infrastructure and are exploited to obtain the said results . in it world such collaboration",
    "is known as vo .",
    "idea is to provide resources as a utility to the end user .",
    "service - oriented infrastructures need to act dynamically to fulfil the demands from organizations and businesses .",
    "we encountered the following addressable issues :    * does existing electronic collaboration approaches follow a standard ? * can we define patterns without predefined standards ? * does existing infrastructures fulfil the requirements of participating entities ? *",
    "are the existing infrastructures dynamic and adaptable to the rapidly updating it and business world ? * can we design a generic platform to integrate resources from multiple domains using essential and optional parts ?",
    "our research aims to answer these questions .",
    "vo s creation process lacks standards / patterns / methods @xcite .",
    "we analyzed existing vos and the process of their creation through available documentation .",
    "we found the following answers to the above questions :    * currently , there exist no specific standards for building vo or e - collaboration . *",
    "existing infrastructures are modified for specific domain needs and can not be generalized to all the domains . since",
    ", existing technology is used without following any standard for creating a vo , it is hard to foresee incoming demands from the participants .",
    "* we require a generic platform to integrate resources from a single domain or multiple domains . * defining a generic platform on the basis of everything - as - a - service ( xaas)@xcite concept is a solution .",
    "definition of participating components as : * * essential parts * * optional parts    we present the following solutions for these obstacles :    * generalized patterns for building a vo . * defining components of a vo . * providing new definitions and examples of _ resources _ and _ stakeholder _ in different domains and justifying them in real world . * presenting a reference architecture for virtual organization ( ravo ) which can be applied as a starting point for any community ( belonging to a single or multiple domains ) to collaborate .    the layout of the paper is as follows : in the next section [ sec : vo ] we introduce the notion of virtual organization . in section [ sec : creatingvo ]",
    "we present the principal steps for building a virtual organization , which we map to the process of our blueprint design .",
    "the generic reference architecture for virtual organizations , which we call ravo , is laid out in section [ sec : ravo ] . for justification of our approach a proof - of - concept implementation based on ravo is presented in section [ sec : n2sky ] .",
    "finally the paper is closed with a conclusion of the findings .",
    "a virtual organization is a non - physical communication model with the purpose is of a common goal .",
    "it is built up from people and organizations with respect to geographical limits and nature .",
    "additionally , a virtual organization provides typically a collection of logical and physical resources distributed across the globe . from a conceptual point of view a _ virtual organization _ resembles a detailed non - physical problems solving environment .",
    "many definitions have been presented and many different terms arose , e.g. collaboratories @xcite , e - science or e - research @xcite , distributed work groups or virtual teams @xcite , virtual environments , and online communities @xcite .",
    "a virtual organization can comprise a group of individuals whose members and resources may be dispersed geographically and institutionally , yet who function as a coherent unit through the use of a cyber infrastructure @xcite .",
    "virtual organizations are typically enabled by and provide shared and , in most cases , real - time access to centralized or distributed resources , such as community specific tools , applications , data , instruments , and experimental operations , which was a key research areas of the authors  @xcite in the past .",
    "the different types of virtual organizations depend upon mode of operation , goals they achieve and life span for which they exists .",
    "regardless of the objectives , virtual organizations possess some common characteristics .",
    "virtual organizations provide distributed access across space and time .",
    "structures and processes running a virtual organization are dynamic .",
    "email , video conferencing , telepresence , awareness , social computing and group management tools are used to enable collaboration among the participants @xcite .",
    "operational organizations are supported by simulation , database and analytical services . in daily life",
    "we come across many virtual organizations in terms of social networks as well ( e.g. facebook , myspace ) .",
    "it can be phrased that soon every human on this earth will considered to be a part of some virtual organization serving its purpose in the said organization .",
    "generally , a virtual organization provides a global problem solving platform .",
    "it is difficult to specify or restrict the domain for which they are serving .",
    "some advantageous roles played by virtual organizations are facilitator of access ( birn @xcite , lead @xcite , nanohub @xcite ) , cabig@xcite , lhc computing grid , enhancer of problem solving processes ( teragrid @xcite ) and key to competitiveness ( geon @xcite ) .",
    "virtual organizations have served in the field of earthquake engineering ( southern california earthquake center ( scec ) ) , cancer research ( cancer biomedical informatics grid ( cabig ) @xcite ) , climate research ( earth system grid @xcite ) , high - energy physics ( large hadron collider ) , and computer science .",
    "other communities are now forming virtual organizations to study system - level science .",
    "these virtual organizations are addressing problems that are too large and complex for any individual or institution to tackle alone .",
    "it simply is not possible to assemble at a single location all of the expertise required to design a modern accelerator , to understand cancer , or to predict the likelihood of future earthquakes .",
    "virtual organizations allow humanity to tackle previously intractable problems @xcite .",
    "the creation of a virtual organization is time consuming and should be a well planned activity . in this section",
    "we will discuss virtual organization and technology from different perspectives .",
    "both aspects are required to support each other .",
    "technology provides the basic infrastructure for a virtual organization to exist . a virtual organization in turn places demands on information technology and shapes the evolution of technology . for the last decade",
    "the virtual organization is one of the most discussed collaboration environment ; but still no standards exist . from this discussions we assume a step wise approach which is helpful in the creation of virtual organization .",
    "it can be separated in two phases which are detailed below .",
    "the definition of a virtual organization starts with a series of questions , which are very critical in order to proceed .",
    "these questions ( qx ) are listed in the following :    * q1 : why to form a virtual organization ?",
    "what are the reasons of an organization to create a virtual organization ?",
    "* q2 : what is the motivation behind participation ? why should other persons , institutes , service providers , etc",
    ". want to participate in a virtual organization ?",
    "* q3 : what services are offered by a virtual organization ? * q4 : how are these services fared ? what is the type of the resources / business model ?",
    "* q5 : who are the intended users ? who will eventually use and get benefited from this virtual organization ? * q6 : what is the life of ( membership of ) a virtual organization ?",
    "are temporal alliance or permanent participation expected ?",
    "based on these q&a activity it is necessary to identify the building blocks of a virtual organization .",
    "gannon @xcite has identified main components of a virtual organization .",
    "these components are    * _ common interest . _ the reason to form a virtual organization , * _ users . _ the participants of a virtual organization , * _ tools and services .",
    "_ this is a crucial part of a virtual organization , which maintains the overall working environment and saves the existing patterns to be reused in order to reduce time to solve similar problems .",
    "a virtual organization requires a collection of shared analysis tools ( e.g. visualization tools and provenance tools ) .",
    "tools can be integrated into specific virtual organization work flows and can be shared and reused .",
    "they are used to collect data and publish results . * _ data . _",
    "a virtual organization contains two types of data , generally categorized as meta data and operational data that is being operated by tools .",
    "the component identification process provides the basic building blocks .",
    "the designer of a virtual organization can decide what to be improved and further included in the design process .",
    "also , each component can be given a unique definition by the designer in context of a virtual organization being created .",
    "detailed information about creation , management and application area of virtual organizations is available in @xcite .",
    "according to gerrit muller @xcite there are two simultaneous trends ,    * increasing complexity , scope and size of the system of interest , its context and the organizations creating system @xcite . *",
    "increasing dynamics and integration : shorter time market , more interoperability , rapid changes and adaption in the field , in a highly competitive market , for example cost and performance pressure @xcite .",
    "these trends form basis for our proposed ra as well .",
    "vos are developed as distributed system at multiple locations , by multiple entities , consisting of multiple applications by multiple vendors , merging multiple domains for providing solutions to multiple problems .",
    "ra comes in scene where the multiplicity reaches a critical mass triggering a need to facilitate product creation and life cycle support in this distributed open world @xcite .",
    "we detail the ravo in the subsequent sections .",
    "we define ravo as `` an open source template that does not only depict the architectural patterns and terminology , but also defines the boundaries where heterogeneous resources from different domains merge collaboratively into a common framework '' .",
    "a ra has a life span and is dependent on the target architecture and possibly other ras . as guideline for our effort",
    "we closely analyzed the ra presented by shaman ( european commission , ict-216736 ) , gerrit muller @xcite and nexof@xcite .",
    "ravo provides    * a common lexicon and taxonomy . * a common ( architectural ) vision .",
    "* modularization and complementary context . * a layered approach(bottom - up ) .",
    "a common vision facilitates the participating entities to work as a team to achieve their decided goals .",
    "modularization helps to integrate different domains thereby decreasing the efforts and context information make the dynamic nature of the architecture consistent .",
    "we aim for developing a ra which allows for new forms of it infrastructure coping with new collaborative processing paradigms , as grid computing and cloud computing .",
    "thus we have to deliver an environment to allow for the new _ internet of services and things _ accommodating the novel service stack , as iaas , paas and saas .",
    "architecture is classified into different layers according to the service each layer provides .",
    "layered architecture is chosen because it helps to group different components ( logical and physical ) according to the degree of relatedness and required functionality .",
    "ravo is based on spi model .",
    "layered approach is used to achieve the goal of providing all the resources as a service .",
    "layers are distributed into 3 broad categories , iaas , paas , saas    figure [ fig : csvo ] presents the framework for vo using the spi model .",
    "the layers are distributed into 3 broad categories , iaas , paas and saas thus resulting in xaas .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in context of ravo , saas is composed of a service layer .",
    "it contains domain specific applications ( dsa ) accessible by all users .",
    "dsas are the combination of several user interfaces and business models found in the vo layer .",
    "users , who only use the platform to solve their domain specific problems and do not contribute to the vo , find an entry point at this layer .",
    "* _ service layer _ : it has open source , downloadable software , categorized in domains .",
    "the service layer packages several services provided by the vo layer to be subscribable entities .",
    "these entities include generic functionality to query information from the problem domain as well as the means to perform data mining on the compound data created or provided by the combination of the services .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in ravo two layers , namely vo layer and abstract layer , cover paas .    * _ abstract layer _ : this layer is composed of essential tools which enable the whole framework to be exploited in a dynamic manner .",
    "the set of tools consist of provenance , workflow , graphical tools and any other domain specific tools which are used to enhance the reuse of the resources for a diverse set of problem solving activity .",
    "each tool provides its own functionality , its own user interface description @xcite , as well as an abstract api ( identical for each tool ) to access the resource in factory layer . *",
    "_ vo layer _ : this layer is the entry point for user .",
    "it provides the realization of the user interface description and defines a business model on top of the abstract layer to set usage cost according to usage statistics .",
    "participating entities can agree on a usage model and build a cost trust for selling their resources . in context of vo ,",
    "contributor / subject users ( who not only use the resources offered by a vo but also contribute to the vo ) are authorized to access the system on this layer .",
    "all have access to the system on paas layer .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in ravo logical and physical resources are considered to be the part of iaas .",
    "this part consists of two sub - layers in ravo : factory layer and infrastructure enabler layer .",
    "only users with administrative rights have access to this layer .    * _ factory layer _ :",
    "belongs to the iaas category and contains resources for ravo .",
    "resources are described as physical and logical resources .",
    "physical resources comprise of hardware devices for storage and computation cycles in a distributed manner .",
    "logical resources contain expert s knowledge that supports the problem solution activity thereby reducing time to reach the specified goal . * _ infrastructure enabler layer _ : allows access to the resources provided by the factory layer .",
    "it consists of protocols , procedures and methods to contact the desired resources for a problem solving activity .",
    "it acts as a glue or medium to reach the desired resources based on user request .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    all layers are providing their functionality in a pure service - oriented manner so we can say that ravo is xaas .",
    "vos is a broad category of distributed systems .",
    "it is envisioned as a combined effort of multiple entities ( organizations , people , hw , sw ) for achieving a goal .",
    "building ra for vo is effective in many ways .",
    "ravo forms basis for vos belonging to any domain .",
    "it improves the effectiveness by managing synergy , providing guidance for collaboration , generic framework , managing and sharing the architectural patterns .",
    "interoperability is the most critical aspect of collaborative computing and vos main feature .",
    "it determines the usability , performance and dependability of user level applications @xcite .",
    "integration cost and time are also important factors in context of interoperability .",
    "ravo supports interoperability by defining a negotiation model / trust for the participating entities thereby supporting the effective re - use of patterns .",
    "many ra focuses the technical architecture only .",
    "according to saf meeting conclusion , a ra should address @xcite ,    * technical architecture .",
    "* business architecture .",
    "* customer context .",
    "ravo well addresses these three aspects .",
    "it presents a technical architecture specifying the must participating modules , apis , protocols and platform to support vo .",
    "ravo offers a business model which is open according to the participating entities conditions for resource sharing .",
    "business model and customer context overlap .",
    "ravo explicitly defines roles of participating entities as _ subject _ , _ consumer _ , _ producer _ and _ administrators_. elaboration of roles makes it easy to dynamically update the business model as an entity changes the role .",
    "ravo supports feedback from the participating entities which is helpful in improving and maintaining the existing ra .",
    "these concepts are already detailed in ravo section .",
    "ra is a perceived image of existing technologies .",
    "designing ra is a challenging job because it needs sufficient proof to justify its need in the said context .",
    "ravo focuses on vos . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no standard pattern or framework which can be used to create a vo from scratch .",
    "our vision is to provide the vo community a complete framework for identifying main components and abstract a life cycle to create vo from scratch .",
    "it grasps knowledge from existing structures such as nexof @xcite and shamans ( european commission , ict-216736 ) .",
    "guidelines are used to modify the requirements into an ra which supports creation , dynamic evolution and maintenance of a vo .",
    "viewpoint is defined as a specification of the conventions for constructing and using a view . a pattern or template from which to develop individual views by establishing the purposes and audience for a view and the techniques for its creation and analysis @xcite .",
    "view is a representation or description of the entire system from a single perspective .",
    "stakeholder is the viewer , who perceives the system according to her role .",
    "viewpoint has a name , stakeholders addressed by it and concerns to be addressed by the viewpoint , and the language , modeling techniques or analytical methods to be used in constructing a view based on the viewpoint @xcite . according to these definitions , viewpoints extracted from the concerns of the stakeholders are shown in figure [ fig : vp ] .",
    "these viewpoints are detailed in the following sections .",
    "stakeholders collaborate to form a vo .",
    "all participants of a vo have an objective ( personal or organizational ) to achieve via this collaboration .",
    "sub - viewpoints are ,    * domain definition : depends on the type of problem solution , target domain can be one or multiple .",
    "thus , stakeholders can be from one or multiple domains .",
    "* participation level : participation can be individual or at organizational . * duration : stakeholder remain part of the vo according to the membership duration agreed upon among the collaborative entities .",
    "it can vary depending on the type of vo , partial or permanent ( either participation is required for a specific part or throughout ) and a business model in case of profitable organizations . * types of contribution : it is decided by the role assigned to a specific stakeholder in the context of a vo .      this viewpoint formulates the boundaries of a vo and its participants .",
    "all the participants must clearly put their requirement and goals while building collaboration .",
    "these requirements should reflect any assumption made on the architecture and the respective requirements stemming from the assumptions .",
    "once requirements are defined ( in form of a list , catalogue ) , vo has a vision to achieve and targets are set accordingly .",
    "trust governance viewpoint is very important to any collaboration specially for vos .",
    "keeping stakeholders and resources glued together to achieve a target is only achievable via strong trust .",
    "following sub - viewpoints are defined in this context :    * trust / policy formation : experts and planners from participating entities prepare an agreed upon policy / model / contract .",
    "this policy defines the rules for participating and leaving vo , contributing and consuming resources , penalties for violation and measures to keep consistent and just to all the stakeholders .",
    "* objective catalogue : this viewpoint provides the list of all the contracts and agreements in a documented form necessary for authentication , authorization and stakeholder management . * reviewing policy : due to dynamic nature of vo , the policies and contracts are reviewed to be in the accordance of change in requirements , technological updates , removal and entrance of participants .",
    "* business perspective : this viewpoint is optional depending upon the type of vo .",
