    "the search for an appropriate nuclear equation of state has been an area of considerable research interest because of its wide and far reaching relevance in heavy ion collision experiments and nuclear astrophysics . in particular , the studies in two obvious limits , namely , the symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) and the pure neutron matter ( pnm ) have helped constrain several properties of nuclear matter such as binding energy per nucleon , compressibility modulus , symmetry energy and its density dependence at nuclear saturation density @xmath3  @xcite to varying degrees of success . of late , the avaliability of flow data from heavy ion collision experiments and phenomenological data from observation of compact stars have renewed the efforts to further constrain these properties and to explore their density and isospin content ( asymmetry ) variation behaviours @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental concerns in the construction of nuclear equation of state is the parametrization of the nucleon - nucleon (",
    "n - n ) interaction .",
    "different approaches have been developed to address this problem .",
    "these methods can be broadly classified into three general types  @xcite , namely , the _ ab initio _ methods , the effective field theory approaches and calculations based on phenomenological density functionals .",
    "the _ ab initio _ methods include the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite approach , the ( relativistic ) dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) @xcite calculations , the green function monte - carlo ( gfmc ) @xcite method using the basic n - n interactions given by boson exchange potentials .",
    "the other approach of this type , also known as the variational approach , is pioneered by the argonne group @xcite .",
    "this method is also based on basic two - body ( n - n ) interactions in a non - relativistic formalism with relativistic effects introduced successively at later stages . the effective field theory ( eft )",
    "approaches are based on density functional theories @xcite like chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these calculations involve a few density dependent model parameters evaluated iteratively .",
    "the third type of approach , namely , the calculations based on phenomenological density functionals include models with effective density dependent interactions such as gogny or skyrme forces  @xcite and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of these models are evaluated by carefully fitting the bulk properties of nuclear matter and properties of closed shell nuclei to experimental values .",
    "our work presented here belongs to this class of approaches in the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "the rmf models represent the n - n interactions through the coupling of nucleons with isoscalar scalar @xmath4 mesons , isoscalar vector @xmath1 mesons , isovector vector @xmath2 mesons and the photon quanta besides the self- and cross - interactions among these mesons  @xcite .",
    "nuclear equations of state have also been constructed using the quark meson coupling model ( qmc ) @xcite where baryons are described as systems of non - overlapping mit bags which interact through effective scalar and vector mean fields , very much in the same way as in the rmf model .",
    "the qmc model has also been applied to study the asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "it has been shown earlier  @xcite , that the medium and long range attraction effect simulted by the @xmath4 mesons in rmf theory can also be produced by the @xmath0-wave pion pairs .",
    "this `` dressing '' of nucleons by pion pairs has also been applied to study the properties of deuteron@xcite and @xmath5he @xcite . on this basis , we start with a nonrelativistic hamiltonian density with @xmath6 interaction . the @xmath7repulsion and the isospin asymmetry part of the nn interaction",
    "are parametrized by two additional terms representing the coupling of nucleons with the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 mesons respectively .",
    "the parameters of these interactions are then evaluated self - consistently by using the saturation properties like binding energy per nucleon , pressure , compressibility and the symmetry energy .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter is subsequently calculated and compared with the results of other independent approaches available in current literature .",
    "the eos of pure neutron matter is also used to calculate the mass and radius of a neutron star .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in section  ii , we present the theoretical formalism of the asymmetric nuclear matter as outlined above . the results are presented and discussed in section iii . finally , in the last section the concluding remarks are drawn indicating the future outlook of the model .",
    "we start with the effective pion nucleon hamiltonian @xmath8 where the free nucleon part @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 the free meson part @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12,\\label{e4}\\ ] ] and the @xmath6 interaction  @xcite is provided by @xmath13\\psi(\\mathbf x).\\label{e5}\\ ] ] in equations ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) , @xmath14 represents the non - relativistic two component spin - isospin quartet nucleon field . the single particle nucleon energy operator @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 with nucleon mass @xmath17 and the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath18 .",
    "the isospin triplet pion fields of mass @xmath19 are represented by @xmath20 .",
    "we expand the pion field operator @xmath21 in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of off - mass shell pions satisfying equal time algebra as @xmath22 with energy @xmath23 in the perturbative basis .",
    "we continue to use the perturbative basis , but note that since we take an arbitrary number of pions in the unitary transformation @xmath24 in equation ( [ e8 ] ) as given later , the results would be nonperturbative . the expectation value of the first term of @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) vanishes and the pion pair of the second term provides the isoscalar scalar interaction of nucleons thereby simulating the effects of @xmath4-mesons . a pion - pair creation operator given as @xmath26 is then constructed in momentum space with the ansatz function @xmath27 to be determined later .",
    "we then define the unitary transformation @xmath24 as @xmath28 and note that @xmath24 , operating on vacuum , creates an arbitrarily large number of scalar isospin singlet pairs of pions .",
    "the `` pion dressing '' of nuclear matter is then introduced through the state @xmath29 where @xmath24 constitutes a bogoliubov transformtion given by @xmath30    we then proceed to calculate the energy expectation values .",
    "we consider @xmath31 nucleons occupying a spherical volume of radius @xmath32 such that the density @xmath33 remains constant as @xmath34 and we ignore the surface effects .",
    "we describe the system with a density operator @xmath35 such that its matrix elements are given by  @xcite @xmath36 , \\label{e13}\\ ] ] and @xmath37=\\int \\rho _ { \\alpha \\alpha } ( \\mathbf x , \\mathbf x ) d\\mathbf x = n=\\rho v.\\label{e14}\\ ] ] we obtain the free nucleon energy density @xmath38|f\\rangle = \\sum_{\\tau = n , p } { \\gamma { k^\\tau_f}^3 \\over 6\\pi^2 } \\left ( m+{3\\over 10}{k_f^{\\tau 2}\\over m}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{e15}\\ ] ] in the above equation , the spin degeneracy factor @xmath39  =  2 , the index @xmath40 runs over the isospin degrees of freedom @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 represents the fermi momenta of the nucleons . for asymmetric nuclear matter , we define the neutron and proton densities @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively over the same spherical volume such that the nucleon density @xmath46",
    ". the fermi momenta @xmath43 are related to neutron and proton densities by the relation @xmath47 .",
    "we also define the asymmetry parameter @xmath48 .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath49 for @xmath50 respectively .    using the operator expansion of equation  ( [ e6 ] ) , the free pion part of the hamiltonian as given in equation  ( [ e4 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath51 the free pion kinetic energy density is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "using @xmath54 in the nonrelativistic limit , the interaction energy density @xmath55 can be written from equation ( [ e5 ] ) as @xmath56|f \\rangle \\simeq { g^2\\rho\\over 2 m } \\langle f|:\\varphi_i(\\mathbf x)\\varphi_i(\\mathbf x ) :    \\label{e18}\\ ] ] using the equations  ( [ e8 ] ) , ( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) , we have from equation ( [ e18 ] ) @xmath57 the pion field dependent energy density terms add up to give @xmath58 which is to be optimized with respect to the ansatz function @xmath59 for its evaluation",
    ". however , this ansatz function yields a divergent value for @xmath60 .",
    "this happens because we have taken the pions to be point like and have assumed that they can approach as near each other as they like , which is physically inaccurate .",
    "therefore , we introduce a phenomenological repulsion energy between the pions of a pair given by @xmath61 where the two parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 correspond to the strength and length scale , repectively , of the repulsion and are to be determined self - consistently later .",
    "thus the pion field dependent term of the total energy density becomes @xmath64 .",
    "then the optimization of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath65 yields @xmath66 the expectation value of the pion field dependent parts of the total hamiltonian density of eqn .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) alongwith the modification introduced by the phenomenological term @xmath67 becomes @xmath68 \\label{e24}\\ ] ] . with the integrals @xmath69 ( @xmath50 ) given by @xmath70 \\label{e25}\\ ] ] and @xmath71 .",
    "we now introduce the energy of @xmath1 repulsion by the simple form @xmath72 where the parameter @xmath73 corresponds to the strength of the interaction at constant density and is to be evaluated later .",
    "we note that equation  ( [ e26 ] ) can arise from a hamiltonian density given in terms of a local potential @xmath74 as @xmath75 where , when density is constant , we in fact have @xmath76    the isospin dependent interaction is mediated by the isovector vector @xmath2 mesons .",
    "we represent the contribution due to this interaction , in a manner similar to the @xmath1-meson energy , by the term @xmath77 where @xmath78 and the strength parameter @xmath79is to be determined as described later .",
    "thus we finally write down the binding energy per nucleon @xmath80 of the cold asymmetric nuclear matter : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the energy density .",
    "the expression for @xmath83 contains the four model parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath84  and @xmath79  as introduced above .",
    "these parameters are then determined self - consistently through the saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the pressure @xmath85 , compressibility modulus @xmath86 and the symmetry energy @xmath87 are given by the standard relations : @xmath88 the effective mass @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 with @xmath91",

    "it is well - known that the walecka model yields a very high compressibility @xmath86 .",
