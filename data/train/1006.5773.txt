    "the hunt for the higgs boson to uncover its role in electroweak symmetry breaking is now being undertaken at both the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron have recently announced a 95% exclusion limit on a sm higgs boson with a mass in the range 162 gev @xmath1 166 gev  @xcite .",
    "this search requires precise theoretical predictions for the cross section for higgs production .",
    "the dominant hadronic production mechanism , gluon fusion through a top - quark loop , is known exactly through next - to - leading order in perturbative qcd  @xcite . in the effective theory with @xmath2 , both the nlo corrections  @xcite and the nnlo corrections",
    "are known  @xcite .",
    "when normalized to the full @xmath3-dependent leading - order result , this effective theory reproduces the exact nlo result to better than 1% for @xmath4 and to 10% or better for higgs boson masses up to 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections drastically alter the higgs production cross section prediction ; for example , the gluon fusion cross section is increased by roughly a factor of three above the lo prediction at the tevatron after the nnlo corrections are included . only at nnlo",
    "is an accurate prediction free from debilitating uncertainties obtained .",
    "after inclusion of the nnlo corrections , the remaining uncertainty form uncalculated higher - order terms is estimated to be roughly @xmath5 .",
    "updated cross sections for higgs production in gluon fusion for use at the tevatron and lhc are available in refs .  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the status of theoretical predictions for higgs boson production in the sm , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the properties of the higgs boson can be modified in theories with additional particles , and measurement of these properties consequently serves as a window into physics beyond the sm . as an example of such a standard model extension , we consider new particles transforming in the adjoint representation under the color gauge group .",
    "several interesting extensions of the sm introduce such states .",
    "scalars in the @xmath6 representation can arise in theories with universal extra dimensions  @xcite . the primary decay for such states is expected to be into either @xmath7 or @xmath8 , depending on the scalar mass and other model parameters .",
    "the tevatron experiments can search for these states via pair production of @xmath6 scalars , leading to a four @xmath9-jet final state .",
    "the search reach in the scalar mass was recently estimated to be 280 gev  @xcite .",
    "the direct search for these scalars is rendered difficult by the large qcd background .",
    "reduction of the background requires significant cuts that reduce the signal and therefore the search reach .",
    "it is possible that indirect searches for these scalars , such as via their influence on the higgs production cross section , can probe masses competitive with direct searches .",
    "we summarize here our recent calculation of the nnlo corrections to the higgs boson production cross section in models with a @xmath6 scalar  @xcite . to be as independent as possible from the origin of this scalar",
    ", we study a simple model that couples this scalar to both qcd and the higgs doublet via renormalizable operators .",
    "we utilize the effective - theory approach valid when both the sm top quark and the new scalar are heavier than the higgs boson . as a byproduct of our computation , we derive all renormalization constants needed to study higher - order corrections in models with these scalars .",
    "we use the renormalization - group equations governing the evolution of the scalar - sector couplings to determine the likely ranges of the various parameters which appear .",
    "we also study the phenomenological implications of the color - octet scalar for the higgs production cross section at both the tevatron and the lhc . only at nnlo",
    "is the scale dependence sufficiently reduced to allow precise predictions for the scalar - induced effects to be obtained .",
    "the deviations from the standard model prediction for higgs production are large at both colliders .",
    "deviations of a factor of two , much larger than the estimated uncertainties from higher - order corrections and parton distribution function errors , are obtained for scalar masses near the estimated direct search reach of @xmath10 gev .",
    "we begin with the following lagrangian , which describes the standard model coupled to a color - octet scalar in the @xmath6 representation : @xmath11             - m_s^{'2 } \\,{tr } \\left [ s^2 \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\          & & - g_s^2 \\,g_{4s } \\,{tr } \\left [ s^2 \\right]^2-   \\lambda_1 h^{\\dagger}h \\,{tr } \\left [ s^2 \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\          & & -\\lambda_h \\left(h^{\\dagger}h - \\frac{v^2}{2}\\right)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 denotes the matrix - valued scalar field @xmath13 , @xmath14 indicates the higgs doublet before electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath15 is the higgs vacuum - expectation value , and @xmath16 is the covariant derivative for adjoint fields . the higgs quartic coupling has been explicitly included to define its normalization .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs doublet is expanded as @xmath17 in the unitary gauge .",
    "the mass of the color - octet scalar becomes @xmath18 .",
    "the feynman rules which describe the scalar couplings to the higgs boson @xmath19 and to gluons are easily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfull ] ) . the free parameters which govern the scalar properties are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we note that higher - order operators which break the @xmath23 symmetry present above and which allow the scalar to decay are obtained in explicit models which contain this state  @xcite .",
    "we neglect them here since we anticipate that they have little effect on the @xmath24 production cross section .",
    "we comment on the appearance of the @xmath25 ^ 2 $ ] term in the scalar potential .",
    "a quartic - scalar coupling is generated by qcd interactions even if it is set to zero at tree - level . at nnlo the quartic coupling",
    "must be included to obtain a renormalizable result .",
    "we include this operator in the tree - level lagrangian with a coefficient scaled by @xmath26 , the qcd coupling constant squared , to permit an easier power - counting of loops .",
    "we sketch here our derivation of the effective lagrangian describing the interaction of the higgs boson with gluons through nnlo in the qcd coupling constant .",
    "when both the adjoint scalar and the top quark are heavier than the higgs boson , they can be integrated out to derive the following effective lagrangian : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a wilson coefficient and the operator @xmath29 is @xmath30 the effective lagrangian for the gluons and light quarks , @xmath31 , has the same form as @xmath32 except that the fields and parameters it contains are rescaled by decoupling constants that account for the effects of the heavy states . in order to distinguish the fields and parameters occurring in the full lagrangian from those in the effective lagrangian , we denote the latter ones with a prime . in this manuscript",
    "we integrate out the top quark and the color - octet scalar in a single step .",
    "our calculation is therefore a two - scale problem .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the example diagrams contributing to the nnlo wilson coefficient shown in fig .",
    "[ twoscale ] .",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath28 can be constructed by computing the amplitude for @xmath24 in the limit that the initial gluon momenta vanish , as reviewed in ref .",

    "here , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the momenta of the two gluons , @xmath38 is the number of colours , and @xmath39 is the dimension of space - time .",
    "the factor @xmath40 is the bare decoupling coefficient by which the bare gluon fields in the full and effective theories are related : @xmath41 it can be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the transverse part of the bare gluon self - energy in the full theory . in order to obtain the wilson coefficient through nnlo in the qcd coupling constant ,",
    "@xmath44 is needed up to three loops , while @xmath45 is needed through two loops .",
    "we can set all scaleless integrals to zero in dimensional regularization , and as a result , only diagrams containing at least one massive scalar propagator contribute to @xmath45 and to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : c01 ] ) .",
    "we perform our calculations in a covariant gauge with gauge parameter @xmath46 , leading to the following gluon propagator : @xmath47 in all diagrams , terms up to first order in @xmath46 are retained .",
    "all @xmath46-dependent terms cancel in @xmath45 up to two - loop order , and in @xmath44 up to three - loop order , providing a strong calculational check on the result for @xmath34 .",
    "we now outline the steps involved in deriving the wilson coefficient describing the color - octet interactions with the higgs boson .",
    "initially , all quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c01 ] ) are expressed in terms of the bare masses @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the bare coupling constants @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we renormalize the scalae and top - quark masses in the @xmath52 scheme according to @xmath53 the explicit expressions for these renormalization constants , and all others , can be found in ref .",
    "the quartic coupling first appears in the @xmath24 amplitude at the two - loop level , and its renormalization is therefore only required to one loop : @xmath54 we convert the bare strong coupling constant of the full theory into the bare coupling of the effective theory using decoupling constants obtained from the ghost self energy and the ghost - gluon vertex up to two - loops , as described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "we then renormalize it in the effective theory using the @xmath52 scheme : @xmath55 the wilson coefficient itself requires a renormalization factor  @xcite : @xmath56 our final result for the renormalized wilson coefficient is rather lengthy , and can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we now present numerical results for the higgs boson production cross section in gluon fusion , to study the deviations induced by the color - octet scalar .",
    "we include the effects of the top quark , the scalar , and also the bottom quark on the higgs cross section .",
    "we comment first on precisely what terms we include in the cross section .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the terms obtained by squaring together the top and scalar amplitudes , and keeping both the interference term and the pieces from each separate particle squared .",
    "we let @xmath58 denote the interferences between the bottom - quark amplitude with the top and the scalar pieces , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 indicates the contribution from the bottom - quark amplitude squared . for the cross section at the @xmath60-th order in perturbation theory",
    ", we use the following expression : @xmath61 @xmath62 denotes the ratio of the @xmath60-th order cross section over the lo result , with both computed in the effective theory defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff ] ) .",
    "the cross section multiplying the @xmath63-factor is the lo cross section with the exact dependence on the scalar and top - quark masses .",
    "the remaining terms account for the scalar - bottom interference , the top - bottom interference , and the bottom - squared contribution at lo with their exact mass dependences . in the sm ,",
    "the scaling of the exact lo cross section by the eft @xmath63-factor is known to furnish an approximation accurate to the few - percent level or better for higgs masses below roughly 400 gev  @xcite . for the scalar , this approximation has been studied against the exact nlo calculation  @xcite , and is again accurate to the @xmath64% percent level for @xmath65 , which is the region we focus on here .",
    "if desired , the exact nlo corrections to the top - bottom interference and bottom - squared terms  @xcite can be included , as can those to the bottom - scalar interference  @xcite .",
    "these affect the cross section at the @xmath66 level , and for simplicity are neglected .",
    "various electroweak corrections known for the sm contribution  @xcite are not known for the scalar , and for consistency are neglected .",
    "we use the pole mass @xmath67 gev for the top quark  @xcite , while for the bottom quark we use the @xmath52 mass  @xcite .",
    "the choice of pole or @xmath52 mass for the @xmath9-quark has an insignificant effect on the fractional deviation between the scalar - induced cross section and the sm result .",
