    "foot arches are the result of the successive evolution of basic human activities such as walking  @xcite . among the vertebrates , only humans have foot arches  @xcite .",
    "the anatomic structure of one transverse , one medial longitudinal and one lateral longitudinal arch can perform the functions of buffering , amortizing , stabilizing and generating propulsion in human activities  @xcite .",
    "research into the shape , structure , and function of the foot arch has never ceased .",
    "differences exist in the shape and structure of each individual s foot arches , which is related to factors such as age and weight  @xcite .",
    "the usual methods to collect the foot arch shape include footprinting , x - ray , plantar pressure measurement , laser scanning measurement and mri scanning  @xcite .",
    "using indices such as the footprint ratio and foot arch index , we can divide the foot shape into three categories : normal , high - arched and flat .",
    "the morphological flat and high - arched foot are asymptomatic .",
    "some research results demonstrate that the non - pathological flatfoot ( flexible flatfoot ) does not affect one s physiology or quality of life and therefore does not require therapy  @xcite .",
    "others indicate that the flat foot exerts effects on velocity , stamina and/or balance  @xcite while those possessing the high - arched foot are unsuitable sprint athletes  @xcite .",
    "what difference exists in the gaits of people with the non - pathological flat foot and high - arched foot ? will this difference exert an effect upon walking ?",
    "if so , how ?",
    "as yet no satisfactory answers have been provided to these questions .",
    "shape is a representation of structure .",
    "a 3d foot scanner can be used to record the footprint of a person while standing . according to footprint ratio  @xcite , flat - footed or high - arched subjects can be selected .",
    "structure affects function .",
    "the distribution of plantar pressure can qualitatively reflect such information as the structure and function of the foot as well as the control of the whole body in gait  @xcite .",
    "system gait analysis has been used to measure the natural gaits of both groups of subject .",
    "differences in gait between these two groups have been detected by analyzing both the distributions of vgrf of foot and the rates of the footprint areas .",
    "this study was approved by the science and ethics committee of our institute . before the experiments ,",
    "the subjects were informed of the objectives , requirements and procedures of the experiments . all",

    ", we examined the prospective subjects with help from the orthopedics department of our clinic to screen and exclude subjects with pathological flat foot or high - arched foot symptoms such as talipes calcaneovalgus , congenital talipes equinovarus ( ctev ) ( club foot ) , or planter flexion anomaly .",
    "the subjects were asked to stand barefooted after both feet had been sterilized with @xmath1 ethyl alcohol , and their footprints of half weight were captured with a 3d laser scanner .",
    "the footprint - ratio method was used to analyze the foot shape . for the inner side of the podogram",

    "this offers important evidence to analyze foot muscle fatigue .",
    "the vgrf distribution of foot can well explain why the flat - footed experience pain more readily when they walk for a long time . the smaller rate of the footprint areas brings greater stability to the high - arched .",
    "the lack of stability suffered by the flat - footed requires more consumption of energy , and thus may well explain the fatigue felt by the flat - footed on long walks .    in summary ,",
    "the mysterious human gait is much more complicated than we had expected .",
    "there exist so many unknown phenomena , which we have not yet been able to discover .",
    "the establishment of a new gait evaluation index could certainly be employed as an important means to disclose the unknown .",
    "the foot arch can not only lessen muscle fatigue , it can also reduce energy consumption  @xcite .",
    "it was the unique foot arch that brought the human being walk out of africa ( so to speak ) .",
    "how to prevent seniors from falling has always been a key issue in the biomechanical research of gait  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these two foot types may equally arouse attention to the gait of flat - footed seniors .",
    "in addition , does the fact that walking can be affected by foot type mean that we can enhance the gait stability for flat - footed seniors by the design of their shoes  @xcite ? in any case , the vgrf distribution of foot and the rate of footprint areas can be employed as important evaluation indices .",

    "<S> there has been a controversy as to whether or not the non - pathological flat foot and high - arched foot have an effect on human walking activities . </S>",
    "<S> the 3d foot scanning system was employed to obtain static footprints from subjects adopting a half - weight - bearing stance . based upon their footprints , </S>",
    "<S> the subjects were divided into two groups : the flat - footed and the high - arched . </S>",
    "<S> the plantar pressure measurement system was used to measure and record the subjects successive natural gaits . </S>",
    "<S> two indices were proposed : distribution of vertical ground reaction force ( vgrf ) of plantar and the rate of the footprint areas . </S>",
    "<S> using these two indices to compare the natural gaits of the two subject groups , we found that ( 1 ) in stance phase , there is a significant difference ( @xmath0 ) in the distributions of vgrf of plantar ; ( 2 ) in a stride cycle , there is also a significant difference ( @xmath0 ) in the rates of the footprint areas . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that when walking , the vgrf of the plantar brings greater muscle tension to the flat - footed while a smaller rate of the footprint areas brings greater stability to the high - arched . </S>"
