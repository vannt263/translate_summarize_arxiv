    "the advantage of 3d offers the possibility of topological protection in carrying out quantum computation , even at higher temperatures than in 2d .",
    "the two models are natural extension from a symmetric model that we considered previously  @xcite , and the asymmetric parameter introduced here can be used study its effect on computational universality , as well as the possibility to tune the system through a quantum phase transition .",
    "they are exactly solvable , and thus also allow us to study and compare with the usual transitions in phases of matter .",
    "the first model has a first - order phase transition only at zero temperature and it does not coincide with the transition in the quantum computational power .",
    "moreover , even though there is no phase transition at any finite temperature , there is a region at finite temperature that supports universal quantum computation .",
    "the second model does not have a phase transition at zero temperature but has a transition in quantum computational power at both zero and finite temperatures .",

    "[ sec : models ] we introduce the two models , which are defined on any trivalent lattices either in two or three dimensions .",
    "we focus on the ground - state properties as well as the phase diagram at finite temperatures . in sec .",

    "we have previously constructed a model hamiltonian whose thermal states can be used for universal mbqc even without turning off the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to take a small unit of a few spins , e.g. , one spin-3/2 @xmath0 at the center coupled to three outer spin-1/2 @xmath1 that interact via the heisenberg interaction @xmath2 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice1 ] .",
    "then we stack up many such units to form a higher dimensional structure , e.g. , the decorated 2d honeycomb or other trivalent lattices , or even 3d lattices , and then `` glue '' or map two smaller spins ( i.e. spin-1/2 particles ) from neighboring units to single larger spin ; see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice1 ] .",
    "each merged spin , which we shall refer to as a bond particle , possesses a hilbert space of dimension @xmath3 ( i.e. two copies of a qubit ) and hence is equivalent to a spin-3/2 entity .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that the ground state and its spectral gap can be readily solved and checked .",
    "as we shall see , the exactly solvable hamiltonians thereby constructed allow for fault - tolerant , universal quantum computation with thermal states , and even with topological protection in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "there was no free parameter in the hamiltonians in ref .",
    "it was not clear whether or not such quantum computational universality only occurred for the specific hamiltonian or could be extended to a region in a phase diagram .",
    "here we use as building blocks two different types of interactions beyond the heisenberg interaction to allow a free system parameter : the xxz interaction @xmath4 and an additional on - site anisotropic term @xmath5 , and investigate relation between the statistical mechanical and quantum computational features of the resultant two- and three - dimensional models as the system parameter and the temperature vary .",
    "( note the upper case @xmath6 is a spin operator for the center particle of larger spin magnitude , where @xmath7 is a spin-1/2 operator , i.e. , ` half ' of the degree of freedom in a bond particle and will be denoted by @xmath8 or @xmath9 later ) .",
    "these interactions might be engineered in cold atoms or trapped ions . )",
    "it turns out to be useful to relate the ground state wavefunctions of the two models if we parameterize @xmath10 by @xmath11 in the first model and thus the heisenberg point is at @xmath12 .",

    ". then measurement on the bond particle ( i.e. , a joint measurement on the two virtual qubits ) can be used to induce a control - z ( cz ) gate between two center particles  @xcite .",
    "the result is a cluster state , a universal resource state . to summarize",
    ", we have thus shown that for @xmath98 , the ground state is universal for mbqc .    for @xmath99",
    ", we need to use a different povm  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath100 one can easily verify the completeness relation @xmath101 , via a direct calculation that yields @xmath102 in this case , the outcome @xmath103 is not desirable , i.e. , it needs to be regarded as an error ( specifically a qubit loss ) as a ghz can not be obtained .",
    "the outcomes from @xmath104 and @xmath105 still yield a perfect ghz state .",
    "to arrive at the same ghz state  ( [ eqn : ghz ] ) as in the case of @xmath106 , we further perform operations @xmath95 and @xmath96 , for outcomes @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . sites with undesirable outcome @xmath103 is equivalent to having leakage out of logical qubit space ( or a qubit loss ) but can be removed without affecting neighboring center sites by performing measurement on the surrounding bond particles so as to disentangle the unit ( the center spin and the three virtual qubits ) from the neighboring ones .",
    "thus the qubit loss rate corresponds to the probability @xmath109 of obtaining a @xmath110 outcome , where @xmath111 if @xmath112 is smaller than the site percolation threshold @xmath113 ( which depends on the lattices , such as honeycomb , cross , and square - octagon ) , then there is not sufficient _ connection _ in the remaining network and thus no two - dimensional graph state can be distilled  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that there is a finite range of @xmath53 below @xmath114 such that the remaining sites still possess enough connection , i.e. , the corresponding graph resides in the supercritical phase of percolation . for universal mbqc",

    "this gives @xmath117 for honeycomb , square - octagon , and cross lattices , respectively .",
    "for the honeycomb lattice , the threshold translates to @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , at zero temperature , there is a transition in the quantum computational power in both models and , in the first model , before the system reaches its phase transition at @xmath119 as @xmath43 decreases .",
    "the exact location of the transition point in the quantum computational power depends on the underlying lattices , due to the connection to percolation .",
    "connection to percolation and quantum computation has been previously explored , such as site percolation in noisy cluster states  @xcite and bond percolation in nondeterministic gates for cluster state preparation  @xcite .",
    "the above analysis shows that for model 1 the transition in the quantum computational power ( at @xmath120 on the honeycomb lattice ) does not coincide with the transition in the phase of matter ( at @xmath119 ) .",
    "moreover , even though model 2 possesses only one phase of matter , the quantum computational universality only exists in part of the phase . in the following",
    "we shall investigate the finite - temperature effect on the quantum computational universality and determine the corresponding ` phase diagram ' in terms of quantum computational capability .",
    "because of the structure that the hamiltonian for both models can be divided into units independent with one another , the free energy at finite temperatures are non - singular , and thus there are no phase transition at finite temperatures .",
    "as we shall see below , the region with universal quantum computational power exists up to certain finite temperatures . for a finite temperature ,",
    "the system is not in the exact ground state but a thermal state .",
    "this means that the production of a ghz state in each unit ( and thus the global cluster state ) is faulty .",
    "therefore , whether the ` phase ' of universal quantum computational power exists depends on how one can deal with errors .",
    "in particular , the ` phase ' boundary will depend on the error rates and the thresholds for fault - tolerant quantum computation ( ftqc ) .",
    "our goal is to establish the existence of a nonzero - temperature region that universal mbqc is possible rather than to pin point the absolute boundary of such a region . in the following we describe in detail the error analysis and how the ` phase diagram ' of the computational power is obtained . for those readers who wish to skip the details , the ` microscopic '",
