    "massive stars ( m @xmath0 8 m@xmath1 ) end their lives as core - collapse supernovae ( cc sne ) .",
    "sne resulting from stars that had lost their h envelopes before they collapse are called stripped - envelope cc sne ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are traditionally classified as type ib if the he envelope was still present and type ic if it had been lost .",
    "stripped - envelope cc - sne show a large variety of observed properties @xcite , depending on the physical parameters of the progenitor stars ( radius , mass , chemical composition , circumstellar environment ) at the time of explosion .",
    "the variety of stripped envelope cc sne became even more evident when in the late 1990 s a few sne ic with extremely broad spectral features were discovered , some of which had also unusually high luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this prompted the introduction of a new subclass , named broad - line sne ic ( sne bl - ic ) .",
    "the broad spectral lines in sne bl - ic suggest high velocities of the expanding ejecta and a large kinetic energy to ejected mass ratio .",
    "recently some objects with yet unprecedented characteristics have been discovered ( e.g. sn2006jc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter",
    "we focus on the early - phase observations of sn2007gr , another type ic stripped - envelope cc sn with interesting properties .",
    "sn2007gr exploded in ngc  1058 @xcite , a member of a group of nearby galaxies .",
    "the distance to ngc 925 , one of the galaxies belonging to the group , was measured as 9.3mpc using cepheid stars @xcite .",
    "we adopted this distance also for ngc 10581.3 mpc ) was used by @xcite in a previous work on sn 2007gr . with this distance",
    "the sn would be 0.28 magnitude brighter than calculated here . ] .",
    "sn2007gr is thus one of the nearest stripped - envelope cc sne ever observed , and a suitable target for progenitor search @xcite .",
    "ngc  1058 is a prolific host of sne : two other cc sne ( 1961v and 1969l ) occurred in the galaxy .",
    "sn2007gr was discovered on 2007 aug 15.51 ut , but was not detected in a kait image taken on aug 10.44 ut ( unfiltered mag @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "this constrains the explosion epoch to @xmath3 5 days before discovery , which by itself makes of sn  2007gr a very interesting event .",
    "based on a spectrum obtained the following night , sn2007gr was classified as a generic sn ib / c since it was not clear whether the line near 6350  was really hei  ( as for sne ib ) @xcite . as described below",
    ", the later spectral evolution did not confirm the presence of he .",
    "sn2007gr is thus to be classified as type ic .",
    "starting the night after the discovery , we observed sn2007gr almost every night until it reached maximum brightness , and then less frequently during the decline phase .",
    "thanks to the good spectral coverage during the rising phase , unprecedented for a type ic sn , the origin of the 6350  feature can be investigated in detail .",
    "this feature is visible in the earliest spectra of several sne ic , sometimes partially blended with a feature near 6150   which is often attributed to siii  feature : nei   @xcite or detached h@xmath4  @xcite . ] .    against the identification of the 6350   feature as",
    "hei@xcite is the fact that while in sne ib the intensity of the helium features typically increases with time @xcite , as is expected because of the increased diffusion of @xmath5-rays @xcite , in sn2007gr the feature decreases and the line even disappears around maximum ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a more likely identification for this line is cii   @xmath66580 at @xmath7kms@xmath8 .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the presence of another line at @xmath9   attributed to cii  @xmath67235 , which also disappears around maximum .",
    "the velocity of cii   is similar to that of the lines of other ions .",
    "the cii   features in sn2007gr show an evolution similar to that seen in sne ia at similar phases @xcite .    at later epochs ,",
    "after the cii features fade , strong ci lines appear in the spectra , in particular in the near infrared , indicating a decrease of the temperature .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( upper panel ) where the optical and infrared spectrum of sn2007gr at two weeks past maximum is compared with synthetic spectra calculated using a monte carlo spectrum synthesis code @xcite .",
    "we assumed a power - law density profile ( @xmath10 ) and a lower boundary `` photospheric '' velocity @xmath11kms@xmath8 , with an ejecta mass above the photosphere of @xmath12 m@xmath1 .",
    "the composition was taken to be homogeneous for all elements and includes @xmath13 o , @xmath14 c , @xmath15 ne , a total of @xmath16 na , mg , si , s , and ca , and about @xmath17 heavy elements ( sc , ti , cr , fe , co , and ni ) .    the model ( dotted line in fig .",
    "2 ) provides a reasonable fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "the absorptions seen in the ir are mostly caused by ci , but the observed line strength is not reproduced . for the density structure used in the models the depth of the ci  features is relatively insensitive to the c mass fraction for mass fractions exceeding @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the simple density structure used here may need improvement , specifically at high velocities to allow more carbon to recombine than predicted by the model .    to show this more clearly , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we also show ( dashed line ) a model where the optical depth in all ci   lines is artificially enhanced at @xmath20kms@xmath8by factors of 20 to 100 at different velocities . the feature at 10,400 , can be explained almost entirely by ci   in this way , except for blue wing that is probably due to other ions ( e.g. mgii , sii   or hei , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in previous analyses of sn  1994i ,",
    "the origin of the @xmath21 absorption was discussed , including the possibility of a contribution of ci  @xcite .",
    "sn  2007gr shows a much stronger signature of this ion than other events , which makes this identification more convincing .    a common alternative identification of this line is hei@xcite",
    "; however , none of the other hei  features that are expected are present in our observed spectrum to a strength sufficiently large to support this identification .",
    "in particular , the hei  line at 20580  should be clearly visible if hei  were the main contributor to the 10400  absorption .",
    "incidentally , among the stripped - envelope cc sne shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , only sn1999ex ( a sn ib ) shows a strong hei  @xmath620587 .",
    "the other sne are all of type ic , and none of them show that feature .",
    "the ci  features are particularly strong in sn2007gr , while they are weaker in sne 1994i and 2004aw and absent in sne 1998bw , 2002ap , and 1999ex .",
    "sn1999ex may have burned most of the progenitor s carbon , since at the early phases it shows quite strong mgii  features @xcite .",
    "mg is one of the elements produced in carbon burning @xcite .",
    "the low c abundance in the bl sn ic 2002ap is confirmed by a study of the near - ir spectra @xcite .",
    "these authors also noted the presence of ci  in the infrared spectrum of the sn ic 2000ew , and the absence of strong ci in the sn ib 2001b .",
    "the emerging evidence calls for a complex scenario .",
    "it is not clear why some sne ib and bl sne ic show weak ( if any ) carbon features , while normal sne ic show a wide range in c / o optical lines . the low carbon abundance in bl sne ic could be due to more massive and/or lower metallicity progenitors @xcite than for standard sne  ic .",
    "however , it is difficult to place sne ib in the same context .",
    "the identification of ci  in the infrared spectra of sn2007gr is facilitated by the fact that the spectral features in this sn are narrower than in other sne ic ( for instance , the feii features at 4924 , 5018 , 5170  are unblended , which is very uncommon for type ic sne ) .",
    "the narrow lines are probably related to the particularly slow evolution of the photospheric expansion velocity of sn2007gr which ranges from 11000kms@xmath8  one week after explosion to 4800kms@xmath8  at @xmath22 days after explosion .",
    "the small range of velocities at which the lines could form makes them narrow compared to other sne ic . by contrast , sn2002ap reaches even lower velocities than sn2007gr at late phases , but it still shows broad features .",
    "this is due to the shallow density gradient and the huge velocity range at which the lines can form in sn2002ap .",
    "in fact , at early phases the velocity derived for sn2002ap is @xmath23kms@xmath8  higher than that obtained for sn2007gr .",
    "no data are available for other stripped - envelope cc sne ic at such an early epoch .",
    "the fact that at @xmath24 days after explosion sn2007gr is still optically thick inside 5000kms@xmath8   and that there is not enough material outside 11000kms@xmath8   to form lines may suggest that sn2007gr is a compact object inside @xmath23kms@xmath8 , with a sharp tail out to 11000kms@xmath8 .",
    "sn2007gr reached maximum on aug 28 at @xmath25 . adopting a distance modulus of 29.84 , a galactic extinction of e(b - v)=0.062 @xcite , and a host galaxy extinction of e(b - v)=0.03 ,",
    "the absolute r magnitude is -17.3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the estimate of the host galaxy extinction is derived from the relative intensity of the galactic and host galaxy interstellar nai  d1 absorption lines , assuming that the galactic and host galaxy dust properties are similar .",
    "equivalent widths of 0.31 and 0.13  were measured for the galactic and host galaxy components of nai  d , respectively , in a high - resolution spectrum obtained with the fies echelle spectrograph at not .",
    "the rise time of sn2007gr is constrained by the kait telescope non - detection of 10 august .",
    "thus the rise time to r maximum turns out to be 14 - 18 days .",
    "the rise time to b maximum ( which occurred on 24 august ) is 10 - 14 days , intermediate between those of sn2002ap ( 8 days , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sn1999ex ( 18 days , * ? ? ?",
    "after maximum , the luminosity decline rate is similar to that of sne 2002ap and 1999ex , while sne 2004aw and 1998bw are slower , and sn1994i is faster .",
    "from the light curve comparison and the photospheric velocity evolution , we can get some estimates for the physical parameters of sn2007gr .",
    "the absolute r maximum of sn2007gr , @xmath26 is similar to that of sn2002ap ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore these sne likely produced a similar amount of @xmath28ni ( @xmath18 0.07 - 0.1 m@xmath1 ) , sn2007gr possibly slightly more than sn2002ap owing to the longer rise time .        since the photospheric velocity of sn2007gr around maximum is similar to that of sn  1994i ,",
    "while the peak of the light curve is 1.5 times broader , we expect an ejected mass of @xmath35 m@xmath1 , and a kinetic energy @xmath36 erg .",
    "a more robust estimate of the ejected mass and kinetic energy will be derived from the nebular data and their detailed modelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but our preliminary estimates already suggest that sn2007gr resembles sn2002ap in terms of mass ejected even though the kinetic energy is a factor of two smaller .",
    "this combination makes sn2007gr similar to sn1994i with respect to the ratio of kinetic energy to ejected mass , but with a steeper density profile , resulting in narrow lines .",
    "the analysis of the photospheric phase of sn2007gr confirms the wide variety of ic sne , not only in light - curve shape and width of the spectral features , but also in the range of carbon abundances and the shape of underlying density profiles .",
    "if asymmetry is the key to explain this heterogeneity , the similar light curves of sn2007gr and sn2002ap combined with the different density profiles ( compact for sn2007gr and extended for sn2002ap ) may suggest that sn2007gr and sn2002ap were asymmetric bipolar explosions observed close to the minor and major axis , respectively .",
    "nebular spectra may provide important information to corroborate this hypothesis .",
    "other scenarios to explain the heterogeneity of stripped - envelope cc sne ( different progenitor , radius , mass , chemical composition , circumstellar environment ) can not be excluded on the basis of the present data .",
