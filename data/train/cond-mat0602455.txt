    "the last two decades have seen an explosive growth of the investigations on nanoscale materials .",
    "carbon nanotubes have taken a rather large part of this effort by blazing a trail in experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "this is due to their unique chemical , electrical and mechanical properties because of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) confinement of their electronic states , resulting in the so - called van hove singularities ( vhss ) in the density of states ( dos ) . with their engrossing properties they have enormous applications in very different areas , ranging from electronics to biotechnology .",
    "research on controlled synthesis of nanotubes to progress the standards of applications is still a grand challenge .",
    "recent progresses may make single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) to play an important role in future nanometer scale integrated photonic devices , in quantum optics and in biological sensing [ 1 ] .",
    "swcnts can be thought of as graphite cylinders formed by connecting two crystallographically equivalent sites in a graphite sheet .",
    "a graphite sheet is a @xmath0-system based on @xmath1 hybridized carbon atoms consisting of strongly bound @xmath2-electrons and a zero - gap semiconductor in the sense that the conduction and valance bands consisting @xmath0 states cross at k and k@xmath3 points of brilloin zone . as derived from the graphite sheet by the zone folding method , a ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) type tube is metallic , possessing nonzero dos in the region near fermi energy , if @xmath6 is a multiple of 3 since electronic band crosses the fermi level at two - thirds of the way to the zone edge .",
    "these are correct as far as we remain true to zone folding approximation [ 2 ] .",
    "the tight - binding approximation has played an important role as one of the most commonly used calculation method for quasi - one - dimensional and higher - dimensional systems .",
    "the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model acquiesces this approximation and is commonly used to study the stability and electronic structure of nanotubes . in this model , hops of the @xmath0 electrons between neighboring carbon atoms are studied and the local electron - phonon interaction is treated in an adiabatic approximation [ 3,4 ] .    the ssh model treats the roles of all bonds , tilt or right , on an equal footing . however",
    ", chainlike structure of graphene and hence of nanotubes brings in mind that the role of tilt and right bonds in the lattice and electronic structure of nanotubes might be different . as a matter of fact cabria _",
    "et al . _ [ 5 ] during an investigation of the stability of narrow zigzag carbon nanotubes in the context of local density functional calculations found that the axial bonds becoming shorter and more @xmath1-like in character , while the other bonds are becoming longer and more @xmath7-like in character .",
    "inspired by these , we found it worthwhile to modify the ssh hamiltonian used by harigaya for studying the stability and energy gap properties of nanotubes [ 6 - 10 ] by considering the contributions of bonds of different types to the ssh hamiltonian differently at the very beginning .",
    "we introduced this modified version of harigaya s model and its application to armchair type nanotubes in [ 11 ] and some other preliminary results elsewhere [ 12 ] . concerning the ( 3,0 )",
    "zigzag nanotube , we observed that the tiny energy gap appearing in harigaya s model was lost , a result consistent with the metallicity of this tube [ 13 ] . in this work",
    ", we continue to investigate the electronic structure of zigzag type nanotubes .",
    "the aforementioned modified version of harigaya s model is based on the ssh hamiltonian which includes different roles of the tilt and right bonds .",
    "this is achieved by taking the hopping integral of the ideal undimerized system , the electron - phonon coupling constants and the spring constants different for the tilt and right bonds . in this way",
    "the introduction of two lagrange multipliers and hence two constraints become unavoidable .",
    "the separation of the constraint into two constraints , vanishing of the sum of right bond distortions and vanishing of the sum of tilt bond distortions , provides more freedom for lattice relaxations .",
    "the total energy of the system is read as    @xmath8 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{2\\gamma^{{\\mathrm{r}}}}\\sum_{i}[v_i^{{\\mathrm{r}}}]^2\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath9s are the eigenvalues of the model hamiltonian . the self - consistent equation for the lattice",
    "is extracted as    @xmath10\\,.\\ ] ]    above @xmath11s are the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian and @xmath12 ^ 2/\\kappa^{{\\mathrm{t , r}}}$ ] .",
    "the prime indicates the sum over the occupied states of electrons and @xmath13 is the total number of @xmath0-bonds .",
    "it is 1.5 times of the number of sites @xmath14 . @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 s are numerically calculated in the iteration method by the adiabatic approximation for phonons and the calculation was kept further to have converged once @xmath16 varied less than @xmath17 .",
    "the determination of energy eigenvalues , @xmath18s and energy eigenstates , @xmath11s by solving schrodinger s equations necessitates the knowledge of the matrix representation of model s hamiltonian .",
    "it is quite clear that this matrix representation depends strictly on the geometry , _ i.e. _ , whether one plans to do the calculations for a carbon sheet , for an open ended nanotube or a nanotube with periodic boundaries , since the hamiltonian is different for different geometries .    to be able to calculate the electronic band structure properties of different geometries all together we preferred to write the matrix representation of electronic part of our hamiltonian in a compact manner as follows    @xmath19    where `` @xmath20 ' 's represents continuation of @xmath21 and @xmath22 matrices and    @xmath23 _ a= (    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     transition frequencies @xmath24 @xmath25 in the optical spectral range for ( 3,0 ) , ( 4,0 ) and ( 9,0 ) open ended nanotubes and nanotubes with periodic boundaries",
    "are selected from the calculated transition energies and are shown in table 1 .",
    "electronic properties , band with ; band gap and vhss of three zigzag nanotubes , ( 3,0 ) ( small radius - conducting ) , ( 4,0 ) ( semiconducting ) and ( 9,0 ) ( large radius - conducting ) are comparatively studied in a toy model and in the harigaya s model .",
    "the toy model is an extension of the harigaya s model , it includes the contributions of bonds of different types to the ssh hamiltonian differently .",
    "both models give the same band width . in the ( 3,0 ) case , the band gap appearing according to the harigaya s model disappears when the toy model is used for periodic conditions .",
    "both models give the same band gap for ( 4,0 ) nanotube .",
    "it agrees well with the gap value given in the literature . for ( 9,0 ) the results of both models",
    "are the same .",
    "when the toy model is used one gets many more vhss . for ( 9,0 )",
    "we obtained an extra singularity in the vicinity of fermi energy .",
    "the calculated next three singularities agree with those given in the literature .",
    "we could not find any data in the literature for the correlation of the other singularities .",
