    "when low - mass stars like our sun are born , they slowly accrete gas from the collapsing cloud through an accretion disc .",
    "collimated outflows are also typically seen in most of these objects .",
    "the discontinuous knots seen in outflows from these objects , and the mismatch of accretion rate between envelope to disc and disc to star ( known as luminosity problem ) in young stellar objects ( ysos ) , all hint to an episodic nature of accretion instead of an ideal steady inflow @xcite .",
    "the other important feature seen in these objects is the outburst .",
    "rare outbursts that we see among these ysos are found to be correlated with an order of magnitude increase in mass infall rate and they could be the episodic accretion events required to explain the outflow discontinuities and luminosity problem .",
    "these outbursts are empirically classified as fuors ( decades long outbursts with 4 - 5 magnitude change in optical ) and exors ( few months - years long outbursts with 2 - 3 magnitude change in optical ) @xcite . due to the short timescales of outbursts in comparison to millions of years timescale of star formation , these events are extremely rare and only less than a dozen confirmed fuor outbursts have been detected so far . from their frequency of outburst",
    "it is estimated that every low - mass yso should go through these outbursts at least 50 times in its protostellar phase @xcite . regarding the discontinuous knots seen in outflows",
    ", it should be noted that the timescales between discontinuities were estimated to be of the order of @xmath6 years by @xcite and the timescales between fuor outbursts in a single star were estimated to be of the order of @xmath7 years by @xcite .",
    "so the discontinuities could be due to some other shorter timescale variations in accretion rate rather than classical fuors .",
    "but as @xcite pointed out , we do not have a good estimate of fuors timescales in the early class i stage .",
    "hence we can not rule out the possibility that discontinuities in outflows are created during fuors events .",
    "one such object which was extensively studied recently in literature is ( v1647 orionis ) , 400 pc away in the l1630 dark cloud of orion .",
    "it underwent a sudden outburst of @xmath8 mag in optical in 2003 @xcite and illuminated a reflection nebula , now named as mcneil s nebula after its discoverer jay mcneil .",
    "@xcite reported 3 mag increase in near - infrared ( nir ) and @xcite reported 25 times increase in 12 @xmath9 flux and no flux change in submillimeter of v1647 ori during the outburst .",
    "@xcite reported a 50 times increase in x - ray flux of v1647 ori during the outburst , and noted that the derived temperature of the plasma is too high for accretion alone to explain and hinted that magnetic reconnection events might be heating up the plasma .",
    "based on the upper limit on radio continuum emission from mcneil s nebula at 1272 mhz from giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , india , @xcite constrained the extent of hii region corresponding to a temperature @xmath10 2500 k to be @xmath11 26 au .",
    "spectroscopic studies showed strong h@xmath12 and ca ii ir triplet lines in emission @xcite . in nir region , strong co bandheads ( 2.29 @xmath9 ) and br@xmath13 line ( 2.16 @xmath9 ; implying strong accretion ) were detected in emission @xcite .",
    "the strong p - cygni profile in h@xmath12 emission indicated wind - velocity ranging from 600 - 300 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out au scale observations using very large telescope interferometer/ mid - infrared interferometric instrument ( vlti / midi ) . by fitting both spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and visibility values they deduced a moderately flaring disc with temperature profile @xmath14 ( t(1au)=680k ) and mass @xmath15 , with inner radius of 7 @xmath16 ( 0.03 au ) and outer radius of 100 au .",
    "this temperature profile is shallower than the @xmath17 canonical model @xcite .",
    "they also reported that the mid - infrared emitting region at 10 @xmath9 has a size of @xmath5 7 au .",
    "@xcite used the co lines in infrared ( ir ) to measure the temperature of the inner accretion disc region which was estimated to be t @xmath18 2500 k.    @xcite and @xcite reported a sudden dimming and termination of the 2003 outburst in november 2005 .",
    "thus , 2003 outburst lasted for a total of @xmath5 2 years and v1647 ori returned to its pre - outburst phase in early 2006 .",
    "@xcite estimated the inclination angle of disc to be @xmath19 and also estimated the accretion rate to be @xmath20 yr@xmath2 during outburst and @xmath21 yr@xmath2 in 2006 quiescent state .",
    "@xcite reported that @xmath5 37 years prior to 2003 outburst , i.e. in 1966 , v1647 ori had undergone a similar magnitude of outburst , lasting for a duration somewhere between 5 to 20 months .",
    "contrary to expected decades long quiescense , underwent a second outburst in 2008 just after spending two years in quiescent state @xcite .",
    "it brightened up to the same magnitude and had almost identical spectral features in optical and nir as the first outburst .",
    "one striking difference was that the strong co bandhead emission at 2.29 @xmath9 was absent in second outburst @xcite .",
    "the x - ray flux with plasma temperature of 2 - 6 kev during both outbursts was postulated to be due to magnetic reconnection events in the disc - star magnetic field interaction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite normalised and combined both outbursts data in x - ray and detected one day periodicity in light curve , which they modeled with two accretion hot spots on the top and bottom hemispheres of the star rotating with one day period and inclination of @xmath22 .",
    "figure [ img : crosssec - diag ] shows the overall cross - section picture of the surroundings of v1647 ori we know so far .",
    "v1647 ori provides a unique opportunity to understand the physical processes undergone in fuors or exors kind of outbursts .",
    "the short time scale behaviors of this object make it possible for us to make a detailed study of the object . in literature there",
    "exists mainly three kinds of model for explaining the outburst phenomena ( see section [ modelsndiscuss ] ) .",
    "the differences between these models are all in the inner region of disc ( @xmath23 1 au ) , and optical and nir are the right wavelength regime to probe this region of the disc .",
    "detailed understanding of v1647 ori will thus provide us a laboratory to check our understanding of various instabilities like thermal , gravitational and magnetorotational in proto - planetary disc around young low - mass stars .",
    "we have carried out continuous observations for more than four and a half years ( 2008 - 2013 ) of v1647 ori in optical and nir wavelengths for detailed study of its dynamics during outburst and post - outburst stages of the second outburst .",

    "this is because the contamination of flux from nebula into v1647 ori s aperture was a function of atmospheric seeing .",

    "hence , the region c , seems to be dimming faster than v1647 ori .",
    "this could be either due to material inflow into cavity between region c and v1647 ori as the outburst is progressing or due to a change in extinction along the cavity induced by slow dimming of v1647 ori s brightness . during the first outburst in 2003 , the linear dimming rate during the plateau stage was 0.24 mag yr@xmath2 in _",

    "the optical magnitudes during the second outburst are almost similar to that of the first outburst in 2003 .",
    "in fact the first known outburst of v1647 ori in 1966 ( @xmath5 38 years prior to 2003 ) , reported by @xcite , also had similar magnitude to the present one , however , all these three outbursts have different timescales",

    "the position of v1647 ori in cc diagram is consistent with similar cc diagram published by @xcite .",
    "this implies that the decrease in line of sight extinction during the outburst is same as that seen during the 2003 outburst .",
    "since our line of sight is through the envelope , it must be likely due to a reversible mechanism like dust sublimation in the inner region of envelope during each outburst @xcite .",
    "since the star is deeply embedded , we have reflections and dust emission effects also affecting the position of v1647 ori in the cc diagram .",
    "so the extinction estimated from cc diagram is not very reliable .",
    "otherwise , we can see that the second outburst has cleared out circumstellar matter of @xmath50 mag .",

    "we can see that the region c is brighter in second outburst than it was in 2004 .",
    "this could be due to dust clearing up between the last two outbursts along the cavity seen in nir in region c direction @xcite .",
    "our photometric results show region c is dimming faster than v1647 ori and one of the explanations for that could be material inflow into cavity during the outburst .",
    "however , region c is relatively brighter in 2008 outburst than in 2004 for the same brightness of v1647 ori .",
    "this implies that the matter inflow to cavity was not occurring during the quiescent phase between 2006 and 2008 .",
    "this is also based on the implicit assumption that the extinction along the line of sight direction to v1647 ori is same between 2003 and 2008 outbursts .",
    "the other significant change is in illumination of the south - western knot ( region b ) of the nebula ; its illumination seems to have shifted slightly towards west .",
    "these illumination changes in nebula imply a structural change in the circumstellar matter above the disc and cavity .",

    "the @xmath52 of 2008 outburst is in similar range of that during first outburst in 2003 .",
    "since @xmath29 emission comes from the innermost accretion powered hot zone , we can expect its strength to be proportional to the accretion rate .",
    "the optical photometric magnitude in second outburst is similar to that of first outburst , which implies the continuum flux is almost of the same value .",
    "hence from the fact that @xmath52 is of similar value as of first outburst , we can deduce that the accretion rate is also of the same order in both the outbursts during its high plateaustage .",

    "@xcite had concluded that the optical density of the region emitting ca ii ir triplet lines changed significantly between outburst and quiescent phases .",
    "but since there is only one data point from quiescent phase and it is lying within the scatter of points from ongoing outburst , it might be difficult to conclude that the change in ratios observed was actually due to v1647 ori moving from quiescent phase to outburst phase .",

    "this implies that the fluctuations in @xmath52 are not random statistical error",
    ". it could be due to fluctuations of continuum flux around @xmath65 .",
    "peak - to - peak fluctuations of @xmath52 is @xmath66 , which means if the flux from these lines is assumed to be constant then the continuum flux has fluctuated by a factor of @xmath67 , which in terms of the log scale of magnitude is @xmath68 .",
    "this indeed matches with peak - to - peak fluctuation in _",
    "i_-band magnitude during the entire period .",
    "we do not see any strong correlation between @xmath52 of @xmath29 line and ca ii ir triplets .",
    "however , it should be noted that the error bars in @xmath52 of @xmath29 are much higher than that of ca ii ir lines due to low continuum flux around @xmath69 .    in 2008",
    "october 29 spectrum , we could clearly detect p - cygni profile in ca ii ir triplet lines ( figure [ img : caii20081029 ] ) .",
    "the strengths of absorption trough of the three lines were in the same pattern as that of t - tauri star wl 22 @xcite , i.e. the pattern with strongest absorption in @xmath70 , then @xmath71 and very weak in @xmath72 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath52 of the blue - shifted absorption between @xmath70 and @xmath71 is 0.76 : 0.45 = 1.69 : 1 .",

    "the episodic nature of these two winds implies they are magnetic reconnection driven winds rather than pressure driven steady winds .    even though our medium resolution spectra can not be used to study line widths , since the ca ii ir triplets are near by , we could do relative comparison of the widths of the ca ii ir triplet lines , where width is taken to be the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of gaussian fit of the continuum normalised profile . since this quantity is the fwhm of gaussian profile that we get after the convolution of instrument response on the actual line , it is not the fwhm of the line . however ,",
    "since the lines are very close and the instrumental convolution is common , the wider line will give a wider fwhm after convolution .",

    "the models which are known for fuor / exor outbursts can be broadly classified into three .",
    "first kind of model is purely a thermal instability model , initially proposed for dwarf nova systems and was later adapted for fuors kind of outbursts @xcite .",
    "the second kind of model involves a binary companion or planet , which perturbs the disc causing repeated sudden high accretion events @xcite .",
    "the third kind involves mainly gravitational instability triggering magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite model ( hereafter bl94 ) is a pure thermal instability model . in bl94 ,",
    "the thermal instability is triggered when the surface density at a region in disc rises above a critical density .",
    "the viscous timescales determine duration of outbursts and quiescent phase .",
    "the inner region at a radius @xmath104 during outburst will deplete below the critical surface density in viscous time scale @xmath105 .",
    "based on @xmath12 prescription of viscosity , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath108 is the disc thickness , @xmath109 is orbital angular velocity at radius @xmath104 and @xmath12 ( @xmath110 ) is a dimensionless parameter ( see figure [ img : alphadisc ] ) . substituting , we get a relation : + @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath112 be the effective inward radial velocity component of gas in inner accretion disc .",
    "then the mass infall rate at radius _",
    "r _ is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the surface density of disc at that radius . substituting @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 in above equation of @xmath118",
    ", we get @xmath119 .",
    "the time scale of transition between outburst and quiescent phases is much smaller than the viscous timescale .",
    "hence , @xmath114 will remain constant , @xmath109 will also remain constant at a given _",
    "r _ , which leaves only the parameter @xmath120 to explain the change by a factor of @xmath5 10 in inner disc accretion rate to v1647 ori between the outburst and quiescent phases .",
    "since the square of isothermal sound speed @xmath121 ( where @xmath122 is the gas constant , t is temperature and @xmath123 is mean molecular weight ) , the temperature change by a factor 10 between the phases at the trigger of thermal instability ( @xcite , appendix b , their figure 14 ) alone will cause a net change in accretion rate by factor of 10 .",
    "hence , at least in the inner region of disc , @xmath12 can change only by a multiplicative factor of order 1 to remain consistent with the observed change in accretion rate .    in bl94",
    ", assuming the mass infall rate to the inner disc region @xmath124 , the @xmath12 determines the timescales and the ratio @xmath125 is proportional to the ratio of time in quiescent phase to time in outburst phase ( bl94 ; table 2 ) .",
    "figure [ img : lightcurvecartoon ] shows the schematic of the lightcurve of v1647 ori in optical band we know so far .",
    "the photometric magnitudes and overall sed during the quiescent phase in 2007 match with pre 2003 outburst data @xcite .",
    "even though accretion rate had fallen by a factor of 10 during quiescent phase , it was still in the order of @xmath126 @xmath127 .",
    "based on this , @xcite had suggested that the 2003 outburst might not have actually terminated in 2006 . since we do not have a good estimate of pre - outburst accretion rate , we shall consider this sudden drop in accretion rate by a factor of 10 as a drop from outburst state to quiescent phase in outburst models .",
    "let @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 represent the three outburst phase @xmath12 values and @xmath131 and @xmath132 represent the two quiescent phase @xmath12 values .",

    ". however , our accretion estimates , during the 2003 as well as 2008 outbursts show the accretion rate of matter on to the star from inner disc was quite stable at @xmath510 times the rate in quiescent phase .",
    "thus the @xmath12 parameter can not be fluctuating as much as we estimated ; especially @xmath142 is impossible from the fact that viscosity has to be more in outburst phase than quiescent phase .",
    "then the assumption @xmath133 in bl94 might be wrong .",
    "an increase in @xmath138 can decrease the draining rate of inner disc and can account for a longer duration of outburst period .",
    "it can also explain the slower rate of dimming in the magnitude of the v1647 ori during its plateau stage in present outburst compared to 2003 outburst .    by letting @xmath138 to be a variable and substituting @xmath143 to be the radius upto which instability extends , to constrain parameters , we compared the viscous timescale @xmath144 between 2003 and 2008 outbursts .",
    "the instability triggering temperature at the boundary has to be same for both outbursts , so the sound speed @xmath107 will be the same .",
    "parameter @xmath12 can also be taken to be same during both the outbursts based on our previous conclusion .",
    "now the only free variable parameter which determines the timescale is @xmath143 . substituting keplarian @xmath145",

    ".    model presented by @xcite includes an mri instability contribution to viscosity parameter if the temperature of the disc goes above mri triggering temperature ( @xmath150 ) and also includes an effective viscosity contribution from gravitational instability beyond the radius given by toomre s instability parameter q. the relation between @xmath143 and @xmath118 in this model is @xmath151 + thus , @xmath152 , and hence @xmath153 .",
    "+ therefore , the infall of gas from outer to inner disc during 2008 outburst is at least 3500 times ( 3 orders ) more than that during 2003 outburst .",
    "this estimate is one order more than bl94 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the viscosity timescale gives only order of magnitude estimate of the duration of outburst . for a comparison of actual simulated duration of outburst and viscous timescale",
    "see table 1 in @xcite . if the present outburst continues for a larger period , @xmath154 ratio will further increase .",
    "since we have an upper limit in @xmath138 for fuors , the increased ratio could only be explained as a dip in mass inflow in 2003 .",
    "for example , a gap in disc could have resulted in sudden ending of 2003 outburst .",
    "this gap or low density region has to be near the typical @xmath143 predicted by each model , i.e. @xmath155 .    to estimate the change in photometric magnitudes between 2003 and 2008 outburst phase due to predicted change in radius @xmath143 , we modelled a disc with temperature profile given by outburst accretion rate inside @xmath143 and quiescent accretion rate outside @xmath143 .",
    "the magnitude variations in optical _",
    "i _ and nir _ j _ bands were found to be less than 1 mag for variation of @xmath143 by a factor of 6 .",
    "@xcite reported an increase in visibility of resolved interferometric study of v1647 ori using vlti / midi observations in 8 - 13 @xmath123 m range during the early stage of fading in 2003 outburst ( between 2005 march and 2005 september ) .",
    "apart from the possible scenarios discussed by @xcite , it could also be explained by the relative increase in contribution in total flux from the extended outburst disc when the central star s accretion slowed down .",
    "a similar vlti / midi visibility study of the ongoing 2008 outburst will give more input to constrain @xmath143 and outburst models .",
    "thus , we conclude that a pure thermal instability alone can not explain the varying timescales of outbursts occurring in v1647 ori . as proposed for other short rise timescale fuors , v1647 ori can also be explained only by an outside - in triggering of the instability from outer radius @xcite . the change in inflow of material from outer to inner disc could be due to many possibilities like mri , gravitational instability ( gi ) or planet perturbation .",
    "the smooth surface density assumptions of disc also might not be a good model in light of detection of clump in the disc at 0.27 au and disappearance of it in second outburst .",

    "detection of the forbidden [ oi ] @xmath158 and [ fe ii ] @xmath157 lines implies shock regions of @xmath99 and @xmath159 @xmath59 , probably originating from jets .",
    "timescales of outburst history of v1647 ori can not be explained by a simple thermal instability model by @xcite alone .",
    "to explain the large change in accretion rate from outer to inner disc between last two outbursts we require more comprehensive models which includes contribution from mri , gi and planetary perturbations . from the framework of instability models",

    "<S> we present a detailed study of mcneil s nebula ( v1647 ori ) in its ongoing outburst phase starting from september 2008 to march 2013 . </S>",

    "<S> our observations show that over last four and a half years , v1647 ori and the region c near herbig - haro object , hh 22a , have been undergoing a slow dimming at a rate of @xmath1 mag yr@xmath2 and @xmath3 mag yr@xmath2 respectively in _ r_-band , which is 6 times slower than the rate during similar stage of v1647 ori in 2003 outburst . </S>",
    "<S> we detected change in flux distribution over the reflection nebula implying changes in circumstellar matter distribution between 2003 and 2008 outbursts . apart from steady wind of velocity @xmath4 km s@xmath2 we detected two episodic magnetic reconnection driven winds . </S>",
    "<S> forbidden [ o i ] 6300@xmath0 and [ fe ii ] 7155@xmath0 lines were also detected implying shock regions probably from jets . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that one possible reason for sudden ending of 2003 outburst in 2005 november was due to a low density region or gap in the inner region ( @xmath5 1 au ) of the disc . </S>"
