    "the spectral theory of graphs @xcite parallels to a great deal the spectral theory of compact riemannian manifolds @xcite .",
    "there are areas with a good match like inverse spectral topics , heat kernel related topics like hodge theory where the dimension of the space of harmonic solutions @xmath25 for example is the number of connected components and more generally , harmonic @xmath26-forms are related to the kth cohomology groups in a rather explicit way as applying the heat flow to @xmath26 forms converges to harmonic forms .",
    "this can be used for example to construct the hurewicz homomorphism from @xmath27 to the cohomology groups @xmath28 by applying the heat flow @xmath29 on a @xmath26-form @xmath30 supported initially on a @xmath26-sphere representing an element in the homotopy group @xmath27 .",
    "it leads to a harmonic @xmath26-form representing a homology class .",
    "discrete mckean - singer @xcite @xmath31 illustrates further , how the graph theory parallels the continuum @xcite : the super trace of the heat kernel for @xmath32 is the super trace of @xmath33 which is the definition of the euler characteristic , while in the case @xmath34 , it counts the alternating sum of the betti numbers , which by euler - poincar is the same .",
    "the cohomology of discretizations of manifolds has since the beginning of the development of algebraic topology been used to compute the cohomology of the manifold . for the convergence of the spectrum of @xmath35-form laplacians of a compact connected riemannian manifold @xmath36 of dimension @xmath23 , mantuano",
    "s theorem @xcite tells that for any @xmath37 discretization @xmath0 given by a graph , the spectra of the hodge laplacians @xmath38 are related by @xmath39 , where the constants @xmath40 only depend on dimension @xmath15 , the maximal curvature and radius of injectivity of @xmath36 . also for eigenfunctions ,",
    "the number of nodal regions of the @xmath26 eigenfunction @xmath41 is bound by a theorem of fiedler @xcite by @xmath26 , paralleling the courant nodal theorem .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath42 is estimated in the same way from below by the cheeger constant .",
    "the nodal regions on geometric graphs correspond to chladni figures on compact riemannian manifolds .",
    "also in topology like for brouwer - lefshetz @xcite or jordan - brouwer theory @xcite , the notions translate nicely to the discrete and barycentric refinements help .",
    "there are also places , where things are different : the weyl law relating the growth of the eigenvalues with volume has no direct discrete analogue because the spectrum of a graph is a finite set .",
    "similarly , the minashisundaram - plejel zeta function @xmath43 of a manifold needs analytic continuation in the continuum , while in the graph case , the zeta function is an entire function .",
    "already in the case of a circle , where the dirac version of that zeta function is the riemann zeta function , the zeros of the discrete analog on circular graphs can be analyzed well , unlike in the continuum , where it it is the riemann hypothesis .",
    "the convergence of the roots @xcite of the graph zeta functions is a limit when looking at barycentric subdivisions of circular graphs , which is also important for jacobi matrices generalizing graph laplacians @xcite which we studied in @xcite in an ergodic setup , where the limiting operators are almost periodic jacobi matrices over the von neumann - kakutani system .",
    "the later is the unique fixed point of the 2:1 integral extension operation in ergodic theory .",
    "the hull of the operators is the compact abelian group of dyadic integers , where space translation is addition by 1 and where the renormalization step is the shift .",
    "we look now at higher dimensional analogue questions to these one dimensional jacobi spectral problems .",
    "there are other analogies between schrdinger operators and geometric laplacians : while isospectral deformations are possible in the former case , geometric laplacians are harder to deform as the isospectral set of geometries is discrete in general .",
    "having worked with isospectral deformations of jacobi matrices in @xcite we looked in @xcite at higher dimensions and noted that writing @xmath44 can enable isospectral deformation and break the spectral rigidity .",
    "much later , we realized that in the riemannian as well as in the graph case , one can deform the exterior derivative @xmath15 @xcite in an isospectral way .",
    "the riemannian case is a bit more technical in that story as the deformed exterior derivatives @xmath45 are pseudo differential equations in the continuum but they satisfy @xmath46 so that they deform cohomology",
    ". the deformation does not affect the laplacian @xmath47 , but in the complex , the nonlinear deformation becomes asymptotic to the wave evolution .",
    "interestingly , both in the discrete as well as in the continuum , space expands , with an inflationary start .",
    "this is not artificially placed into the model , but is a basic property if one lets the dirac operator move freely in its symmetry group .",
    "graphs can serve as a laboratory to test concepts related to physics .",
    "it is reasonable for example to see the evolutions of the various differential forms under the wave dynamics as manifestations of different forces .",
    "it is a caricature for physics , where nothing has put into the system except for geometry , which is a riemannian manifold in the continuum and a graph @xmath0 in the discrete . when answering the question which graph to take , symmetry again could give a hint : take a scale invariant graph . while impossible to achieve in a finite discrete structure , taking a graph which is multiple way refined in a barycentric way comes close .",
    "not only are parts of the graph homeomorphic to the entire graph , but also the nerve graphs of open covers are homeomorphic to the entire graph .",
    "this motivates to look at refinements and its spectral properties .",
    "+    in @xcite , we looked at a product of graphs which satisfies the same knneth formula for cohomology as in the continuum .",
    "this product of @xmath0 and @xmath48 is defined as follows : take two disjoint unions of @xmath0 and @xmath48 . pick a complete subgraph @xmath49 of @xmath0 and a complete subgraph @xmath50 of @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the complete subgraph generated by @xmath52 .",
    "these points @xmath51 form the vertices of @xmath53 .",
    "two such vertices @xmath51 and @xmath54 are connected if one is contained in the other .",
    "a special case is if @xmath55 in which case @xmath56 is the barycentric refinement of @xmath0 : its vertices are the complete subgraphs @xmath49 of @xmath0 and two complete subgraphs @xmath57 are connected if one is contained in an other .",
    "the graph @xmath1 is homotopic to @xmath0 .",
    "it especially has the same euler characteristic .",
    "the dimension of @xmath1 is bounded below by the dimension of @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is geometric , then @xmath1 is even homeomorphic to @xmath0 and the dimensions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the same . for any @xmath15-dimensional geometric @xmath0 ,",
    "the graphs @xmath24 are all @xmath58-colorable , the color being the dimension of the original simplices which make up now the vertices .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath0 also acts on @xmath1 so that fixed points of graph automorphisms @xcite can be realized as vertices in @xmath1 .",
    "barycentric refinements again stress the point of view taken by discrete morse theory @xcite that complete subgraphs in a graph can be treated as  points \" .    for practical triangulations ,",
    "barycentric refinements are rarely used .",
    "the reason is the huge difference between the possible vertex degrees , as each refinement doubles the maximal degree .",
    "but the appearance of large vertex degrees has also benefits : for any @xmath59 , the @xmath24 graphs are eulerian with eulerian spheres and have the property that a natural geodesic flow can be defined on them in any dimension .",
    "this is essential , as spheres and lines are important in any geometry and that for defining lines , we need an eulerian property as with an odd degree vertex , the continuation of a  straight line \" is ambiguous : we have difficulty for example to continue a line through a vertex of an icosahedron as we will have to chose what direction to continue . for graphs",
    "in which all spheres and all spheres in spheres are eulerian , there is a natural continuation .",
    "graph products and especially barycentric refinements have this property .",
    "the large and nonuniform degree of some density distributed vertices has the advantage as it allows to emulate the rotational symmetry in the discrete . for a @xmath15-dimensional graph , and considering @xmath24",
    ", we can in dimension @xmath15 start with a vertex degree of @xmath60 directions .",
    "unlike in regular lattices or tessellations , the spheres appear more rounded and the fact that the unit sphere @xmath61 has asymptotically a similar amount of directions than the number of vertices in @xmath24 gives us the property that the exponential map @xmath62 from the unit sphere to the graph , covers most of the graph .",
    "this is probably the closest we can get to a hopf - rynov property in the discrete without digressing into the quantum ( as nature does ) and look at the wave equation @xmath63 for the hodge laplacian @xmath64 , which because @xmath44 has the dalembert solution @xmath65 , a superposition of wave group solutions @xmath66 of the schroedinger equation @xmath67 with @xmath68 for the dirac operator @xmath69 ( see @xcite ) for which hopf - rynov is just linear algebra in the graph case as the unitary group is finite dimensional and for any two vertices @xmath57 one can solve the problem to start a geodesic on @xmath70 and reach @xmath71 by choosing the correct velocity @xmath72 and time @xmath73 .",
    "+    iterated barycentric subdivisions have long been used in topology and homology theory .",
    "the notion is mostly defined in geometric realizations used to refine a given triangulation of a simplex in euclidean space .",
    "note that we do nt look at any embedding in an euclidean space but look at barycentric refinement in a completely combinatorial setup .",
    "there are also probabilistic connections @xcite , as iterated barycentric subdivisions of a triangle define a random walk on @xmath74 and are linked to concrete geometric properties like angles triangles .",
    "such work could suggest that unlike in the one dimensional case , in higher dimensions , higher dimensional group actions and random walks could play a role when studying the spectrum . in graph theory , where no embedding into an euclidean space is required ,",
    "barycentric subdivisions are known in the context of flag complexes or whitney complexes in particular .",
    "we are not aware of any work on the nature of the spectrum of such graphs .",
    "+ the inductive dimension of a graph @xmath0 is defined inductively as the average of the dimensions of all unit spheres , incremented by @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath0 is a geometric @xmath15-dimensional graph , if every unit sphere is a @xmath75-sphere or a @xmath75-ball and the boundary set of vertices with a ball unit sphere form a @xmath75-dimensional geometric graph without boundary .",
    "geometric graphs play the role of manifolds with or without boundary .",
    "the definition of graph theoretical spheres and homotopy are both due to evako .",
    "we have defined spheres independently in @xcite but realized in @xcite that it is already in the work of ivashchenko = evako @xcite .",
    "the definition of these evako spheres is based on ivashchenko homotopy which is homotopy notion inspired by whitehead @xcite but defined for graphs .",
    "a simplification done in @xcite makes this homotopy much more practical , like for lusternik - schnirelman theory for graphs @xcite , to define what a homeomorphism for graph is @xcite or for graph colorings @xcite , where constructing an eulerian 3 sphere having a given 2 sphere embedded could explain why 4 colors are enough to color a planar graph .",
    "+ we proved in @xcite the inequality @xmath76 , which holds for all finite simple graphs @xmath77 .",
