    "it was inspired by @xmath495-equivariant morse theory .",
    "if we have a space @xmath10 wiht @xmath495 action then @xmath580 where @xmath581 is a bundle over @xmath582 with fibers @xmath10 . basically , we want to do morse theory on this space . for this , take the standard morse function on @xmath583 for large @xmath435 , and combine it with a family of morse functions on the fibers , such that the critical points of the combined function lie over the critical points on @xmath583 :        we get a @xmath495-equivariant morse complex of the form @xmath584_{q\\cdot ( 1 + \\iota ) } & c(x ) \\ar[l]_{q\\cdot ( 1 + \\iota ) }   \\ar@/^1pc/[ll]^{q^2 \\cdot w }    & \\dots \\ar[l]_{q\\cdot ( 1 + \\iota ) }   \\ar@/^1pc/[ll]^{q^2 \\cdot w }   \\ar@/^3pc/[lll]^{q^3 \\cdot z }   } , \\ ] ] where @xmath91 is a chain homotopy between @xmath585 and the identity , @xmath586 is a higher chain homotopy , and so on .",
    "thus , a @xmath0 version of heegaard floer homology should come from a chain complex of the form @xmath587_{q\\cdot ( 1 + \\iota ) } & cf^+   \\ar[l]_{q\\cdot ( 1 + \\iota ) }   \\ar@/^1pc/[ll]^{q^2 \\cdot w }    & \\dots \\ar[l]_{q\\cdot ( 1 + \\iota ) }   \\ar@/^1pc/[ll]^{q^2 \\cdot w }   \\ar@/^3pc/[lll]^{q^3 \\cdot z }   } .\\ ] ]    the problem is that , whereas to define @xmath588 we used naturality for @xmath496 , to define the higher homotopies in the infinite chain complex above we would need naturality to infinite order in heegaard floer theory .",
    "this seems intractable with current technology .",
    "instead , we do a truncation , by setting @xmath589    the truncated complex is the mapping cone @xmath578 .",
    "this justifies the definition of @xmath505 . to see that @xmath505 should correspond to @xmath498-equivariant seiberg - witten floer homology",
    ", one needs the following algebraic - topologic fact .            here",
    ", @xmath591 is a finite dimensional space , and the infinite tower of @xmath381 s is comprised of two sub - towers , connected by the action of @xmath571 .",
    "each sub - tower is isomorphic to @xmath592/u$ ] , so we call them @xmath509-towers ."
