    "recent deep submillimeter ( submm ) surveys with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and the max - plank millimeter bolometer array on the iram telescope have resolved the far - infrared ( fir ) extragalactic background light ( ebl ) detected by cobe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 850 @xmath0 m and 1.2 mm into discrete sources @xcite . in blank field surveys , the resolved point sources with 850 @xmath0 m fluxes in the 2 - 10 mjy range account for 20%-30% of the fir ebl .",
    "the 2 - 10 mjy flux range corresponds to @xmath9 @xmath10 fir luminosity at redshifts greater than 1 , where the observed submm flux is not a function of redshift due to the steep dust spectrum in the submm ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the bright submm source population is inferred to be the distant analog of the local ultraluminous infrared galaxy population @xcite . in lensing cluster field surveys , a further 45% to 65% of the fir elb",
    "is resolved into point sources with 0.3 - 2 mjy intrinsic 850 @xmath0 m fluxes , corresponding to more `` normal '' @xmath11 @xmath10 galaxies ( cowie et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "observations suggest that these submm sources which dominate the fir ebl are mainly high redshift ( @xmath12 ) starburst galaxies @xcite whose submm emission mostly comes from dust heated by young massive stars . because the observed fir ebl is comparable with the total optical / uv ebl , these submm sources are crucial to understand the integrated star formation history of the universe and may be the dominant component of star formation at @xmath12 ( e.g. , barger et al .  2000 ;",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in order to better understand the evolution of the submm sources and the star formation history , it is crucial to accurately determine the surface density of the submm sources , to determine their properties at other wavelengths , and to measure their redshifts .",
    "the surface density of submm sources brighter than 2 mjy was previously determined to be only @xmath13 arcmin@xmath6 ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "1999a ; @xcite ) , implying that any statistical study of this population requires a large survey area .",
    "it is much more difficult , however , to measure the redshift distribution of the submm sources .",
    "the fundamental reason is that the current submm telescopes have very low resolution , as compared to optical telescopes . in most cases ,",
    "a few optical galaxies are found within a submm telescope beam , and it is difficult to unambiguously identify the real counterparts to the submm emission .",
    "it is also time consuming to measure the redshifts for each of these counterpart candidates @xcite .",
    "radio interferometric imaging is the most commonly used method to solve this problem . by assuming that the correlation between the fir and radio fluxes of normal galaxies ( i.e. , galaxies without active galactic nuclei ) in the local universe ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also holds for the submm sources , radio sources near the submm positions could be identified as counterparts ( barger et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the redshifts of the associated optical galaxies may be measured @xcite .",
    "in addition , redshifts of the submm sources could also be independently estimated using the radio and submm fluxes by assuming a plausible spectral energy distribution ( sed , @xcite ; barger et al .",
    "2000 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the limitation of the radio identifications is that only @xmath7 of the _ bright _ ( @xmath14 mjy ) submm sources have radio counterparts ( barger et al.2000 ; @xcite ) .",
    "accurate positions and redshifts for most of the submm sources still can not be measured and will have to await the advent of high resolution submm observations which are now becoming possible with the advent of the submillimeter array @xcite .",
    "we have been carrying out an 850 @xmath0 m scuba survey of intermediate depth ( 0.4 to 4 mjy 1 @xmath1 sensitivity ) over a large area ( @xmath2 arcmin@xmath3 ) centered on the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) .",
    "early results of this survey targeting optically faint radio sources were published in barger et al .  ( 2000 ) .",
    "our 850 @xmath0 m survey covers most of the area imaged by goods ( great observatories origins deep survey ) using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ , @xcite ) and a large part of the _ chandra _ deep field - north ( cdf - n ) observed by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( hereafter _ chandra _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "this field also has deep radio and mid - infrared ( mir ) imaging @xcite , as well as ultra - deep ground - based optical and near - infrared ( nir ) imaging @xcite . the deep radio image at 1.4 ghz provides accurate astrometry and millimetric redshift estimates for the submm sources that have radio counterparts .",
    "our goal is to better constrain the number counts of bright submm sources , and to use the deep multi wavelength data to understand the redshift distribution and the properties of the submm sources . in this paper",
    ", we present the 850 @xmath0 m source catalog , number counts , and the optical , radio , x - ray , and mir counterpart candidates to the submm sources .",
    "scuba jiggle maps at 850 @xmath0 m of the hdf - n flanking fields were obtained in multiple runs between 1999 and 2003 under excellent submm weather conditions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the maps obtained in april and june 1999 were published in barger et al .",
    "each of the scuba maps covers an @xmath16 field - of - view and has typical integration times between 10 ks and 30 ks , depending on weather conditions and other observational constraints .",
    "the maps were dithered with @xmath17 to @xmath18 offsets .",
    "the dithering and the instrumental rotation on the sky prevent most regions of the sky from continuously falling on bad bolometers .",
    "chopping of the secondary was fixed in the r.a .",
    "direction with a @xmath19 chop throw .",
    "such a chop produces two @xmath20 negatives sidelobes to the east and west of the primary beam , which has a @xmath21 full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the @xmath19 chop throw was chosen so that each detected source would have at least one sidelobe inside the @xmath22 field - of - view .",
    "this effectively increases the on - source integration time .",
    "pointing checks were performed before and after each @xmath23 hour of on - source observation and every time after transit . a nearby radio source (",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 ) was used for the pointing checks .",
    "the typical pointing offset is @xmath29 , and no offset greater than @xmath30 was observed .",
    "the jcmt has noted a newly discovered tracking error .",
    "we calculated the pointing error caused by this and found that most of our target fields and pointing sources have combined tracking errors @xmath31 , comparable to the normal pointing errors . a few observations at coordinates @xmath32 have @xmath33 errors , corresponding to 0.12 beam fwhm .",
    "these observations only contribute 25% to the integration time in this region .",
    "we thus conclude that our pointing and astrometry are not seriously affected by this tracking error .",
    "flux calibration was done every night using the primary calibrator mars or the secondary calibrators crl 618 , crl 2688 , irc + 10216 , or oh 231.8 .",
    "if the variable calibrator irc + 10216 was used , a non - variable calibrator such as crl 618 or a primary calibrator would be observed in the same run to confirm its light curve . on each night , the flux was calibrated using a @xmath34 aperture centered at the primary beam of the calibrator .",
    "the size of the aperture is not critical in this research as long as the same aperture size is adopted each night .",
    "this is because the filter function we used for flux measurements will be renormalized by a calibrator ( see   [ id_cat ] ) , and the flux measurement is independent of the aperture size .",
    "the sky opacity was monitored during the observations in various ways .",
    "standard `` sky dips '' that give the most reliable 850 @xmath0 m opacities were obtained every two to four hours , depending on the stability of the weather .",
    "the jcmt water vapor monitor ( wvm ) was used when available to obtain the sky opacity every six seconds toward the same direction of the telescope beam . when the wvm was not available , opacity values from the caltech submillimeter observatory tau - dipper ( @xmath35 )",
    "were used to monitor the opacity change every ten minutes .",
    "we found that for most of the time , the sky - dip values were consistent with the wvm values , while the @xmath35 values have larger errors .",
    "the jiggle maps described above contain 73.2 hours of integration in total .",
    "in addition to our maps , we also used that part of the ultra - deep jiggle map centered at the hdf - proper from the archive which had matched chopping .",
    "this ultra - deep map was first presented in @xcite and was extensively analyzed by @xcite .",
    "we did not attempt to fully reproduce their results , and we did not use all of the archival data . we only included the data taken with a @xmath19 east - west chop throw , identical to our standard one .",
    "in other words , our final jiggle map contains all the scuba data taken with an identical strategy .",
    "this gives a uniform point spread function ( psf ) over the entire field and allows us to analyze the data in a consistent way ( cf .",
    ", the hdf super - map that contains a scan map and jiggle maps taken with various chops ; @xcite ) .",
    "the data included here consist of 94.7 hours of integration and cover an area of @xmath2 arcmin@xmath3 with 0.4 to 4 mjy ( 1 @xmath1 ) point - source sensitivity .",
    "the data were reduced using the package scuba user reduction facility ( surf ; @xcite ) . in surf ,",
    "the data were flat - fielded , atmospheric extinction corrected , and pointing corrected , and the sky noise was removed in standard ways ) showed strong noise signals .",
    "we inspected all of the data and manually removed the bolometers showing such strong noise signals .",
    "other bolometers potentially having this problem were excluded during the sky noise removal but were still included in our final maps . because we already took the bolometer variance ( represented by the weight assigned to each bolometer ) into account when making maps and extracting sources , these noisy bolometers should not affect our analyses . ] .",
    "the extinction correction made use of the sky - dip results when the opacity was stable or the wvm results when the opacity varied rapidly .",
    "before maps were made , the data were weighted according to the bolometer variance relative to the central bolometer in the first observation .",
    "maps were made in surf with the rebin routine . however , because rebin can not handle more than 200 observations ( we had 244 observations ) , we divided the data into two roughly equal halves and rebined them individually .",
    "rebin generated the sky maps , integration time maps , and weight maps from each half of the data .",
    "we then combined the two sets of maps to form the final sky , integration time , and weight maps .",
    "we present our final sky map in figure  [ hdf_sky ] .",
    "in addition to the sky map , we also constructed a `` true noise '' map in which all of the sources have been cleaned out , such that the map contains only the bolometer and sky noise , following the procedure introduced in cowie et al .",
    "after bright sources were detected and removed from each of the two half maps using the method described in ",
    "[ id_cat ] , the true noise map was constructed by subtracting the two half maps from one another .",
    "the map was then scaled by the factor @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are weighted integration times for each pixel in the two half maps .",
    "this effectively removes all celestial objects .",
    "noise measured in this way is generally lower than that directly measured from the sky map , which contains confusion noise from undetected faint sources . in particular , for the deepest region at the hdf - proper where confusion becomes important , we found that the true noise is @xmath39 lower than the that measured from the cleaned sky map . in this paper , all analyses are based on the true noise .",
    "our source detection algorithm is optimized for single point - like sources . to detect such sources , the optimal filter function is the telescope beam inversely weighted by the noise in each pixel .",
    "the telescope beam includes the primary beam and the two negative sidelobes .",
    "this allows recovery of the integration times on the sidelobes and enhances the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the detected sources .",
    "such s / n enhancement is up to @xmath40 if both sidelobes fall in the field - of - view .",
    "the noise of each pixel is represented by the integration time and bolometer variance that is contained in the weights assigned to the pixel .",
    "we thus calculated the beam - optimized flux map ( @xmath41 , hereafter the flux map ) using @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the sky map , @xmath44 is the integration time map , @xmath45 is the weight map , @xmath46 is the normalized beam response , and @xmath47 denotes convolution .",
    "the telescope beam response was obtained from observations of point - like calibrators .",
    "it was normalized to yield correct point - source fluxes by using eq .",
    "[ beamwflux ] on a calibrator .",
    "the flux calculated with eq .  [ beamwflux ] also yields the minimum @xmath48 for point sources ( see @xcite for the derivation ) . the error associated with the beam - optimized flux ( i.e. , 1 @xmath1 sensitivity )",
    "was calculated by propagating the errors in eq .",
    "[ beamwflux ] using @xmath49 the proportionality is because surf arbitrarily normalizes weight and integration time to the central pixel in the first observation . the proper normalization of eq .",
    "[ beamwerror ] utilizes the true noise map .",
    "the error map from eq .",
    "[ beamwerror ] was scaled by a constant so that the noise flux measured using eq .",
    "[ beamwflux ] in the true noise map has a mean s / n of 1 .",
    "the normalized error map is presented in figure  [ hdf_rms ] .",
    "a s / n map was made by dividing the flux map by the error map .",
    "source identification was performed in the s / n map .",
    "s / n peaks calculated from eq .",
    "[ beamwflux ] and eq .",
    "[ beamwerror ] are peaks of minimum @xmath48 . in principal , these peaks could be considered as candidate detections and their fluxes and errors could be measured in the flux and error maps . however , especially for faint sources , the fluxes measured in this way may be altered by the sidelobes of nearby sources .",
    "there are several ways to solve this problem .",
    "the simplest approach is to remove bright sources from the map before fluxes of fainter sources are measured .",
    "we note that the sources with high s / n are also the brighter ones locally .",
    "therefore , we first measured the flux of the highest s / n peak and removed the corresponding psf to 1.5 @xmath1 from the sky map at the s / n peak location . the amount of flux removed and the location of the s / n peak were recorded .",
    "this location of the s / n peak is used as the source position in the final catalog .",
    "then we recalculated the flux map and the s / n map from the residual sky map to identify and remove the next highest s / n peak .",
    "we repeated this until the s / n was less than 3.0 everywhere .",
    "the depth of source removal was 1.5 @xmath1 , i.e. , there was 1.5 @xmath1 residual flux on the sky map after each source was removed .",
    "we observed that if values @xmath50 @xmath1 ( the flux uncertainty ) were used , errors grew rapidly and some `` new sources '' would be created .",
    "because not all of the fluxes were removed , we measured the fluxes of all identified sources in the final residual flux map and added these fluxes back to the cataloged fluxes . the procedure above reduces the interference of nearby sources to @xmath51 @xmath1 because the 1.5 @xmath1 flux limit leaves a 0.8 @xmath1 residual flux in the sidelobes . for sources that do not fall exactly on each other s sidelobes",
    ", the residual interference would be even smaller and thus negligible .",
    "the source catalog constructed in this way is presented in table  [ tab1 ] and figure  [ hdf_sources ] .",
    "a total of 17 sources are detected at @xmath52 .",
    "only sources detected above this significance level should be considered as secure detections . at lower significance , many of the sources will be real , but some will correspond to noise peaks .",
    "there are a further 28 sources between 3 @xmath1 and 4 @xmath1 . in   [ n_counts ] we estimated the number of spurious detections caused by noise to be @xmath53 to 10 in the 3.0 - 4.0 @xmath1 range , and most of these are in the 3.0 - 3.5 @xmath1 range .",
    "for the 10 sources in the 3.5 - 4.0 @xmath1 range we expect @xmath54 is a spurious source .",
    "the procedure described above assumes isolated point - like sources .",
    "however , there might be extended sources or multiple blended sources which are marginally resolved .",
    "it is also possible that the psf of a detected source is damaged by a noisy bolometer . for such sources ,",
    "the psfs are not point - like .",
    "one example is goods 850 - 13 . after it was removed from the map , another significant peak ( goods 850 - 23 ) still existed in its neighborhood .",
    "another example is source goods 850 - 6 .",
    "this source happened to fall close to a bad bolometer during the observations .",
    "its observed psf is altered by that bolometer and shows two peaks ( figure  1 ) , though still consistent with a single source .",
    "being aware of this , we also list fluxes measured within @xmath34 diameter apertures in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "sources with aperture fluxes significantly greater than the beam - optimized fluxes ( e.g. , goods 850 - 5 , 6 , 13 , and 16 ) may be marginally resolved by the telescope beam or affected by noisy bolometers .",
    "we caution that for such sources , the cataloged multiples should not be considered as a unique configuration of the flux distribution . the exact source shape and multiplicity",
    "can only be revealed by optical / near - ir or radio identifications , or by submillimeter interferometric imaging .",
    "in addition to the direct source extraction described above , another method to solve the sidelobe interference is to deconvolve the map with the telescope beam , as most radio astronomers do .",
    "we performed standard clean deconvolution on our map , also based on beam - optimized fluxes . in our clean deconvolution , the highest s / n",
    "peak was identified and a small portion ( @xmath55 to @xmath56 ) of its flux was removed ( cleaned ) from the sky map .",
    "the next flux map was then constructed from the residual sky map and the next highest s / n peak was cleaned , and so on .",
    "each time when some flux was cleaned , the flux and the location were recorded in a catalog .",
    "the clean was stopped after the s /",
    "n on the map was @xmath57 everywhere .",
    "there is a difference between our clean and the normal clean used in most radio astronomy .",
    "our clean removes sources at the beam - optimized s / n peaks while normal clean removes sources at the peaks on the sky map . given the low s / n of the scuba map ( @xmath58 for most sources ) and the very non - uniform sensitivity , we believe that our method provides more reliable results .",
    "it is apparent that the direct extraction method in   [ direct_extract ] is a simplified clean ",
    "it removes the flux of a source at once , instead of just removing a small portion of the flux .",
    "indeed , the catalog generated by the clean deconvolution is in excellent agreement with table  [ tab1 ] , and there is no point in listing it separately .",
    "the only differences between the clean catalog and table  [ tab1 ] are in the marginally resolved sources . for these sources ,",
    "the direct extraction provided a configuration that has the fewest point - like components , while clean generated many faint point sources within an area comparable to the beam size .",
    "again , we caution that for marginally resolved sources , both the direct extraction results and the clean results are approximate models for the flux distribution .",
    "neither of them provides a unique deconvolution solution .",
    "the hdf and its flanking fields have been investigated at 850 @xmath0 m with scuba by several other groups . in this section ,",
    "we compare our source catalog with the ones in these surveys .",
    "@xcite and @xcite surveyed the hdf - proper area using the jiggle mode of scuba .",
    "their survey covered an area of @xmath59 arcmin@xmath3 with @xmath60 to 1.5 mjy sensitivity .",
    "our map of the hdf - proper region made use of a subset of the observations of @xcite and @xcite but with independent data reduction .",
    "we compared our catalog and the catalog in @xcite to look for systematic differences in flux calibration and astrometry .",
    "figure  [ hdf_sources ] shows sources in the two catalogs . among the seven detected sources in table  1 of @xcite , six were recovered by us , despite the fact that we only included @xmath61 of the hdf - proper archival data .",
    "we failed to detect their source hdf850.6 even though our map at its location is deeper than that of @xcite .",
    "hdf850.7 was detected in our map , but with a @xmath62 offset . because hdf850.6 and hdf850.7 are both at the map edge of @xcite , where the noise is significantly higher , the disagreement between the two catalogs on these sources is not unusual .",
    "excluding hdf850.6 and hdf850.7 , the mean positional offset between the two catalogs is @xmath63 and the offsets appear to have random directions ( see figure  [ hdf_sources ] ) .",
    "the mean flux difference between the two catalogs is 4% .",
    "we conclude that our analysis is consistent with that of @xcite and that there is no systematic difference between our catalog and the @xcite catalog in terms of flux calibration and astrometry .",
    "we note that hdf850.3 was detected by @xcite but not by @xcite and us .",
    "hdf850.3 is located between the negative sidelobes of goods 850 - 10 and 19 .",
    "after goods 850 - 10 and 19 were removed from the map , we found a very marginal signal ( @xmath64 mjy ) at the position of hdf850.3 .",
    "this flux is only 50% of that in @xcite .",
    "although it is not qualified as a detection here , hdf850.3 may be a real source .",
    "barger et al .  ( 2000 ) published jiggle maps targeting optically faint microjansky radio sources in the flanking fields of the hdf @xcite .",
    "their reduced maps are included in this paper and re - analyzed .",
    "there are a few differences between barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and this work . some regions in barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have been further deepened after the publication .",
    "the noise estimates of barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were based on cleaned maps where confusion sources fainter than 3 @xmath1 were not removed , while in this work the noise estimates are free from faint sources . because of these , sources detected here generally have smaller errors . in barger",
    "et al.(2000 ) , submm fluxes were measured at radio positions , which are not necessarily flux peaks in the submm map .",
    "there are eight sources with 850 @xmath0 m s / n greater than 2.7 cataloged in barger et al .",
    "( 2000 , see figure  [ hdf_sources ] ) .",
    "all of them are detected in this work with s / n greater than 4.0 , mostly because of the increase in depth .",
    "for these eight sources , the fluxes are in good agreement and the mean flux ratio ( barger et al .",
    "2000 to this work ) is @xmath65 .",
    "the slight flux boost in this work can be explained by the fact that the submm fluxes were measured at flux peaks instead of the radio positions .",
    "@xcite used the scan mode of scuba to survey a 125 arcmin@xmath3 area with @xmath66 mjy 1 @xmath1 sensitivity in the flanking fields of the hdf .",
    "our jiggle map has a survey area comparable to that of the scan map but with sensitivity up to 3 times higher .",
    "the difference between our jiggle map and the scan map of @xcite is quite large , even at the 4 @xmath1 level .",
    "all 12 scan - map sources have fluxes @xmath67 mjy , and ten are well inside our survey area ( see figure  [ hdf_sources ] ) .",
    "however , only three scan - map sources in table  1 of @xcite were detected by our jiggle map and these had fairly large positional offsets .",
    "they are hdfsmm3608@xmath681246 ( associated with our source goods 850 - 8 ) , 3620@xmath681701 ( goods 850 - 15 ) , and 3644@xmath681452 ( goods 850 - 11 ) .",
    "the offsets between the scan - map and the jiggle - map source positions are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the offsets seem to have random directions ( see figure  [ hdf_sources ] ) . on average ,",
    "the scan - map fluxes of the three sources are @xmath71 greater than the jiggle - map fluxes .",

    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "only the three sources mentioned above were detected at @xmath4 @xmath1 .",
    "we also looked for jiggle - map sources within @xmath34 ( @xmath72 the beam fwhm ) centered at the scan - map source positions .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab2 ] , except for the three detections , all jiggle - map sources found have either fluxes that are too low ( @xmath73 of the scan - map fluxes ) or offsets that are too large to be associated with the scan - map sources .",
    "we conclude that only three of the ten scan - map sources within our field - of - view were detected in the jiggle map .",
    "this is a surprising result because our jiggle map is considerably deeper than the scan map .",
    "if the scan - map sources were all real , then our jiggle map should have detected most of them .",
    "furthermore , we note that two very bright jiggle - map sources were not detected by the scan - map .",
    "they are goods 850 - 6 and 16 .",
    "goods 850 - 6 has a jiggle - map flux of 13.6 mjy at @xmath74 @xmath1 .",

    "there is a @xmath77 @xmath0jy 1.4 ghz source @xcite associated with this source .",
    "in terms of the 850 @xmath0 m s / n ratios and the fir  radio correlation , these two jiggle - map sources are highly significant .",
    "both sources are within the scan - map field - of - view , but neither are detected by the scan - map .",

    "the upper cutoff produces a turn - over on the bright - end counts ( see figure  [ sim_counts ] ) . however , the 25 mjy value used here is not important because there are not enough sources at this flux level to tightly constrain the upper cutoff .",
