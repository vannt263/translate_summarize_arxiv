    "many astrophysical and cosmological observations have shown that cold dark matter ( dm ) occupies @xmath0 of the universe , while the baryons only occupy @xmath1 , and the rest is dark energy @xcite . a potential candidate for cold dm",
    "is the so - called weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) @xcite .",
    "wimps can annihilate or decay to protons / antiprotons , electrons / positrons , and @xmath2-rays etc . , which applies an indirect way to search for dm signals .",
    "an excess of electrons and positrons have been observed by pamela @xcite and ams02 @xcite .",
    "this anomalous excess may be produced by dm annihilation , but it is hard to confirm because the charged particles are deflected by the magnetic fields and the propagation is complex .",
    "therefore , compared with charged particle , @xmath2-ray is a better approach to investigate dm .",
    "wimps annihilation can directly produce @xmath2-rays , or indirectly produce @xmath2-rays through the cascade decay , final state radiation , and inverse compton scattering process .",
    "these @xmath2-rays should be mainly generated in the regions with high dm density , and then be captured by the detectors , such as the space - borne @xmath2-ray detector fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) @xcite .",
    "many works have finished to investigate the @xmath2-rays in some astrophysical objects with high dm density , for instance , the galactic halo @xcite , galaxy clusters @xcite , and galactic dm substructures . in the galactic center , the @xmath2-ray excess @xcite origin from dm annihilation is still unconfirmed , because there are too many astrophysical sources causing a complicated backgrounds .",
    "but the nearby dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dsphs ) are the ideal candidates in probing @xmath2-rays from dm annihilation because on the one hand they have high dm density and on the other hand they are lack of conventional astrophysical @xmath2-ray sources .",
    "more than twenty dsphs have been discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , which has a deep and systematic coverage on the northern celestial hemisphere .",
    "numerous studies have been performed to search for @xmath2-ray emission among thees dsphs , but no significant signal has been found @xcite . as a southern - hemisphere optical instrument , the ongoing dark energy survey ( des ) @xcite , has released @xmath3 new dsphs in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "some works have been done in searching for @xmath2-ray emissions among these new candidates by fermi - lat .",
    "no significant signal has been found , except two candidates reticulum ii and tuc iii , showing a very weak suspected @xmath2-ray gev excess @xcite .",
    "but there is a controversy about the @xmath2-ray excess in the direction of reticulum ii .",
    "compared with the pass 8 data , the @xmath2-ray excess from reticulum ii based on pass 7 data analysis is more significant @xcite .",
    "the fermi - lat collaboration declare that this difference is because of the improvement of data pass 8 compared with pass 7 @xcite .",
    "the newly discovered dsphs have been surveyed as point - like sources in looking for @xmath2-ray signals , due to the lack of spatial extension information of dm halo . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the astrophysical factor versus integration angle of reticulum ii has been performed , which can be used to deduce the spatial extension information . in this study",
    ", we search for possible @xmath2-ray emission from reticulum ii , supposing it is either a point - like source or an extended source with different spatial extension .",
    "we also study the constraints on the dm annihilation cross sections from the fermi - lat observation of reticulum ii .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze the fermi - lat data in the direction of reticulum ii with different spatial extension and give out the upper limits of energy flux . in sec .",
    "iii , we constrain the dm annihilation cross section by the @xmath2-ray emission observation of reticulum ii . sec .",
    "iv is the summary .",
    "our work is based on the science tools version v10r0p5 .",
    "we employ approximately 7-year fermi - lat data recorded from august 2008 to june 2015 with the pass 8 photon data selection in the analysis .",
    "the events from the pass 8 source - class in the energy band between 500 mev and 500 gev are adopted . in order to reduce the @xmath2-ray contamination from the earth limb , the events with zenith angles larger than @xmath5",
    "are rejected , and the recommended filter cut @xmath6 are applied .",
    "we create @xmath7 square region as the roi around the dsph center into @xmath8 pixels and 8 logarithmical bins of energy from 500 mev to 500 gev .",
    "we use the galactic @xmath2-ray diffuse model @xmath9 and the isotropic extragalactic @xmath2-ray diffuse spectrum @xmath10 as the diffuse background .",
    "the third lat source catalog ( 3fgl ) @xcite is taken to deal with the point @xmath2-ray sources . in the analysis",
    ", we carry out a global fit over the entire energy range and then fix all the background sources ( both point - like and diffuse ) in each energy bin .",
    "the instrument response functions ( irfs ) @xmath11 have been set corresponding to the above lat data selection .    within each energy bin ,",
    "the putative @xmath2-ray signal of dsph reticulum ii is modeled as power - law ( @xmath12 ) with spectral index of @xmath13 .",

    "the test statistic ( ts ) value of @xmath2-ray emission signal excess over background can be obtained by comparing the likelihood values with and without additional @xmath2-ray source .",
    "we find that in the set of dm mass we selected , the dm mass with 25 gev annihilation to @xmath31 channel contributes the most significant excess , although the significance is only about @xmath35 . in this case",

    "in spite of no significant @xmath2-ray emission excess from the direction of reticulum ii was found , the dm annihilation cross section upper limits can be deduced .",
    "we derive the dm annihilation cross section from reticulum ii via @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 channels .",
    "the expected integrated @xmath2-ray signature flux from dsph dm annihilation can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section , @xmath38 is the dm mass , @xmath39 is the differential @xmath2-ray spectrum in one dm pair annihilation , and @xmath14 is the astrophysical factor expressed as eq .",
