    "this lecture is meant to give a global overview of effective field theories .",
    "the first part of the lecture in an introduction to the basic idea and a tutorial on the matching procedure , all discussed within the context of a simple toy scalar model .",
    "i then categorize the various types of effective field theories into two main headings depending upon whether the theory admits a perturbative matching procedure .",
    "most of the rest of the lecture is dedicated to some sample theories where we can match .",
    "i will assume throughout these lectures that the reader has a basic understanding of renormalization .",
    "let us now try to be more quantitative by starting with a simple toy model .",
    "what we would like to illustrate is that all the effects of ultra - violet ( uv ) physics may be absorbed into local counter - terms and furthermore , that all of the physical effects of the uv physics are suppressed by powers of the uv scale .",
    "to do so we will work with a model of two scalar fields , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , in four dimensions .",
    "the interaction lagrangian will be given by @xmath8 it is typical , in most pedagogical treatises , to impose a discrete symmetry to forbid tri - linear interactions , as such terms introduce dimensionful couplings , which complicate the systematics .",
    "however , such interactions will illuminate certain ideas which otherwise would not arise until higher orders in the loop expansion .",
    "the usual problems with tri - linear theories arise from issues of vacuum stability , but for our purposes these issues will not be an obstruction .",
    "i will assume that all the couplings , except for @xmath9 , take on their  natural values \" . here",
    "i use the term  natural \" in both the sense of dirac and thooft .",
    "that is , dimensionless couplings should be of order one ( dirac ) and dimensionful couplings should be of order of the largest scale in the problem , unless a symmetry arises in the limit when the coupling vanishes ( thooft ) .",
    "thus , we take @xmath10 and @xmath11 . furthermore , since there is no symmetry protecting the light scalar mass , choosing @xmath12 is unnatural , but this is just an aesthetic issue with which we wo nt be bothered .    now , according to the arguments in the previous section , it should be possible to write down a local theory involving only the light degrees of freedom which correctly reproduces the physics of the full theory as long as we only consider external momenta much less than @xmath13 .",
    "the process of determining the low energy theory is called  matching \" , and the strategy is quite simple .",
    "we build up our low energy theory , which only involves the light fields , such that it reproduces the full theory up to some orders in @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the external momentum of the process under consideration which we will take to be of order @xmath9 . doing this is quite simple in practice .",
    "the effective theory action will be given by the full theory action with all heavy fields set to zero plus some new terms which account for the effects of the heavy fields .",
    "the additional terms are determined order by order in perturbation theory by calculating some amputated greens function in the full and effective theories and taking the difference @xmath17 in a sense what the left hand side of this equation is telling you is exactly what the effective theory is missing .",
    "since the effective theory is designed to reproduce the ir physics of the full theory , @xmath18 will have a well defined taylor expansion around @xmath19 .",
    "thus the holes in the effective theory can be plugged by adding local operators . if this seems a little obscure at this point do nt worry as we will discuss many concrete examples of this matching procedure below .",
    "notice that matching each n - point function will generate distinct local operators in the effective theory , with higher n - point functions obviously generating higher dimensional operators .",
    "thus the number of n - point function one needs to calculate depends upon the desired accuracy .",
    "the more accuracy we want the more operators we must keep , as each operator of successively higher dimension will be suppressed by additional powers of the uv scale .",
    "let s see how this works in our toy theory .",
    "consider the amputated four point function for the light fields . at tree level , there are four diagrams which contribute to this process .",
    "one is the usual contribution involving only the light fields gives @xmath20 , and the other three have intermediate heavy scalars as shown in figure ( [ tree ] ) .",
    "these latter contributions are given by @xmath21    after expanding ( [ fig1 ] ) we can see that the four point function can be reproduced , up to corrections of order @xmath22 by using @xmath23 here i have established notation for the coefficients ( called  wilson coefficients \" ) , the subscript counts the number of fields while the superscripts denote the order in the expansion in coupling and derivatives ( more generally powers of @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we can now see clearly what was emphasized in the introduction .",
    "as far as a low energy observer is concerned this looks like a simple @xmath25 theory with a coupling that we had to fix via experiment anyway .",
    "the low energy observer would be completely oblivious to the uv physics unless the experiment were sensitive enough to see the deviations from @xmath25 theory due to @xmath26 corrections .",
    "if we wanted to , we could add additional operators to ensure that we correctly reproduce the higher n point functions as well .",
    "suppose the low energy observer upgrades the machine , either by raising the energy or luminosity , to the point where the data can no longer be fit by pure @xmath27 theory .",
    "we know exactly what to do to correctly reproduce the data , simply add the higher derivative interaction @xmath28 other operators with two derivatives and four fields can all be put into the form above via integration by parts and use of the equation of motion . that this latter manipulation is allowed will be discussed later .",
    "as the energy of the experiment is further raised one needs to include higher and higher derivative interactions to reproduce the data .",
    "notice that until we get to high enough energies to actually produce the heavy scalar we will be in the dark as to the true underlying theory .",
    "this is because in principle there will be an equivalence class ( called a \" `  universality class \" ) of theories which look the same in the infra - red .",
    "as we fit more and more of the couplings of the higher dimension operators we would be able to eliminate theories , but removing all ambiguities would be difficult without including some other selection criteria .",
    "so far , we ve shown that to tree level we can reproduce the full theory by adjusting coefficients in an effective lagrangian , this is called  matching \" .",
    "this matching procedure can be carried out to arbitrary order in the couplings and @xmath26 . indeed , suppose we wish to match at higher orders in the couplings .",
    "the matching procedure now takes on a new twist , but the idea is the same .",
    "we taylor expand the full theory result and compare it to the result in the effective theory .",
    "we then modify the effective theory so as to get the answer right .",
    "i should mention at this point that in most theories the loop and coupling expansions coincide .",
    "but in our toy model , because of the @xmath29 coupling this is no longer true .",
    "nonetheless we can overcome this issue by assuming that ( @xmath30 ) is of order @xmath31 . in this way all tree level contributions are of order @xmath32 .",
    "this is why i labelled the wilson coefficient above @xmath33 .",
    "returning to our calculation , let us see if we can reproduce the full theory at next order in the couplings , beginning with the two point function .",
    "there are two leading order ( dimension four ) operators which get renormalized when calculating the two point function .",
    "the mass @xmath34 and the kinetic energy @xmath35 .",
    "the one loop contributions to the two point function are shown in figure ( [ 2point ] ) .",
    "diagram 2a . is the usual contribution found in @xmath25 theory and is given by @xmath36 where i will use the notation @xmath37 the diagram in 2c .",
    "gives the same result as 2a . , but with the replacement @xmath38 .",
    "both of these contributions are momentum independent and thus only renormalize the mass .",
    "figure 2b , on the other hand , will have non - trivial momentum dependence . we expect to have a cut beginning at @xmath39 , and thus this contribution will be analytic in the neighborhood @xmath40 . doing the one - loop integration gives @xmath41 where i have expanded in @xmath42 , and kept only the leading term .",
    "finally , there is a contribution from the tadpole diagram 2d . which is given by @xmath43 now let s calculate in the effective theory .",
    "we must note that to be consistent we must use the @xmath44 effective lagrangian which we generated at tree level when we calculate on the effective theory side ( the aforementioned twist ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the tree level matching where there is nothing to calculate on the effective theory side . at leading order in @xmath42 ,",
    "the only relevant operator is the @xmath45 term and so we find that the effective theory gives the same result as fig 2a . except now",
    "the coupling is not @xmath46 but @xmath47 . to match we take the renormalized ( here in @xmath48 ) full theory result expanded around small ( @xmath49 ) , and subtract the renormalized effective theory result , finding @xmath50 . \\nonumber",
    "\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to insure that perturbation theory is well behaved , we should choose @xmath51 to minimize the large logs .",
    "this scale is called the  matching scale \" .",
    "intuitively we would think that this scale should be the high scale @xmath13 .",
    "given that the effective theory is supposed to reproduce the infrared physics , we would expect that all the dependence on the low energy parameter @xmath9 should be identical on both sides of the matching equation , thus leaving all logs in the matching independent of @xmath9 .",
    "however a glance at our results shows that choosing @xmath52 does not get rid of all the large logs .",
    "clearly we have done something wrong .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that we have kept some terms which we had no business keeping .",
    "in particular , diagram 2d . is power suppressed relative ( remember that @xmath29 scales as @xmath13 ) to the other diagrams .",
    "thus , to be consistent we need to expand our full theory result for diagram 2b . to one more order .",
    "so we make the replacement @xmath53 the log term will exactly kill off all of the large logs in @xmath54 , leaving @xmath55 notice that this correction wants to pull up the light scalar mass to the scale @xmath13 since @xmath56 .",
    "this is just what we called  unnatural \" in the sense of thooft , since as @xmath9 is taken to zero we do not enhance the symmetry . keeping @xmath12 will require a fine tuning of the counter - terms at each order in perturbation . in the @xmath48 scheme this wo nt show up until we try to relate the @xmath48 mass to the physical mass .",
    "that is , there will be a relation of the form @xmath57 and we will need to delicately choose @xmath58 to cancel the large @xmath59 piece .    the momentum dependent terms will simply shift the field normalization in the effective theory with @xmath60 . if we wish to go to higher orders in the @xmath42 expansion we will generate the operator @xmath61 .3 in * exercise 1.1 * : calculate @xmath62 .3 in    now let us consider the four point function .",
    "a partial list of the relevant full theory diagrams are shown in figure 3.the diagrams with external leg corrections will automatically be reproduced by the effective theory , since we already matched the two point function . in the effective theory , there will be only one diagram , and it is identical to 3c .",
    "except that at each vertex we use the coupling @xmath47 . by considering the combination of couplings coming from @xmath63 , we can begin to see that we will indeed reproduce 3a , 3b and 3c .",
    "however , we can also see that this diagram will not be able to reproduce the log of @xmath9 from figure 3e . to match this log",
    "we will have to first reproduce the six point function at tree level .",
    "then diagram 3e . will be reproduced by tying together two external legs .",
    "you can see how this will happen by noting that heavy field propagators can be contracted to a point in the full theory graph .",
    "figure 3d will have no partner in the effective theory and will contribute ( in the s channel ) , after renormalization and expansion in @xmath64 , @xmath65 we see that since we are matching at the scale @xmath52 , this diagram will not contribute to @xmath66 , at least in the @xmath48 scheme .",
    "the other channels give similar contributions .",
    ".3 in * exercise 1.2 * first draw all the remaining diagrams which contribute to the four point function in the full theory .",
    "then show that all the dependence on @xmath67 cancels in the matching for the four point function .",
    "hint : by working at zero external momentum the calculation greatly simplifies .",
    ".3 in    what happens if we go to first order in @xmath22 , staying at one loop ? at this order",
    "when we calculate in the effective theory , we will need to include the graph depicted in figure 4 , where the circle represents an insertion of the operator ( [ deriv ] ) .",
    "the integral for this feynman diagram will have a contribution which is quadratically divergent @xmath68    now , suppose we regulate this divergence with a cut - off , then this contribution will scale as @xmath69 .",
    "what order is this in our momentum expansion ?",
    "if it s order one , it would seem that we have lost all hope of calculating in a systematic fashion , since no matter how many powers of @xmath13 may suppress a given operator , it may give an order one contribution if we stick it into a multi - loop diagram .",
    "this would be a disaster .",
    "however , this reasoning is misleading . the fact that something ca nt be right",
    "can be immediately seen by working with a different regulator .",
    "suppose we work in dimensional regularization . in this scheme ,",
    "there are no power divergence as they are automatically set to zero @xcite .",
    "it had better not be that our answer depends on our choice of regulator , otherwise we re clearly lost .",
    "so what s going on ? which regulator is giving us the correct result ?",
    "the answer is , both .",
    "the difference between the two is  pure counter - term \" , which means the discrepancy in the two results can be accounted for by a shift in the couplings of local operators . since the couplings are _ measured _ , and not predicted , there is no physical distinction between the two results .",
    "the only difference is in the bookkeeping , that is , the counter - terms in the two schemes differ but that s it .",
    "the nice thing about dimensional regularization is that we do nt have to worry about mixing orders in @xmath42 .",
    "we can see that if we use a cut - off and take it to be of order @xmath13 , then operators which are formally suppressed will  mix up \" with operators of lower dimension .",
    "but if we stick to dimensional regularization , then powers of @xmath42 are explicit , as they only appear in coefficients of operators ( modulo the caveat about @xmath29 in our toy theory ) , so we can read off the order of a loop diagram immediately . thus ,",
    "in general it is wiser to always work in  dim . reg . \" when doing effective field theory calculations .",
    "this is not to say that the cut - off does nt have its time and place . in particular",
    "the cut - off makes quadratic divergences explicit , whereas in dim .",
    "they show up as poles in lower dimensions .",
    "another interesting point which arises from the calculation of the diagrams in figure 4 is the fact that there are divergences which can only be subtracted using counter - terms for operators with dimensions greater than four .",
    "the effective theory is non - renormalizable , an anathema in ancient times .",
    "that is , there are new uv divergences in the effective theory that arise in each order of perturbation theory .",
    "these divergences were not there in the full theory .",
    "this should not surprise us , since the effective theory is only built to mock up the ir of the full theory , not the uv .",
    "thus the uv divergences will not cancel in the matching .",
    "this is nt a problem , we simply choose a scheme , and subtract . in the effective field theory approach we should be careful with out choice of scheme .",
    "if we re not careful we could mess up our power counting by introducing a scale .",
    "so we should choose a nice simple mass independent scheme like @xmath48 .",
    "i will have more to say about this later on in these lectures .",
    "notice that the matching coefficient will clearly be prescription dependent , but any such prescription dependence will drop out in low energy predictions .",
    ".2 in    * exercise 1.3 * calculate the anomalous dimensions of the dimension six operator @xmath70 to one loop .",
    "the additional uv divergences which arise in the effective theory correspond to ir divergences in the full theory .",
    "this is easily understood from the fact that we have taken @xmath13 to infinity in the effective theory .",
    "so the `` ir '' divergence @xmath71 now looks uv .",
    "thus effective field theory allows us to resum ir logs in a simple way using standard renormalization group techniques .",
    "we will see an example of this in the coming sections .",
    ".3 in      before moving on i d like to discuss one more technical aspect of matching .",
    "in particular , it s important to understand that it does nt matter whether or not one chooses to match with external states on - shell or off - shell .",
    "the reason is that putting external lines off - shell only changes the ir behavior of the theory , and since the effective theory is designed to reproduce the non - analytic structure of the full theory , all the information regarding the virtuality of the external lines cancels in the matching .",
    "this can greatly reduce the amount of work one has to do to match .",
    "for instance , if one is not interested in matching operators with derivatives , then one could choose the external momenta to vanish identically , greatly simplifying the necessary integrals .",
    "also if one matches off - shell one can induce operators in the effective theory which vanish by the leading order equations of motion .",
    "for example , in our toy model we could induce @xmath72 .",
    "however , it is quite simple to show that we can eliminate this operator via a field redefinition , which are known to leave s - matrix elements unchanged due to the equivalence theorem@xcite .",
    "the proof @xcite is inductive .",
    "suppose we have set all operators of order @xmath73 which vanish by the leading order equations of motion ( by leading order i m referring to the momentum expansion ) to zero .",
    "if there exists an operator at order @xmath74 of the form @xmath75 , then we make the field redefinition @xmath76 so that variation of the leading order lagrangian @xmath77 exactly cancels the offending term .",
    "notice that since @xmath78 is order @xmath79 in the derivative expansion the lower order operators remain unchanged but we do induce a change in the subleading set of operators , i.e. at order @xmath80 .",
    "however , since in an effective theory we generate all possible operators consistent with the symmetries , all this redefinition will do is to shift the value of some matching coefficients .",
    "let us consider the case of a chiral gauge theory .",
    "these are theories for which a fermion mass term is disallowed by gauge invariance . we know",
    "that if the theory is to be unitary and gauge invariant , the particle content must be such that all the gauge anomalies arising from triangle diagrams sum to zero .",
    "the classic example of such a theory is the standard model itself , where the fermions get their masses from the higgs yukawa couplings .",
    "taking the fermion masses large while holding the symmetry breaking scale fixed corresponds to the limit of a large yukawa coupling @xmath81 .",
    "since the coupling is proportional to the mass , we might expect that low energy observables ( below the scale of symmetry breaking ) could be enhanced by a large mass .",
    "the classic example of this `` non - decoupling '' arises in @xmath82 mixing . after integrating out the top quark",
    "one generates a term in the @xmath83 hamiltonian @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a four quark operator .",
    "a similar effect shows up in the @xmath86 parameter , which is a measure of the ratio of charged to neutral currents . these effects would disappear in the limit where the bottom and top quark become degenerate , the former vanishes as a consequence of the gim mechanism .",
    "both of these effects arise due to @xmath87 breaking .",
    "if we took the limit where both the bottom and the top quark masses become equal and large , then we would expect that the effects of this heavy pair could all be absorbed into @xmath87 symmetric operators .",
    "the thoughtful reader might be confused by this last statement if they are familiar with anomalies .",
    "suppose that one of the @xmath88 doublets is much heavier than the weak scale , and we wish to integrate it out .",
    "the low energy theory would then have anomalous matter content and would apparently no longer be gauge invariant . actually things can look even worse .",
    "if we start with an even number of @xmath88 doublets and integrate out one such pair , then naively , the partition function would vanish due to the non - perturbative anomaly @xcite .. and a topologically non - trivial gauge transformation multiply the partition function by a factor of -1 for each @xmath88 doublet .",
    "] now it should not come as no surprise that at `` low energies '' we do not have manifest gauge invariance . nor should we be worried about this fact , since the lack of gauge invariance will only manifest itself in a pernicious way ( a breakdown of unitarity ) at energies near the masses of the gauge bosons .",
    "nonetheless we should be able to add a tower of higher dimensional operators which will allow us to calculate sensibly at energies above the masses of the gauge bosons .",
    "the question is , what scale suppresses the effects of the fermions in these higher dimensional operators ?",
    "the answer is the symmetry breaking scale @xmath89 , and not the mass of the fermion . integrating out a heavy fermion will generate a set of higher dimensional operators such as those arising from the graph in figure ( [ dim6 ] ) .",
    "this graph will generate a whole string of operators once we expand it in momentum .",
    "consider the contribution to the dimension 6 operators , which are suppressed by @xmath90 .",
    "just from counting vertices and dimensional analysis we see that it must scale as @xmath91 .",
    "thus we ca nt write down a local effective theory which is valid in the region @xmath92 , at least with these variables .",
    "the trouble all starts from the fact that fermions are getting their relatively large masses from dimensionless couplings .",
    "even so , we should be able to calculate in a reliable fashion up to the scale @xmath89 even with our low energy theory which appears anomalous .",
    "imagine we re taking the limit @xmath93 so that there is a large hierarchy between @xmath94 and @xmath89 , and we wish to calculate in this window .",
    "how can we recover a sensible theory without the heavy fermion pair ?",
    "the answer is via a `` wess - zumino '' term @xcite . in the present context",
    "the generation of this term was worked out in a series of papers by dhoker and farhi , which i will only briefly summarize .",
    "the serious student may wish to spend some time looking at the original work @xcite .    if we allow for @xmath95 , then",
    "the heavy fermions will be strongly coupled , but this should not stop us from matching onto an effective theory . we know that we will not be able to match perturbatively .",
    "however , the large @xmath96 limit lends itself naturally to a derivative expansion which will keep our matching under control .",
    "we will simplify the problem by considering a toy yukawa theory with @xmath97 symmetry .",
    "the field content is a left ( right ) handed fermion in the fundamental and a higgs in the bi - fundamental , which transform as @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 are independent elements of @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "the addition of gauge fields complicates things only slightly .",
    "the action for the model is given by @xmath103 where the higgs doublet , @xmath104 is written as @xmath105 , with @xmath106 being a unitary matrix .",
    "that is we have frozen the modulus of the higgs field to simplify the problem . allowing the modulus to fluctuate wo nt change our conclusions .",
    "now we would like to match on to an effective theory without the heavy fermions .",
    "the matching involves only calculations in the full theory since the are no graphs in the effective theory .",
    "if we were working in the standard model and wanted only to integrate out the top quark , this would no longer be true .",
    "thus matching corresponds to formally do the path integral over the fermions then expanding the effective action @xmath107",
    "d[\\psi_r]exp\\left(i\\int d^4x \\textsl{l}\\right)\\ ] ] in powers of @xmath108 , keeping only the terms which do not vanish in the @xmath109 limit . here",
    "i will only sketch how this calculation is done .",
    "the trick is to perform a change of variables to absorb the higgs field into a gauge field .",
    "this is accomplished by the redefinition @xmath110 which results in @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "the advantage of using this form is that a derivative expansion corresponds to an expansion in the number of external fields .",
    "we may write the new effective action defined in terms of an integral over the @xmath113 fields , as @xmath114 with @xmath115 since @xmath116=j(u ) [ dn_l].\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is the jacobian for the change of variables ( 23 ) .",
    "@xmath114 can be calculated using the usual feynman diagram techniques , and , in general , contains many interesting pieces , such as the famous `` goldstone - wilzcek '' current @xcite which can endow solitons with fermion number .",
    "however , in this model , all of these terms will be invariant under the anomalous symmetry , so we will not concern ourselves with them at present . we will be mostly concerned with the wess - zumino term which resides in the jacobian@xcite .",
    "this term can not be written as the four dimensional integral of an @xmath118 invariant density but can be written as an invariant five dimensional integral @xcite @xmath119.\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath120 is an arbitrary ( differentiable ) extension of @xmath106 into the @xmath121 direction which need only to satisfy @xmath122 the reason that the interpolation is arbitrary is that the integrand is invariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "moreover , under a small variation of @xmath120 , the integral is a total derivative whose value is fixed in terms of @xmath123 .",
    ".2 in * exercise 1.4 * prove that under small but arbitrary variations in @xmath120 , the wess - zumino term changes by a total derivative , and thus depends only on the vale of @xmath120 in four dimensional space - time .",
    ".2 in    if we were to include the gauge fields , then a variation of the wz term would exactly reproduce the usual @xmath124 contribution to the anomaly .",
    "it would also account for the non - perturbative anomaly @xcite in the case where the gauge group is @xmath87 .",
    "the result for the gauged theory can be found in @xcite , and is slightly more complicated then what i have described above .",
    "the non - local wz term can be expanded in powers of @xmath89 and the resulting theory will give well defined predictions in this standard model - like theory up to the scale @xmath89 .",
    "i will separate efts into two types . those for which the underlying uv physics is known and the matching can be done perturbatively , which i call  type i \" , and those for which it is not possible to match , either because the uv physics is unknown , or because matching is non - perturbative , which i will call  type ii \" .",
    "some examples of type ii theories for which the underlying theory is unknown are    * the standard model * einstein gravity * any higher dimensional gauge theory .    whereas for the following effective theories    * chiral perturbation theory : describes low energy pion interactions .",
    "* nucleon effective theory : describes the low energy interaction of nucleons @xcite .",
    "the underlying theory is just qcd , but the matching coefficients are not calculable , at least perturbatively .",
    "examples of type i theories are    * four fermi theory : for low energy weak interactions . in this case",
    "the underlying theory is the standard model , which in itself is a type ii theory . *",
    "heavy quark effective theory : describes mesons with one heavy quark@xcite .",
    "* non - relativistic effective theories ( nrqed , nrqcd ) : for non - relativistic bound states such as onia or atomic physics @xcite . * soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) : for large light - like interactions such as those in heavy to light quark transitions @xcite , high energy jet processes@xcite or quarkonia decays @xcite .    for type i theories , one may ask the question :  why bother with an effective theory when we know the complete theory ? \" .",
    "the answer is that in general the full theory can be quite complicated and going to an effective theory simplifies matters greatly . in particular , going to an effective theory can manifest approximate symmetries that are hidden in the full theory and , as we know , increased symmetry means increased predictive power . furthermore , when the full theory contains several disparate scales @xmath125 perturbation theory can be poorly behaved as typically one generates terms of the form @xmath126 . when these logs become large , they need to be resummed in a systematic fashion in order to keep perturbation theory under control . working within an effective theory",
    "simplifies the summation of these logs .",
    "the classic example of such a resummation arises in @xmath127 meson decays , which i will now explore .",
    "let us consider the decay of a free @xmath128 quark .",
    "this calculation is discussed in the text by peskin and schroeder @xcite using slightly different language , but i will sketch it here for the sake of completeness .",
    "i will also simplify it some by ignoring operator mixing . at first sight",
    "there is no reason to believe that free quark decay has anything to do with the actual meson decay , but we ll come back to that point later .    the tree level decay rate is proportional to the usual muon decay calculation , while at one loop we have diagrams such as those in figure 6a .",
    "this correction is finite and contains a large log of the form @xmath129 the diagrams which do not traverse the @xmath130 propagator do not contribute large logs and will not be of interest to us .",
    "if we are to save perturbation theory we must resum these logs .",
    "indeed , the perturbative series for a generic greens function of a theory which contains a large disparity of scales whose ratio is @xmath131 , will contain the series @xmath132 if we take @xmath133 to be order one , then we must resum all terms of the form @xmath134 .",
    "this is called the  leading log ( ll ) \" approximation .",
    "this resummation as well as the  next to leading log ( nll ) ( @xmath135 ) \" and so forth are easily performed once we work within the framework of eft .",
    "the way eft makes the resummation of the logs simple is by converting the problem to one with which we are more familiar .",
    "we know how to sum logs arising from uv divergences using the renormalization group ( rg ) , so all we need to do is to figure out how to relate the logs in ( [ ll ] ) to rg logs . the logs in ( [ ll ] ) can be thought of as ir logs in the @xmath136 goes to zero limit , or uv logs if we take @xmath94 to infinity .",
    "but this second limit is exactly the limit we take in constructing the eft . in the four - fermi theory @xmath94",
    "is taken formally to infinity , usually keeping only the first non - trivial term in the @xmath137 expansion .",
    "let us see how the four fermi theory reproduces the log in ( [ 1l ] ) .",
    "the loop correction in the effective theory corresponding to those in figure 6a is shown in figure 6b , and is given by @xmath138    note that without doing any calculation we could have guessed the coefficient of the log in the effective theory from the full theory result . since ,",
    "as we discussed in the context of our toy model , the effective theory must reproduce the ir physics of the full theory , so the logs of @xmath136 must be identical in both theories . using this result",
    "we may match onto the effective theory .",
    "the wilson coefficient of the four - fermi operator is @xmath139 notice that we work in a mass independent prescription ( usually @xmath140 where we subtract only the pole and possibly some dimensionless constants .",
    "thus , the constant in ( [ 4fmatch ] ) is _ scheme dependent_. however , this scheme dependence is order @xmath141 , which is sub - leading in the ll approximation . to cancel this @xmath141 scheme dependence",
    "we would need to go to the nll , where the shift in the two loop anomalous dimension , generated by shifting schemes , will account for the change in the matching coefficient .",
    "details of higher order calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    ".3 in * exercise 1.5 * prove that the anomalous dimension is scheme independent only up to one loop .",
    "also show that the beta function is scheme independent up to two loops .",
    "assume that the coupling in the new scheme is analytic in the coupling in the old scheme , that is @xmath142 .3 in    now in order to match we must make sure that series for @xmath143 is converging .",
    "thus we should choose @xmath51 to be order @xmath94 , in which case @xmath144 .",
    "in making this choice we have removed the large log from the matching , but if we are not careful the logs can still reappear . to see this we must consider the observable of interest . using the optical theorem we may write the @xmath127 meson decay rate as @xcite @xmath145 any @xmath51 dependence in the wilson coefficient",
    "must be cancelled by the @xmath51 dependence of the matrix element .",
    "if we choose @xmath51 to be order @xmath94 , then the matrix element will also be renormalized at this high scale .",
    "this would clearly be a blunder , since the physics responsible for the decay is all taking place at the scale @xmath136 .",
    "this blunder will reprise the log , since it will now show up in the matrix element as @xmath146 . to truly vanquish the log we want to renormalize the four fermi operator at the lower scale @xmath136 .",
    "but we know how to do this .",
    "we use the fact that the bare operator , @xmath147 , where @xmath148 includes both the operator and wave function renormalization , is @xmath51 independent @xmath149 then since @xmath150 @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the counter - term necessary to renormalize the four fermi operator , and @xmath153 is the fermionic wave function counter - term @xmath154 the solution to the rg equation for @xmath155 is @xmath156 leaving @xmath157^{(a_1/(2b_0))},\\ ] ] where @xmath158 is the leading order beta function coefficient @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "we are now free to evaluate the time order product , renormalized at the low scale @xmath136 without fear of generating large logs .",
    "note that we can not claim to be accurate at order @xmath161 .",
    "we can achieve this level of accuracy only if we run at two loops .",
    "since at order @xmath161 we must keep all terms of the form @xmath162 . thus keeping the constant in the matching",
    "really bought us nothing .",
    "the systematics follow the rule that to achieve accuracy at order @xmath163 , you must match at order @xmath163 and run at order @xmath79 .",
    "we have successfully removed that large and irrelevant scale @xmath94 from our calculation .",
    "doing so enabled us to easily sum the large logs .",
    "but we are not quite done removing scales . in the decay process itself",
    "there are two relevant scales , namely @xmath164 and @xmath165 , the scale of hadronic physics .",
    "so we would expect that in our matrix elements we could induce logs of the ratio of these scales .",
    "but this is not a large log , so should we bother integrating out the scale @xmath164 ?",
    "the answer is , of course , yes . because if you recall in the introduction to this section we said that effective field theories do much more than just sum logs .",
    "they make approximate symmetries manifest .    just as the scale @xmath94 was irrelevant for the decay process , so is @xmath164 . since @xmath166 , the quark effectively acts as a static color source . as far as the light degrees of freedom are concerned",
    ", the heavy quark is a brick wall .",
    "if you increased its mass , the effects on the bound state would be essentially nil .",
    "thus in the limit where the quark mass is taken to infinity , a new symmetry flavor symmetry emerges .",
    "if we have more than one quark with @xmath167 , then to leading order in @xmath168 , the quark decay is flavor independent .",
    "furthermore , the spin of the heavy quark should decouple since the color magnetic dipole moment scales inversely with the mass , so we would expect the emergence of a spin symmetry as well in the large mass limit .      in this section i will briefly introduce hqet .",
    "i wo nt go into detail as this is now textbook material @xcite .",
    "but some of the concepts inherent in this theory will be necessary for the second lecture , so i will briefly recap the highlights and refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "what we would like to do is eliminate the scale @xmath164 from the theory .",
    "however , we obviously need to keep the heavy quark field in the theory , so how do we keep the field and lose the mass ? we begin by studying the dynamics of a heavy meson decay . as i said above the heavy quark should be static up to corrections of order @xmath168 .",
    "we may write the heavy quark momentum as @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the quarks 4-velocity ( @xmath171 in the rest frame ) and @xmath172 is what s known as the  residual momentum \" which is of order @xmath173 . by studying the propagation of a heavy quark in a hadronic environment ,",
    "it is easy to illustrate that the heavy quarks only role is to be a static color source consider a heavy quark sitting inside a hadron being constantly bombarded by  soft \" gluons(i.e .",
    "gluons with momentum of order @xmath173 ) , as shown in figure ( [ hscat ] ) . in the large mass limit",
    "we may simplify the intermediate propagators as follows @xmath174    so that the dependence on the heavy quark mass has disappeared .",
    "we expect the mass only to appear at sub - leading order in the mass expansion , and in phase space integrals .",
    "furthermore , we also have @xmath175 so we may make the replacement @xmath176 and the spin structure becomes trivial . in the real world where we have effectively two heavy quarks with @xmath167 , charm and bottom , we can see that in the large mass limit we should generate an @xmath177 symmetry , and this symmetry should be manifest in our effective theory .    we can determine the action for the effective field theory by matching .",
    "we consider the full theory propagator , again splitting the momentum into a large and small pieces , and expand in the residual momentum @xmath178 now we need to find an action which has the proper quadratic piece to reproduce this two point function .",
    "we do this in two steps : first we notice that the numerator of the effective propagator is a projector onto the large components of the heavy quark spinor .",
    "so we should split up the heavy quark spinor into  large \" and  small \" components .",
    "then , to remove the heavy quark mass yet retain the field itself , we simply extract the mass dependence via a field redefinition @xcite , @xmath179 where @xmath180 here is where hqet differs from the usual effective theories where we remove entire fields from the action .",
    "the fields have _ labels _ @xmath89 . a field with a label @xmath89 ,",
    "destroys a particle whose four momentum is fixed to be within @xmath173 of @xmath181 .",
    "that is , the field itself only has fourier components less than @xmath173 .",
    "this is in accordance with our physical expectations .",
    "once we integrated out the hard modes , the only modes left have momenta of order @xmath173 whose effect is only to jiggle the heavy quark .",
    "so we write the momentum of the heavy quark as @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is called the  residual momentum \" and is of order @xmath173 .",
    "thus , derivatives acting on this rescaled field are of order @xmath173",
    ".    we may now substitute this parameterization of the full qcd field into the lagrangian to arrive at @xmath184 notice the sum over velocities .",
    "it is needed because we should allow for arbitrary four velocities of the heavy quark , and remember that once we fix a label the momentum is fixed up to some small an amount of @xmath185 .",
    "technically , this means that there is a super - selection rule , which is defined by the statement that states with four - velocities which differ by more than @xmath173 exist in different hilbert spaces .",
    "so to allow for differing velocities we have to  integrate in `` the different sectors .",
    "if we are only interested in processes with no weak decays this point becomes moot since we can go to a frame where the heavy quark is static .",
    "however , if we want to look at for instance a @xmath128 to @xmath186 transition then a large ' ' external \" momentum is injected which drastically changes the velocity of the heavy quark . in the effective theory",
    "this is described by the flavor changing current , whose labels reflect the connection between different hilbert spaces @xmath187 these type of label changing operators will play an important role in the next lecture .",
    "we performed a taylor expansion of our tree level propagator , should we expect this replacement to work even in loop diagrams ?",
    "the answer is of course , yes , and the reason is ( not to flog a dead horse ) that the part of the loop integral for which the taylor expansion is ill suited comes from uv physics , which is local and can always be absorbed into counter terms . technically , this can be see in a simple fashion .",
    "take any full theory integral , @xmath188 and write it as @xmath189 if @xmath188 is finite , then taylor expanding and integrating commute and there is no work to be done , the eft will reproduce the full theory to any desired order in the inverse mass . if the integral diverges ,",
    "then all we need to do is differentiate it enough times with respect to the external momentum to make it finite and then perform the taylor expansion .",
    "the value of the full integral will differ from the expanded integral by some polynomial in the external momentum , i.e. a counter - term . using this type of argument inductively an all orders proof has been provided both for four fermi theory @xcite and hqet @xcite .",
    "hqet is particularly simple because there is only one relevant ir region , @xmath190 .",
    "so we expect that taylor expanding around small loop momenta will correctly reproduce the ir physics .",
    "other theories may have more relevant ir momentum regions as will be discussed later on in these lectures .",
    "this line of reasoning can greatly simplify matching calculations .",
    "suppose we wish to match onto to hqet at one loop .",
    "the standard recipe is , take the full theory result , expanded in powers of @xmath191 , and subtract the value of the corresponding effective theory result .",
    "but there is actually a way to make life a lot less complicated by utilizing some of the magic of dimensional regularization and asymptotic expansions@xcite . instead of first calculating in the full theory and then expanding",
    ", one can taylor expand at the level of the integrand , assuming that the loop integrals are dominated by momenta much larger than the external momenta . by working in this way we will miss out on non - analytic pieces , but that s ok since we know that they cancel in the matching .",
    "how do we know that this method correctly reproduces the matching coefficient ?",
    "one way to think about it is in terms of the  method of regions\"@xcite .",
    "the idea is that in dimensional regularization the integral will receive contributions from momenta of order the heavy quark mass (  hard modes \" ) as well as momenta of order the residual momenta (  soft modes \" ) .",
    "this is true even for divergent integrals since the contribution from modes much larger than the quark mass lead to scaleless integrals which vanish .",
    "let us see how this works in a simple one loop example .",
    "consider the two point function integral @xmath192 @xmath183 is the residual momentum of order @xmath165 . to extract the hard contribution",
    "we assume @xmath193 is of order @xmath164 and taylor expand the integrand up to order @xmath194 @xmath195 whereas the soft part of the integral is found by assuming the loop momentum is order @xmath183 . keeping only the leading order piece in this region we find @xmath196 which is exactly the hqet contribution .",
    "so if we can show that the sum of these two contributions is equal to @xmath188 , then we ve shown that the hard piece is exactly what we would call the matching .",
    "the full integral can be performed using text - book methods @xmath197 where @xmath198 .",
    "the hard piece is given by @xmath199 the soft integral has denominators of differing dimensions , so it s helpful to use the identity @xmath200}{\\gamma[n]\\gamma[m]}\\int_0^\\infty d\\lambda \\frac{\\lambda^{m-1}}{(a+2 b \\lambda)^{n+m}}.\\ ] ] then following standard techniques we arrive at @xmath201 expanding the full theory result ( [ full ] ) and comparing it to the sum of ( [ soft ] ) and ( [ hard ] ) , we find agreement between the two .",
    "notice that both @xmath202 and @xmath203 have spurious divergences which cancel each other . for more complicated theories , such as @xmath204 , there are more regions to worry about , and one must be sure that they are all accounted for in order to correctly reproduce the full theory result .",
    "furthermore , one must be careful when matching at two loops using the above trick .",
    "doing so would necessitate keeping @xmath205 dependence in the effective theory action@xcite .",
    ".2 in * exercise 1.6 * in the last example i have expanded in @xmath205 before expanding in @xmath206 .",
    "show that the equality holds true even if you do nt expand in @xmath205 by calculating the full result exactly and then expanding in @xmath194 .",
    ".2 in    the method of  asymptotic expansions \" has been proven to work to all orders for both the large momentum and large mass limits for euclidean momenta . however , there are no known counter - examples to two loops in minkowski space .",
    "suppose we chose to match exactly at zero external momentum .",
    "we are free to do this if we are not interested in corrections which are sub - leading @xmath16 .",
    "it is often the case that at this point the integrals in the effective theory will be scaleless and thus vanish ( this is true in hqet as well as nrqcd ) .",
    "however , this does not mean that we can conclude that the effective theory operator under consideration has no anomalous dimension . to calculate the running in the effective theory we need to account for the fact that the scaleless integral @xmath207 is giving zero because of a cancellation @xmath208 given any logarithmically divergent scaleless integral we can always perform this split algebraically @xmath209 however , if and only if , we know that the full theory has no ir poles , can we correctly conclude that the anomalous dimension in the effective theory vanishes when we have scaleless integrals .",
    "when the full theory has no ir poles , the effective theory has no ir poles and since in the effective theory ( for scaleless integrals ) there is also a one to one correspondence of uv and ir poles we may conclude that the effective theory has no uv poles .",
    "this is an important point : we ca nt ignore dimensionless integrals in dimensional regularization in the effective theory unless we are sure that we have correctly accounted for all of the ir poles in the full theory .      in most effective field theories",
    "the power counting is as simple as keeping track of powers of the mass .",
    "however , this will no longer be true in more complicated efts .",
    "power counting is trivial in hqet , but i want to go through it pedantically , since such an analysis will bear fruit later . once we ve removed the heavy quark mass ,",
    "there is only one relevant scale , @xmath173 .",
    "all of the fields have support only over regions of order @xmath210 so we should expect that dimensional analysis will yield the correct power counting .",
    "let s see if this is true .",
    "the leading order action , @xmath211 should scale as @xmath212 .",
    "each field scales as @xmath213 while the derivative scales as @xmath173 .",
    "finally , since the fields only have support over region of size @xmath173 , @xmath214 , the leading order action does indeed scale properly .",
    "in general , there may be more than one scale involved and the scaling of the fields is instead fixed according to the leading order action .",
    "all other operators in the action should scale as positive powers of @xmath173 , since if there were operators with negative powers , power counting will be jeopardized .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to finish our inclusive b decay calculation .",
    "we started with a theory with three scales , @xmath94 , @xmath136 and @xmath173 .",
    "we eliminated @xmath94 , ran down to @xmath136 and are now have the power , via @xmath215 , to remove @xmath136 .",
    "removing this scale is crucial , even if we are not interested in the enhanced symmetry . to see this",
    ", we have to figure out how to evaluate the time ordered product ( [ ope ] ) .",
    "i will only sketch this final part of the calculation since it s is explained in details in @xcite .",
    "the main point is that the non - local operator product can be simplified using an operator product expansion ( ope ) much as in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite ( though the use of the ope in the present context is not rigorously justified as it is in dis ) .",
    "the top can be expanded into a set of local operators , schematically @xmath216 where @xmath193 here is the large scale in the process ( for us @xmath217 ) .",
    "the utility of the expansion is predicated on our ability to truncate it . as long as",
    "when we take the matrix elements of the @xmath218 , we do nt introduce a scale of order @xmath193 upstairs , we can safely ignore terms of higher order in @xmath219 .",
    "now we can see that in the case of @xmath127 decays we will run into exactly this problem since we will be taking matrix elements between @xmath127 states . so that while each term in the expansion may be down by powers of @xmath193 , i.e. @xmath136 , taking the matrix element will generate expectation values which scale with positive powers of @xmath136 .",
    "the solution to this problem is simply to go to the effective theory , where the scale @xmath136 is gone and all matrix elements scale only as @xmath173 . how the ope is performed in hqet is discussed in @xcite .",
    "i want to emphasize the fact that using a mass independent prescription is crucial for this , as well as most other , eft calculations .",
    "in fact , eft and mass independent prescriptions go usually go hand in hand ( lattice effective theories are exceptions to this rule ) . to see the need for this marriage ,",
    "suppose we re trying to calculate the running of a gauge coupling .",
    "our prescription can not affect any physical prediction , but a poor choice of prescription can lead to an ill behaved perturbative series .",
    "let s compare and contrast the contributions of a massive fermion to the qed vacuum polarization in the @xmath48 and momentum subtraction @xmath220 schemes . @xmath221,\\ ] ] @xmath222,\\ ] ] where @xmath223 is the scale at which we have chosen to define the coupling , so that in the @xmath224 scheme @xmath225 .",
    "for @xmath226 we may choose @xmath227 and neither scheme will produce large logs .",
    "the problem arises when we have two fermions with very disparate masses . indeed",
    ", suppose that in addition to the fermion of mass @xmath228 , we also a massless charged fermion in the theory .",
    "then we can see that in the @xmath48 scheme , there is no choice of @xmath51 for which there are no large logs . on the other hand in the @xmath220 scheme we can choose @xmath229 and",
    "no large logs will remain .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the @xmath224 scheme is a  decoupling scheme \" while @xmath48 is not .",
    "that is , in the @xmath48 massive particles do not decouple in the low energy limit .",
    "that is exactly why we should work in an eft , where we remove the heavy particles by hand .",
    "this is the small price we have to pay in order the easily sum the logs .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath224 scheme we will need to calculate @xmath230 , given its value at some other momenta at which it was measured @xmath231 , and solving the rg equations in this scheme is more difficult .",
    "i should also say that even if you work in a mass independent scheme you do nt _ have to _ use an eft , it s just that without eft calculations become more cumbersome since the low energy observables will receive contributions from all the heavy fields which re - introduce large logs .",
    "but in the end if you are careful you should always get the same result . using an eft",
    "will just make your life _ a lot _ easier .",
    "when working in an effective theory , or any theory for that matter , it is easy to get confused if one does not work with physical quantities .",
    "coupling are in general scheme dependent and have no physical meaning , thus it is always best to have in mind some measurable observable when doing a calculation .",
    "often in these lectures instead of talking about measuring a coupling , i will instead talk about measuring the force between static sources .",
    "in this way we can be assured that our result is in no way ambiguous .",
    "this force or potential is intimately related to what we normally call the coupling , but is a measurable quantity and thus scheme independent .",
    "we begin by showing that the static potential can be extracted by calculating the expectation value @xmath232=\\langle 0 \\mid t(e^{-i e \\int d^4x e j^\\mu(x ) a_\\mu(x)}\\mid 0 \\rangle\\ ] ] for a stationary charge distribution which turns off adiabatically at @xmath233 . then using standard arguments ( see @xcite ) @xmath234\\propto e^{i e(j ) t},\\ ] ] where @xmath235 is the vacuum energy in the presence of the source @xmath236 .",

    "i.e. no matter , things simplify tremendously since the action is quadratic in the gauge field , and hence the functional integral can be done exactly , resulting in @xmath240 \\propto e^{-\\frac{ie^2}{2 } \\int d^4x d^4y j^\\mu(x ) \\delta_{\\mu \\nu}(x , y ) j^\\nu(y)}\\ ] ] where @xmath241 is the photon propagator",
    ". we will be interested in the energy of two static sources , of opposite charge , separated by a spatial distance @xmath242 .",
    "so that @xmath243 then it is straightforward to show that @xmath244 diagrammatically , one can arrive at result by using wicks theorem on ( [ z ] ) . at leading order in the coupling",
    "there is one diagram corresponding to one photon exchange , resulting in the integral @xmath245 at next order there are two wick contractions , but these sum to give the square of @xmath246 with a combinatoric factor of @xmath247 .",
    "one can then see that subsequent wick contractions will just fill out the power series expansion of the exponential@xcite .",
    "now when we include matter , the only new diagrams which arise correspond to corrections to the photon propagator .",
    "thus all the logarithmic corrections to coulomb s law will arise from loops in the photonic two point function . resumming the vacuum polarization graphs results in the corrected form of the potential @xmath248 where @xmath249    when we go to qcd , things get slightly more complicated but",
    ", at least up to two loops , the same reasoning goes through @xcite .",
    "the potential is given by the logarithmically corrected coulomb potential with the appropriate beta function .",
    "however , at three loops one encounters an infra - red divergence@xcite arising from the fact that there can be intermediate color octet states that live for long times .",
    "these colored states can interact with long wavelength gluons since they have non - vanishing dipole moments .",
    "however , this should not bother us .",
    "the vacuum matrix element contains long distance physics , and thus it need not be infra - red finite in perturbation theory .",
    "in the previous lecture we displayed the utility of encapsulating the uv physics in an effective field theory . in our toy model we completely removed a heavy field , while in hqet we kept the field but removed the mass . in both of these cases",
    "the non - analytic momentum dependence came from rather simple kinematic configurations . in the toy model",
    "all the cuts were generated from intermediate light particles going on shell . in hqet",
    "the cuts come from either gluons or heavy quark lines going on shell with @xmath250 .",
    "but there are certain kinematic situations where the momenta configurations which determine the cuts of a greens function can be more complicated . consider for instance a non - relativistic bound state such as hydrogen or quarkonia.this hierarchy most probably does not hold for the case of the @xmath251 and may not for the @xmath252 either",
    ". attempts at alternate power countings which arise when this criteria are not met can be found in @xcite . ] . in this case",
    "the on - shell external lines in our greens functions will obey a non - relativistic dispersion relation , leading to the propagator @xmath253 and the cuts will come from a momenta region where @xmath254 .",
    "notice that , as opposed to the case of our toy model and hqet where there was only one relevant low energy scale , @xmath9 and @xmath173 , respectively , a non - relativistic theory contains two scales namely @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "that is , the typical size of the bound state is the bohr radius @xmath257 and the typical time scale is the rydberg @xmath258 .",
    "the existence of these two scales complicates matters . as in our previous cases",
    "we d like to eliminate all the large scales from the theory , leaving a nice simple theory with only one low energy scale .",
    "unfortunately , as we shall see this is not possible due to the fact that the two scales @xmath259 and @xmath260 are correlated , and must exist simultaneously .",
    "suppose we try to treat the scale @xmath259 in the same way that we treated the mass in hqet , i.e. by rescaling the quark fields .",
    "this would indeed remove it from the theory , and all derivatives would scale homogeneously as @xmath260 . however , since spatial fluctuations on the scale @xmath259 are crucial to the dynamics of the bound state , we know that this ca nt be the end of the story as far as this scale is concerned . in fact , as we shall see , the coulomb potential is built from the exchange of gluons with three momentum of order @xmath259 .",
    "so if we eliminate the modes with momenta of order @xmath259 by re - phasing the field we had better figure out how to put ( integrate ) them back in . at first",
    ", this seems like a silly thing to do , but we will see that this formal manipulation will simplify the construction of the effective theory since all spatial derivatives will scale homogeneously .",
    "if we did not do this re - phasing we would not have manifest power counting , as we shall see .",
    "but we are jumping the gun a little .",
    "let us treat one scale at a time from top down .",
    "we begin by first eliminating the mass from theory as we did in hqet by a simple rescaling of the field @xmath261 where @xmath262 are the large and small two spinors of the full dirac quark spinor , respectively .",
    "as opposed to hqet , there is now a preferred frame , namely the center of mass frame .",
    "so we will assume that we are working in this frame from now on .",
    "thus when we rescale the field we wo nt sum over all four velocities , as we did in hqet . also i wo nt bother labelling the fields by their four velocity , as there is only one relevant label velocity @xmath171 . if we wanted to allow for weak decays we would have to include a sum over four - momenta labels as we did in hqet .",
    "now we can separate the next largest scale , @xmath259 , from the other scales in the theory by writing @xmath263 where the label on the field fixes the three momentum to be order @xmath264 .",
    "spatial derivatives acting on @xmath265 are of order the residual three momenta @xmath260 .",
    "this way of splitting up momenta into a large label piece and a residual momentum is depicted in figure ( [ boxes ] ) .    the free piece of the action",
    "can then be read off by substituting the expansions ( [ exp ] ) and ( [ fieldexp ] ) into the full qcd action , solving for the small component @xmath266 in terms of the large component @xmath267 , and keeping only the leading order terms in an expansion in the small parameter @xmath89 , @xmath268 notice that we have dropped all spatial derivative terms , such as @xmath269 , as they are higher order in @xmath89 .",
    "remember that the @xmath270 which appears in the action is a c number and not an operator .",
    "@xmath271 is the _",
    "large _ component of the anti - quark field , which arises when we re - phase with the opposite sign in ( 60 ) , and its action on the fock space is to destroy an anti - quark",
    ".      the interactions can be fixed by a matching calculations , though some interactions are more simply read off by gauge invariance , as we shall see .",
    "let s start by considering the t - channel exchange of a gluon between a quark and anti - quark in the full theory as shown in figure ( [ coulfig ] ) .",
    "since the initial and final state quarks are on shell , the gluon momentum must scale as @xmath272 .",
    "we split the external three momenta into a piece of order @xmath259 , corresponding to the label of the field , and a residual momenta @xmath183 , which if of order @xmath260 .",
    "we then expand the full theory result in @xmath89 and write the full theory spinors in terms of the two spinors ( [ 2spins ] ) .",
    "the leading order piece generates the operator @xmath273 this operator is nothing but the coulomb potential .",
    "it is called a  potential \" because the interaction is non - local in space but instantaneous in time .",
    "notice that @xmath274 includes a sum over all possible labels .",
    "this is in stark contrast to hqet where an external current is needed to change labels . here in nrqcd",
    ", there are terms in the action which themselves change labels .",
    "what we have done seems a little perverse at first .",
    "we have integrated out modes ( via a field rescaling ) only to integrate them back in by summing over labels .",
    "however , we will see that there is a method to the madness .",
    "now let us power count to see if the operator ( [ coulomb ] ) we matched onto should appear in the leading order lagrangian .",
    "to do so we first need to determine how the fields scale .",
    "the easiest way to do this is to use the fact that the kinetic piece should be order one in our power counting .",
    "so , following the line of reasoning developed in section [ hqetpc ] , we first power count the measure in the action .",
    "the quark field has support over @xmath275 in the time direction . ] and order @xmath276 in the spatial directions so we conclude that @xmath277 and @xmath278 . in this way",
    "the kinetic piece ( [ lonrqcd ] ) scales as @xmath279 .",
    "now let us consider the operator ( [ coulomb ] ) .",
    "the measure again scales the same way as in the kinetic piece since the operator contains only heavy quarks , so that @xmath280 thus @xmath281 certainly should be treated as a leading order piece in the lagrangian .",
    "indeed , the fact that it actually is enhanced relative to kinetic piece is worrisome as it could lead us to the conclusion that there is no sensible @xmath282 limit , which is the limit in which the leading order action is exact .",
    "we will come back to this issue later .",
    "for now we will conclude that the coulomb potential will have to be treated non - perturbatively in our theory .",
    "the operator can be interpreted in terms of the exchange of a non - propagating coulomb gluon .",
    "if we wish we can re - write this operator in terms of an auxiliary field ( i.e. a field without a kinetic term)@xcite @xmath283 writing things in this way will make our relevant degrees of freedom more explicit when we discuss nrqcd in terms of the method of regions as discussed in ( [ regions ] ) .",
    "but this is just a formal manipulation . in general , `` off shell ''",
    "modes will not appear in the lagrangian .",
    "what interactions are there in the one quark sector ?",
    "we should allow for all interactions which leave the fields on - shell to within order @xmath260 , which is the scale of their residual momentum , as these modes will certainly generate non - analyticity in our amplitudes .",
    "one obvious interaction we can have is of the usual form @xmath284 , if @xmath285 is a gluon which carries momentum scaling as @xmath286 .",
    "in fact , gauge invariance seems to lead us to this type of interaction , since we would expect that the @xmath287 in ( [ lonrqcd ] ) should be elevated to a covariant derivative .",
    "let s see if this new interaction does indeed to correspond to @xmath286 gluons .",
    "the self energy diagram in figure ( [ senrqcd ] ) is given by @xmath288 now we will show that the gluon running through the loop does have momentum which scales as @xmath286 .",
    "the important point to note here is that the fermion propagator does not carry any of the three momentum of the gluon .",
    "the @xmath289 piece is just the label of the external line .",
    "this is an implementation of a dipole expansion @xcite @xmath290 .2 in * exercise 2.1 * working with a coordinate space dipole expanded lagrangian reproduce equation ( [ nrqcdse ] ) for the self - energy .",
    ".2 in it is interesting that the act of separating the scales via the re - labelling technique has automatically generated a dipole expansion .",
    "this demonstrates a persistent fact in effective field theories . if you have properly separated the scales , then each diagram in the effective theory should scale homogeneously in the expansion parameter . in order for this to be true",
    "any given integral should be dominated by just one region of momenta .",
    "let us see how this happens in our self - energy diagram .",
    "doing the integral by contours we see that the @xmath291 , there are no other relevant regions .",
    "note that if we had not dipole expanded then the integral would have received a contribution where @xmath292 was of order @xmath228 , and the integral would not scale homogeneously in @xmath89 .",
    "this would spoil the power counting in the theory @xcite .",
    "gluons which have momenta of order @xmath286 are called `` ultra - soft ( us ) '' , and are on shell - modes which have the usual @xmath293 kinetic term in the lagrangian .",
    "these modes are sometimes also referred to as `` radiation '' or``dynamical '' gluons which can be thought of as contributing to higher fock states in the onia .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath294 us mode can be eliminated from the leading order action by redefining the quark field in the following fashion @xmath295 where p stands for path ordering and @xmath296 is the time like unit vector @xmath171 .",
    "the @xmath294 us gluons will then reappear in the action at higher order in @xmath89 .",
    "thus without doing any calculations we can conclude that the interactions due to @xmath294 us modes must vanish at leading order .",
    "there are additional us spatially polarized gluons ( @xmath297 ) which play an important role at sub - leading order in @xmath89 .",
    "we can determine the coupling of these gluons in a very simple way using what is known as _",
    "reparameterization invariance_@xcite ( rpi ) .",
    "the idea behind rpi is quite simple , yet its ramifications are powerful .",
    "the point is that when we pulled out the three momenta from the heavy quark field , there was an ambiguity .",
    "we could just as easily rescaled by @xmath298 where @xmath183 is order @xmath260 .",
    "thus our action should be independent under small shifts in the label .",
    "this just means that every time we see a @xmath299 it should be accompanied by a @xmath300 .",
    "then by gauge invariance we know that we should make the replacement @xmath301 everywhere we see @xmath299 .",
    "notice that this form has to hold to all order in perturbation theory .",
    "this is quite a useful piece of information , as it tells us that many operators in our action will have vanishing anomalous dimension .",
    "the net effect of this substitution is the generation of subleading terms in the dipole expansion ( [ dipole ] ) .",
    "for instance , the kinetic term @xmath302 will generate the subleading dipole interaction @xmath303 .",
    "note that @xmath304 , scales as @xmath305 , since when the derivative acts on the heavy quark field it brings down a factor of the _ residual momentum _ which is of order @xmath305 , and , as you can prove for yourself , the ultra - soft gluon field scales as @xmath305 as well .",
    "so now we have shown that there are two types of gluonic modes which contribute to the non - analytic behavior of the low energy theory : potential gluons ( which are not dynamical ) , whose momenta scale as @xmath272 , and `` ultra - soft '' ( us ) gluons whose momenta scale as ( @xmath306 . but",
    "this can not be the end of the story .",
    "in particular , we know that the coulomb potential should run even once we are below the scale @xmath228 , due to the non - abelian nature of the theory . we might expect that a diagram such as ( [ coulse ] ) could account for the running of the coupling / potential .",
    "however , this diagram does not exist in the effective theory , since the coulomb gluon is not a propagating degree of freedom ( it is simple to show that this diagram vanishes ) .",
    "the coulomb gluon sometimes called an  off - shell \" mode because it can never satisfy the gluon dispersion relation @xmath307 , and thus never appears as an external state . to generate a running coulomb potential we must include a new set of propagating degrees of freedom@xcite , namely ,",
    " soft gluons \" , whose momenta scale as @xmath308 .",
    "how could such degrees of freedom interact with the heavy quarks ?",
    "we notice that because their energy scales as @xmath259 , any such interaction would throw the heavy quark off - shell by an amount of order @xmath259 .",
    "so we know that we need at least two interactions .",
    "the simplest such interactions are shown in figure ( @xmath309 ) .    now",
    "since these modes have a `` large '' component , in both their energy _ and _ momentum , we need to rescale the field so that all derivatives acting on the field scale as the lowest scale in the theory , @xmath260 .",
    "so as in the case of the heavy quark field we write @xmath310 notice the field is now labelled by a four momentum .",
    "now we match the compton graphs in figure ( [ compton ] ) onto the effective theory .",
    "to do so we split the external momenta of the gluon fields into a label piece and a small residual momentum @xmath311 and expand the diagram in powers of @xmath89 . keeping only the leading order result",
    "we find @xmath312 \\psi_{\\bf \\vec{p } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { g^{\\nu 0 } \\left(q^\\prime - p+p^\\prime\\right)^\\mu - g^{\\mu 0 }    \\left(q - p+p^\\prime\\right)^\\nu + g^{\\mu\\nu } \\left(q - q^\\prime \\right )    \\over \\left ( { \\bf\\vec{p}}^\\prime-{\\bf \\vec{p } } \\right)^2 } \\psi_{\\bf{\\vec{p}^\\prime } } ^\\dagger \\left[a^\\nu_{q^\\prime},a^\\mu_q \\right ] \\psi_{\\bf \\vec{p } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad + \\frac{-q_0}{(\\bf{\\vec{p}^\\prime-\\vec{p}})^2 } \\psi^\\dagger_{\\bf \\vec{p } } [ \\bar{c}_q^\\prime , c_q]\\psi_{\\bf \\vec{p}}\\biggr\\ } + \\psi \\leftrightarrow \\chi,\\ t \\leftrightarrow \\bar t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where i have also included the contribution from the ghosts @xmath313 , which are not shown in the figure .",
    "as we will see , this interaction will be responsible for the running of the coulomb potential .",
    "note that it vanishes for the abelian case , which is consistent with the fact that there is no change in the force law below the scale of the electron mass in qed .",
    "this cancellation would not arise if we did not drop the @xmath314 in the denominator .",
    "keeping the @xmath314 would mean including a contribution where the gluons are potential and not soft . to see this",
    "write the intermediate fermion propagator as @xmath315 the delta function forces the gluon to have vanishing energy , i.e. it becomes a potential gluon @xcite . in the effective theory",
    "this potential contribution is accounted for by operators which describe the scattering of soft modes off of a four fermion potential ( see @xcite for details ) .    furthermore , to include the effects of the `` massless '' quarks we will need to include a soft fermion field for each such flavor .",
    "so now we have two propagating gluonic degrees of freedom , the soft @xmath308 and ultra - soft ( us ) @xmath286 .",
    "the kinetic terms for these fields are @xmath316 here the fields strengths are composed of purely us gluons @xmath317 $ ] . while the second term in ( [ gaugekinetic ] ) generates the propagator for the soft gluons .",
    "we may treat the us field as a background gauge field .",
    "given the relative time scales of these two modes , the us modes are frozen , as far as the soft gluons are concerned thus in a background field formalism ( see @xcite for a review ) , we may gauge fix the us fields and the soft fields independently . the us gauge invariance is manifest while the soft gauge invariance is only seen when combined with re - parameterization invariance .",
    "note that there will also be soft ( labelled ) ghost fields as well .",
    "the full soft lagrangian , including ghosts , can be found in @xcite .    we are now prepared to see if the soft interaction lagrangian is leading order in @xmath89 .",
    "each soft gluon field scales as @xmath89 , as can be read off from ( [ gaugekinetic ] ) , while each fermion field gives a factor of @xmath318 . how does the measure scale ?",
    "the fermion has ( temporal , spatial ) support on the scale @xmath319 , whereas the gauge field has support only on scales of order @xmath276 .",
    "thus , the measure scales as @xmath320 , since outside this volume the integrand vanishes as depicted in ( [ overlap ] ) .",
    "thus the soft interaction lagrangian @xmath321 scales as @xmath279 and is indeed leading order .",
    "however , since this interaction is also order @xmath161 we need not treat it non - perturbatively .",
    "now let us take stock in what we have built .",
    "so far we have a leading order action which contains the kinetic pieces for the fermions and gluons ( [ lonrqcd ] ) and ( [ gaugekinetic ] ) , as well as two leading order interactions ( [ coulomb ] ) and ( [ softint ] ) .",
    "if we want to match beyond leading order in @xmath322 , we need to know how to calculate using our effective theory .",
    "calculating loop graphs seems rather complicated given that we will have loops with sums over labels .",
    "however , it will turn out in the end to be quite simple .",
    "as a first example suppose we re interested in a loop consisting of two insertions of @xmath274 , as shown in figure ( [ onelopcoul ] ) .",
    "[ onelopcoul ]    the external fermions have energy @xmath323 and momenta @xmath324 . in the effective theory ,",
    "the external fermions have soft momentum ( labels ) @xmath325 , and the ultra - soft momentum @xmath326 .",
    "the intermediate fermions in the effective theory have soft momentum @xmath327 , and ultra - soft momentum @xmath328 .",
    "the graph in the effective theory is proportional to the integral @xmath329 there is an integral over the ultra - soft energy @xmath330 , the ultra - soft momentum @xmath331 , and a sum over the soft momentum @xmath332 .",
    "summing over @xmath333 and integrating over @xmath334 is equivalent to integrating over the entire momentum space .",
    "thus one can replace eq .",
    "( [ nrqed:5 ] ) by @xmath335 where @xmath336 soft loops are treated in a similar fashion .",
    "consider the diagram with the insertion of two soft interactions as shown in figure ( [ softex ] ) .",

    "the sum on @xmath193 is over a four - vector . as in the case of the potential loops",
    ", we make the replacement @xmath338 where the replacement must be done for all four components of @xmath193 , since soft gluons carry a four - vector label @xmath193 .",
    "there is a much simpler way to arrive at the effective theory integrand .",
    "just take the full theory graphs , assume the proper scaling for the gluon loop momentum , i.e. soft , potential or us , and just keep the leading order term in each propagator .",
    "let us now consider to matching at higher orders in @xmath89 , but still at tree level .",
    "we can guess the first correction to the kinetic energy from the dispersion relation @xmath339 formally this piece can be derived simply by keeping the sub - leading terms in the expansion of the qcd action in terms of the non - relativistic fields ( [ fieldexp ] ) .",
    "the more relevant correction comes from higher order terms in the multipole expansion , @xmath340 the ultra - soft gluon field inside @xmath341 scales as @xmath305 , as does the derivative since it brings down a factor of the residual momentum of the heavy quark .",

    "but before we plunge into a calculation we must address an intricacy of nrqcd which i touched upon previously .",
    "in particular , we noticed that the coulomb potential scales as @xmath276 . on the face of it , this presents a serious problem to the theory for the following reason .",
    "suppose we wish to calculate the matrix element of some operator in the effective theory , @xmath355 .",
    "at order in @xmath356 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath357 where @xmath358 are terms in the sub - leading hamiltonian such that their net order in @xmath89 is @xmath356 .",
    "given that the contribution from the coulomb potential is of order @xmath276 and must be treated non - perturbatively , it appears that the time ordered product will not have a definite scaling in @xmath89 .",

    "however , when we match , we must account for the fact that the coulomb potential can enhance a sub - leading operator , at the cost of a power of @xmath161 .",
    "for instance , if we want to match at order @xmath361 , then we have to include contributions of the form @xmath362 where @xmath363 is an order @xmath364 piece of the lagrangian .    as a practical example",

    "notice that at one loop the current has no anomalous dimension .",
    "we can conclude this from the fact that all of the ir poles in the full theory cancelled ( see section 1.8.2 ) in general we would not expect this since in the effective theory the current does not generate a symmetry .",
    "in fact we will see that at two loops we will generate an anomalous dimension .    at two loops",
    "one must account for the possible coulomb enhancement discussed previously in this section .",
    "so if we concerned with contributions of order @xmath371 , we must include all possible operator insertion such that the net power is @xmath279 .",

    "we must include one insertion of this potential in addition to insertions of the order @xmath89 potentials already discussed in the previous section .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in ( [ twolooprun ] ) .",
    "in addition there are corrections which contain coulomb singularities @xmath276 , i.e. those contributions whose net scaling has inverse powers of @xmath89 .",
    "however , these wo nt contribute to the matching since they will cancel in the full and effective theory .",
    "the purpose of this example was just to illustrate that when you match you must remember that sub - leading operators can be enhanced due to the @xmath276 nature of the coulomb potential . to my knowledge , as of the time of this writing , this subtlety is unique to nrqcd .",
    "it is interesting to note that had we done the two loop calculation using hqet propagators we would get a vanishing anomalous dimension .",
    "this is most easily seen in @xmath375 gauge .",
    ".3 in * exercise 2.4 : * prove that in the @xmath376 scheme the anomalous dimensions of the production current is gauge invariant . to prove this write down two equations for the current .",
    "one imposing its independence from @xmath51 and the other its independence of the gauge fixing parameter @xmath322 .",
    "then commute the two equations to derive a set of relations which allows you to complete the proof . if you get stuck consult the original reference @xcite .",
    ".3 in    the reason hqet gets it wrong lies in the theory s inability to properly describe fermion - fermion propagation .",
    "what happens is that hqet misses out on the coulomb singularity .",
    "this fact emphasizes an important point about nrqcd .",
    "you ca nt treat the scales @xmath259 and @xmath260 independently .",
    "usually we would argue that between the scales @xmath228 and @xmath259 , @xmath260 should be treatable as a perturbation , much as we would treat a light quark mass when working at a scale @xmath377 .",
    "but the fact that we need to keep the kinetic piece of the action at leading order is telling us that both @xmath259 and @xmath260 must exist simultaneously in the theory . after a brief diversion",
    "we will see the consequences of this correlation of scales .",
    "you have probably noticed that i have been careful not to specify the scale at which to evaluate the running couplings @xmath378 .",
    "such a specification implies we have control of the logarithmic corrections , which i will only now discuss .",
    "as shown in the previous lecture the recipe for summing large logs is typically straightforward .",
    "suppose we have a theory with two  large \" ( relative to the scale at which experiments are to be performed @xmath323 ) scales @xmath379 . in a general diagram",

    "we will call this procedure `` two stage running '' . in the case of nrqcd , where we have two large scales @xmath228 and @xmath259 and a low energy scale of @xmath260",
    ", we will get logs of the form @xmath385 and @xmath386 .",
    "so we might be tempted to follow the standard machinery and turn the crank .",
    "match at @xmath228 , run to @xmath259 integrated modes of momenta @xmath259 and then run down to the scale @xmath260 . however , nrqcd is a lot more interesting than that .",
    "the basic point is that the two scales @xmath259 and @xmath260 are correlated .",
    "they should nt be treated independently , since they coexist in the fermionic propagator .",
    "if we were to follow the two stage running in nrqcd , we would first match at @xmath228 onto an hqet like theory by rescaling the fields only by their masses . in this case",
    "we should allow for quark virtualities @xmath387 and one might wish to treat @xmath388 as a perturbation leaving the hqet form of the propagators . but as we discussed above , we know that this will give the wrong anomalous dimension for the current @xcite . instead , in nrqcd what we must do is match directly , at the scale @xmath228 , onto the theory in which @xmath389 .",
    "so we can see immediately that the two stage running will not be appropriate .",
    "instead we do what is known as `` one stage running '' .",
    "given that we have to match directly onto a theory in which two scales exist simultaneously , how can we sum the large logs ?",
    "in general , potential and soft loops will generate @xmath390 , while us loops will introduce logs of the form @xmath391 .",

    "then in one - stage running , integrating the anomalous dimensions will give @xmath413 whereas two - stage running yields @xmath414 and we see that the cross terms differ by a factor of two .",
    "let us now return to the question of the running of the coulomb potential .",
    "this running is particularly simple because the renormalization only involves soft loops .",
    "the matching coefficient is simply @xmath415 , and the running is generated by figure ( 15 ) , with each vertex giving a factor of @xmath416 @xmath417 there are also corrections stemming from us temporal gluon loops , but these vanish for reasons which were previously discussed .",

    "the large logs can be avoided by choosing @xmath424 in the potential .",
    "this agrees with our intuitive picture of the force law ( wilson loop ) getting quantum corrections due to the running of the coupling .",

    "i would now like to utilize this formalism in a simple setting , namely , the lamb shift in qed .",
    "this is a beautiful example because , not only does the formalism simplify the calculation , but it also provides one with immediate information about sub - leading orders , as we shall see .",

    "matching at @xmath399 we find @xmath453    in addition , at this order , we should include corrections from the operator @xmath339 thus the mass splitting is given by @xmath454 calculating these matrix elements is nothing more than solving the coulomb problem to first order in perturbation theory , which we can solve quantum mechanically@xcite .",
    "that is why it is simple to see that @xmath452 does not contribute to the energy shift in the @xmath239 wave since its wave function vanishes at the origin .",

    "the solution to the rg equation is trivial @xmath462 we thus see that the series does indeed terminate .",
    "qed has a hard time generating logs because the coupling freezes below the scale @xmath461 . at leading order",

    "the reason the series terminates , is due the fact that the coupling in qed does not run below the scale of the electron mass . in qcd",
    "the series is not so simple .      before closing out this lecture",
    "i would like to emphasize an important point about the states in any effective theory .",
    "if we wish to keep our ducks in a row we should be sure to treat the states of the effective theory as eigenstates of the _ lowest _ order piece of the action .",
    "power corrections to the states come from taking time ordered products in the low energy matrix elements .",
    "this is exactly what we do in quantum mechanics .",
    "we perturb around the lowest order wave functions . in this way",
    "we can keep track of various power law corrections .",
    "it is a simple exercise to see exactly how this works generically .",
    "suppose we are considering a correction to the expectation value for some transition operator @xmath469 where @xmath470 are eigenstates of @xmath471 .",
    "the two time orderings correspond to corrections to @xmath472 and @xmath473 .",
    "let s consider the contribution from @xmath474 . using the representation of the theta function @xmath475 and inserting a complete set of states yields @xmath476 then recalling from basic time independent perturbation theory that the first correction ( @xmath477 ) to the zeroth order eigenstate ( @xmath478 ) of the full hamiltonian @xmath479 is given by @xmath480 we explicitly see that the time ordered product accounts for corrections to the wave function .",
    "let me emphasize that there is nothing wrong with treating the physical states as eigenstates of the exact hamiltonian .",
    "this is often done in the literature .",
    "one often reads about  higher fock states \" of a bound state .",
    "for instance in the case of nrqcd one often hears the term  dynamical gluons \" as being part of a higher fock state of the onium .",
    "again , there is nothing wrong with this , it just goes against the spirit of effective field theory as espoused in these lectures .",
    "but there are advantages to treating the states as lowest order eigenstates .",
    "for instance , in the case of hqet the leading power corrections to the meson masses coming from the operators @xmath481 are cleanly separated from higher order power corrections .",
    "this would not be true if we took the meson to be an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian since the expectation values of @xmath482 and @xmath483 would contain contributions of order @xmath484 .",
    "of course this would only be an issue if we were interested in @xmath485 corrections .",
    "in this second lecture i have introduced some new concepts into the game . in particular , the idea that one can integrate out massless particles by breaking up the field into various components . in the case of nrqcd",
    "we split up the gluon field into four types of modes : hard @xmath486 , though i did nt use this term previously .",
    "these are just the gluons which we integrate out when we match at the scale @xmath228 .",
    "potential @xmath272 , soft @xmath308 and ultra - soft @xmath286 .",
    "these last 3 modes are believed to be sufficient to correctly reproduce all the non - analytic structure of non - relativistic greens function .",
    "to date this has only been proven up to two loops .",
    "once we determined the modes , we fixed their couplings by matching , although gauge invariance and rpi fix many such couplings without doing any work .",
    "the way we arrived at the proper mode decomposition was far from systematic .",
    "indeed , finding the proper modes is more of an art form at this point .",
    "the potential and us modes fell out directly from matching , while we deduced the need for the soft modes from physical argument .",
    "of course had we carried out the matching in the two quark sector we would have immediately seen the need for a soft mode .",
    "in particular , if you calculate the full qcd box diagram you will see that just including the potential and the us modes is not sufficient to reproduce the full result @xcite .",
    "there is no general rule for determining what modes are necessary .",
    "however , there are some guiding principles .",
    "first we must determine the scales involved in the external states of the theory .",
    "in the case of nrqcd , those would be @xmath259 and @xmath260 . then there are some obvious modes that one can pick out that are necessary .",
    "those are modes which leave the external lines on shell .",
    "so for a fermion with momentum @xmath487 we know that us and potential gluons should contribute to the non - analytic behavior of the greens functions .",
    "after that , finding more modes starts to get harder and you have to do some matching calculations to be sure . but its pretty clear that the other modes should also be formed from these scales .",
    "so the soft @xmath308 modes are an obvious choice . since these modes throw quarks off - shell , its clear that you will need more than one interaction vertex to generate an operator in the effective theory .",
    "then what about @xmath487 modes ?",
    "physically , these modes would mediate interactions which are non - local in time but local in space , which is clearly unphysical , and in fact a simple calculation shows that such modes ca nt contribute .",
    "what about modes with higher powers of @xmath89 such as @xmath488 ?",
    "it is simple to see that these modes would give zero since this scale can be dropped in all propagator , and so loop integrals would be independent of the loop variable itself .",
    "the interested reader should study scet@xcite where similar mode deconstructions are performed .",
    "i would now like to discuss the application of effective field theories to the speculative topic of extra dimensions .",
    "the basic idea of using extra dimensions to unify forces goes back to the early part of the twentieth century with the work of kaluza and klein .",
    "but while extra dimensions have always played a role in string theory , from a phenomenological stand point the topic was dormant until a few years back .",
    "the reason for this dormancy was that the size of the extra dimensions was always assumed to be of order the planck scale , and therefore , the measurable effects of the extra dimensions are so suppressed that they are irrelevant for all intents and purposes .",
    "however , with the advent of d - brane ideas , it was realized that the extra dimensions can be of arbitrarily large size ( up to the experimental limits for gravity at short distances@xcite ) since string theory provides a mechanism for field localization .",
    "that is , the usual problems involving observable effects of large extra - dimensions are eliminated because the standard model fields live on a fixed three dimensional space - like hyper - surface ( the d - brane ) and are thus impervious to the extra dimensions .",
    "this led to a flurry of model building , including new solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "many of these models were discussed by other lecturers at this school@xcite .",
    "my purpose here will be to treat these models from the point of view of effective field theories .",
    "please note that i will be abusing the term @xmath489 throughout the rest of these lectures .",
    "you many substitute the term @xmath489 with a `` domain wall of planck scale thickness '' for the purposes of these lectures .",
    "let us consider a generic theory on a manifold @xmath223 which can be written as a direct product @xmath490 where @xmath491 is some @xmath492 dimensional compact manifold .",
    "we will assume for simplicity that there is only one relevant scale which characterizes @xmath491 , namely @xmath493 .",
    "so we would expect that for energies less than @xmath494 , the effects of the compact extra dimensions should be suppressed by @xmath495 .",
    "let us study a @xmath496 dimensional gauge theory on this manifold where the coupling will have dimensions @xmath497=-d/2.\\ ] ] furthermore , naturalness tells us that @xmath498 . since for @xmath499",
    "the coupling is dimensionful , we would call this theory `` non - renormalizable '' in the old fashioned language . in our parlance",
    "we would simply say that its only an effective field theory , with limited predictive power .",
    "we would expect that this description of the theory would only correctly describe the physics up to a scale of order @xmath500 .",
    "typically the theory should contain a whole tower of higher dimensional operators which are suppressed by powers of @xmath173 , which all become equally important when we have external momenta on this scale .",
    "now before going on i should say that the above conclusions need not necessarily hold .",
    "in particular , there could be a strongly coupled fixed point , where our power counting would break down .",
    "indeed , as i previously mentioned , it is believed that there are five and six dimension supersymmetric yang - mills theories with 16 supercharges which posses non - trivial fixed points , although it is not known how to give lagrangian descriptions of these theories .",
    "our argument in the previous paragraph seems to exclude this possibility .",
    "so where is the loophole ?",
    "the answer , is that our power counting arguments were all based upon reasoning which only necessarily holds at weak coupling . at strong coupling",
    "the power counting can change . while its not clear how this happens in the higher dimensional susy theories , there is a nice example in three dimensions @xcite which illustrates a mechanism by which naive power counting breaks down .",
    "consider the theory of @xmath113 fermions in three dimensions interacting via a four fermi interaction @xmath501 in three dimensions the coupling @xmath502 has mass dimensions @xmath503 .",
    "so naively this theory is only an effective theory and breaks down at the scale @xmath504 .",
    "however , it has been shown that in the large @xmath113 limit this is not the case .",
    "the conclusion that the theory is non - renormalizable was deduced from a weak coupling analysis .",
    "we know that quantum corrections can lead to scaling modifications .",
    "typically , we study weakly coupled theory , where the quantum corrections only change the power counting by logs . but in strong coupling it can happen that this naive power counting breaks down , and a theory which we thought was non - renormalizable can indeed be renormalizable .",
    "this is exactly what happens if you study ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) in the large @xmath113 limit .",
    "the way this comes about is seen by re - writing ( [ 2 + 1 ] ) in terms of an auxiliary scalar field @xmath505 now naively , the @xmath506 propagator is constant .",
    "however , in the large @xmath113 limit we are forced to resum sets of diagrams , and in doing so the @xmath506 propagator scales as @xmath507 , if the bare coupling satisfies a certain bound .",
    "given this scaling it is not hard , using textbook arguments , to show that all the divergences can be absorbed using only the operators shown in ( [ aux ] ) .",
    "this means that we can naturally set all the higher dimension operators in the action to zero without worrying that we will regenerate them via quantum corrections .",
    "the point of this little diversion was just to let the reader know that sometimes field theories can actually be more than just effective , they may be complete .",
    "the trouble is that the strong coupling , which is necessary to generate large anomalous dimensions , makes it difficult to perform controlled approximations .",
    "so finding strongly coupled fixed points is a difficult task .",
    "i should also point out , that even without such a fixed point , there could well be a field theoretic description of the theory above the cut - off in terms of a different set of variables .",
    "for instance , the underlying theory could consist of a quiver gauge theory @xcite .",
    "returning now to our non - renormalizable effective gauge theory , it actually turns out that there are simple arguments which lead to the conclusion that the scale at which the effective theory breaks down is numerically enhanced relative to the compactification scale by a geometrical factor .",
    "these arguments are based on what is called  naive dimensional analysis \" which was first discussed in the context of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "a discussion of nda within the context of super - symmetric theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "the basic argument goes as follows .",
    "suppose we wish to calculate some n - point function ( @xmath508 ) in a non - renormalizable field theory .",
    "generically there will be a tree level contribution from some unknown counter - term ( @xmath509 ) , as well as some calculable ( in terms of lower order coefficients ) non - analytic terms which arise from loop corrections .",
    "both contributions will be suppressed by powers of the uv scale @xmath173 .",
    "furthermore , dimensional analysis tells us that there is a correlation between the order in the loop expansion at which the observable is generated and the dimensionality of the operator which contributes to the observable at tree level .",
    "schematically the amplitude @xmath223 can be written as @xmath510 here the piece proportional to @xmath509 is the contribution from some local operator , while the log piece comes from a loop integral involving lower order interactions whose couplings are related to @xmath511 by a geometric factor generated by the loop integration ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "that is , if @xmath512 is the lower order coupling then @xmath513 .",
    "the divergence will get absorbed into @xmath509 .",
    "the momentum @xmath16 represents some generic set of external momenta .",
    "varying the renormalization scale on a interval of order one generates an effective change in result of order @xmath514 .",
    "this is roughly equivalent to the statement that even if we set @xmath509 to zero at tree level , it will be generated at the loop level .",
    "thus , we would expect that the size of the counter - term is thus naturally of order @xmath515 .",
    "now given that the log arises from a loop , @xmath86 is just a geometric factor which comes about from the angular integration and is of the form @xmath516 where @xmath517 and @xmath242 are a function of the number of dimensions .",
    "thus nda tells us that the cut - off is more like @xmath518 instead of @xmath173 .",
    "while this does not seem like a huge distinction , the chiral lagrangian description of low energy qcd would be far less powerful if it were no for this factor of @xmath519 .",
    "it is important to realize that nda is a naturalness argument and assumes that couplings are all of order one . as such",
    ", it should only be taken as a guiding principle .",
    "let us now see how this works for a @xmath496 dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "the leading interaction is suppressed by @xmath520 , so that any loop contribution to the effective action will be suppressed by @xmath521 . following the argument in the previous paragraph ,",
    "let us compare the tree level contribution to the photon two point function arising from the higher dimensional operator @xmath522 to the contribution arising from loop corrections .",
    "the one loop correction to the two point function arising from interaction with a massless field is just the usual vacuum polarization graph , which in @xmath496 dimensions is given by @xmath523.\\ ] ] where , as usual @xmath524 .",
    "first we notice that the result only diverges in even dimensions .",
    "we could have guessed that since in odd dimensions there are no allowed ( i.e. analytic ) counter - terms which could absorb the divergence .",
    "so in odd dimensions we can not use this particular calculation to learn anything from nda . in even dimensions ,",
    "e.g. @xmath525 , we would conclude that the true cut - off is not @xmath526 but @xmath527 .",
    "notice that i did nt worry about the overall constants in ( [ o_2 ] ) .",
    "the full result could include group theory factors or gamma functions which might arise from doing feynman parameter integrals .",
    "however , as i said before , nda is only supposed to give you a rough guess of the true cut - off .",
    "i would not wager much on its exactness , but it does make qualitative sense that the cut - off will in general be enhanced by a geometric factor , which grows with the dimensionality . .3 in * exercise 3.1 * using a physical argument determine whether one would expect the nda guess for the strong coupling scale to change due to compactification .",
    ".3 in      it is interesting to try to understand the force law in a compactified version of a @xmath492 dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "let us calculate @xmath528 a la exercise 1.6 for a five dimensional gauge theory compactified on an @xmath529 with radius @xmath493 .",
    "if we kk reduce the theory ( i am assuming here that the reader is familiar with kk reduction , otherwise see @xcite ) , then the force will get contributions from zero mode as well as kk mode exchange between our heavy sources . for distances",
    "much larger than @xmath493 we would expect that only the zero mode force is non - negligible since the kk modes , whose masses scale with @xmath530 , mediate a yukawa force which dies off exponentially fast @xmath531 . thus , in this regime , we reproduce the four dimensional result , with a rescaled coupling @xmath532 .",
    "the rescaling arises from the the norm of the zero mode . on the other hand , for @xmath533",
    ", we can consider a whole tower of effectively massless @xmath534 kk modes each of which will contribute to the force .",
    "thus , qualitatively we would expect the following behavior for the one loop force law at tree level @xmath535 how will this result be modified by quantum corrections ? at large @xmath536",
    "we know that we should be dominated by external zero modes as well as zero modes in the loop .",
    "whereas at small @xmath533 we will get contributions not only from corrections to zero mode exchange but also from corrections to the exchange of external kk modes as well . at large @xmath242",
    "the dominant correction will arise from the pure zero mode vacuum polarization diagram which generates a correction of the form @xmath537 whereas dimensional analysis tells us that the correction to the full five dimensional potential , at small @xmath242 , will be of the form @xmath538 so that at small @xmath242 the quantum corrections dominate the classical result as per our previous discussion",
    ".    now let s do an honest calculation to see what the exact result looks like . instead of calculating the full five dimensional potential , i will concentrate on the potential generated by external zero modes and its correction .",
    "the reason being that this will be the relevant object to calculate when we discuss grand unification .",
    "i will do the calculation in two ways .",
    "first by working exactly in five dimensions , and then by matching and running , as discussed in the first lecture .",
    "i will specialize to the case of scalar qed for simplicity . in this case",
    "there are two contributions to the vacuum polarization .",
    "the result for a massless scalar can be written as @xcite @xmath539\\equiv ( p_\\mu p_\\nu - p^2 g_{\\mu \\nu})\\pi(p^2 ) .",

    "this is because dimensional regularization sets the power divergence to zero .",
    "this finiteness may seem strange given that each mode gives a divergent contribution .",
    "what happens is that the sum of the poles cancels .",
    "also , we would expect that at long distances we should exactly reproduce the four dimensional non - analytic behavior .",
    "so if we expand for small values of the momentum we should get a log and nothing else non - analytic . defining @xmath541 , and expanding the log",
    "we find @xmath542 where the rest of the series contains only even powers of @xmath131 .",
    "the first term in the expansion cancels the power dependence , the second term is the 4-d log and the higher order terms are analytic . at @xmath543 , the result",
    "is dominated by the power dependence and taking the fourier transform of the first term in the dyson series we get back the radius independent result we would expect from dimensional analysis ( [ 5dqm ] ) .",

    "if we are interested in the two point function at the scale @xmath16 , then we should sum over all the kk modes with masses less than that scale .",
    "each mode will contribute a @xmath545 along with some scheme dependent constant .",
    "it seems clear how the linear dependence on @xmath16 will arise from summing over the constant pieces , but how does the @xmath546 dependence becomes power - like ?",
    "suppose we have measured the coupling at some scale below the first kk mass @xmath547 .",
    "to predict the coupling at @xmath548 , we run the coupling to the scale @xmath547 using the four dimensional beta function , then we match , at the scale @xmath547 , onto a theory which contains the zero mode as well as the first kk mode .",

    "since we are only interested in the log piece let us ignore additive constants in the matching ( even though in this particular case the constants are of the same order as the logs , so this calculation does not follow the standard systematics ) .",
    "thus , at the order we are working we may use the relation @xmath550 where @xmath551 is the beta function for one massless particle , and @xmath552 counts the number of massless particles in the theory . so the value of the coupling in a theory with @xmath552 kk modes , @xmath553 , at the scale @xmath554 is given by @xmath555 where i have used the fact that @xmath556 and dropped higher order terms in the couplings since @xmath557 is not a large log .",

    "that is , an order one variation in the matching scale ( [ match ] ) changes the result by an amount of order one .",
    "usually such a variation would lead to a subleading correction , but in this case the power law behavior leads to linear sensitivity to the uv physics .",
    "one of the first uses of effective field theories was in the context of grand unification @xcite . in the standard model",
    "the couplings approach each other near the scale @xmath566 gev , and in the minimal super - symmetric standard model ( mssm ) the coupling are within errors of unifying .",

    "the world volume theory of a d - brane can be described by a gauge theory which lives on the brane .",

    "as far as the weak mixing angle is concerned , this log is irrelevant , as it is universal ( meaning it contributes to all the couplings identically ) since it depends only upon the geometry .",
    "so that is a first step in understanding the result ( [ eq : adsmpi ] ) , but the real challenge in understanding the logarithmic mass dependence . from a four dimensional perspective",
    "this term looks like it s coming from a heavy scalar which decouples at its mass scale ( compare to the result in section 3.4 ) . in terms of the planck brane correlator",
    "we can understand this from the following remarkable fact .",
    "all of the kk modes with masses much less than @xmath183 , save for one , are localized to the tev brane while the external gauge boson lines in the self energy die off exponentially fast as one moves away from the planck brane .",
    "so the net contribution of the kk modes to the symmetry breaking effects is suppressed relative to contribution of a single mode . the modes with masses larger than @xmath183 contribute in a symmetric way and thus only affect the unmeasurable counter - term .",
    "the one special mode has a mass near the value of the bulk mass . in the massless case",
    "this mode is the zero mode , which is flat , while in the massive case there is a `` magic mode '' which has support near the planck brane @xcite .",
    "let us see how this happens quantitatively . in the limit @xmath704 @xmath705",
    "we see the exponential suppression of the gauge field propagator .",
    "this suppression will kill the contribution of the tev brane localized kk modes .",
    "however , one must be careful to note that there is regulator dependence in this statement .",
    "a more precise statement would be that the non - analytic momentum dependence generated by the kk modes is exponentially small .",
    "i will refer the reader to reference @xcite for more details .    for the case of gauge fields and fermions",
    ", the suppression of the kk modes does not follow this argument , as they are not in general tev brane localized .",
    "in fact , the contributions from these modes are only logarithmically suppressed .",
    "that is , they look like they contribute to the two loop beta function .",
    "this can be seen from studying the non - decoupling calculation for gauge field @xcite . but given that these effects are of the same order as the usual unknown threshold effects , they wo nt change the prediction for the weak mixing angle @xcite . to understand",
    "this behavior from a non - decoupling argument one can use arguments based on ads / cft , but these are beyond the scope of these lectures . at this point",
    "i should also mention that the gauge fields differ from scalar fields in another important way .",
    "the one loop calculation for a gauge field with mass @xmath706 gives a contribution of the form @xmath707 so that the effective mass is _ parametrically _ enhanced @xcite , though numerically , this effect is small unless we are willing to tolerate a large hierarchy between @xmath183 and @xmath706 .",
    "let s now consider the effects of the higher dimensional operators on our prediction for the weak mixing angle , as they could perhaps ruin our predictive power .",
    "any higher dimensional operator which is insensitive to the symmetry breaking masses will obviously not affect the prediction .",
    "these higher dimensional operators would all correspond to some universal contribution to the couplings and thus be irrelevant for the difference which determines the mixing angle .",
    "it is also possible that there are higher dimensional operators such as @xmath708 which would be sensitive to the symmetry breaking if @xmath645 got an expectation value .",
    "however , since @xmath709 these terms will be suppressed by powers of @xmath710 and thus negligible .",
    "so higher dimensional operators are not a problem , and it seems that we will be able to predict the weak mixing angle .    the net result of this discussion is that one can understand how ads can lead to a successful prediction of the weak mixing angle .",
    "the high energy behavior of the planck brane correlator looks four dimensional .",
    "in addition to the logs which arise from zero modes of bulk fields there is a `` tree - level '' log which is purely geometric and does not contribute to the mixing angle prediction . scaling down the planck brane correlators , one then matches onto the zero mode correlators which are related to the physical measurement .",
    "it is quite exciting to think about unification in @xmath711 because one would expect to see @xmath712 symmetry violating processes at the tev scale .",
    "recent progress in model building in this direction can be found @xcite .",

    "manhanthappa for organizing yet another fruitful tasi meeting .",
    "i would also like to thank the ucsd theory group for its hospitality , as well as iain stewart and especially walter goldberger for comments on the manuscript .    0",
    "the basic ideas behind effective field theory go back to wilson s original work .",

    "<S> these notes are a written version of a set of lectures given at tasi-02 on the topic of effective field theories . </S>",
    "<S> they are meant as an introduction to some of the latest techniques and applications in the field .    </S>",
    "<S> * prelude *    it is a little known fact that the pioneer spacecraft launched in the mid - seventies contains a data repository with a summary of human scientific knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask what would happen if an alien civilization found this satellite and studied its contents ? </S>",
    "<S> let us furthermore suppose that while these aliens were / are greatly advanced technologically , they are not terribly well versed in basic research , mainly because of the alien government s short - sightedness and are thus very interested in the free knowledge that we are offering them . </S>",
    "<S> one of the pieces of information in the data repository is a copy of the particle data group booklet ( the hand sized one , not the tome ) . </S>",
    "<S> the booklet is handed over to the relevant scientists , and a massive project is launched to decipher the information . </S>",
    "<S> after a couple of years of going over the data and a copy of bjorken and drell , which was also on board , the aliens are up to speed and ready to test our theories . </S>",
    "<S> they ve come to the conclusion that we claim to have a well defined theory of strong and electro - weak interactions up to the tev scale ( let s not quibble over anachronisms ) , and that while we do nt know exactly what happens at the tev scale there is something that unitarizes the theory above that scale . </S>",
    "<S> they also conclude that our understanding of gravity is very limited . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> while we know how to calculate quantum corrections at energies which are small compared to the planck scale , above the planck scale we have no idea what is going on .    </S>",
    "<S> after some period of intense investigations , the aliens decide to test the theoretical predictions based on what they learned from us . </S>",
    "<S> a proposal is put forward by a prominent experimentalist for a high precision measurement of the level splittings in hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal is summarily rejected based on a review written by a top alien theorist . </S>",
    "<S> the rejection was based on the referee s argument that it is silly to try to calculate loop corrections in the human s field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the referee s justification for this statement is that given that gravitons run through the loops and the fact the integrals include momenta above the planck scale , where we know the theory breaks down , there is no way that one can expect that the results will be correct . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , even if gravitational couplings are suppressed by the planck scale , there are power law divergences which can compensate for these suppressions , so it seems that any attempt at calculating loop corrections would be fruitless . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , for us , there were some wise aliens working at the funding agency , and they said ,  </S>",
    "<S> let s for the moment ignore gravitational effects , and see if the data agrees with what we get using just electro - magnetic effects \" . </S>",
    "<S> so the experiment was done and the theory did indeed meet with great success .    </S>",
    "<S> so where did the referee go wrong ? </S>",
    "<S> well , to be fair , the referee was not completely wrong . </S>",
    "<S> there is a kernel of truth to its claims . </S>",
    "<S> it is true that the theory breaks down and that we should indeed pause to think about the results of any calculation which involves loop momenta above the planck scale ( the scale where the theory is no longer reliable ) . </S>",
    "<S> since we know we are not correctly portraying the physics at the high scale , whatever the result of the loop integration may be , it will have to be treated in some way so as to remove the dependence on the uv physics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the loop integrals will , in general , be divergent and need to be regulated . </S>",
    "<S> but there is no preferred regulation procedure and , therefore , the numerical value of the integral is ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> however , the point the referee missed is that if we are not too ambitious , this is not a problem . </S>",
    "<S> the short distance physics , which is not properly accounted for in the loop integrals , looks _ local _ at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> another way of saying this is , that if we think of the loop integral in coordinate space , the part of the integral from which we know we are getting nonsense can be contracted to a point and therefore looks like an insertion of a local operator into our feynman diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this means that all of the effects of the unknown short distance physics can be mimicked by adding some new operators into our lagrangian ( as we will see these operators may be of arbitrarily high dimensions ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , all the effects of the short distance physics can be accounted for by either shifting the parameters in our renormalizable lagrangian , or by adding higher dimensional operators which are suppressed by the uv scale , @xmath0 . since we needed to perform measurements to fix those parameters </S>",
    "<S> anyway we still have predictivity as long as we truncate the lagrangian at some order in powers of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> so we see now in what way the referee was right . </S>",
    "<S> it s not that the unknown effects of the short distance physics are parametrically small in any way , indeed these effects are very important as they contribute at order one to the parameters in the renormalizable part of the lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> it s that all the effects go into making up the electron mass and all the other low energy parameters of the theory . if you changed the short distance physics it could , and would , change the values of the low energy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as long as we are not too ambitious , we do nt need to worry about the fact that our integrals diverge ! who cares </S>",
    "<S> if they diverge , we did nt expect to get the answer </S>",
    "<S> right anyway . </S>",
    "<S> so we should really call our field theories  effective \" field theories . </S>",
    "<S> this moniker warns the consumer that it should be used with caution , as at some scale the theory no longer makes any sense . </S>",
    "<S> what that scale is depends upon the interactions one is trying to describe .    </S>",
    "<S> let s for the moment consider a universe where the effects of short distance physics could _ not _ be absorbed into low energy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we could nt calculate _ anything _ without knowing the complete theory of quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> while , this line of reasoning seems almost obvious now , thinking in terms of effective field theories ( eft ) only became generally accepted in the last few decades . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , from an eft point of view , renormalizability , which was a standard benchmark for acceptable quantum field theories not that long ago , is no longer relevant , unless we re interested in theories which are supposed to correctly describe all the short distance physics . </S>",
    "<S> does this mean that field theory as a mathematical construct is incapable of being a  complete \" theory ? </S>",
    "<S> certainly not . </S>",
    "<S> there are many field theories which are valid to arbitrarily high scales . </S>",
    "<S> the classic examples being asymptotically free theories such as qcd . </S>",
    "<S> these theories possess trivial uv fixed points , which allow for the cut - off to be taken to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the necessary criteria for completeness is the existence of a uv fixed point , and taking the cut - off to infinity is called taking the  continuum limit \" , following the lattice terminology . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning behind this criteria is that at the fixed point , the correlation length @xmath2 , ( read inverse mass ) diverges , and thus one can study physics at arbitrarily large distances compared to the cut - off ( the inverse of the lattice spacing @xmath3 ) , which is equivalent to saying that the cut - off can be taken to infinity since lattice artifacts will be suppressed by powers of @xmath4@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course if we want a  theory of everything \" , it ca nt be asymptotically free since we know that gravity should become stronger in the uv . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any quantum field theory description of gravity should possess a non - trivial uv fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is very difficult , or perhaps impossible to rule out . </S>",
    "<S> presently , the consensus is that it may well be that a local quantum field theory is not capable of describing physics at and above the planck scale </S>",
    "<S> . however , field theory is profoundly rich , and i would guess it still possesses many tricks which have yet to be revealed to us . </S>"
