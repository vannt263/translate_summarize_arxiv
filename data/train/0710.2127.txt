    "88 tau ( hd 29140 , hr 1458 , hip 21402 ) is a bright ( @xmath1 ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , nearby ( @xmath2pc ) hierarchical sextuple stellar system @xcite .",
    "the a component contains a pair of systems ( designated aa and ab ) in an @xmath3-year @xcite orbit that has been resolved by speckle interferometry @xcite .",
    "the aa component is a known spectroscopic binary system ( @xmath4-day ) , with a composite spectral type of a5 m @xcite . in previous work",
    "it had been noted @xcite that the a system is likely complex , with possibly as many as 5 components .",
    "@xcite noted a discrepancy between the total estimated mass of this system based on photometry and spectral types , and the total mass derived from the visual orbit and _ hipparcos _ parallax . in this work",
    "we have determined that , like the aa component , the ab component is a double - lined binary ; this newly - resolved binary has a period of 7.89 days .",
    "finally , there is a common - proper - motion companion , labeled b , located @xmath069 arcseconds away from the a system ; it , too , is known to be a binary @xcite . for clarity",
    "we provide a schematic of this complex system in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "there are several reasons why multiple stellar systems such as 88 tau merit attention : first , binary orbits make it possible to measure accurate stellar masses and distances , while the larger number of presumably co - eval stars allows one to impose the additional constraint that any given model must accurately match all of the stars .",
    "this approach has proven particularly fruitful when applied to another famous hierarchical sextuple system : castor@xcite .",
    "second , as outlined in @xcite , the relative orientations of the orbital angular momenta allow one to constrain the properties of the cloud from which the stars are thought to have formed , as well as the subsequent dynamical decay process . despite their value , observational problems have limited the number of triple or higher - order systems with accurately measured orbits to fewer than 10 .",
    "given their hierarchical nature it is often the case that either the close system is unresolvable or the outer system has an impractically long orbital period .    with the advent of long - baseline stellar interferometry , and more recently phase - referenced long - baseline interferometric astrometry @xcite capable of 1020 @xmath5-arcsecond astrometric precision between pairs of stars with separations in the range 0.051 arcsecond , it has become possible to resolve the orbital motion of several interesting multiple systems @xcite .",
    "here we report on astrometric and radial velocity measurements of the 88 tau a system , which allow us to constrain the orbits of the 3.57-day , 7.89-day and 18-year components with improved precision , and for the first time provide a relative orientation of the orbits as well as component masses .",
    "astrometric measurements were made with the palomar testbed interferometer @xcite as part of the palomar high - precision astrometric search for exoplanet systems ( phases ) program @xcite .",
    "the palomar testbed interferometer is located on palomar mountain near san diego , ca .",
    "it was developed by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology for nasa as a testbed for interferometric techniques applicable to the keck interferometer and the space interferometry mission ( sim ) .",
    "it operates in the j ( 1.2 @xmath5 m ) , h ( 1.6 @xmath5 m ) , and k ( 2.2 @xmath5 m ) bands and combines starlight from two out of three available 40 cm apertures .",
    "the apertures form a triangle with 86 and 110 m baselines .",
    "88 tau a was successfuly observed with pti on 29 nights in 20042007 with the use of the phase - referenced fringe - scanning mode @xcite developed for high - precision astrometry ; the data were reduced with the algorithms described therein , as well as with the modifications described in @xcite .",
    "the obtained differential astrometry is listed in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "note that the astrometry on any single night is essentially that of a single - baseline interferometer , yielding a very small error in the direction aligned with the baseline , but limited to the effect of earth - rotation synthesis in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the median minor - axis formal uncertainty is 10 @xmath5arcseconds , while the median major - axis uncertainty is 312 @xmath5arcseconds . to properly weight the data set when doing a combined fit with previous astrometry and radial velocity data , we fit an orbital model to the phases astrometry by itself , and rescaled the formal uncertainties so as to yield a reduced @xmath6 of unity ; the resulting scale factor was 2.5 , indicating a substantial amount of excess scatter beyond the internal error estimates .",
    "we do not believe this scatter to be due to the effect of starspots , given that the _ hipparcos _ photometry of this system indicates a scatter of no more than 5 mmag ; the resulting maximum starspot - induced astrometric noise would be @xmath7arcseconds @xcite .",
    "we have however identified possible instrumental sources of this systematic error and developed methods for reducing it , see @xcite . nevertheless , the existing astrometry is sufficient to detect astrometric motion induced by the short - period subsystems .",

    "its velocity of 27.9 km  s@xmath8 was adopted from @xcite .",
    "lines in the wavelength region redward of 6445  are not particularly suitable for measurement because most features are blends , and there are a number of modest strength water vapor lines .",

    "a full mass - period phase space search for a fifth component is computationally prohibitive and beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "however , through the course of the investigation , we discovered a possible periodicity that warranted follow - up .",
    "before we had determined the 7.89 day period of the ab1-ab2 system , we had searched the phases data for this third orbit signal with the period - searching program used to find the signatures of additional companions@xcite ; because the aa - ab and aa1-aa2 periods were known already , these orbits were seeded at their best fit double kepler values . while radial velocities eventually isolated the period for ab1-ab2 as 7.89 days , this astrometric search additionally identified a curious improvement near 56 days .",
    "the size of that orbit could have corresponded either to a brown dwarf or to a nearly equal luminosity star - star subsystem .",
    "inspired by this identification , a 5-component , quadruple keplerian model was seeded with the three known orbits ( aa - ab , aa1-aa2 , and ab1-ab2 ) and a fourth perturbation with a period of 56 days .",

    "the 3 subclass difference between the calcium k line type and metal line type indicates that this star is a marginal or mild am star @xcite .",

    "a fit with hr 483 , spectral type g1.5 v @xcite , used as a proxy for the 7.89 day binary pair , was nearly as good .",

    "<S> we have used high precision differential astrometry from the palomar high - precision astrometric search for exoplanet systems ( phases ) project and radial velocity measurements covering a time - span of 20 years to determine the orbital parameters of the 88 tau a system . </S>",
    "<S> 88 tau is a complex hierarchical multiple system comprising a total of six stars ; we have studied the brightest 4 , consisting of two short - period pairs orbiting each other with an @xmath018-year period . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first orbital solution for one of the short - period pairs , and determine the masses of the components and distance to the system to the level of a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our astrometric measurements allow us to make the first determination of the mutual inclinations of the orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sub - systems are not coplanar . </S>"
