    "underwater source detection and localization is an important but challenging problem .",
    "classical range - based or energy - based source localization algorithms usually require energy - decay models and the knowledge of the environment @xcite .",
    "however , critical environment parameters may not be available in many underwater applications , in which case , classical model - dependent methods may break down , even when the measurement snr is high .",
    "there have been some studies on source localization using nonparametric machine learning techniques , such as kernel regressions and support vector machines @xcite .",
    "however , these methods either require a large amount of sensor data , or some implicit information of the environment , such as the choice of kernel functions .",
    "for example , determining the best kernel parameters ( such as bandwidth ) is very difficult given a small amount of data .",
    "this paper focuses on source detection and localization problems when only some structural properties of the energy field generated by the sources are available .",
    "specifically , instead of requiring the knowledge of how energy decays with distance to the source , the paper aims at exploiting only the assumption that the closer to the source the higher energy received , and moreover , the energy field of the source is spatially invariant and decomposable .",
    "in fact , such a structural property is generic in many underwater applications .",
    "the prior work @xcite studied the single source case , where an observation matrix is formed from a few energy measurements of the field in the target area , and the missing entries of the observation matrix are filled using matrix completion methods . knowing that the matrix would be rank-1 under full and noise - free sampling of the whole area , svd is applied to extract the dominant singular vectors , and the source location is inferred from analyzing the peaks of the singular vectors .",
    "herein , we propose to improve upon two shortcomings in @xcite : we make rigorous an estimation / localization bound ( versus focusing on the reduction of the search region ) and we provide a method for localizing two sources . in the two source case",
    ", we need to tackle an additional difficulty that the svd of the observation matrix does not correspond to the signature vectors of the sources . to resolve this issue , a method of rotated eigenstructure analysis",
    "is proposed , where the observation matrix is formed by rotating the coordinate system such that the sources are aligned in a row or in a column of the matrix .",
    "we develop algorithms to first localize the central axis of the two sources , and then separate the sources on the central axis .    to summarize ,",
    "we derive algorithms to simultaneously localize up to two sources based on only a few power measurements in the target area without knowing any specific energy - decay model .",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows :    * we derive the location estimators with analytical results to show that the squared error decreases at a rate @xmath0 for a gaussian field with a single source , where @xmath1 scales proportionally to the number of samples @xmath2 .",
    "* we develop a localization algorithm for the double source case based on a novel rotated eigenstructure analysis .",
    "we show that the two sources can be separated even when their aggregate power field has a single peak .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we insist on several features of the algorithm to be developed : it should be robust to structural knowledge of the signatures of the sources ( as captured by @xmath50 in ( [ eq : structure - power - density - func ] ) ) .",
    "this disallows the use of parametric regression or parameter estimation for source localization .",
    "in addition , we wish to under - sample the target area using small @xmath2 . as such",

    "<S> herein , the problem of simultaneous localization of two sources given a modest number of samples is examined . in particular , the strategy does not require knowledge of the target signatures of the sources _ a priori _ , nor does it exploit classical methods based on a particular decay rate of the energy emitted from the sources as a function of range . </S>",
    "<S> general structural properties of the signatures such as unimodality are exploited . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm localizes targets based on the rotated eigenstructure of a reconstructed observation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the optimal rotation can be found by maximizing the ratio of the dominant singular value of the observation matrix over the nuclear norm of the optimally rotated observation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this ratio has a unique local maximum leading to computationally efficient search algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , analytical results are developed to show that the squared localization error decreases at a rate @xmath0 for a gaussian field with a single source , where @xmath1 scales proportionally to the number of samples @xmath2 . </S>"
