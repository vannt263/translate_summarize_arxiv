    "as is now well known , there is space - time singularity under certain conditions@xmath1}$ ] .",
    "these conditions fall into three categories .",
    "first , there is the requirement that gravity shall be attractive .",
    "secondly , there is the requirement that there is enough matter present in some region to prevent anything escaping from that region .",
    "the third requirement is that there should be no causality violations .",
    "because of the theorems , there must be space - time singularity in the conventional theory .",
    "on the other hand , there should be no space - time singularity in physics .",
    "hence this problem must be solved .",
    "recent astronomical observations show that the universe expanded with a deceleration earlier while is expanding with an acceleration now .",

    "thus , issue of the cosmological constant is open as well .",
    "huge voids in the cosmos have been observed@xmath23}.$ ] the model in which the hot dark matter ( e.g. neutrinos ) is major can explain the phenomenon , however , it can not explain the structure with middle and small scales . hence this is an open problem as well .",
    "we consider that all important existing forms of matter , dark matter and dark energy , to be presented .",
    "hence the basic problems , e.g. divergence problem in quantum field theory , cosmological constant and space - time singularity problems in cosmology , should be solved based on the important existing forms of matter .",
    "we have constructed a quantum field theory without divergence by dark matter .",
    "we construct a model of the universe without singularity in the paper by dark energy .",
    "we consider the following conditions 1 and 2 to be necessary in order to solve the singularity and the cosmological constant problems in the basis of the classical cosmology and the frame of the conventional quantum field theory .",
    "the third condition is necessary to cause the space inflation .",
    "condition 1 : :    there are two sorts of matter which are symmetric , whose gravitational    masses are opposite to each other and whose energies are all positive .",
    "the two sorts of matter are called @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the condition implies that if @xmath26 @xmath27    condition 2 : :    when temperature is high enough , the thermal equilibrium between the    two sorts of matter can come into being , @xmath28 and    @xmath29 can transform from one into another so that    @xmath30 .",
    "condition 3 : :    @xmath31  and    @xmath32when @xmath33 here    @xmath34 is the critical temperature .    the conditions 1 and 2 can not be realized in the conventional theory . in order to uniformly solve the above four problems on one basis , we present new conjectures ( see section 2 ) and construct a cosmological model on the basis of the conjectures@xmath35}$ ] .    the basic idea of the present model is the conjecture 1 , which realizes the conditions consequently there is no singularity of space - time and @xmath36 is proven , although @xmath9 is still very large .",
    "thus , there is no the fine tuning problem , even if @xmath37 .",
    "there are two sorts of breaking modes which are called @xmath38 and @xmath39 due to the conjecture 1 .",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41 or @xmath42 are all possible due to the conjecture 1 . hence the curvature factor @xmath43 in the @xmath44 metric should be changeable .",
    "we consider @xmath43 to be a function of @xmath45 @xmath46 is the gravitational mass density in comoving coordinates , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "the evolving equations corresponding to @xmath48 have been derived@xmath35}$ ] .",
    "an important basis of the present model is the temperature effect on expectation values of higgs fields .",
    "the present model have the following results .    according to the present model ,",
    "the evolving process of space is as follows .    in the @xmath49 space contracts @xmath50temperature @xmath51 rises to the highest temperature @xmath52 and the highest symmetry comes into being @xmath50 space inflation @xmath50 reheating process @xmath53 the state with the highest symmetry transits to the state with the @xmath39 and space expands with a deceleration",
    "@xmath50 then comes to static @xmath50 finally expands with an acceleration up to now .",
    "@xmath54 can change from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "there are the critical temperature @xmath34 , the highest temperature @xmath57 , the least scale @xmath58 and the largest energy density @xmath59 in the universe . @xmath58 and @xmath34 are two new important constants , @xmath52 and @xmath60 are determined by @xmath61 .",
    "a formula comes out which well describes the relation between a luminosity distance and its redshift .",
    "the new predictions of the present model are as follows .",
    "@xmath62 voids in the @xmath39 are not empty , but there is @xmath24 with its density @xmath63 in them .",
    "their effects are similar to those of huge concave lenses for @xmath64 . in huge voids , both matter and dark matter are even shorter in the huge void .",
    "thus the density of hydrogen in the huge voids must be more less that that predicted by the conventional theory .",
    "right or mistake of the predict can be confirmed by the observation of distribution of hydrogen .",
    "when the distance between two @xmath65 is very large , the gravitation between both will be less than that predicted by the conventional theory , because there must be @xmath24 between both .",
    "we generalize equations governing nonrelativistic fluid motion to present model .",
    "the equations of structure formation have been derived . according to the equations",
    ", galaxies can form earlier and easier than that in the conventional theory .    on the basis of this model ,",
    "we have three guesses .    the universe is composed of infinite @xmath66 islands and @xmath67 islands .",
    "some huge redshifts ( e.g. the big redshifts of quasi - stellar objects ) are explained as the mass redshifts which is caused by less mass @xmath68 of an electron than given @xmath69 .",
    "it is possible that a @xmath70 hole with its big enough mass and density can transform into a huge white hole by its self - gravitation .",
    "of course , the effects of quantum mechanics , e.g. hawking radiation , must be considered .",
    "but there is no contradiction between the transformation and quantum mechanics .",
    "it seems that there are some difficulties in the present model , e.g. , it seems that this model is not consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis and the @xmath71 data .",
    "it is a misunderstanding .",
    "in fact , in a broad scope of parameters , the primordial nucleosynthesis and @xmath71 can be explained based on the @xmath72 dark matter model ( or the mirror dark matter model ) and this cosmological model .",
    "the first peak of the @xmath73 power spectra is the evidence of existence of the elementary wave .",
    "the elementary wave began at reheating and ended at recombination after @xmath74 years according to the conventional theory . but according to the present model , it is necessary that @xmath75 because the sound speed @xmath76 and @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the period in which @xmath79 descends into @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83  are the physical quantities in the conventional theory . consequently , space - time is open or @xmath84 according to the present model .     in section 2 , action ,",
    "energy - momentum tensor and field equations are presented ; in section 3 , spontaneous breaking of symmetry and the gravitational mass density of the vacuum state are discussed ; in section 4 , evolving equations of space are derived out ; in section 5 , temperature effects are considered ; in section 6 , the inflation process and change of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are discussed ; in section 7 , contraction of space , the highest temperature and inflation of space are considered ; in section 8 , expansion of space after inflation is discussed ; in section 9 , existing and distributive forms of @xmath87 color single states in the @xmath39 are discussed ; in section 10 , dynamics of @xmath88 formation and the distributive form of the @xmath87 color single states are got ; in section 11 , some guesses , new predictions and an inference are given ; in section 12 , the primordial nucleosynthesis is discussed ; in section 14 , cosmic microwave background radiation is explained ; section 14 is the conclusions ; section 15 is discussion about conjecture 1 .",
    "in order to solve the above problems , we propose the following conjectures .    there are two sorts of matter which are called @xmath89 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath90 ( @xmath25 ) , respectively . both are symmetric and their contributions to the einstein tensor",

    "in fact , only the conjecture 1 is essential .",

    "the expectation values of @xmath92 fields are not zero and the expectation values of all @xmath94 fields are zero .",
    "consequently , the @xmath111 symmetry finally breaks into @xmath112 @xmath113 can get their masses and form @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and the @xmath117 symmetry is still strictly kept , all @xmath118 and @xmath119 bosons are massless and must form @xmath117 color - single states when temperature is low .",
