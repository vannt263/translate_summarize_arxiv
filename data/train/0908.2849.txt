    "in more than 50% of the gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) observed with the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , flares were observed at the end of the prompt emission and/or the early ag phase ( see , e.g. , burrows et al .  2005 ; burrows et al .  2007",
    "; falcone et al .  2007 ) .",
    "in some cases x - ray flares were observed also at very late times , of the order of several days after the prompt emission .",
    "flares in grbs were studied phenomenologically by various observer groups ( see , e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; burrows et al .",
    "2007 ; kocevski & butler  2007 ; butler & kocevski  2007 ; falcone et al .  2007 ; chincarini et al .",
    "2007a , b ,  2008a , b , and references therein ) .",
    "modifications of previously suggested models and new theoretical models were proposed and discussed by several authors but none of the proposed models was shown to actually derive the observed spectral and temporal properties of either early - time flares or late - time flares from underlying physical assumptions except for the cannonball model of grbs ( see , e.g. , dado & dar , hereafter dd , 2009b and references therein )",
    ".    flares are a natural consequence of the cannonball ( cb ) model of grbs , which was motivated by a grb - microquasar analogy ( e.g. , dar & de rjula 2004 and references therein , dado , dar & de rjula , hereafter ddd , 2002 ; 2009 ) . in the cb model , _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of highly relativistic plasmoids of ordinary matter ejected in accretion episodes on the newly formed compact stellar object ( shaviv & dar 1995 ; dar  1998 ) in core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosions ( dar et al .  1992 ; dar & plaga 1999 ) .",
    "it is hypothesized that an accretion disk or a torus is produced around the newly formed compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage ( de rjula 1987 ) . as observed in microquasars , each time part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , two jets of cannonballs ( cbs ) made of _ ordinary - matter plasma _ are emitted with large bulk - motion lorentz factors in opposite directions along the rotation axis wherefrom matter has already fallen back onto the compact object due to lack of rotational support .",
    "the prompt @xmath0-ray and x - ray emission is dominated by inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of photons of the sn glory - scattered and/or emitted light by the sn filling the cavity produced by the pre - supernova wind / ejecta which was blown from the progenitor star long before the grb .",
    "the cbs electrons compton up - scatter the glory photons into a narrow conical beam of @xmath0 rays along the cbs direction of motion .",
    "an x - ray ` flare ' coincident in time with a prompt @xmath0-ray pulse is simply its low - energy part .",
    "the flares ending the prompt emission and during the early time afterglow is the same : ics of glory photons by the electrons of cbs ejected in late accretion episodes of fall - back matter on the newly formed central object ( e.g. , dar 2006 ) .",
    "the early time x - ray flares without an accompanying detectable @xmath0-ray emission are usually ic flares ( icfs ) produced by cbs with relatively smaller lorentz factors : as the accretion material is consumed , the ` engine ' has a few progressively - weakening dying pangs .",
    "like the lightcurves of the prompt grb pulses , the lightcurves of icfs exhibit a rapid softening during their fast decline phase ( see , e.g. evans et al .",
    "2007,2009 ) .",
    "often , the fast decay of an icf is taken over by synchrotron radiation ( sr ) from the cb s encounter with the wind enclosing the glory light before the take over by the plateau / shallow - decay phase of the afterglow ( ag ) .",
    "the initial expansion of the cbs and the slowing - down of the leading ones by the circumburst matter merge most of them during the afterglow phase into a single leading cb ( dar & de rjula 2004 , ddd2009 ) .",
    "the prompt emission beam of gamma rays ionizes the matter in front of the cb .",
    "the ions continuously impinging on the cb with a relative lorentz factor @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the bulk motion lorentz factor of the cb , generate within it an equipartition turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the intercepted electrons are isotropized and fermi accelerated by these fields and emit isotropic synchrotron radiation in the cb s rest frame , which is doppler boosted and beamed relativistically into a narrow cone with a typical opening angle @xmath2 .",
    "late synchrotron radiation flares ( srfs ) are produced mainly when the cbs encounter winds or density bumps along their path first from the progenitor star and later in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the lightcurve of these flares depends on the unknown density profile of the encountered wind / density bump which can not be predicted a - priori .",
    "but , both the early - time and the late - time srfs have a typical sr spectrum and a weak spectral evolution which are quite different from those of the accretion induced icfs and can be used to identify their origin ",
    "late ejection episodes from the central engine or encounters with density bumps .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the time in the observer frame after the beginning of a flare ( @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the time after trigger and @xmath6 is its value at the beginning of the flare .",
    "the light - curve of a flare , produced by the electrons in a cb by ics of thermal bremsstrahlung photons filling the cavity formed by a wind blown by the progenitor star long before the grb , is generally well approximated by ( ddd2009 and references therein ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant which depends on the cb s baryon number , lorentz and doppler factors , and on the density of the glory light and on the redshift and distance of the grb , and @xmath9 , the peak energy of @xmath10 at time @xmath3 is given roughly by : @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the time ( after the beginning of the flare ) when the ics photon count - rate reaches peak value . for @xmath13 , it satisfies @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the peak energy of the time - integrated spectrum of the flare .",
    "thus , in the cb model , each icf in the grb lightcurve is described by four parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath6 , the beginning time of the pulse when @xmath3 is taken to be 0 .",

    "the sr radiation which is emitted from the encounter of a cb with the wind / ejecta of the progenitor star with a density profile @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 is given approximately by ( ddd2009 , dd2008 ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath5 being the time after trigger and @xmath35 the time of the cb - wind encounter , @xmath36 is the typical slow - down time of the fast cb expansion , @xmath37 , and the exponent describes the decreasing attenuation of the emitted radiation when the cb penetrates the wind , or more likely , the initial rise in the wind density due to an exponential cutoff in the wind ejection if the observed rise in the prompt srf is achromatic .",
    "( a gaussian cutoff , @xmath38 , may be required by very sharp achromatic srfs ) .",
    "note that for @xmath39 the asymptotic decline of an srf is a simple power law , @xmath40 which distinguishes srfs from icfs .",

    "( [ srp ] ) .",
    "however the sr flares are wider and very often blended and the temporal structure is either smotthed or missed because of low temporal resolution ( see , e.g. , figure  1 in bartolini et al  2009 ) .",
