    "the primary mission of the batse instrument was to detect and locate @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "while the 8 detectors had no intrinsic positional sensitivity , burst positions were obtained by triangulation between detectors .",
    "it was realised , prior to launch , that persistent sources of @xmath0-rays could also be observed by using the earth occultation technique @xcite .",
    "this method calculates the source flux by measuring the step in the count rate of each batse detector as a source rises or sets below the earth s limb .",
    "mass modelling is a technique to simulate the background radiation experienced by a space craft @xcite .",
    "the batse mass model ( bamm ) is a geant3 monte - carlo simulation code developed at southampton @xcite .",
    "bamm simulates the expected count rate from cosmic diffuse @xmath0-rays , atmospheric albedo @xmath0-rays and cosmic rays thoughout the orbit .",
    "the position and orientation of the spacecraft relative to the earth are used to filter these results and generate the expected background .",
    "bamm has been used to flat - field the entire 9 year batse data set .",
    "it is thought that the origin of the exceptionally high luminosity of active galaxies is the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole located at the galaxy centre @xcite .",
    "agn typically have highly variable x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "the very short timescale variability indicates that this emission originates from a small region very close to the central engine .",
    "hence the variability of agn yields direct information about the central supermassive black hole .",
    "the crab is one of the brightest @xmath0-ray sources in the sky and is well known for its lack of variability . as",
    "such it is the ideal ` standard candle ' with which to test the flat - fielded data set and explore the capabilities of our methods .",
    "[ fig : crab ] shows the 9 year light curve of the crab in the 30 - 230 kev energy band as measured on a daily basis and with a 53 day moving average fit ; 53 days is the precession period of cgro .",
    "a histogram of this light curve is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : crabhist ] .",
    "the crab appears relatively constant in the light curve , hence the histogram should have a gaussian profile . fitting a gaussian distribution to the histogram",
    "yields a centroid of 1.005 @xmath1 0.002 crabs with a reduced @xmath2@xmath3 of @xmath43 .",
    "examining the residuals of this fit indicates a number of spurious points in the 0.6 - 0.9 crab region which may be the result of an unknown low level systematic , removing these points renders a fit with a @xmath2@xmath3 of 1.3 .",
    "rebinning the data into longer timescale averages , before generating the histogram , allows the estimation of the systematic component of any errors . as the time bins increase in size the standard deviation of the data set would ideally asymptotically approach 0 .",
    "the inset graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : crabhist ] shows that the curve approaches @xmath42.5% , indicating this level of systematic error .",
    "this level is assumed in our studies of agn light curves .",
    "agn are some of the most powerful persistent sources of @xmath0-rays in the observable universe .",
    "however the low fluxes which arrive at earth make them a very challenging subject to observe in this waveband .",
    "the three brightest agn seen in batse are : centaurus a , a radio galaxy ; ngc4151 , a seyfert galaxy ; 3c273 , a blazar . fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] shows the light curves in the batse 20 - 50 kev and 50 - 160 kev band of these agn .",
    "the data have been binned up to 30 day data points in order to minimise any errors .",
    "additionally the rxte - asm 2 - 10 kev light curves are presented , scaled and offset from the batse curves to aid legibility .",
    "[ fig : hard - soft ] is a hard flux - soft flux plot of the three agn showing the flux in the 30 - 50 kev band against that of the 50 - 160 kev band .",
    "the hard and soft batse light curves seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] appear to be well correlated apart from a short , @xmath430 day outburst in the 20 - 50 kev band at tjd @xmath410800 which appears to coincide with a drop in the 50 - 160 kev flux .",
    "however , the 20 - 50 kev flux continues to be correlated with the asm light curve during this period .",
    "this appears to be corroborated by the hard - soft plot where the hard and soft fluxes indicate a positive correlation .",
    "a spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.56 with a probability of chance occurance of p@xmath50.0001 confirms this positive correlation .",
    "the asm light curve follows the general trends exhibited by both of the batse light curves neglecting the outburst at tjd @xmath410800 .",
    "the hard and soft light curves shown in the middle panel of fig .  [ fig : lightcurves ] appear to be well correlated although there appears to be a potential time lag between them of @xmath430 days .",
    "emission in the 50 - 160 kev band initially appears to precede that of the 20 - 50 kev band , however this is not obvious after tjd @xmath48800 . as this lag is on the same time scale as the data binning it is tenuous without a detailed statistical analysis .",
    "the hard - soft plot looks flat as the hard flux appears independent of the soft flux , however , a positive correlation is indicated by a spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.31 with a probability of chance occurance of p@xmath60.002 .      both light curves seen in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] are synchronized and well correlated .",
    "they both show the same general trends .",
    "the hard - soft plot indicates a positive correlation with a spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.45 with a probability of chance occurance of p@xmath50.0001 .    ]",
    "the 9 year batse data set has been flat - fielded using bamm to remove temporal variations in the instrument background .",
    "we have then applied the standard earth occultation technique developed at marshall space flight centre @xcite on the flat - fielded data set and made measurements to the crab nebula and 3 agn : cen a ; ngc4151 ; 3c273 .",
    "the crab light curve exhibits a constant flux of 1.005 @xmath1 0.002 crabs confirming that the flat - fielding had no adverse effect on the data .",
    "additionally , the systematic error of the methods and analysis performed in the generation of the light curve is estimated to be limited to @xmath42.5% .",
    "the agn light curves show that batse is sensitive to the variations in their @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "work is in progress to re - optimise the standard earth occultation technique for use with the flat - fielded data with the intention of improving sensitivity and precision of measurements .",
