    "are observed due to the presence of sn impurity .",

    "we have made the first attempt to explain the observed diversities in the physical properties of these 122 materials due to sn impurity .",
    "our theoretical investigation using first principles density functional theory reveals that in ba122 system , an impurity induced lifshitz transition occurs but such transition is absent in other 122 systems like sr122 and ca122 systems .",

    "a result of degradation of nesting magnetic order becomes weaker which might be the reason of lowering of structural as well as sdw transition temperatures ( t@xmath27 and t@xmath28 ) in sn contaminated ba122 systems . to illustrate the observed lifshitz transition",

    "band structures around @xmath24 , x and y points are shown in first , second and third rows of fig.[bs - vca ] respectively .",

    "observation of lifshitz transition in other high symmetry k points also occur as clearly demonstrated in fig.[bs - vca ] .",
    "this type of transition can create remarkable topological modification of fss , which might be the reason of alteration of superconducting properties of these ba122 systems with sn impurity .",
    "transition of hole like band to electron like band as well as disappearance of electron like band from fermi level ( fl ) would not only modify the shape of the fss but also affect the nesting condition between electron and hole like bands severely . since nesting of fs is directly related to magnetic sdw transition , lowering of observed magnetic transition in sn contaminated ba122 system may be attributed to the electronic topological transition as found from our first principles simulations .",
    "band structures around x and y points reveal that orbital order also got modified in the presence of slightly higher percentages of sn impurities ( @xmath291% ) .",

    "band structures of these pure and impure systems have no qualitative differences . in fig.[bs - vca - sr ] and fig.[bs - vca - ca ] band structure around @xmath24 , x and y points of pure as well as 5% sn contaminated sr122 and ca122 systems have been shown .",
    "there is no sign of lifshitz transition or any kind of electronic topological transition ( ett ) at least up to 5% sn impurity .",
    "and there is almost no change in the nature of orbital ordering between d@xmath26 and d@xmath25 bands around @xmath24 , x and y point with the introduction of sn impurity ( 5% sn ) in sr122 and ca122 systems . since orbital ordering of d@xmath26 and d@xmath25 bands around x and y",
    "points are the major contributors to the structural transition from tetragonal ( high temperature ) to orthorhombic phase ( low temperature ) in 122 systems @xcite , no significant moderation of orbital ordering around x and y points support the experimental observation of the unaffected structural transition temperature in sn induced sr122 and ca122 systems .",
    "lifshitz transition with variation of pressure or doping concentration or even with variation of temperature , plays an important role in 122 fe - based superconductors and is observed experimentally @xcite . thus one must be sure about the fact whether the observed lifshitz transitions are artefacts of sn impurity or not .",

    "shrinkage of electron like fss and surging of hole like fss are worth noticing .",
    "this indicates hole doping.,width=302,height=415 ]    in order to understand the influence of sn doping on various 122 materials it is essential to identify that the band structures of undoped ba122 , sr122 and ca122 systems ( in the orthorhombic phase ) already have significant differences .",
    "as@xmath0 and ( b ) ca@xmath21sn@xmath22fe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems along @xmath23 k - path in the bz . in comparison to fig.[bs - vca - ba - fp ] , 5% sn doped",
    "ca122 system shows insignificant modification in band structure as far as electronic topological transitions are concerned.,width=340,height=415 ]    for ba122 system , electronic bands around @xmath24 point is very close to the fermi level ( fl ) , specially , the flat d@xmath1 band nearly touches the fl .",
    "the other two bands d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 are slightly higher in energy compared to that of the d@xmath1 .",
    "this should be contrasted with that of the sr122 and ca122 systems ( see fig.[bs - vca - ba - fp ] , [ bs - vca - sr - fp ] , [ bs - vca - ca - fp ] ) , where all the d@xmath1 , d@xmath25 and d@xmath26 ) bands are further away from fl .",
    "this is because of the largest size of ba ( 253 pm ) compared to that of sr ( 219 pm ) and ca ( 194 pm ) causing two fe - as layers furthest in ba122 compared to sr122 , ca122 .",
    "as a result ba-122 is more planer compared to others ( see for example , a dimensional crossover of fs in 122 systems @xcite ) resulting a flatter d@xmath1 band near fl it is to be noted that the d@xmath1 band is planar ( @xmath31 ) in nature in contrast to the d@xmath25/d@xmath26 bands .",
    "sn substitution in the m - atoms ( ba / sr / ca ) is an out - of - plane substitution .",
    "ba atom being the largest in size among the m - atoms as well as sn , a few percentage of sn substitution keeps the effective size of the ` virtual m atom ' largest in size in case of ba , smaller in case of sr and the smallest in case of ca .",
    "this would cause vertical movement between the fe - as planes least for sn - doped ba-122 but larger for sn - doped sr-122 and largest for sn - doped ca-122 .",
    "therefore , naturally d@xmath25/d@xmath26 bands would move furthest in case of sn - doped ca-122 whereas least movement to the d@xmath1 bands ( see for example , figures 3 , 6 , 9 ) .",
    "that also simultaneously explains hole doping effect .",
    "as@xmath0 and ( d , e , f ) ca@xmath21sn@xmath22fe@xmath0as@xmath0 systems around @xmath24 ( 1st row ) , x ( 2nd row ) and y ( 3rd row ) points .",
    "modification in the band widths of electron ( reduction in band width ) and hole ( increment in band width ) like bands causes apprehendable modifications in the fss ( see fig.[fs - vca - ca]).,width=302,height=415 ]    thus , sn impurity causes splitting between the d@xmath1 and the pair of nearly degenerate bands d@xmath25/d@xmath26 .",
    "the modulations of the d@xmath25/d@xmath26 bands can also produce modulations in the d@xmath1 bands .",
    "but the d@xmath1 band around the @xmath24 point is much lower in energy compared to that of the d@xmath25/d@xmath26 bands and closer to the fl for the undoped ba122 .",
    "this is not the case of undoped sr122 , ca122 where d@xmath1/d@xmath25/d@xmath26 are nearly at same but higher in energy .",
    "the effect of modulations in the d@xmath1 bands due to that of the d@xmath25/d@xmath26 bands is thus minimum in case of sr-122 , ca-122 systems .",
    "the consequence of sn impurity on 122 family materials thus depend on strong doping sensitivity of the underlying system  energy levels of d@xmath1/d@xmath25/d@xmath26 and the impurity energy level .",
    "the d@xmath1 band of ba122 being already very close to the fl in presence of sn impurity is pushed down below the fl due to such modulation , causing the lifshitz transition .",
    "we have studied the effect of sn impurity on the electronic structures of 122 systems ( bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) using vca method for introducing sn impurity into the 122 crystal structures .",
    "presence of sn impurity modifies the electronic structures of ba122 system remarkably , which in turn is expected to result certain changes in the physical properties like reduction of structural and magnetic transition temperatures as well as superconducting transition temperature . on the contrary , sn impurity does not have much impact on the electronic structures of sr122 and ca122 systems as reflected in the experimental evidence of robustness of structural , magnetic and superconducting transition temperatures @xcite . in ba122 system , we observe sn impurity induced lifshitz transition around @xmath24 point that dictates several changes in the electronic structures near fermi level including degradation of fs nesting contrasting the case of sr122 and ca122 systems .",
    "orbital ordering between d@xmath26 and d@xmath25 bands around x and y points , which is responsible for structural transition , remains unaltered in case of sr122 and ca122 systems but is substantially modified in case of ba122 system in presence of sn impurity .",
    "this work thus not only provide a detailed description of electronic structures of sn contaminated 122 systems but also provides a possible explanation to the various observed anomalies in the physical properties that are not well understood so far .",
