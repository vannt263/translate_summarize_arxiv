    "the @xmath3 coset cft and its relation with three - dimensional higher - spin vasiliev theory @xcite is a well - tested example of the ads - cft correspondence .",

    "however , a cft often possesses a number of modular invariants .",
    "these come with varying spectra and one can , therefore , expect that their bulk duals should also be different .",
    "this is borne out by the few examples , that exist in the literature , of a duality between a non - diagonal cft invariant and a higher - spin bulk theory  @xcite .",
    "however , so far , there has been no systematic attempt to understand where different non - diagonal invariants of coset cfts fit in the duality picture .",
    "we propose to address this question in this paper and ref .",
    "@xcite .    for any coset cft , it is a hard problem to classify all modular - invariant partition functions @xcite .",
    "modular invariants of a coset cft are intimately related to modular invariants of wzw models .",
    "coset cfts are of the form @xmath6 where the group @xmath7 is embedded in @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 the levels of the affine groups @xmath8 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the character of this coset model , also known as the branching function , is the coefficient of the expansion of the character of the affine group @xmath11 into the characters of the affine group @xmath12 : [ branchdef ] c^g _ = _ b _ c^h_. here , @xmath13 , the branching function of the coset cft , is a function of the modular parameter @xmath14 and carries an index @xmath15 labelling the primary fields of the @xmath11 wzw model and an index @xmath16 labelling the primaries of the @xmath12 wzw model .",
    "the problem of classifying modular invariants of a coset cft is , therefore , a problem of classifying the modular invariants of wzw models .",
    "however , although a complete classification of the modular invariants of wzw models remains elusive , it is easy to identify distinct classes of modular invariants .",
    "all wzw models have a diagonal invariant of the form _",
    "|_|^2 , referred to in the literature as an `` @xmath17''-type invariant .",
    "there is an important class of invariants called `` @xmath18''-type invariants that can be constructed from the diagonal partition function by modding out by a discrete symmetry of the wzw model .",
    "we discuss them in more detail in ref .",
    "the third class consists of exceptional invariants or `` @xmath19''-type , constructed using a variety of methods .",
    "this class of invariants is the one that is difficult to classify .",
    "however , there is a sub - class of @xmath19-type invariants that have a straightforward origin .",
    "these are the @xmath19-type invariants that result from conformal embeddings .",

    "some conformal embeddings only appear for specific values of the ranks of the groups @xmath8 and @xmath7 , however , others appear for generic values of the rank and specific values of the levels in terms of the rank .",
    "we are interested in the second class of embeddings because they result in infinite series of partition functions . getting a series of invariants",
    "is particularly useful from the point of view of the bulk dual because it allows one to take a t hooft limit .",
    "however , since a conformal embedding always fixes the value of the level @xmath22 in terms of the rank @xmath23 of the gauge group @xmath7 , the t hooft coupling given by @xmath24 is fixed at a particular value . in all examples that we look at in this paper @xmath25",
