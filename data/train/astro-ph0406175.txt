    "one of the most important discoveries by iras was the detection of a class of galaxies with infrared ( 81000@xmath0 m ) luminosities in excess of 10@xmath14l@xmath15 and infrared - to - blue ratios ( l@xmath16/l@xmath17 ) even higher than for lower luminosity infared - bright galaxies .",
    "numerous studies have since established that ulirgs are predominantly found in interacting systems and that their huge luminosities are the result of vigorous , merger - induced star formation and/or agn activity .",
    "spectacular as they may be , ulirgs are relatively rare in the local universe @xcite . at higher redshifts though",
    ", ulirgs play an important role in the measurable star formation density and may account for most of the far - infrared ( fir ) background @xcite .",
    "as such , the study of local members of the ulirg community may be instrumental in understanding their high redshift counterparts .",
    "irasf001837111 is a distant ( @xmath18=0.327 ; d@xmath19=1700mpc , assuming h@xmath20=71kms@xmath21mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22=0.27 , @xmath23=0.73 , @xmath24=0 ) , luminous ( l@xmath16=7@xmath251@xmath2610@xmath14l@xmath15 ) ulirg , discovered by iras .",
    "the galaxy has been optically classified as liner / seyfert@xmath31.5 by @xcite .",
    "its radio luminosity is in the range of powerful radio galaxies , far higher than would be expected for starburst galaxies on the basis of the fir luminosity ( q=1.14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "k - band imaging shows the galaxy to have a disturbed morphology @xcite .",
    "iso mid - infrared ( mir ) spectroscopy revealed its 512@xmath0 m spectrum to be markedly different from that of template starbursts and agns , showing instead more similarities to deeply obscured galactic sources @xcite .",
    "based on the absorbed spectral appearance , @xcite conclude that irasf001837111 is an extremely obscured agn .",
    "the 512@xmath0 m spectral appearance of irasf001837111 is not unique . in a study involving 103 galaxies observed spectroscopically by iso @xcite , irasf001837111 is classified along with iras001880856 , ngc4418 and iras15250 + 3609 as a class i ` ice galaxy ' ; showing ice , silicate and hydrocarbon absorption features , with little or no sign of pah emission bands . based on this classification ,",
    "@xcite conclude that the power source in irasf001837111 may be in the obscured beginnings of star formation or agn activity .",
    "in this letter we report a new spectrum obtained at a spectral resolution of 64128 , extending the observed range from 512@xmath0 m to 427@xmath0 m .",
    "a low resolution 538@xmath0 m spectrum of irasf001837111 was obtained on november 14 , 2003 using the irs spectrometer @xcite onboard the spitzer space telescope @xcite . the observation ( aor key 7556352 )",
    "was performed using 60sec .",
    "ramps in both short - low order 2 ( sl2 ; 5.27.7@xmath0 m ) and order 1 ( sl1 ; 7.414.5@xmath0 m ) , while using 31sec .",
    "ramps in both long - low order 2 ( ll2 ; 14.021.3@xmath0 m ) and order 1 ( ll1 ; 19.538.0@xmath0 m ) , with a total integration time amounting to 15minutes .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the irs pipeline ( v9.1 ) at the spitzer science center .",
    "background emission in our aperture was removed from the sl and ll images by differencing the two nod positions .",
    "the spectrum of both the target and the calibration star ( hd105 for sl and hr6348 for ll ) were extracted with an aperture which scales with wavelength .",
    "the target spectrum was flux calibrated by dividing it by the stellar spectrum , followed by multiplication by the adopted cohen stellar model @xcite .",
    "finally , the long - low section was defringed using the ` irs defringer ' . for a good match to both ll1 and sl1 ,",
    "the ll2 spectrum was divided by 1.1 .",
    "we estimate the absolute flux calibration of the resulting spectrum to have a tolerance of less than 20% .",
    "the irs spectrum of irasf001837111 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) is dominated by broad and partially overlapping absorption features , spanning the entire observable range .",
    "emission features have been detected only in the 9.513@xmath0 m range .",
    "optical depth profiles and the derived physical properties generally depend strongly on the assumed local continuum . here",
    "we will adopt the spline - interpolated continuum as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "although a small contribution of 7.7@xmath0 m pah emission to the 7.7@xmath0 m flux is to be expected , the non - detection of the 6.2@xmath0 m pah band ( sect.3.3 ) indicates that this contribution is small ( @xmath125% ) .",
    "we therefore do not correct the 7.7@xmath0 m local continuum for this emission . at 13.5@xmath0",
    "m we choose to run the local continuum a factor exp[@xmath27(13.5@xmath0 m ) ] above the 13.5@xmath0 m flux to correct for the non - zero optical depth in the overlap region between the 9.7 and 18@xmath0 m silicate absorption bands ( see sect.3.2 ) . beyond 13.5@xmath0 m ,",
    "the local continuum is purely hypothetical , designed only to give a reasonable fit to the 18@xmath0 m silicate feature .",
    "table[tab1 ] gives an overview of the absorption features detected in the spectrum of irasf001837111 ; the associated optical depth profiles are presented in fig.[fig2 ] . in our analysis of the absorption features",
    ", we have used the spectra of extinguished galactic lines of sight ( the galactic center sources gcs3i and sgra@xmath28 and the embedded massive protostar w33a ) , as well as one extragalactic line of sight ( the nucleus of ngc4418 ) for comparison .    the broad double branched feature",
    "centered at 4.67@xmath0 m is identified with the p and r branches of the fundamental vibration mode of co gas . using the isothermal plane parallel lte gas models of @xcite , a best fit to the observed profile",
    "is found for a model with a gas temperature of 720k , an intrinsic linewidth of 50km / s and a column density of 10@xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "the derived temperature is far higher than found towards galactic ism lines of sight , consistent with the clearly larger width of the feature .",
    "a comparison of the model to the data is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "for galactic sources , a narrow absorption band at 4.26@xmath0 m is normally attributed to co@xmath1 ice . however , despite extensive comparison to galactic ice sources , neither the peak position ( 4.273@xmath0 m ) nor the red wing of the feature in irasf001837111 is found to be consistent with solid state co@xmath1 . using our gas models ,",
    "a reasonable fit is obtained for gas phase co@xmath1 at a temperature @xmath29110k .",
    "another broad absorption complex extends from 5.7 to almost 7.8@xmath0 m , with peaks at 6.15 , 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 m .",
    "the peak positions and profiles appear very similar to those found for sgra@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the blue wing ( 5.75.9@xmath0 m ) also matches the profile observed towards w33a @xcite . beyond 6.0@xmath0 m ,",
    "the profiles of irasf001837111 and sgra@xmath28 are markedly different from that of w33a , peaking at 6.156.20@xmath0 m instead of 6.0@xmath0 m . while the w33a profile is consistent with the profile of water ice , the shift in peak position for irasf001837111 and sgra@xmath28 indicates the presence of strong additional absorption , likely due to hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "the two absorption bands at 6.85 and 7.25@xmath0 m are identified with the c ",
    "h stretching mode of hydrocarbons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the only other two sources for which these bands have been detected are sgra@xmath28 @xcite and the nucleus of ngc4418 @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , the features compare well with those seen in a laboratory spectrum of hydrogenated amorphous carbons ( hac ) @xcite .    beyond 8@xmath0 m ,",
    "the irasf001837111 spectrum shows two characteristic broad absorption bands due to silicates .",
    "to estimate the optical depth in both features , we use a baseline - subtracted silicate absorption profile of gcs3i @xcite . assuming the contribution of starburst - related emission to be negligible , a best fit to the blue wing of the 9.7@xmath0 m feature is obtained for an optical depth of @xmath55 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this fit also gives reasonable result for the red wing , but fails to fit the center of the feature .",
    "as will be discussed in sect.3.3 , the latter is an indication for the presence of a separate , extended , low intensity , relatively unobscured emission component , filling in the bottom of the feature .",
    "the derived optical depth turns into a lower limit if the contribution from starburst emission is higher than assumed .",
    "note that the fit to the 9.7@xmath0 m feature overpredicts the depth of the 18@xmath0 m band by more than a factor of 3 .",
    "this either points to the presence of a strong starburst continuum filling in the 18@xmath0 m silicate feature , or to the effects of radiative transfer in warm silicates . in either this case",
    "the true silicate optical depth may be far higher than inferred from our fit .",

    "interestingly , their presence in the center and red flank of the optically thick 9.7@xmath0 m silicate band suggests a common origin away from the absorbing medium .",
    "also the weak continuum , filling in the silicate feature , may be associated with these emission features .",
    "we list the measured line strengths as well as upper limits for lines commonly detected in star formation environments in table[tab2 ] .    given the clear detection of the 11.2@xmath0 m pah band , the non - detection of the 6.2@xmath0 m pah band may seem surprising .",
    "however , as @xcite have shown for galactic ism lines of sight , the ratio 6.2pah/11.2pah is variable and ranges from 1 to 3 for hii regions . at a value of @xmath120.83 ,",
    "the ratio for irasf001837111 is outside the range for galactic hii regions , but still above the values found for the galaxies ngc5195 ( 0.57 ; * ? ? ? * ) and ngc3226 ( 0.35 ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , in another study of hii regions , @xcite find that sources with 6.2pah/11.2pah@xmath121 all happen to be low metallicity objects ( e.g. smcb1#1 and positions in 30dor ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the ir flux associated with the star formation component can be made using conversion factors l(11.2pah)/l(ir)=0.0014 and l(6.2pah)/l(ir)=0.0034 , as proposed by @xcite for m82 and @xcite for normal and starburst galaxies , respectively .",
    "the resulting contribution from the unobscured star formation component to the ir luminosity budget of irasf001837111 hence may range from @xmath2910% ( based on the 6.2@xmath0 m pah upper limit ) to 30% ( based on the 11.2@xmath0 m pah flux ) .    finally , we investigated the nature of the [ neii ] flux by comparing it to the measured 11.2@xmath0 m pah flux and the [ neii]/11.2pah ratio for a sample of ( compact ) hii regions @xcite .",
    "we find that the observed ratio for iras001837111 ( 0.6 ) compares well to the galactic values .",

    "we have compared the wealth of emission and absorption features in the exotic mir spectrum of irasf001837111 to ( extra)galactic lines of sight displaying similar features .",
    "the picture that emerges is that of an energetically dominant nuclear power source , buried deeply behind two obscuring shells .",
    "the inner shell consists of warm gas ( t@xmath5720k ; n@xmath10=10@xmath11@xmath9 ; table[tab1 ] ) , giving rise to absorption bands of warm co gas and hydrocarbons against an otherwise featureless hot mir continuum .",
    "this absorbing gas has to be dense ( n@xmath423@xmath2610@xmath6@xmath7 ) as well in order to give rise to high - j level absorption , which limits the size of the absorbing region to @xmath120.03pc .",
    "the high temperature and density as well as the small scale size locates this absorbing gas to close to the power source of this region .",
    "the outer shell is far colder and is responsible for the absorption features of co@xmath1 ice / gas , water ice and silicates . given the depth of the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate band ( @xmath43@xmath35 ) , the column density of the outer shell amounts to at least n@xmath10=10@xmath44@xmath9 ( table[tab1 ] ) .",
    "the emission lines from molecular hydrogen , pahs and ne@xmath13 , as well as the weak continuum filling in the 9.7@xmath0 m silicate feature , likely originate outside this shell structure . based on the strength of the 11.2@xmath0 m pah feature , this star formation component may be responsible for up to 30% of the ir luminosity of the system .",
    "optical and radio observations indicate that the power source hiding in the nucleus is most likely an agn .",
    "the optical evidence comes from an emission line study of @xcite , who classify irasf001837111 as a liner / seyfert@xmath31.5 . convincing evidence is also presented by @xcite , who show that the radio power of irasf001837111 is far higher than expected on the basis of the radio - fir correleation for starburst galaxies .",
    "radio vlbi observations further indicate the nucleus to be unresolved on the 0.025@xmath45 ( 200pc ) scale ( r.p.norris , priv . comm . ) .",
    "our irs data is in agreement with these findings . in a diagram of l(6.2pah)/l(fir ) versus l(6.2cont)/l(fir ) , the so - called ` mir - fir diagram ' @xcite , irasf001837111 is found at a position intermediate between a deeply obscured source ( e.g. ngc4418 ) and agns with a clear line of sight to their agn - heated hot dust ( e.g. ngc1068 ) .",
    "the latter can also be infered from fig.[fig3 ] , where the ir spectrum of irasf001837111 shows signatures of both an agn - like hot dust continuum ( ngc1068 ; * ? ? ? * ) and a deeply obscured source ( ngc4418 ; * ? ? ?",
