    "muon decay , a pure leptonic electroweak process , serves a special role in the standard model ( sm ) because it calibrates the strength of the weak coupling .",
    "its precise theoretical description , via the so - called michel parameters@xcite , positions it uniquely to provide constraints on possible contributions outside the @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  standard electroweak model .",
    "below we discuss new results on the radiative muon decay @xmath12 , or rmd , the only process that gives access to the decay parameter @xmath13 .",
    "pion decays constrain the sm in different ways , ever since providing early evidence for the @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  nature of the weak interaction through the @xmath14@xmath15 helicity suppression of direct @xmath16 decay compared to the @xmath17 sequence .",
    "in recent decades the theoretical treatment of pion decays has reached unprecedented levels of precision . of particular interest",
    "are the @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5  decay channels .",
    "+ * ( a ) @xmath18 decay ( @xmath1 ) *    a series of calculations have refined the sm description to a precision better than a part in @xmath19 : @xmath20     \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 indicates that radiative decays are included .",
    "meanwhile , experimental precision lags behind the theoretical one by almost two orders of magnitude : @xmath22@xcite because of the large helicity suppression of the @xmath1  decay , its branching ratio is highly susceptible to small non-@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11   contributions from new physics , making this decay a particularly suitable subject of study , as discussed in , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "this prospect provides the primary motivation for the ongoing pen@xcite and pienu@xcite experiments . of the possible `` new physics '' contributions in the lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath1  is directly sensitive to the pseudoscalar one . at the precision of @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 probes the pseudoscalar and axial mass scales up to 1,000tev and 20tev , respectively@xcite . for comparison",
    ", ckm unitarity and precise measurements of several superallowed nuclear beta decays constrain the non - sm vector contributions to 20tev , and scalar to 10tev @xcite .",
    "although scalar interactions do not directly contribute to @xmath24 , they can do so through loop effects , resulting in sensitivity to new scalar interactions up to 60tev @xcite .",
    "the subject was recently reviewed in ref .  .",
    "alternatively , @xmath25 provides limits on masses of certain susy partners@xcite , and on neutrino sector anomalies@xcite . + * ( b ) radiative @xmath26 decay ( @xmath3 ) *    thanks to the radiated photon , the @xmath3  decay provides information on the structure of the pion .",
    "two sets of amplitudes contribute to rpd : the inner - bremsstrahlung , ib , fully described by qed , and the structure - dependent , sd .",
    "standard @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11  electroweak theory requires only two pion form factors , @xmath27 , axial vector , and @xmath28 , vector , to describe the sd amplitude ; the cvc hypothesis fixes @xmath29 . in a series of measurements at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) , the pibeta project , discussed below ,",
    "has improved the experimental precision of the @xmath3  differential branching ratio as well as @xmath27 and @xmath28 by over an order of magnitude , and set new limits on the putative tensor term , @xmath30.@xcite .",
    "+ * ( c ) pion beta decay : @xmath31 ( @xmath5 ) *    the extremely rare , @xmath32 , pure vector @xmath33 pion beta decay is the theoretically cleanest process to measure the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix element @xmath34 and test quark - lepton universality .",
    "the pibeta project has improved the experimental precision of the branching ratio by an order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "this result represents the most stringent test of cvc and cabibbo universality in a meson .",
    "the urgency of a further improvement was considerably reduced by the bnl e865 result@xcite and the subsequent renormalization of @xmath35 that removed a longstanding @xmath36 shortfall in ckm matrix unitarity .",
    "the pen@xcite and its predecessor pibeta@xcite experiments were designed to optimize the detection of pion and muon decays at rest .",
    "the apparatus , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsect ] ,    comprises an active target with beam tracking , two concentric cylindrical multiwire proportional chambers , a thin 20-element hodoscope , and a @xmath37sr electromagnetic calorimeter made of pure csi .",
    "the apparatus and its performance are described in detail in ref .  .",
    "pibeta focused on the @xmath5 , @xmath3  and rmd decays in four long runs between 1999 and 2004 .",
    "pen , which started in 2007 and has conducted its main data runs in 200810 , is focused on @xmath1 , but will produce important updates to the pibeta @xmath3  and rmd results .",
    "key to both experiments is the simultaneous precise treatment of all of these decay processes , along with the dominant @xmath38 chain , as each presents significant backgrounds to the others .",
    "we have recently analyzed a set of @xmath140.5 m rmd events ; the relevant measured and monte carlo simulated spectra , including backgrounds , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmd ] , showing excellent    agreement within the design acceptance of the spectrometer .",
    "the analysis yields a preliminary branching ratio for @xmath40mev , and @xmath41 : @xmath42 which represents a 29-fold improvement in precision over the previous result , and is in excellent agreement with the sm value : @xmath43 .",
    "minimum-@xmath44 analysis of the most sensitive data subset ( with roughly balanced systematic and statistical uncertainties ) yields a preliminary value for the @xmath13 parameter ( @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 a 4-fold improvement over previous limits.@xcite details of this analysis , including a comprehensive discussion of the uncertainties , are given in refs .   and .",
    "during the 2008 - 10 production runs the pen experiment accumulated some 23 m @xmath18 , and @xmath47 m @xmath17 events , as well as significant numbers of pion and muon radiative decays .",
    "a comprehensive blinded maximum likelihood analysis is under way to extract a new experimental value of @xmath48 .",
    "the pen goal is @xmath49 .",
    "the competing pienu experiment at triumf has a similar precision goal .",
    "the near to medium future will thus bring about a substantial improvement in the limits on @xmath50-@xmath51 lepton universality , and the attendant sm limits .",
    "once completed , analysis of the pen @xmath3  data is expected to yield improvements in the sd@xmath52 structure dependent amplitude , which constrains @xmath53 , thus improving on the pibeta result for @xmath28@xcite . in a similar vein ,",
    "analysis of the pen @xmath54 data is expected to improve the present value of the michel parameter @xmath13 , leading to a new global analysis of the fundamental weak couplings .",
