    "this has been recently experimentally realized ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) for the case of two entangled optical modes at the output of a parametric oscillator .",
    "instead , one does not have direct access to the vibrational modes and therefore it is not clear how to measure them . however ref .",
    "@xcite showed that , apart from additional detection shot noise , the motional state of the mirror can be read from the output of an adjacent fabry - perot cavity , formed by the mirror to be detected and another `` fixed '' ( i.e. with large mass ) mirror .",
    "in fact , it is possible to adjust the parameters of this second cavity so that both position and momentum of the mirror can be experimentally determined by homodyning the cavity output light @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the readout cavity is driven by a much weaker laser so that its back - action on the mechanical mode can be neglected , its detuning @xmath201 is chosen to be equal to the mechanical frequency @xmath202 , and its bandwidth @xmath203 is large enough so that the cavity mode adiabatically follows the mirror dynamics , the output of the readout cavity @xmath204 is given by @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the annihilation operator of the vibrational mode , @xmath207 is the effective optomechanical coupling of the readout cavity ( see eq .",
    "( [ optoc ] ) ) , and @xmath208 is the input noise entering the readout cavity . therefore using a readout cavity for each mirror , changing the phases of the two local oscillators and measuring the correlations between the two readout cavity output one can then detect all the entries of the correlation matrix @xmath92 and from them numerically extract the logarithmic negativity @xmath146 by means of eqs .",
    "( [ logneg ] ) and ( [ sympl_eigenv ] ) .",
    "we have considered a system formed by a linear cavity with two vibrating mirrors , driven by an intense classical light field .",
    "the two mirror vibrational modes interact thanks to the radiation pressure of the light bouncing between them .",
    "we have determined the steady state of the system and we have seen that , in the case of identical mechanical oscillators , the two vibrational modes become entangled if the cavity detuning is close to the mechanical frequency .",
    "the resulting mechanical entanglement is however quite fragile with respect to temperature and this suggests that , in order to generate macroscopic mechanical entanglement which is more robust with respect to thermal effects , it is convenient to drive the cavity with nonclassical light ( see e.g. , @xcite . )",
