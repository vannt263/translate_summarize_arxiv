    "the change in the behavior of atoms when the structure of the `` surrounding '' field differs from that of free space is treated so far in innumerable works and is essentially the basic topic of cavity qed @xcite .",
    "effects like modified decay rates of atoms in cavities were visible in various measurements @xcite . in this case , the atoms couple irreversibly to a large number of field modes and the problem can be treated within the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "this regime is therefore known as `` low - q '' or perturbative cavity qed @xcite .",
    "another area of high importance is its counterpart , the physics of `` high - q '' cavities , where the atoms interact strongly only with one ( or few ) field mode(s ) . in this context ,",
    "recent experiments include , e.g. , the observation of atom trajectories in cavities storing merely one photon @xcite .",
    "furthermore , among other things , effects caused by the spatial structure of a field mode in a cavity were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "high - q cavities serve also as a testing ground for fundamental quantum mechanical effects like entanglement or decoherence @xcite .    besides some considerations on the spontaneous decay of an excited two - level atom we will mainly focus in this paper on the problem of resonance fluorescence in a half - cavity , i.e.  a cavity with one mirror , where we pay special attention to the position dependence of the atomic dynamics . to this end",
    "we will particularly consider a physical system which essentially coincides with the setup of an recently performed experiment @xcite . here",
    ", the radiation which is emitted by a laser cooled ion stored in paul trap is partly collimated by a lens and reflected back by a mirror to the atom .",
    "the intensity of the scattered light was measured as a function of the mirror position leading to an oscillatory behavior of the photon counting rate , proving the existence of inhibited and enhanced spontaneous emission effects . in this case , where the atom is relatively close to the mirror , the observed effects can in principal explained by introducing some effective modified ( position dependent ) spontaneous emission rates and level shifts .",
    "this could be done since the time the light needs to bounce back and forth between the atom and the mirror could be set essentially to zero ( markovian limit ) .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the distance between the atom and the mirror is large .    in this paper",
    "we will , among other things , particularly consider this case and it turns out that the dynamics of the atom can be described generally in terms of non - markovian ( delay - differential ) equations . as we will see , the distance between the atom and the mirror influences the atomic behavior essentially on two scales : on the one hand , on a large scale , i.e.  whether the atom is located far away from the mirror or very close to the mirror . this scale can be measured essentially by a dimensionless quantity @xmath0 where @xmath1 is given by the width of the field spectrum ( in case of vanishing laser intensity it is simply the atomic spontaneous emission rate ) and the time @xmath2 the light needs for a round trip between atom and mirror . on the other hand ,",
    "the atomic behavior varies also if the distance is changed on the scale of an optical wavelength given by @xmath3 .",
    "for example in case of a small atom - mirror distance ( @xmath4 ) the equations of motions become approximately markovian and the well - known phenomenon of enhanced or inhibited spontaneous emission ( depending on @xmath3 ) , can be recovered .",
    "thus , it is possible to describe the system by introducing effective spontaneous emission rates and level shifts . in general",
    ", however , the retardation of the time argument in the equations of motion can not be neglected .",
    "we will not consider in this paper effects arising in the case of extremely small distances , i.e.  of the order of wavelengths or smaller , between the atom and the mirror @xcite .    in connection with cavity qed , in the broadest sense ,",
    "the above mentioned delay - differential equations appeared already in some works .",
    "these include for example the analytical treatments of milonni _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in which a single excited quantum system coupled to an infinite set of equally spaced discrete levels was considered , a system which reminds of an atom in a cavity but without taking into account some position depending effects .",
    "the latter problem was discussed in the framework of a one - dimensional model by cook and milonni @xcite in case of an excited atom in front of a partially reflecting wall ( modeled as a collection of two - level atoms ) and in a fabry - perot resonator .",
    "this treatment is closely related to our discussion of pure spontaneous decay since we will recover the same equation of motion .",
    "another treatment of this problem was given by feng and ujihara @xcite by using an appropriate set of mode functions in order to account for non - perfect mirror reflectivities .",
    "dung and ujihara @xcite finally examined an atom in a three - dimensional fabry - perot resonator .",
    "although a delay differential equation was not explicitly formulated , retardation effects in the interaction of two atoms were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "a partly numerical examination of an atom inside a spherical cavity was given by parker and stroud @xcite .",
    "numerical examinations include furthermore the work of gieen _ _ et al.__@xcite and buek _ et al . _",
    "@xcite both treating an atom in a ( one - dimensional ) cavity whereas the latter also investigates the presence of material media .",
    "the mentioned works have in common that recurrences of the atomic population take place for large dimensions of the cavity which is due to one - photon wave packets bouncing back and forth between the cavity walls . however , there is always only one excitation contained in the system making the problem accessible for analytical considerations .    in case of a ( near-)resonantly driven atom the dynamics of the system is more complicated since the number of excitations increase continuously",
    ". the scattered radiation will be reflected by the mirror and re - interact with its own source , the atom .",
    "this situation reminds us of a feedback problem @xcite where mostly the assumption of a negligible feedback time delay is made .",
    "however , the situation of large atom - mirror distances would correspond to a non - markovian feedback @xcite .",
    "this article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] we will reconsider the problem of pure spontaneous decay of an excited atom in the presence of a mirror while in sec .  [",
    "sec : sec3 ] a continuous laser excitation of the atom is incorporated to our examination .",
    "we will discuss several limits including low and higher laser intensities and small distances between the atom and the mirror .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] and cumbersome formulas and calculations are moved to appendices .",
    "in this section we will investigate the spontaneous emission of an atom at rest in the presence of a mirror initially prepared in the excited state .",
    "we will derive a non - markovian equation of motion for this system .",
    "although this derivation is related to the calculations in @xcite it will be discussed here , not only to introduce our notation but also to present new , entirely analytical results , also with respect to spectral properties of the emitted light .",
    "furthermore it will turn out that some calculation methods can be transfered and some features of this system are recovered when we include laser excitation in our considerations .",
    "as already mentioned we examine an initially excited two - level atom with transition frequency @xmath5 in the presence of a finite size mirror where the light emitted in a certain solid angle fraction @xmath6 is reflected back to the atom .",
    "this is achieved by a lens which collimates the radiation before it is reflected @xcite .",
    "the remaining emission is not affected by the mirror .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to consider the coupling of the atom to two reservoirs ( or `` channels '' ) consisting of one - dimensional fields with standing wave field modes and running wave field modes , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , i.e.  the hamiltonian in rotating wave approximation reads @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to a cavity , here , the mode density of the mirror channel is continuous since only one boundary condition has to be fulfilled .",
    "the operators @xmath10 are the usual raising and lowering operators of a two - level system with upper level @xmath11 and ground state @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are creation and annihilation operators of a photon in the @xmath16th mode of the different environments .",
    "the dipole matrix element @xmath17 is assumed to be real and for the sake of simplicity we suppress the vectorial character of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the exact form of the factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 is of no importance here , we merely assume that they are approximately constant in a frequency range of relevance ( usually they have a frequency dependence @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) . in order to investigate the dynamics of the system we make the wigner - weisskopf type ansatz @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the vacuum state of the radiation field and @xmath25 the state with exactly one photon in mode @xmath16 .",
    "we will consider here an initially excited atom in the absence of any photon , i.e.  @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "by formally integrating the latter two equations and inserting them into the first one we get @xmath33{\\text{e}}^{-{\\text{i}}\\omega_0(t'-t)}. \\label{eq : ww_approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we introduced the free space spontaneous decay rate @xmath34 which is split up into a part @xmath35 and @xmath36 , corresponding to the coupling of the atom to the first and second channel .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 is the solid angle fraction which is covered by the lens since it characterizes the fraction of radiation which is reflected . in the above equations we also introduced the time @xmath37 the light needs for the distance atom - mirror - atom .",
    "furthermore , in the first step of ( [ eq : ww_approx ] ) , a wigner - weisskopf type approximation was made based on the well - known fact that the relative variation of @xmath38(@xmath39 ) is very slow in the domain where the double integration in the first line of ( [ eq : ww_approx ] ) lead to appreciable values .",
    "diverging terms connected with level shifts are omitted .",
    "it should be stressed here that in this paper only distances between the atom and the mirror are considered which are much larger than an optical wavelength , i.e.  @xmath40 which is in an optical frequency domain already the case for , say , a millimeter .",
    "( [ eq : ww_approx ] ) yields finally the delay differential equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of this equation corresponds to the usual free space exponential decay while the second term represents the effect of the reflected radiation on the atom which was emitted at time @xmath2 _ before _ it interacts again with the atom .",
    "thus , the retarded argument of the excited state amplitude directly indicates the memory effects which are inherent in the system .",
    "furthermore , the second term is weighted with the factor @xmath6 revealing that only a fraction of the emitted light is reflected .",

    "$ ] the sum consists only of one term , @xmath45 , which coincides with the free space behavior of a decaying atom .",
    "the physical reason for that is that the atom requires at least the time the light needs to get from the atom to the mirror and back to the atom again in order to `` see '' the mirror . for @xmath46",

    "the role of the interference terms in the excited state probabilities strongly depends on the distance between the atom and the mirror which can be measured by the quantity @xmath48 . if we consider again the second time interval it is easy to see that that the interference term is of order @xmath48 while a further term is of order @xmath49 which can be neglected for @xmath50 ( small distance ) .",

    "would be the inclusion of the motional degrees of freedom of the atom .",
