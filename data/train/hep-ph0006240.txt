    "in the limit of isospin symmetry , the decay of a kaon , with isospin @xmath10 , into two pions , with isospin @xmath11 or @xmath12 , is mediated by either @xmath9 or @xmath8 weak transitions .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0 branching ratios in this limit indicates that the @xmath9 amplitude exceeds the @xmath8 amplitude by a factor of roughly twenty .",
    "a detailed understanding of this large enhancement , termed the `` @xmath9 rule , '' has proven elusive , although recently the subject has received much attention  @xcite . however , another , potentially related , puzzle remains .",
    "unitarity and cpt invariance , in concert with isospin symmetry , predicts that the strong phase difference between the @xmath12 and @xmath11 amplitudes in @xmath0 decay should equal that of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 amplitudes in @xmath13-wave @xmath14 scattering .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath0 branching ratios , using isospin - symmetric amplitudes but physical phase space , indicates , however , that this is not the case . specifically , the strong phase difference inferred from @xmath0 decays is @xmath15  @xcite , whereas that from @xmath13-wave , @xmath14 scattering at the kaon mass is @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "it is our purpose to examine how isospin - violating effects impact this apparent discrepancy .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks differ both in their charges and masses , so that the symmetry of the @xmath0 decay amplitudes under @xmath17 and @xmath18 quark exchange is merely approximate . in specific , if we continue to use the labels `` @xmath11 '' and `` @xmath12 '' to denote the combinations of @xmath0 amplitudes which correspond to @xmath14 final states of definite isospin in the isospin - perfect limit , then in this basis , the weak transitions are of @xmath9 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 in character . the violation of isospin symmetry thus generates an additional amplitude with @xmath1 .",
    "such effects can modify the @xmath9 and @xmath8 amplitudes as well , though the large empirical enhancement of the @xmath9 amplitude relative to the @xmath8 amplitude found in the isospin - conserving analysis suggests that isospin - violating contributions built on the former are of greater phenomenological significance .",
    "indeed , it has long been suspected that isospin - breaking effects contaminate the extracted ratio of @xmath8 to @xmath9 amplitudes in a non - trivial way , precisely as isospin violation in the `` large '' @xmath9 amplitude generates a contribution of @xmath8 in character  and as the scale of strong interaction isospin violation , @xmath21 , is crudely commensurate with that of the ratio determined in an isospin - perfect analysis . indeed , including @xmath22 effects in a leading - order chiral",
    "analysis makes the `` true '' ratio of @xmath8 to @xmath9 amplitudes some 30% smaller  @xcite .",
    "we extract the @xmath9 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 amplitudes from the empirical @xmath0 branching ratios and then proceed to examine what solutions for the `` true '' @xmath9 and @xmath19 amplitudes may emerge .",
    "interestingly , these considerations impact the standard model ( sm ) estimate of as well , for in standard practice the empirical value of the ratio of the real parts of the @xmath8 to @xmath9 amplitudes is used , in concert with a `` short - distance '' determination of the amplitudes imaginary parts , to determine in the sm  @xcite .",
    "isospin violation plays an important role in the analysis of @xmath23 , for it modifies the cancellation of the imaginary to real part ratios in the @xmath9 and @xmath8 @xmath24 amplitudes in a significant manner  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath7 , the ratio of the real parts of the @xmath8 to @xmath9 amplitudes , used , however , emerges from an analysis of @xmath24 branching ratios  @xcite , under the assumption that isospin symmetry is perfect .",
    "thus we also explore the connection between isospin violation in and isospin violation in the @xmath0 branching ratios .",
    "we determine that the standard practice suffices to leading order in isospin violation if @xmath1 transitions can be neglected .",
    "the @xmath1 transitions enter differently in charged kaon and neutral kaon decays , and as the value of @xmath7 incorporated is derived , in part , from the @xmath25 branching ratio , the value of @xmath7 must be adjusted for @xmath1 effects in order to estimate .",
    "this decreases the value of and adds to its uncertainty as well .",
    "we begin by considering the constraints that unitarity and time - reversal invariance place on the parametrization of the @xmath0 amplitudes in the presence of strong - interaction isospin violation .",
    "we consider exclusively @xmath26 effects as electromagnetic effects are considered in ref .  @xcite . with an appropriate parametrization in place",
    ", we consider the phenomenological analysis of the @xmath0 branching ratios , extracting the amplitudes associated with the possible weak transitions and comparing these results with a chiral analysis .",
    "we then turn to and consider how isospin - violating effects in the branching ratios are related to those in .",
    "we seek to determine what constraints may be brought to bear on the parametrization of the @xmath0 amplitudes in the presence of isospin violation . to this end enters watson s theorem .",
    "we note that in the isospin - perfect limit , unitarity , and cpt invariance yields  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the effective weak hamiltonian for kaon decays .",

    "( [ watson ] ) .",
    "the most significant of the modes with photons or leptons in the final state is @xmath60 ; let us continue to neglect such electromagnetic isospin - violating effects and investigate the effects of strong - interaction isospin violation .",
    "we also neglect the 3@xmath49 intermediate state appearing in eq .",
    "( [ watson ] ) because the @xmath61 transition amplitude with @xmath62 violates not only g - parity but p as well .",
    "note that the spatial component of the @xmath62 3@xmath49 state is even under @xmath63 , so that the @xmath62 3@xmath49 state is of odd parity  @xcite .",
    "we work to leading order in the weak interaction , so that @xmath64 is mediated by strong rescattering and thus vanishes for @xmath62 states , as the strong interaction conserves parity . at the energies appropriate to kaon decay ,",
    "the strong scattering in the @xmath55 final state is described by a pure phase , as the empirical inelasticity parameters are unity  @xcite , so that in the isospin - perfect limit we can write @xmath65 thus if isospin is a perfect symmetry , only @xmath59 contributes to the sum and one recovers the usual parametrization @xmath66 noting by cpt symmetry that @xmath67 .",
    "we now turn to the consideration of isospin - violating effects .",
    "the @xmath45-matrix appropriate to the @xmath14 final states with zero net charge is characterized , in general , by eight real parameters .",
    "unitarity , however , yields three distinct constraints , and time - reversal invariance yields two more , so that the @xmath45-matrix can contain at most three real parameters .",
    "we have seen from the explicit form of @xmath45-matrix in the isospin - perfect limit that it is characterized by precisely two parameters , @xmath68 and @xmath69  and thus the third parameter permitted by unitarity and time - reversal invariance must be at least of @xmath2 , or of @xmath70 . as electromagnetic effects in the @xmath24 phases are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , we focus on @xmath26 effects .",
    "we parametrize the @xmath45-matrix in the presence of isospin violation as  @xcite @xmath71 where the third s - matrix parameter is denoted by @xmath72 .",

    "the parameter @xmath72 is sensitive to @xmath26 effects in the strong chiral lagrangian , as well as to electromagnetic effects .",
    "explicit calculation shows that all strong - interaction isospin - violating effects in @xmath14 scattering are at least of @xmath76 in in the chiral expansion  @xcite .",
    "this result persists to all orders in chiral perturbation theory ; let us turn to an explicit demonstration of this point .",
    "isospin violation in the s - matrix element for 2-to-2 @xmath14 scattering can occur in either the truncated , connected green function itself or in the external @xmath49 legs .",
    "the latter source of isospin violation emerges as in @xmath2 the @xmath77 and @xmath78 fields mix .",
    "diagonalizing the neutral , non - strange meson states of the strong chiral lagrangian yields , in @xmath79 , e.g. , yields the `` physical '' @xmath77 state in terms of the pseudoscalar octet fields @xmath77 and @xmath78  @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "an analogous formula exists in  @xcite .",

    "note that the decay @xmath82 is forbidden by bose symmetry in the isospin - symmetric limit , @xmath83 , so that the truncated , connected green function of interest must be at least of @xmath2 . including the @xmath84 `` penalty '' required to convert the @xmath78 to a physical @xmath77",
    ", one finds that isospin - violating effects arising from the external legs start in @xmath85 .",
    "one can also show that the @xmath26 effects in the truncated , connected green function associated with the 2-to-2 scattering of isovector pions also start in @xmath85 .",
    "following the `` spurion '' formulation  @xcite , a transition matrix element with su(2 ) violation must have the same properties as a su(2)-conserving transition matrix element containing a spurion , a fictitous particle which carries , in this case , the quantum numbers of the @xmath77 and a factor of @xmath84 .",
    "thus the spurion and the @xmath49 are both of negative g - parity , so that a transition of form @xmath86 is forbidden by g - parity and does not occur  @xcite .",
