    "in order to obtain an _ ab initio _ understanding of the electronic structure of solids , it is essential to understand the nature of electron correlations in them  @xcite .",
    "correlation being a real - space phenomenon , one possible way of visualising it is through the density - density correlation function defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the many - particle wave function of the system , @xmath2 is the total number of electrons in the system and @xmath3 is the density operator with @xmath4 being the coordinates of the @xmath5-th electron",
    ". one can easily show @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron pair - correlation function defined as @xmath8 above @xmath9 denotes the electronic charge density .",
    "pair - correlation function represents the probability that when one electron is observed say at point @xmath10 , another electron will be found in a characteristic volume @xmath11 located at @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "clearly it can be used to quantify the so - called  exchange - correlation hole \" associated with an electron in a many - electron system  @xcite .",
    "if we compute the fourier transform of the density - density correlator , we obtain the static structure factor @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 if we assume that the system under consideration is a crystalline system with @xmath15 unit cells , each of which has @xmath16 electrons in it so that @xmath17 , we can decompose @xmath13 as a sum of a  coherent \" and an  incoherent \" part @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a vector of the reciprocal lattice and the form factor @xmath20 defined as @xmath21 can be easily seen to be the fourier transform of the charge density of the system , while @xmath22 is referred to as the incoherent scattering function in the literature .",
    "it is intuitively obvious that being the expectation value of a two - electron operator , @xmath23 will be sensitive to electron correlations in the crystal , while @xmath24 , which is a one - electron operator , should be relatively insensitive to such effects .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath23 satisfies limiting conditions @xmath25 and @xmath26    one can perform the measurement of the static structure factor of a many - electron system in a variety of experiments such as electron scattering and x - ray scattering . for isolated atoms and molecules both electrons  @xcite and x - rays  @xcite are frequently used for such measurements , however , for crystalline sytems , x - ray scattering appears to be the method of choice  @xcite . in such measurements , the quantity @xmath27 in equations above is identifed with the momentum transferred by the incident particle ( electron or photon ) , to the many - electron system under investigation .",
    "keeping in mind the relationship between the static structure factor and the pair - correlation function ( cf .",
    "( [ eq - dcorr2 ] ) and ( [ eq - sqdef ] ) ) , it is thus possible to obtain the pair - correlation function from these measurements .",
    "however , in what follows , we will devote exclusively on the x - ray scattering based experiments . the coherent x - ray scattering ( bragg scattering ) , i.e. when the momentum transfer @xmath27 is equal to one of the vectors @xmath19 of the reciprocal lattice , is governed predominantly by the form factor @xmath24 .",
    "however , by concentrating on the measurements corresponding to those values of momentum transfer which are not equal to any reciprocal lattice vector , one can  according to eq.([eq - sq2])directly measure the incoherent scattering function . the experiments which concentrate on this region of @xmath27 correspond to incoherent x - ray scattering . for the case of incoherent scattering of x - rays from a crystalline solid at finite temperatures , assuming that the energy of the incoming x - rays is much higher compared to the binding energies of the constituent electrons , but still low compared to the rest energy of the electron @xmath28 ( so that the relativistic effects can be neglected ) , the scattering cross section , for a solid composed of light elements , can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath29 \\ ; \\mbox { , } \\label{eq - cross}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the classical electron radius , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the wave vectors of incoming and outgoing photons , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the corresponding polarization vectors , @xmath35 is the momentum transfer while @xmath36 is the structure factor due to the thermal diffuse scattering ( tds ) caused both by the thermal , and the zero - point vibrations of the lattice .",
    "thus @xmath36 quantifies the contribution of phonons to the x - ray scattering , and can be computed by taking one - phonon , and higher order terms into account  @xcite .",
    "therefore , by measuring the incoherent x - ray scattering cross section for different values of the momentum transfer @xmath27 , combinded with the knowledge of @xmath36 , one can , using eq .",
    "( [ eq - cross ] ) , extract the incoherent scattering scattering function @xmath23 of the system under consideration .",
    "sacchetti and coworkers  @xcite have been the proponents of using the incoherent x - ray scattering to measure the static structure factor of crystalline compounds , for its subsequent use in the analysis of electron correlation effects .",
    "they have performed a series of accurate measurements of the static sturcture factor of the metallic system be  @xcite and the covalent system diamond  @xcite to obtain their pair - correlation functions , and analyzed various contributions to the ground state energies of these compounds . in their latest experiment performed on crystalline lif , they have , for the first time , subjected an ionic system to a similar analysis  @xcite . however , in order to quantify the contribution of electron correlation effects to the experimentally measured static structure factor in such experiments , benchmark hartree - fock ( hf ) results for the quantity are needed . it is the purpose of this paper to present a formalism using which one can perform such benchmark hf calculations within an _ ab initio _ framework .",
    "indeed , calzuola et al .",
    "@xcite , by comparing their experimentally measured values of the static structure factor , to the benchmark hf values presented here , have estimated the correlation contribution to the cohesive energy of lif .",
    "therefore , the aim of these calculations is _ not _ to explain the experimental data , but rather to provide a theoretical reference , with respect to which the correlation effects can be quantified in the experimentally measured quantities .",
    "the formalism for computing the static structure factor presented here is based on a wannier - function - based _ ab initio _",
    "hf approach developed recently by us  @xcite .",
    "the approach has since been applied to compute the ground state properties of a number of ionic  @xcite and covalent compounds  @xcite , including the form factor ( @xmath20 ) of lif  @xcite .",
    "remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we describe our formalism for the _ ab initio _ evaluation of the incoherent scattering function within an hf approach .",
    "an explicit formula is presented which represents @xmath23 in terms of the wannier functions of an infinite crystal .",
    "our numerical results for lif are presented in section [ results ] which are compared to the experimental results of calzuola et al .",
    "@xcite for the same compound .",
    "finally our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "here we outline the evaluation of the incoherent scattering function @xmath23 for an infinite crystalline insulator within an _ ab initio _ restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) approach .",
    "although , we are not aware of such a prior calculation for an infinite solid , we note that _ ab initio _ calculations are performed on a routine basis on isolated atoms   and molecules  @xcite , both at the hf , and the correlated level .",
    "however , for condensed - matter systems , perhaps because of practical difficulties associated with providing a wave - function - based _ ab initio _ description of an infinite system , such calculations are either performed assuming a jellium model for the electrons of the system  @xcite , or within the framework of the density functional theory which often involves phenomenological approximations  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the compound under consideration is a closed - shell crystalline system whose rhf ground state can be described by @xmath37 doubly occupied wannier functions per unit cell , so that @xmath38 . if we use greek indices @xmath39 , @xmath40 etc .",
    "to denote the wannier functions localized in a given unit cell , the rhf wave function of the infinite crystal can be described as a slater determinant composed of the infinitely many wannier functions @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the @xmath39-th wannier function of a unit cell located at the position given by the vector @xmath43 of the lattice .",
    "the aforementioned wannier functions are assumed to form an orthonormal set @xmath44 and wannier functions localized in different unit cells are translated copies of each other @xmath45 where the operator @xmath46 represents a translation by lattice vector @xmath47 .",
    "the theory and several applications of our approach , which directly obtains the rhf wannier functions of a crystalline insulator ( ionic or covalent ) , have been presented in several papers  .",
    "if we use the standard formula for the expectation value of a two - particle operator with respect to a slater determinant  @xcite , one can , after some algebraic manipulations , show that in the wannier representation the rhf expression for the incoherent scattering function ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq - sq ] ) ) is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents a wannier function localized in the reference unit cell .",
    "( [ sq - fin ] ) constitutes the key formula of this work , a detailed derivation of which is presented in the appendix . since the wannier functions in our computer code are represented in terms of gaussian lobe - type localized basis functions , it is possible to write down analytic expressions for the matrix elements needed to evaluate @xmath23 according to the expression above . the lattice sum over lattice vectors @xmath47 involved in eq .",
    "( [ sq - fin ] ) decreases rapidly as one moves away from the reference cell , and is terminated once the convergence within a given threshold is achieved .",
    "the restriction of the present approach to insulators stems from our use of wannier functions as the single - particle orbitals , rather than the conventional bloch orbitals .",
    "it is easy to see that the same theory can be easily extended to metallic systems if one were to express the many - body wave function of the solid in terms of bloch orbitals . in that case , of course , the real - space sum ( cf .",
    "eq.([sq - fin ] ) ) will have to be replaced by an integration over the brillouin zone .",
    "we will present this generalization in a future paper .",
    "this will be particularly useful in light of the future experiments which sacchetti and coworkers are planning on metallic systems  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the results of our hf calculations of the incoherent scattering function at different values of the momentum transfer , and compare our results to the experimental ones .",
    "it is intuitively obvious , however , that hf structure factors can only describe the experimental results qualitatively  in order to obtain a better quantitative description theoretically , inclusion of electron correlation effects is essential .",
    "nevertheless , in our opinion , the comparison with experiments is very instructive , because one can , in a rather pictorial way , see the successes and failures of the hf approximation in describing the physics of weakly - correlated systems .",
    "the basis set used to represent the wannier functions in our calculations was the lobe representation of the basis set proposed by prencipe et al . in their bloch - orbital - based hf study of the structural properties of lif  @xcite .",
    "the basis set consisted of contracted cartesian gaussian - type basis functions and was of [ 4s,3p ] type for the fluorine atom , and [ 2s,1p ] for the lithium atom . for further details pertaining to the exponents and the contraction coefficients we refer to the original work  @xcite .",
    "details dealing with the lobe representation of the cartesian gaussian basis functions can be found , e.g , in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "we also examined the basis - set dependence of our results on @xmath23 by performing calculations with larger basis sets which also included d - type basis functions on f atom , however , we did not observe any significant change in the results .",
    "thus we believe that our results on @xmath23 presented below are fairly accurate .    in the theoretical calculations the observed face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure",
    "was assumed for the compound .",
    "the reference unit cell was taken to be the primitive cell with the f atom at @xmath50 position and the li atom at @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the lattice constant .",
    "for the lattice constant , the room temperature value of @xmath53 was used .",
    "the results of our calculations are are summarized in table [ tab - sq ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - sq ] which present @xmath54 as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath27 , where @xmath55 for the case of lif .",
    "direction of the momentum transfer for both the theory and the experiment was along [ 100 ] direction .",
    "theoreitcal hf values of @xmath23 were calculated with the magnitude of the momentum transfer @xmath56 ranging from 0.0 to 15.0 atomic units ( a.u . ) .",
    "for the experimental data , @xmath56 ranged from 0.517 a.u . to 7.622 a.u .",
    "it is quite clear from fig .",
    "[ fig - sq ] that hf theory is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental result , which is a manifestation of the fact that lif is a weakly correlated system .",
    ".comparison of the hartree - fock incoherent scattering function ( @xmath57 ) computed in this work with those measured in the experiment of calzuola et al .",
    "@xcite at selected values of momentum transfer @xmath27 .",
    "the momentum transfer was along the [ 100 ] direction in both the experiment and the theory . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - sq ]    in order to quantify the correlation effects , we define the quantity @xmath58 , which clearly measures the percentile contribution of electron correlation effects to the experimentally measured @xmath23 , using the hf values presented here as the benchmark reference .",
    "@xmath59 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - eq ] , as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "for the smallest value of the momentum transferred measured @xmath60 a.u . , the correlation contribution is @xmath61 . with the increasing momentum transfer the correlation contribution decreases rapidly staying in the range @xmath62 %  @xmath63 % from @xmath64 a.u . to @xmath65 a.u .. from @xmath66 a.u . onwards the uppper bound for the correlation contribution is approximately three percent , while most of the points are in one to two percent range .",
    "we also see some oscillations in the @xmath59 as a function of the momentum transfer , which may be due to the experimental uncertainties .",
    "however , the general trend in @xmath59 as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath27 is clear  the contribution due to the correlation effects decreases with the increasing momentum transfer .",
    "this trend is also observed in the calculations involving free atoms and molecules where the hf calculations for small values of momentum transfer always overestimate @xmath23 as compared to the correlated ones  .",
    "this trend can be understood as follows .",
    "hf theory , because of a lack of correlations in it , will always overestimate the pair - correlation function @xmath67 and consequently @xmath23 . since for small values of momentum transfer @xmath56 , one can only probe the valence electrons , the main contribution to @xmath23 will also naturally come from these electrons .",
    "however , it is the valence electrons for which the correlation effects are quantitatively the most important , and their neglect in the hf approach leads to relatively large deviations , as compared to the experimental values , for smaller values of momentum transfer .    in our calculations we did not observe any significant anisotropy in @xmath23 with respect to the direction of @xmath27 .",
    "we performed the same set of calculations for @xmath23 for momentum transfer directions [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] as well , however , the difference in the results compared to [ 100 ] direction was always less than @xmath68 .",
    "this result can also be understood on intuitive grounds as the charge density in lif is fairly isotropic , therefore , one would not expect the incoherent scattering function to show any anisotropy .",
    "finally it is clear from both table [ tab - sq ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - sq ] that our hf results on @xmath23 approach the correct limiting values in both the low momentum - transfer region ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq - qzero ] ) ) and the high momentum - transfer region ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq - qinf ] ) ) .",
    "in conclusion a wave - function - based fully _ ab initio _ approach has been presented , using which , one can compute the static structure factor of a crystalline compound at arbitrary values of the momentum transfer , at the hf level .",
    "the formalism was applied to the case of crystalline lif , and benchmark values were obtained for its incoherent scattering function .",
    "these values were used in the analyssis of a recently performed incoherent x - ray scattering experiment on lif to quantify the electron correlation effects , in general , and to predict the correlation contribution to its cohesive energy , in particular  @xcite . in case",
    "such experimental measurements are performed on other insulating compounds , one can use the formalism presented here to perform similar benchmark calculations on those systems as well .",
    "the present version of the theory is restricted to insulating systems because of its wannier - function - based formulation , however , in light of the planned future experiments on metallic systems  @xcite , we do intend to develop an _ ab initio _ hf formalism meant for computing @xmath23 for gapless systems , as well .    although the aim of the present hf formalism was not to explain the experimental data , but rather to facilitate its analysis , it is still of interest to include electron correlation effects theoretically .",
    "indeed , recently , we have generalized our wannier - function - based approach to include electron correlation effects by systematically enlarging the many - particle ground - state wave function by considering virtual excitations from the space of the occupied wannier functions to that of the virtual ones  @xcite .",
    "the approach was demonstrated by computing the correlation contributions to the total energy per unit cell of bulk lih  @xcite",
    ". however , the generalization of the approach to compute the correlated expectation value of an operator other than the hamiltonian is far from trivial , and will be the subject of a future investigation .",
    "it is my pleasure to thank professor f. sacchetti for bringing his experiments to my attention , and for encouraging me to do these calculations .",
    "i would also like to thank professor p. ziesche for his thorough reading of the manuscript , and for providing an exhaustive list of references on the subject .",
    "thanks are also due to sumit mazumdar for his critical comments .",
    "finally , i would like to express my gratitude to professor p. fulde for supporting my research throughout my stay in the max - planck - institut fr physik komplexer systeme , dresden .",
    "our aim in the present section is to present a derivation of eq.([sq - fin ] ) of the text which is an rhf level expression for @xmath23 in terms of corresponding wannier functions .",
    "eq.([eq - sq ] ) which defines @xmath23 involves the expection value of the operator @xmath69 although operator @xmath70 is a sum of two - electron terms , however , unlike other similar operators such as the coulomb interaction operator , the sum in eq.([eq - xop ] ) does contain the term where @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , in order to utilize the well - established formulas for matrix elements of two - electron operators between slater determinant  @xcite , we rewrite eq.([eq - xop ] ) as @xmath72 where the first term on the right - hand side corresponds to @xmath71 terms of the sum in eq.([eq - xop ] ) and the operator @xmath73 is defined as @xmath74 @xmath75 , which represents the complex conjugate of operator @xmath73 , can be easily deduced from eq.([eq - yop ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath73 ( and hence , @xmath75 ) as defined above are traditional two - electron operators . utilizing the well - known formula for the expectation value of a general two - electron operator @xmath76 with respect to a single slater determinant state @xmath77  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 ,",
    "@xmath80 are the orbitals constituting the slater determinant , one can easily get @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents the single - slater - determinant rhf ground state of the crystalline insulator under consideration . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , it is expressed in terms of wannier functions @xmath41 , where @xmath83 is the number of electrons per unit cell and @xmath15 is the total number unit cells considered . in order to arrive at the right - hand side of eq.([eq - yop2 ] ) spin summations have been performed , and the first term represents the so - called  direct \" contribution , while the second term represents the `` exchange '' contribution .",
    "it is clear that both the direct , as well as the exchange terms are expressed as products of two one - electron matrix elements which are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "moreover , using the defining eq.([eq - fq ] ) , one can easily see that , for the rhf state considered here , the direct term of eq.([eq - yop2 ] ) is nothing but the product of the form factor @xmath20 and its complex conjugate , leading to @xmath84 finally , using the translational invariance property of the one - electron matrix elements latexmath:[$\\langle \\beta({\\bf r}_{j})| e^{i{\\bf q}\\cdot   { \\bf r}}|\\alpha({\\bf r}_{i } ) \\rangle = \\langle \\beta({\\bf r}_{j}-{\\bf r}_{i } )    rearranging the sum over lattice vectors @xmath47 and @xmath43 in eq.([eq - yop3 ] ) , one gets in the infinite solid limit ( @xmath86 ) @xmath87 if we combine the results of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - xop]),([eq - xop2 ] ) , ( [ eq - yopfin ] ) , and substitute them in eq.([eq - sq ] ) , we immediately obtain eq.([sq - fin ] ) , valid for a single slater determinant rhf wave function @xmath82 ."
