    "in the current hierarchical clustering models , galaxies form by gas cooling inside virialized cold dark matter haloes in a way that makes their properties depend only on the halo mass in which they form .",
    "recently , results from @xmath12-body simulations have shown that the halo clustering at large - scales depends on the halo formation history in addition to the halo mass @xcite .",
    "this effect , that is not expected from the excursion set theory , was termed `` assembly bias '' .",
    "for example , gao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that low - mass haloes which were assembled at high redshifts are more strongly correlated than those of the same mass that assembled more recently .",
    "therefore , one could ask whether the assembly bias could also affect galaxy properties .    by means of a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation ,",

    "the existence of the assembly bias is still debated .",
    "for example , skibba et al . (",
    "2006 ) used galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",

    "tinker , wetzel @xmath13 conroy ( 2011 ) found similar results , indicating that this dependence arises just from the correlation between halo mass function and environment .",

    "zapata et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that sdss galaxy groups of similar mass and different assembly histories show differences in their fraction of red galaxies .",
    "furthermore , cooper et al . (",
    "2010 ) studied the relationship between the local environment and properties of galaxies in the red sequence . after removing the dependence of the average overdensity on colour and stellar mass by setting a density parameter as a estimator of environment such",
    "as it is independent of these galaxy properties , they still found that galaxies with older stellar populations occupy regions of higher overdensities compared to younger galaxies of similar colours or stellar masses .",
    "also , alonso et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show that galaxies in groups in low global densities are prone to show higher star formation compared to galaxies of equal properties and similar host groups but in high density environments .",
    "these results show that the concept of assembly bias is applicable to the galaxies in addition to dark matter ( dm ) haloes and would then influence the physics of galaxy formation . also , this effect is important when galaxies are used to constrain cosmological parameters .",

    "2009 ) can infer significantly biased cosmological parameters from the observed clustering amplitude of galaxy clusters if the assembly bias is not taken into account .",
    "paper i presented a new peak height definition different from the halo virial mass , where semi - analytic galaxies in haloes of a given mass but different age do not show the assembly bias effect in the two - halo regime .",
    "this new definition simply adds mass to that of the dark matter halo in a way that makes old , low - mass haloes suffer the most extreme peak height change with respect to what results of using the virial mass as its proxy . in this paper",
    "we will test this model using galaxies selected from the sdss catalogue with the difference that , instead of using the total mass inside spheres of different radii , we will use the total luminosity inside cylinders along the position of each galaxy , which we will use to make a more adequate proxy for a peak height , in a similar way to what was proposed in paper i. we will discuss the implications of using discrete tracers of the density field that consider neighbour galaxies instead of a smooth density field .",

    "the idea behind our work is not to minimize the bias , but it is to use this method to understand the physical features that produce the assembly bias .    instead of using spheres as in paper i , we measure the total luminosity ( which correlates with total substructure mass ) inside a cylinder centred on each galaxy along the line - of - sight to take into account the limitations imposed by the redshift space distortions .",

    "notice that this cylinder will include neighbour galaxies and therefore this will be related to the crowding of the environment of the galaxy , a measure of the local density , but with an adaptive volume size depending on the galaxy age and luminosity .",
    "this procedure to trace the assembly bias will use correlation functions of relatively old and young galaxies to fit the parameters of the cylinder radius , but this parametrization will only be said to correlate with the correction of paper i ( missing peak mass ) if the excess of crowding in galaxies correlates with the excess of mass found in haloes reported in our previous paper . in order to demonstrate that this is the case ,",

    "we adapt this model including observational issues using galaxy luminosities , taking advantage of their correlation with substructure mass . as the sdss",
    "is limited in flux , and as the tracers of mass are the galaxies themselves , the method is modified to use the crowding of the environment around galaxies in selected volume - limited samples , instead of searching for a correction to the virial mass as was done in paper i. we measure the total light in cylinders centred in each galaxy , thus obtaining an estimate of the crowding around galaxies , that traces the asembly bias .",

    ", it is obtained that the set of best - fitting parameters for the radius of the cylinder is @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "this latter model , which constitutes a discrete formalism when counting galaxies within a cylinder or haloes within spheres , does not reproduce the original luminosity or mass functions since it actually measures the crowding around galaxies .",
    "however , it is correlated with the smooth density field approach of paper i. therefore , both formalisms are associated with the fact that the mass of peaks that did not collapse on to haloes will not be an appropiate proxy for the peak height .",
    "it is likely that low - mass haloes in high density environments show their growth truncated by the gravitational effects of their ( massive ) neighbours .",
    "our results indicate that this also affects the growth of the stellar mass in galaxies in addition to the growth of dark matter haloes .",
    "this could induce a misclassification of galaxies in theoretical models to populate haloes , such as hod , because using virial mass instead of proper peak height .",
    "these results will be of high importance for the next generation of galaxy surveys , such as lsst .",
    "the huge amount of information available will allow us to measure the clustering amplitude of galaxies with significant statistics at mpc scales .",
    "therefore , as we show in this paper , it will be absolutely necessary to model the effect of the environment on the two - halo regime in order to understand its role in the formation and evolution of haloes and galaxies .",
