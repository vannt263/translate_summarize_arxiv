    "there has been a great deal of interest in the left - right symmetric electro - weak gauge theory  @xcite in recent years due its potential accessibility at the lhc . after more than four decades since its birth",
    ", there is finally hope that experiment could confirm it .",
    "moreover , it has emerged  @xcite that the minimal such model is a self - contained and predictive theory of neutrino mass in full analogy with the standard model ( sm ) for the higgs origin of charged fermions masses .",
    "we can say that what seemed originally its curse , the prediction of massive neutrino , over the years turned into a great blessing . in this , the crucial role was played by the seesaw mechanism  @xcite which not only suggestively accounts for small neutrino mass , but moreover makes it be of majorana nature .",
    "this implies lepton number violation ( lnv ) both at low energies through the neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite and at high energies through a production of same sign charged lepton pairs at hadronic colliders  @xcite . in the minimal left - right symmetric model ( lrsm )",
    "there is a deep connection between these processes  @xcite .",
    "there has recently been another important advancement in the minimal lr model , the analytic expression for the right - handed quark mixing matrix , in all of the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "it showed that the left and right - handed mixing angles are remarkably close to each other in spite of near maximal parity violation in low energy weak interactions .",
    "the lr symmetric theory is the simplest realization of the idea of the restoration of parity at the fundamental level .",
    "lr symmetry is broken spontaneously , and parity violation is supposed to be a low energy accident . since it was known fairly early that the right - handed ( rh ) charged gauge boson @xmath0 had to be very heavy due to its impact on the @xmath1 mass difference , on the order of few tev  @xcite , one had to wait for the advent of lhc in order to study it experimentally .",
    "this limit has been revisited in recent years  @xcite and definitively estimated to lie in the full lhc reach  @xcite , which ranges up to @xmath2 tev for the @xmath0 mass  @xcite .",
    "this value would make neutrinoless double decay likely to be seen , even if it were not due to neutrino mass .",
    "the lhc is slowly but surely getting there  @xcite , with the limit @xmath3 tev in a large portion of the parameter space of rh neutrino masses .",
    "it is then important to study carefully the lrsm in its full glory , including the higgs sector .",
    "the original analysis of the higgs sector goes back almost forty years  @xcite , and it had cleared some essential features of the lr theory , such as the issue of flavor violation in the neutral scalar sector .",
    "it was quite comprehensive , but it had to do with the outdated version of the theory with dirac neutrinos .",
    "the changes are not dramatic , basically they reduce to the existence of doubly charged scalars .",
    "they are important though to be taken into account and were discussed first in  @xcite and most recently in  @xcite .",
    "the previous studies lacked the computation of the masses and mixings of scalar particles in the whole ( phenomenologically relevant ) parameter space .",
    "it is not the only reason that drove us to go through this not very inspiring task plagued by computational tedium , although we believe that this by itself ought to suffice .",
    "the main issue for the low scale lrsm , the one accessible at the lhc , is the issue of stability and perturbativity of the potential at higher energies .",
    "namely , the low energy constraints from meson mixing , the same that drive @xmath0 to be heavy , imply a stringent limit  @xcite on the mass of the additional higgs doublet necessarily present in the minimal model on the order of 20 tev  @xcite , which leads to a worry of possibly too large couplings in the higgs potential .",
    "this was recently studied in  @xcite , where it was deduced that the theory can be perturbative for the lhc scale of symmetry breaking , but that it lives dangerously .",
    "we discuss this issue further , and in particular address the question of the cut - off scale where the theory ceases to work .",
    "we show that the closeness of the cut - off to the lr symmetry breaking scale brings important consequences on the parametric space of the model .",
    "there is more to it .",
    "after all , the lr scale is not predicted by theory and strictly speaking it can be anywhere between tev and the planck scale .",
    "obviously , the lhc reach is of great importance but one should be getting ready for future hadronic colliders , now being planned",
    ". there have already been studies devoted to this possibility , such as  @xcite , with a hope of reaching the lr scale around 20 tev .",
    "we find that in this case the theory is perfectly perturbative and the cut - off can be far away the mass of @xmath0 , allowing for a natural suppression of ultra - violet ( uv ) non - renormalizable operators .",
    "another important scale is the one suggested by the minimal @xmath4 grand unified theory ( gut ) , around @xmath5 gev .",
    "we run the whole parametric space of the model in order to check if the scalar sector remains perturbative preserving the picture of the two steps symmetry breaking . as a result",
    ", we get the generic constraint that the quartic couplings have to be of order of few percent , favoring marginally light scalars .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we review briefly the essential features of the minimal left - right symmetric model . in the section  [ iii ]",
    "we give the scalar mass spectrum and the relevant mixings .",
    "we offer simple symmetry arguments behind our results in order to facilitate the reading of the paper and as a check of our computations .",
    "we also give the physical quartic and cubic couplings and discuss the deviations from the sm results . in the section  [ iv ]",
    "we apply our results to the question of stability and perturbativity of the potential .",
    "we pay special attention to the issue of the cut - off which signals the breakdown of perturbativity at higher energies . in section  [ qver ]",
    "we consider the vertex renormalization , explicitly showing where the relevant vertices vary from the tree - level ones .",
    "finally , in section  [ v ] we offer a summary and outlook of our results . the paper is completed by three appendices where we give some of the more technical details .",

    "where rh neutrinos can be actually seen at the colliders , @xmath65 gev , @xmath32 becomes completely negligible .    in what follows we thus work in the limit @xmath66 ( or equivalently @xmath67 ) .",
    "the question is whether it is technically natural .",
    "the positive answer was given already in the original work  @xcite but we go through it once again for the sake of completeness .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath32 is generated by the @xmath60 terms in the potential , and the smallness of @xmath32 is directly controlled by the smallness of @xmath59 couplings .",
    "it is equally easy to see that in the limit @xmath68 there is more symmetry in the potential , e.g. @xmath69 which guarantees its stability to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this symmetry is broken only by the yukawa couplings of @xmath41 , the same ones that lead to the seesaw picture since @xmath53 have the same couplings because of the lr symmetry .",
    "in short , @xmath32 is naturally small in the technical sense , and in principle its effect can be sub - dominant to the usual seesaw contribution of rh neutrinos to neutrino mass . yet , from time to time , it is erroneously claimed that small @xmath32 requires fine - tuning , and that it is more natural to decouple @xmath41 from the theory in order to have its vev small .",
    "we disagree with this for a number of reasons that we now go through .    first , large scales are far less natural than small ones because they bring in the usual hierarchy problem .",
    "second , in order to decouple @xmath41 one needs to break the discrete lr symmetry at a large scale by the @xmath40 gauge singlet vev  @xcite , but this is effectively equivalent to the soft explicit breaking since the final result are different masses for the lh and rh scalar triplets .",
    "one may argue  @xcite that this happens naturally in a grand unified embedding in @xmath4 where the @xmath40 singlets are often automatically present .",
    "fair enough , but then @xmath70 is predicted to be huge , around @xmath5 gev  @xcite so that @xmath32 is automatically small .",
    "one may find ways to lower @xmath70 , but in that case one loses all the predictivity of grand unification and it becomes more semantics than physics .",
    "imagine for a moment that in any case one does invoke the gut fields to argue in favor of a parity odd @xmath40 gauge singlet field .",
    "in this case the lr theory has to remain perturbative and consistent all the way to the gut scale .",
    "we will show in the following section that for the lr scale accessible at the lhc , the theory breaks down quite quickly .",
    "it helps to raise the lr scale to the one reachable at the future colliders , but it is still not enough , the quartic couplings become large well below the gut scale .",
    "still , one can opt for the parity odd @xmath40 gauge singlet and claim that this helps the domain wall problem since the domain walls can be washed by the subsequent inflation . however , the domain wall problem is not so serious , for it may be solved by tiny planck scale induced gravitational effects  @xcite or through  @xcite the symmetry non - restoration at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "all this said , it is perfectly legitimate to decouple @xmath41 , but the naturalness argument is not the right one to use .",
    "bottom line : in the seesaw picture that we employ , we can work in the limit of vanishing both the @xmath32 and the @xmath59 couplings .    [",

    "it is enough to say that this case , being more constrained , is obtained from that of @xmath36 by requiring most of the couplings in the potential in   to be real .",
    "more precisely , a number of phases must vanish and the potential can be obtained from the one in the case @xmath36 @xmath72 we should add that in this case the mass term @xmath49 is automatically real , unlike in the case of @xmath36 which required a phase redefinition of @xmath48 .      before we go into the gory detail , it is instructive to anticipate the results on physical grounds , at least in the decoupling limit of large @xmath70 when the spectrum reduces to the sm higgs boson @xmath73 with the usual relation for its mass , the heavy triplets @xmath53 with @xmath74 couplings ( where @xmath75 stands for the appropriate combination the couplings @xmath57 ) and of the heavy flavor violating doublet from the bi - doublet with the mass - squared proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "these essential features get complicated by the possible mixings in the case of accessible scale @xmath70 , but most of them can be understood by symmetry arguments which we present below .",
    "the only relevant relation coming from the first - derivative minimization conditions is for a generic @xmath77  @xcite @xmath78 which holds for both the lr symmetries @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "there is an important disctinction though . in the case of @xmath35 ,",

    "@xcite , which from   implies latexmath:[\\[\\label{p_restriction }    @xmath36 the parameter @xmath81 is unconstrained and no further restriction emerges from  . in both cases ,",
    "as seen from  , there is no possibility for spontaneous cp violation as opposed the generic two higgs doublet situation ; the phase @xmath82 vanishes in the limit of explicit cp conservation ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the reason for this is phenomenological , not structural , as we can explain below .",
    "let us define the following couplings that are useful for the discussion below @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the quartic coupling of the sm higgs if the mixing with @xmath42 fields is neglected , @xmath86 is the quartic coupling that mixes the sm higgs with the new higgs boson in @xmath42 and finally @xmath87 is the effective quartic responsible of the electroweak corrections to the masses of the @xmath41 multiplets .",
    "notice that @xmath88 is negative since @xmath60 is limited due to the perturbativity of yukawa couplings  @xcite , and is controlled by the physical parameters as we discuss below .    as usual ,",
    "the next step is to write down the mass matrix through the hessian of the potential .",
    "it is useful to diagonalize it in two steps : in the first one , we neglect the mixing of the @xmath48 with @xmath42 ; in the second one , we consider the whole matrix .",

    "these doublets would mix , but here they are eigenstates to a great precision , since @xmath93 has to be extremely heavy , on the order of 20 tev .",

    "therefore we choose to focus in this section on the lrsm with @xmath183 tev , consistent with next generation colliders .",
    "this choice , besides eliminating any tension in the parametric space of the model , represents a scale for which the lrsm offers an insight on the strong cp problem .",

    ", we believe that it is not well motivated to focus on versions of the theory in which parity is broken at very high energy , while the gauge symmetry @xmath40 is preserved up to 10 - 100 tev - at least , not by appealing to grand unification .",
    "the quartic couplings become non - perturbative well below the gut scale and this holds even for the truncated potential  @xcite consistent with the high scale parity breaking picture .    in short , a rh scale in the range 10 - 100 tev leads to a well - defined perturbative model , with a high scale cutoff .",
    "moreover , the theoretical limits on the masses of @xmath41 states and @xmath138 are now gone away and one is left only with the experimental bounds on the order of a few hundred gev .         the lrsm can be naturally embedded in the @xmath4 gut with the generalized charge conjugation @xmath36 a discrete @xmath4 gauge symmetry . with the minimal fine - tuning hypothesis ,",
