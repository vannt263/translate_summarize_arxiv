    "mining frequent patterns is an important area of data mining where we discover substructures that occur often in ( semi-)structured data . in this work",
    "we will further investigate one of the simplest structures : itemsets .",
    "however the principles of balanced patterns are easily extended to sequential pattern mining , tree and graph mining . in earlier work we proposed an algorithm that discovers _",
    "stable patterns _ that occur at regular moments , or rather in regular intervals , enabling us to mine for events that occur , e.g. , every friday . in this work",
    "we will introduce a new approach to mining for patterns with a stable interval .",
    "note that the transactions in this paper have an order . in order to distinguish it from stable patterns",
    "we will call these new patterns _ balanced patterns_. with this new approach we will offer solutions for problems in our work done in @xcite :    * patterns occurring in every transaction made it hard to discover patterns with a more interesting intermediate interval . *",
    "the threshold for pruning was a certain value that a measure for stability needed to achieve . even though a formula was given to estimate this value",
    ", an easily understandable value was lacking .",
    "in section 2.1 we will repeat some important definitions to make this work self contained , however in depth information can be found in @xcite .",
    "we will define our approach to mining balanced patterns and show its usefulness . to this end",
    ", this paper makes the following contributions : +  we will * define balanced patterns and show their use*. these balanced patterns will enable the user to better filter uninteresting patterns ( section 2 ) .",
    "+  furthermore we will * propose an algorithm * that will enable us to mine balanced patterns ( section 3 ) .",
    "+  finally we will empirically show that * the algorithm can find interesting patterns * efficiently ( section 4 ) .",
    "a typical example is the mining of an access log from the computer science department of leiden university .",
    "this access log will first be converted to sets of properties we are interested in , e.g. , pages visited every half - hour . from here on we call this dataset the _ website _ dataset .",
    "this research is related to work done on the ( re)definition of support , using time with patterns and the incorporation of distance measured by the number of transactions between pattern occurrences .",
    "the notion of support was first introduced by agrawal et al . in @xcite in 1993 . since then many new and faster algorithms where proposed .",
    "we make use of eclat , developed by zaki et al . in @xcite .",
    "steinbach et al . in @xcite",
    "generalized the notion of support providing a framework for different definitions of support in the future .",
    "our work is also related to work described in @xcite where association rules are mined that only occur within a certain time interval .",
    "furthermore there is some minor relation with mining data streams as described in @xcite , in the sense that they use time to say something about the importance of a pattern .",
    "finally this work is related to some of our earlier work .",
    "results from @xcite indicated that the biological problem could profit from incorporating consecutiveness into frequent itemset mining , which was elaborated in  @xcite . in the case of stable patterns",
    "we also make use of the transactions and the distance between them .",
    "secondly in @xcite it was mentioned that support is just another measure of saying how good a pattern fits with the data .",
    "there we defined different variations of this measure , and stability can been seen as one such variation .",
    "stable patterns and an algorithm to discover them are defined in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will repeat the definition of stable patterns to better understand the problems and the difference with the definition of balanced patterns . in particular , patterns that occur at regular intervals ( e.g. , at equidistant time stamps ) will be called stable or balanced . in the case of",
    "_ stable patterns _ , in order to judge this property , we will determine how often events occur `` in the middle '' between two other events @xcite . in the case of _ balanced patterns _ we prune patterns that do not have at least one frequent intermediate distance ( between all occurrences ) and we filter those patterns that have a too high deviation for all distances between successive occurrences .",
    "furthermore we filter patterns that do not reach a certain minimal average distance for all successive occurrences .      in this paper",
    "a dataset consists of transactions that take zero time .",
    "each transaction is an itemset , i.e. , a subset of @xmath0 for some fixed integer @xmath1 .",
    "the transactions can have time stamps ; if so , we assume that the transactions take place at different moments .",
    "we choose some notion of _ distance _ between transactions ; examples include : ( 1 ) the distance is the time between the two transactions and ( 2 ) the distance is the number of transactions ( in the _ original _ dataset ) strictly in between the two transactions . in this paper",
    "we will use ( 2 ) in all our examples .",
    "we will define @xmath2 as the series of transactions that contain pattern ( i.e. , itemset ) @xmath3 ; the _ support _ of a pattern @xmath3 is the number of elements in this ordered series .",
    "we now define _",
    "@xmath4-stable patterns _ as itemsets that occur frequent ( support @xmath5 ) in the dataset and that have _ stability value _ @xmath6 , where the values @xmath7 and @xmath8 are user defined thresholds .",
    "@xmath4-good triple _ @xmath9 consists of three transactions @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , occurring in this order , such that @xmath13 ; here @xmath4 is a pregiven small constant @xmath14 , e.g. , @xmath15 .",
    "the stability value of a pattern @xmath3 is the number of @xmath4-good triples in @xmath2 , plus the number of transactions in @xmath2 that occur as left endpoint in a @xmath4-good triple , plus the number of transactions in @xmath2 that occur as right endpoint in a @xmath4-good triple .",
    "note that the stability value of a pattern @xmath16 with @xmath17 is at least equal to that of @xmath3 : the so - called apriori or anti - monotone property .",
    "also note that the stability value remains the same if we consider the dataset in reverse order .    in our work on stable patterns",
    "@xcite we showed that equidistant events are `` very '' stable ( in case @xmath15 ) .",
    "suppose we have the following itemsets in our dataset :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     finally we also applied the balanceclat algorithm to the nakao dataset used in @xcite . in this dataset",
    "each of the 2,124 transactions is a clone located on the human chromosomes .",
    "the items are the numbers of patients with a higher than normal value for this clone ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the specifics of the dataset can be found in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 was set @xmath20 , because the interesting patterns are expected to occur very close to each other .",
    "also @xmath21 because patterns where expected to have small periods of transactions where they occurred unbalanced .",
    "furthermore @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "results where similar to results found with consecutive support as presented in @xcite where most consecutive patterns occurred close together in chromosome 9 . in the future",
    "we plan to investigate this futher .",
    "we have presented a new way of mining for patterns occurring with a regular interval . in comparison with our previous method",
    "we now use a pruning threshold @xmath25 that is more intuitive to users . with it",
    "the user only indicates the number of times at least one intermediate distance should occur .",
    "such a distance is the number of transactions between two occurrences of the pattern ( we consider only distances below a maximal distance ) .",
    "finally in the future we plan to use balanced patterns in combination with new ways of filtering to facilitate the discovery of new patterns further .",
    "also research will be done on effectively visualizing balanced patterns .",
