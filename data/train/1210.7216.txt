    "since the early developments in the theory of quantum information , the task of coherently transferring quantum states through long and short distance communication lines has been of great importance . while photons are the ideal carriers of quantum information over long distances , it has become evident that the best possible method for transferring quantum information over short distances is to exploit the dynamics of many body systems , specifically of regular arrays of qubits constituting suitable spin chains .",
    "in this framework , an arbitrary qubit state is first coupled to the array and then carried to destination by the natural dynamics of the whole system , where it can be extracted with certain fidelity .",
    "this idea was first introduced in @xcite , where it was shown that the natural dynamics of a heisenberg ferromagnetic spin chain can achieve high - fidelity transfer of qubits over distances as long as 80 lattice units.in contrast to this traditional \" passive  protocol , different approaches soon emerged .",
    "one idea was to engineer the couplings between the various spins in the chain in such a way that states are transferred with perfect @xcite-@xcite or with arbitrary high fidelity @xcite-@xcite ; in addition , some minimal external control on the chain dynamics was also introduced in order to achieve similar results @xcite-@xcite . +",
    "quite recently it was shown @xcite that particular types of quasi - one dimensional uniformly coupled chains , can achieve perfect state transfer , provided that the natural dynamics of the chain be supplemented with some global control pulses at regular intervals of time .",
    "then it was shown in @xcite and using a different geometry in @xcite , that perfect routing of states in higher dimensional networks , from any point to any other point , is also possible .",
    "the advantage of these schemes was that they allowed simultaneous routing of multiple states and also the possibility of overcoming some of the restrictions of the previous protocols , notably introducing some robustness to local imperfections in the network .",
    "it is important to note that the introduction of external control is not in contrast with the spirit of quantum state transfer through the natural dynamics of the chain , as long as the external control is global and does not address individual qubits in the network .",
    "+ while these schemes are to some extent robust against localized imperfections in couplings , i.e. by routing around known defects in the network , the new element of global control inherent in these kinds of schemes brings about the question of their robustness to inaccuracies and imperfections of external control .",
    "we can ask to what extent the fidelities of these schemes is affected by imprecision in the timings and the direction of the applied fields in the global pulses , which are necessary for perfect routing of states . + it is on these novel stochastic disturbances that we shall focus in the present work .",
    "specifically we focus on the quasi - one dimensional chain of @xcite , which is the basic element in higher dimensional uniformly coupled networks .",
    "we show that for a moderate value of the noise in global control , one can still achieve a high value of fidelity .",
    "interestingly , we find that the transfer protocol appears to be less affected by correlated noise , as compared to un - correlated one ; this result may be of great interest in the actual realization of realistic spin chain channels , since it suggests that externally induced time - correlations may protect the efficiency of the spin transmission lines .",
    "+ although in general such noises affect the dynamics of the full chain in an analytically intractable way , we show that the fidelity of the state transfer can be exactly determined and analyzed .",
    "more specifically , we are able to compute the fidelity of the protocol , when the direction of the applied field and the timings of the pulses are not precisely tuned because of the presence of external stochastic noise .",
    "+ the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section we give a brief account of perfect state transfer in the quasi - one dimensional chain of @xcite .",
    "section 3 deals with the general formalism that allows to incorporate in the protocol the effects of the presence of disorder in the pulses .",
    "section 4 is instead devoted to the actual computation of the fidelity both in presence of un - correlated disturbances , and in the more interesting case of correlated noise .",
    "the final section contains a brief discussion and outlook .",
    "the prototype of many - body system that has been used in many protocols is the @xmath6 spin chain , consisting of a linear array of @xmath7 sites , to each of which a spin-1/2 operator with cartesian components @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is attached .",
    "the dynamics is then described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath11 where the sum is over the various bonds in the array ( see fig.(1 ) for the specific example discussed in the following ) .",
    "this type of interaction preserves the total component of the spin along the @xmath12-direction @xmath13=\\ , 0\\ , \\ ] ] and moreover does not evolve the uniform background state where all the spin projections along the @xmath12 direction are up , conventionally called the vacuum state @xmath14 : @xmath15 .",
    "further , let us denote with @xmath16 the single excitation state corresponding to the situation in which all spins are up except the one at site @xmath17 which is down ; the collection @xmath18 , @xmath19 , of these @xmath7 states , form a basis in the single excitation subspace of the total hilbert space of the system .    in order to transfer an arbitrary qubit state @xmath20 from site @xmath21 to site @xmath7",
    ", one may apply the following simple protocol .",
    "first , embed the qubit into the initial lattice state @xmath22 .",
    "then , let it evolve according to the natural chain dynamics through the lattice until it becomes , at a suitable instant of time , the state @xmath23 ; from this state , one can then extract the original qubit from site @xmath7 .    as mentioned before , one way to achieve this perfect state transfer",
    "is to carefully engineer the coupling constants ; this has been discussed in @xcite , where it was shown that a linear @xmath6 chain with local couplings of the form @xmath24 can indeed perfectly transfer a qubit to the end of the chain , at the specific time @xmath25 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the couplings will be uniform and indeed it has been shown that these are the only uniformly coupled chains which can achieve perfect state transfer .",
    "the specific chain analyzed in @xcite is shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the chain is uniformly coupled in the sense that all the couplings have the same modulus .",
    "the presence of @xmath28 couplings allows this chain to be broken up into a direct sum of sub - chains with just two and three sites , achieving perfect state transfer . to see this , consider the hamiltonian pertaining to this chain ; with reference to the labeling of the sites of fig.(1 ) , it can be expressed as @xmath29 which can be conveniently re - written as @xmath30\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath31        the orthogonality of the states @xmath32 shows that the diamond - shaped lattice can be studied as a chain formed by two - site and three - site elementary components as shown in fig.(1 ) ; we will refer to the latter as `` virtual chain '' and work with it from now on : it consists of @xmath33 three - site sub - chains plus an initial and a final two - site sub - chain .",
    "a convenient basis , in the single - excitation hilbert sub - space is then given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , made of the following orthonormal vectors @xmath36 note that the vector states @xmath37 , @xmath38 , correspond to single spin down at the site @xmath39 , like in the diamond - shape representation of the chain ; however , unlike in that one , the other vectors represent a single - excitation being in a superposition of a spin down at one site and down at the subsequent one .",
    "_ from now on we shall work within the representation based on the orthogonal states non - bold faced states in ( [ onb ] ) corresponding to the disjoint union of small chains . _ + as mentioned before , the time - evolution operator @xmath40 maps the single - excitation sub - space into itself . in the representation corresponding to the above orthonormal basis",

    "the use of @xmath45 and @xmath46 as generators of the blocks of the unitary time - evolution matrix @xmath47 follows from the expression  ( [ hamiltonian0b ] ) for the hamiltonian , whereby @xmath45 represents the first term in the sum , @xmath46 the second one and so on .",
    "one easily sees that , for @xmath48 , respectively @xmath49 , the unitaries in ( [ u2 ] ) , respectively ( [ u3 ] ) , realize prefect state transfers over the elementary two- , respectively three - site sub - chains .    besides the unitary evolution given by @xmath47 , the transfer protocol introduced in @xcite involves instantaneous strong pulses @xmath50 acting globally on the lower sites of the diamond chain in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the explicit form of the operator @xmath50 is most simply given in the language of the virtual chain and in the basis ( [ onb ] ) : p=    1&&&&&&&_x&&&&&&&1&&&&&&&_x&&&&&&&&&&&&&&_x&&&&&&&1    , [ pulse ] where @xmath45 appears @xmath51 times , each one of them coupling @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "thus , except for the initial and final sites of the virtual chain , the pulse @xmath50 transfers any single excitation at an end point of a given sub - chain to that of the contiguous one .",
    "the basic idea of the transfer protocol of @xcite is to use the unitaries @xmath47 to transfer a single excitation along the sub - chains , while using @xmath50 to make it jump from one sub - chain to the next . in practice ,",
    "the composite dynamics of the system , starting from the initial time @xmath56 to the final time @xmath57 , is then described by the unitary operator [ ute ] _ t_f = u_t_f - t_k+1pu_t_k+1-t_kpu_t_2-t_1pu_t_1  .",

    "then , from the explicit form that ( [ blockun ] ) , ( [ u2 ] ) and ( [ u3 ] ) take in this case , one easily sees that the initial state @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes the ground state , will be perfectly transformed into @xmath63 at the final time [ finaltime ] t_f=+k  . from this final state",
    ", the single qubit @xmath20 can be extracted from site @xmath7 , thus realizing its perfect transfer from the beginning to the end of the chain .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in order to transfer a generic qubit state [ initialstate ] |=    , =  , = e^-i  , 0  ,  02  , along the chain , one first embeds it into the left hand site of the chain itself as the state [ emb ] |=|0+|1  , where @xmath64 are the basis vectors in ( [ onb ] ) and @xmath65 is again the ground state . under the unitary action of the time - evolution ( [ ute ] ) , @xmath66 is transformed into @xmath67 ; since @xmath68 , [ stateattf ] |_t_f=|0+(_i=1^n_i(t_f)|i )  .",
    "the protocol purpose is to use the chain dynamics to transfer the state @xmath69 from site @xmath21 to site @xmath7 ; the state of the qubit at site @xmath7 is obtained by performing the partial trace ( @xmath70 ) over single - excitation states involving all sites but the @xmath7-th one of the projection @xmath71 ; this gives a @xmath72 density matrix [ densityn ] _",
    "n(t_f)=tr_n|(t_f)(t_f)|=        .",
    "the robustness of the transmission along the chain can be measured by computing the fidelity of the final mixed state at the site @xmath7 with respect to the initial pure one embedded at site @xmath21 ; it is given by [ fidelity ] f_=|_n(t_f)|=||^2 + 2||^2||^2re(_n(t_f))+||^2(||^2-||^2)|_n(t_f)|^2 .",

    "its average over all input states , given by @xcite [ avfid ] f:=_0 ^ 2d_0^f_=+|_n(t_f)|^2+re(_n(t_f ) ) , is a measure of the overall robustness of the transmission protocol .",
    "the fidelity is maximal , that is @xmath74 , in the case of the ideal perfect protocol embodied by the unitary evolution @xmath75 in ( [ ute ] ) with times as in ( [ time - int ] ) and pulses as in ( [ pulse ] ) .",
    "the success of the perfect state transfer depends on the precise control over the timing of the pulses and the direction of their field ; in particular , the pulse should be exactly of the form ( [ pulse ] ) to perfectly transfer the state from one sub - chain to the next .",
    "also the timing of these pulses should be precise and synchronous with the timing required for perfect state transfer within the sub - chains .",
    "a disorder in either the field direction or timing of the pulses may drastically reduce the fidelity of the final state .    in the following",
    ", we shall consider the case where external noise affects the protocol by modifying precisely these times and pulses . in practice , instead of those in ( [ time - int ] ) , we shall consider modified times of the form ( as before , the initial time is set conventionally to zero ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a stochastic process with random variables @xmath78 distributed according to joint probabilities @xmath79 .",
    "the stochastic process may be stationary or not , correlated or not and the stochastic variables may take real values in a discrete or continuous state space . for sake of simplicity , we shall only suppose them to have zero mean - values .",
    "analogously , we shall consider noisy pulses @xmath80 that , while keeping the block form ( [ pulse ] ) , will no longer consist of local pulses represented by @xmath45 , but by p(_i):=    i_i & _ i _ i & i_i    , that reduces to @xmath45 in the limit @xmath81 ; here , @xmath82 is also a stochastic process with probability distribution @xmath83 consisting of real stochastic variables @xmath84 with zero mean values .",
    "we shall collect the two stochastic processes into a single one , @xmath85 , with joint probabilities @xmath86 , that may even account for possible correlations between them .",
    "then , in presence of such kind of noise , the unitary evolution ( [ ute ] ) will be replaced by [ utenoisy ] ^()_t_f = u(_k+2-_k+1)p(_k+1)u(_k+1-_k)u(_2-_1)p(_1)u(_1 )  , where the dependence on the stochastic variables in the various contributions is explicitly shown . because of its very construction , despite the presence of a perturbing noise , @xmath87 will map the single - excitation sub - space into itself .",
    "thus , for each realization of the noise , the initial state ( [ emb ] ) will be mapped into another single - excitation state [ noisystate ]    at the @xmath7-th site , @xmath88 , given again by the matrix in ( [ densityn ] ) , but with @xmath73 replaced by @xmath89 , and similarly for the corresponding averaged fidelity @xmath90 ( see  ( [ avfid ] ) ) .",
    "however , a physically meaningful state for the system can only be obtained by averaging over all realizations of the noise ; the density matrix representing the state of the chain at the final time @xmath91 is therefore given by [ averstate ] ( t_f)=^()(t_f )  p()|^()_t_f^()_t_f|  , where the integration region is given by the space spanned by the values that the stochastic variables @xmath92 can take .",
    "then , the reduced @xmath7-site state at time @xmath91 will become [ noisydensity ] _",
    "n(t_f)=tr_n((t_f))=tr_n(^(t_f ) )  , so that the fidelity averaged over the disorder and over all initial states will be given by [ avvfid ] f=  p ( ) f^ ( ) = + |^()_n(t_f)|^2+re(^()_n(t_f ) )  .",
    "we are now faced with the task of computing the fidelity @xmath93 of the state ( [ noisystate ] ) with respect to the initial state to be transferred . for this type of dynamics , it is obviously impossible to determine the explicit form of the final state given any arbitrary initial state .",
    "nevertheless , as explicitly shown in ( [ avvfid ] ) , in order to evaluate @xmath93 , only the coefficient @xmath89 in the expansion ( [ noisystate ] ) is really needed .",
    "as already stressed , the crucial observation is that , in order to determine @xmath89 , one needs just follow the change of the last non - zero entry of the vector  @xmath94 under the sequential action of operators of the form ( [ u2 ] ) and ( [ u3 ] ) . in doing so",
    ", we shall explicitly write only those components of the transformed vector affected by the various unitary blocks .",
    "let us then consider the initial state @xmath95 ; the action of @xmath96 transforms it into @xmath97 .",

    "can then compute the mean fidelity @xmath93 and thus study the impact of the noise on the robustness of the communication line . in the next subsections",
    "we will study in detail state transfer degradation along the chain both in presence of independent and correlated stochastic processes . as we shall see , the transfer protocol turns out to be more robust in the latter case , _",
    "i.e. _ in presence of time - correlations .      the most common noise likely to affect spin chain communication lines is that generated by un - correlated disturbances : it can be described by totally independent stochastic variables @xmath111 and @xmath112 with uniform distributions . in this case ,",
    "the probability density @xmath113 factorizes @xmath114 where , for simplicity , we have assumed the same probability distribution for all pulses and all time variables .",
    "thus , the computation of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , needed in the evaluation of the fidelity , simplifies , @xmath117 reducing  ( [ averstate ] ) to the product of integrals for each stochastic variable .    in addition",

    ", @xmath162 and @xmath131 , with a probability distribution @xmath190 similar to the one in ( [ corr - pulse ] ) , the computation of the noise contributions to the averaged fidelity can be treated as in the previous case , leading to contributions of the form ( [ matrix - form ] ) . however , note that now , except for the first contribution , the matrix @xmath191 is no longer diagonal since it involves time differences ; indeed , instead of @xmath191 in ( [ diagaver ] ) , one has to use one with entries : @xmath192 , where , recalling ( [ lastcomp ] ) , @xmath193 is either @xmath194 , or its square .",
    "the behavior of the averaged fidelity in terms of the probability @xmath177 , for different values of the correlation parameter @xmath153 , at fixed @xmath135 and @xmath131 , is qualitatively similar to the one discussed before in the case of correlated pulses , given in fig.(3 ) . in particular",
    ", also in this case one observes that the fidelity is less affected by the presence of correlated noise , to the extent that when @xmath152 it acquires a constant value , independent from the length of the chain : @xmath195 this result is easily understandable ; indeed , when @xmath152 , all intermediate three - site sub - chains ( lower picture in fig.(1 ) ) remain perfect state transfer chains even in presence of noise , and only the first and the last two - site sub - chain fail to transfer the state perfectly , so that the actual length of the transmission line becomes effectively irrelevant .",
    "we have studied the effect of imperfections in the external control in schemes for perfect transmission of quantum states through a quasi - dimensional chain @xcite .",
    "such chains are to be connected to each other to form larger two and three dimensional networks @xcite,@xcite through which qubit states are to be routed from any point to any other point through the natural dynamics of the underlying xy hamiltonia when assisted by global control pulses .",
    "these protocols are by construction robust against known localized imperfections in the network structure ( un - desired couplings , etc ) .",
    "our study shows that as long as the quasi - one dimensional chains is concerned , such schemes are also robust against imprecision in the sequence of applied global pulses , at least for moderate level of noise and for moderate lengths of the chain .",
    "remarkably we have found that when the noise in successive applications of the pulses are correlated , the efficiency of the protocol is less damaged compared with the case when there is no correlations . despite the complications of natural dynamics intervened by global external pulses , we have been able to derive exact expressions for the fidelity of state transfer , by taking advantage of the sequential dynamics of the many - body state and following only the evolution of the relevant coefficient which is necessary for calculation of the fidelity .",
