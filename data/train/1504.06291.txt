    "the gauge hierarchy problem is one of the most important issues in the standard model ( sm ) , which has been motivating us to seek new physics beyond the sm for decades .",
    "the problem lies in the fact that quantum corrections to the self - energy of the sm higgs doublet quadratically diverges , and this divergence ( cut off by some new physics scale ) should be canceled by a fine - tuning of the higgs mass parameter when the cutoff scale is much higher than the electroweak scale , such as the planck mass .",
    "because of the chiral nature of the sm , the sm lagrangian possesses the conformal ( scale ) invariance at the classical level , except for the higgs mass term .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that once the classical conformal invariance and its minimal violation by quantum anomalies are imposed on the sm , it can be free from the quadratic divergences and hence the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "this picture fits a setup first investigated by coleman and weinberg  @xcite , namely , a u(1 ) gauge theory with a massless higgs field , where the classical conformal invariance is broken by quantum corrections in the coleman - weinberg effective potential , and the u(1 ) gauge symmetry is radiatively broken ( coleman - weinberg mechanism ) .",
    "although it is tempting to apply this coleman - weinberg mechanism to the sm higgs sector , this can not work with the observed values of top quark and weak boson masses , since the coleman - weinberg potential for the sm higgs field is found to be unbounded from below @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to pursue this scheme , it is necessary to extend the sm . among several new physics model proposals ( see , for example , @xcite ) ,",
    "classically conformal b - l extended sm proposed in @xcite is a very simple and well - motivated model .",
    "the b - l ( baryon number minus lepton number ) is a unique anomaly - free global symmetry in the sm , and it can be easily gauged .",
    "associated with gauging the b - l symmetry , three generation of right - handed neutrinos and a b - l higgs field are introduced to make the model free from all gauge and gravitational anomalies , and to break the b - l gauge symmetry . once the b - l gauge symmetry is broken , the b - l gauge field ( @xmath1 boson ) and the right - handed ( majorana ) neutrinos obtain their masses . with the majorana heavy neutrinos , the seesaw mechanism @xcite is automatically implemented . in @xcite , under a requirement of the classically conformal invariance",
    ", the radiative b - l symmetry breaking by the coleman - weinberg mechanism has been investigated .",
    "the b - l gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking by generating a negative mass squared for the sm higgs doublet .",
    "naturalness of the model requires the b - l symmetry breaking scale at or below the tev scale  @xcite , so that the lhc run-2 can test the model .    in this work ,",
    "we first consider a generalization of the classically conformal b - l model . with the same new particles ( three generations of right - handed neutrinos and a new higgs field ) ,",
    "the most general gauged u(1 ) extension of the sm is to introduce a u(1)@xmath0 gauge group , which is defined as a linear combination of the sm @xmath8 and the u(1 ) b - l gauge groups .",
    "thus , we investigate the classically conformal u(1)@xmath0 extended sm .",
    "u(1)@xmath0 charge assignments for particles which are different from those in the b - l model yield a drastic change in phenomenological consequences .    in this context",
    ", we consider the sm higgs vacuum stability .",
    "the sm higgs boson has been discovered at the lhc , and this marks the beginning of the experimental confirmation of the sm higgs sector",
    ". the observed higgs boson mass of around 125 gev @xcite ( see also the recent update from a combined analysis by the atlas and the cms @xcite ) indicates that the electroweak vacuum is unstable @xcite , since the sm higgs quartic coupling becomes negative far below the planck mass , for the top quark pole mass @xmath9 from the combined measurements by the tevatron and the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "this is a serious problem in our framework , since the instability of the higgs potential induces a large tree - level mass for the u(1)@xmath0 higgs field through its interaction term with the sm higgs doublet field , and spoils the coleman - weinberg mechanism for the u(1)@xmath0 sector .",
