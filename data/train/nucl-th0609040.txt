    "the inner crust of a neutron star consists of a coulomb lattice of nuclei embedded in a roughly uniform neutralizing background of electrons and in a sea of neutrons @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of uniform nuclear matter and the surface tension , both at large neutron excess , are essential to understanding of the equilibrium properties of matter in the crust .",
    "however , laboratory data on nuclei only reflect the bulk and surface properties of nearly symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "so far , calculations of the equilibrium properties of matter in the crust depend on the way to extrapolate the known bulk and surface properties to large neutron excess , which is different among earlier investigations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we systematically analyze the question of how the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter at subnuclear densities depend on the parameter characterizing the density dependence of the symmetry energy . in doing so , we utilize a macroscopic nuclear model @xcite in which the equilibrium nucleon distribution depends on the eos of nuclear matter through minimization of the energy density functional . one of the most important quantities is the charge number of the equilibrium nuclide . in a liquid - drop picture",
    "@xcite , this charge number is determined by the size equilibrium condition which controls the ratio between the coulomb and surface energies .",
    "this condition tells that the charge number squared is proportional to the surface tension and the nuclear volume . as we shall see , the density dependence of the symmetry energy , which controls the surface tension by affecting the nuclear density and the density of the neutron gas , controls the charge number as well .",
    "we also address the question of how matter with nuclei or bubbles melts into uniform matter with increasing density . in this melting process ,",
    "rodlike and slablike nuclei embedded in a gas of neutrons , as well as rodlike and roughly spherical neutron - gas regions ( bubbles ) surrounded by a nucleon liquid , are expected to occur @xcite . at a density",
    "where roughly spherical nuclei are so closely packed that they occupy about 1/8 of the system volume , the nuclei tend to be elongated and eventually fuse into nuclear rods .",
    "the advantage of this rod formation is a reduction in the total surface area from the roughly spherical case . however , whether bubbles and nonspherical nuclei actually appear in neutron star crusts depends on the critical density at which proton clustering instability occurs in uniform nuclear matter @xcite ; they are expected to appear when the density corresponding to the nuclear volume fraction of about @xmath1 is smaller than the critical density for proton clustering .",
    "we find that this critical density is in turn controlled by the symmetry energy at subnuclear densities .",
    "earlier investigations on such exotic nuclei are more or less based on specific nuclear models @xcite .",
    "an exception is the work by watanabe et al .",
    "@xcite which is systematic in the sense that the liquid - drop model calculations were performed in a way dependent on the proton chemical potential in pure neutron matter , @xmath2 , and the surface tension .",
    "it was found that the density at which the system dissolves into uniform matter increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "however , it remains to be clarified why some nuclear models @xcite predict the absence of bubbles and nonspherical nuclei .",
    "it is important to note that these models predict relatively high pressure for pure neutron matter ( or , equivalently , relatively small symmetry energy ) at densities around half the normal nuclear density , while the work by watanabe et al .",
    "@xcite uses a parametrization @xcite based on the microscopic calculations by siemens and pandharipande @xcite as the eos of pure neutron matter and fix the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "this parametrization is consistent with the recent green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) calculations @xcite at neutron densities up to about half the normal nuclear density",
    ". we will give a unified picture about the presence of bubbles and nonspherical nuclei by describing the pressure of pure neutron matter in terms of the density dependence of the symmetry energy .    the size and shape of nuclei in the crust",
    "bear relevance to the thermal and rotational evolution of neutron stars .",
    "this is because thermal conductivity and neutrino emissivity in the crust are controlled by electron - nucleus scattering @xcite , while the motion of superfluid neutron vortices in the crust is affected by vortex - nucleus interactions @xcite .",
    "however , real crustal matter has to be accompanied by defects and impurities , which can play a more important role in the star s evolution @xcite . in a real neutron star , furthermore , the nuclear system is more or less out of equilibrium in the course of mass accretion onto the surface of the star and the star s spin - down @xcite .",
