    "dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has been widely applied to many strongly correlated electron systems@xcite .",
    "since dmft takes local quantum fluctuations into account , it is especially successful for models whose many body effect comes from the on - site interaction , like hubbard@xcite or kondo@xcite@xcite ( double exchange ) model . correlated systems often exhibit different phases which are quite close in energy , and this proximity can lead to phase separation , which is often important for electronic physics@xcite .",
    "phase separation is in principle a `` global '' property of the phase diagram and requiring substantial effort to establish : one must compute the free energy over a wide parameter range , and then perform a maxwell construction . in this paper",
    "we show that within the single - site dmft formalism a straightforward calculation at a fixed parameter value can reveal the presence of phase separation .",
    "specifically , we find that at zero temperature , the dmft can give a ground state which is stable against small perturbations but is unstable to a large amplitude local perturbation ; at non - zero temperature the standard methods simply fail to converge to a stable solution . by computing the free energy and performing a maxwell construction",
    "we show that for wide parameter ranges this instability occurs in the regions in which phase separation exists . in a narrow parameter regime it signals instead the onset of a different , but apparently uniform , phase .",
    "we therefore propose that the instability of the dmft equations can be used as an approximate , computationally convenient estimator for the boundaries of the regimes in which phase separation occurs .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the model and then a zero temperature dynamical mean field analysis explicitly showing the instability . in section iii we calculate the full t=0 phase diagram in the energy - density plane , establish the regime of phase separation via the usual maxwell construction , and extend the treatment to @xmath0 . in section",
    "iv we discuss the implications of this instability . finally in section v we present a brief conclusion .",
    "in this paper , we consider the single orbital `` double exchange '' or kondo lattice model of carriers hopping between sites on a lattice and coupled to an array of spins .",
    "this model has been studied by many authors and contains important aspects of the physics of the `` colossal''@xcite magnetoresistance manganites and is also solvable in a variety of approximations , permitting detailed examination of its behavior .",
    "here we use it to investigate the physical meaning of a previously unnoticed instability of the dynamical mean field equations .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 with @xmath2 labeling the sites and the @xmath3 denoting the spins .",
    "we assume the spins are classical ( @xmath4=0 $ ] ) and are of fixed length .",
    "we choose the convention @xmath5 .",
    "the hopping @xmath6 defines an energy dispersion @xmath7 and thus a density of states @xmath8 . in our actual computations",
    "we specialize to the @xmath9 limit of the bethe lattice , for which @xmath10 because the availability of convenient analytical expressions allows us to accurately compute the small difference between free energies of different states .",
    "we choose energy units such that @xmath11 .",
    "we also note that the ground state properties of the model may be straightforwardly obtained , because for any fixed configuration of the spins the model is quadratic in the fermions and easily diagonalizable .",
    "we now present the dynamical mean field analysis of this model . in the single site dynamical mean field method@xcite , one neglects the momentum dependence of the self energy .",
    "the properties of the model may then be calculated by solving an auxiliary quantum impurity model , along with a self consistency condition . the quantum impurity model corresponding to eqn([eqs : h ] )",
    "is specified by the partition function @xmath12 with @xmath13 $ ] where the trace is over frequency , and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is determined by a spin - dependent mean field function @xmath16 . in a magnetic phase , @xmath17 .",
    "note that the assumption of classical core spins means that @xmath18 denotes a simple scalar integral over directions of the core spin @xmath19 , and that no berry phase term occurs in the argument of the exponential .",
    "the green function @xmath20 and self energy @xmath21 of the impurity model are given by @xmath22 @xmath23 is fixed by requiring the impurity green s function @xmath20 equals to the local green s function of the lattice problem .",
    "the form of the self consistency equation depends on the state which is studied . for a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state",
    ", it is @xmath24 while for a 2 sublattice antiferromagnetic ( af ) state , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the @xmath27 -sum is over tje reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) .",
    "the two equations become equivalent in the paramagnetic ( pm ) state where @xmath28    the solution of eqs [ [ eqs : dmft1 ] to [ eqs : dmft2 ] ] determines the magnetic phase , the single particle properties , and the free energy . in particular",
    ", in the dynamical mean field approximation the gibb s free energy is @xcite@xcite @xmath29 where the trace is over the spin and lattice degree of freedom .",
    "the helmholtz free energy is @xmath30 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the ground state energy ( helmholtz free energy ) is @xmath31 \\label{eqs : t0freeenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we also note that the solution @xmath32 defines an effective potential for the core spin , which depends on the angle @xmath33 between the core spin and local magnetization direction , so that @xmath34 with @xmath35 \\label{eqs : eeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the model is known to exhibit ferromagnetic , spiral@xcite and commensurate antiferromagnetic phases . for our subsequent analysis , an accurate determination of phase boundaries will be important .",
    "we therefore present here a few calculational details .",
    "we require the @xmath36 phase boundary separating the ferromagnetic and spiral phases@xcite@xcite .",
    "the energy of a spiral state may most easily be found by performing a site - dependent spin rotation to a basis in which the spin quantization axis is parallel to the local spin orientation",
    ". the problem may then be easily diagonalized . for the infinite dimensional bethe lattice one finds , for a diagonal spiral of pitch @xmath37 , that in the rotated basis , the local green function is given by@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath37 is the angle between two nearest neighbor magnetization , and tilde is used for the spiral states .    to locate the @xmath36 fm / spiral second order phase boundary , it suffices to expand ground state energy @xmath39 ( eqn([eqs : t0freeenergy ] ) ) to second order in @xmath37 .",
    "the energy difference between fm and spiral states is @xmath40 with @xmath41 equaling to @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the fm / spiral phase boundary is determined by @xmath44 .",
    "the model also exhibits phase separation in some regimes . to determine the boundaries of the regime where phase separation occurs",
    ", we use the dmft method to compute the helmholtz free energy as a function of occupation number @xmath45 ( eqn([eqs : latfreeenergy ] ) ) and then perform the maxwell construction .",
    "an example is shown in fig [ fig : pst0 ] .",
    "we find that in fact that over much of the phase diagram a phase separation between fm and @xmath46 af states preempts the formation of spiral or @xmath47 af state .",
    "the general structure of our phase diagram agrees with earlier work@xcite@xcite , but the precise locations of phase boundaries differ by roughly @xmath48 .",
    "in this section we show that the dmft equations exhibit an apparently previously unnoticed instability .",
    "we begin with @xmath36 . from eqn([eqs : dmft1 ] ) , the @xmath20 is @xmath49 where @xmath50 means the angular average with respect to the weight function @xmath51 , with @xmath52 defined in eqn([eqs : eeff ] ) . at zero temperature ,",
    "the only contribution of the angular average is from the absolute minimum of @xmath53 . to find the dmft solution at @xmath36 , one first _",
    "assumes _ the absolute minimum of @xmath53 occurs at a fixed value , for example @xmath54 , obtains @xmath55 from eqn([eqs : dmft3 ] ) , and gets the self energy @xmath56 from eqn([eqs : dmft1 ] ) .",
    "finally , one uses the @xmath23 obtained by the above procedure to calculate @xmath53 to see if the minimum is located at the point originally assumed .",
    "note that different ground states ( fm , af .. ) enter the above procedure only via the self consistent equation eqn([eqs : dmft2 - 0 ] ) ( or eqn([eqs : dmft2 ] ) ) .",
    "fig [ fig : instability ] shows that as density is increased at fixed large @xmath57 , the self consistency breaks down , in an unusual manner : @xmath53 remains locally stable ( slope around the assumed minimum @xmath58 remains positive ) but the global minimum of @xmath52 moves to @xmath59 . in the regime where this phenomenon occurs ,",
    "no solution of the dmft equations exists . any initial solution we have considered leads to a similar inconsistency ( as is shown in panel b of fig[fig : instability ] for the case of anitferromagnetism ) .",
    "this instability is also manifest at @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath60 is decreased at fixed @xmath61 , the convergence becomes slower and below some temperature @xmath62 , no stable solution can be found for a @xmath57-dependent range of @xmath61 .",
    "the absence of a solution for some range of @xmath61 can be seen in a different way by solving the model as a function of chemical potential @xmath63 fig [ fig : n(mu)t0.01](a ) shows that as @xmath63 is increasedat fixed low @xmath60 , a first order transition occurs to a paramagnetic state , with a corresponding jump in @xmath61 .",
    "associated with the first order transition is a coexisting region in which two solutions are locally stable ( fm with lower @xmath61 and pm with higher @xmath61 ) ; the dmft equations correspondingly have two solutions , which one is found depends on the initial seed .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in fig [ fig : n(mu)t0.01](a ) are obtained from initial seeds close to fm and pm states respectively .",
    "the absence of convergence may be understood from the density dependent effective potential , shown e.g. in fig [ fig : n(mu)t0.01](b ) .",
    "one sees that as @xmath61 is increased , @xmath64 decreases ; this is a precursor of the effect shown in fig [ fig : instability](a ) .",
    "indeed , the curve @xmath65 is reduced by an @xmath61-dependent scale factor .",
    "for @xmath61 larger than a critical value ( here @xmath66 ) , @xmath64 is small enough relative to the temperature that this region begins to contribute to @xmath67 , lowering the maximum @xmath68 that can be sustained and destabilizing the ferromagnetic solution .",
    "we argue in this section that the dmft instability documented in the previous section is a manifestation of competing instabilities ( primarily phase separation ) in the original model . to establish this we show in the panel ( a ) of fig [ fig : phasediagram ] a @xmath36 phase diagram in the density - coupling plane .",
    "the dash - dot line shows the phase separation boundary obtained from the global energy computation ; for @xmath61 above this line the model phase separates into an @xmath46 af and an @xmath47 fm state . the dotted line shows the phase boundary between uniform fm and spiral states .",
    "finally , the heavy solid line shows the region above which the fm dmft solution is unstable at @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath57 is large enough that the fm state is fully polarized ( @xmath69 ) , we see that the dmft instability line follows the phase separation line , but is inside the region of phase separation . we therefore suggest that in this region the dmft instability is a consequence of phase separation and this dmft instability line can be used as a rough estimate of the real phase separation boundary .",
    "when @xmath70 , the dmft instability indicates the presence of a spiral state with lower energy than the ferromagnetic state . for @xmath71",
    "( fig [ fig : phasediagram](b ) ) , there exists a narrow region of @xmath61 where none of the uniform phases we considered solve the dmft equations and the maxwell constructions seem not to indecate phase separation .",
    "we believe that in this region there exists a uniform non fm / af / spiral / paramagnetic state ( either the ground state or the phase separation beteen fm and that state ) which we do not know yet .    at @xmath0",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "the dmft instability is contained inside the regime of phase separation .",
    "for example , we show in fig [ fig : pst0.01](a ) the phase diagram and the range of dmft instability in the density - temperature plane for @xmath72 .",
    "the heavy line shows the boundary of the regime of phase separation obtained by maxwell construction : for @xmath73 , the phase separation is between fm and af(@xmath46 ) ; for @xmath74 , the phase separation is between pm and af(@xmath46 ) ; for @xmath75 , the phase separation is either pm - af(@xmath46 ) or fm - pm@xcite according to the location @xmath76 relative to the homogenous curie temperature ( dotted line ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the region where the dmft solution fails to converge at that given density @xmath61 ( the dmft equation has stable solution for all @xmath63 , see fig [ fig : n(mu)t0.01](a ) ) . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the dmft instability line denotes the temperature below which ( a ) the paramagnetic state is linearly unstable to antiferromagnetic and ( b ) no stable antiferromagnetic solution exists ( except @xmath46 ) .",
    "fig [ fig : pst0.01](b ) shows the results of a maxwell construction for @xmath78 and that at @xmath79 , presented as the difference between calculated free energy @xmath45 and the interpolating line @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "phase separation is seen to occur for @xmath82 , while the dmft instability range is @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we have found an instability in the ferromagnetic dmft equation for the single site double exchange model and shown that this instability corresponds to the fm / af phase separation when the coupling @xmath57 is larger than half bandwidth ( 2@xmath85 ) and to another ground state ( spiral ) in the small coupling region .",
    "there exists a small window , around intermediate @xmath57 , where no stable fm dmft solutions exist while the spiral or phase separation is not the ground state , and we believe there is a non fm / af / spiral / para ground state existing in this region .",
    "we have presented evidence that the instability is a signal , obtained from a calculation at a fixed parameter value , of the existence of an instability ( typically phase separation ) which normally is established via a global computation , comparing free energies at many different parameter values .",
    "we therefore propose that the dmft instability is a computationally convenient way to estimate the boundary of phase separation .                    in eqs([eqs :",
    "latfreeenergy ] ) , for fm and af states , the lattice green function @xmath86 are indicated in eqn([eqs : dmft2 - 0 ] ) and eqn([eqs : dmft2 ] ) , while the trace are over full and reduced brillouin zone respectively ."
