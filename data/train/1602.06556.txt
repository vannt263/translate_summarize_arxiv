    "the purpose of this paper is to look at schwinger pair creation in @xmath6 dimensional de  sitter spacetime ( @xmath7 ) , with special emphasis on the case of @xmath2 dimension .",
    "the schwinger effect , i.e. , pair production by a strong electric field , is a nonperturbative effect of quantum field theory in flat spacetime which was initially discovered in the pioneers works @xcite ; for a recent review see , e.g. , @xcite . despite tremendous efforts on the experimental point of view",
    ", it has never been detected so far .",
    "the main reason is that the number of pairs created is exponentially damped before a critical value for the electric field @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "new laser facilities @xcite are planned to be operational in the next ten years and might approach this critical electric field . in the meantime , another proposal is to change the perspective : whereas all the experiments aiming at detecting the schwinger effect are conducted on earth , one could look for the schwinger effect in astrophysical and cosmological systems .",
    "the review @xcite describes some of these ideas , and the stress is on the backreaction of the created pairs and its application to astrophysics . during inflationary magnetogenesis strong electric fields",
    "are also produced @xcite , which provides motivation for considering schwinger pair production in this context .",
    "furthermore , pairs can also be created by gravitational fields , e.g. , in ds @xcite and quasi - ds @xcite , which is sometimes referred to as the cosmological schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "these effects can also be essential for the interaction and balance between matter - field and cosmological constant in the universe evolution @xcite .",
    "recently , the combination of electrical and gravitational pair creation was studied in depth for various types of particles and spacetime dimension @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the authors computed the schwinger effect for a charged scalar test field in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . in @xcite and @xcite , the generalization to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , for fermionic particles was performed aiming at checking if the known equivalence in flat spacetime between boson and fermion for a constant electric field still holds .",
    "the answer was that there was a difference between boson and fermion . to see that , it was necessary to compute the induced current which turns out , as also noted in @xcite , to be the right quantity to describe the schwinger effect in curved spacetime .",
    "indeed , it is not plagued by the need of the notion of particle in the adiabatic future which allows one to explore a broader parameter space .",
    "but to cure infinities arising from momentum integration , this current needs to be renormalized .",
    "the adiabatic subtraction is the most used method .",
    "the pauli - villars method was implemented in @xcite and can be shown to agree with the adiabatic subtraction . in @xcite , the point - splitting method was shown to agree with the adiabatic subtraction in @xmath10 for the boson . in @xcite , an adiabatic subtraction method was used to regularize the current . to further explore the validity of the use of the adiabatic subtraction ,",
    "it is legitimate to look at @xmath11 and see which kinds of divergences arise and how they are cured .    in @xcite ,",
    "the schwinger effect in @xmath11 has been investigated as an example of odd dimensional ds , and it has been shown that no particle production occurs in odd dimensional global ds . however , in our study on the poincar patch together with an electric field , we report particle production .",
    "one more motivation to look in depth at an odd dimensional quantum field theory is that those theories sometimes exhibit strange behaviors .",
    "for instance , dimensional regularization shows no one - loop ultraviolet divergences because it only registers logarithmic divergences and all the divergences are power law in an odd dimension . for @xmath2 in curved spacetime with an electric field ,",
    "we will , however , report a linear divergence arising from the electromagnetic side of the theory .",
    "regarding infrared phenomena , we will also report a different behavior than in an even dimension which is also the case in flat spacetime .",
    "our work aims at completing the picture of the schwinger effect in @xmath11 by computing the induced current .",
    "all the works so far describing pair creation in @xmath12 under the influence of a strong electric field @xcite assumed two backgrounds , i.e. , electromagnetic and gravitational . in @xcite and @xcite , the backreaction effects due to the created schwinger pairs on the electromagnetic field background have been investigated , while in this case , there is no report on the backreaction to the gravity sector . in order to investigate the backreaction to the gravitational background",
    "one needs the energy - momentum tensor of the created particles . in the absence of the electromagnetic background , i.e. , in the presence of a purely gravitational field ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the created scalar @xcite and fermion @xcite particles in a spatially flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker universe ( considering @xmath10 as a special case ) have been computed . in @xcite ,",
    "the author examined backreaction to the gravitational field and found that the particle creation leads to a decrease of the cosmological constant , whereas in @xcite , the authors mainly developed the renormalization theory . in the last part of this article , we will present some preliminary results on backreaction to the gravitational field , namely , an estimate of the variation of the hubble constant due to the influence of the gravitational field .",
    "we hope to come back to this issue in the future by solving fully the einstein equation .",

    "however , the one loop integration depends on @xmath108 , and hence the prefactor to the classical trajectory is a function @xmath108 . before concluding",
    ", we should remark that under the semiclassical condition  ( [ assume ] ) the result  ( [ rate ] ) obtained using standard methods reduced to the semiclassical result  ( [ smifinal ] ) .",
    "therefore , the flat spacetime limit of the semiclassical pair creation rate  ( [ smifinal ] ) is equal to the result presented in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) .",
    "in this appendix , we have represented some useful relations and properties of mathematical functions needed in this article .",
    "more relations can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the whittaker differential equation is @xmath334 it has the two linearly independent solutions , namely , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the needed connection formulas are @xmath335 the asymptotical expansion of the whittaker functions as @xmath63 are given by @xmath336 where @xmath337 is an arbitrary small positive constant . in the limit @xmath338 , the asymptotically expansions are given by @xmath339 finally , some useful wronskians are @xmath340      the modified bessel function has integral representation along the real line @xmath341 if @xmath154 is an integer , then @xmath342 when @xmath343 is fixed and @xmath248 , @xmath344 when @xmath343 is fixed and @xmath345 , @xmath346 in the cases @xmath347 and @xmath348 , the relations @xmath349 are satisfied .",
    "the following mathematical formulas can be shown : @xmath350      in order to evaluate the integrals  ( [ intk ] ) and  ( [ semidif ] ) , we make use of the spherical coordinates to decompose the momentum vector @xmath105 in the flat @xmath108-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "hence , in this space the volume element is @xmath351 where @xmath246 is the area element of the unit sphere in the @xmath108-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "convenient coordinates on this sphere are specified by @xmath352 where @xmath353 for @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "then , the metric on the sphere is @xmath356 and consequently , the area element is @xmath357 therefore the area of the sphere is @xmath358 using eqs .",
    "( [ bessel ] ) , ( [ formul ] ) , ( [ aelement ] ) , and  ( [ area ] ) the following formula can be shown : @xmath359",
    "in this appendix , the computation of the current integral  ( [ curent ] ) is reviewed .",
    "we follow the same integration procedure as performed in @xcite for a one - dimensional and @xcite for a three - dimensional momentum integral .",
    "we deal with the following integral : @xmath360 we will use the mellin - barnes representation of the whittaker function @xmath361 where the contour of integration separates the poles of @xmath362 from those of @xmath363 @xcite . based on the definition  ( [ gamma ] )",
    ", it depends on the range of the involved parameters whether @xmath47 is real or purely imaginary",
    ". however , by virtue of the relation  ( [ conectionw ] ) , in the integral  ( [ integral ] ) we have @xmath364 .",
    "then , the integral  ( [ integral ] ) can be rewritten @xmath365 where @xmath366 is defined as @xmath367 if we choose both @xmath368 and @xmath15 integration contours to run in a similar way as ref .",
    "@xcite , then we obtain the final result @xmath369 where @xmath183 is given by eq .",
