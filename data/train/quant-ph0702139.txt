    "squeezed states can be important resources for quantum information processing with continuous variables@xcite .",
    "for example , quadrature squeezed vacuum states are used to realize quantum teleportation@xcite which is one of the most important protocols in quantum information processing .",
    "the squeezing level limits the fidelity of teleportation@xcite .",
    "hence it is important to improve the squeezing level to achieve higher fidelity .",
    "a quadrature squeezed vacuum state of continuous - wave ( cw ) light is often generated by utilizing a subthreshold optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , and a periodically poled ktiopo@xmath1(ppktp ) crystal is being used as a nonlinear optical medium in the opo@xcite . of squeezing at 860",
    "nm has been reported by suzuki et al.@xcite using a ppktp crystal . as is indicated in this reference ,",
    "one is required to suppress fluctuation of relative phase between squeezed light and a local oscillator ( lo ) beam in homodyne measurement and to reduce intracavity losses of the opo in order to observe higher level of squeezing .",
    "therefore we have focused on suppression of the phase fluctuation and reduction of the intracavity losses to improve the observed squeezing level .",

    "fig.[fig : exp ] shows a schematic of our experimental setup .",
    "a quadrature squeezed vacuum state is generated from a subthreshold opo which is pumped by a second harmonic light generated with doubling of an output of a cw ti : sapphire laser ( coherent , mbr110 ) at 860  nm .",
    "a cavity of the opo has a bow - tie - type ring configuration consisting of two spherical mirrors ( radius of curvature of 50  mm ) and two flat mirrors .",
    "one of the two flat mirrors is an output coupler and the transmittance is @xmath4 .",
    "the round trip length is about 500  mm . a 10-mm - long ppktp crystal ( raicol crystals )",
    "is placed between the two spherical mirrors .",
    "the ppktp crystal is specially antireflecting - coated to reduce the intracavity losses as much as possible .",
    "the beam waist size inside the crystal is about 20  @xmath5 m .",
    "squeezed light from the opo is measured by a balanced homodyne detector and the output electric signal is analyzed by a spectrum analyzer ( agilent , e4402b ) .",
    "the homodyne detector consists of two si photodiodes ( hamamatsu , s3590 - 06 with antirefrection coating ) and a subtraction circuit . at the homodyne detection ,",
    "we need to lock the relative phase between the squeezed light and the lo beam in order to measure the squeezed or antisqueezed quadrature . to realized this phase locking",
    ", we use a phase - modulated weak coherent beam , which is called a  probe \" beam , and the phase modulation is applied to it by a function generator ( fg ) and a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt2 ) . at first , we lock a relative phase between the pump beam and the probe beam by monitoring the intensity of the transmitted probe beam from the opo with a photo detector ( pd ) to make the probe beam intensity minimum or maximum by controlling the pzt1 , i.e. , the parametric gain is locked at the most de - amplified phase or the most amplified phase .",
    "then , we lock a relative phase between the lo beam and the probe beam by using the output signal of the homodyne detector to get an error signal for controlling the pzt3 . as a result of these two phase locking , the relative phase between the lo beam and the squeezed light is locked so that we can measure the squeezed or antisqueezed quadrature .",
    "the relative phase is fluctuating even if it is locked .",
    "because of the finite phase fluctuation , the antisqueezed quadrature contaminates the observed squeezing level . in order to observe high level of squeezing ,",
    "it is essentially required to suppress the phase fluctuation .",
    "taking account of the phase fluctuation with an rms of @xmath6 , the observed squeezing level @xmath7 and antisqueezing level @xmath8 are calculated as follows@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is generated squeezing / antisqueezing levels without taking account of the phase fluctuation , @xmath11 is quantum efficiency of the photodiode , @xmath12 is homodyne visibility , @xmath13 is propagation efficiency , @xmath14 is escape efficiency of the cavity , @xmath15 is transmittance of the output coupler , @xmath16 is the intracavity losses , @xmath17 is normalized pump power , @xmath18 is pump power , @xmath19 is an oscillation threshold of the opo , @xmath20 is normalized frequency , @xmath21 is measurement frequency by a spectrum analyzer , @xmath22 is the opo cavity decay rate , and @xmath23 is round trip length of the cavity .",
    "one of the main factors we need to improve is the phase fluctuation . in the reference @xcite , the phase fluctuation @xmath6 was 3.9@xmath24 , which limits the observed squeezing level to -8.66  db even in an ideal , lossless condition . to reduce the phase fluctuation ,",
    "we have improved our feedback system , especially the following two points : resonant frequency of the feedback system , and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the error signals .    to make the resonant frequency of the feedback system higher ,",
    "we have replaced pzts from single - layer ones to stuck ones ( thorlabs , ae0203d04 ) . generally speaking , a stuck pzt has larger capacitance than a single - layer one so that it seems that the feedback system has lower resonant frequency with a stuck pzt .",
    "but resonance of the feedback system in fact occurs at an eigen frequency of a complex consisting of a pzt , a mirror , and a mount , and the eigen frequency of the system is lower than the frequency derived from only an effect of the capacitance . in our case ,",
    "the resonant frequency was about 2  khz with single - layer pzts , and with the present setup the resonance occurs at 14  khz at pzt1 for parametric gain locking and at 22  khz at pzt3 for lo phase locking , respectively .",
    "note that the difference between these two resonant frequencies would be caused by individualities of the pzts . as a result of the higher resonant frequencies",
    ", we can apply larger feedback gain to low frequency domain to stabilize the phase locking .    to increase snr of the error signals",
    ", we have optimized modulation frequency , modulation depth , and probe beam power",
    ". the modulation frequency should be sufficiently high not to be affected by original laser noise around 89  khz and 177  khz .",
    "thus we have set it 295  khz because the laser noise can be considered at the shot noise level and the pzt2 resonates at this frequency . the modulation depth and",
    "the probe beam power should be large enough to obtain clear error signals , but they can affect homodyne measurement harmfully .",
    "we have optimized them and checked that the shot noise level was not affected by the modulation at the measurement frequency .",
    "thanks to these improvements , the phase fluctuation is suppressed to 1.5@xmath24 , with which the highest squeezing level is supposed to be -12.81  db in an ideal , lossless condition of the present experimental setup .    another main factor which degrades the observed squeezing level is the intracavity losses . in the reference @xcite ,",
    "intracavity losses were @xmath25 which stayed constant independently of the pump beam power , that is , blue light induced infrared absorption ( bliira)@xcite or other pump light induced losses were not observed . to reduce the intracavity losses as much as possible , we use a specially antireflecting - coated ppktp crystal . with the crystal ,",
    "the intracavity losses are reduced to @xmath26 without a pump beam and @xmath27 with a pump beam at the power of 100  mw .",
    "therefore the escape efficiency @xmath14 is improved from 0.95 to 0.97 under 100  mw pumping .",
    "note that small pump light induced losses are observed with the new crystal , and the induced losses increase as the pump beam power increases .",
    "moreover , if we make the wavelength of the output beam of the ti : sa laser slightly shorter ( @xmath28 - 1  nm ) , the intracavity losses become to grow gradually in time ( the intracavity losses increased to more than 0.0073 at 2000 seconds after 100  mw pump beam was injected ) .",
    "this phenomenon depends strongly on the wavelength so that we have chosen better wavelength without the effect .",
    "0.14/+15.12@xmath00.14  db , respectively . ]",
    "fig.[fig : sq ] shows the observed noise levels at the pump power of 100  mw .",
    "all traces are measured by a spectrum analyzer with the following conditions : measurement frequency is 1  mhz in a zero span mode , resolution bandwidth is 30  khz , and video bandwidth is 300  hz .",
    "the trace ( i ) is the shot noise level , ( ii ) a noise level with the lo phase locked at the squeezed quadrature , ( iii ) locked at the antisqueezed quadrature , and ( iv ) a noise level with the lo phase scanned .",
    "these traces except for ( iv ) are averaged for 20 times .",
    "the observed squeezing level is -9.01@xmath00.14  db and the antisqueezing level is + 15.12@xmath00.14  db .    in this measurement ,",
    "the intracavity losses are @xmath27 with 100  mw pump beam , the parametric gain ( amplification factor ) @xmath29 , propagation efficiency @xmath30 , the phase fluctuation @xmath31 , the homodyne visibility @xmath32 , photodiodes quantum efficiency @xmath33 , and the detector circuit noise level is -21.7  db compared to the shot noise level at the lo power of 5.5  mw . subtracting the detector circuit noise ,",
    "the squeezing / antisqueezing levels @xmath34 are -9.22@xmath00.15/+15.15@xmath00.14  db , respectively .",
    "considering eq.([eq : pf ] ) , the generated squeezing / antisqueezing levels @xmath10 are estimated as -10.12@xmath00.18/+15.15@xmath00.14  db , respectively . here",

    "the solid curves are calculated with @xmath31 , and the dotted with 3.9@xmath24@xcite .",
    "the horizontal axis represents normalized pump power @xmath17 which is more convenient than pump power @xmath18 because the subthreshold condition is satisfied within the range of @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 .",
    "the measurements are performed at the pump power of 10 , 20 , 50 , 65 , 90 , 100 , 120 , 130 , and 150  mw . to calculate the normalized pump powers from these  raw \" pump powers , we derive oscillation threshold @xmath19 of the opo by the following relations@xcite : @xmath41 by using these equations ,",

    "the theoretically calculated values show good agreement with the experimental results , which suggests that eq.([eq : pf ] ) is a proper model of degradation of squeezing caused by phase fluctuation .",
    "one can see that the observed squeezing level degrades above @xmath44 since the large antisqueezed quadrature contaminates the observed ( squeezed ) quadrature due to the finite phase fluctuation so that there exists optimal normalized pump power @xmath45 to observe the highest squeezing level . of course the optimal power @xmath45 increases as the phase fluctuation @xmath6 is suppressed .",
