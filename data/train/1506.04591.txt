    "in inverse spectral problems one tries to recover geometric ( or `` classical '' ) information from the spectrum of a `` quantum '' operator .",
    "for instance , does the spectrum of the laplacian on a bounded euclidean domain completely determine the geometry of the domain ?",
    "the problem goes back to s. bochner and h. weyl @xcite in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , and was made popular , in the context of riemannian geometry , in m. kac s famous article on  can you hear the shape of a drum \" , @xcite , who attributes the origin of the question to bochner .    in this paper we will deal with a quite general setting of semiclassical self - adjoint operators . roughly speaking",
    ", a quantum operator will be a family of operators @xmath1 depending on a small real parameter @xmath2 reminiscent of the planck constant .",
    "to each such operator , one defines its `` classical limit '' to be a smooth function on a smooth manifold ( the phase space ) , called the _ principal symbol _ of the operator .",
    "the semiclassical inverse problem is then the following .    *",
    "( semiclassical inverse spectral problem ) * [ q1 ] given the semiclassical joint spectrum @xmath3 of a quantum system of commuting semiclassical operators @xmath4 how much can one recover about the classical system given by the principal symbols @xmath5 of @xmath6 ?",
    "of course , a complete answer to this question would be to fully recover the principal symbols @xmath5 themselves .",
    "one can hope to obtain such general results by combining the use of microlocal and symplectic techniques in the spirit of duistermaat , helffer , hrmander , sjstrand , etc .",
    "however , to date only a handful of results are known in this direction , see  @xcite . if one restricts the class of operators to be schrdinger operators , whose principal symbol is of the form @xmath7 , then the question amounts to recovering the potential @xmath8 ; this has attracted a lot of mathematicians , and is still an active area of research , see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we prove a general result giving a partial answer to question  [ q1 ] , inspired by previous works of colin de verdiere  @xcite , polterovich , and the authors  @xcite , which says that even though we do not know how to recover the principal symbols themselves , we can recover the closure of their joint image , which is a subset of the affine space @xmath9 .",
    "this gives a rigorous proof of the quantum mechanical principle that says that :  in the high frequency limit @xmath10 , the spectrum of a quantum system converges to the numerical range of its associated classical system \" .",

    "we achieve this improvement by introducing a new hypothesis , which takes the form of the following seemingly simple axiom for the abstract semiclassical quantization : for any symbol @xmath17 , one should have @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the quantization operation .",
    "we refer to theorem  [ theo : main ] for a detailed version of the above statement , to definition  [ bt ] for the abstract notion of semiclassical operators we use , and the upcoming sections for the necessary preliminaries .",
    "the abstract notion we use , and hence the theorem , apply to berezin - toeplitz operators on compact manifolds , and certain classes of pseuodifferential operators ( this is explained in remark  [ importantremark ] ) , for instance those with uniformly bounded derivatives .    as we will explain , theorem  [ theo : main ] implies , in combination with a theorem of atiyah - guillemin - sternberg and delzant , a solution to the inverse problem for quantum toric integrable systems , which recovers a recent result of charles and the authors  @xcite .",
    "this result was proved again shortly after by polterovich and the authors  @xcite with a different method , which is in fact the one which serves as inspiration for theorem  [ theo : main ] , in combination with ideas introduced by le floch and the authors in  @xcite .",
    "we review berezin - toeplitz quantization , @xmath0-pseudodifferential quantization , and then introduce an abstract notion of semiclassical quantization which includes the former , and certain classes of the latter .",
    "this abstract notion is inspired by , and extends , a notion introduced by polterovich and the authors  @xcite and as we will see in section  [ ip ] it allows us to prove a stronger convergence result in certain cases .      the microlocal analysis of toeplitz operators is rapidly evolving nowadays ,",

    "the global classification of toric integrable systems of atiyah , guillemin - sternberg , and delzant opened up the doors and served as inspiration to many authors working on global symplectic invariants of integrable systems .",
    "our next goal is to define toric integrable systems , and the natural transformations between them , and state the classification in the work of atiyah , guillemin - sternberg and delzant .",
    "let @xmath50 be a @xmath238-dimensional symplectic manifold .",
    "a smooth map @xmath251 on @xmath50 is a _ momentum map _ for a hamiltonian @xmath93-torus action if each of the hamiltonian flows @xmath252 of the vector fields @xmath243 is periodic of period 1 , and all of them pairwise commute , that is , @xmath253 so that they define an action of the torus @xmath254 .",
    "atiyah and guillemin - sternberg proved the following influential result ( in fact their result applied to much more general momentum maps given by an @xmath259-tuple on a @xmath238-manifold , where @xmath93 is not necessarily equal to @xmath259 and the induced toral action is not necessarily effective ) :      the set of fixed point ( also called elliptic points ) of the induced @xmath254-action is a collection of symplectic submanifolds of @xmath20 , and its image under @xmath55 gives a finite collection of points @xmath262 the convex polytope in theorem  [ cos ] is precisely the set @xmath263 shortly after atiyah and guillemin - sternberg proved their theorem , delzant proved a converse type result , hence giving a classification of toric systems .",
    "it is known that not every symplectic manifold has a complex structure or a prequantum line bundle . in the case of toric integrable systems",
    ", the situation is better .",
    "a toric integrable system does admit a compatible complex structure , which is however not unique .",
    "suppose that @xmath269 is the momentum map and let @xmath270 be its image in @xmath177 , which is a convex polytope ( by theorem  [ cos ] ) , say with vertices @xmath271 then the system is is prequantizable if and only if there is a constant @xmath272 such that @xmath273 if this holds , the prequantum line bundle is in fact is unique , up to isomorphisms .",
    "* the set @xmath276 is the convex polytope @xmath260 in the atiyah - guillemin - sternberg theorem ( theorem  [ cos ] ) ; * the point @xmath277 is any vertex of @xmath278 ; * @xmath279 admits a @xmath75-asymptotic expansion @xmath280 where each @xmath281 is a smooth function .",
    "moreover , if the spectral parameter @xmath63 is large enough then the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of @xmath282 is precisely equal to @xmath25 , and and there is @xmath283 such that if @xmath284 is an eigenvalue then the ball @xmath285 centered at @xmath284 or radius @xmath286 contains precisely only the eigenvalue @xmath284 .",
    "[ nice ] let @xmath274 be a quantum toric system on a closed manifold @xmath20 .",
    "then the joint spectrum of @xmath268 modulo @xmath287 determines the classical integrable system given by principal symbols , up to isomorphisms .",
    "a quicker alternative proof of corollary  [ nice ] was given in @xcite , and it also follows ( in the same way as therein ) from theorem  [ theo : main ] . indeed , theorem  [ theo : main ] implies that from the joint spectrum one can recover @xmath228 .",
    "but we know that @xmath288 is the delzant polytope of the system .",
    "since , by delzant s theorem  [ del ] , the polytope is enough to reconstruct the manifold and the moment map @xmath55 , it follows that the joint spectrum completely determines the classical system .",
    "[ above ] there exists a quantization of any classical toric integrable system .",
