    "theoretically , future quantum computers can simulate physical systems and solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers @xcite .",
    "this possibility has excited several researchers to strive for experimental realization of quantum computers . apart from trapped ions and cavity - qed systems , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )",
    "has proved as a suitable physical system for quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , nmr has emerged as the most successful of all systems , demonstrating several quantum algorithms including shor s factorization algorithm @xcite . however , scalability is one of the hurdles that nmr - qip faces today .",
    "originally it was conceived that liquid - state nmr will use as qubits , spin-1/2 nuclei having different larmor frequencies and weakly coupled to each other by indirect j - couplings @xcite .",
    "since j - couplings mediate through covalent bonds , they become vanishingly small beyond 4 - 5 bonds .",
    "such systems are thus difficult to scale beyond 7 - 8 qubits .",
    "attempts are going on to explore other couplings such as the direct dipolar couplings between spin-1/2 nuclei , which are larger in magnitude , depend on the inter - nuclear distances , and not on the number of intermediate covalent bonds .",
    "however , in liquids , molecules undergo fast isotropic reorientations , thereby averaging out all dipolar interactions ( homonuclear , heteronuclear , intermolecular and intra molecular ) . in solids , the molecules",
    "are static , and all the dipolar interactions are retained yielding broad spectra , rendering such systems unsuitable for quantum information processing",
    ". however , when molecules are dissolved in liquid crystal solvents , they have sufficient translational motion but get partially oriented and have anisotropic rotational motion . in such cases , while the intermolecular dipolar interactions are averaged to zero , the intra - molecular dipolar interactions survive which are scaled down from several khz to a few khz .",
    "such systems yield well resolved spectra with finite number of sharp lines @xcite . in such cases",
    "the spins have considerable dipolar couplings and it has been demonstrated that they can be used for quantum information processing @xcite .    however , in cases where the differences in larmor frequencies or chemical shifts are not large compared to the dipolar couplings , the spins become strongly coupled . the eigenstates of the system",
    "are not products of the eigen - states of various spins but linear combinations of the product states , and spins can no longer be identified as a qubits @xcite .",
    "still , it has been demonstrated that the @xmath0 energy levels of the n spin-1/2 system can be treated as @xmath0 states of a n - qubit system , and , can be used for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "quantum information processing has already been demonstrated in homonuclear 2,3 and 4-spin systems oriented in liquid crystal matrices @xcite . in the homonuclear systems , it was found that if the spins are in symmetric chemical environment , the eigenstates break up into symmetry groups , leading to reduced number of qubits and other complications with degenerate transitions from different symmetry manifolds @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable that the homonuclear spins are in non - symmetric chemical environment .",
    "furthermore , it is advantageous to include heteronuclear spins in the system . here , we extend our earlier work by including a heteronuclear spin with four homonuclear spins in non - equivalent chemical environment , all dipolar coupled to each other .",
    "we use the molecule 1-chloro,2-flouro benzene ( dissolved in liquid crystal solvent zli-1132 ) , which yields a 5-qubit system in which the four protons are strongly coupled to each other but weakly coupled to the fluorine .",
    "the hamiltonian for the dipolar interaction among the strongly coupled protons @xmath1 is , @xmath2 where @xmath3=@xmath4 is the scaled dipolar interaction , scaled by the order parameter @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for dipolar interaction between the protons and the fluorine(*s * ) is    @xmath6    the full hamiltonian of the system including zeeman , dipolar and j - coupling terms , is given by : @xmath7    the equilibrium spectrum of the protons and the fluorine is given in fig .",
    "1 . in order to use this spin system for qip , one needs to identify the energy levels of the system and to assign each transition to a pair of these levels .",
    "there are two possible methods .",
    "one well - known method is to numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian of the system , with some initially guessed parameters ( chemical shifts , dipolar and j - couplings ) and iteratively fit the calculated and observed spectra @xcite .",
    "the second method is the use of z - cosy two - dimensional ( 2d ) experiment which identifies connected transitions and draws automatically the energy - level diagram @xcite .",
    "so far z - cosy has been used only for homonuclear spins .",
    "this paper consists of two parts . in the first part ( section ii )",
    "we introduce a heteronuclear z - cosy experiment and utilize it to obtain the complete energy level diagram of this dipolar coupled 5 spin system . in the second part ( section iii ) , we demonstrate that this spin system can be used as a 5-qubit system by preparing pseudopure states , performing c@xmath8-not operations and controlled swap operations , and creating and transferring entanglement using transition selective pulses .",
    "the pulse sequence of a z - cosy experiment is @xmath9 , where only the longitudinal magnetization is retained during the interval @xmath10 by either phase cycling or by a gradient pulse @xcite .",
    "the 90@xmath11 pulse converts the equilibrium z - magnetization into coherences , which are frequency labeled during the period @xmath12 .",
    "the small angle @xmath13 pulse ensures that each cross - section parallel to @xmath14 from the resulting 2d spectrum is equivalent to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) experiment in which the peak corresponding to the diagonal is selectively inverted .",
    "the directly connected transitions to the inverted transition are finally measured in the linear regime by a small angle @xmath15 pulse .",
    "the z - cosy experiment has been successfully used to construct the energy level diagram in oriented homonuclear spin systems @xcite . here",
    "the z - cosy experiment is extended to include a heteronucleus and we call this experiment as het - z - cosy .    for  n \" heteronuclear systems het - z - cosy",
    "experiment requires  n \" 2d experiments where each experiment observes one of the heteronucleus during @xmath16 .",
    "the pulse sequence for het - z - cosy experiment is @xmath17 , where the @xmath18 and @xmath13 pulses are applied on all the nuclei , and @xmath15 is applied only on the observed nucleus . in the present case , two experiments have to be performed for detecting protons and fluorine respectively .",
    "gz is the gradient pulse which retains only the the longitudinal magnetization . besides creating multi - spin zz terms @xcite",
    ", the @xmath13-pulse creates all coherences including zero - quantum coherences .",
    "the gradient pulse destroys all other coherences as desired , except the homonuclear zero - quantum coherences .",
    "these zero - quantum coherences get partially converted into single quantum coherences by the last @xmath15 pulse causing the well known zero - quantum interference in the 2d spectroscopy . to avoid this",
    "we have used the method of zero - quantum shifting @xcite by incrementing the @xmath10 delay as ( gz+kt@xmath19 ) , where k=2 was used .",
    "this shifts the zero - quantum peaks in the @xmath20 dimension which are eventually removed by symmetrizing the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the 2d spectrum of het - z - cosy on the systems of oriented 1-chloro 2-flouro benzene is shown in fig .",
    "the experimental spectrum when protons are observed in @xmath16 , is given on the left side ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) , while the experimental spectrum when fluorine is observed is given on the right side ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the spectrum in figure 2(a ) has the diagonal and connectivity information between the proton transitions , while figure 2(c ) has the connectivity information of the fluorine transitions to the proton transitions .",
    "figure 2(b ) has the diagonal and connectivity information between the fluorine transitions , and figure 2(d ) has the connectivity information of the proton transitions to the fluorine transitions .",
    "every connectivity is mutual such that if transition @xmath21 is progressively connected to transition @xmath22 , then transition @xmath22 is also progressively connected to transition @xmath21 . hence the cross peaks should be symmetric about the diagonal @xcite . the symmetrized spectrum ( free of zero - quantum and other artifacts ) is given in fig .",
    "a connectivity matrix is constructed from the symmetric 2d spectrum , by taking cross - sections parallel to @xmath14 at each transition along @xmath20 . from this connectivity matrix",
    "the complete energy - level diagram can be constructed following the method given in reference 32 @xcite .",
    "the complete energy level diagram constructed by the above procedure is given in fig .",
    "4 . all the steps including construction of the juxtaposed 2d spectrum , symmetrization , construction of the connectivity matrix and the construction of the complete energy - level diagram are automated by a program written in matlab @xcite .    in this 5-spin system , there are @xmath23 energy levels .",
    "the proton transitions connect energy levels within two separate domains ( a and b ) of 16 energy levels each , corresponding respectively to + 1/2 and -1/2 states of the fluorine spin ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the fluorine transitions connect the levels from a domain to the b domain .",
    "the various transitions observed in the spectrum are given serial numbers ( 1 - 60 for proton and 61 - 82 for the fluorine transitions ) .",
    "except the four extreme eigenstates all others are linear combinations of the product states of the 4 protons .",
    "the extreme eigenstates are 1a , 16a , 1b and 16b respectively corresponding to the eigenstates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the first state corresponds to the fluorine spin and last four to the protons .",
    "fig . 5 shows the labeling of the various eigenstates of the 5-spin system to 5-qubit labels .",
    "while labels can be chosen for optimum execution of various logical operations , here we have retained a conventional labeling @xcite .",
    "transition selective @xmath28-pulse has a narrow bandwidth and when tuned to the resonance frequency of a specific transition in the spectrum , it exchanges the amplitudes of the two eigen - states which are connected by that transition @xcite .",
    "such pulses have already been used to simplify the implementation of several logical operations for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "pseudopure states ( pps ) are the staring point for implementation of various quantum algorithms by nmr . in a pps ,",
    "populations of all the states except one are equalized @xcite . among the various methods of creating pps ,",
    "we have implemented the method of pair of pseudopure states ( pops ) , originally suggested by fung et.al @xcite .",
    "pops requires two experiments : ( i ) equilibrium and ( ii ) a selective population inversion .",
    "subtraction of these two population distributions yields zero populations for all the levels except the inverted pair , which in turn has equal positive / negative populations .",
    "this acts as a pair of pseudopure states .",
    "it has been demonstrated elsewhere , that for implementation of certain algorithms , pops is sufficient to begin with @xcite .",
    "moreover , in an n - qubit system , pops can also act as a ( n-1)-qubit sub - system pps .",
    "here we have chosen to apply @xmath28 pulse on the fluorine transition 61 which connect @xmath29 .",
    "after the @xmath30 pulse , a gradient pulse is applied to kill any unwanted coherence created by the imperfection of the r.f .",
    "the final populations are measured by a small angle ( @xmath31 ) proton and fluorine pulses , which convert within linear approximation , population differences into observable single quantum intensities .",
    "the resulting spectrum is given in figure 6(b ) .",
    "subtraction of equilibrium populations ( figure 6(a ) ) from that corresponding to figure 6(b ) yields the pair of pseudopure states @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting spectrum is given in figure 6(c ) .",
    "note that the transitions 2 , 18 , 21 and 37 are of opposite sign to that of 61 , as they are progressively connected to 61 ( see figure 5 ) and transitions 1 and 9 are of the same sign since that they are regressively connected to 61 .",
    "the spectrum obtained after pops contains only transitions originating from the two levels having non - zero populations .",
    "this effectively gives the various transitions connected to these levels .",
    "the same information is also available in the cross - sections of het - z - cosy spectrum at the frequency of transition connecting the two levels .",
    "a cross - section parallel to @xmath14 at the @xmath20-frequency of transition 61 from spectrum of figure 2 is given in figure 6(c ) .",
    "a good match of relative intensities of various transitions within each spectrum of 6(c ) and 6(c ) confirms the creation of pops in 6(c ) .",
    "it may be noted that , while 6(c ) is achieved with a selective inversion of transition 61 , 6(c ) is a cross - section of a 2d spectrum obtained using non - selective low angle pulses assuming perturbation and observation in the linear regime .",
    "another method of creating sub - system pseudopure state is ; spatially averaged logical labeling technique ( sallt ) @xcite .",
    "a hard @xmath33 pulse on the protons equalize the populations within each subsystem [ a and b ] , with the value differing between the two subsystems . a gradient pulses is subsequently applied to kill the coherences created in the process .",
    "a transition selective pulse @xmath28 on one of the fluorine transitions ( we have chosen transition 61 ) then creates subsystem pseudopure states .",
    "the populations corresponding to this state are measured by a small angle ( @xmath31 ) pulse and the resulting spectrum , is given in figure 6(d ) .",
    "the proton spectra of figure 6(c ) and 6(d ) are nearly identical , confirming the creation of subsystem pps .",
    "the populations of pops and sallt differ in the sense that pops yields zero populations of all levels except one in each subsystem , while sallt has equal population of all levels ( not necessarily zero ) except one in each subsystem .",
    "the fluorine spectrum in figure 6(d ) is therefore identical to the spectrum in figure 6(b ) .",
    "controlled - not gates are essential parts of any computation .",
    "a c@xmath34-not gate will change the state of fifth qubit when the other four qubits are in the state @xmath35 .",
    "proton transition 60 connects the states @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "hence a @xmath38 pulse performs c@xmath34-not operation .",
    "we start from equilibrium state and implement the c@xmath34-not gate .",
    "a subsequent gradient pulse kills any coherences created by imperfection of the r.f pulse .",
    "the output of the gate is stored in the final populations .",
    "the final populations , measured by small - angle @xmath39 proton and fluorine pulses after implementing c@xmath34-not gate corresponding to @xmath40 , yield the spectrum given in figure 7(b ) .",
    "another pops can be created by subtraction of this population distribution and the equilibrium populations .",
    "subtraction of figure 7(a ) from 7(b ) yields the pops of @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding spectrum is given in figure 7(c ) .",
    "creation of the pops can also be confirmed by cross - sections parallel to @xmath14 of figure 2 at the @xmath20-frequency of the transition 60 , given in 7(c )",
    ".    controlled swap gates are becoming increasingly popular in quantum information processing @xcite . a c@xmath42-swap gate swaps the state of last two qubits when the first three qubits are in the state @xmath35 . essentially , this gate interchanges the amplitudes between @xmath36 and @xmath43 .",
    "a sequence of three pulses @xmath44-@xmath45-@xmath44 achieves this gate .",
    "we start from the pops of @xmath46 prepared by subtraction of the equilibrium populations from the populations obtained by inversion of the proton transition 55 ( figure 7(d ) ) .",
    "the creation of this pops is confirmed by the cross - section of figure 2 at the frequency of 55 , given in figure ( d ) .",
    "the subsequent implementation of c@xmath42-swap gate [ @xmath44-@xmath45-@xmath44 ] interchanges the populations between @xmath36 and @xmath43 .",
    "a gradient pulse is applied after each @xmath28-pulse to destroy any coherences created by imperfection of pulses .",
    "the final state is the pops of @xmath41 , and the resulting proton and fluorinne spectra measured by a small angle ( @xmath31 ) pulses is given in figure 7(e ) .",
    "a good match between 7(e ) and 7(c ) confirms the implementation of c@xmath42-swap gate .",
    "entanglement is a remarkable property of quantum systems , which has no classical analogue .",
    "entanglement is also a key requirement for many quantum information processing protocols .",
    "many of these protocols require transfer of entanglement between qubits .",
    "entanglement transfer has become specially useful in the cases where one needs to transfer data to the quantum memory ( qubits with less decoherence that are used for storing data ) from the fast processor ( qubits have decoherence but can perform universal logic operations ) in a manner similar to the protocol proposed by chuang et.al .",
    "entanglement transfer has been demonstrated previously by cory et.al . in liquid state nmr of",
    "weakly coupled 4-qubit spin-1/2 system @xcite . here , we demonstrate entanglement transfer in this strongly coupled system by using the last 4-qubits of the 5-qubit system with the first qubit acting as an ancillary bit .",
    "we start by preparing the 4-qubit subsystem pseudopure state by sallt ( figure 6(d ) ) .",
    "we chose to perform further operations in only one of the subsystems ( where 1st qubit is in state @xmath48 ) [ domain b ] .",
    "hence , in the next paragraph , only the states of the last four qubits are given , but they are to be understood as the states with first qubit being @xmath48",
    ".    starting from the @xmath49 pseudopure state , uniform superposition of 2nd qubit was created by a @xmath50 pulse : @xmath51 ( fig 5(a ) , b domain ) .",
    "the states were tomographed using two - dimensional fourier transform technique @xcite .",
    "2d spectra for measurement of all off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are given in figure 8 .",
    "figure 8(a ) contains the totality of the multiple quantum ( mq ) spectrum of the four protons obtained by a @xmath52 pulse sequence starting from equilibrium population distribution .",
    "figure 8(b ) on the other hand contains the mq spectrum starting from the state of @xmath53 and shows the presence of a single quantum coherence of this state at frequency of transition 2 ( @xmath54 ) along @xmath20 . a controlled not gate between 2nd and 3rd qubit is implemented by a @xmath55 pulse .",
    "this gate changes the state of third qubit when the second qubit is in state @xmath35 and creates an entangled epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen @xcite ) pair between the 2nd and 3rd qubit given by : @xmath56 .",
    "the presence of the double quantum coherence with frequency @xmath57 along @xmath20 in the 2d spectrum for tomography of all off - diagonal elements in figure 8(c ) and the absence of all other coherences , indicates the creation of the epr coherence .",
    "the tomographed density matrix of the b domain , given in figure 8(d ) , confirm creation of the epr state . a sequence of three transition selective pulses @xmath58 swaps the states of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , thereby transferring the entanglement to the first and fourth qubit : @xmath61 .",
    "hence the entanglement initially created between the second and third qubit is now transfered to the first and fourth qubit , while the second and third qubit are in the @xmath62 state and can be used for further computation .",
    "all the pulses and the receiver were phase cycled by a standard cyclops phase cycle @xcite .",
    "the presence of the double quantum coherence with frequency @xmath63 along @xmath20 in the 2d spectrum in figure 8(e ) and the resulting tomograph of the b domain , given in figure 8(f ) , confirm that the entanglement has been transferred with 85@xmath64 fidelity .",
    "residual dipolar couplings can be used to increase the number of qubits for quantum information processing . we have used a molecule containing 5 spins oriented in a liquid crystal matrix , and exploited the residual dipolar coupling to demonstrate it as a 5-qubit quantum computer .",
    "transition assignment is performed using het - z - cosy experiment and qubit addressability is achieved by transition selective pulses .",
    "it is expected that using this protocol higher qubits can be achieved .",
    "preliminary experiments promise a 8-qubit system @xcite .    for the implementations reported in this",
    "paper , evolution under the internal hamiltonian was not explored .",
    "it is however interesting to investigate how effectively the evolution under internal hamiltonian can be manipulated to implement quantum algorithms in these systems .",
    "efforts are ongoing in this direction in our laboratory , and recently a new method of preparing pseudopure states in oriented systems by exciting selected multiple quantum using evolution under effective dipolar hamiltonian , has been reported @xcite .",
