    "primary hadronic collisions in a typical nuclear reaction at rhic will occur at @xmath0 gev .",
    "such a collision is so violent that the partons , i.e. the quarks and gluons comprising the hadrons , will become deconfined . with hadronic densities exceeding the inverse volume of a typical hadron",
    ", the partons will remain deconfined and are expected to form a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . since transport theory descriptions of nuclear collisions have proven successful at lower energies , it is natural to attempt to describe the time evolution of the qgp using a transport model derived from qcd .",
    "a transport model would describe the time evolution of the parton phase ",
    "space densities throughout the collision .",
    "the procedures for deriving semiclassical transport equations using time  ordered nonequilibrium methods are well developed @xcite .",
    "in fact , there have been several attempts at constructing a qcd transport model based on these procedures @xcite , but each of them have their problems .",
    "chief among these problems is that one either treats the soft long  range phenomena ( in the case of @xcite ) or one treats the hard short  distance phenomena ( in the case of @xcite ) , but never both in the same framework .",
    "normally when one discusses transport , one assumes a separation between the interaction and the kinetic length scales . if one relaxes this assumption then one may be able to treat _ both _ hard and soft modes on equal footing .",
    "we have not done this for qcd , but we have made several steps toward doing the analogous thing in qed . our techniques also allow for a simple connection with the parton model .",
    "this paper consists of three parts , each one using qed to describe different aspects of the problem of constructing a partonic transport theory . in the end",
    ", we use our accumulated insight to discuss the shape of the parton cloud of a nucleon .    before outlining the paper",
    ", we must say a few words about our formalism . in the first two sections , we use feynman s formulation of perturbation theory . in feynman perturbation theory , one specifies the initial and final states of a reaction and calculates the probability of going from the initial to final state .",
    "thus , it is the appropriate tool for calculating observables for simple processes ( such as exclusive cross sections ) .",
    "for this reason , we use feynman perturbation theory to illustrate how the phase  space sources and propagators work and to calculate the reaction probability for some simple processes .",
    "we show that , in feynman perturbation theory , the particle phase ",
    "space densities have a `` source  propagator '' form .",
    "namely , the densities are a convolution of the probability to create a particle ( the source ) with the probability to propagate from the creation point to the observation point ( the propagator ) .",
    "we are not the first to consider writing transition probabilities in phase  space : remler @xcite discusses simulating many ",
    "particle systems in phase  space .",
    "remler s work is not immediately applicable to partons because it only applies to particles with large mass . for more complicated processes ,",
    "i.e. when we only know the initial conditions , we must resort to time  ordered nonequilibrium methods . in the last two sections we use time  ordered methods to derive the phase ",
    "space evolution equations , to derive the generalized fluctuation  dissipation theorem and to discuss the parton distributions of a nucleon .",
    "the generalized fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem shows that , in time ",
    "ordered field theory , the particle densities also have a `` source  propagator '' form .",
    "it should come as no surprise that we find similar forms for the particle phase ",
    "space densities since both formalisms are are equivalent descriptions of elementary processes . for simple tree",
    " type processes in the energy  momentum representation ,",
    "the moduli of the feynman and retarded ( or advanced ) single particle propagators are the same , so one can rewrite the reaction probability in terms of either @xcite .",
    "in fact , both sets of feynman rules are special cases of the contour feynman rules in appendix [ sec : lagrangian ] .    in the parton model ,",
    "a cross section is a folding of the parton distribution function ( pdf ) with the cross section for the partonic subprocess .",
    "the qed analog of the parton model is the weizscker ",
    "williams approximation @xcite since a cross section in the weizscker ",

    "williams approximation in phase ",

    " space , we also illustrate how we do our momentum  space to phase ",
    "space conversions .",
    "next , we write the reaction probability for photon exchange in phase  space . comparing the full reaction probability with the reaction rate density for absorbing a photon",
    ", we identify the effective phase  space photon distribution .",
    "this photon distribution is the effective photon number density in phase ",
    "space and it has the form of a phase  space source folded with a phase  space propagator .",
    "we calculate the photon number density surrounding a classical point charge and explain how the photon s phase ",
    "space propagator and phase  space source work . finally , we comment on the implications of this section for the parton model",
    ". we will find that we understand how partons propagate and have an idea how to make the gluon distribution gauge invariant , but since our photon source is point  like we do not learn anything about the parton sources .    to find the parton distribution functions , one can solve the parton evolution equations or equivalently one can sum up a class of parton ladder diagrams .",
    "the simplest parton ladder has one rung corresponding to a single partonic splitting . in section [ sec : edist ] , we study the qed analog of this process : a virtual photon splitting into a virtual electron and on  shell positron .",
    "we start our analysis by generalizing the phase  space weizscker ",
    "williams approximation to include electrons and writing down the effective electron distribution .",
    "this effective electron distribution takes the `` source  propagator '' form .",
    "while this `` partonic '' splitting leads to a complicated form of the electron source , the shape of the source is mostly determined by the underlying photon ( the `` parent parton '' ) distribution .",
    "we calculate the electron distribution explicitly for a classical point charge and discuss how the electron propagates from the source to the observation point .",
    "we have another reason for studying electrons : we can discuss a simple case where the `` source  propagator '' picture breaks down .",
    "this is the case of two virtual photons colliding to produce an electron positron pair .",
    "the `` source  propagator '' picture breaks down because the photon fields interfere on the length scale of the electron ",
    "positron creation region . nevertheless , discussing the process in phase ",
    "space gives us insight into the reaction dynamics .",
    "finally , we comment on the implications of the results from this section for qcd parton densities .    in feynman perturbation theory",
    ", both the photon and electron phase ",
    "space densities have a `` source  propagator '' form .",
    "this form does not usually arise when one uses time ",
    "ordered nonequilibrium methods because one usually derives transport theory only after making the gradient approximation .",
    "the gradient approximation amounts to ignoring small  scale structure of the particle phase ",
    "space densities , resulting in much simpler collision integrals @xcite . in section [ sec :",
    "nthgen ] , we follow essentially the standard semiclassical transport equation derivation , but never make the gradient approximation .",
    "thus , we arrive at the generalized fluctuation  dissipation theorem which codifies the `` source  propagator '' picture of the particle densities .",
    "crucial inputs to the theorem are the phase ",
    "space sources ; we will discuss how to calculate them . with the sources and the generalized fluctuation  dissipation theorem , we derive a set of phase  space evolution equations .",
    "these evolution equations describe the evolution of the system in phase ",
    "space from the distant past to the present , including all `` partonic '' splittings , recombinations and scatterings .",
    "furthermore , we can expand these evolution equations to get the lowest order contributions to the particle densities or we can differentiate the evolution equations to get transport equations .",
    "as a practical application of this study , in section [ sec : qcd ] we examine the coordinate space structure of the parton cloud of a nucleon . in principle , one should wigner transform the quark or gluon wavefunctions of a nucleon . since we do not know the quark or gluon wavefunctions of a nucleon ,",
    "such a specification is not possible and we must result to model  building .",
    "one might envision constructing a model phase ",
    "space parton density of a nucleon by multiplying the momentum space density ( the parton distribution function ) and the coordinate space density of the partons @xcite .",
    "this approximation neglects correlations between the momentum and position in the parton density which are present in the phase ",

    "one might insert these correlations using uncertainty principle based arguments @xcite .",
    "this has intuitive appeal , but such a prescription is ad  hoc at best .",
    "we can approach this problem in a more systematic manner using some physical insight from the momentum  space renormalization ",
    "group improved parton model . in this model ,",
    "the parton densities are calculated by evolving the parton densities in virtuality ( @xmath1 ) and in longitudinal momentum fraction ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this evolution is equivalent to evaluating a certain class of ladder diagrams and these diagrams can be re - cast in the form of the phase  space generalized fluctuation ",

    "this is in line with what others have estimated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we estimate that the small@xmath2 partons extend at least an additional @xmath4 from the bag so the small-@xmath2 parton cloud is substantially larger than the large@xmath1 cloud .    throughout this paper",
    "we use natural units ( @xmath5 ) when convenient , but we insert factors of @xmath6 whenever directly comparing a length to an inverse momentum .",
    "the signature of the metric tensor is @xmath7 .",
    "one calculates a parton  model cross  section by folding a parton distribution function ( pdf ) with the cross section for the partonic subprocess .",

    "second , we will calculate the reaction probability for one  photon exchange . in the weizscker ",
    "williams approximation , the reaction rate is supposed to be the effective photon distribution folded with the photon / current b reaction rate , so we can identify the the phase  space effective photon distribution .",
    "the effective photon distribution is a gauge  independent effective number density of photons .",
    "next , we calculate the phase  space photon density surrounding a classical point charge .",
    "this calculation will highlight how the photon source and the propagator function in phase  space .",
    "finally , we conclude this section with a brief discussion of the implications for a phase  space version of the parton model .    in all of our calculations ,",
    "we find the reaction probability .",
    "mapping our results to cross sections is trivial and is outlined in appendix [ sec : crosssection ] .",
    "since we are finding reaction probabilities , we work in feynman perturbation theory .",
    "we start this subsection by finding the photon / current b reaction rate , @xmath8 .",
    "this reaction rate plays the role of the `` partonic '' subprocess cross section in a parton model calculation . our derivation demonstrates how to rewrite the reaction probability completely in terms of phase  space quantities .",
    "the high point in this calculation occurs in equation ( [ eqn : itsawt ] ) when we identify the wigner transforms of b s current and of the photon field .",
    "this type of identification lets us rewrite the reaction probabilities in phase ",
    "space . to find @xmath8 we write the s ",
    "matrix for the process in [ fig : dis](b ) : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the free photon wave function ( with @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 is the current operator for the probe particle b. we leave both the initial and final states of @xmath13 unspecified so the final state may be a single particle or several particles ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis](b ) ) .",
    "we now square the s  matrix and average over photon polarizations : @xmath14 on writing the coordinates and momenta in terms of the relative and average quantities ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , and taking advantage of the momentum conserving delta functions in the current matrix elements , @xmath17 becomes @xmath18 there are two wigner transforms in this equation : the wigner transform of the photon field ( the @xmath19 integral ) and the wigner transform of b s current ( the @xmath20 integral ) .",
    "now we rewrite the s - matrix in terms of the phase  space quantities and define the reaction rate density : @xmath21 we also have defined the wigner transform of the current : @xmath22 since b s wigner current is proportional to the reaction rate , it is natural to give them the same physical interpretation : as a `` probability '' density , for absorbing a free photon with momentum @xmath23 at space ",
    "time point @xmath2 .",
    "now , it may not be clear where the spatial structure of the reaction rate comes from , especially since the incident photon is completely delocalized in space ( it is in a momentum eigenstate ) . to give the reaction rate spatial structure",
    ", we must localize either the initial or final states of @xmath13 with a wavepacket .      in this section ,",
    "we write the reaction rate for one  photon exchange ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dis](a ) ) in phase  space .",
    "we do it two different ways : in terms of the wigner transforms of the currents a and b and the photon propagator and in terms of the wigner transform of the photon vector potential .",
    "the first form of the reaction rate has a clear physical interpretation in terms of photon emission , propagation , and absorption .",
    "however , it is the second form which can be brought into the form of a `` partonic '' cross  section .    the s ",

    "we derive @xmath28 in appendix [ append : prop ] .",

    "the spatial structure of the integrand of ( [ eqn : photexch ] ) comes from localizing either @xmath30 or @xmath13 .",
    "now we take a detour and calculate the wigner transform of the vector potential of the current @xmath30 . in terms of the current density and propagator , the vector potential is @xcite : @xmath31 the wigner transform of this is : @xmath32 the wigner transform of the vector potential has a `` source  propagator '' form .",
    "current @xmath30 ( the photon source ) creates the photon with momentum @xmath23 at space ",

    "let us put this in equation ( [ eqn : photexch ] ) , @xmath33 stated this way , the spatial structure of the integrand of this equation comes from either localizing @xmath13 or from the spatial structure in the wigner transform of the photon vector potential .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : halfway ] ) is close to the form of a cross section in the parton model because current @xmath13 is proportional to the photon / current b reaction rate ( as discussed in the previous subsection ) and the vector potential is proportional to the phase ",

    "the effective photon distribution we derive here is the phase ",

    "we will discuss the gauge independence of our effective photon distribution .",
    "if the photon probing @xmath36 is sufficiently delocalized in space ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , the momentum ",
    "space cutting rules tell us that we can expand @xmath36 in terms of the photon polarization vectors @xcite : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the scalar ( i.e. time  like ) polarization vector : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the momentum of b. the transverse polarization vectors , @xmath42 , span the hyperplane perpendicular to @xmath39 and @xmath43 . now , if @xmath44 is not delocalized , then eq .  ( [ eqn : hadrontensor ] )",
    "should be modified to include gradients in @xmath2 . however ,",
    "if we were to include those gradients here , we could not map @xmath36 to @xmath45 .    since @xmath46 , it is simple to find the separate currents in ( [ eqn : hadrontensor ] ) in terms of @xmath36 : @xmath47 and @xmath48 the longitudinal piece , @xmath49 , vanishes due to current conservation .",
    "if we insert ( [ eqn : hadrontensor ] ) into equation ( [ eqn : photexch ] ) , the reaction probability is a sum of two terms : @xmath50 the two terms in ( [ eqn : factorized ] ) describe transverse and scalar photon exchange between currents a and b , respectively .    noting that if @xmath51 has a weak @xmath34 dependence , , while in section [ sec : pabsrate ] the reaction rate was for on  shell photons only . ]",
    "then @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , @xmath51 is proportional to the reaction rate for the `` partonic '' subprocess .",
    "therefore , the transverse term of ( [ eqn : factorized ] ) can be written as @xmath53 provided we identify the transverse effective photon distribution as @xmath54 we can make a similar identification with the scalar term .",

    "this generalizes the weizscker ",
    "williams method to phase  space .",
    "while classical derivations of the weizscker  williams method begin with finding the photon power spectra from the poynting flux @xcite , a quantum mechanical derivation follows along the lines of what we do here @xcite .",
    "were we to perform the spatial integrals in ( [ eqn : factorized ] ) , we would find that the exponentials in the wigner transforms conspire to make several delta functions .",
    "the resulting delta function integrations are trivial and we would quickly recover the momentum  space result .    now , multiplying the photon phase  space density by the projection tensor @xmath56 in ( [ eqn : wwapprox2 ] )",
    "does _ not _ render the photon distribution gauge invariant , unlike in momentum space @xcite , because the photon distribution is not completely delocalized .",
    "when @xmath57 undergoes a gauge transformation , terms proportional to @xmath58 are removed but terms proportional to @xmath59 are not . a gauge invariant virtual photon distribution is introduced below .",
    "this gauge invariant distribution reduces to ( [ eqn : wwapprox2 ] ) when @xmath44 is sufficiently delocalized .",
    "parton densities are supposed to be gauge invariant but our effective photon distribution is gauge dependent . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how @xmath57 transforms under a change of gauge , determine the gauge invariant part of @xmath57 , and state how the gauge invariant part of @xmath57 is related to the effective photon phase  space distribution .    in the energy ",
    "momentum representation , gauge transforming the photon field adds an arbitrary function in the direction of the photon momentum to the photon vector potential : @xmath60 .",
    "because components of @xmath61 in the direction of @xmath58 are gauge dependent , we can write @xmath61 as a sum of the gauge independent and dependent parts : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the gauge dependent part of @xmath61 and @xmath64 is the gauge independent part . wigner transforming the photon field gives us a term that is gauge independent and terms which are gauge dependent : @xmath65        \\left[a_{\\nu}^{\\|}(q-\\tilde{q}/2)+a_{\\nu}^{\\bot}(q-\\tilde{q}/2)\\right]^{*}\\\\     & \\equiv & \\displaystyle { { a}_{\\mu \\nu}^{\\bot\\bot}\\!\\left ( x , q \\right ) }        + { { a}_{\\mu \\nu}^{\\bot\\|}\\!\\left ( x , q \\right)}+{{a}_{\\mu \\nu}^{\\|\\bot}\\!\\left ( x , q \\right ) }        + { { a}_{\\mu \\nu}^{\\|\\|}\\!\\left ( x , q \\right)}. \\end{array } \\label{eqn : proj1}\\ ] ] the only gauge independent piece of @xmath57 is @xmath66 .",
    "we do the integrals in ( [ eqn : proj1 ] ) and identify the tensor that projects off the gauge dependent part of @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 this projector must be understood as a series in @xmath43 and @xmath70 , so can only really be used when @xmath71 .",
    "now , the statement of current conservation for a general @xmath72 is @xmath73 so , as expected , current conservation ensures that only the gauge independent part of @xmath57 appears in the reaction probability .    with @xmath66 in hand , we can postulate the gauge invariant photon distribution : @xmath74 this reduces to ( [ eqn : wwapprox2 ] ) if the photon field varies slowly in space ( i.e. we neglect the gradients @xmath75 ) , as we now show .",
    "neglecting the derivatives in ( [ eqn : htensor ] ) , the projection tensor in ( [ eqn : proj2 ] ) reduces to @xmath76 since the  polarization  vectors form a  complete  basis in  minkowski  space , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "putting ( [ eqn : approxproj ] ) in equation ( [ eqn : wwapprox3 ] ) , we arrive back at ( [ eqn : wwapprox2 ] ) .    the tactic of projecting out the gauge dependent parts of the photon distribution works mainly because of the simple form of the @xmath78 gauge transformation .",
    "nevertheless , a variant of this technique probably could be applied to gluons .",
    "we now calculate the density for the simple case of a classical point charge radiating photons .",
    "if we localize the source s wavepacket and view it on a length scale larger than its localization scale , we can treat its density as a delta function .",
    "thus , the shape of the photon distribution is determined the photon propagation and we can use this calculation to illustrate how partons propagate in phase  space .",
    "we explain that , despite our use of feynman perturbation theory , the photon propagates via the wigner transform of the retarded ( time  ordered ) propagator . as such",
    ", the photon propagates a distance of roughly @xmath79 in the direction parallel to the photon 3momentum and @xmath80 in the direction perpendicular to the photon 3momentum .",
    "we demonstrate this behavior by plotting the coordinate  space distribution of photons with @xmath81 ( making the photons collinear with the source ) and with @xmath82 . in appendix",
    "[ append : static ] we examine the additional case of a static point charge ( i.e. @xmath83 ) .",
    "this case is not relevant for partons as a parton source must be taken in the limit @xmath84 .      for our source",
    "current , we assume the source particle s wavepacket is localized on the length scales that our photons can resolve so we can replace its current with the current of a point particle ( we discuss when this replacement is valid in appendix [ append : current ] ) . the source particle follows a classical trajectory @xmath85 with four  velocity @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "ignoring the recoil caused by photon emission , the current of the point charge is @xcite @xmath89 the wigner transform of this is the classical wigner current : @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the qed coupling constant .",
    "the current has several easy to interpret features .",
    "the first delta function sets @xmath92 .",
    "this ensures that the emitted photons are space  like and that current is conserved .",
    "it also insures that , when @xmath93 , the photons become collinear with the emitting particle ( @xmath94 making @xmath95 ) .",
    "this delta function arises because we neglect the recoil of the point charge as it emits a photon .",
    "the second delta function insures that the source is point  like and follows its classical trajectory .",
    "this source has one other feature of note : it allows for emission of both positive and negative energy photons . in the following work",
    ", we consider creating only positive energy photons so we insert a factor of @xmath96 in ( [ eqn : classcurrent ] ) .",
    "this amounts to constraining the source s initial energy to be greater its final energy .      for our phase ",
    "space propagator , we take the wigner transform of the retarded propagator instead of the wigner transform of the feynman propagator .",
    "this replacement is legal since the reaction probability may be expressed in terms of either propagator , provided one uses the same asymptotic states in both cases .",
    "both propagators will give different particle densities at intermediate stages but the final state particle densities converge as time goes to @xmath97 .",
    "we use the retarded propagator here because it leads to a more transparent interpretation fo the particle densities .",
    "we discuss the feynman propagator in our discussion of the electron distribution of the point charge .",
    "the wigner transform of the retarded propagator gives the weight for a particle with four  momentum @xmath43 to propagate across the space  time separation @xmath98 . in the lorentz gauge ,",
    "the retarded photon propagator , @xmath99 , is proprtional to the retarded scalar propagator @xmath100 : @xmath101 the retarded scalar propagator is @xmath102 and it is derived in appendix [ append : prop ] . in this expression ,",
    "the lorentz invariant @xmath103 is @xmath104 .",
    "let us now estimate how far the retarded propagator can send a particle with the momentum @xmath105 .",
    "first , the retarded propagator has two theta functions , one that enforces causality and one that forces propagation inside the light cone .",
    "the rest of the interesting features of the propagator are tied up in the dependence on @xmath103 . since @xmath106",
    ", the particle can not propagate farther than the inequalities @xmath107 allow . to see what these constraints mean",
    ", we investigate the @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath11 cases separately .",
    "to study the @xmath108 case , we position ourselves in the frame where @xmath110 . in this frame , the @xmath103 constraint translates into a restriction on the spatial distance a particle can propagate : @xmath111 combined with the light  cone constraint , @xmath112 is constrained to    @xmath113    to find a cutoff for @xmath114 , we realize that , for a given @xmath115 , the propagator gives the `` probability '' distribution for propagating across the space  time displacement @xmath116 .",

    "@xmath370 is usually interpreted as a momentum cut  off in perturbation theory ; as one approaches @xmath370 , nonperturbative effects increase and perturbation treatments break down .",
    "this interpretation may not be appropriate for several reasons .",
    "first , the phase  space evolution equations are non  perturbative objects , so there should be no cut  off in momentum .",
    "second , it is not clear whether @xmath370 should viewed as a cut  off in momentum or whether @xmath371 should be viewed as a cut  off in coordinates .",
    "in fact , it may be that @xmath371 is simply a characteristic length scale for qcd bound states ( i.e. hadrons ) so that higher  order correlations ( i.e. four and six point functions ) need to be built into the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations .",
    "presumably this would require some understanding of hadronization . nevertheless , in the absence of a phase  space evolution equation , we can still use the generalized fluctuation ",

    "this is what we do in the next section .",
    "we can not calculate the phase ",
    "space parton distribution functions without a set of qcd phase  space evolution equations .",
    "nevertheless , there is significant work calculating the parton distribution functions in momentum ",
    "space and many of these results can be translated into phase  space .",
    "in particular , we show that the leading logarithm approximation works in phase  space . using the momentum ordering in the leading logarithm approximation and a simple model of the nucleon we estimate the size of the sea parton distribution as a function of parton momentum .",
    "the parton model rests on a two simple assumptions : @xmath372 ( so perturbation theory is valid ) and the parton lifetime is much larger than parton interaction time @xcite . both of these conditions are necessary to factorize a cross section in a momentum  space calculation .",
    "typically the parton distribution functions are calculated using either dglap , bfkl , or glr evolution , all of which are equivalent to applying a leading logarithm approximation ( lla ) . in the lla",
    ", we assume the parton is produced in a cascade represented by the ladder diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : noneqnthgen ] .",
    "the probability of emitting the @xmath373 parton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath374 and transverse momentum @xmath375 from this cascade is @xcite @xmath376 thus , by ordering the momentum properly as we go down the ladder , we can pick up the largest logarithmic contributions to the @xmath373 parton s density .",
    "most hadron colliders probe regions where the data are well described with parton distribution functions calculated within the dokshitzer  gribov  lipatov  altarelli  parisi ( dglap ) evolution scheme .",
    "dglap evolution is equivalent the leading logarithm approximation in @xmath377 ( lla(@xmath1 ) ) .",
    "new experiments at hera are beginning to see evidence that balitsky ",
    "kuraev  lipatov ( bfkl ) type evolution is necessary to describe the parton distribution functions at small@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "type physics is believed to be responsible for the rise in the number of partons as @xmath378 , however this rise can also be partially described by dglap ",
    "type physics @xcite .",
    "bfkl evolution is equivalent the leading logarithm approximation in @xmath379 ( lla(@xmath2 ) ) . unlike dglap and bfkl evolution , gribov ",
    "ryskin ( glr ) type evolution does not have a simple momentum ordering because one sums terms with varying powers of @xmath379 and @xmath377 @xcite .",
    "because of the simplicity of the ladder structure and the momentum ordering needed to pick up the largest contributions , we will discuss both dglap and bfkl type partons in phase  space .",
    "we can apply the parton model and lla in phase ",
    "space if both are modified appropriately .",
    "assume that we are working in a regime where @xmath372 , so we can apply phase  space perturbation theory , and assume that all elementary particles are massless .",
    "assume also that the probe is localized on the length scale of the parton cloud .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to saying the parton lifetime is large compared to the interaction time .",
    "now , if we find the same singularities in both phase  space and momentum  space , then we know that the lla will give the dominant contribution to the particle densities in phase  space .",
    "the generalized fluctuation dissipation theorem tells us that the parton density has the form @xmath380 the self ",
    "energy , @xmath381 , is given by the parton ladder in fig .",
    "[ fig : noneqnthgen ] and the @xmath373 segment of @xmath381 is shown in fig .",

    "space , the cut rung gives a @xmath181 which leads to the @xmath382 in equation ( [ eqn : emitprob ] ) . to see how the factor of @xmath181 arises in phase ",
    "space , one needs only look at the electron source in section [ sec : esource ] .",
    "the electron source has exactly the form of the segment in fig . [",
    "fig : rung ] and in that calculation we found exactly this factor of @xmath181 .",
    "the fact that we find the same factor of @xmath181 in both the energy  momentum representation and in phase ",
    "space simply reflects the fact that the cut parton density is @xmath383 in both cases and we sum over final parton states .",
    "the factor of @xmath384 occurs in equation ( [ eqn : emitprob ] ) because of the integration over the leg s propagator @xmath377 . in phase ",
    "space , the @xmath377 pole is tied up in the wigner transform of the retarded propagator , but it is still there : @xmath385 thus , this segment of the parton ladder produces the same divergencies in phase  space and momentum  space .",
    "whatever orderings are needed to produce the leading contributions in momentum space will produce the same leading contributions in phase  space .",
    "our self  energy has the same ladder structure as the electron source in section [ sec : edist ] , so we know the spatial structure of the @xmath373 parton s source is given by the @xmath386 parton s distribution .",
    "iterating back to the @xmath387 parton ( a valence quark ) , we see that the shape of the valence distribution sets the shape of the sea parton source .",
    "we take the valence quark wavefunction to be uniformly spread throughout a bag with radius @xmath388 .",
    "since we are interested in high  energy collisions , we take the nucleon bag to be moving to the right with 4momentum @xmath389 with @xmath390 .",
    "thus , this nucleon has 4velocity @xmath391 and the bag is contracted in the longitudinal direction by a factor of @xmath392 .",
    "we assume the partons lose memory of the original valence quark momentum as one goes down the ladder .",
    "thus , any momentum / coordinate correlations in the source function should be washed out by the spatial integrations in equation ( [ eqn : negeneric ] ) .",
    "one might expect that the sea partons forget the shape of the nucleon bag as well , but we show that the partons can not propagate far enough from the original source for this to happen .      in the large@xmath1 regime , the parton density is low but @xmath393 . here",
    "the largest contribution to the leading log ladder comes from large @xmath1 logarithms .",
    "can be taken as the typical momentum scale of the process . in the case of a dis probe",
    ", this is the momentum transferred by the probe . ] to get the largest contributions from these logs , we order the momenta as we move down the ladder : @xmath394 here @xmath395 is the virtuality of the @xmath396 leg . the kinematics at each leg  rung vertex ensure that the momentum fraction carried by each leg is also ordered : @xmath397 whether a rung or leg is a quark or gluon is irrelevant , provided @xmath398 and the @xmath34 ordering holds .",
    "now , given that the proton has longitudinal momentum @xmath399 and the rungs and legs are massless , each generation of partons must have energy @xmath400 and transverse momentum of @xmath401 .",
    "let us discuss the general features of the parton cloud .",
    "the retarded propagator lets the @xmath373 parton propagate out to @xmath402 transverse to the parton momentum and to @xmath403 parallel to the the parton momentum .",
    "since @xmath404 , the parton momentum is approximately parallel to the nucleon momentum . because @xmath405 , the partons can never get far from the bag in the transverse direction and transverse spread of the partons will dominated by the bag size : @xmath406 . on the other hand , the longitudinal spread of the partons is roughly given by @xmath407 , so can be dominated by the longitudinal propagation distance @xmath408 if @xmath409 .",
    "in fact , for very small @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath410 ) the spread of the partons can meet or exceed the nucleon bag radius .",
    "furthermore , the actual distribution may be somewhat broader due to the propagation of the virtual partons between the subsequent emissions along the ladder .",
    "so , in our picture , the sea quark and gluon large@xmath1 distributions have the same transverse size as the parent nucleon , but the longitudinal size can be significantly bigger than the parent .",
    "furthermore , the drop off in the parton density in the longitudinal direction occurs at the characteristic radius of @xmath411 .",
    "this picture of the nucleon is consistent with the uncertainty principle based arguments of a.  h.  mueller @xcite , later user by geiger to initialize the parton distributions in his parton cascade model @xcite .      in the small@xmath2 regime ,",
    "the parton density is high and @xmath412 . the small@xmath2 partons are mostly gluons . in this regime ,",
    "the leading logs come from the @xmath379type singularities , i.e. from the cut rungs .",
    "typically the rungs are thought of as `` reggeized , '' meaning that each rung in the ladder is allowed to radiate gluons , leading to a large multiplication in the parton density .",
    "since leading logs come from the @xmath379 type singularities , the largest contributions come about by strongly ordering the longitudinal momentum fraction as one moves down the ladder @xcite : @xmath413 bfkl  type evolution has only a weak dependence on the virtuality of the partons as we move down the ladder , so we assume @xmath34 to be fixed : @xmath414 .",
    "this does not significantly effect the results of the analysis @xcite .",
    "now we must understand how the transverse momentum and energy of each parton leg changes as we go down the ladder .",
    "a well known effect of iterating the bfkl kernel ( equivalent to moving down the ladder ) is that the transverse momentum undergoes a random walk in @xmath415 @xcite .",
    "in fact , after iterating through a sufficiently large number of rungs , the spread in the @xmath416 distribution is given by : @xmath417 where @xmath418 .",
    "thus , @xmath375 can be orders of magnitude larger or smaller than @xmath419 .",
    "we restate this as @xmath420 we will consider the extreme cases of the transverse momentum and comment on the typical case , @xmath421 .    if the random walk results in a large transverse momentum , we will have @xmath422 .",
    "thus , the @xmath373 parton will have 3momentum in the transverse direction .",
    "we know that the parton can only propagate to a distance of roughly @xmath423 in the direction parallel to @xmath146 .",
    "since @xmath424 , the parton can not travel far from the original source in the transverse direction .",
    "on the other hand , the parton s longitudinal spread can be larger than the longitudinal bag size .",
    "the parton can propagate to a distance of @xmath425 in the direction perpendicular to @xmath146 , so we can expect a longitudinal spread of the parton distribution of @xmath426 . since @xmath427 , this additional spread can not match the spread of the dglap partons .    if the random walk results in a small transverse momentum , we will have @xmath428 . in this case , the @xmath373 parton will have 3momentum in the longitudinal direction . as in the case of the dglap partons",
    "the additional transverse spread is @xmath429 and so is negligible .",
    "the additional longitudinal spread is @xmath430 and may be significantly larger than the bag radius because the parton is space  like .",
    "summarizing both possibilities , the bfkl parton distributions have the same transverse spread , @xmath431 , but different longitudinal spreads .",
    "the longitudinal spread may range from @xmath432 to @xmath433 for partons with space  like momentum .",
    "the fact that the spatial extent of the bfkl cloud is so large in the longitudinal direction suggests that the small@xmath2 partons ( which are mostly gluons ) can see the color charge of any other nucleon in the longitudinal tube centered on the parent nucleon .",
    "this suggests that we should treat the nucleus as a whole as a source of color charge in the spirit of mclerran  venugopalan model @xcite .",
    "the large longitudinal extant of the small@xmath2 cloud has another consequence : in a zero impact parameter nucleon ",
    "nucleon collision , we would find that the soft ( bfkl ) partons interact much earlier than the harder ( dglap ) partons because of their greater longitudinal spread .",
    "this , coupled with the large density of small@xmath2 partons , leads to earlier entropy production and stopping of the soft partons .",
    "we have made progress toward specifying the initial phase ",
    "space parton distributions of a relativistic nuclear collision . regardless of the kinematical regime ,",
    "the transverse spread of a parton distribution is dominated by the bag radius @xmath434 fm .",
    "the longitudinal spread of a parton distribution varies from roughly @xmath435 for moderate to large @xmath2 ( i.e. for dglap partons ) and from @xmath436 to @xmath437 for small @xmath2 ( i.e. bfkl partons ) .",
    "since the small @xmath2 partons have a large longitudinal spread and a high density , we expect the small @xmath2 partons to interact much earlier than the large @xmath2 partons in a typical nuclear collision .",
    "this would cause earlier entropy production and higher stopping than one expects in models that include only dglap parton distributions such as the pcm @xcite , hijing @xcite , and others .    using time  ordered non  equilibrium methods , we derived phase  space evolution equations for qed , illustrating how to find them in qcd . unlike conventional transport approaches , our calculation does not rely on the gradient approximation .",
    "thus , it should work on all length and momentum scales .",
    "these phase  space evolution equations describe the complete evolution of a system from some time in the distant past to the present , including all splittings , recombinations and scatterings of the particles .",
    "one can use these evolution equations perturbatively or to derive semiclassical transport equations .",
    "these evolution equations rely on the generalized fluctuation  dissipation theorem .",
    "this theorem states that a particle s density is the convolution of the wigner transform of its self  energy and a phase ",
    "space propagator .",
    "the generalized fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem is quite general and can be directly applied to qcd .    in conventional feynman perturbation theory , we found the reaction rates ( and hence the cross sections ) can be written in a parton model form .",
    "in other words , they take the form of a reaction rate density convoluted with a phase",
    " space parton distribution function .",
    "this phase ",
    "space pdf is the parton number density and has the form of a phase  space source folded with a phase ",

    "williams approximation demonstrates that the parton distribution functions can be defined in phase  space .    in order to illustrate how the propagators and sources work in phase  space , we calculated the effective photon and electron distributions .",
    "we found that both the retarded and feynman propagators propagate particles to distances of @xmath438 parallel to the particle s momentum and to distances of @xmath439 perpendicular to the particle s momentum when @xmath440 . when @xmath11 , the particles tend to follow their classical paths with deviations from this path being of order @xmath441 .",
    "furthermore , the retarded propagator can only send particles forward in time and inside the light ",
    "cone while the feynman propagator sends particles both forwards and backwards in time and both inside and outside of the light  cone .",
    "we also described a phase  space source that included a simple `` partonic '' splitting : the electron distribution of a point charge .",
    "these electrons are created when a virtual photon splits into an electron ",
    "positron pair ; the diagram for this process is the first segment of a parton ladder .",
    "we found that shape of the electron s source is controlled by the parent photon s distribution .",

    "first , we take the final state to be a momentum eigenstate and sum over it .",
    "since the final state is localized in momentum around @xmath501 , this is not a bad approximation .",
    "second , we take the initial state to be a classical wavepacket . in other words , we assume that the initial state is localized in momentum and delocalized in space but we probe it on such large length scales that we still see a spatially localized wavepacket .",
    "so , putting equations ( [ eqn : imfree ] ) , ( [ eqn : classdens ] ) and ( [ eqn : vertexthingee ] ) into ( [ eqn : currwvpkt ] ) and summing over final states , we get @xmath502 using @xmath503 and @xmath504 and assuming @xmath505 , we get the classical current : @xmath506 note that this current allows for emission of both positive and negative energy photons . to use the retarded propagators in section [ sec : pdist ] , we need a @xmath507 in equation ( [ eqn : yeaclasscurrent ] ) .",
    "we can do this by suitable choosing @xmath508 and @xmath509 and restricting the initial and final states to have only positive energy .",
    "in this appendix , we describe limit of @xmath83 of the photon distribution of the point charge in subsection  [ sec : classepd ] .",
    "since the spatial dependence of the effective photon distribution is controlled by the wigner transform of the vector potential , @xmath445 , we only discuss @xmath44 here .",
    "when @xmath83 , the photon vector potential becomes @xmath510 so @xmath44 is the wigner transform of the coulomb potential .",
    "we take the point charge to be resting at the origin and emiting photons with four  momentum @xmath511 .",
    "putting @xmath512 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : amunu ] ) , we find @xmath513 where @xmath514 is the angle between @xmath515 and @xmath146 and the dimensionless function @xmath516 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dimlessa ] ) .",
    "clearly the photon field is time independent and is composed of only zero energy photons .",
    "furthermore , by virtue of the @xmath517 singularity , the photon field is mostly composed of low momentum photons .    in fig  [ fig : coulomb ] , we plot the dimensionless function @xmath516 as a function of @xmath515 in the plane defined by @xmath515 and @xmath146 .",
    "note that the central region of the distribution is circular , but becomes elliptical as one moves away from the center . in the transverse direction ( i.e. the direction perpendicular to the photon three  momentum ) , the distribution approaches zero , but never goes negative .",
    "the width in the transverse direction is approximately @xmath518  fm . in the longitudinal direction ,",
    "the distribution drops to zero at about @xmath519  fm and oscillates about zero for larger distances .",
    "these oscillations are expected for a wigner transformed quantity and simply reflect the fact that @xmath520 and @xmath521 are fourier conjugate variables .    because the photon source is a point source ,",
    "the the shape of the coulomb distribution comes directly from the shape of the the retarded propagator in subsection  [ sec : retprop ] .",
    "thus , we can estimate the width of the photon distribution using the estimates of the retarded propagator in subsection  [ sec : retprop ] .",
    "in the both the longitudinal and transverse directions , the propagator width is @xmath522  fm , which is exactly the width we measure from the plots .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the effective electron distribution for electrons with a mass much larger than their momentum .",
    "this calculation is not included in section [ sec : edist ] because it is not relevant for partons .",
    "when the electron momentum is much smaller than its mass , we can use remler s propagators for massive particle @xcite .",
    "his propagator takes one of two forms depending on whether the electron momentum is space  like or time  like .",
    "his propagator is discussed in appendix  [ append : prop ] .",
    "we show a sample electron density for both the time  like momentum and space  like momentum cases .",
    "the momenta of the electrons are chosen to satisfy the requirements that @xmath524 and @xmath198 be real .",
    "these requirements are equivalent to the requirement that @xmath525 . since @xmath526",
    ", we must also have @xmath527 .    in section [ sec : esource ]",
    "we show that the electron s source is controlled by the parent photon distribution so we show the parent photon distributions next to the electron distributions in all subsequent plots .",
    "we do not restrain the photons to have @xmath528 as in section [ sec : edist ] , so our sources include negative energy contributions . because we use retarded photon propagators in our source , these calculations only serve to illustrate how remler s propagators function . in fact , had we restricted @xmath528 , there would not be enough momentum ",
    "space to perform the @xmath197 integrals and the electron distribution would be zero .",
    "the propagator for electrons with space  like momentum is : @xmath529 remler s propagator for space  like electrons has a very simple interpretation .",
    "first , the delta function forces the electron to follow its classical trajectory , but with the electron velocity defined as @xmath530 .",
    "the exponential in proper time strongly damps propagation that extends farther in time than @xmath531 along the classical trajectory .",
    "the fact that the proper time can extend forward or backwards in time simply reflects the boundary conditions of the feynman propagator .",
    "next , the sine and cosine cause the expected wigner oscillations .",
    "the rest of the terms simply give normalization .",
    "finally , this propagator allows propagation outside of the light ",
    "cone , but such propagation is strongly damped .",
    "this may seem strange , but should come as no surprise : the coordinate space propagator for massive particles propagates particles outside of the light ",
    "cone @xcite .",
    "we now perform the integrals over @xmath532 and @xmath533 in equation ( [ eqn : elecdist ] ) .",
    "the @xmath533 is a trivial delta function integral and the integral over @xmath532 can be done numerically . on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : edist1 ] we have a sample cut through the phase  space density for electrons with a typical space ",
    "like 4-momentum ( @xmath534",
    "mev / c ) . on the right is one of the underlying photon distributions .",
    "we chose the source velocity so that @xmath535 .",
    "this velocity is a compromise between having enough momentum space available for the electron and rendering the plot unreadable because of the lorentz contraction .",
    "now we examine these plots .",
    "first , we see the contributions from retarded emission and propagation ( upper left electron pancake ) and from advanced propagation ( lower right pancake ) .",
    "let us concentrate on the retarded electrons .",
    "at some time in the past , the photons split into the electrons and the positrons .",
    "the electrons than propagate forward along their classical trajectory until they reach the location of the left pancake .",
    "notice that this pancake has nearly the same size as the photon distribution on the right .",
    "the other photon distribution , corresponding to the other root of positron momentum , has a slightly different tilt and width , but the difference in the plots is not noticeable .",
    "the electron pancakes are slightly larger than the photon pancake , presumably because of momentum broadening from the emitted positron .",
    "the advanced electrons have exactly the same shape and size as their retarded brethren , but they followed a time  reversed classical trajectory , coming from some time in the future .",
    "remler s propagator for massive particles with time  like momentum is @xmath536 remler s time ",
    "like propagator does not have as simple an interpretation as his space  like propagator .",
    "delta functions still keep the particle on its classical trajectory , but the integrals in `` proper time '' are fourier sine transformed along this classical trajectory .",
    "thus , a simple peak in the underlying photon distribution will get fourier transformed into a series of peaks and valleys in the electron distribution .",
    "furthermore , the advanced and retarded branches enter with different signs , so we have large _ negative _ contributions from the advanced branch .      despite the difficulty in interpreting the propagator ,",
    "the @xmath537 and @xmath532 integrals can be done .",
    "a sample cut through the phase ",
    "space distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edist2 ] .",
    "these electrons have a typical time ",
    "like 4momentum ( @xmath538  mev / c ) and the source has a @xmath539 and is moving to the right .",
    "again , the source velocity was picked as a compromise between readability of the plot and available momentum space for the electron .",
    "we see the difficulty in interpreting the electron distribution .",
    "the fourier transform took a simple photon peak and produced a series of large electron peaks .",
    "the retarded branch corresponds to the envelope of large positive peaks on the upper left .",
    "the advanced branch corresponds to the envelope of large negative peaks in the lower right .",
    "each peak in the pair of envelopes appears to be a lorentz pancake , but the envelope as a whole is significantly broader than the underlying photon peak . presumably , averaging the distribution over unit areas in phase  space would result in a much tighter distribution .",
    "in this section , we state all of our phase  space propagators , discuss the symmetries of the massless propagators in some detail and outline the derivation of the retarded and feynman scalar propagators .",
    "the massive feynman propagator is discussed by remler @xcite so our discussion is brief .",
    "the dirac and vector propagators differ from the scalar propagators by the inclusion of either spin projectors ( in the case of dirac particles ) or polarization projectors ( in the case of vector particles ) so we do not need to discuss them .",
    "a time reversal transform in coordinate space is equivalent to a simultaneous reflection in time and energy in phase  space . under time reversal",
    "the @xmath357 and @xmath358 propagators change into one another while the feynman and anti  feynman propagators remain unchanged :      a parity transform in coordinate space is equivalent to a simultaneous reflection in a space coordinate and the corresponding momentum coordinate . under a parity transformation ,",
    "all of the propagators remain unchanged : @xmath543          we now present the massless feynman and retarded propagators .",
    "the advanced and anti  feynman propagators can be recovered using the symmetry relations above .",
    "since all of the massless scalar propagators are dimensionless and lorentz invariant , we expect that they will be functions of @xmath546 and @xmath547 and possibly theta functions in energy or time .",
    "in fact , the propagators are :    @xmath548\\nonumber\\\\          & & \\times\\displaystyle\\left\\ { \\theta ( \\lambda^2 )          \\frac{\\sin{(2\\sqrt{\\lambda^2})}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 } } -          \\theta ( -\\lambda^2 ) \\frac{\\exp{(-2\\sqrt{-\\lambda^2 } ) } }          { \\sqrt{-\\lambda^2}}\\right\\}\\\\        \\label{eqn : gcausdef }     { { { g}^{+}\\!\\left ( x , p \\right)}}&=&\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\theta ( x_0)\\theta ( x^2 ) \\theta ( \\lambda^2 )         \\frac{\\sin{(2\\sqrt{\\lambda^2})}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 } }         \\label{eqn : gretdef } \\ ] ]        the wigner transform of @xmath550 is easiest to do in coordinate space . in coordinate space , @xmath551 , so the wigner transform integral is a series of delta function integrals . performing the first delta function integral in ( [ eqn : propdef ] ) , and simplifying the theta functions , we find @xmath552 using @xmath553 , we can do the angular integral , giving us a bessel function : @xmath554 here @xmath555 and @xmath556 .",
    "this integral is in any standard integral table@xcite . after a bit of simplification ,",
    "one gets the result ( [ eqn : gretdef ] ) .",
    "this result can be checked by performing the wigner transforms in momentum space , but the contour integrals needed for this calculation are quite tedious .",
    "the simplest derivation of @xmath178 is far more complicated than the derivation of @xmath558 .",
    "we start by finding the transport  like equation of motion for the wigner propagator .",
    "is easier to derive using the transport  like equation . ]",
    "the derivation is simple and very similar to the derivation for the retarded equation of motion in section [ sec : transport ] .",
    "so we only state the result : @xmath559.\\ ] ] now we define a projector onto the space perpendicular to the particle s momentum , @xmath560 .",
    "this allows us to change variables to @xmath561 and @xmath562 . in terms of these variables",
    ", we find @xmath563 and the equation of motion becomes @xmath564.\\ ] ] so , instead of doing the wigner transform directly , we only have to solve this ordinary differential equation .",
    "we find the solution by integrating this differential equation .",

    " space version of equation ( [ eqn : propdef ] ) .",
    "we again change variable from @xmath2 to @xmath118 and @xmath567 .",
    "we also change from @xmath568 to @xmath569 and @xmath570 . with this",
    ", we perform the @xmath253 contour integral .",
    "the integral is straight forward , but tedious .",
    "however , when we take the limit as @xmath566 , the result simplifies dramatically : @xmath571 the delta function integral is trivial and the last pair of integrals requires integral tables , but in the end we find : @xmath572 plugging this into the solution of our differential equation , we find equation ( [ eqn : gcausdef ] ) .",
    "this result can be checked by performing a series of contour integrals in momentum or coordinate space .",
    "remler @xcite has found the wigner transform of the massive feynman propagator .",
    "this transform is difficult but , when one uses the approximation @xmath573 , where @xmath574 is the average momentum and @xmath568 is the relative momentum , the integrals become simple contour integrals .",
    "we state remler s result here : @xmath575 note that , because of the approximation made , this propagator is oversmoothed in the direction transverse to the particle s momentum and we expect these propagators to be accurate only for length scales much larger than the size of the smoothing .",
    "since the resulting propagators vary on length scales of order @xmath576 , we should only use these propagators for momenta with @xmath577 .",
    "note also that the sine and exponential functions in the two terms in ( [ eqn : remlerprop ] ) have the property that they become proportional to @xmath578 as @xmath566 .",
    "thus , this propagator reduces to the classical propagator@xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath579functions constrain the particle to more along its classical trajectory , even though its four  momentum ( and hence its four  velocity ) is being modulated by the sine and exponential functions",
