    "with the advent of new data from deep optical , near - infrared ( nir ) , mid - infrared ( mir ) and x - ray surveys , a considerable interest has been evolved to study low mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) as well as to study the evolution of circumstellar disks around the ysos associated with young star clusters ( e.g. , prisinzano et al .",

    "most of the disk evolution studies available in the literature are based on the nir/ mir excess which traces the evolution of inner accretion disks and it is found that in majority of the cases the inner disk does not last for more than @xmath2 6 myr ( see e.g. , haish et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "most of the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars are t - tauri stars ( ttss ) and have masses @xmath4 3 m@xmath5 .",
    "the ttss are further divided in to weakline ttss ( wttss ) and classical ttss ( cttss ) .",
    "the h@xmath6 and nir excess signatures in cttss indicate the existence of a well - developed circumstellar disk actively interacting with the central star .",
    "strong h@xmath6 emission ( ew @xmath7 10  ) in cttss is attributed to the magnetospheric accretion of the innermost disk matter on to the central star ( edwards et al .",
    "1994 ; hartmann , hewett & calvet 1994 ; muzerolle , calvet & hartmann 2001 , and references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the weak h@xmath6 emission ( ew @xmath8 10  ) in wttss , which lack disks ( or , at least inner disks ) , is believed to originate from their chromospheric activity ( e.g. walter et al .",
    "1988 ; martin 1998 ) .    since both types of ttss ( cttss and wttss ) are strong x - ray emitters , the x - ray observations of active star - forming regions and young galactic clusters play an important role in the studies of the star formation process and the properties of young pms stars ( e.g. , feigelson & decampli 1981 , guarcello et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the level of x - ray emission in pms stars , which is higher than that of field main - sequence ( ms ) stars , provides a very efficient mean of selecting stars associated with star - forming regions .",
    "however , the studies based on h@xmath6 emission may fail to detect part of the wtts population , which can easily be identified in x - rays .    several x - ray studies of low - mass pms stars have been carried out which revealed very strong x - ray activity , exceeding the solar levels by several orders of magnitude ( e.g. , feigelson & montmerle 1999 ; feigelson et al . 2002 ; favata & micela 2003 ; gdel 2004 ; caramazza et al 2012 ) . the influence of a circumstellar disk , and particularly the influence of accretion on x - ray activity has been of special interest .",
    "x - ray studies of pms stars in star - forming regions have yielded contradictory results ( see e.g. , stelzer & neuhuser 2001 , feigelson et al .",

    "the ttss show variation in their brightness in all wavelengths , from x - ray to infrared and have highly elevated levels of x - ray activity , however the relation between rotation and x - ray activity in ttss remained unclear until recently .",
    "stelzer & neuhuser ( 2001 ) have found that in the case of taurus - auriga region , pleiades and hyades , the rotation and x - ray emission are clearly correlated in the sense that faster rotators are more luminous .",
    "however , majority of the results do not find any correlation between rotation and x - ray activity ( e.g. , flaccomio et al .",
    "2003 , rebull et al .",
    "2006 , alexander & preibisch 2012 ) .    a number of data sets dealing with the observational relationship between rotation and magnetic activity for young stellar clusters with ages as young as 30 myr ( e.g. , prosser et al . 1996 ; stauffer et al .",
    "1997 ; jeffries et al .",
    "2011 ) are available , however the data is still lacking for younger clusters having ages @xmath4 5 myr . in view of the contradictory results",
    "as discussed above regarding the effect of the disk on the x - ray luminosity of cttss and wttss as well as the lack of observational studies on the relationship between rotation and the x - ray properties , we feel that the young cluster ngc 1893 having an age of @xmath2 2 - 4 myr and located at a distance of 3.25 kpc ( sharma et al .",

    "several photometric and low resolution spectroscopic studies of the region have been carried out ( for details see sharma et al .",
    "2007 , prisinzano et al . 2011 : hereafter p11 ) which manifest that star formation is still ongoing in the region and therefore ngc 1893 is an ideal object to study the x - ray properties of the pms stars .",
    "caramazza et al .",
    "( 2012 ) analyzed the x - ray properties of the class ii and class iii sources identified by p11 in the ngc 1893 region .",
    "they found that class iii stars appear intrinsically more x - ray luminous than class ii stars and concluded that this effect may be due to the presence of the  magnetically connected  disk itself or to the ongoing accretion from the disk to the star .",
    "however , in pa13 we have shown that the sample of the class ii and class iii ysos in ngc 1893 region identified by p11 on the basis of _ spitzer _ mir data was contaminated by the field stars .",

    "2011 ) used nir @xmath9 color - color ( nir - cc ) diagram to avoid the contamination due to field star population in the yso sample selected on the basis of _ spitzer _ data .",
    "hence it is considered worthwhile to re - analyze the x - ray properties of class ii and class iii sources and the relation between rotation and x - ray activity in ttss using the sample of the ysos identified by pa13 and the rotation period of the ysos determined by lata et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "on the basis of optical , nir , mir and x - ray data , p11 identified 1034 and 442 class ii and class iii ysos , respectively .",

    "the @xmath10 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the 367 and 246 class ii and class iii sources ( figure 14 of pa13 ) reveals that the contamination due to field stars is greatly reduced , however still we noticed a few sources classified as class ii sources by p11 below the 5 myr pms isochrone . to further avoid the contamination due to background stars , we have considered only those sources as the pms objects associated with ngc 1893 which are located above the 5 myr isochrone ( cf .",

    "the relation between rotation and x - ray activity in ttss remained unclear until recently , since in most studies of star - forming regions the number of x - ray detected ttss with known rotation periods was too small to draw any conclusion . the chandra orion ultradeep project ( coup , getman et al .",
    "2005 ) and the xmm - newton extended survey of the taurus molecular cloud ( xest , gdel et al . 2007 ) provided very sensitive x - ray data sets for large samples of ttss .",
    "these data revealed that the ttss in orion as well as in taurus do not follow the relation between rotation period and x - ray luminosity for ms stars ( preibisch et al .",
    "2005 ; briggs et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in addition the ttss spin up during the first @xmath2 10 - 30 myr ( herbst & mundt 2005 ) does not lead to an increase in the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this places doubt on the solar - like dynamo activity scenario for ttss ( alexander & preibisch , 2012 ) .    in fig .",
    "6 we plot x - ray luminosity l@xmath39 as a function of rotation period .",
    "the data of rotation period for 38 and 10 ttss have been taken from lata et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and lata et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) , respectively .",
    "the plot manifests that the ttss in ngc 1893 do not follow the well established x - ray activity - rotation relation as in the case of main - sequence stars , i.e. increase in x - ray activity with decreasing rotation period .",
    "the least - squares fit to the data points in fig .",
    "6 yields a slope of @xmath40 which indicates that the x - ray activity for the ttss in ngc 1893 seems to be independent of the rotation period .",
    "flaccomio et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found for the first time that ttss in onc having rotation period show higher x - ray luminosities than ttss do not have known rotational periods .",
    "the same has been found in the case of ngc 2264 ( rebull et al .",
    "7 shows x - ray luminosity distribution of ttss having rotation periods as well as ttss without data for rotation periods .",
    "the ttss with rotation periods show a uniform distribution for the x - ray luminosity whereas remaining tts sample peaks at log @xmath41 30 .",
    "on the basis of a comprehensive multi - wavelength study of the star forming region ngc 1893 , we continued our attempt to understand the properties of the stellar content in the young cluster ngc 1893 .",
    "this paper is focused on understanding the x - ray properties of ttss in the ngc 1893 region .",
    "the main results of the present work are as follow :    \\1 ) we found a correlation between x - ray luminosity , @xmath0 , and the stellar mass ( in the range 0.2@xmath12.0 ) of ttss of ngc 1893 , as already has been reported by several authors , however the values of the power - law slopes ( @xmath2 3.6 - 1.4 ) reported in the case of tmc , onc , ic 348 and chameleon star forming regions are higher than that obtained in the present study ( @xmath42 ) for ngc 1893 .",
    "the slope ( @xmath43 ) of the distribution of class iii sources in the case of ngc 1893 is found to be comparable to that reported in the case of ngc 6611 .",
    "\\2 ) the intercept of class iii sources at 1 ( log@xmath24 = 0 ) in the present sample has comparable value to that of class ii sources indicating that the presence of circumstellar disks has no influence on the x - ray emission .",
    "this result is in agreement with that reported e.g. , by feigelson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and is in contradiction with those reported by stelzer & neuhuser ( 2001 ) , preibisch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and telleschi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . on the basis of xlfs caramazza et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have concluded that cttss in ngc 1893 are globally less x - ray active than the wttss .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind that pa13 have already shown that the sample of class ii sources by caramazza et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is strongly contaminated by field population .",
    "\\3 ) the x - ray luminosity for both cttss and wttss is found to decrease systematically with age ( in the range @xmath3 0.4 myr - 5 myr ) .",
    "the decrease of the x - ray luminosity ( slope @xmath2 -0.6 ) in the case of ngc 1893 is faster than observed in the case other star forming regions ( e.g. , onc : slope -0.2 - 0.5 , preibisch & feigelson 2005 ; tmc : @xmath44 @xmath17 @xmath45 , telleschi et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "\\4 ) it is found that the upper bound of the distribution of @xmath30 vs log @xmath0 for the class ii sources ( cttss ) having @xmath30 @xmath46 @xmath47 appears to decrease with increasing value of @xmath30 .",
    "a similar trend has been noticed by rebull at al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the ( i - k ) excess versus log @xmath0 plot of ngc 2264 .",
    "this may be indicative of that the sources having relatively large nir excess have relatively lower @xmath0 values .",
    "the x - ray properties of the class ii and class iii sources of the present sample are rather same because a significant number of class ii sources have weak nir excess ( cf .",
    "present result suggests that cttss having higher nir excess ( an indication of the presence of inner disk ) could have lower x - ray luminosity because of higher extinction due to x - ray absorption by circumstellar disks .",
