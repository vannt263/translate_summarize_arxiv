    "one of the most fascinating aspects of modern astrophysics , is the possible existence of a new family of collapsed stars consisting completely of a deconfined mixture of _ up _ ( _ u _ ) , _ down _ ( _ d _ ) , and _ strange _ ( _ s _ ) quarks , together with an appropriate number of electrons to guarantee electrical neutrality .",
    "such compact stars have been referred to in the literature , as strange stars ( ss ) , and their constituent matter as strange quark matter ( sqm ) .",
    "the possible existence of ss is a direct consequence of the the so called _ strange matter hypothesis _ , formulated by witten  ( 1984 )",
    "( see also bodmer 1971 , terazawa 1979 ) . according to this hypothesis , sqm , in equilibrium with respect to the weak interactions , could be the absolute ground state of strongly interacting matter rather than @xmath2fe .",
    "ever since the formulation of this hypothesis , there have been several reports in the literature , on the structure of non  rotating ss ( e.g. haensel , zdunik & schaefer 1986 ; alcock , farhi & olinto 1986 ) .",
    "however , these have remained largely theoretical and speculative in nature .",
    "observational data from rxte of certain low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) have recently given rise to a resurgence in the astrophysical interest associated with ss .",
    "it has been suggested that at least a few lmxbs could be harboring ss .",
    "for example , recent studies have shown that the compact objects associated with the x  ray burster 4u  1820  @xmath330 ( bombaci 1997 ) , the bursting x  ray pulsar gro  j1744  @xmath328 ( cheng  1998 ) and the x  ray pulsar her  x@xmath31 ( dey  1998 ) are likely ss candidates .",
    "the most promising and convincing ss candidates are the compact objects in the bursting millisecond x ",
    "ray pulsar sax  j1808.4  @xmath33658 ( li  1999a ) , and in the atoll source 4u  1728  @xmath334 ( li  1999b ) .",
    "the compact nature of these sources make general relativity important in describing these systems .",
    "furthermore , their existence in binary systems imply that these may possess rapid rotation rates ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "particularly , the two ss candidates in sax  j1808.4  @xmath33658 and 4u  1728  @xmath334 are millisecond pulsars having spin periods @xmath4  ms and @xmath5  ms respectively .",
    "these two properties make the incorporation of general relativistic effects of rotation imperative for satisfactory treatment of the problem .",
    "most of the calculations on the rotational properties of ss , reported so far , have relied on the slow rotation approximation ( colpi & miller 1992 , glendenning & weber 1992 ) .",
    "this approximation loses its validity as the star s spin frequency approaches the mass shedding limit . rapidly rotating",
    "ss sequences have been recently computed by gourgoulhon  ( 1999 ) , stergioulas  ( 1999 ) , and zdunik  ( 2000 ) . however , all the calculations mentioned above make use of a very schematic model ( freedman & mclerran 1978 , farhi & jaffe , 1984 ) , related to the mit bag model ( chodos  1974 ) for hadrons , for the equation of state ( eos ) of sqm . within the mit bag model eos ,",
    "the ss radii calculated are seen to be incompatible with the mass  radius ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) relation ( li  1999a ) for sax  j1808.4  @xmath33658 , and only marginally compatible ( see fig .",
    "2 ) with that for 4u  1728  @xmath334 ( li  1999b ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present calculations of equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating ss in general relativity using a new model for the eos of sqm derived by dey  ( 1998 ) .",
    "this model is based on a `` dynamical '' density  dependent approach to confinement .",
    "in contrast , in the simple eos based on the mit bag model , the medium effects on the quark degrees of freedom and on the quark ",
    "quark interaction are not considered . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we compare our results , obtained using this new eos , with those for the mit bag model eos .",
    "we use the methodology described in detail in datta , thampan & bombaci ( 1998 ) to calculate the structure of rapidly rotating ss . for completeness",
    ", we briefly describe the method here . for a general axisymmetric and stationary space  time , assuming a perfect fluid configuration , the einstein field equations reduce to ordinary integrals ( using green s function approach ) . these integrals may be self consistently ( numerically and iteratively ) solved to yield the value of metric coefficients in all space . using these metric coefficients , one",
    "may then compute the structure parameters , angular momentum and moment of inertia corresponding to initially assumed central density and polar to equatorial radius ratio .",
    "these may then be used ( as described in thampan & datta 1998 ) to calculate parameters connected with stable circular orbits ( like the innermost stable orbit and the keplerian angular velocities ) around the configuration in question .",
    "the sequences that we calculate are : constant rest mass sequences , constant angular velocity sequences , constant central density sequences and constant angular momentum sequences .",
    "we also calculate the radius @xmath8 of the marginally stable orbit and its dependence on the spin rate of the ss , which will be relevant for modeling x  ray burst sources involving ss .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the schematic eos for sqm based on the mit bag model , has become the `` standard '' eos model for ss studies .",
    "however , this eos model becomes progressively less trustworthy as one goes from very high density region ( asymptotic freedom regime ) to that of low densities , where confinement ( hadron formation ) takes place .",
    "recently , dey  ( 1998 ) derived a new eos for sqm using a `` dynamical '' density  dependent approach to confinement .",
    "this eos has asymptotic freedom built in , shows confinement at zero baryon density , deconfinement at high density . in this model ,",
    "the quark interaction is described by a colour  debye  screened inter  quark vector potential originating from gluon exchange , and by a density  dependent scalar potential which restores chiral symmetry at high density ( in the limit of massless quarks ) .",
    "this density  dependent scalar potential arises from the density dependence of the in ",
    "medium effective quark masses @xmath9 , which are taken to depend on the baryon number density @xmath10 according to ( see dey  1998 ) m_q = m_q + 310 sech ( ) ( mev ) , where @xmath11  @xmath12 is the normal nuclear matter density , @xmath13 is the flavor index , and @xmath14 is a parameter .",
    "the effective quark mass @xmath15 goes from its constituent mass at @xmath16 , to its current mass @xmath17 , as @xmath18 . here , we consider two different parameterizations of this eos , which correspond to a different choice for the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the equation of state ss1 ( ss2 ) corresponds to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "these two models for the eos give absolutely stable sqm according to the strange matter hypothesis .    in order to compare our results with those of previous studies , we also use the mit bag model eos , for massless non  interacting quarks and @xmath21  mev/@xmath22 ( hereafter the @xmath23 eos ) .",
    "the equilibrium sequences of rotating ss depend on two parameters : the central density ( @xmath24 ) and the rotation rate ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "for purpose of illustration , we choose three limits in this parameter space .",
    "these are : ( i ) the static or non  rotating limit , ( ii ) the limit at which instability to quasi  radial mode sets in and ( iii ) the centrifugal mass shed limit .",
    "the last limit corresponds to the maximum @xmath0 for which centrifugal forces are able to balance the inward gravitational force .",
    "the result of our calculations for eos ss1 is displayed in fig .",
    "1 . in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) we show the functional dependence of the gravitational mass ( @xmath6 ) with @xmath25 . in these set of figures , the bold solid curve represents the non  rotating or static limit , and the bold dashed curve the centrifugal mass shed limit . the thin solid curves are the constant rest mass ( @xmath26 ) evolutionary sequences .",
    "the evolutionary sequences above the maximum stable non  rotating mass configuration are the supramassive evolutionary sequences , and those that lie below this limit are the normal evolutionary sequences .",
    "the maximum mass sequence for this eos corresponds to @xmath27  @xmath28 .",
    "the thin dot  dashed line ( slanted towards left ) represents instability to quasi  radial perturbations . in the central panel of the same figure",
    ", we give a plot of @xmath6 as a function of the equatorial radius @xmath7 . in panel ( c ) of fig . 1",
    ", we display the plot of @xmath0 as a function of the specific angular momentum @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the angular momentum of the configuration ) .",
    "unlike for neutron stars ( e.g. cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ; datta , thampan & bombaci 1998 ) , the @xmath0@xmath31 curve does not show a turn  over to lower @xmath31 values for ss .",
    "this is due to the effect of the long  range ( non  perturbative ) interaction in qcd ( quantum chromo ",
    "dynamics ) , which is responsible for quark confinement in hadrons , and makes low mass ss self ",
    "bound objects .",
    "@xmath0 for the mass shed limit appears to asymptotically tend to a non  zero value for rapidly rotating low mass stars .",
    "a further ramification of this result is that the ratio of the rotational energy to the total gravitational energy ( @xmath32 ) becomes greater than 0.21 ( as also reported by gourgoulhon  1999 ) thus probably making the configurations susceptible to triaxial instabilities . in table 1",
    "we display the values of the structure parameters for the maximum mass non  rotating ss models .",
    "the larger value of the maximum mass for the ss1 model , with respect to the ss2 model , can be traced back to role of the parameter @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the effective quark mass @xmath33 . in fact",
    ", a larger value of @xmath14 ( ss1 model ) gives a faster decrease of @xmath33 with density , producing a stiffer eos .",
    "table 2 and table 3 displays the maximum mass rotating and maximum angular momentum models for the eos models under consideration . while for eos ss1 , the maximum mass rotating model and the maximum angular momentum models are the same , for eos ss2 , the two models are slightly different , with the maximum angular momentum model coming earlier ( with respect to @xmath24 ) than the maximum mass rotating configuration .    in table 4",
    "we list the values of the various parameters for the constant @xmath0 sequences for eos ss1 .",
    "the first entry in this table corresponds to @xmath24 for which @xmath34 . for higher values of @xmath24 , @xmath35 ; for large values of @xmath24 , the boundary layer ( separation between the surface of the ss and its innermost stable orbit ) can be substantial ( @xmath36 km for the maximum value of the listed @xmath24 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 , we plot our theoretically calculated @xmath6@xmath7 curves ( dashed curves ) for eos ss1 and b90_0 , for a rotational frequency of 364  hz corresponding to the inferred rotational frequency of the compact star in the source 4u  1728  @xmath334 ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) . in the same figure",
    ", we plot the radius @xmath37 of the inner edge of the accretion disk ( dotted curve ) for 4u  1728  @xmath334 as deduced by titarchuk & osherovich ( 1999 ) ( see also li et al .",
    "1999b ) from a fit of khz qpo data in this source . since @xmath37 must be larger than both @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it is possible to deduce ( li et al .",
    "1999b ) an upper bound for the radius and mass of the central accretor .",
    "using these constraints on m and r , li et al .",
    "( 1999b ) concluded that 4u  1728  @xmath334 is possibly a strange star rather than a neutron star .",
    "however , in their calculation , li et al .",
    "( 1999b ) used an approximate eos  independent expression to account for the effects of rotation on the moment of inertia of the star and hence on @xmath8 ( see li et al 1999b for further details ) .",
    "in contrast , in this letter we make an `` exact '' calculation ( as a result of our accurate calculation of angular momentum and hence the moment of inertia ) of @xmath8 ( triple  dot dashed curves ) for the two eos ss1 and b90_0 .",
    "notice that the upper bound for the mass of 4u  1728  @xmath334 ( the intersection point between the curves @xmath37 and @xmath8 ) is about 1.15  @xmath38 , in agreement with the results of li et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "the two eos models considered in fig .",
    "2 are both consistent with 4u  1728  @xmath334 . also , having in mind the scaling with @xmath39 of the m ",
    "r relation of ss within the bag model eos ( witten , 1984 ) and the constraints on the allowed values of the constant @xmath40 to fulfil the strange matter hypothesis ( farhi & jaffe , 1984 ) , we see that the simple eos based on the mit bag model is only marginally compatible with the m  r relation for 4u  1728  @xmath334 . to summarize , in this letter , we present calculations of equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating strange stars in general relativity , for a set of new equations of state .",
    "we compare the results so obtained with those for the generally used mit bag model eos .",
    "in addition to this , we illustrate the results of our computations for a specific rotation rate inferred for the central accretor in the source 4u  1728  @xmath334 .",
    "we find that if the compact star in this source were indeed to be a strange star , then its mass and radius would be bounded above by a value of @xmath41  @xmath28and @xmath42  km .",
    "it is expected that future observations may shed more light on this issue .",
