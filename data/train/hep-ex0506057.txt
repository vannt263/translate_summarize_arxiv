    "one of the best ways to determine the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix element  is to measure the inclusive charmless semileptonic ( ) partial branching fraction of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "its theoretical prediction relies on an accurate description of non - perturbative bound - state effects of a @xmath0 quark in the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the effects are encoded in @xmath1-meson shape functions , which are not theoretically calculable and have to be determined experimentally .",
    "the leading order shape function can be determined using the photon energy spectrum in  decays , since up to the leading order of @xmath2 in the heavy quark expansion it is described with the same leading order shape function as the one used for the prediction of the  decays .",
    "such shape function determination was first performed by cleo on their  data  @xcite , and was then repeated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the belle  data , where the theory proposed by kagan and neubert  @xcite was used to describe the photon energy spectrum .    recently , bosch , lange , neubert and paz presented theoretical expressions for the triple differential  decay rates and for the  photon spectrum , which incorporate all known contributions and smoothly interpolate between the `` shape - function region '' of large hadronic energy and small invariant mass , and the `` ope region '' ( in which all hadronic kinematical variables scale with @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "the differential rate is given in terms of a leading shape function and a subleading shape function in the shape function scheme  @xcite , where in this scheme the leading shape function is expressed with the parameters  and .",
    "in this paper we report on the determination of the shape function parameters by fitting the belle  data with the predicted photon energy spectrum  @xcite , where the default subleading shape function model from ref .",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "it allows for a precise determination of @xmath4 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "apart from using an updated and more complete theoretical description of the  decays , this analysis differs from the one in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a different set of shape function model parametrizations , namely exponential , gaussian and hyperbolic .",
    "it also includes subleading shape function effects that were absent in the former analysis .",
    "we used a method based on that devised by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we fit monte carlo ( mc ) simulated spectra to the raw data photon energy spectrum .",
    "`` raw '' refers to the spectra that are obtained after the application of the  analysis cuts .",
    "the use of `` raw '' spectra correctly accounts for lorentz boost from the @xmath1 rest frame to the center of mass system , energy resolution effects and avoids unfolding .",
    "the method is as follows :    1 .",
    "assume a shape function model .",
    "2 .   simulate the photon energy spectrum for a certain set of parameters ; ( , ) .",
    "3 .   perform a @xmath5 fit of the simulated spectrum to the data where only the normalization of the simulated spectrum is floated and keep the resultant @xmath5 value .",
    "repeat steps 2 - 3 for different sets of parameters to construct a two dimensional grid with each point having a @xmath5 .",
    "5 .   find the minimum @xmath5 on the grid and all points on the grid that are one unit of @xmath5 above the minimum .",
    "repeat steps 1 - 5 for a different shape function model .",
    "three shape function forms suggested in the literature are employed ; exponential , gaussian and hyperbolic  @xcite .",
    "their functional forms are described in table  [ tab : sfforms ] : they are a function of @xmath6 and are parameterized by two parameters : @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "example shape function forms are plotted in fig . 1",
    ".    cc shape function & form + exponential & @xmath8 + gaussian & @xmath9 + hyperbolic & @xmath10 +   +   +   +     +    the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath0 are related to the hqet parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 by analytical expressions eq.46 and eq.47 in ref .",
    "@xcite for exponential and gaussian models , respectively , while for the hyperbolic model the corresponding hqet parameters have to be calculated numerically .",
    "the shape function parameters  and  are obtained from the hqet parameters @xmath11 and @xmath13 using the relations in eq.41 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the reference scale of @xmath14 is used .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the @xmath0-quark leading shape function parameters in the shape function scheme ,  and , were determined from fits of monte carlo simulated spectra , generated by the prescription in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the raw   belle measured  photon energy spectrum .",
    "three models for the form of the leading shape function were used ; exponential , gaussian and hyperbolic , while the default model from ref .",
    "@xcite was used for the subleading shape function , where the reference scale is chosen to be @xmath14 .",
    "best fit parameters are : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where  and  are measured in units of @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively",
    ". we also determined the @xmath20 contours in the @xmath21 parameter space for each of the assumed models .",
