    "if a nonconstant function @xmath17 satisfies with some @xmath18 and the boundary condition , then we call @xmath19 an _ eigenvalue _ of @xmath20 and @xmath17 an _ eigenfunction of @xmath20 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath19_. also , the _ geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue @xmath19 _ is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions associated with the eigenvalue @xmath19 . the operator @xmath20 in with potential @xmath21 is called _",

    "note that @xmath21 is a @xmath22-symmetric potential if and only if @xmath15 .",
    "before we state our main theorems , we first introduce some known facts by sibuya @xcite about the eigenvalues @xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "[ main2 ] the eigenvalues @xmath6 of @xmath20 have the following properties",
    "the set of all eigenvalues is a discrete set in @xmath25 .",
    "the geometric multiplicity of every eigenvalue is one .",
    "infinitely many eigenvalues , accumulating at infinity , exist .",
    "the eigenvalues have the following asymptotic expansion @xmath26\\quad\\text{as $ n$ tends to infinity},\\quad n \\in { \\mathbb n},\\ ] ] where the error term @xmath27 could be complex - valued .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ prop_sect ]",

    ", we introduce an entire function @xmath28 whose zeros are the eigenvalues of @xmath20 , due to sibuya @xcite . in section [ asymp_sect ] , we then provide asymptotics of @xmath28 as @xmath29 in the complex plane , improving the asymptotics of @xmath28 in @xcite . in section [ asymp_eigen ] , we will improve the asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalues . in particular , we will prove the following . throughout this paper",
    ", we use that @xmath30 is the largest integer that is less than or equal to @xmath31 .",
    "[ main_thm1 ] let @xmath16 be fixed .",
    "then there exist @xmath32 such that the eigenvalues @xmath6 of @xmath20 have the asymptotic expansion @xmath33 where @xmath34    one can compute @xmath35 directly ( or see equation ( 2.22 ) in @xcite with the identity @xmath36 ) and obtains @xmath37 in the last section , we prove the following theorem , regarding monotonicity of @xmath38 .    [ ineq_eq ] for each @xmath16 there exists @xmath39 such that @xmath40 if @xmath41 .    this is a consequence of .",

    "so theorem [ ineq_eq ] implies the following .",
    "[ main_theorem ] suppose that @xmath15 . then the eigenvalues @xmath19 of @xmath20 are all real and positive , with only finitely many exceptions .",
    "for the rest of the introduction , we will mention a brief history of problem .    in recent years",
    ", these @xmath22-symmetric operators have gathered considerable attention , because ample numerical and asymptotic studies suggest that many of such operators have real eigenvalues only even though they are not self - adjoint . in particular , the differential operators @xmath20 with some polynomial potential @xmath45 and with the boundary condition have been considered by bessis and zinn - justin ( not in print ) , bender and boettcher @xcite and many other physicists @xcite .    around 1992 bessis and zinn - justin ( not in print ) conjectured that when @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the eigenvalues are all real and positive , and in 1998 , bender and boettcher @xcite conjectured that when @xmath48 , @xmath47 , the eigenvalues are all real and positive .",
    "many numerical , asymptotic and analytic studies support these conjectures ( see , e.  g. , @xcite and references therein and below ) .",
    "the first rigorous proof of reality and positivity of the eigenvalues of some non - self - adjoint @xmath20 in was given by dorey , dunning and tateo @xcite in 2001 .",
    "they proved that the eigenvalues of @xmath20 with the potential @xmath49 , @xmath50 , are all real if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and positive if @xmath51 and @xmath53 .    then in 2002",
    "the present author @xcite extended the polynomial potential results of dorey , dunning and tateo to more general polynomial cases , by adapting the method in @xcite .",
    "namely , when @xmath21 , the eigenvalues are all real and positive , provided that for some @xmath54 the coefficients of the real polynomial @xmath8 satisfy @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .    however , there are some @xmath22-symmetric polynomial potentials that produce non - real eigenvalues .",
    "delabaere and pham @xcite , and delabaere and trinh @xcite studied the potential @xmath57 and showed that a pair of non - real eigenvalues develops for large negative @xmath58 . moreover , handy @xcite , and handy , khan , wang and tymczak @xcite showed that the same potential admits a pair of non - real eigenvalues for small negative values of @xmath59 .",
    "also , bender , berry , meisinger , savage and simsek @xcite considered the problem with the potential @xmath60 , @xmath61 , under decaying boundary conditions at both ends of the real axis , and their numerical study showed that more and more non - real eigenvalues develop as @xmath62 .",
    "so without any restrictions on the coefficients @xmath63 , theorem [ main_theorem ] is the most general result one can expect about reality of eigenvalues .",
    "also , the method used to prove theorem [ main_theorem ] in this paper is new .",
    "the method used in @xcite is useful in proving reality of _ all _ eigenvalues , but i think that some critical arguments in proving reality of eigenvalues in @xcite can not be applied to the cases when some non - real eigenvalues exist .",
    "the asymptotic expansion itself is interesting , and also implies theorem [ ineq_eq ] .",
    "note that is not enough to conclude theorem [ ineq_eq ] .",
    "finally , theorem [ ineq_eq ] and @xmath22-symmetry of @xmath20 explained right before theorem [ main_theorem ] above imply the partial reality of the eigenvalues in theorem [ main_theorem ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce work of hille @xcite and sibuya @xcite about properties of the solutions of .",
    "first , we scale equation because many facts that we need later are stated for the scaled equation .",

    "then @xmath65 solves @xmath66v(z,\\lambda)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath8 is a polynomial ( possibly , @xmath67 ) of the form .",
    "since we scaled the argument of @xmath17 , we must rotate the boundary conditions .",

    "the dashed rays represent @xmath70    it is known from hille @xcite that every nonconstant solution of ( [ rotated ] ) either decays to zero or blows up exponentially , in each stokes sector @xmath68 .",
    "that is , one has the following result .",
    "[ gen_pro ] @xmath71    * for each @xmath72 , every solution @xmath65 of ( [ rotated ] ) ( with no boundary conditions imposed ) is asymptotic to @xmath73^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\,d\\xi\\right]\\ ] ] as @xmath74 in every closed subsector of @xmath68 . *",
    "if a nonconstant solution @xmath65 of decays in @xmath68 , it must blow up in @xmath75 .",
    "however , when @xmath65 blows up in @xmath68 , @xmath65 need not be decaying in @xmath76 or in @xmath77 .",
    "lemma [ gen_pro ] ( i ) implies that if @xmath65 decays along one ray in @xmath68 , then it decays along all rays in @xmath68 .",
    "also , if @xmath65 blows up along one ray in @xmath68 , then it blows up along all rays in @xmath68 .",
    "thus , since the rotation @xmath78 maps the two rays in onto the center rays of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81    next we will introduce sibuya s results , but first we define a sequence of complex numbers @xmath82 in terms of the @xmath63 and @xmath19 , as follows . for @xmath83",
