    "the fermion spectrum near zero eigenvalue is closely related to gauge field topology and to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "while there is considerable experimental and theoretical support for chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories with dynamical quarks at zero temperature and theoretical arguments for its restoration above a critical temperature , the situation is less clear for the nominally simpler case of fermions in the background of quenched gauge fields . to improve our understanding of the quenched , deconfined phase , we have studied the spectrum of the hermitian overlap dirac operator  @xcite in that region .",
    "we find a segment of the spectrum concentrated at and near zero eigenvalue and separated from the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "the bulk of the spectrum begins to rise rapidly at larger eigenvalues .",
    "the exactly zero eigenvalues are associated with the global topology of the gauge field configurations .",
    "the statistical properties of the small eigenvalues are in correspondence with predictions from a dilute gas of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "small , non - zero eigenvalues with these properties give rise to a finite chiral condensate .",
    "gauge field topology plays a central role in qcd .",
    "the presence of gauge field configurations with non - trivial topology indicates that massless fermions will have exact zero modes .",
    "these zero modes cause an explicit breaking of the axial u(1 ) symmetry and result in a massive @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "conventional wisdom says that the axial u(1 ) symmetry remains broken at all temperatures since one does not expect a complete suppression of non - trivial gauge field backgrounds .",
    "recent studies using dynamical staggered fermions indicate that the axial symmetry most likely remains broken at high temperatures although the magnitude might be considerably smaller than at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "since topology is also expected to be suppressed at high temperatures  @xcite , this result is consistent with expectations .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking , on the other hand , comes from the finite density of eigenvalues near zero  @xcite , so we expect this density to be zero at high temperature in full qcd since chiral symmetry is restored in that case .",
    "the most likely scenario for the spectrum of the massless dirac operator at high temperatures is to have a delta function at zero due to topology , followed by a gap and a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues resulting in a theory with unbroken chiral symmetry and a broken axial u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "if we adopt the instanton picture for topology , we expect a dilute gas of instantons and anti - instantons at high temperature since the topological susceptibility is highly suppressed",
    ". however , this dilute gas of instantons and anti - instantons should not give rise to a chiral condensate in high - temperature , full qcd .",
    "a natural explanation in the context of instanton models is that instantons and anti - instantons form molecules at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "one expects that this formation of molecules is primarily due to interactions induced by fermions  @xcite .    in this paper , we will study the spectrum of the massless overlap dirac operator  @xcite on the lattice in pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theories on lattices with @xmath1 in the deconfined phase .",
    "we will study several different ensembles to understand the finite volume effects and also the effect of going deeper into the deconfined phase .",
    "in addition to directly studying the spectrum , we will also study the chiral condensate and scalar susceptibility . in some ensembles",
    ", we will also compare our results with those obtained using staggered fermions under these conditions .",
    "we have the following results :    * the overlap dirac operator has exact zero eigenvalues indicating that gauge field configurations with non - trivial topology persist in the high temperature phase . *",
    "the spectrum of the non - zero eigenvalues of the overlap dirac operator has two parts separated by a region in eigenvalue where the density is essentially zero . * * the distribution of very small non - zero eigenvalues of the overlap dirac operator is well - described by a dilute gas of non - interacting instantons and anti - instantons . * * the bulk part of the spectrum begins at larger eigenvalue and rises smoothly and steeply .",
    "* the very small eigenvalues of the overlap dirac operator have the properties that are needed to give a chiral condensate .",
    "the separation between the very small eigenvalues and the bulk of the spectrum results in a minimum in the scalar susceptibility .",
    "these features are qualitatively different from the staggered dirac operator in a quenched theory .",
    "the staggered dirac operator does not have any exact zero eigenvalues .",
    "studies with dynamical staggered fermions have indicated that chiral symmetry is restored at high enough temperatures in qcd with @xmath2 flavors of massless quarks and also in the quenched theory .",
    "early numerical studies of chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures using staggered fermions in the `` quenched '' approximation can be found in ref .",
    "further studies using dynamical staggered fermions have established a phase transition showing chiral symmetry restoration at high temperatures .",
    "recent reviews of the lattice results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite contains the most recent results for the @xmath1 phase transition .",
    "the lack of exact zero eigenvalues in the staggered fermion spectrum follows from the breaking of the continuum chiral and flavor symmetry at finite lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "the observed restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature is consistent with the prediction of ref.@xcite for su(2 ) gauge theory with staggered fermions .",
    "however , a gap in the spectrum of the staggered dirac operator at high temperature has not been convincingly established , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref.@xcite .",
    "a tail of small eigenvalues seems to persist , possibly consisting of the `` shifted '' would be zero modes due to global topology .",
    "the proof of chiral symmetry restoration at high temperature in ref.@xcite is for dynamical fermions , while we are only studying the quenched theory here .",
    "so , we could explain the presence , and even accumulation , of very small eigenvalues in the spectrum of the overlap dirac operator as a quenched artifact .",
    "this is not satisfactory , however , since staggered fermions in a quenched theory show no such accumulation of small eigenvalues , but rather a tapering tail of small eigenvalues , indicative of a chirally symmetric phase .",
    "as is well known , massless fermions are non - trivial to construct on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the overlap dirac operator is one solution to the problem .",
    "it is not ultra - local , _",
    "i.e. _ its interaction size is not finite , but its interactions are exponentially decreasing with distance .",
    "it therefore does not fit into the assumptions used in ref.@xcite , and the proof presented there need not hold even in the dynamical theory with overlap fermions .",
    "we do not address the issue of the existence of a chirally symmetric phase in the dynamical theory with overlap dirac fermions in this paper .",
    "care has to be taken in a finite temperature study in the quenched approximation . in the pure gauge case ,",
    "gauge field configurations with the polyakov loop phase near any @xmath3 phase are equivalent , related by a global @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "however , the coupling to fermions is not @xmath3 symmetric and the phase with the polyakov loop along the positive real axis is preferred .",
    "configurations with `` non - trivial expectation value '' for polyakov loop phase can give an `` unphysical '' signal for a chiral condensate  @xcite ( negative for su(2 ) and complex for su(3 ) with anti - periodic boundary conditions in the time direction for fermions ) . in pure su(n ) gauge theories , configurations with expectation values for the polyakov lines related by a simple @xmath3 factor are equally likely .",
    "we will therefore generate pure gauge ensembles so that every configuration has a positive expectation value for the polyakov loop and impose anti - periodic boundary conditions in the time direction for fermions .",
    "so in a sense , this is not a strictly quenched calculation , but has included in it by hand one important feature of the theory with dynamical quarks .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the second section",
    ", we will briefly summarize what we need to know about the overlap dirac operator .",
    "we will present our results for the eigenvalue spectrum in section iii and focus on the very small eigenvalues of the overlap dirac operator .",
    "we will show that the spectrum of the very small non - zero and exact zero eigenvalues is described quite well by a non - interacting dilute gas of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "we use the word `` dilute '' to emphasize that topology is highly suppressed and that the spectrum of these very small eigenvalues is separated from the bulk of the spectrum . we will present our data for the chiral condensate and scalar susceptibility and discuss the relationship between the small , non - zero eigenvalues and the chiral condensate in section iv .",
    "our conclusions are in section v.    similar studies of the fate of chiral symmetry breaking in the deconfined phase of quenched qcd have been done with domain wall fermions by the columbia group  @xcite who measured @xmath4 and found evidence of topology from its increase at small quark mass and by laga and sinclair  @xcite who studied low eigenvalues and meson propagators and found evidence of topology from both .",
