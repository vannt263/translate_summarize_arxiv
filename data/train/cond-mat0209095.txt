    "the most recent experiments on bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) stimulated a large wealth of theoretical work aimed at a better understanding of the basic properties of such interesting phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in particular the possibility of confining ultra - cold bosonic atoms within optical lattices , along with the most recent studies on arrays of josephson junctions , arouse a great interest in bosonic models defined on euclidean lattices @xcite .",
    "even more interesting from this point of view would be the arrangement of the josephson junctions , or possibly optical traps , into more complex networks @xcite .",
    "indeed it was recently put into evidence @xcite that , due to topological inhomogeneity , bec at finite temperature can occur on low dimensional structures , such as the comb lattice @xcite , even in the absence of external potential .",
    "such results were obtained mainly in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. for structures of infinite size ) , but it is clear that a deeper understanding of the onset of the phenomenon on finite - size structures is needed .",
    "this is especially true in view of the experimental research which is currently being developed in this field @xcite .",
    "one of the distinctive features of usual bec ( in continuous euclidean geometry , possibly in the presence of harmonic potentials ) is the macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state .",
    "more precisely it is possible to prove that the filling of any excited state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . as for general networks , refs . @xcite",
    "mainly deal with the thermodynamic aspect of the problem .",
    "in particular it is shown that on a low dimensional inhomogeneous network , such as the comb lattice , bec is characterized by the macroscopic occupation of the states belonging to an arbitrarily small energy neighborhood of the ground state .",
    "this is a more general condition , since it does not necessarily entail that only the ground state features a macroscopic occupation .    in the following we",
    "indeed show that the macroscopic occupation of the ground state does not entirely account for bec on the comb lattice . even in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the filling of the structure is completely described only if a finite number of states belonging to a small neighborhood of the ground state is considered .",
    "this result is proven by exactly evaluating the occupation of the quantum states of mesoscopic comb lattices , with large but finite size .",
    "the spectrum of such structures is nearly continuous , but the energy levels are still distinguishable since they pertain to orthogonal wave functions which differ on a macroscopic scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the pure hopping model @xcite which describes the low coupling limit for the josephson junction arrays or a model of non interacting atoms confined in an optical lattice . using the van hove spheres",
    ", we define the thermodynamic limit for a general infinite discrete structure .",
    "then we recall the definition of _ the low energy hidden spectrum _ and we give the general conditions on the graph spectra for the condensation in an arbitrarily small energy region @xcite . in section",
    "iii we consider the problem of the states filling for the pure hopping bosonic model comparing the known results for the 3-dimensional lattice with the numerical results obtained on the comb graph .",
    "we show that in the first case only the lowest energy state presents a macroscopic occupation , while the comb graph exhibits a different behaviour since a macroscopic occupation of many states is present . in section",
    "iv we solve analytically the problem of the states filling on the comb graph proving that , in the thermodynamic limit , also the first excited states are filled by a finite fraction of particles .",
    "furthermore we show that the numerical data perfectly fit the analytical predictions . in section",
    "v we prove that the macroscopic filling of many states gives rise to an anomalous behaviour of the large distance two point correlation functions .",
    "in section vi we give the spectral conditions for the pure hopping model to present a macroscopical occupation of a single quantum state and in section vii we present our conclusions .",
    "graph theory provides the most natural mathematical description of generic discrete networks @xcite .",
    "a graph is a countable set @xmath0 of sites @xmath1 connected pairwise by a set @xmath2 of unoriented links @xmath3 .",
    "two sites joined by a link are called nearest neighbours .",
    "the topology of a graph is fully described by its adjacency matrix @xmath4 , with @xmath5 if @xmath6 is a link of the graph and @xmath7 otherwise .",
    "a _ walk _ in @xmath8 is a sequence of concatenated links @xmath9 and a graph is said to be connected if for any two sites there is always a walk joining them .",
    "the length of a walk is the number of links appearing in the sequence , and the length of the shortest walk joining two sites is called the _ chemical distance _ between them .",
    "the latter defines the intrinsic metric every connected graph is endowed with .",
    "the van hove sphere @xmath10 of center @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 is the set of sites whose chemical distance from site @xmath11 is equal or less than @xmath12 . in the following",
    "we will consider only connected graphs with polynomial growth , where the number @xmath13 of sites within @xmath10 grows at most as a power of the radius .",
    "this choice ensures that the discrete structure can be embedded in a finite dimensional euclidean space . since for this class of graphs it is possible to prove that the thermodynamic limit is independent from the choice of the center of the sphere @xcite , in the following we will drop the relevant subscript .",
    "let us recall some basic results obtained for the pure hopping model on a generic graph ( a complete description of the subject can be found in @xcite ) . on a graph",
    "@xmath14 the pure hopping model for bosons is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the creation and annihilation operator at site @xmath1 ( @xmath18=\\delta_{ij}$ ] ) and @xmath4 is the adjacency matrix of the graph .    to study the behaviour of ( [ ham ] ) in the thermodynamic limit , where bec can arise , we restrict the model to @xmath19 and analyze its properties as the radius of the van hove sphere goes to infinity .",
    "the model restricted to @xmath20 is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "the corresponding normalized density of states @xmath25 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the eigenvalues of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the number of sites within the sphere .",
    "the function @xmath30 is defined to be the thermodynamic density of states of @xmath31 if it satisfies the following condition : @xmath32 in general the asymptotic behavior at low energies of the thermodynamic density of states is described by a power law of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is an exponent determined by the topology of the graph @xcite .",
    "on inhomogeneous structures the density of states can present some interesting anomalies , such as the _ hidden region _ of the spectrum defined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a _ hidden region _ of the spectrum consists of an energy interval @xmath36 $ ] such that @xmath36\\cap { \\rm supp}(\\rho(e))= \\emptyset$ ] and @xmath37}>0 $ ] , where @xmath38}$ ] is the number of eigenvalues of @xmath28 in the interval @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "notice that in general @xmath38}$ ] can diverge for @xmath39 and the eigenvalues can become dense in @xmath36 $ ] in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore the presence of a hidden spectrum is a far more general property than the existence of a discrete spectrum , where a finite number of states fills the spectral region .",
    "an interesting example of this new kind of behaviour is exhibited by the the comb lattice @xcite ( see figure 1 ) which will be studied in detail in the following sections .",
    "we now define the lowest energy level for the sequence of densities @xmath40 , setting @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in general ,",
    "@xmath43 . if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 $ ] is a hidden region of the spectrum which will be called low energy hidden spectrum .",
    "[ fcomb ]    the correct way of taking the thermodynamic limit consists in adjusting the population @xmath46 of the system so that the filling @xmath47 is set to a fixed value @xmath48 as the radius of the van hove sphere goes to infinity . in particular , in the macro - canonical ensemble , the equation that determines the fugacity @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 , @xmath48 and @xmath12 is : @xmath51 setting @xmath52 yields @xmath53 .",
    "a system presents bec at finite temperature if there exists a temperature @xmath54 such that for all @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "the general conditions for the occurrence of bec at finite temperature is strictly related to the properties of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "in particular it is proven that bec arises either in models presenting a low energy hidden spectrum or in models where the parameter @xmath35 appearing in equation ( [ asbeh ] ) is larger than two .",
    "the comb lattice is an example of the former situation , whereas the latter condition is satisfied by any euclidean lattice with dimension larger than two , since for such a structure the parameter @xmath35 coincides with the euclidean dimension .",
    "bec on euclidean lattices is characterized by the non - analytic behaviour of the thermodynamic functions at the critical temperature and by a macroscopic filling of a single quantum state . the definition of bec we gave in the previous section is strictly connected with the singular properties at @xmath54 .",
    "for example in the thermodynamic limit the average energy per particle is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 for temperature below the critical temperature , whereas for @xmath59 it is a function of @xmath60 and @xmath48 determined by ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "therefore the equation ( [ energy ] ) presents the typical non - analytic behaviour of the thermodynamic functions of bec at the critical point .",
    "let us now consider the filling of the states .",
    "below @xmath54 any arbitrarily small energy region around @xmath61 is filled by a finite fraction of particles , as it is known by classical results on bec .",
    "more precisely , for all @xmath62 the fraction @xmath63 of particles with energy in the region @xmath64 $ ] is always greater than the positive quantity @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath52 and the subscript @xmath67 stands for thermodynamic .",
    "since @xmath61 is the only real number belonging to @xmath64 $ ] for any value of @xmath68 , one would argue that the only possible way to satisfy the condition @xmath69 @xmath70 is to fill the lowest energy state with a finite fraction of particles .",
    "however if we look carefully to how the thermodynamic limit is performed , the question is not so trivial . indeed ,",
    "if the model does not present a gap ( this is also the case of the usual condensation on lattices ) , the energy of the first excited states tends to @xmath61 in the thermodynamic limit and it belongs to @xmath64 $ ] for all values of @xmath68 . for instance , in order to determine the filling @xmath71 of the first excited state @xmath72 , one first has to solve equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath73 and then evaluate @xmath74 .",
    "the result of this limit depends on how @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this limit is trivial on lattices : there the pure hopping model does not present a gap and it is known that below @xmath54 the lowest energy eigenstate is the only one with a macroscopic occupation @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the case of the three - dimensional lattice .",
    "the spectrum of a finite lattice of @xmath78 sites is given by : @xmath79 the equation determining the fugacity @xmath49 for each finite lattice is : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the filling of the ground state and @xmath82 is the filling of a state of energy @xmath83 . below the critical temperature equation ( [ fill3d ] ) has a solution in the thermodynamic limit only if @xmath84 for @xmath85 . in particular",
    "one has that : @xmath86 substituting ( [ zcomb ] ) in ( [ fill3d ] ) one obtains @xmath87 and @xmath88 hence @xmath89 and the lowest energy state is the only macroscopically filled state . as a further check of this result we can explicitly evaluate the filling @xmath71 of the first excited state in the thermodynamic limit . according to equation ( [ spec3d ] ) the energy of the first excited state is @xmath90 and , from equation ( [ zcomb ] ) , its filling is @xmath91 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in figure 2 we plotted @xmath65 ( obtained from ( [ ntd ] ) with @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 ( the filling of the lowest energy state ) , and @xmath63 for two different values of @xmath68 . to determine @xmath93 and @xmath63",
    "we first evaluated the exact spectrum of a finite lattice consisting of @xmath94 sites , then we obtained @xmath95 by numerical inversion of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to evaluate the filling @xmath96 of the energy level @xmath83 . from figure 2",
    "we have that the differences between the plots are very small and they can be ascribed to finite size effects .",
    "these numerical results confirm the known property of bec on regular lattices of presenting a macroscopic occupation only in the state of lowest energy .",
    "let us focus on the case of the comb graph proving that on inhomogeneous structures , due to the presence of hidden regions in the spectrum , a macroscopic filling of states of energy arbitrarily near to the ground state is possible . in figure 3 @xmath97 @xmath93 and @xmath63 for a comb graph consisting of @xmath98 sites are shown . in this case",
    "it is evident that , since the filling of the ground state ( the curve @xmath93 ) is lower than @xmath65 , there must be macroscopically filled states other than @xmath61 . from the general result ( [ ntd ] )",
    "the energies of these states must tend to @xmath61 as @xmath85 .",
    "actually , the curves @xmath63 representing the filling relevant to the energy region @xmath64 $ ] is very close to @xmath65 even for small values of @xmath68 .",
    "on the comb graph , the anomalous behaviour of the filling can be explained by carefully considering equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , which determines the fugacity for each finite - size comb .",
    "the energy spectrum of the pure hopping model on a finite comb graph consisting of @xmath99 is the union of four sets , @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath52 : @xmath101 the degeneration @xmath102 of the states of energy @xmath103 and @xmath104 is @xmath105 , while for the states of energy @xmath106 we have @xmath107 .",
    "hence , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are filled by a vanishing fraction of states ( @xmath110 ) and they belong to the hidden spectrum @xcite , whereas @xmath111 gives rise to the spectral region of measure one , since the relevant fraction of states is @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath111 reproduce the spectral density of a linear chain and its states are completetely delocalized . on the other hand the states in @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which characterize the typical behaviour of the comb graph , are localized along the backbone presenting an exponential decay in the direction of the finger .",
    "the equation determining the fugacity @xmath49 for a finite comb is @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "here @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 represent respectively the fraction of particles in the ground state and in the three spectral regions .",
    "more precisely @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the degeneracy of the energy state @xmath2 .",
    "let us analyze these four contributions separately .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the filling of the ground state , @xmath121 and the filling of the low hidden region , @xmath122^{-1 } , \\label{nsigma-}\\ ] ] are different from zero if and only if @xmath123 . the filling of the spectral region of measure @xmath124 is given by : @xmath125 @xmath126 is a finite positive number for each value of @xmath49 , @xmath114 . for the high hidden region @xmath109",
    "we obtain : @xmath127 hence @xmath116 can be neglected .",
    "let us consider the behaviour of equation ( [ fill ] ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "above the critical temperature it is satisfied by a value of @xmath128 so that , according to equations ( [ n0 ] ) and ( [ nsigma- ] ) , @xmath129 . on the other hand for @xmath130 equation ( [ fill ] ) can be solved only letting @xmath84 when @xmath85 .",
    "in particular we obtain a solution of equation ( [ fill ] ) if and only if : @xmath131    let us study in details the behaviour of @xmath132 and @xmath133 when @xmath49 tends to @xmath124 as in equation ( [ condz ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath134 and the fraction of particles in @xmath108 can be exactly evaluated by summing the corresponding series : @xmath135^{-1 } = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{2}{2 \\sqrt{2 }",
    "\\beta t\\pi^2 n^2 + \\delta}= { { \\rm csch}\\ , \\alpha \\ , \\left [ \\alpha \\cosh \\alpha -\\sinh \\alpha\\right]\\over \\delta } \\label{nsigma-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath136    then below @xmath54 equation ( [ fill ] ) for @xmath49 becomes an equation for the new variable @xmath137 , @xmath138 = f- n_{\\sigma_0}(1)=n_{td } \\label{fill2}\\ ] ] which can be numerically solved .",
    "hence , in order to obtain equation ( [ fill2 ] ) we had to evaluate the thermodynamic limit of equations ( [ n0 ] ) , ( [ nsigma- ] ) , ( [ nsigma0 ] ) , ( [ nsigma+ ] ) .",
    "we remark that only in the case of the spectral region of measure one it is possible to replace the sum by an integral , whereas in the other cases the sums have to be explicitly calculated .    equation ( [ fill2 ] ) explains the main properties of bec on the comb lattice .",
    "first of all in this case @xmath139 is the sum of two contributions , the first due to the particles in the lowest energy state @xmath87 , the other due to the particles in the low hidden region , @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "hence , on the comb graph , the filling of the ground state is smaller than @xmath65 , as it has been numerically shown in figure 3 .",
    "a second point is that only states with arbitrary small energy contribute to @xmath65 . indeed",
    "the result of equation ( [ nsigma-2 ] ) does not change if we force the index @xmath141 to be lower than @xmath142 , where @xmath68 is an arbitrarily small fixed parameter .",
    "this means that , @xmath143 , only states with energy smaller than @xmath144 contribute to @xmath65 . finally substituting @xmath145 with @xmath93 in equation ( [ fill2 ] )",
    ", we obtain an exact relation between @xmath93 and @xmath65 . in figure 4",
    "we checked that the numerical results for the comb graph presented in the previous section are perfectly reproduced by the exact calculation .",
    "the dashed - dotted line is obtained by first evaluating @xmath93 and then using equation ( [ fill2 ] ) to get @xmath146 .",
    "these data are very close both to @xmath63 ( filling of a small energy region around @xmath61 ) and to the theoretical value of @xmath65 .",
    "the classical bose - einstein condensates on homogeneous lattices present important large scale coherence properties due to the macroscopic filling of a single quantum state .",
    "one of the most effective ways to put into evidence this relevant feature of bec is the study of the long distance correlation function @xmath147 defined by : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the eigenvector of @xmath28 ( [ hamsr ] ) of eigenvalue @xmath150 . in particular , considering the correlation function between two sites at a macroscopic distance ( i.e. @xmath151 , @xmath12 is the radius of the van hove sphere ) , below the critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit we have : @xmath152 equation ( [ corrsingle ] ) shows that below @xmath54 there are @xmath153 particles in the ground state @xmath154 . on regular lattices ,",
    "the wave function of the ground state is constant and the correlation function at large distances does not depend on @xmath155 .",
    "in particular for the three dimensional case ( @xmath156 ) @xmath157 ; @xmath158 is the asymptotic number of particles of the condensate and @xmath159 is the normalizing factor given by the wave function @xmath154 .",
    "the large scale coherence properties of the bose - einstein condensate on a comb graph can be studied by calculating the correlation functions between the sites @xmath1 and @xmath160 of the backbone at a chemical distance @xmath161 , ( this way if the size of the macroscopic system is defined to be one , we are considering sites at distance @xmath162 ) .",
    "let us evaluate the contribution to ( [ correl ] ) of each single spectral region by using the exact wave functions @xmath163 of the pure hopping model on a finite @xmath164 periodic comb @xcite , with @xmath165 .",
    "for @xmath61 we have : @xmath166 @xmath167 does not depend on the distance between the sites since the wave function of the ground state is constant along the backbone . in ( [ corr0 ] )",
    "@xmath168 represents the filling of the state and @xmath169 is the normalizing factor of the wave function . in the low energy hidden spectrum",
    "we have : @xmath170^{-1 } \\sim { 1\\over(\\sqrt{2}l ) } \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty } { l^2 2 \\cos(2\\pi k d ) \\over \\sqrt{2 } \\beta t\\pi^2 k^2 + \\delta } \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for } \\",
    "\\ l\\to\\infty \\label{corrsigma-}\\ ] ] it should be noted that significant contribution to ( [ corrsigma- ] ) arise only from states with energy close to @xmath61 , similar to what happens in equation ( [ nsigma- ] ) . here",
    "the wave functions have macroscopical oscillations along the backbone and the filling of each state @xmath171 is multiplied by an oscillating factor @xmath172 .",
    "@xmath169 is again the normalizing factor of the wave functions . in @xmath111 and @xmath109",
    "we have @xmath173 , since in this case @xmath174 is an oscillating factor with diverging frequency giving rise to decoherence effects .",
    "the large scale correlation function for the pure hopping model is then : @xmath175 the two points correlation function diverges for @xmath85 , a well known property of localized condensates .",
    "notice that each state of the condensate provides a different oscillating contribution to ( [ corrcomb ] ) . in figure 5",
    "we plot the correlation function @xmath147 as a function of the distance @xmath162 .",
    "we can also evaluate the correlation function between two sites of the same finger . since all the states of macroscopic filling present the same behaviour along this direction ( an exponential decay depending on the distance from the backbone ) , in this case there are no interference effects and one obtains an expression analogous to ( [ corrsingle ] ) ( @xmath176 and @xmath177 represent the distance of the sites from the backbone ) : @xmath178 @xmath147 presents the diverging behaviour for @xmath85 typical of localized condensate .",
    "as we have seen , in an inhomogeneous structure the occurrence of bec does not imply the macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state . in this last section",
    "we prove the general condition for a bosonic hopping model on a graph to present condensation only on the lowest energy state .",
    "in particular we will show that in a model presenting bec at finite temperature ( i.e with a low energy hidden spectra or with a spectral dimension greater than 2 ) one has condensation on the single state @xmath61 if the spectrum @xmath30 satisfies the following spectral condition : @xmath179 where @xmath180 the symbol @xmath181 means that we are excluding from the sum the contribution given by the ground state .",
    "equation ( [ condsing ] ) has a clear mathematical interpretation .",
    "indeed as ( [ dens ] ) is the necessary condition for evaluating the thermodynamic limit of the average value of any bounded function @xmath182 as @xmath183 , ( [ condsing ] ) represents the condition to evaluate by an integral even unbounded functions diverging in @xmath61 as @xmath184 .",
    "the general result can be obtained writing equation ( [ eq1 ] ) as : @xmath185 where we set @xmath52 and @xmath186 is a generic energy between @xmath187 and @xmath188 the energy of the first excited state .",
    "let us now take in ( [ eq2 ] ) the thermodynamic limit @xmath189 .",
    "for the first term @xmath190 . for the second term",
    "we have : @xmath191 where we used the condition ( [ condsing ] ) .",
    "finally in the last term we let @xmath192 , obtaining : @xmath193 and this implies that only the lowest energy state has a macroscopic filling .",
    "the pure hopping model on the comb graph obviously does not satisfy ( [ condsing ] ) .",
    "notice that ( [ condsing ] ) is not a condition on @xmath30 , the density of states of the infinite structures , but a prescription on how @xmath25 tends to @xmath30 .",
    "the single state occupation then is determined by the behaviour of the model on each large but finite mesoscopic scale .",
    "in this paper we address the issue of bose - einstein condensation for a bosonic hopping model defined on the comb graph , a simple inhomogeneous discrete structure .",
    "such model is expected to describe the low coupling limit for a comb - shaped network of josephson junctions ( or , possibly , of optical traps confining non - interacting atoms ) , a realistic system which is currently being the subject of experimental research @xcite . in particular we show that the macroscopic occupation of the ground state , which is one of the distinctive features of bec on ( homogeneous ) euclidean lattices , is not sufficient for a complete description of the phenomenon on the comb lattice .",
    "indeed the inhomogeneity of the network forces the macroscopic occupation of a spectral region just above the ground state .",
    "this feature is strictly related to the presence of the so - called _ hidden regions _ in the spectrum of inhomogeneous structures such as the comb graph , and , as we discuss in section v , it is the cause of an anomalous behaviour of the large distance two point correlation functions .",
    "these results are obtained by exactly evaluating the states filling on mesoscopic combs , where the energy spectrum is nearly continuous , but the levels are still distinguishable , being related to wave - functions which differ on a large scale .",
    "the conditions restoring the standard feature of the bec , namely the macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state , are discussed as well .",
