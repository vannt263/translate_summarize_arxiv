    "there is recently a controversy between hartle , hawking , and turok on one side and vilenkin and linde on the other side on the sign of the action in the probabity density ( @xcite@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our calculation of the probability leads to the proposal of vilenkin and linde .",
    "there is another barrier in the region @xmath191 for the potential @xmath164 , as seen by fig .",

    "therefore , the probability density in the de sitter minisuperspace depends on the assumed value for the cosmological constant . from the above discussion",
    "we conclude that for a given value of the cosmological constant , the probability density in our model is much more than the probability density of the de sitter minisuperspace in 3space . therefore , the creation of a closed friedman universe with variable spatial dimension is much more probable than the creation of a closed de sitter universe in 3space .",
    "+ so in our model , the universe tunnels from the first turning point , @xmath205 to the second turning point , @xmath159 , expands up to the third turning point @xmath155 ( or @xmath206 for @xmath165 ) . it",
    "may then starts tunneling through the potential barrier in the region @xmath153 ( or @xmath206 ) . seeing the process classically , the point @xmath207 ( or @xmath206 ) may act as a turning point at which the universe begins to contract @xcite .",
    "the idea of the space dimension to be other than three is relatively old , at least since the work of kaluza and klein .",
    "but it seems that the variability of space dimension is a relative new idea .",
    "we accept it as a viable alternative and formulate a cosmological toy model based on a lagrangian to look for its consequences . in our formulation , there is a constraint and a scalar parameter , @xmath0 , accepting every positive value .",
    "the limiting case of @xmath1 corresponds to the standard model of constant space dimension . taking the present spatial dimension , @xmath16 , to be equal to 3 , and assuming the space dimension at the planck length , @xmath43 , to be about 3 , or one of the values of 4 , 10 , or 25 coming from the superstring theories , the corresponding values of @xmath0 are of the order @xmath208 , respectively . for @xmath209 as a fractal dimension for matter distribution in the universe , coming from cosmological considerations , we obtain different values of @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath210 3 , 4 , 10 or 25 .",
    "+ after a critical review of the previous works on the decrumpling universe model , we generalized the hawking ",
    "ellis action for the prefect fluid universe in 3space to the case of variable space dimension . using this generalized action for a perfect fluid",
    ", we have then formulated the action for a frw universe filled by a prefect fluid and allowing the space dimension to be a dynamical scalar variable .",
    "we have seen that this generalization is not unique .",
    "in contrast to the earlier works , we have taken into account the dependence of the measure of the integral on the spatial dimension .",
    "the lagrangian and the equations of motion and also the time evolution equation of the spatial dimension are then obtained .",
    "+ using the time evolution equation of the spatial dimension , we have obtained the classical turning points of our model universe .",
    "it turns out that the space dimension could have been up to infinity at the beginning of the expansion phase of the universe , where the universe has a minimum size equal to @xmath11 .",
    "this is the only singularity we encounter in our model .",
    "+ we then turn to quantum formulation of our toy model and write down the wheeler  de witt equation for our universe . imposing the appropriate boundary condition at @xmath211 and using the semicalssical approximation we have obtained the wave function of our model , which is real but more general than its standard counterparts . as a result , the hartle  hawking wave function is obtained for special values of the constant @xmath0 .",
    "other values of @xmath0 lead to a modified linde wave function . in the standard limit of constant space dimension",
    "we may have a general , hartle  hawking , or a modified linde wave function , but that of vilenkin is not obtained .",
    "this is due to the special shape of the potential which has always a second barrier for large scale factors and only vanishes in the limiting case of @xmath1 .",
    "we have therefore concluded that the vilenkin wave function is , in respect of varing the space dimension , structurally unstable .",
    "+ finally we have calculated the probability density for the potential barrier in small scale factor . in the limit of constant spatial dimension ,",
    "this probability density approaches to its corresponding value of the de sitter minisuperspace as suggested by vilenkin and linde . in general",
    ", the probabilty density for our toy model is larger than that of the standard quantum cosmology .",
    "+ our toy model shows that it is possible to formulate a lagrangian for a cosmological model with dynamical space dimension .",
    "it removes the usual singularities in physical quantities like scale factor of the universe because the minimum scale factor of the universe is @xmath11 .",
    "it gives us a model of how a probable space dimension of 10 or 25 at the planck length can be incorporated in the usual picture of @xmath212dimensional space time and what its consequences are .",
