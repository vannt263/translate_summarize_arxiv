    "massive young stellar clusters are ideal laboratories for research into the evolution of massive stars and their interaction with their surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "these luminous and rapidly evolving massive stars supply most of the young cluster uv radiation that creates the encompassing hii region and a large amount of mass and mechanical energy in the forms of supernova ejecta and stellar winds particularly during the wr phase .",
    "these massive starforming regions can eject during their first 10 myr of evolution about 20% of their initial mass @xcite ( hereinafter stb99 ) mostly in the form of newly synthesized c , n and o that by mass represent most of the heavy elements .",
    "massive young stellar clusters are ubiquitous particularly among late type galaxies",
    ". their stellar wind phase can result in a supergalactic wind affecting the nearby intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "it is open to question how the ejected freshly synthesized heavy elements cools and mix with the ism , and how long this process governed by the cooling time scale , may last .",
    "the time scale for cooling is strongly dependent on the gas cooling rate that in turn is dependent on the gas chemical composition and density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus evaluating the composition of the cluster ejecta and its time evolution is a necessary prior step for estimates of the evolution of the cooling function and the computation of cooling and feedback time scales .",
    "although work like that of @xcite underlined the large influence that the enrichment of the stellar ejecta can have on the radiative cooling of starburst superbubbles , many researchers are still using @xcite radiative cooling coefficient calculation for solar abundances when modelling the interaction between the stellar ejecta and their surrounding medium .",
    "in this paper we present a set of models designed to calculate in detail the first 20myr of the evolution and chemical composition of a star cluster ejecta on very short time scales , i.e. much shorter than the hii region lifetime and in particular to resolve the wr wind phase    galactic chemical evolution models traditionally assume that the elements ejected by the stellar cluster are incorporated to the ism when the corresponding stars die , i.e. at a time equal to their lifetimes @xcite .",
    "the shortest time step is usually defined by the mean - lifetime of the most massive star . since this is typically around 100120m@xmath2 , chemical evolution calculations begin normally at around 3 - 5myr with comparable time - steps .",
    "this way important phases of the wind evolution , occurring before 3myr or short lived like the wr phase are lost or diluted .    to compute the composition of the ejecta",
    ", most chemical evolution models use the total yields of elements due to supernova explosions , such as those given by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "ww95 ) or other more recent works @xcite to calculate the total change of the elemental abundances .",
    "other computations include the elements ejected during the wind phase of massive stars @xcite , only the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter pcb98 ) include the evolution of both phases , i.e. the yields of core collapse supernova explosions from @xcite and the stellar wind yields produced during the evolution of each star .",
    "however , pcb98 computations , as most chemical evolution models , were performed with time steps much longer than the lifetime of an hii region therefore missing short lived stages like the wr phase . moreover ,",
    "the evolution of a supernova progenitor that loses part or most of its mass is not the same as a normal main sequence massive star .",
    "since mass and structure are substantially different in he time of the supernova explosion , the associated yields will also differ , such as it is explained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter wlw93 and wlw95 , respectively ) . to take this into account",
    ", pcb98 linked the final stage of the star after lost mass with the supernova yields though the co core mass .",
    "however , they use the ww95 yields instead wlw93/wlw95 yields .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we use o and wr winds computations to estimate the evolution of the ejecta of a young massive stellar cluster . in section 3",
    "we compute the contribution of the explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "section 4 gives the complete evolution of elemental abundances within the cluster and discusses the impact of each contribution phase over the final ejecta .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "to compute the evolution of the rate of ejection of elements due to stellar winds of a single stellar population ( ssp ) of a given initial metallicity and initial mass function ( imf ) , we have used the tables resulting from the isochrones calculation by @xcite .",
    "these authors give the amount of mass lost by massive stars during their evolution for 7 initial stellar masses : 12 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 60 and 100m@xmath2 .",
    "for each initial mass and time step , the tables provide the present mass ( in solar mass units ) , the rate of mass loss in m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 ( logarithmic scale ) and the abundances of the stellar surface for h , @xmath6he , @xmath7c , @xmath8n , and @xmath9o .",
    "these tables are provided for 6 initial metallicities : z=0,0001 , 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 and 0.05 .",
    ".characteristics of the stellar models [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have computed the evolution of the total mass ejected and the elemental abundances of he , c , n and o for young stellar clusters of 10@xmath10 m@xmath2  for 6 imfs and for 6 different initial metallicities .    both stellar wind and supernova contribution to the ejecta are included in the computations . the supernova contribution",
    "include the classical gravitational collapse from @xcite for low mass progenitors plus the yields calculated by @xcite and @xcite for stars more massive than 30m@xmath2   and with z@xmath11 that reach the supernova stage after completely losing their h envelope .",
    "the abundances of the ejecta obtained by adding both contributions show important differences in comparison with the standard method which uses only supernovae yields without taking into account the stellar wind yields and/or the difference in the supernovae yields resulting from the huge mass loss affecting the pre - supernova evolution .    in particular :    * the composition of the ejected matter is determined mostly by supernova at low metallicities and by stellar winds at around solar metallicities . *",
    "the total mass ejected by stellar winds ranges from about 1% of the initial cluster mass for the lowest metallicity model to about 6% for the @xmath12  solar abundance ones of the total mass of the cluster for a salpeter imf . *",
    "the total mass ejected by supernova is @xmath125% of the total mass of the cluster for all initial metallicities .",
    "* at high metallicities the proportion of the mass ejected by the winds phase is around 40 - 60% of the total ejecta .",
    "* there is a large increase in the abundance of he , c , o and n after 2.5myr with o and c abundances being the most extreme .",
    "the o abundance jumps almost two orders of magnitude between 2.5 and 4myr in our lowest metallicity model and about 3 times for the solar abundance model . between 2 and 3myr ,",
    "the c abundance increases between 10 and 30 times its initial value depending on the initial abundance .",
    "* he and n show more moderate jumps than c and o in their abundance between 2.5 and 4myr .",
    "he abundance increases almost 3 times for the solar value models and about 2 times for z@xmath13 . on",
    "the other hand n shows jumps of about 5 times for all abundances . for cluster ages",
    "@xmath14 10 myr , he and n enrichment is mainly due to the stellar winds .",
    "these huge variations in the abundances of the ejecta of a stellar cluster can have a profound effect in the hydrodynamical evolution of the ism .",
    "the high metallicity of the young cluster ejecta will lead to extremely short cooling times with important consequences for the subsequent feedback .    on the other hand",
    ", one should keep in mind the main shortcomings and uncertainties of our models :    because present stellar evolutionary models with mass loss do not include the supernova phase and supernova models do not cover a range in initial abundances , our adopted values for the supernova yields of the most massive stars are only approximate .",
    "binary evolution is not considered .",
    "it is known that in young massive clusters perhaps all massive stars are in binary or multiple systems , but it is not clear how the presence of a companion would affect the properties of wind of a massive star .    the effect of stellar rotation is not included in the stellar evolution models we have used . again , as in the case of binaries , is not clear at this stage how rotation would affect the wind of a massive star .    in spite of these warnings",
    ", our models should be useful for the interpretation of the evolution of the ism in star forming galaxies .",
    "the resulting tables are available in electronic format .",
