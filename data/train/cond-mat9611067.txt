    ", the results obtained in early papers , mainly concentrated on the fibonacci  @xcite and the thue - morse  @xcite sequences , found a consistent explanation , since , resulting from the bounded fluctuations , a critical behaviour which resembles the periodic case was found for the ising model in two dimensions .    in the last years",

    "the prefactor @xmath24 is essentially constant in the vicinity of the critical point , and the temperature @xmath25 is normalized relatively to the unperturbed system critical temperature : @xmath26 . in the following , we will also use the notation @xmath27 . in order to obtain a dimensionless equation ,",

    "the discrepancy at larger values of @xmath104 suggests that the precision in the determination of the exponents has probably been overestimated , but the variation of the upper critical dimension with the perturbation amplitude is clear and should be attributed to an anisotropic scaling behaviour in the corresponding gaussian model .",
    "one can finally mention that a mean field approach for relevant aperiodic perturbations would be interesting .",
    "many cases of aperiodic sequences with a wandering exponent @xmath176 are known , they constitute relevant perturbations in mean field theory . in the case of the @xmath5 layered ising model with relevant perturbations , a behaviour which looks like random systems behaviour , with essential singularities , was found  @xcite , and the same type of situation can be expected within mean field approximation .",
