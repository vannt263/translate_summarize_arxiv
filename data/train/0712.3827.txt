    "it is generally known that continuous linear systems can not exhibit chaotic time evolution .",
    "however recently it has been shown that chaotic behavior can occur in systems without explicit non linearities .",
    "hirata et.al .",
    "@xcite have shown that continuous chaotic wave forms can be constructed by the superposition of certain pulse basis functions . in a linear second order filter driven by randomly polarized pulses , chaotic behavior is observed when the time series is viewed backwards in time @xcite .",
    "further they have shown that by reversing the time series , folded band chaos similar to rssler attractor can also be synthesized @xcite . even if the time reversal is not physical ,",
    "this reveals the importance of pure randomness which is associated with chaotic behavior .",
    "studies in this direction are important in understanding the relation between randomness , determinism and complexity in dynamical systems .",
    "we study a weakly damped driven linear oscillator where the oscillator and the drive are coupled only when the trajectory is in a thin strip in the phase space .",
    "this modification introduces strong nonlinearities required for chaotic behavior .",
    "first we consider the oscillator coupled to a deterministic drive .",
    "then we consider a random forcing .",
    "we show that the attractors formed by both the deterministic and random forcing are similar in many respects .",
    "the driven damped linear oscillator is well known and is important in almost all branches of physical science .",
    "the dynamics of this system satisfies the equation , @xmath0 the parameters in the equation are @xmath1 , the damping coefficient , @xmath2 , the angular frequency of the oscillator and @xmath3 the frequency of the drive .",
    "such a system shows periodic behavior after the initial transients have vanished .",
    "our basic model is the one in which the system is driven only in a thin strip of the phase space .",
    "we choose the origin as the location of the strip because orbits with lower energy may not encounter the strip , if it is located far from the origin .",
    "such orbits will spiral towards zero as in the case of an ordinary damped oscillator . when not driven , the oscillator performs a damped motion and the drive runs freely .",
    "first we consider a deterministic drive .",
    "the dynamics is characterized using standard techniques .",
    "also the behavior under parameter variations is studied .",
    "later we discuss the effect of replacing the deterministic driving term with a stochastic one .",
    "the equation [ driv_damp ] modified accordingly by the addition of a new term @xmath4 as , @xmath5 where , @xmath6 thus with a deterministic drive , what the dynamical equations represent is legitimate deterministic system in every sense .",
    "numerical simulations were done using the runge - kutta algorithm with a step size of @xmath7 .",
    "we choose the following values for the parameters : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters were chosen by numerical trials to express the concepts clearly , and are fixed during the evolution of the system in time .",
    "fig.[phspace ] shows the phase space plot of the system .",
    "note that there is a discontinuity in a strip of width @xmath13 near @xmath14 in the the phase space , where the oscillator is coupled to the drive .",
    "a closer view of the strip is given in fig . [ closeup ] .",
    "it can be seen that the trajectories that approach the origin may either cross the strip with or without considerable modifications , or it may get reversed .",
    "[ series ] shows the time series @xmath15 of the system .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations , and the number of    oscillations between two consecutive crossings of the strip are irregular .",
    "this corresponds to the phase space dynamics which consists of reflections in the strip and transitions which modify the trajectories .",
    "the power spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ pow ] is broad which confirms the aperiodic behavior in time . varying the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath16 , the system exhibits both chaotic and periodic oscillations . from the bifurcation diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ bifstrip ] and fig .",
    "[ bifgamma ] , it can be seen that the chaotic behavior disappears for higher values of @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "also note that for @xmath17 there is a transition to the case of an ordinary driven damped linear oscillator , where no chaotic behavior is expected .",
    "we used @xmath18",
    "@xcite for the analysis of the time series .",
    "the time delay required for reconstructing a timeseries is a widely discussed topic @xcite . with a delay of 1.56 ,",
    "it is found that the autocorrelation function falls to @xmath19 . with this delay",
    ", embedding dimension was calculated using false nearest neighbors method @xcite .",
    "it is found that the percentage of nearest neighbors approaches zero with embedding dimension 3 .",
    "lyapunov exponents were calculated with embedding dimension 3 , number of nearest neighbors 37 and degree of the extrapolating polynomial 3 .",
    "the obtained result is multiplied by the sampling frequency of the input signal to calculate the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent is found to be @xmath20 .",
    "we obtained 2.148 as the kaplan - yorke dimension .",
    "the reconstructed phase space of the attractor is shown in fig .",
    "[ recon ] and is similar in appearance to other chaotic systems .",
    "random forcing is achieved by the drive assuming a random value @xmath21 each time the phase space trajectory enters the strip .",
    "the amplitude of forcing @xmath21 is gaussian random variable with variance @xmath22 and zero mean .",
    "we define @xmath23 as follows , @xmath24 retaining @xmath4 defined as in eq . [ fliker ] for comparison ,",
    "the dynamical equation is , @xmath25      when the oscillator is driven randomly , it is found that the attractor is still chaotic with the largest lyapunov exponent equal to @xmath26 and a kaplan - yorke dimension of @xmath27 when embedded in three dimensions .",
    "the dynamics in phase space is similar to the one obtained with a deterministic drive as shown in fig .",
    "[ strip_xi ] .",
    "the reconstructed attractor ( with time delay @xmath28 ) given in fig .",
    "[ recon_xi ] is similar to the one obtained with a deterministic evolution .",
    "the effect of a forcing on the dynamics can depend on many factors .",
    "the most important are the amplitude and the time for which such a forcing persists . with eq .",
    "[ fliker ] the dynamics of the system in terms of phase space variables is well defined . the only degree of freedom available for an irregular behavior is through the time interval in which the system is driven and is not driven . at the onset of chaos , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ tau_ch ] that the durations for which the driving persists are highly irregular .",
    "also irregular are the intervals in which the system is not driven .",
    "this intermittent nature of the drive and irregular durations of the driving events are the only source of irregularities for a dynamics which is linear in every region of phase space . from fig .",
    "[ tau_xi ] , it can be seen that the random forcing applied to the oscillator also persists for irregular durations .",
    "stochasticity as such is a source for irregularities in a system .",
    "but it may not be the same as the topological structure of an attractor demands . there , the intermittent driving and irregular driving durations play a significant role .",
    "it modifies the irregularities associated with the driving suitable for chaotic dynamics in the system .",
    "the durations for which the system is not driven are also irregular in a similar manner .",
    "thus intermittency is significant to the chaotic behavior due to its role in synthesizing or seasoning the complexities that occur in the dynamics .",
    "the damped oscillator , together with its drive , have got another very fundamental similarity with deterministic chaos .",
    "the phase space of a chaotic system is dense in periodic orbits , or , it contains infinitely many periodic orbits .",
    "none of these periodic orbits are stable , but they significantly influence the evolution of a system in the phase space .",
    "this aspect is important in considering the anatomy of the chaotic behavior exhibited by the system under consideration .",
    "different periodicities arise due to different numbers of reflections and transmissions in the strip .",
    "the drive acts as the triggering mechanism for reflections or transmissions in the strip which facilitates smooth transitions between orbits of various periodicities .",
    "this is also the reason why the attractor structure remains similar under both deterministic and periodic drivings .",
    "though physically similar , two driving schemes are completely different in a mathematical sense .",
    "thus intermittently driven oscillator is an example where determinism can mimic stochasticity .",
    "a damped linear driven oscillator can exhibit chaotic behavior if the coupling between the drive and the oscillator are applied only at a narrow region of the phase space .",
    "similar chaotic behavior can be observed with a purely random forcing .",
    "though physically similar mechanisms exist for such a behavior , mathematically , they are different .",
    "we hope that this work has revealed yet another relation between randomness and determinism in nature .",
