    "positron emission tomography ( pet ) is a 3-d non - invasive technique that uses radioactive tracers to extract physiological information . like other low - photon counting applications ,",
    "the reconstructed image in pet scanners has low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , which can affect the diagnosis of disease through quantification of clinically relevant quantities such as standardized uptake value ( suv ) and metabolic lesion volume .",
    "therefore , a denoising mechanism for pet images has to be adopted as a preprocessing step for accurate quantification @xcite .",
    "current approaches in pet denoising are mostly inherited from optical imaging where primary criteria for denoising is qualitative rather than quantitative . among the effective methods derived from other biomedical imaging modalities , gaussian smoothing @xcite , anisotropic diffusion @xcite , non -",
    "local means @xcite , and bilateral filtering approaches @xcite either over - smooth the edges or violates the poisson statistics of the data ; hence , corrupting vital information .",
    "recently , multiscale denoising approaches such as @xcite and soft - thresholding methods @xcite have been adapted for pet images to avoid over - smoothing of the edges .",
    "these methods have shown improvement in snr compared to the conventional methods due to their superiority in preserving edges .",
    "however , multiscale methods do not perform well in the vicinity of weak boundaries because they fail to eliminate point - singularities . soft thresholding approach , on the other hand , is promising and shown to be superior to others since the noise is modeled in more realistic way and boundaries of small - sized objects are preserved ; however , optimal transformation of noise characteristics has not been addressed yet  @xcite .",
    "parametric denoising methods in the literature consider the noise in pet images to be additive gaussian  @xcite .",
    "however , gaussian assumption in pet images may result in the further loss of already poor resolution , increased blurring , and altered clinically relevant imaging markers .",
    "recent attempts such as @xcite used a more realistic poisson - distributed noise assumption in pet images where authors first `` gaussianize '' the poisson measurement followed by unbiased risk estimation based denoising filtering .",
    "gaussianization is achieved by applying a linear transformation such as a square - root and known as variance stabilizing transformation ( vst )  @xcite . however , the algebraic inverse vst used by this denoising method may be sub - optimal . regarding these difficulties",
    ", we proposed a novel approach in this paper to denoise pet images using the optimal noise characteristics and a 3-d structure preserving noise removal filtering .",
    "we consider the noise in pet images as a mixed distribution of poisson and gaussian .",
    "our assumption stems from the _ poisson _ nature of photon - counting and _ gaussian _ nature of the reconstruction process . in our proposed methodology ,",
    "a linear transformation ( i.e. , gat ) was first used to stabilize the noise variation optimally .",
    "second , trilateral denoising filter ( tdf ) was developed and applied to the variance stabilized image .",
    "finally , optimal exact unbiased inverse gat ( igat ) was applied to obtain denoised pet images .",
    "let @xmath0 be the observed voxel intensity obtained through the pet acquisition system .",
    "poisson - gaussian noise distribution models each observation as an independent random variable @xmath1 , sampled from poisson distribution with mean @xmath2 , and scaled by a constant @xmath3 , and corrupted by gaussian noise @xmath4 ( with mean @xmath5 and variance @xmath6 ) as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "+ a variance stabilization transformation ( gat ) assumes the existence of a function @xmath10 that can approximately stabilize the variation of @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) .",
    "mathematically , for the poisson - gaussian noise model @xmath13 , @xmath14 gives the optimal variance stabilization when @xmath10 is piecewise linear and having the following form  @xcite : @xmath15 note that gat equals to the traditional anscombe transformation when noise is considered poisson only ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "trilateral denoising filter ( tdf ) is an extension to bilateral filter , and similar to the bilateral filters , tdf belongs to an edge preserving gaussian filtering family .",
    "herein , we briefly describe the principal of tdf .",
    "let the gat transformed image @xmath14 be @xmath22 .",
    "a bilateral filter is an edge preserving filter defined as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an offset vector ( i.e. , defines a small neighborhood around the voxel @xmath25 ) .",
    "the weight parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively measure the geometric and photometric similarities within a predefined local neighborhood @xmath28 and are designed as gaussian kernels with standard deviations @xmath29 ( geometric range ) and @xmath30 ( photometric range ) , the size of the neighborhood is adjusted using @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "function @xmath31 is the normalization factor .",
    "a trilateral filter is a gradient preserving filter .",
    "it preserves the gradient by applying bilateral filter along the gradient plane .",
    "let @xmath32 be the gradient of the gat transformed image @xmath22 , the trilateral filter is initiated by applying a bilateral filter on @xmath32 , @xmath33 for refinement , subsequent second bilateral filter is applied using the @xmath34 . assuming @xmath35 and",
    "let a neighborhood weighting function be @xmath36 where @xmath37 specifies the size of adaptive region .",
    "ultimately , the final trilateral smoothed image is given as @xmath38 for tdf , @xmath29 ( geometric range ) is the only input parameter to trilateral filter , @xmath30 ( photometric range ) can be defined as ( see @xcite for the justifications ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the mean gradient of the gat transformed image .",
    "after obtaining the @xmath41 , we can treat the denoised data @xmath42 as the expected value @xmath43 .",
    "the closed form of optimal exact unbiased igat is given as , @xmath44 the optimal inverse @xmath45 ( in maximum likelihood sense ) is applied to the denoised data @xmath46 followed by scaling and translation ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) for obtaining the denoised pet image .",
    "we performed a comprehensive analysis and comparison of our approach with widely used denoising methods ( i ) gaussian filter , ( ii ) bilateral filter @xcite , ( iii ) anisotropic diffusion filter @xcite , and ( iv ) our presented trilateral filter ; without noise stabilization , with poisson noise stabilization ( vst , eq .",

    "a total of 36 reconstructions were completed consisting of 3 osem and 3 filtered back projection ( fbp ) reconstructions per scan . both osem and fbp images",

    "ct was performed primarily for attenuation correction with the following parameters : section thickness , 3 mm ; tube voltage , 120 kvp ; tube current , 26 mas ; field of view , @xmath49 mm .",

    "as pointed out with arrows , the boundary contrast is the highest in the proposed gat+tdf ; whereas other methods either over - smoothed or over - saturated the noisy areas .",

    "also vst+tdf result ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ) verifies that poisson noise assumption is more realistic than gaussian but suboptimal with respect to the poisson - gaussian assumption .    to evaluate the potential loss of resolution and enhanced blurring after the denoising procedure , we employed _ line profiling _ through lesion rois in phantom image ( shown in fig .",

    "superiority of gat+tdf can be readily depicted from the figure .    for quantitative evaluation of pet imaging markers",
