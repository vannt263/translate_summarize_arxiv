    "the recent direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) by the ligo collaboration @xcite is a turning point in the field opening the new era of gw astronomy .",
    "this result provoked both surprise and excitement not only on the researchers working with the generation of gws from astronomical objects but also of cosmological origin .",
    "the implications are promising because the weak interaction of the gws with matter will provide information previously unattainable like the physics of strong relativistic gravitational fields ( black holes coalescence ) , specific signatures from the very early universe ( much before cmb ) , and even tests of gravitational theories@xcite .",
    "potentially , cosmological gws will furnish new and powerful key for accessing the early universe physics and their current problems like the mystery related with the nature of the unknown components in the universe ( dark matter and dark energy ) .    in this concern ,",
    "the simplest explanation for the present accelerating stage of the observed universe is the existence of a dark energy ( de ) component , in addition to the cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xcite .",
    "observationally , the most accepted candidate for de is a rigid cosmological constant @xmath0 with energy density @xmath1 . at the level of general relativity ( gr ) and quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved spacetimes ,",
    "the @xmath0-term can be interpreted as a decoupled relativistic simple fluid ( vacuum medium ) obeying the equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the recent planck2015 results confirmed that the cosmic concordance model ( @xmath0cdm ) - a flat universe filled with cold dark matter ( cdm ) , baryons and a @xmath0-term - is in good agreement with the currently available cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "however , from the theoretical viewpoint , the unsettled situation in the particle physics / cosmology interface in which the cosmological upper bound ( @xmath3 ) differs from naive theoretical qft expectations ( @xmath4 ) by more than 100 orders of magnitude , originates an extreme fine - tuning problem , the so called cosmological constant problem @xcite . another unsolved mystery from first principles is why the vacuum energy density is so close to the matter energy density which is sometimes referred to as cosmic coincidence problem @xcite .    in order to alleviate the cosmological constant and coincidence problems , and also some mild tensions of the @xmath0cdm model @xcite",
    "many authors have proposed dynamical de models ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) . in general grounds , these models can also be implemented trough a time - evolving vacuum energy density coupled with the remaining cosmic components .",
    "theoretically , such models are suggested by the general form of the effective action in qft in curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "however , there are also some attempts to represent such @xmath0 models by a scalar field @xcite , a lagrangian description based on the so - called @xmath5 gravity where @xmath6 is the curvature scalar and @xmath7 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite . in such frameworks , different phenomenological decay laws for a time - dependent",
    "@xmath0 have also been proposed and their predictions confronted with the available observational data @xcite .    broadly speaking , the basic idea of a time - evolving @xmath0-term is quite simple .",
    "the vacuum eos implies that @xmath8 is constant only when the vacuum component is separately conserved .",
    "this is not the case when an interacting mixture is considered as in the present work . to be more specific ,",
    "consider the corresponding einstein field equations for a system formed by the interacting mixture ( matter plus the vacuum fluid ) with energy momentum tensors @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "since the einstein tensor @xmath11 is divergenceless , the total energy conservation law in the direction of the four - velocity , @xmath12 , reads :    @xmath13    where a frw geometry was assumed and in the last equality the vacuum eos was used ( see ( [ eq4 ] ) ) .",
    "note that the energy of the material component is not conserved independently .",
    "the running vacuum component is continuously transferring energy to the fluid component .",
    "of course , when the energy density of the vacuum medium becomes constant it does not contribute to the above balance equation for the material component .",
    "in other words , if @xmath14 is the constant ( bare ) @xmath15 , the energy of the material medium is separately conserved thereby recovering the standard result .    on the other hand",
    ", the recent ligo results are pressing the search on the production of relic gws ( tensor modes ) both at very low and high frequencies . in the observational front , the major challenge is the detection of the b - modes polarization anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) provoked by tensor fluctuations produced in the inflationary regime .",
    "the expected level of such anisotropies is small but presumably it will be accessed by the ongoing ( bicep and keck array experiments , south pole telescope , etc . ) and future probes through a new generation of high sensitivity instruments .",
    "one of them is the qu bolometric interferometer for cosmology ( quibic ) whose basic goal is to measure the b - modes at angular intermediate scales based on the innovative technological concept of bolometric interferometry ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in principle , the presence of a time - evolving @xmath0-term must effect the b - modes in comparison with the traditional @xmath0cdm plus the inflationary paradigm . as a consequence ,",
    "the influence of a dynamical vacuum on the adiabatic amplification of gws is a possibility that needs to be investigated .",
    "this is one of the main aims of the present paper . in this context",
    "we investigate here the production of primordial gws in the framework of a simple @xmath16 decaying vacuum cosmology that recovers the @xmath0cdm model as a particular case . the energy density and power spectrum are analytically derived .",
    "interestingly , unlike the cosmic concordance model ( @xmath0cdm ) , there exists adiabatic amplification of gws during the radiation epoch .",
    "as we shall see , such a result holds for generic decaying vacuum models and must remain valid for all analyzes based on realistic running vacuum cosmologies .",
    "let us now consider that the universe is well described by a flat frw geometry . in the co - moving coordinate system ,",
    "the background line element reads ( @xmath17 ) :    @xmath18    where the 3-space metric is @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are , respectively , the cosmic and conformal times , related by    @xmath23    the einstein field equations for a two - fluid mixture ( matter + vacuum ) is given by :    @xmath24    with @xmath25 and @xmath6 , being the ricci tensor and ricci scalar , respectively . the energy - momentum tensors ( matter and vacuum ) read :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are , respectively , the energy density , pressure and four - velocity of the fluid , whereas @xmath30 , is the vacuum energy density .",
    "the field equations in the above background take the form @xcite",
    "@xmath31    where a dot means derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath21 . in order to solve the above equation we need to know both the functional form of @xmath14 and the eos .",

    "based on dimensional arguments , carvalho _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite shown that a natural dependence is @xmath32 .",
    "later on , waga added the bare cosmological constant to this @xmath33 dependence studying some physical consequences of law @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a dimensionless free parameter @xcite .",
    "finally , such a functional dependence was derived within a renormalization group approach based on qft in curved spacetime by sol and shapiro @xcite .    in what follows , in order to discuss analytically some subtleties related to the decaying vacuum contribution for the stochastic background of gws , it will be assumed here that the phenomenological @xmath16-term is the one adopted by the above authors @xcite which is also a particular case of the class studied by the authors of refs .",

    "( [ eq5])-([eq8 ] ) , we find that the scale factor is driven by the following differential equation @xcite :    @xmath40    where we have introduced the convenient short notation    @xmath41    the case @xmath42 reduces to the standard @xmath0cdm equation for different eras . in the absence of @xmath15 ,",
    "the free @xmath35 parameter was first constrained long back ago based on big - bang nucleosynthesis studies to be @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "actually , it is even smaller when the constant vacuum term is also considered in the same decaying law ( @xmath44 ) @xcite .    in terms of the conformal time ( @xmath22 ) , the scale factor equation ( [ eq9 ] ) can be rewritten as ( see @xcite for @xmath42 ) :    @xmath45    where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "the last term in the above equation is negligible at early times .",
    "actually this happens for redshifts of the order of few . in this case , the general solution for the scale factor can be written as :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are integration constants .",
    "as usual , the solution for each era is specified by the corresponding value of @xmath38 , namely : inflation ( @xmath49 ) , radiation - vacuum ( @xmath50 ) and matter - vacuum ( @xmath51 ) . for each era we have also assumed that the vacuum decays only on the dominant component .",
    "note also that the early exponential inflation is not modified by the decaying vacuum since @xmath52 implies @xmath53 so that @xmath54 regardless of the values of @xmath35 ( see eqs .",

    "the values of the integration constants are    @xmath63    now we have a complete solution for the scale factor which depends on the parameter @xmath35 . in the special case of no decaying vacuum ( @xmath42 )",
    ", the quantity @xmath64 as given by ( [ delta ] ) reduces to the standard definition and all the expressions appearing in ref .",
    "@xcite are recovered . for future calculations",
    "it is important to estimate values of the transition times @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in order to do that ,",
    "let us compare the scale factors of different cosmological eras . comparing the scale factor at the present time @xmath65 with the scale factor at the end of inflation we have @xmath66 and for the end of the radiation era @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "using the solution for the scale factor ( [ scale factor lambda ] ) and solving the equations system we obtain that @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "although representing a crude approximation since the value of @xmath62 must depend on the @xmath35 parameter , throughout this paper we adopt this values .     as indicated in the figure . the expansion rate is faster for higher values of @xmath35 . ]    in the figure [ fig1:scalefactor ] we show schematically the behavior of the scale factor for some selected values of @xmath35 .",
    "as expected , for a given value of @xmath38 , the expansion grows faster for higher values of @xmath35 .",

    "it represents an harmonic oscillator with variable frequency determined by the evolution of the universe and describes different behaviors for the high and low frequency regimes ( with and without a vacuum component ) .",
    "once the solutions for @xmath95 for the different cosmic eras has been calculated , it is immediate to obtain the associated physical quantities like the wave amplitude , energy density and power spectrum .     for some values of @xmath35 .",

    "in this paper , by assuming a spatially flat geometry , we have investigated the production of gws for an interacting mixture of matter and vacuum in the context of gr .",
    "the dynamical @xmath0-term was described by a phenomenological law : @xmath195 , and a three stage description involving inflation , radiation and matter eras was adopted .",
    "it was also assumed that the vacuum decays only on the dominant component .    for each cosmic era",
    ", we have determined the general expressions for the scale factor ( in the conformal time ) , as well as the analytical solutions for the gw equation ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1:scalefactor ] , [ fig3:rad amplitude ] and [ fig4:mat amplitude ] ) .",
    "we notice that the mode function equations of the primordial gws were derived and explicitly solved for each era .",
    "more interesting , the corresponding power spectra and the energy density parameter for the radiation and matter era were also obtained ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5:power spectra ] and [ fig6:energy density spectra ] ) .",
    "obviously , exact solutions are allowed in this framework due to the simplified phenomenological form adopted for the decaying @xmath16-term .    in the present running vacuum model",
    ", the scale factor expands faster as long as the @xmath35 parameter increases thereby affecting considerably the production and evolution of the gw modes for both regimes - low and high frequency limits ( see figs .",
    "[ fig3:rad amplitude ] and [ fig4:mat amplitude ] ) .",
    "however , the most prominent feature is that the `` potential '' in the radiation era never vanishes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2:potential ] ) , even when very small values of the @xmath35 parameter are adopted . as a consequence , unlike models with no decaying vacuum ( @xmath42 ) , the gws in the radiation era can be adiabatically amplified ( in the sense of grishchuk @xcite ) .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "it is different from the standard parker s result @xcite claiming that in relativistic cosmology there is no gravitationally induced quantum production of particles due the cosmic expansion in the the frw radiation phase ( for a similar result outside of gr see @xcite .",
    "it is closely related with the fact that during the radiation phase @xmath196 in the presence of a decaying vacuum component .",
    "on the other hand , our expressions for the modulus of the gw amplitude @xmath197 shown us that the adiabatic amplification ( graviton production ) , is a low - frequency phenomenon even for this kind of @xmath16 cosmologies .",
    "this interesting and known feature is also maintained in the present context even considering that gw are produced in the radiation phase .",
    "here as there , the basic problem is that at the high frequency regime the cosmic expansion dominates , and , therefore , the perturbations are dynamically suppressed in the course of the expansion .",
    "this behavior is also reproduced in the power spectrum due @xmath198 . however , in the case of the energy density parameter spectrum , @xmath199 , the behavior is different due to the contribution of @xmath194 .    finally , we stress that the present work was based on a very simple decaying vacuum cosmology .",
    "it played the role of a toy model for obtaining analytically some basic information , like the production of gws during the radiation phase .",
    "its consequences on the b - modes polarization of cmb anisotropies it will discussed in a forthcoming communication . as it appears , the model can be thought as a starting point for the investigation of more complex and rich decaying vacuum cosmologies , like the one proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and recently , investigated in a more enlarged framework in refs .",
    "although less analytical regarding the calculations involving gws , such models deserve a closer scrutiny since they furnish a complete cosmological history .",
    "the generating mechanism of the primordial gws is believed to have a quantum mechanical origin .",
    "the basic idea is that quantum fluctuations of the vacuum state in the early universe were stretched to macroscopic scales due the cosmic inflation thereby originating the present observable primordial gw spectrum .",
    "the standard quantization procedure is based on a semi - classical approach where the perturbations are quantized but the gravitational background evolves classically ( for details see the review of giovannini @xcite ) .",
    "when the perturbations are quantized on a classical background , the functions @xmath78 e @xmath79 in ( [ hij ] ) are promoted to be quantum creation and annihilation operators which satisfy equal time commutation relations ( @xmath200 )      the vacuum state @xmath202 is defined for a given time @xmath22 and mode @xmath203 . in general",
    "does not exist an unique vacuum state because if for some time @xmath204 the vacuum state is @xmath205 , for another time @xmath206 it changes to @xmath207 . for an expanding background ,",
    "the vacuum state at time @xmath204 is different from the vacuum state at @xmath206 .",
    "this so - called vacuum state ambiguity has some interesting consequences , the most prominent of them being the gravitationally - induced particle production ( ` grishchuk particles ' ) . to be more precise , by assuming that there is no particles at time @xmath204 , that is , @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the number operator acting in the vacuum state [ @xmath210 ( the polarization and wave number index were suppressed for simplicity ) ] .",
    "later on , at a time @xmath206 we have @xmath211 , but the vacuum state ambiguity gives @xmath212 . consequently the vacuum state @xmath213 contains ",
    "@xmath214 \" particles and vice versa . this is the physical foundation for the creation of ` grishchuk gravitons ' induced by the cosmic expansion ."
