    "the relative distribution of galaxies and mass is of increasing concern in cosmology .",
    "constraints on cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys are only as accurate as our understanding of bias . furthermore ,",
    "if the density parameter in mass that is capable of clustering were shown to be @xmath4 then most dynamical analyses of the motions of galaxies would be consistent with the assumption that galaxies trace mass , and the challenge would be to explain why simulations of the adiabatic cold dark matter ( cdm ) model for structure formation typically indicate galaxies are more strongly clustered than mass ( jenkins 1998 ) . if @xmath5 , galaxies do not trace mass and it would be puzzling that the mass autocorrelation function in cdm simulations is a much poorer approximation to a power law on scales @xmath6 than is the galaxy two - point correlation function , and that the mass function shows a much more pronounced evolution of shape back to @xmath7 ( jenkins 1998 ) .",
    "major surveys in progress of galaxies and the cosmic microwave background ( the cmb ) will advance our understanding of such issues",
    ". it may be useful to supplement these observations with analytic illustrations of how biasing can evolve as mass clustering grows and gravity draws together the galaxies with the mass .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to present a simple analytic model for the dynamical evolution of the relative distribution of galaxies and mass .",
    "we assume that at formation a galaxy may be assigned a near permanent observational tag .",
    "the far infrared luminosity would not do , for iras galaxies avoid dense regions , an example of biasing due to environment ( , strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "the spheroid luminosity may be an adequate tag , for the spheroid star populations in more luminous galaxies are thought to be old and slowly evolving .",
    "we let @xmath8 be the density of this luminous matter and @xmath9 be the total mass density , both smoothed on some appropriate scale @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding density fluctuations are @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in a commonly used model @xmath13 , where the constant @xmath0 is the bias factor .",
    "we adopt the more general and possibly more realistic statistical representation of dekel & lahav ( 1998 ; dekel 1997  5.5 ; lahav 1996  3.1 ) where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are treated as stationary ( translationally invariant ) random processes that may be grouped in the two - dimensional vector ( ) . the mean @xmath16 vanishes by definition .",
    "we write the covariance matrix as = ^2 (    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]       the time - evolution of bias ( a ) and correlation ( b ) for some of the models in table 1 .",
    "the randomness contribution @xmath17 to the correlation @xmath1 depends on @xmath18 , which is a measure of the memory of fluctuations @xmath19 at the same comoving position at different times .",
    "if memory were complete , @xmath19 a function of position alone , then @xmath20 . in the limit of a short coherence time ,",
    "@xmath21 , gives @xmath22 , just as the average of @xmath23 independent fluctuations is proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "the simple two - parameter model s = s_*_0 incorporates both of these extremes as special cases ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) , and since this aspect of the galaxy formation process is still so poorly understood a more complicated model for @xmath27 does not yet seem warranted .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 can be interpreted as the effective number of uncorrelated galaxy formation epochs .",
    "the current rms mass contrast is @xmath28 , and the other model parameter is the relative normalization @xmath29 .",
    "examples of these relations are listed in table 1 and plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the growth factors @xmath30 for the low density models are computed as in carroll ( 1992 ) .",
    "these models show that the biasing parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 can vary quite rapidly near the start of galaxy formation , and that @xmath1 and @xmath0 tend to unity even if galaxy formation never ends , as in models 4 and 5 , because the growth of gravitational clustering debiases the growing number of older galaxies . after galaxy formation terminates @xmath0 and @xmath1 approach unity more rapidly , evolving as in figure 1 .",
    "a random component @xmath19 produces a large early value of @xmath0 , but @xmath0 and @xmath1 approach unity quite rapidly if @xmath31 , as the fluctuations from large numbers of random events average down to insignificant levels .",
    "we have computed the evolution of the bias factor @xmath0 and the mass - galaxy correlation coefficient @xmath1 in a simple analytic model represented by a galaxy formation history @xmath32 , the parameters in a representation of biased galaxy formation ( @xmath33 , @xmath29 , and @xmath23 ) , and the parameters for the cosmological model ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "galaxy formation could be affected by explosions , as from quasars , at positions unrelated to the local mass density ( , dekel & rees 1987 ; babul & white 1991 ) .",
    "this effect is represented by the term @xmath19 .",
    "the coherence time of @xmath19 , as measured by @xmath23 , would depend on how long individual quasars last and how long the intergalactic medium `` remembers '' their effects .",
    "the complications of luminosity evolution and galaxy mergers are incorporated into our formalism by defining @xmath32 to be the formation history of the matter that is luminous at the redshift @xmath36 at which we wish to evaluate @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if galaxies were assembled at @xmath37 there could be a large and observationally significant evolution of the biasing functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 at low redshift , as illustrated by the steep initial slopes in figure  2 .",
    "on the other hand , if galaxy positions were assigned at relatively high redshift the effect of biasing at birth would be strongly suppressed . decreasing the mass density @xmath34 decreases this effect , because the growth of density perturbations at low redshifts is slower , but this likely is at least partially canceled by shift of the formation epoch to larger redshifts .",
    "in fact , if @xmath38 , @xmath33 , and @xmath19 were functions of @xmath39 alone , debiasing would be independent of the cosmology .",
    "the new galaxy redshift surveys , including the two degree field ( 2df ) survey and the sloan digital sky survey , have the potential to measure key cosmological parameters with great accuracy , both alone ( tegmark 1997 ; goldberg & strauss 1998 ) , and when combined with cosmic microwave background experiments ( hu 1997 ) . to achieve this , however , biasing and its evolution must be understood to a comparable accuracy .",
    "our formalism deals with the second moments of the mass and galaxy distributions in a universe that is statistically homogeneous ( eq .  [ [ pdefeq2 ] ] ) .",
    "the trend to debiasing of the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 in this representation appears to be a generic feature of the gravitational instability scenario for structure formation , a prediction that may be observationally tested in the near future as galaxy redshift surveys improve .",
    "we thank ben bromley and ue - li pen for useful discussions .",
