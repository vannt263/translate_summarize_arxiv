    "supergravity can be obtained as a low energy field theory approximation of string theory @xcite .",
    "the leading order correction to this theory depends on the string used to obtain the low energy effective field theory expansion . in the heterotic string theory ,",
    "the lowest corrections are described by a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known from the renormalization group flow that the constants depend on the scale at which a theory is probed @xcite .",
    "so , we expect that the different constants in general relativity and gb gravity also depend on the scale at which these theories are measured . the renormalization group flow for supergravity solutions @xcite and gb gravity @xcite has been analyzed .",
    "in fact , a renormalization group flow has been used for measuring the flow of the cosmological constant @xcite and newton constant @xcite .",
    "now , as the scale at which a theory is measured depends on the energy of the probe , it is expected that these constants will also depend on the energy .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will use gravity s rainbow @xcite for analyzing gb black holes with the energy dependent constants .",
    "it may be noted that the initial motivation of gravity s rainbow came by analyzing the target space metric of string theory .",
    "this was done by regarding string theory as a two dimensional theory , and considering the target space metric as a matrix of coupling constants . then using renormalization group flow ,",
    "this matrix of coupling constants would flow and depend on the scale at which this theory is measured .",
    "this would in turn make them dependent on the energy that is used for probing this theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the geometry would also be energy dependent .",
    "such a modification of a geometry at high energy scale can be viewed as a uv completion .",
    "it may be noted that just like the horava - lifshitz gravity horavaprd , horavaprl , the gravity s rainbow @xcite , has also been viewed as a uv completion of general relativity .",
    "this is because both of these approaches are based on a modification of the usual energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit .",
    "such a modification of the usual energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit occurs in a large number of approaches to quantum gravity , such as the discrete spacetime @xcite , models based on string field theory @xcite , spacetime foam ellis , spin - network in loop quantum gravity @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite and ghost condensation @xcite . it may be noted that even the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin limit ( gzk limit ) suggests that the usual energy - momentum relation could get modified in the uv limit @xcite .",

    "different lifshitz scaling for space and time have also been used for analyzing certain aspects of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that for a suitable choice of the rainbow functions , the horava - lifshitz gravity can be related to the gravity s rainbow garattini .",
    "this is because both of these approaches are based on a modification of general relativity in the uv limit such that the general relativity is obtained in the ir limit .",
    "basically , horava - lifshitz gravity has been used to study the uv completion of various interesting geometries .",
    "motivated by the close relation between the gravity s rainbow and horava - lifshitz gravity , the uv completion of many black hole solutions has been recently obtained by using the formalism of gravity s rainbow ali341    one of the most interesting effects of the uv completion of geometries is the modification of the black hole thermodynamics at the last stage of the evaporation of the black holes .",
    "as the gravity s rainbow reduces to the general relativity in the ir limit , the black hole thermodynamics in gravity s rainbow reduces to the usual black hole thermodynamics for very large black holes .",
    "however , as the black holes evaporate and reduce in size , the black hole thermodynamics in gravity s rainbow showing deviation from the usual black hole thermodynamics .",
    "this deviation becomes significant at the end stage of the evaporation of black hole in gravity s rainbow ali104040 .",
    "it has been observed that the temperature of black holes reaches a maximum value , and then it starts to reduce beyond this maximum value . at a critical value",
    "the temperature of black holes becomes zero , and the black holes do not radiate hawking radiation at that stage .",
    "so , a black hole remnant forms in gravity s rainbow .",
    "this formation of a black hole remnant has important phenomenological consequences for the detection of mini black holes at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it is known that the usual uncertainty principle has to be modified to the generalized uncertainty principle to have an upper bound on the energy of a particle . as this",
    "particle acts as a probe for the geometry of the black hole , it also fixes the energy scale of the gravity s rainbow .",
    "thus , this bound on the energy of a particle emitted in the hawking radiation can be used as energy scale in the rainbow functions .",
    "this modifies the thermodynamics of black holes ali104040,hpemrainbow .",
    "such a modification in the black hole thermodynamics has also been observed for black rings @xcite .",
    "the temperature of black rings also reaches a maximum value and reduces beyond that value to form a remnant .",
    "it has been argued that a remnant will form for all black objects @xcite .",
    "this has been explicitly demonstrated for kerr black holes , kerr - newman black holes in de sitter space , charged anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes , higher dimensional kerr - ads black holes and black saturn @xcite .",

    "the effect of gravity s rainbow on the thermodynamics of black holes in gb gravity coupled to maxwell s theory has been studied @xcite . in this analysis , it was observed that even though the thermodynamics of the black holes get modified in the gb gravity s rainbow , the first law of thermodynamics still holds for this modified thermodynamics .",
    "however , in this analysis , different constants were not made to depend on the energy of the probe .",
    "as we expect the constant to depend on the energy of the probe , in this paper , we will generalize this analysis and make the constants energy dependant .",
    "we will also investigate the critical behavior of black hole solutions in this theory .",
    "it may be noted that the pressure - volume ( pv ) criticality has been studied for black holes in gb gravity using extended phase space thermodynamics @xcite . in the extended phase space thermodynamics",
    ", the cosmological constant is viewed as a thermodynamic pressure , and so it is possible to define a thermodynamic volume conjugate to this thermodynamic pressure @xcite . it has been observed that along with the usual black hole phase transition , a new phenomenon of reentrant phase transitions occurs for rotating ads black holes in extended phase space @xcite . in these reentrant phase transitions a monotonic variation of the temperature yields two phase transitions , and this situation is similar to that which is seen in multi - component liquids . the pv criticality has also been studied in quasi - topological gravity @xcite . in this paper , we study the effect of the uv completion of general relativity on the pv criticality in extended phase space .",
    "also , we analyze the effects of rainbow functions on pv criticality in gb gravity s rainbow . in addition , we analyze the effect of energy dependent constants on thermodynamic properties of black hole solutions .",
    "we also study the effects of such modification on the critical values and van der waals like behavior of the system .",
    "as it was mentioned before , we expect that all the constants depend on the energy of the probe .",
    "such a dependency of the constants on the energy of the probe can be explicitly analyzed using gravity s rainbow .",
    "this is an advantage of using the gravity s rainbow .",
    "now , following earlier work on einstein - gb - maxwell black holes in gravity s rainbow , we will generalize solutions to the case where different constants are dependent on the energy of the probe .",
    "our first step is analyzing the effect of this energy dependency on the field equations .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional action of gb - maxwell gravity with negative cosmological constant can be written as @xmath1 ,   \\label{action}\\]]where @xmath2 and we set @xmath3 and @xmath4 in which the last one is the so - called gb coefficient . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider positive values of gb coefficient .",

    "calculations show that there is a curvature singularity at @xmath23 , which can be covered with an event horizon .",
    "hence , it will be interesting to see the effects of the gravity s rainbow on the singularity and asymptotical behavior of the solutions . in order to study these effects ,",
    "we use series expansion of the kretschmann scalar for small and large values of radial coordinate . by doing so",

    "\\label{leff}\\ ] ]    interestingly , the obtained relations indicate that the rainbow functions affect the strength of singularity as well as asymptotical behavior of the solutions . in other words ,",
    "the asymptotical behavior of the solutions is ads with an effective cosmological constant , @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that the gb parameter and rainbow function can modify @xmath27 .",
    "it means that @xmath27 reduces to @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , simultaneously .",
    "now , we are in a position to study thermodynamical quantities of the solutions . using the concept of the surface gravity ,",
    "it is a matter of calculation to obtain temperature as @xmath31 r_{+}^{2d}-2q^{2}d_{3}^{2}h_{1}^{4}(e ) h_{3}^{2}(e ) g^{2}(e ) f^{2}(e ) r_{+}^{8}}{4\\pi d_{2}\\left ( r_{+}^{2}+2\\alpha ^{\\prime } h_{4}^{2}(e ) g^{2}(e ) \\right ) g(e)f(e)r_{+}^{2d_{-1/2}}}.   \\label{tnew}\\ ] ]    one of the conditions for having physical solutions is imposed by positive temperature . since we have considered positive values of gb parameter , the denominator of the temperature is always positive and only numerator has contribution to negativity of the solutions . for ads black holes , only charge term in numerator of the temperature",
    "contribute to negativity of it .",
    "taking closer look at the numerator , one can see that energy dependency of constants plays a crucial role in domination of different terms .",
    "therefore , the conditions for having physical solutions ( positive temperature ) is highly sensitive to energy variation of different constants .",
    "since we are working in the context of higher derivative gravity , it is not allowed to use the area law for calculating entropy .",
    "we use the wald formula with the following result @xmath32    in addition , the total electric charge of the solutions is obtained through the use of gauss s law as @xmath33    for the electric potential , we have @xmath34    the total mass of the black holes could be obtained through counter - term method or the arnowitt - deser - misner approach with the following unique form @xmath35where by evaluating metric function on outer horizon , one can find total finite mass as @xmath36 r_{+}^{d_{5}}+q^{2}d_{1}d_{3}h_{1}^{4}(e)h_{3}^{2}(e)g^{2}(e)f^{2}(e)r_{+}^{-2d_{2}}% } { 8\\pi d_{1}f(e)g^{d_{1}}(e)}.   \\label{mnew}\\ ] ]    before we proceed , it is worthwhile to mention a few remarks about conserved and thermodynamical quantities .",
    "the modification of gb gravity when the constants are not energy dependent has already been analyzed @xcite .",
    "thermodynamical quantities of the solutions in @xcite differ from those obtained here which highlights the effects of dependency of constants on the probe energy .",
    "especially , the electric potential was shown to be independent of energy function in ref .",
    "@xcite , while here , it depends on the energy of the probe . strictly speaking ,",
    "these two types of black holes are phenomenologically different .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that most of constants in physics are not actually constant . in fact",
    ", a measurement of their expectation values leads to the result that they should be varying parameters . here",
    ", we have taken such consideration into account and shown that thermodynamically speaking , black holes will be modified in such consideration .",
    "now , we are in a position to check the validation of the first law of black hole s thermodynamics . using total mass of these black holes ( [ mnew ] ) with the obtained entropy ( [ snew ] ) and electric charge ( [ qnew ] ) as extensive parameters",
    ", one can define following intensive parameters    @xmath37    where by evaluating these equations , one can confirm that the obtained temperature and electric potential in eq .",
    "( [ tu ] ) coincide with those extracted from eqs .",
    "( [ tnew ] ) and ( [ unew ] ) . therefore , despite the modifications in thermodynamical quantities by consideration of energy dependant constants , the first law of thermodynamics is valid for these black holes .",
    "the extended phase space expression comes from consideration of the cosmological constant not as a fixed quantity but a thermodynamical variable which is known as pressure .",
    "although thermodynamical pressure is generally proportional to the negative cosmological constant with a proportionality constant @xmath38 , there are some cases in which we should modify it @xcite . in this paper , it is observed that the metric function and asymptotical behavior of the system have been modified due to the existence of rainbow functions .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to check the possible effects of rainbow functions on thermodynamical pressure . to do so , we evaluate the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the following relations for different components of energy - momentum tensor @xmath39@xmath40    in these relations , the first term is due to the existence of electromagnetic field ( which is coupled with rainbow functions ) .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath28 term is not coupled with any rainbow functions of the metric . in other words , although rainbow functions of the metric modify @xmath28 term in the metric function and asymptotical behavior of the solutions , they do not affect thermodynamical pressure which is related to the cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , in studying the critical behavior of the system through the analogy between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , one can use following relation @xmath43    thermodynamically speaking , the conjugating thermodynamical variable corresponding to the pressure is thermodynamical volume which in the context of enthalpy is calculated by @xmath44    it is worthwhile to mention that in order to have a well - defined vacuum solution with @xmath45 , the pressure @xmath42 has to satisfy the following constraint @xcite @xmath46 in which it puts a restriction on the pressure as maximal pressure @xmath47which indicates that only for sufficiently small pressures , the solution ( [ metric function ] ) has an asymptotic ads region .",
    "now , remembering that we are working in extended phase space , the total mass of the black holes will not play the role of internal energy .",
    "instead , it is interpreted as enthalpy . with this consideration",
    ", one can find the gibbs free energy as @xmath48    as for the volume of these black holes , by using eqs .",
    "( [ mnew ] ) , ( pnew ) and ( [ v ] ) , we obtain @xmath49 which is modified in the presence of the rainbow functions .",
    "in other words , in the presence of gravity s rainbow , thermodynamical volume of the black holes is a function of the rainbow functions , and therefore , the final form of these black holes is determined by the model of rainbow functions under consideration . on the other hand , even by consideration of the dependency of different constants on the probe energy ,",
    "the volume of these black holes is same as that of probe energy independent constants .",
    "this behavior is expected , since the abstract form of metric ( [ metric ] ) is free of any constant .",

( [ pvcnew ] ) indicates that consideration of the gravity s rainbow can modify this near universal ratio . interestingly , for neutral solutions ( @xmath60 ) , the critical pressure is independent of metric s rainbow functions while the critical horizon radius and the critical temperature are functions of one of rainbow functions .",

    "this emphasizes the fact that thermodynamical structure of the charged black holes in gravity s rainbow is completely different from the neutral ones .",
    "the critical horizon radius must be real valued and positive .",
