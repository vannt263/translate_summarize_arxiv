    "the aim of this note is to establish a new link between discrete geometry and classical concepts in topology . configurations of vectors can be understood with the help of grassmannian manifolds equipped with a stratification controlled by matroids @xcite .",
    "similarly , affine configurations yield stratified grassmannians whose structure is determined by affine oriented matroids .",
    "the decomposition provided by schubert cells of a grassmannian has striking equivalent formulations in terms of convex polyhedra and of matroids @xcite .",
    "affine analogues of these results have been pursued in @xcite , where the focus there lies in understanding the combinatorics of these polyhedral structures .",
    "we will show that the topology of based loops of certain affine configurations can be explained using braids .",
    "a braid should be thought of as a system of @xmath0 strings which do not intersect and have fixed start and end points .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath5 , respectively . consider a smooth embedding @xmath6 of an interval @xmath7 into @xmath5 such that @xmath8 lies in @xmath1 and @xmath9 in @xmath2 .",
    "denote by @xmath10 a collection of @xmath0 such embeddings @xmath6 , each one starting from a distict point in @xmath1 and ending in a distinct point in @xmath2 , such that the projection to the @xmath11 coordinate is decreasing as @xmath12 runs from @xmath13 to @xmath14 in @xmath7 .",
    "we also require that @xmath15 for every @xmath16 in @xmath7 and @xmath17 , which means we obtain disjoint images and the strings do not intersect .",
    "* definition * _ a braid @xmath18 is an isotopy class of a @xmath10 as described above .",
    "_    braids form a group @xmath19 @xcite and each braid @xmath18 permutes the order of @xmath1 to a new order in @xmath2 .",
    "when this order remains unchanged , i.e. the permutation is trivial , we say @xmath18 is a _ pure _ braid .",
    "it is easy to see that pure braids form a subgroup @xmath20 .",
    "the fundamental group of the space of @xmath0-tuples of distinct points in the plane is isomorphic to the pure braid group @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the centre of @xmath21 is the infinite cyclic group @xmath22 , generated by the element @xmath23 .",
    "the spaces of affine configurations of flats in affine and projective spaces were defined in @xcite .",
    "following the same notation we consider @xmath24 , the space of distinct @xmath25 , oriented @xmath26 affine classes of sets of @xmath0 points in the real affine plane . for simplicity we will refer to this space as @xmath27 .",
    "* theorem  1 . * _ for @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "_    this can be seen as a variation of the classical result about the configurations of distinct points in the plane and the pure braid group mentioned above .",
    "it allows results from braid groups to be translated into results about affine configurations .",
    "for example , the conjugacy problem for braids is solvable @xcite , therefore the isomorphism above implies that the conjugacy problem for homotopy classes of based loops of oriented affine configurations in the plane is also solvable . in principle",
    "there exists an algorithm to decide whether or not two such loops are conjugate .",
    "suppose @xmath30 is a topological space and let @xmath31 denote the group of self - homemorphisms of @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be the subgroups which consist of homeomorphisms which are isotopic to the identity and those which preserve orientation , respectively .",
    "define the _ pure mapping class group _ of @xmath30 as @xmath34 .",
    "the group @xmath21 is isomorphic to the pure mapping class group of the disk @xmath35 minus @xmath0 points @xcite , we can now establish another isomorphism . from theorem 4.5 in @xcite",
    "it follows that the pure mapping class group of the sphere @xmath36 with @xmath37 punctures is @xmath38 .",
    "therefore we obtain for @xmath39 ,    * corollary  2 . * _ the fundamental group of @xmath27 is isomorphic to the pure mapping class group of the sphere @xmath36 punctured @xmath37 times .",
    "_    we will show that the group @xmath40 is isomorphic to a free group with eleven generators .",
    "this can be seen by using the combinatorial decomposition of the affine configuration spaces , as outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "notice that the configuration space @xmath41 consists of a single point .",
    "* acknowledgements : * the author thanks luis montejano peimbert for his guidance and encouragement , and is also grateful to francisco gonzalez acua , mario eudave muoz and raymond lickorish for useful conversations and for pointing out subtle details in previous versions .",
    "let @xmath42 be the affine span of the set @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "define @xmath45    in other words , we are considering the sets of @xmath0 points in @xmath46 which are not all co - linear and hence span the real plane affinely .",
    "the group @xmath47 of orientation preserving affine transformations of @xmath48 acts freely on @xmath49 .",
    "we denote the quotient of @xmath50 under this action by @xmath51 , in @xcite it is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "we call @xmath27 the space of oriented affine configurations of @xmath53 distinct points in the real plane .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath54 is a principal fibre bundle .",
    "take @xmath64 , for @xmath65 $ ] to be a representative of @xmath61 .",
    "then the path @xmath66 rotates the plane by one whole turn , and hence also rotates the points @xmath67 by one whole turn .",
    "therefore @xmath66 is identified with @xmath68 under the classical identification of @xmath69 with @xmath21 , where @xmath68 is the generator of the centre @xmath22 of the pure braid group @xmath21 .",
    "this implies , @xmath70 we now claim that for @xmath28 the fundamental group of @xmath50 is isomorphic to the pure braid group @xmath21 .",
    "consider the smooth inclusion @xmath71 , and note that both @xmath50 and @xmath72 are smooth submanifolds of @xmath73 , because they are the complements of a collection of closed subspaces of codimension @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath50 is a smooth submanifold of @xmath72 .",
    "similarly @xmath75 is a smooth inclusion .",
    "we will show that the complement of @xmath50 in @xmath72 has dimension @xmath76 .",
    "the claim @xmath77 will follow from the general fact that when a smooth submanifold @xmath78 of dimension @xmath53 in a smooth manifold @xmath79 of dimension @xmath80 , with @xmath81 then the inclusion @xmath82 induces an isomorphism on the fundamental groups @xmath83 so that @xmath84 .",
    "notice @xmath72 is an open subset of @xmath73 , which means @xmath85 .",
    "an element of @xmath86 is a @xmath0-tuple of points @xmath87 , all of which lie on the same line in @xmath48 .",
    "first we will use the real projective plane @xmath88 minus a point to parametrise free lines in @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the plane @xmath90 , for @xmath91\\in { \\bf r}p^2 $ ] consider the plane through the origin which is normal to @xmath92 and call it @xmath93 .",
    "denote the intersection @xmath94 by @xmath95 , then @xmath91\\mapsto l'$ ] is the homeomorphism that parametrises free lines in @xmath48 by elements of @xmath88 minus the element corresponding to the @xmath11 axis ( and @xmath96 ) .",
    "since the @xmath0-tuple @xmath97 is allowed to move freely within the line @xmath92 , it can be described as an open subset of @xmath98 .",
    "hence @xmath99 , and we are left with @xmath100 . which implies that @xmath101 when @xmath28 .            in @xcite",
    "it was shown that @xmath105 is homeomorphic to @xmath88 .",
    "taking the double orientation covering we can see @xmath106 is homeomorphic to @xmath36 and it has the polyhedral structure of the truncated cube .",
    "then @xmath107 , which in the notation of @xcite is @xmath108 , is homeomorphic to @xmath36 minus the vertices of the truncated cube . because these vertices correspond to configurations where two points @xmath109 and @xmath110 coincide , i.e. @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "hence @xmath107 is homeomorphic to @xmath36 minus 12 points , which correspond to the vertices of the truncated cube .",
    "therefore the fundamental group of @xmath107 is isomorphic to the free group generated by 11 elements .",
