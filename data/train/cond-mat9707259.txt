    "protein folding is one of the most challenging problems in molecular biology , and many theoretical models have been proposed , aimed to explain the thermodynamics as well as the kinetics of this process .",
    "it is experimentally known  @xcite that a protein , under proper solvent and temperature conditions , folds from a denatured random - shaped state to its `` native '' state , which is characterized only by the amino acid sequence ( `` the primary structure '' ) , and does not depend on the initial state",
    ".    the experimental data for the folding process support the so - called `` molten - globule '' picture  @xcite : folding of small single - domained proteins in proper solvent conditions would start with a rapid collapse from a coil state to a compact one , which is not unique , but is in metastable equilibrium with several other compact states .",
    "the protein would appear at this point as a molten globule , not presenting a definite shape .",
    "the latter diffuses among the various conformations until it finds its way across the free - energy barrier ( probably unique ) separating it from the most stable ( native ) state , and eventually would reach the native state .",
    "because of the cooperativity of the process , folding appears from a thermodynamical point of view as an all - or - none transition , similar to a first - order phase transition in infinite systems @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the physics involved in protein folding has greatly profited by ideas and techniques coming from statistical mechanics of disordered systems and random energy models ( r.e.m . )",
    "@xcite . as far as thermodynamics is concerned ,",
    "the number and the complexity of interactions in which residues are involved , as well as the fact that functionally similar proteins may have somewhat different sequences ( for instance , lysozymes of different species ) , have suggested to approach the folding problem by means of an analogy with r.e.m .",
    "analytic results @xcite predict a glass - transition when the probability distribution of the couplings is broad enough ( that is , when the residues behaves very differently from one another ) .",
    "several studies have been carried out on short model heteropolymers on a lattice ( both with random and with specified interactions ) , where a preliminary complete enumeration always allows us to find the energy of any configuration .",
    "these studies have revealed some important requirements that a sequence should fulfil in order to be a good folder ( gap in the spectrum , non - degeneracy of the ground state @xcite , particular values of the ratio between collapse and folding temperatures @xcite ) .",
    "debate is still open on the relative importance of these properties for characterizing good sequences @xcite .",
    "however , what the analysis has assessed is that these requirements are not typical of random sequences , so that a true protein can not be considered a random heteropolymer , as long as the feature of being able to fold to a stable and unique native state is concerned .",
    "lattice models have also been employed to study the kinetic aspects of the folding process @xcite , under the hypothesis that they do not depend on microscopic details of the dynamics .",
    "one still gets thus meaningful results when using fictitious monte carlo dynamics instead of the true one ( which , of course , can not be easily implemented on a lattice ) .",
    "the above assumption seems reasonable , since the predictions of various diffusive regimes and relaxation times , that come out of these studies , are in good qualitative agreement with phenomenology @xcite . besides",
    ", these works have revealed that kinetic accessibility of the native state from a generic initial condition is as important as the already mentioned thermodynamical requirements , for a sequence to be a good folder . as a consequence",
    ", it is commonly believed that real proteins present a rough but funnel - shaped free - energy landscape , which provides an overall bias towards the native state @xcite .",
    "however , the success of simple lattice models also states their limits .",
    "the results obtained so far constitute an increasing evidence of the fact that proteins are very peculiar heteropolymers @xcite : far from being random , they present an `` energy - landscape '' with correlated minima , and a native state which has probably been selected to be the ground state of the highest number of sequences ( to face the risk of mutations ) and to be kinetically accessible from all initial configurations of the chain . the role played by local contacs along the chain ( the secondary structure ) , which had been disregarded by rem , is now coming again strongly to attention , as it seems to be crucial for rapid folding and resistance against mutations @xcite .",
    "simple heteropolymer models on a lattice are not well suited to deal with this kind of features , and the only way to improve our knowledge within this scheme would be that of making simulations with longer chains : this is clearly unfeasible , as the only way to find the native state relies on a complete enumerations of all compact configurations of the polymer , whose number grows exponentially with the number of residues .",
    "the need for an exhaustive enumeration comes from the fact that chain connectedness is responsible for a strong frustration of a generic polymer , so that the energy landscape is rugged , and states of the same energy ( but very different in shape ) may be found anywhere , asking for a complete searching of the configuration space .",
    "real proteins circumvent this problem when folding to the native state , since they are provided with a sequence which , given the geometrical constraints of connectedness and microscopic steric hindrance to be fulfilled , encodes the smallest frustration , and the smoothest energy landscape ( essentially , this is the statement of the `` principle of minimal frustration '' @xcite )    the problem with lattice models comes from the fact that we do not know _ a - priori _ , given the constraints of lattice geometry ( intrinsically different from the natural ones ) , which sequences of what hydrophobic charges correspond to the smoothest landscapes , and the only way to find it out consists in a exhaustive numerical analysis of the entire configuration space , since no definite hints can be provided by real proteins",
    ".    the situation would greatly improve with a model directly related to the real systems , such that a mapping would exist between protein and model configurations . in this case , a direct comparison of the ground state with true native one would be possible , and one could check the goodness of the model by direct inspection .    in this paper , we present a model which , in a coarse - grained way , allows us to deal with any chosen sequence of any lenght . such model is based on a description of the protein chain in terms of pieces of helices , implying that the building blocks are indeed the elements of the protein secondary structure , which have an `` internal energy '' related to ramachandran s maps and mutually interact according to the mean `` charge '' they contain .",
    "the hamiltonian we obtain is realistic , yet quite complicated , just because of its generality .",
    "however , simplified models can be extracted from it and studied independently , and the results can be compared to real native states .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec - mod ] we define the model , discussing the various terms in the hamiltonian , in sec .",
    "[ sec - simpmod ] we derive a simplified model and calculate its ground state and partial partition function ; in sec .  [ sec - conc ] , we briefly summarize and comment our results .",
    "we start from the observation that accurate studies of the phenomenology reveal a number of common features of the native states of the majority of simple , single ",
    "domain proteins :    * the native state is organized hierarchically in secondary , supersecondary , and tertiary structures .",
    "typical elements of the secondary structure are @xmath0helices , @xmath1strands and tight  turns ; supersecondary rules tell us how these elements pack together locally ( prescribing , for instance , the right - handedness of @xmath1x@xmath1 units ) , while the tertiary structure refers to the way the above mentioned elements are arranged in space . as a general remark",
    ", one can say that `` pieces of secondary structure that are adjacent in the sequence are also often in contact in three dimensions '' @xcite ; knots in the chain seem also to be generally forbidden ; * the native state is highly compact , with the non  polar residues buried on the inside , in order to minimize their contact with the solvent .",
    "the urge to protect the hydrophobic residues from water is believed to be the leading factor in the folding process : the secondary and supersecondary structures would emerge in order to accomodate in the best way the hydrophobic core , with the minimal frustration of local interactions ; * the periodicity of the helices tends to mimick that of the sequence , when there is one .",
    "it is known , for instance , that @xmath0helices on the surface of the protein s native state usually present an external side , exposed to the solvent , with polar residues , while the other one is hydrophobic ; * the partial success of structure identification methods , based on the analysis of the homologies between sequences , suggests that , even though the folding process is dominated by hydrophobic interactions , local properties pose serious constraints on the final structure , and somewhat limit the number of possible choices .    for the above reasons , we aim to construct a model able to handle both the local and the global aspects of the main chain geometry ( disregarding side - chain configurations ) .",
    "one way to cope with the two contrasting requirements of a coarse  grained `` effective '' modelling of the interactions , and of a good control of the local constraints imposed by steric hindrance and chain connectedness , is to think of the protein as made up by pieces of different helices , linked together one after the other .",
    "this picture is general enough to describe probably all the relevant conformations of a protein : it is built having in mind the above - mentioned features of native states , but it may also represent chains in coil conformations , when many small helices are present , with random orientation . for the consistency of this approach , we shall approximate with a helix a part of the protein at least three peptide units long ; shorter helices will not be allowed .",
    "since a perfect helix involves repetition of a fixed dihedral angle ( @xmath2 ) at each peptide unit , this approximation may appear to be somewhat crude when there is a strong local variability of the above variables , as it happens in loops and turns .",
    "however , this is not a major problem , because a tight turn can be fairly well represented by a short piece of regular helix , and the shortness implies that only a small error in the energy is introduced .",
    "the same holds true for any `` coil '' region of the chain , which may be partitioned and treated in the same way .",
    "the helices are described by their radius and pitch , their lenght , and the orientation of a reference frame attached to each of them , which specifies the direction of their axis .",
    "we shall see later that these are not the most useful variables to introduce in the hamiltonian , but we start with them for the sake of simplicity .    the equation of the curve representing the protein chain is assumed to be : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a continuous variable parametrizing the curve points , and ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , the total number of residues ; @xmath7 is the limit for @xmath8 of the function @xmath9 which represents a `` barrier '' : @xmath10 is a function of the variable @xmath4 designed in such a way that in the limit @xmath8 it becomes a step function .",
    "for instance one could choose @xmath11 whereby @xmath12 , and @xmath13    the @xmath14 are the helices expressed in their reference frame ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 +   { \\bf h}_{i-1}(s_{i-1 } ) \\;\\;\\ ; , \\label{hel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] labeled so that helix i starts at @xmath17 and ends at @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the total number of helices , residues are labeled from 1 to @xmath6 , and the convention holds that a residue sitting at the junction between two helices belongs to the first of them .",
    "we will name from now on @xmath22 the lenght of helix @xmath23 .",
    "we choose u_i = _ i , [ u ] where l is the lenght of a peptide unit ( the distance between two neighboring @xmath0-carbon atoms ) , so that the line element on each helix is @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the sign @xmath25 of @xmath26 positive for right - handed and negative for left - handed helices , while the product @xmath27 is always positive .",
    "we also ask that helices have the same lenght of the piece of chain they represent : this may be done by requiring that @xmath28 when we move along the protein chain of one peptide unit : in this way the above defined @xmath29 coincides with the number of residues in the secondary structure element that the helix describes .",
    "we see that six scalar variables are needed to specify a helix : they are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and three euler rotation angles relating the helix reference frame to the fixed `` laboratory '' one . for an infinite helix ,",
    "the radius @xmath30 , the pitch @xmath31 and the angular parameter @xmath26 are related to curvature @xmath32 and torsion @xmath33 in a straightforward way : @xmath34    obviously curvature and torsion are the natural candidates to appear in the local part of the hamiltonian , which will take into account the stiffness of the chain and the steric hindrance of the residues .",
    "one is therefore led to study the form of curvature and torsion of the curve in eq.([chain ] ) .",
    "after some lengthy but straightforward manipulations , remembering that @xmath35 and taking into account only the leading terms in the limit @xmath8 , one finds that these quantities have the form of a sum involving curvatures and torsions of the various helices in the chain , plus some terms coming from the regions near each junction , depending only on the two neighboring helices .",
    "for instance we obtain for the curvature ( see appendix  [ app1 ] ) : @xmath36 where dots indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath4 , and @xmath37 are respectively dirac delta and heaviside theta functions .",
    "we see that the relevant quantity at the interface is the scalar product @xmath38 between the right and the left limit in @xmath39 of the tangent vectors .",
    "similar results hold for the torsion , as well as for any other quantity obtained by algebraic operations on curvature and torsion .",
    "the fact that it is possible to reduce the expressions of curvature and torsion of the whole chain to sums of the corresponding quantities for each helix , plus `` interface terms '' depending only on nearby elements , suggests that also the hamiltonian may be built as a sum of `` local '' single - helix terms with next - neighbour interactions , accounting for the stiffness of the chain .",
    "in addition to these , a third , non - local term , will describe the interactions between non - neighbouring helices .",
    "therefore we write : @xmath40    the protein sequence will come into play in the last term , because the interaction between helices obviously depends on the residues they are made of , but will also have a role in the first one , as helices are preferred if they present the same local periodicity as the sequence .",
    "the explicit form of the hamiltonian will be discussed in section  [ secham ] ; in the next one , we introduce a formalism allowing us to treat conveniently the non - local term , which is awkward to handle in the variables that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ chain ] ) and ( [ hel ] ) .      in order to specify the position and the kind of each helix",
    ", we introduce the following variables :    ccll n_h & & & + n_i&=&s_i - s_i-1 & ( n_i ) + l_i&=&(s_i + s_i-1 + 1 ) & ( l_i ) + * v*_i&=&_i(s_i ) - * h*_i(s_i-1 ) & + * b*_i&=&(*h*_i(s_i ) + * h*_i(s_i-1 ) ) &    [ dyva ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , since a helix can not be defined with less than three residues ; @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 $ ] . in the above equations @xmath29 is the lenght of the @xmath23-th helix expressed in residues ;",
    "@xmath45 $ ] ; @xmath46 represents the position along the sequence of the center of the @xmath23-th helix ; @xmath47 is the vector joining the end - points of helix @xmath14 ; it is the geometrical analogue of @xmath29 ; @xmath48 is the the spatial position of the middle point of @xmath47 .",
    "two other variables , related to curvature and torsion , are needed to completely specify the characteristics of a helix : a useful choice , which will allow us to write a realistic potential in a simple form ( see section  [ sec - hi ] below ) , is to introduce : z_i & = & , + [ z ] w_i & = & u_i - 2 ( -u_i ) , [ w ] where @xmath26 has been defined in eq .",
    "( [ ahu ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath49 ranges between 0 and 1 , while @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the definition of @xmath51 allows us to remove the discontinuity between right and left - handed helices at @xmath52 , which is model - induced but inevitable in a description of the chain in term of helices .",
    "a chain in such a conformation , where there are exactly two residues per turn , may be regarded as both left - handed and right - handed , and a little deformation can bring to the one or the other type of configuration ; yet there is no continuous operation that trasforms a right - handed helix into a left - handed one .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that one abruptly passes from @xmath53 to @xmath54 while smoothly deforming the chain .",
    "the above variables specify how the chain is partitioned into helices and is embedded in three - dimensional space , providing a sequence - independent formalism .",
    "the sequence enters the model through new variables @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 . the former are related to the nature of each residue @xmath58 , and measure its coupling to the other residues . in the following",
    "we shall refer to li and coworkers  @xcite who write the mijazawa - jernigan interaction matrix @xcite as : m _",
    "= _ 0 + _ 1 ( q_+ q _ ) + _ 2 q_q _ ( , = 1  20 ) [ mijemx ] ( a slight change of notation is performed here with respect to the original paper ) .",
    "this equation can be recast as : m _",
    "= q_+ q_+ ( q_- q_)^2 [ mijemx2 ] with q_=_0/2 + _ 1 q_+ ( _ 2/2 ) q_^2 . [ q ] the authors show that @xmath59 correlates well with the hydrophobicity of the residues ; for this reason we can call it `` the hydrophobic charge '' of aminoacid @xmath60 .",
    "since we deal with entire helices at a time , and not with single residues , we shall introduce the average @xmath61 of a helix , centered in @xmath62 , as ( l ) = [ qbar ] ( integer or half - integer values of @xmath63 are the only ones allowed for the central points of the helices , @xmath46 ; the variable @xmath64 is an arbitrary number , comparable with the mean lenght of the helices ) .",
    "the corresponding values for the hydrophobic charge @xmath65 are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) with @xmath61 replaced by @xmath66 .",
    "notice that this is the correct way of evaluating @xmath65 , since it is easy to show that the average interaction between @xmath67 residues on a helix and @xmath68 on another is given by : & = & 1n_1n_2_i=1^n_1_j=1^n_2m_ij= 1n_1n_2= + & = & _ 0+_1 ( _ 1+_2 ) + _ 2_1_2 , and hence is naturally written as a function of the average @xmath69 and @xmath70 on the helices .",
    "+ the other variables are related to the local periodicity of the sequence , and are defined in the following way . considering a generic helix of lenght @xmath71 , centered at the point @xmath63 along the sequence , the quantity : @xmath72 { \\bf e}_{1 } + \\sin[w ( l+k ) ] { \\bf e}_{2 }   \\right)\\ ] ] is the projection , on the plane perpendicular to the helix axis , of the `` hydrophobic dipole moment '' calculated at a point on the axis , and normalized with respect to the total charge @xmath73 ( for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we take @xmath63 to be an integer in these equations ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath74 reveals the prevalence of non polar residues on one side of the helix , characterized by the periodicity @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , in sec .",
    "[ sec - hi ] we shall write a local hamiltonian depending explicitly on _ ^2(l , w , n ) = _ j , k =- n^n q_l+j q_l+k ( ( j - k ) w ) , [ pquad ] and favouring configurations which maximize @xmath76 .",
    "the dinamical variables previously defined are not completely independent from each other , and the following constraints hold :    1",
    ".   the sum of the residues of all the helices must be equal to the total lenght of the chain : _",
    "i=1^n_h n_i - n = 0 [ vinc0 ] 2 .",
    "the lenght of the end - to - end vector @xmath77 is related to the lenght and shape of the helix : _",
    "i^2 - | * h*_i(s_i ) - * h*_i(s_i-1 )    @xmath78 ; 3 .",
    "the end of one helix must coincide with the beginning of the following one , both in sequence and in space : _ i - * b*_i-1 - & = & 0 , [ vinc2 ] + l_i - l_i-1 - & = & 0 .",
    "[ vinc3 ]    in these equations , @xmath23 ranges from 1 to @xmath21 , and , to be consistent with the definitions of @xmath46 , we set @xmath79 , @xmath80 .    from the above discussion the following picture emerges : we describe the geometric shape of the protein by the variables @xmath81 ; besides , we give the sequence of `` charges '' @xmath55 which represent its residues .",
    "notice that the above variables do not specify completely the position of the helices in space , because , when the constrains are satisfied , there is still a complete degeneracy for rotations of each helix @xmath14 around the vector @xmath47 .",
    "actually , given a chain conformation , only one of these degenerate configurations , which are indistinguishable in our scheme , corresponds to it .",
    "therefore , provided we choose a good criterion to identify helices out of real chain conformations , we have that any protein configuration can be mapped in exactly one model configuration",
    ".    we may ask if the converse is also true : considering a given a model helix , specified by the variables @xmath82,@xmath75,@xmath83,@xmath84 , with its end points pinned at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , we see that :    * many chain conformations , slightly different from one another , correspond to it , since real helices are not made up by an exact repetition of dihedral angles ; anyway , we assume we can consider these to be represented by the same geometrical helix ; * it s quite unlikely that two ( or more ) real helices , with shape and lenght well described by the above variables , but corresponding to different degenerate positions around vector @xmath87 , may exist ; * it could be possible , on the other hand , that no real helix with the above parameters could fit between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , due to the stiffness of the chain at those points .    if case c holds , troubles arise , since forbidden chain configurations could appear as allowed model ones .    in the following",
    ", we shall make the assumption that , given a model helix ( of lenght @xmath90 ) , with its end - points at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , it is always possible to replace it with the corresponding real chain helix , in such a way that no relevant perturbation is introduced in the total energy of the protein .",
    "this is reasonable , since small adjustements of the chain , out of a perfectly regular configuration ( yet not affecting its overall helical shape ) , can intervene and prevent forbidden joint conformations , thus reducing the energetic penalty to a small fraction of the total energy .",
    "we shall come back to the discussion of the energy contributions from the helix junctions in the next section , where we discuss the explicit form of the hamiltonian .",
    "two terms will contribute to the internal energy of a helix : the first one , @xmath92 , is purely geometric , and takes into account the experimental ramachandran plot to dictate which kind of helices are more likely to be formed .",
    "the second one , @xmath93 , on which we commented above , is sequence dependent , and acts as an external field , biasing the helices towards a certain periodicity .",
    "it is important to notice that , if proteins were made by a sequence of exact repetitions of the same @xmath94 angles , the association of a geometrical helix to each part of the chain would be straightforward and the geometrical quantities @xmath95 of the helix could be written as functions of @xmath94 : \\ {    rcl ( ) & = & ( s_2 ) c ( , ) , + z & = & ,    . [ inv ] where we have defined : @xmath96 and use the explicit expressions c ( , ) & = & a ( ) + b ( ) , + s_2 & = & c ( ) + d ( ) , ( see appendix  [ app2 ] for details ) .",
    "the mapping @xmath97 in the above equations is two - to - one , as can be seen from the study of the solutions of the fourth degree polynomial equations involved in the inversion of eqs.([inv ] ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath94 provide a complete description of the geometry , specifying not only the position of the @xmath98 atoms , but also the orientation of the peptide planes , which have been disregarded in our approach .",
    "dealing with real proteins implies that each helix is associated to a portion of chain where a certain amount of irregularity in @xmath94 is inevitable .",
    "this has no practical consequences when the irregulaties are small and the dihedral angles are clustered around a particular position ( which happens for long elements of secondary structure ) .",
    "however , for short coil regions with a great variability in the dihedrals , it would be quite artificial to relate the best fitting values of @xmath95 to an hypothetical @xmath94 repeating couple .",
    "it is clear that in the latter case the relationship between @xmath99 and @xmath94 is weakened .",
    "for this reason we shall make the simplifying assumption that @xmath100 can be assumed as fundamental variables , and that the helix - model configurations are in a one - to - one relationship with them . since @xmath101-couples that can not correspond to any real protein configuration are introduced by this ansatz , we shall write the hamiltonian @xmath102 in such a way that these values have a vanishing weight in the evaluation of the partition function .    the choice of an explicit expression for the hamiltonian requires a careful analysis , because no reliable potential function based on first principles is known .",
    "this is not surprising , if one thinks that each residue is itself a many - body system , usually in interaction with the solvent molecules . on the other hand , the fact that even a crude hard - sphere model for a dipeptide reproduces the experimental ramachandran s maps in an essentially correct way ( compare for instance fig .",
    "( 12a , 13a ) in ramachandran s article  @xcite with fig .",
    "( 5 ) in morris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , implies that a simplified description of the potential function should be possible , and suggests its main characteristics .",
    "we already mentioned the fact that , even in the case a perfect helical - shaped chain , the variables @xmath75 , @xmath83 give a description of the chain geometry which is less detailed than that provided by @xmath94 angles , and even more so in comparison with an all - atom description . despite this , it is possible to write a potential function in the variables @xmath75 , @xmath83 which correctly reproduces the main features of the ramachandran s plots , in the form h_i^0 = ( n_i-1 ) _ 0 .",
    "[ hi0 ] here the @xmath103 s are fixed adimensional constants ; the factor @xmath104 takes into account the feature that each residue in the helix feels the same potential , except the last one , which corresponds to the junction with the following helix , and must be treated in a different way . in figs.([figv4wz],[figv4fipsi ] ) we plotted the contour lines of this potential , with @xmath105 , respectively as a function of @xmath75 , @xmath83 , and of their images on the @xmath94 plane .    note",
    "that , since @xmath106 , there is nearly symmetry under the exchange of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , so that there is an intrinsic difficulty in distinguishing the region above from that below the diagonal @xmath109 by means of the quantities at the right member of eq.([inv ] ) .",
    "this can be considered a minor problem , since the physically allowed region roughly coincides with that above the diagonal @xmath109 and we aim to study , as a first approach , only the behaviour of a system which presents two energy minima roughly corresponding to the @xmath0- and @xmath1-regions of ramachandran s map ( as a consequence , we disregard left - handed @xmath0-helices , since a residue in that position usually belongs to a turn , and not to an actual left - handed helix ) .",
    "+ the above _ ad hoc _ hamiltonian provides a correct qualitative description of the phenomenological results , without introducing expressions more complicated than a fourth degree polynomial . in the following",
    "we shall consider it as an unperturbed hamiltonian , to which the non local - interactions add as perturbations , which remove its degeneracy without affecting its overall shape in plane @xmath94 .",
    "coming to the sequence dependent part of the local hamiltonian , a very natural choice is that of taking h_i^1 = -_1 n_i p(l_i , w_i ) , [ hi1 ] where @xmath110 is an appropriate dimensional constant , and @xmath111 is some simple function of @xmath112 .",
    "for instance @xmath113 could be either the average of @xmath76 calculated for different accessible lenghts of the helices ( the values of @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ pquad ] ) ) , or @xmath76 itself , evaluated with a particular phenomenological mean value of @xmath82 .    a more detailed study on the best expression for @xmath114 is left to future work on the subject : in the following , we shall choose a particular form for @xmath114 only when , in section [ sec - simpmod ] , we shall study the ground state of hamiltonian eq.([hi1 ] ) for a small synthetic protein , showing that @xmath115 can indeed provide partial information about the native state .",
    "so far we have disregarded the contributions to the energy coming from the aminoacids at the junctions between helices : they have been kept out from eq.([hi0 ] ) thanks to the factor @xmath104 .",
    "when we try to keep them into account , we immediately face many difficulties , since there is apparently no natural way to relate exactly the microscopic potential determining the possible @xmath94 values to the description of the chain in terms of helices .",
    "we saw in eq.([chaink ] ) that , at the junctions between helices , the curvature depends on the scalar product of the right and left limits of tangent vectors in those points .",
    "this would suggest to write an interaction penalizing discontinuities in the tangent vector ; yet , this is quite awkward for the following reasons :    * while it is possible to relate curvature and torsion of a helix to the dihedral angles specifing the chain , it is extremely complex to do the same for the scalar product @xmath117 : the knowledge of @xmath94 at the the junction is not sufficient to specify the direction of the tangent vectors ( remember that the @xmath118 atoms of the chain do not even lie on the helices , due to the requirement that lenghts be the same when measured along the ( continuous ) helices or the ( discrete ) chain ) ; * even if it were possible to find a mapping , relating the dihedral angles at the junction to the helix geometrical description , in terms of tangent vectors , uncontrollable mistakes would be done in evaluating the energy .",
    "in fact , real helix junctions are different from ideal ones , since structural adjustments are allowed in real chains to minimize the energetic cost of the junction which can not be described by ideal chain geometry , where helices are stiff .",
    "hence , if we are interested in a reasonable estimate of the energy , a detailed description of the tangent vectors dependence on the @xmath94 angles at the junction is essentially useless . *",
    "finally , tangent vectors are very difficult to write down within the adopted formalism ( because of the degeneracy under rotations , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - dynvar ] , even if we do nt relate them to real chain quantities",
    ".    therefore , we have to write down an expression for the interaction energy between neighbouring helices without relating it to the real chain geometry , and without resorting to tangent vectors .",
    "the natural candidates to appear in such an expression are , of course , the vectors @xmath47 , @xmath119 , but the functional form to be chosen is by no means obvious .    in principle",
    "one could study first the total energy of two successive secondary structure elements ( for instance , by looking at dihedral angles and applying microscopic potentials ) as it comes out from phenomenology , then represent such elements with model helices , and finally get the interaction energy as the difference between the total and the sum of the single helices. it would be possible , in this way , to relate the interaction energy to the relative positions of @xmath47 and @xmath119 .",
    "yet , as a first approach , we assume this energy to be a costant , at each junction , regardless of the values of the dynamical variables : for instance , we can take the mean energy of the residues calculated with the ramachandran s map distribution .",
    "since @xmath120 is the number of junctions , we set : h_nn = _ 2 ( n_h-1 ) .",
    "[ hnn ] this simple hypothesis entails an important effect : if one neglects the sequence  dependent hamiltonian @xmath121 and the non local interactions , splitting up a helix in two pieces with the same @xmath99 as the former one involves the substitution of a residue of energy @xmath122 with a residue of mean energy @xmath123 .",
    "hence helix breaking will be penalized for helices with `` good '' values of @xmath99 ( @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-strands , for instance ) , and favoured in the opposite case .",
    "this is very important , because both entropic effects and non - local interactions , as we shall see below , would favour configurations with many short helices , regardless of @xmath99 values : @xmath124 competes with the above effects , allowing , in principle , the existence of equilibrium states of the model presenting long elements of secondary structure .",
    "the modeling of non - local interactions requires a careful analysis of their nature and characteristics .",
    "two different contributions are to be dealt with : hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions .",
    "the former are responsible of orientational preferences of the couplings between elements of the secondary structure , but are believed to play an insignificant role as a driving force for folding , since hydrogen bonds to solvent are of the same energy than intramolecular ones .",
    "the latter are responsible for the collapse of the chain to globular states , but are very difficult to model , since they come mostly from entropic effects invoving the solvent , and not from a true coupling between residues . for these reasons ,",
    "we abandon the idea of writing non - local interactions on the grounds of microscopic considerations , and once more resort to phenomenology .",
    "first of all we notice that typical distances between the axes of interacting secondary structure elements in the native state range from 0.46 nm ( two hydrogen - bonded @xmath1-strands@xcite ) to about 1 nm ( two @xmath0-helices or two @xmath1-sheets , @xcite ) . therefore we simply write down an attractive square - well potential in the variable @xmath126 , taking @xmath48 as reprentative of the @xmath23-th helix , with a hard core repulsion preventing overlap between helices .",
    "then , we look at the phenomenology of non - local interactions in the native state , considering at first only the hydrophobic effect and disregarding hydrogen bonds in @xmath1-sheets .",
    "we see that usually two elements of secondary structure tend to pack as closely as possible , just due to the hydrophobic effect . for geometrical reasons",
    "this usually means that they can not be parallel ; thus the number of residues which are actually into contact is independent of the lenght of the helices , and also , roughly , of their characteristics .",
    "if , following li and coworkers  @xcite , we take as the `` microscopic '' contact interaction between two residues that given in eq .",
    "( [ mijemx ] ) , we can write for the interaction between helices : h_ij & = & ( _ 1 - b_ij ) ( b_ij-_0 ) + + & & + _ 4 ( _ 0 - b_ij ) , [ hij ] where @xmath127 are the quantities defined in eq.([qbar ] ) ; @xmath128 is the average number of contacts between residues in two close - packed elements of the secondary structure , @xmath129 provides an hard - core repulsion when the distance is less than @xmath130 ; @xmath131 is the range of the attractive interaction @xmath132 `` normalizes '' the interaction with respect to the other terms in the hamiltonian : again , it should be small compared to @xmath133 .    coming to the hydrogen bonds in a @xmath1-sheet , we see that they tend to align the two interacting strands , independently of their charge . yet , it is known that @xmath1-sheets show very little stability when exposed to the solvent , because residues easily form hydrogen bonds with water . in our approach , where the solvent is taken into account implicitly in the coupling strenght , one should relate hydrogen - mediated interactions to the geometry of the helix and to the surrounding environment ( in order to distinguish between exposed and buried sheets ) .",
    "hence , hydrogen bonds between @xmath1-strands should depend on the overall hydrophobic charge of the environment they are embedded in : this is far too complex to be described exactly .    for the sake of simplicity , we shall use eq.([hij ] ) also to describe interaction between @xmath1-strands , neglecting the tendency towards alignment .",
    "a more detailed representation would involve the introduction of terms involving @xmath134 , and also , perhaps , of @xmath135 , to account for right - handedness of super - secondary structures like @xmath1-x-@xmath1 .",
    "+ as a result of the above discussion , the complete hamiltonian of our model , also including the constraints , reads : h = h_nn + _ i=1^n_h ( h_i^0 + h_i^1 ) + _ i < j=2^n_h h_i , j + v^0 + _ i=1^n_h(v_i^1 + v_i-1,i^2 + v_i-1,i^3 ) , [ protham ] where , recalling here all the results for the sake of clearness : h_nn & = & _ 2 ( n_h-1 ) , + h_i^0 & = & ( n_i-1 ) _ 0 , + h_i^1 & = & - _ 1 n_i p(l_i , w_i ) , + h_ij & = & ( _ 1 - b_ij ) ( b_ij-_0 ) + + & & + _ 4 ( _ 0- b_ij ) , + v^0 & = & _ 0 ( _ i=1^n_h",

    "obviously , it is not the only possible one , and different choices may be useful in different approaches . + an important remark concerns @xmath124 : the choice of an expression independent of @xmath47 introduces possible symmetries in the model that could be exploited to some extent . if , in fact , we disregard the sequence , taking @xmath144 as a constant and neglecting @xmath145 , we see that , given a set of @xmath146 , and a choice of @xmath29 , @xmath51 , @xmath49 , providing a total internal energy @xmath147 , we can certainly change the values of @xmath29 , @xmath51 , @xmath49 , together with the vectors @xmath47 , in such a way that @xmath148 is unchanged and the @xmath48 fixed , so that also the non - local interaction remains the same",
    ". this symmetry is reduced , or removed , by the introduction of the real charges @xmath55 , but this has to be studied independently in each case .",
    "the picture that emerges from the above hamiltonian is that of a complicated interplay among dynamical variables : a helix of a certain shape and lenght , specified by @xmath75,@xmath83,@xmath82 , will be attributed an energy based on @xmath149 ( which is related to dihedral angles conformation ) , plus a sequence - dependent contribution @xmath145 depending on its position @xmath63 along the chain .",
    "the values of @xmath83 and @xmath82 then determine , through constraint @xmath150 , the lenght of the vector @xmath84 , and through @xmath151 , the spatial coordinates @xmath152 of the helix .",
    "the latter , in turn , determine whether the helix considered interacts with other helices by the term @xmath153 , where the charges @xmath154 again depend on the internal coordinate @xmath63 .    for the above reasons , the hamiltonian eq.([protham ] ) is inevitably complicated .",
    "it should be remembered , though , that it describes a _ generic protein _",
    ", with any sequence , and within a very realistic framework , which deals directly with secondary structure elements .",
    "moreover , the model involves a reduction of the intervening number of independent dynamical variables ( @xmath155 against @xmath6 couples @xmath94 , if @xmath6 is the number of residues , with a rough estimate for the ratio as @xmath156 ) , so the shortest proteins could lie within the reach of numerical studies .    in this case predictions of the model",
    "can be compared directly with experimental findings , which could remove the need of an exhaustive search for the ground state , that is the starting point of many lattice models currently studied .",
    "quantities like : @xmath157 measuring the distance of equilibrium structure from the experimental native state ( the average is taken e.g. in a canonical ensemble ) , as well as its analogue referring to line coordinates : @xmath158 can give information on the most appropriate choice of the parameters in the hamiltonian , and on the folding transition .",
    "another important topic to be investigated is that of the identification of order parameters , which could characterize the folding transition _ in an intrinsic way _",
    ", with no reference to a native state known _ a priori_. the study of the temperature dependence of correlation functions could possibly distinguish a true folding transition of a `` good '' sequence from the freezing of a `` bad '' one into any minima of a rugged landscape .    in order to get information about such thermodynamical quantities",
    ", we must be able to evaluate the partition function associated to the protein hamiltonian @xmath159 .",
    "this is of course a very complicated task , and deserves a complete and specific analysis which is beyond the scopes of the present paper . in the next section",
    "we shall show , anyway , that one can resort to the study of simplified models and get indeed useful information both on the protein under investigation , and on the best way to extend the analysis to the more general case of the complete model .",
    "in this section , we shall mainly deal with a simplified version of the model , where only the local terms @xmath160 are kept into account and the number of helices is fixed .",
    "eventually we shall add non - local interactions to it as a small perturbation , in order to retrieve information about the spatial conformation of the protein .    when dealing with the local model , in fact , we loose the description of the spatial structure , but we are left with a highly non - trivial model , with the sequence coming into play through @xmath121 , which provides interesting information about both the native state and the relative importance of the interactions stabilizing it . indeed , the requirement of maximizing the separation of hydrophobic charges on the helices generates a scenario in which the most anphiphilic helices tend to compete with each other in order to grow as long as they can .",
    "the equilibrium configuration one finds in this way specifies how the protein should be partitioned in secondary structure elements to obtain the highest anphiphilicity .",
    "therefore , it provides some important insight on the secondary - structure composition of the native state , so that it is natural to ask oneself if , at least in some cases , the three - dimensional structure could be superimposed to the resulting secondary one , introducing non - local interactions as a small perturbation driving the helices to the correct configuration .    in the first part of the present section",
    "we indeed show that , for the simple synthetic protein ( already studied by kolinski and coworkers @xcite and raleigh and degrado @xcite ) specified by the sequence geveellkkfkelwkg prr geieelfkkfkelikg prr geveellkkfkelwkg prr geieelfkkfkelikg , the above scheme may be successfully applied .",
    "we shall in fact find the set of @xmath29 , @xmath51 corresponding to the minimum of the local hamiltonian ; then , we shall switch on the non - local interaction as a small perturbation and eventually find that native - like configurations are indeed the ground state . encouraged by this result , we shall pursue the study of the local model and , resorting to some general assumptions on @xmath115 and to suitable approximations , we shall find out  in an almost completely analytical way  an expression for the partition function of a generic protein , which can represent a good starting point to study the thermodynamics of the complete model .",
    "both these investigations are intended as preliminary tests , aiming to demonstrate on the one hand that the variables we have chosen accurately describe the sequence , and on the other that the model we propose , despite its complexity , is indeed analytically manageable , at least in some simplified case .",

    "we leave this detailed analysis to future studies , since our goal here was only two show that , despite the complexity of the model , interesting calculations , providing new insight in the folding process , can be performed without resorting to heavy numerical work .",
    "this paper is mainly devoted to the presentation and analysis of a new model hamiltonian to be used in thermodynamical and dynamical studies of the folding process .",
    "the various contributions to the hamiltonian ( [ protham ] ) , and their relation to phenomenology , have been thoroughly discussed , together with the approximations introduced .",
    "even if this part of the model does not contain information on the spatial structure , it takes into account the sequence , so we expect that it can provide relevant information on the secondary structure composition of the native state . to prove that this is indeed the case , we studied the local hamiltonian minima for the protein considered , and then switched on the non - local interactions as a small perturbation , thus superimposing the tertiary structure to the existing secondary one .",
    "we found that the four - helices ground - state is correctly made up of @xmath0-helices , placed in the same positions along the chain as they are found in the experimental native state .",
    "encouraged by this result , we studied the best spatial configuration that the four helices we obtained would assume , due to the non - local mutual interactions .",
    "again we obtained a positive result : bundle - like configurations are indeed the ground - state of the model , even if the latter appears to be degenerate , due to the small number of helices involved and to the highly simplified expression of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath125 .",
    "it is very likely that the degeneracy would be partially or completely removed by the introduction of an interaction potential depending not only on the distance between helices , but also on the mutual orientation of both the hydrophobic moments and of the helices themselves .",
