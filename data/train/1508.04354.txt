    "the nature of the uhecr ( cosmic rays of ultra - high energy , of the order of 10@xmath2 ev or more ) is one of the most challenging and important open questions in astrophysics , as it is crucial for the understanding of their origin and of the mechanism of their production .",
    "the uhecr are observed through the detection of the cascade of particles they induce in the atmosphere : the first interactions occur at energies which can not be reached in colliders , so they are described by models extrapolated above the domain where they can be fitted to the data . as a result",
    "the mass composition of uhecr is still ambiguous and is motivating considerable efforts to improve the observation and the combination of various _ mass indicators _ and to reduce the model dependent uncertainties .",
    "several experimental results have been obtained so far based on the observation of the shower development ( e.g. , depth of the shower maximum , depth of muon production ) , the particle content and the ground ( see for example some recent publications  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we propose a novel method for the determination of the mass composition and the hadronic interaction models by exploring the features of horizontal air showers , impacting the atmosphere with a zenith angle larger than about 60@xmath3 .",
    "+ one key point to identify the primary particle is evaluate the muonic component of the atmospheric shower .",
    "it is negligible within the core , and has to be evaluated in ground detectors at remote distance from the shower axis . at moderate zenith angle ,",
    "the incident flux on the ground is essentially a mixture of photons , electrons , positrons ( the _ electromagnetic _ component ) and muons , and it is difficult to separate unambiguously the muonic components . at large zenith angle ,",
    "the slant depth of the atmosphere is large , so the electromagnetic component is extinguished at ground level .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how the observation of the geomagnetic deviation of muons in nearly horizontal showers may help to reduce these uncertainties and provide useful cross - checks between different measurements of mass indicators . + the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ principle ] , we describe the atmospheric shower and we explain the principle of the method ; the approach used to simulate the muonic flux at ground is explained in sect .",
    "[ simulation ] and we introduce in sect .  [ parametrization ] a convenient parameterization of the generated maps . in sect .",
    "[ correl_prim ] , we show that the coefficients of this parametrization are tightly correlated to the nature of the primary particle and we examine their dependence on the models of hadronic interactions ; in sect .",
    "[ precis_meas ] , we evaluate the precision needed on ground measurements to obtain predictive results and , in sect",
    ".  [ detector ] , we propose possible layouts for a detector .",
    "extensive atmospheric showers produced by protons or nuclei include a _ hadronic _ component ( mainly charged mesons ) and an _ electromagnetic _ component ( photons , electrons and positrons ) induced by the decay of neutral mesons ( mainly pions ) into photons .",
    "these components reach their maximal development after crossing between 500 and 1000 g/@xmath4 , depending on the nature and the energy of the primary particle , and then decrease progressively .",
    "the depth of maximal size @xmath5 ( where the number of charged particles , mainly electrons and positrons , is maximal ) is known and exploited for a long time , and may be considered as a standard ; it is essentially sensitive to the electromagnetic component .    for moderately inclined showers ,",
    "both components reach ground level , and their relative importance ( especially the muonic content ) is in principle an indicator of the nature of the primary , but the techniques needed to evaluate separately the components are not straightforward . at large zenith angles @xmath6 ( typically @xmath7 deg ) the electronic cascade is extinguished and the hadronic one has been transformed through meson decays into a flux of muons which do not interact strongly .",
    "these muons lose their energy mainly through ionization , and many of them decay in flight , but a significant fraction reaches the ground . their initial azimuthal distribution is uniform around the shower axis ; but this symmetry is broken by the deviation in the magnetic field of the earth , which results in a distortion of the density at ground level . a detailed discussion of this effect may be found in @xcite . +    the distribution of the muons in altitude and energy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : prod_altit_ener ] : for showers with a zenith angle around 75 deg , the energy of most muons reaching the ground is of the order of a few gev to a few 10 gev , and their path is a few 10 km , so the magnetic deviation is of the order of a few 100 m : the distortion is sizeable and may be measured by a surface detector with a sufficient granularity .",
    "the deviation is proportional to the square of the path of the muons down to the ground and to the inverse of their energy , which increases in average with the path because of the losses through decay .",
    "the net effect is an increase of the distortion with @xmath6 , and we can expect the distortion to depend also on the longitudinal evolution of the cascade , and especially on @xmath8 , the depth of maximal production of muons , which is tightly correlated to the standard parameter @xmath5 for a given value of the zenith angle @xmath6 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmax_xmumax ] .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 is due to a density effect : for higher @xmath6 , @xmath5 is reached at higher altitude , where the interaction length is larger , so the mesons decay earlier in terms of atmospheric depth .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath8 are indicators of the nature of the primary particle when using a reliable model of the interactions at very high energy , especially the hadronic ones .",
    "our aim is to express this dependence through a simple paramerization of the muon density and provide tools to extract from the observation of inclined showers an estimator of the mass composition using a given model of hadronic interactions at ultra - high energy ; we want also to obtain some discrimination between different models through their prediction of the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "this approach has the advantage of using the pure muonic component of the shower .",
    "moreover in inclined showers the hadronic cascade is observed at a higher energy level than in nearly vertical showers , because the mesons decay earlier .",
    "so the information is complementary to studies at low zenith angles .",
    "taking average values of the parameters , we obtain a simple analytic expression of the density that can be used as an alternative to previous propositions ( @xcite,@xcite ) , which did not account for the variation of the longitudinal profile .",
    "the geometrical frames and coordinates used hereafter are described in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .     with the vertical direction .",
    "a point in the front plane is defined by the polar coordinates @xmath9.,width=453 ]",
    "in this paper we estimate the muon density through a procedure in two stages , to reduce the computing load :    * extract from a shower simulation package the list of the muons at their production point .",
    "we simulate proton and iron showers at different primary energies between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ev , and zenith angles between 64 and 80 deg . * from each sample , propagate the muons to obtain the density on the ground or in a _ front plane _",
    "( orthogonal to the shower axis , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) , with different values of the transverse magnetic field , which is the only relevant quantity because the muons that reach the ground are nearly parallel to the axis .",
    "we do not try to describe the core of the shower ( distance less than about 100 m ) , nor the behaviour at large distances ( @xmath12 1 km ) , where the density is well below one muon per square meter , so that detectors of a reasonable size have little chance to make a precise measurement .",
    "we suppose that the detectors can not distinguish the charge of the muons , so we consider only the total flux as measurable . +    to transpose the geometrical observations into a description in terms of the depth @xmath13 , the vertical profile of the atmosphere as a function of the altitude @xmath14 needs to be known at any time , not only to define the stage of evolution of the hadronic cascade , but also to describe properly the rate of decay of mesons , which depends on the density @xmath15 .",
    "fortunately , this profile has little diurnal and seasonal variations at altitudes between 10 and 30 km above sea level @xcite , where most of the muons are produced in the showers we are interested to .",
    "so in the simulation of the showers we use the standard linsley atmosphere @xcite . for the propagation of the muons we use either the same model , or a pure exponential profile to obtain analytical evaluations .",
    "+    through their decays and their radiative interactions initiating electromagnetic cascades of low energy , the muons generates continuously the so - called `` electromagnetic halo '' ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these cascades develop over a short distance compared to the muon path to the ground , so the electromagnetic flux follows closely the shape of the muonic one , and undergoes the same magnetic distortion . the impact on surface measurements ( essentially a constant factor in most cases ) depend on the nature of the detectors , and",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "so we do not simulate the electromagnetic halo .",
    "the energy loss @xmath16 is supposed to be constant ( 2 mev.g@xmath17@xmath4 ) .",
    "this is a good approximation in the medium range of energy ( few 100 mev to 10 gev ) .",
    "very energetic muons lose more per unit of depth , but the total loss is anyway a small fraction of their initial energy ; moreover they are concentrated in the core , and are weakly deviated .",
    "muons of low energy stop rapidly and contribute little to the density at ground .",
    "+      to simulate the atmospheric shower we use the package corsika @xcite .",
    "we set options for the _ thinning _ procedure such that the statistical weight of the hadrons remains low ( less than 10 within the pure hadronic cascade and less than 1000 for hadronic subproducts of the electromagnetic cascade through a photo - nuclear interaction ) .",
    "corsika offers an option to output the list of the muons generated by the hadronic cascade , with their production point , their momentum at this point and their statistical weight @xmath18 inherited from the parent particle .",
    "the production region of the muons reaching the ground is mainly concentrated within a few ten meters around the shower ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prod_dist_ener ] ) , and this distance is small compared to both the magnetic deviation and the dispersion due to the multiple coulomb scattering .",
    "so we keep only the longitudinal position of the origin of the muon .",
    "the original direction of the muon is slightly affected by the magnetic deviation of its parent ( most of the time a pion or a kaon ) , which has the same charge and a similar energy . for a given momentum @xmath19 the mean flight is @xmath20 ;",
    "the ratio @xmath21 is much smaller for a kaon than for a pion , so we will discuss only the pion case .",
    "the angular deviation over a length @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the transverse field ( in tesla ) and @xmath19 the momentum in ev@xmath25 , that is @xmath26 ; with @xmath27 for the field at the surface of the earth , we see that @xmath28 mrad anywhere .",
    "this value is small compared to the deviation of the produced muon along its path to the ground , and we have checked that changing systematically the initial directions of the muons by @xmath291 mrad ( depending on the charge ) does not modify significantly our results .",
    "so we assume a perfect symmetry of the directions around the axis and to obtain smooth density maps we replace every muon by @xmath30 clones obtained by successive rotations of @xmath31 around the shower axis , each one with a weight @xmath32 .",
    "+    this sample is the input for two different procedures aimed to obtain the map of the muon flux on the ground :    * a stepwise extrapolation of the muons through the atmosphere down to the ground , accounting for energy loss , multiple scattering , decay probability and magnetic deviation in each step . for a muon of weight @xmath18",
    ", @xmath30 is chosen as the integer just above @xmath33 , so the clones have a weight less than 0.2 . *",
    "an analytic computation of a density of probability in the front plane for each input muon , in the approximation of an exponential atmosphere profile , and a weighted summation of these densities . in this option @xmath34 .",
    "these procedures are detailed in the following subsections .",
    "each clone is propagated by steps ( initially 1 km ) until the muon stops , decays or reaches the ground .",
    "the energy loss is computed according to the local density of air , which is defined as a function of the altitude .",
    "the step length is divided by 2 if the muon loses more than the half of its energy . in",
    "each step the position and the direction undergo a deterministic deviation from the magnetic field , and a random one to account for the multiple scattering @xcite .",
    "when a step goes below the ground level , a linear interpolation gives the impact at the ground .",
    "it was checked that reducing the step length did not modify significantly the final distribution .    from the set of surviving muons",
    ", we want to define a ground density .",
    "a first option is just to count the number of muons per unit of ground surface . doing so we observe a forward - backward asymmetry due to the divergence of the muons : the muons hitting the ground in the upstream region have a large angle of incidence .",
    "we can also define an _",
    "intrinsic _ density as the number of muons hitting a unit surface in a plane orthogonal to the shower axis .",
    "in that case there is still an asymmetry because the upstream and downstream impacts are not at the same longitudinal position in the shower . in practice",
    "what matters is the number of muons entering a detector ; if the detector is a planar vertical surface , the intrinsic density is more relevant to estimate the response",
    ". we will show in sect .",
    "[ compar_step_anal ] that the forward - backward asymmetry does not prevent us from exploiting the magnetic distortion in a reliable way .      in the local ground frame ( @xmath35 axis",
    "upwards on the vertical direction , with the ground at @xmath36 ) , the atmospheric depth ( quantity of matter above altitude @xmath35 ) is described by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the attenuation length ( typically 8 km ) .",
    "we define the _ shower frame _ with a coordinate @xmath39 along the shower axis ( origin at ground level ) , @xmath40 perpendicular to the shower axis in the horizontal plane ( see fig . [",
    "fig : geometry ] ) . an inclined shower with a zenith angle @xmath6",
    "is considered as equivalent to a vertical one in an exponential atmosphere with a scaled attenuation length : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the slant depth at ground level and @xmath43 the attenuation length along the axis .",
    "actually there is a transverse gradient of density in the shower frame , so this expression is valid only around the axis , at a short distance compared to @xmath38 : we show in sect .",
    "[ compar_step_anal ] that this asymmetry , combined with the fact that the ground is replaced by a plane orthogonal to the shower axis , has little consequence on the evaluation of the distortion .",
    "+    let us consider a muon ( mass @xmath44 , lifetime @xmath45 ) injected at @xmath46 , that is at a slant depth @xmath47 ) , with a kinetic energy @xmath48 , nearly parallel to the shower axis .",
    "we define @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( energy extrapolated backwards to infinite altitude ) .",
    "in appendix we obtain the following results :    * the muon can reach the ground if @xmath51 , with a probability @xmath52 ( this expression was already derived in @xcite within the same approximations ) * the magnetic angular deviation ( perpendicular to the transverse field @xmath53 ) is : + @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 or @xmath56 if the energies are expressed in ev ) + and the transverse displacement from a straight line : @xmath57 * the variance of the angular deviation due to the multiple scattering is : @xmath58 and the variance of the displacement : @xmath59 with @xmath60    with these expressions we can attribute a weighted density in the ( @xmath61 ) plane to each muon emitted with a weight @xmath18 at @xmath46 along the unit vector ( @xmath62 ) ; for example , if @xmath63 is along @xmath40 axis , so the deviation along @xmath64 :    @xmath65    where @xmath29 represents the sign of the muon charge .",
    "as expected , the magnetic distortion increases with the zenith angle @xmath6 , and with the magnitude of the transverse field @xmath24 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_xy ] which shows the contour levels of the densities of muons ( total or charge separated ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 is not trivial ; we can distinguish two extreme cases :    * weak distortion ( low @xmath6 and @xmath24 ) : the total density is the sum of the positive and the negative components : at a given position , each one differs from the undistorted one by a small amount , which is proportional to @xmath24 , with opposite signs , so the global effect cancels at first order , and the variation is of the second order in @xmath24 . * strong distortion ( large @xmath6 and @xmath24 ) : almost everywhere , the flux is fully dominated by muons of one sign , so the dependence on @xmath24 is stronger .      for each value of @xmath6 and @xmath24",
    "we want to find an analytical expression of the density in the front plane at ground level , as a function of the distance @xmath66 to axis and the azimuthal angle @xmath67 , with @xmath68 in the direction perpendicular to @xmath53 .",

    "the analytic density has no forward - backward asymmetry in the shower frame , while the stepwise evaluation includes two sources of asymmetry : the non uniform density of air and the fact that the ground is not perpendicular to the shower axis .",
    "moreover the distortion depends not only on @xmath81 , but also on its direction @xmath82 in the front plane . to account for the asymmetry in the stepwise density ,",

    "we can extract a parabolic parametrization of @xmath85 and @xmath86 as functions of @xmath73 , that is coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are quite similar to the ones obtained with the analytic method .",
    "here we choose qgsjet ii.04 @xcite as a reference model for the hadronic interactions . with @xmath90 deg , @xmath91 30 @xmath92 t and @xmath93 0.1 , 1 and 10 eev ( 10 proton and 10 iron showers at each energy ) , fig .",

    "it is important to note that proton and iron showers at different energies are on the same line , that is , the shape parameters provide an indirect measurement of @xmath94 that can be used for the identification of the primary .",
    "the same behaviour is observed for the other values of the zenith angle and the transverse field .",
    "of course the effective identification power ( for individual events , or statistically for a sample of events ) depends on the precision that may be achieved on the measurement of the zenith angle and the shape parameters .",

    "[ precis_meas ] .    in principle",
    "the density computed with the stepwise extrapolation is more realistic than the analytic one .",
    "[ fig : compar_step_anal ] shows that the shape parameters of the density at ground level have the same dependence on @xmath94 as found with the analytic method .",
    "the difference is essentially a global shift , depending on the direction of the field in the front plane .",
    "so we did not apply the stepwise method to the whole set of showers , and we draw conclusions from the results of the analytic method .",
    "we have chosen 3 available alternative options : epos - lhc @xcite , qgsjet1 @xcite and sibyll @xcite , the last two being generally considered as obsolete . for each one ,",

    "we have also tried to modify by hand some characteristics of the muons .",
    "first , by multiplying all transverse momenta by 1.1 , because the distribution in @xmath95 may affect the interpretation of the muonic flux at a fixed distance from core .",
    "we have also simulated a global contraction of the longitudinal profile of muon production , without modifying @xmath94 , by replacing for each muon the depth of production @xmath96 by @xmath97 , and dividing its energy by the ratio of the air density at the new position to the original one .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dep_pt_prof ] : the contraction of the profile has no significant effect , while the scaling of @xmath95 results in an important shift of the parameters .",
    "this means that the magnetic distortion is very sensitive to the distribution of the transverse momentum , which is governed by the latest hadronic interactions .",
    "we want here to obtain an evaluation of the measurement errors using an ideal detector which is a regular array of identical elements acting as pure muon counters , that is , giving the number of muons crossing their area @xmath98 ( projected onto the front plane of the shower axis ) with a poissonian distribution .",
    "actually the detector may see the electrons of the electromagnetic halo , and also some photons if they interact with the material : from this point of view , this approximation is conservative .    for the following evaluations we define a _ standard detector array _ : a square array of spacing @xmath99 m on a horizontal ground , with @xmath100 m@xmath101 .",

    "the precision on @xmath6 may be evaluated for the _ standard array _ through a conservative approach :    * making a precise evaluation of @xmath94 for a single event requires to have measurements on a wide area , at least up to 1000 m from shower axis .",
    "* we assume that the precision on the front time measured in a detector is the dispersion of the arrival times of the muons , instead of accounting for the time of the first one , which has less fluctuation in case of multiples hits . *",
    "we ignore the information from detectors at more than 1000 m from the core and we attribute to the measurements the dispersion @xmath104 found at 1000 m by the stepwise propagation of muons .",
    "this is an overestimation because the dispersion increases with the distance .",
    "we find around 100 ns for @xmath105 deg , 50 ns for @xmath90 deg and 30 ns for @xmath106 deg .",
    "we can suppose that the timing precision of the detector is better than 10 ns .    with these values , we can evaluate the precision on @xmath6 using the projection onto the front plane .",

    "the errors on @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath76 depend little on @xmath24 and moderately on @xmath6 , while the error on @xmath94 from the compound model decreases strongly , as expected , with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 is more complicated : for @xmath150 t , the precision on @xmath94 is dominated by the dependence of @xmath77 , so the error decreases with increasing @xmath6 ; at low @xmath6 and @xmath24 , the dependence of @xmath76 is the most important one and may favour a low value of @xmath6 .",
    "if the errors are computed for a fixed energy , the dependence on @xmath6 is compensated by the decrease of @xmath133 with @xmath6 ; using the scaling properties , the result may be summarized in the following way : for the highest values of @xmath24 , the error on @xmath94 ( in g/@xmath4 ) is of the order of @xmath151 g/@xmath4 , with @xmath143 in km , @xmath152 in eev , @xmath98 in m@xmath101 . as a result ,",
    "when using a given hadronic model , an event by event identification may be envisaged if the error on @xmath153 is about 50 g/@xmath4 or less , that is , for the standard array , at energies of the order of 5 eev or more , if the local geomagnetic field is at least 40 @xmath92 t .    if the muon detector array is completed by an independent measurement of @xmath94 ( or @xmath5 , which is tightly correlated ) , comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : compar_param_vs_xmax ] and fig[fig : err_xmx ] indicates in which conditions the shape parameters can provide some discrimination between hadronic models .",
    "the results found here may be used at different levels of demanding observations , that is also at different levels of dependence on models .    * assuming a reliable model of hadronic interaction : an array of muon detectors can obtain an average value of @xmath94 at lower energies and possibly an event - by - event determination at high energy . as an internal check ,",
    "the model has to reproduce the observed dependence on @xmath6 . * using an external calibration , that is taking the average @xmath5 from another experiment in similar conditions of zenith angle , and correcting for a different atmosphere profile if needed .",
    "the hadronic model has to give the right average value of @xmath94 : if the model is acceptable , the spectrum of @xmath94 may be exploited , especially on an event - by - event basis at highest energies .",
    "this option may be uneasy , because it requires a combination of different experiments . * building a hybrid detector including a muon array and a longitudinal profile detector covering a few ten kilometers in at least one direction from the muon array , a self - calibrated measurement could be achieved .",
    "the profile detector could be made of single fluorescence eyes with a wide field of view as proposed in @xcite : for nearly horizontal showers passing above such eyes , the time profile of the received light gives a good measurement of the portion of profile within the field of view .",
    "a possible layout of a hybrid detector is proposed in fig .",
    "[ fig : array ] . any other detector able to see",
    "the profile from the side could replace the fluorescence detection with the advantage of a larger duty cycle .",
    "the intensity and the inclination of the magnetic field depends on the location on the surface on the earth .",
    "it has a maximum of about 65 @xmath92 t in the north of asia or in the antarctic region south of australia , where its direction is nearly vertical , providing a large value of @xmath24 for nearly horizontal incidence , whatever the azimuth angle .",
    "another important parameter is the altitude .",
    "higher altitude is preferable for higher zenith angle , because the attenuation of the muon component may prevent an efficient detection after a long path ; in the case of a hybrid detector , another advantage is also to reduce the distance between the ground and the maximum of the longitudinal profile .    in this study , we have assumed an horizontal ground , but this is not an experimental requirement .",
    "the slope of the ground may increase the aperture for a restricted azimuthal region , and an elongated shape of the array , with a larger spacing of the detectors in that direction , may be the best option .    in any configuration",
    ", the profile of the atmosphere needs to be known precisely , because it may be the main source of systematic errors . in case of large diurnal and/or seasonal variations , it should be carefully monitored .",
    "using a semi - analytic calculation of the density of muons in inclined atmospheric showers , in the approximation of small angular deviations , we have shown that the geomagnetic deflection provides an indirect measurement of @xmath94 , the depth of maximal production of muons , which is an indicator of the nature of the primary particle , tightly correlated to the usual parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this measurement may be performed using an universal parametrization of the muon density as a function of the distance to the shower axis and the azimuthal angle in projection onto the front plane ( perpendicular to the shower axis at ground level ) .",
    "a significant dependence on @xmath94 was found for three parameters @xmath76 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , especially the second one which describes the amplitude of the quadrupolar distortion of the muon density in the front plane due to the transverse component @xmath154 of the magnetic field .",
    "the calculation of the density was successfully compared to detailed simulations of the muon propagation in some showers .",
    "the parametrization may be inaccurate for very strong distortions , that is for highest values of @xmath6 and/or @xmath24 : in such cases the sensitivity to @xmath5 is certainly strong and a more accurate simulation of trajectories and a more complex parametrization may be needed to fully exploit the observations .",
    "however at large @xmath6 the muonic flux is attenuated and more difficult to measure at ground level ; the potential gain on primary identification using events with @xmath155 needs a specific study ( maybe with a more elaborated parametrization ) , beyond the scope of this paper . + a precise measurement on the direction",
    "is needed as the dependence of the parameters on @xmath6 is important , and increases with @xmath6 ; fortunately the front of inclined showers is thin , and the thickness decreases with @xmath6 , so a precise measurement of the arrival time of the muons ( at the level of 10 ns or better ) can determine @xmath6 with enough precision to extract the dependence of the parameters on @xmath94 .    in practice",
    "the density is measured on the ground instead of the front plane , so the longitudinal evolution of the shower and the divergence of muons from the axis result in a forward / backward asymmetry of the observed density : this effect is essentially a dipolar distortion which may be evaluated and corrected for ; in any case it may be disentangled from the magnetic distortion . the linear relation between the distortion parameters and @xmath94",
    "is slightly shifted by a quantity depending on the orientation of the transverse field within the front plane , but the slope is not modified . a correction for asymmetries of the front at ground level may be needed to suppress a possible bias on @xmath6 ; detailed simulations can estimate such a bias .",
    "the variations of the atmospheric density profile at low altitude ( below the region of production of the muons ) impact mainly the energy loss , so the usual variations of a few percent do not modify too much the density at ground , and they are easy to monitor .",
    "variations in upper atmosphere are in principle not large , but they may affect the development of the hadronic cascade and modify the altitude of production of the muons and their energy spectrum : this may change both the position of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath5 , and the relation between the distortion parameters and @xmath94 , which depends on the distance from production to ground .",
    "so for a given site , the profile of the upper atmosphere and its possible variations should be known .",
    "+ we have proposed some possible scenarios of application of the mass sensitive parameters measured with the method developped in this paper .",
    "especially , a hybrid detector able to measure simultaneously the longitudinal profile and the magnetic distortion of muons in horizontal showers , can provide strong constraints on the models of hadronic interactions .",
    "this option could be valuable to step forward in both the hadronic modelling and in the determination of the composition of uhecrs .",
