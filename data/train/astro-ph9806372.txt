    "b2  1028 + 313 is a well - known , nearby ( @xmath1 ) radio - loud quasar , at radio wavelengths the quasar has a bright , inverted - spectrum core and a one - sided radio jet to the nnw ( gower & hutchings 1984 ) . on larger scales",
    ", the radio emission extends to the nnw and sse ( owen , white , & ge 1993 ; owen & ledlow 1997 ) . the radio axis varies with radius around a mean position angle of @xmath2 ( measured from the north to the east ) .",
    "the quasar is a bright x - ray source ( zamorani et al .",
    "1981 ; blumenthal , keel , & miller 1982 ; wilkes & elvis 1987 ) , whose spectrum shows evidence for a soft x - ray excess above a power - law spectrum ( elvis , wilkes , & tannabaum 1985 ; wilkes & elvis 1987 ; masnou et al .  1992 ; zhou & yu 1992 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of the quasar is rich in emission lines , and shows a strong rise to the blue ( jackson & browne 1991 ; shastri et al .  1993 ; owen , ledlow , & keel 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the quasar is also quite bright in the uv ( lanzetta , turnshek , & sandoval 1993 ) .",
    "recently , owen , ledlow , & keel ( 1995 ) noticed that the quasar is located in the central cd galaxy of a1030 , an abell richness class 0 cluster ( abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) . at low redshift ,",
    "it is uncommon for quasars to be located in the center of a cluster , although higher redshift radio quasars are more strongly clustered ( e.g. , yee & ellingson 1993 ) .",
    "the host galaxy of b2  1028 + 313 is a large , very bright elliptical galaxy which is similar to other cd galaxies in its optical properties ( ledlow & owen 1995 ) .",
    "the major axis of the galaxy is at a position angle of 45@xmath3 , which is about 75@xmath3 away from the radio axis .",
    "the location of this nearby radio quasar in the center of a rich cluster suggests that some portion of the x - ray emission from the system may be coming from intracluster gas .",
    "the x - ray luminosity determined from the @xmath4 observatory data was @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ( 0.33.5 kev : wilkes & elvis 1987 ) , which is typical for rich abell clusters .",
    "on the other hand , a1030 is a apparently a poor cluster .",
    "the x - ray flux is about 30 times higher than would be expected based on the correlation between core x - ray and radio fluxes of core - dominated radio quasars ( worrall et al .",
    "the core in b2  1028 + 313 provides more than 50% of the 5 ghz radio flux ( gower & hutchings 1984 ; condon et al .",
    "1994 ) , so that b2  1028 + 313 is core - dominated .",
    "on the other hand , its ratio of x - ray to optical flux is more consistent with values for lobe - dominated radio quasars ( worrall et al .",
    "1994 ) , where the x - ray emission may have a large contribution from thermal emission by ambient gas .    the presence of this bright , nearby quasar in the center of a cluster provides an important opportunity to study the interaction between the agn and its environment .",
    "if a portion of the x - ray emission is due to the presence of a hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , then it is likely that the radio source may interact with this thermal plasma . the radio source associated with the quasar is quite compact ( owen & ledlow 1997 ) , as might be expected if it were confined by dense icm .",
    "moreover , the quasar is surrounded by a luminous emission - line region extended on scales @xmath025 kpc ( owen et al .",
    "1998 ) , typical of those found in cooling - flow clusters ( e.g. , heckman et al .  1989 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the icm in the region around the quasar is particularly dense , because of a cooling flow .",
    "the location of this quasar in the center of a cluster also provides a light source for searching for absorption by cooler material in the icm . in this regard",
    ", the fact that b2  1028 + 313 is particularly bright in the uv is very useful .",
    "recently , we used _",
    "uv spectra to set very strong limits on the absorbing column of any cooler material in the cluster ( koekemoer et al .",
    "one might also be able to detect cool or hot components of the icm as absorption lines or edges in the x - ray spectrum of the quasar ( sarazin 1989 ; wise & sarazin 1997 ) .    in this paper , we present _ rosat _ pspc and hri images and _ asca _ and _ rosat _ pspc spectra of the x - ray emission from b2  1028 + 313 and the surrounding a1030 cluster .",
    "the first object of these observations are to determine the x - ray properties of the quasar .",
    "secondly , we want to detect or limit the x - ray emission from intracluster gas in a1030 , and to search for evidence for a central cooling flow in this cluster .",
    "third , we want to study the interaction of the radio source with its environment , and search for x - ray emission associated with the extended radio lobes .",
    "finally , if there is evidence for dense icm around the quasar , we will search for x - ray absorption features in the quasar spectrum due to the ambient gas .",
    "the x - ray observations are presented in   [ sec : data ] .",
    "the observed x - ray fluxes are compared and variability detected in   [ sec : flux ] . in   [",

    "the x - ray spectra from _ rosat _ and _ asca _ are presented in   [ sec : spectra ] , and are compared to combinations of nonthermal models for emission by the agn and thermal models for icm emission .",
    "we also place limits on any emission or absorption lines in   [",
    "sec : spectra_lines ] .",
    "the results are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] , where we review the x - ray properties of the quasar , and consider the limits on the thermal emission by the icm .",

    "all distance - dependent values in this paper assume @xmath7 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath8 . unless otherwise stated , all of the uncertainties are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "a1030 was observed with the _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) during the period 11 - 27 may , 1996 .",
    "the total exposure time was 18,600 seconds .",
    "in addition to the normal processing of the data , we examined the light curve of a large source - free region to check for any periods of enhanced background , and none were found . because we are interested in achieving the best possible angular resolution",
    ", we also examined the aspect history for any anomalies during the accepted time in the image .",
    "none were found .",
    "the x - ray image was corrected for particle background , exposure , and vignetting using the sxrb software package of snowden ( 1995 ) .",
    "in addition to a1030/b2  1028 + 313 , 14 other rather weak x - ray sources appear in the hri image .",
    "only one of these could be identified , and it corresponded to an otherwise unidentified x - ray source from the @xmath4 catalog , 2e  1027.6 + 3112 .",
    "a1030 was also observed with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) .",
    "we have extracted these observations from the public archive to help constrain the spatial extent and spectral properties of the emission from this system .",
    "a1030 was observed for 2,481 seconds on 5 , february 1992 ( rp700433 ; p.i .",
    "b. wilkes ) .",
    "( actually , the observation was much longer than this , but most of the data were unusable , apparently because of problems with the aspect solution . ) a longer observation of 6,906 seconds was made on the same day with the boron filter in place .",
    "the extra opacity of this filter means that the unfiltered and filtered observations produced a similar number of photons from a1030 .",
    "the pspc data were screened for periods of high background based on a master veto rate @xmath9 170 ( plucinsky et al .",
    "1993 ) , for other times of high background , for periods of 15 seconds after switching to the high voltage , and for periods with an uncertain aspect solution .",
    "the resulting live exposure times for the two images were 2,155 seconds for the unfiltered image and 6698 seconds for the image with the boron filter .",
    "the average values of the master veto rate were 79.6 for the unfiltered data and 78.6 for the boron filter data .",
    "a1030 was observed with _",
    "asca _ in two intervals on 1995 may 3 - 4 and may 7 .",
    "the two pointings were nearly identical , and have been combined in all of the analysis .",
    "although the data were originally processed with revision 1 of the standard processing , they were screened using the standard revision 2 screening criteria .",
    "in addition , light curves of the data were constructed and searched for otherwise unrejected data in periods with high background or data dropouts .",
    "the total exposures were approximately 36.8 ksec for the sis and 39.0 ksec for the gis .",
    "the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) detectors operated with only one chip per detector being active ( s0c1 and s1c3 ) . in order to maximize the spectral resolution and the accuracy of the calibration , all of the sis data were taken in faint mode and analyzed in bright2 mode .",
    "the sis data were corrected for the echo effect and dark frame error using ftools faint version 3.11 .",
    "the sis pi channels were determined using sispi version 1.1 using the gain file of 110397 .",
    "hot and flickering pixels were removed with cleansis version 1.6 .",
    "a level discriminator ( at approximately 0.42 kev ) was used to avoid telemetry saturation when sis data were taken at medium data rate .    during the period of this observation ,",
    "the gis-3 spectral gain was sometimes overestimated by the standard asca processing ( idesawa et al .",
    "this was corrected using the ftools temp2gain version 4.1 with the 1996 may 12 version of the gis_temp2gain calibration file .",
    "in the _ rosat _ hri observations , a total of @xmath10 counts were detected from a1030 , after corrections for background , exposure , and vignetting .",
    "this corresponds to a flux of @xmath11 ergs s@xmath6 in the observed 0.2  2.0 kev frame , uncorrected for absorption .",

    "only statistical uncertainties are included ; the calibration errors are probably at least as large as the statistical uncertainties in most cases .",

    "the _ rosat _ pspc and hri fluxes assume the best - fit single power - law fit to the _ rosat _ pspc x - ray spectrum (   [ sec : spectra_pspc ] ) .",
    "also , the flux listed was derived from the unfiltered pspc observation .",
    "the observation with the boron filter , which occurred on the same date as the unfiltered observation , gave a flux which was 7% higher (   [ sec : spectra_pspc ] ) .",
    "this is within the uncertainties in the fluxes ; it is also likely that the calibration errors in the two instruments are of this order .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "flux is based on the sis0 , gis2 , and gis3 instruments .",
    "the flux in sis1 was slightly lower (   [ sec : spectra_asca ] ) , but consistent within the likely calibration uncertainties .",
    "the fluxes from the _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ pspc are remarkably consistent , given the passage of 13 years .",
    "the flux from the _ rosat _ hri is only slightly higher , and marginally consistent within the uncertainties . on the other hand , the observed flux during the _ asca _ observation was about a factor of two lower than any of the other fluxes .",
    "this result does not depend on the particular spectral model used to convert count rates into fluxes for each of the instruments .",
    "thus , we conclude that although the x - ray flux may have remained approximately constant for much of the time since 1979 , it must on occasion vary by at least a factor of two on time scale as short as a year . on the other hand , there was no significant evidence for any variation during the period of _ rosat _ hri observation , during the _ rosat _ pspc observation , or during the _ asca _ observation .",
    "this may indicate that the source does nt vary by a large factor on time scales as short as a few days to two weeks .",
    "the variability of the source on time scales of a year means that at least 50% of the x - ray emission is from the quasar rather than the cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig : hri_contour]a shows the contour map of the inner approximately @xmath26 of the hri image of a1030 .",

    "1993 ) , smoothed in the same way as the data .",
    "the image of a1030 appears somewhat more extended than that expected from a point source , and is elongated at a position angle ( @xmath32 ) of about -29@xmath3 ( measured counterclockwise from north ) .",
    "none of the other sources in the hri image are bright enough to usefully test for a similar extension in the image .",
    "the hri observation of a1030 was done in 6 obis ( observational intervals ) during the period 11 - 27 may , 1996 . the image in figure  [ fig :",
    "hri_contour]a resulted from combining all of these observations . to check for possible offsets in the aspect solution between these obis",

    "they all gave a consistent centroid for the x - ray emission , and all showed an elongation in the same general direction ( @xmath33 ) .    during most pointed observations with _",
    ", the satellite is `` wobbled '' by several arcmin with a period of several hundred seconds .",
    "morse ( 1994 ) has suggested that errors in the aspect solution during wobbling can result in extended and elongated images of point sources .",
    "although he argues that the aspect errors are associated with the wobble , morse finds that the observed elongations of the images of point sources are nt necessarily parallel to the projection of the wobble on the sky .",
    "the nominal roll angle for the observation of a1030 was @xmath34 ( measured clockwise from north ) .",
    "this implies that the projection of the wobble on the sky was at @xmath35 .",
    "unfortunately , this is very close to the observed direction of elongation of the central part of the image of a1030 in figure  [ fig : hri_contour]a .",
    "this increases the concern that extent and elongation of our hri image of a1030 might be due to the effects of the wobble , rather than due to extended emission from the cluster .",
    "morse ( 1994 ) developed a technique to attempt to correct for aspect errors due to the wobble .",
    "unfortunately , his original technique can only be applied to very bright sources . in appendix",
    "[ sec : aspect ] , we present a variant on morse s algorithm which can be applied to fainter sources .",
    "the resulting image of the center of a1030 is shown in figure  [ fig : hri_contour]b .",
    "the center part of this image is considerably narrower than the original image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hri_contour]a ) .",
    "however , beyond a few arcsec , the `` wobble - corrected '' image is very similar to the original image , and is elongated in nearly the same direction ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the wobble - corrected image still appears somewhat more elongated than the hri prf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hri_contour]c ) .",
    "we conclude that the wobble - corrected image in figure  [ fig : hri_contour]b actually is a better representation of the correct image of the central region of a1030 .",
    "however , the restriction to a finite set of regions on the detector implies that this image is missing flux at larger distances from the center of the a1030 , and we use the original image beyond the central 10 , and for determining the total flux from the source .",
    "3.6truein    0.2truein    to determine or limit the flux from a1030 which is due to extended cluster emission , we accumulated the hri counts in annuli centered on the x - ray centroid . all of the annuli had at least 20 counts to assure the applicability of gaussian statistics .",
    "other x - ray sources were excluded .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profile for the wobble - corrected image is shown in figure  [ fig : hri_surf ] .",
    "the data points give the observed surface brightness , corrected for background , exposure , and vignetting . for comparison",
    ", we constructed an image of the _ rosat _ prf , and normalized it to have the same number of counts within a radius of 100  as the actual image .",
    "note that the broad wings on the image ( @xmath37 ) are apparently just due to the prf ; this is the `` halo '' produced by the electrostatic screen on the hri .",
    "this halo severely limits our ability to detect extended faint emission with the hri .",

    "when this galactic extinction correction is made , a broad 2200   absorption feature in the uv spectrum largely disappears .",
    "there is a residual feature at slightly longer wavelengths , which might be due to intrinsic absorption at the quasar redshift , additional galactic absorption , or a very broad emission line at longer wavelengths which was not subtracted from the spectrum .",

    "the far - ir values , which are shown as inverted triangles in figure  [ fig : sed ] , are upper limits .",

    "this peak is crudely similar to a @xmath020 ev blackbody , although the observed peak is considerably broader than a single temperature blackbody .",

    "this may indicate that the non - thermal spectrum flattens with increasing frequency .",

    "however , the uncertainties in the near - ir make it difficult to be certain about the spectrum there .",
    "the hard x - ray power - law spectrum would extrapolate to flux consistent with the highest frequency radio measurement , but it is not clear whether the radio spectrum has turned over by this point .",
    "one of the aims of this work was to determine the properties of the intracluster medium in a1030 by separating the x - ray emission of that medium from that of the quasar b2  1028 + 313 .",
    "we had hoped to detect intracluster emission spatially ( as an extended component ) and spectrally ( as a thermal component in the x - ray spectrum ) .",
    "we did detect an extended component to the x - ray emission , which was elongated to the nnw and ssw ( figures  [ fig : hri_contour ] and [ fig : pspc_contour ] ) .",
    "however , there are several features of this emission which are inconsistent with normal icm emission from clusters .",
    "first , it is rather highly elongated ( figure  [ fig : pspc_contour ] ) .",
    "second , its radial surface brightness profile is not well - fit by either a beta - model or a cooling flow model .",

    "if we exclude the elongated x - ray features in figure  [ fig : pspc_contour ] , less than 4% of the x - ray emission in the _ rosat _ band originates in an extended component beyond a radius of 1 .",
    "of course , the brightest cluster x - ray emission may be blended into quasar emission at the center of the cluster . if a1030 had icm with a distribution which followed a beta model ( eq .",
    "[ eq : beta_model ] ) with @xmath132 and @xmath133 kpc , then @xmath954% of the icm x - ray emission should lie at projected radii greater than 1 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1348% of the total x - ray emission is due to the icm , and that an upper limit on the icm x - ray luminosity is @xmath135 erg s@xmath6 ( 0.210 kev ) .",

    "the upper limit is at the high end of the x - ray luminosities observed for richness 0 clusters at redshifts below 0.25 ( e.g. , rosati et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the elongation of the extended x - ray emission in a1030 is along the same direction as the extended radio emission . on small scales ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the radio image of b2  1028 + 313 shows a bright core and a jet propagating to the north at a position angle of about @xmath2 ( gower & hutchings 1984 ) . on larger scales , radio lobes",
    "are seen to the nnw and sse . while the orientation varies somewhat with radius between positions angles of about @xmath142 and 0@xmath3 to the north , and about 130@xmath3 and 170@xmath3 to the south , overall the orientation is along position angles of about @xmath2 and @xmath143 ( owen , white , & ge 1993 ; owen & ledlow 1997 ) .",
    "the largest scale radio emission is most useful for comparison to the x - ray emission . on scales comparable to the size of the extended x - ray emission in the _ rosat _ pspc image ( figure  [ fig : pspc_contour ] )",
    ", the best radio image may be provided by the nvss survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "4.2truein    figure  [ fig : nvss_pspc ] shows contours of the _ rosat _ image superposed on a greyscale representation of the nvss 20  cm radio images .",
    "the nvss image has a resolution of 45 .",
    "the radio source to the east is almost certainly an unrelated background source .",
    "at radii of 12 , the radio emission is elongated in nearly the same direction as the x - ray emission .",
    "it is not clear whether the radio emission continues to larger radii ; if one extrapolates the observed radial surface brightness trend to larger radii , the emission might be expected to be below the noise in the nvss image .",
    "the total flux density of the radio source is 254 mjy at 20 cm ( owen & ledlow 1997 ) . in the nvss image , 215 mjy of emission is due to unresolved emission from the central source , leaving a total of 39 mjy of possible extended emission on the scale of the 45  beam of the survey .",
    "the fluxes in the northern and southern extensions on the nvss image in figure  [ fig : nvss_pspc ] are about 5.4 and 7.4 mjy , respectively .",
    "extended emission is also seen at lower frequencies in the 49 cm wenss survey image of this region ( rengelink et al .",
    "although the noise level is higher and the beam larger than in the nvss survey , the wenss image shows north and south lobes at the same locations as in the nvss image .",
    "the flux densities of the northern and southern lobes at 49 cm are 22.5 and 20.3 mjy , respectively . because of differences in the resolution",
    ", it is unclear whether the nvss and wenss fluxes correspond to identical regions . to reduce somewhat the uncertainties",
    ", we will sum the emission from the two lobes in each of the instruments .",
    "assuming they come from the same region , the ratio of fluxes implies an energy spectral index in the radio of @xmath144 ( a photon number spectral index of @xmath145 ) , where the error estimate follows from the different values for the northern and southern lobes .",
    "this is similar to , but not quite as steep as , the spectral index suggested by the x - ray colors of the extended emission (   [ sec : spatial_pspc ] ) .",
    "given the fluxes , size , and spectral index , we can estimate the properties of the radio source under the minimum energy assumption ( e.g. , miley 1980 ) .",
    "we assumed that the relativistic electrons and ions had equal energies , that the radio plasma filled the observed emitting volume , and that the magnetic field was transverse to the line of sight .",
    "the radio spectrum of each component was assumed to be a power law from a frequency of 10 mhz to 100 ghz .",
    "we assumed that the observed lobes were cylinders whose axis is perpendicular to our line of sight .",
    "the implied magnetic field strength was @xmath146 @xmath16 g , the nonthermal pressure was @xmath147 dyne @xmath14 , and the total energy in the lobes was about @xmath148 erg .",
    "the lifetime of the electrons which emit at 1.4 ghz is about @xmath149 yr , which is probably an upper limit to the age of the radio source .",
    "what is the source of the elongated x - ray emission which is extended along the radio structure in figure  [ fig : nvss_pspc ] ?",
    "one possibility is that the radio lobes are interacting with intracluster gas , and have compressed the gas . in this case",
    ", the enhanced x - ray emission would be expected around the perimeter of the radio lobes .",
    "the x - ray and radio spatial resolutions in figure  [ fig : nvss_pspc ] are too poor to provide a useful test of this predictions .",
    "if the radio lobes compressed the surrounding intracluster gas ( either adiabatically or in shocks ) , the gas would have been heated .",
    "actually , the x - ray emission from the x - ray extensions is quite soft (   [ sec : spatial_pspc ] ) , corresponding to a gas temperature of about 0.2 kev .",
    "thus , this model requires that the compressed gas cool to low temperatures .",
    "no evidence of cooling emission is seen in the spectrum of the source (   [ sec : spectra_both ] ) .",
    "the compressed gas would have to be dense enough to cool within the lifetime of the radio source , which would require that @xmath150 @xmath137 .",
    "if the intracluster gas were compressed by strong shocks , its density would only increase by a factor of 4 until cooling was effective .",
    "thus , the ambient gas density in the region around the radio source must exceed @xmath151 @xmath137 for this model to work .",
    "the upper limit on the gas density at the radii of the radio lobes based on the upper limit of the x - ray surface brightness at these radii away from the radio source is @xmath152 @xmath137 .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that such gas could cool rapidly enough to produce the regions of enhanced soft x - ray emission .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray emission may be due to cooler gas which is falling into the central galaxy in a1030 , either alone or as part of the merger of a gas - rich galaxy with the central cd .",
    "west ( 1994 ) suggested that such mergers onto cd galaxies will mainly occur along filaments in the large - scale structure surrounding the cluster , and that they will produce cd galaxies which are prolate in shape .",
    "west argued that gas which falls into such a galaxy will form a disk with its rotation axis being parallel to the major axis of the cd galaxy .",
    "the extended x - ray emission in a1030 is elongated at an angle of about 70@xmath3 from the major axis of the host galaxy of b2  1028 + 313 , which is at a position angle of 45@xmath3 ( ledlow & owen 1995 ) .",
    "thus , this might be consistent with west s scenario .",
    "however , west also argues that the gaseous accretion disk will determine the axis of the central radio jets , which should be perpendicular to the major axis of the gas disk and parallel to the optical major axis of the galaxy .",
    "this gives the wrong relative orientations of the gas disk and radio source and of the optical galaxy and radio source for b2  1028 + 313 .",
    "finally , the extended x - ray emission might be due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by low energy cosmic ray electrons from the radio lobes . as noted above (   [ sec : spatial_pspc ] ) , the extended emission has a very soft x - ray color , which is consistent with a steep power - law x - ray spectrum ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we have calculated the expected ratio of the ic x - ray flux to the synchrotron radio fluxes using the general expressions for the ic and synchrotron emission from power - law electron energy distributions ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ; sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "the ratio of the ic flux at a frequency @xmath153 to the synchrotron flux at a frequency @xmath154 is @xmath155 where @xmath156 k is the temperature of the cmb radiation at zero redshift , @xmath157 is the component of the magnetic field in the radio source perpendicular to our line of sight , @xmath158 is the power - law index of the electron energy distribution , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 are two analytic functions of @xmath161 , which are given in equations  ( 5.8 ) and ( 5.6 ) in sarazin ( 1988 ) .",
    "the power - law electron energy distribution was determined from the radio flux and spectral index @xmath74 of the radio lobes , assuming that the electrons were fit by a single power - law distribution .",
    "given the radio fluxes of the two lobes , the radio spectral index , and assuming a magnetic field of @xmath162 g , the total predicted ic flux density from both of the lobes is 0.3 @xmath16jy at 0.2 kev , which is about a factor of two smaller than the observed total flux of both lobes . because of the uncertainties in all these numbers , it is possible that the extended x - ray emission may be inverse compton emission associated with the radio source .",
    "the ic soft x - ray emission might also be enhanced by scattering of the radio emission from the quasar , particularly if part of that emission is beamed in the same direction as the radio beams .",
    "if the spectral energy distribution of the quasar ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) is extrapolated to the peak of the cmb spectrum , one estimates that the brightness temperature of the radio source is about 1 k at a distance corresponding to a projected radius of 1   from the nucleus .",
    "thus , the local radiation field probably does increase the ic flux somewhat .",
    "one concern with the ic model is that one might expect a more exact correspondence between the extended x - ray and radio features in figure  [ fig : nvss_pspc ] . on the other hand",
    ", the differences might be due to the low spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio of both the x - ray and radio images , or to differences between the distributions of the low energy cosmic rays which produce the ic x - rays and the higher energy particles which produce the synchrotron radio emission .",
    "another concern with the ic model is that it requires that the same very steep spectral index for the radio lobes apply down to very low frequencies , since the electrons which produce the ic soft x - ray emission have much lower energies than those which produce the radio emission .",
    "we thank dan harris , jonathon silverman , and the referee , patrick hall , for useful comments . c. l. s. was supported in part by nasa rosat grants nag 53308 , nag 54787 , nasa asca grant nag 5 - 2526 , and nasa astrophysical theory program grant 5 - 3057 .",
    "partial support for this work was provided by nasa through grant number go-05934.01 - 94a from the stsci , which is operated by aura , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "during pointed observations with _ rosat _ , the satellite is normally `` wobbled '' by several arcmin with a period of several hundred seconds .",
    "the result of this wobbling is that photons from a given location on the sky are collected over an elongated regions of the detector .",
    "figure  [ fig : wobble ] shows the detector coordinate positions of photons from the center of the image of a1030 .",
    "the elongation at @xmath163 is due to the wobble .",
    "the image is reconstructed by determining the pointing direction of the satellite at the arrival time of each of the photons .",
    "morse ( 1994 ) suggested that errors in this aspect solution during the wobble can result in extended and elongated images of point sources .",
    "( note that morse finds that the observed elongations of the images of point sources are nt necessarily in the same direction as the projection of the wobble on the sky , although the elongations are still due to wobble - dependent aspect errors . )",
    "morse argued that aspect errors were correlated with the phase of the wobble , and they might be corrected by registering subimages collected as a function of the wobble phase .",
    "he suggested that subimages be collected from small regions of the detector .",
    "because the extension of a point source in detector coordinates is mainly due to the wobble , this is nearly equivalent to selecting photons at the same phase in the wobble .",
    "morse suggested that regions which were @xmath164 be used .",
    "the subimages must contain at least 100 photons to allow the centroid of each to be determined with sufficient accuracy . even if larger detector regions of @xmath165 are used",
    ", there will typically be @xmath166 such subimages .",
    "thus , this technique requires that the central source in the image contain @xmath167 photons .",
    "we attempted to correct our image for a1030 using the ftools hriaspcor implementation of morse s algorithm .",
    "unfortunately , the central region of our image of a1030 contained about 3000 counts , including background .",
    "we found that this was too few counts to apply morse s algorithm in its original form .",
    "the hriaspcor program produced a highly elongated and irregular image .",
    "we developed a minor variant of the morse algorithm , which can be applied to somewhat fainter sources .",
    "( recently , we found that a similar technique has been used previously by hall et al .",
    "also , as this paper was being revised , we learned of a new technique for improving the aspect solution of hri images , which is presented in harris , silverman , & hasinger [ 1998 ] . in principle , this new technique should work even better than the previous ones , including the one presented here , for relatively faint sources . ) because the wobble is mainly in a single direction , we collect photons into subimages within the detector using long , narrow rectangle regions .",
    "the longer side of these rectangular regions is perpendicular to the direction of the wobble .",
    "figure  [ fig : wobble ] shows the 13 rectangular regions we used to correct the image of a1030 .",
    "the regions are 20 , except for the two at the ends of the wobble which are 40  wide .",
    "we constructed subimages using photons collected from each of these detector regions , determined their centroids , and registered them to a common centroid .",
    "the resulting image of the center of a1030 is shown in figure  [ fig : hri_contour]b .",
    "the center part of this image is narrower than the original image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hri_contour]a ) .",
    "one concern with the morse procedure is that registering subimages of an image will always produce a more compact image , even if the subimages are randomly sampled from the original image . as an extreme example , if the number of subimages equals the number of photons , then the resulting corrected image will be a delta function , whatever the distribution of the original photons . in general , if an image contains @xmath168 photons with a gaussian distribution , and the image is subsampled randomly into @xmath169 subimages each containing @xmath170 photons , then the dispersion of the gaussian distribution will be artificially reduced by a factor of @xmath171^{1/2}$ ] . in our case , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , so this should not be an important effect .",
    "we have verified this by creating random subimages of our image , and we find that they are not significantly different from the original image , and are not as centrally condensed as the wobble - corrected image in figure  [ fig : hri_contour]b .",
    "a second worry is that the distribution of photons on the detector is a convolution of the wobble and the actual spatial distribution of photons on the sky . as a result , registering the subimages",
    "artificially reduces the extent of the resulting image",
    ". however , this effect depends on the ratio of the size of the image on the sky ( @xmath010  for the central part of the a1030 image ) to the size of the wobble ( @xmath05  in figure  [ fig : wobble ] ) , and thus is expected to be quite small ."
