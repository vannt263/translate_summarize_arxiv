    "a number of recent papers @xcite have studied a percolation problem known as accessibility percolation , based on ideas of kauffman and levin for modeling biological evolution @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "accessibility percolation consists of a graph @xmath5 , or more generally a digraph , together with a _ fitness function _",
    "@xmath6 generated according to some random distribution .",
    "this is thought of as representing the landscape of possible evolutionary trajectories of a species .",
    "the vertices in @xmath7 represent the possible genotypes for an organism whose fitness is a measure of how successful an individual of that genotype is , and the edges the possible ways the genome can change subject to a single mutation . here",
    "it makes sense both to consider directed and undirected edges depending on whether or not a certain mutation is reversible . of primary concern",
    "is the existence or distribution of so - called _ accessible _ paths .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be a fitness landscape .",
    "we say that a path @xmath8 in @xmath7 is _ accessible _ if @xmath9 for @xmath10 we say that _ @xmath11 is accessible from @xmath12 _ if there exists an accessible path from @xmath12 to @xmath11 .    for the distribution of @xmath13 we will in this paper consider two variations of kingman s house - of - cards model @xcite .",
    "both of which have previously been considered in accessibility percolation .",
    "in fact , all results in @xcite consider some variation of the house - of - cards model , whereas @xcite and @xcite also consider the so - called rough mount fuji model .",
    "the first model we will consider here is the original formulation of the house - of - cards model , in which the @xmath14:s are independent and @xmath1-distributed for all @xmath15 .",
    "kauffman and levin refers to this as an uncorrelated landscape . for the second distribution",
    "we modify the house - of - cards model by introducing an a priori global fitness maximum @xmath16 by changing @xmath17 to one .",
    "as accessibility percolation only depends on the relative order of fitnesses , this can be seen as equivalent to conditioning the house - of - cards model on @xmath4 being the global fitness maximum .",
    "in particular , if @xmath4 is chosen uniformly at random among @xmath18 , then this is equivalent to the house - of - cards model with @xmath4 denoting the global fitness maximum .",
    "our first main result considers accessibility percolation on the unoriented @xmath0-dimensional binary hypercube .",
    "the question of primary concern is whether or not there exists an accessible path from the all zeroes vertex , @xmath19 , to the fitness maximum @xmath4 .",
    "we prove that , provided @xmath4 is not too close to @xmath19 in hamming distance , the probability that such path exists converges to a non - trivial function of the hamming distance between @xmath4 and @xmath19 divided by @xmath0 , confirming a conjecture by berestycki , brunet and shi @xcite in almost full generality .    as a second result",
    ", we show that accessibility percolation for a general graph can be equivalently formulated in terms of first - passage site percolation .",
    "this lets us reformulate previous results in the literature in terms of first - passage site percolation .",
    "in particular , this relation has important implications for accessibility percolation on trees , as studied in @xcite .",
    "* whenever talking about a general graph @xmath5 , we allow both undirected and directed edges . for vertices",
    "@xmath20 , we write @xmath21 if there is either an undirected edge between @xmath22 and @xmath12 or a directed edge going from @xmath22 to @xmath12 . *",
    "the unoriented @xmath0-dimensional binary hypercube , denoted by @xmath23 , is the graph whose vertices are the binary @xmath0-tuplets @xmath24 and where two vertices share an edge if their hamming distance is one .",
    "the oriented @xmath0-dimensional binary hypercube , @xmath25 , is the directed graph obtained by directing each edge in @xmath23 towards the vertex with more ones .",
    "* for a vertex @xmath12 in the hypercube we let @xmath26 denote the number of coordinates of @xmath12 that are one . addition and subtraction of vertices in @xmath23 denotes coordinate - wise addition / subtraction modulo two .",
    "we let @xmath19 and @xmath27 denote the all zeroes and all ones vertices respectively , and let @xmath28 denote the standard basis . *",
    "often when considering the house - of - cards model , it is useful to condition on the fitness of @xmath19 .",
    "following the convention in @xcite , for any @xmath29 $ ] we let @xmath30 and @xmath31 $ ] denote conditional probability and expectation respectively , given @xmath32 .",
    "let us take a moment to summarize the results for accessibility percolation on the binary hypercube with house - of - cards fitnesses in @xcite .",
    "we start by consider the simplified version of the problem where we replace @xmath23 by @xmath25 .",
    "this is equivalent to only considering paths without backwards mutations .",
    "as any coordinate where @xmath4 is zero will be constantly zero along any such path , it suffices to consider the case where @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the number of oriented paths from @xmath19 to @xmath27 which are accessible .",
    "as there are @xmath35 oriented paths from @xmath19 to @xmath27 , and each path is accessible if and only if the @xmath0 random fitnesses along the path are in ascending order , we see that @xmath36 . at first glance",
    ", this may seem to imply a positive probability of accessible paths existing .",
    "however , a much clearer picture of what occurs is obtained by conditioning on the fitness of the starting vertex .",
    "indeed , conditioned on the fitness of @xmath19 being @xmath29 $ ] , we have @xmath37 we see that , for large @xmath0 , this expression is @xmath38 approximately at @xmath39 , and rapidly decreasing as @xmath40 increases . informally",
    ", this means that unless the fitness of the starting vertex is below @xmath41 , accessible paths are highly unlikely .",
    "in fact , by considering a bit more closely it follows that @xmath42 . on the other hand , the regime where @xmath40 is smaller than @xmath41 turns out to be more difficult to treat . in @xcite",
    "it was shown by hegarty and the author that the probability of accessible paths in this case tends to @xmath38 as @xmath3 .",
    "[ thm : hegartymartinsson](hegarty , martinsson ) for any sequence @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , as @xmath45 we have @xmath46 furthermore , @xmath47    this theorem was later strengthened by berestycki , brunet and shi in @xcite who proved that , in the special case where @xmath48 , @xmath34 has a non - trivial limit distribution when scaled appropriately .",
    "let us now switch back to the unoriented hypercube and see how this analysis changes .",
    "again , let @xmath34 denote the number of accessible paths from @xmath19 to @xmath4 . here , paths are not as combinatorially well - behaved as for the oriented cube , and first moment estimates are not as easy to come by . nevertheless , in a recent paper by berestycki , brunet and shi @xcite it was shown that @xmath49 has the following asymptotic behavior :    [ thm : berestyckiex](berestycki , brunet , shi ) let @xmath50 $ ] be fixed , and let @xmath51 be such that @xmath52 exists .",
    "we have that as @xmath3 @xmath53 as a consequence , for each @xmath54 there is a critical value @xmath55 for the fitness of @xmath19 , given by the unique non - negative solution to @xmath56 such that    * for @xmath57 , @xmath58 goes to @xmath59 exponentially fast as @xmath3 . * for @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath49 diverges exponentially fast as @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the unconditioned probability that @xmath61 is at most @xmath62 .    we see a similar behavior of @xmath49 as for the oriented cube .",
    "one important difference though is that unlike the oriented cube the critical value has a nontrivial limit as @xmath3 .",
    "the function @xmath63 is plotted in figure [ fig : varthetax ] . this function is continuous and increasing where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in particular",
    ", it follows that if the a priori global fitness maximum is @xmath27 , then the critical fitness is @xmath66 , and if chosen uniformly at random then @xmath67 will be tightly concentrated around @xmath68 and hence the critical fitness is @xmath69 .     as defined in . ]",
    "berestycki et al . further gave two conjectures that `` tells the truth '' in the sense that @xmath70 tends to @xmath38 as @xmath3 for @xmath71 .",
    "conjecture 1 of their paper proposes this in the special case where @xmath33 , and conjecture 2 in the more general setting of @xmath72 satisfying @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "the first result of this paper fully resolves conjecture 1 by berestycki , brunet and shi @xcite , and conjecture 2 under the additional condition that @xmath54 is not too small .",
    "[ thm : mainresult1 ] let @xmath51 be a sequence of vertices such that @xmath74 exists .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the number of accessible paths from @xmath19 to @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath63 be as defined in theorem [ thm : berestyckiex ] .",
    "assuming @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 in particular , if @xmath33 , then @xmath77 and if @xmath4 is chosen uniformly at random , then @xmath78    the value @xmath79 deserves some explanation . in the proof of theorem [ thm : mainresult1 ] , or",
    "more accurately the proof of theorem [ thm : mainresult1equiv ] below which is shown to be equivalent to the former , we see that there is a value @xmath80 such that the proof goes through whenever @xmath81 and breaks down when @xmath82 , see remark [ rem : breakdown ] .",
    "it seems likely however that this is simply an artifact of the technique used in the proof , and that the statement should hold true even for smaller @xmath54 .",
    "regardless of whether or not this is true , we can note that the two cases of most concern , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are far above @xmath85 .",
    "we now turn to the relation between accessibility percolation and first - passage site percolation for a general graph .",
    "let @xmath5 be a graph with a distinguished vertex @xmath19 .",
    "note that each edge of @xmath7 may either be directed or undirected . for each vertex",
    "@xmath86 randomly assign a cost , denoted by @xmath87 , according to independent @xmath1 random variables .",
    "for a path @xmath88 in @xmath7 we define the site passage time of the path by @xmath89 and similarly define its reduced site passage time by @xmath90 note that neither the passage time nor the reduced passage time of a path include the cost of the first vertex . for each @xmath91",
    "we define the site first - passage time from @xmath22 to @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath92 , and the reduced first passage time from @xmath22 to @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath93 , as the minimum of the respective quantity over all paths from @xmath22 to @xmath12 .",

    "conditioned on the fitness of @xmath19 being @xmath40 , the set of vertices accessible from @xmath19 has the same distribution as the set of vertices @xmath12 such that @xmath97 .",
    "informally we can think of this theorem as saying that accessibility percolation is equivalent to first - passage site percolation with independent @xmath1 vertex passage times .",
    "we need to be a bit careful there though ; the theorem only deals with the question of whether or not a certain vertex is accessible from @xmath19 along any path , and it does not for instance say anything about the number of accessible paths .",
    "indeed , it is not true in general that the number of accessible paths from @xmath19 to @xmath12 is distributed as the number of paths from @xmath19 to @xmath12 with reduced passage time at most @xmath98 . for graphs containing non - simple paths",
    "this is clear as non - simple paths can have arbitrarily small passage time but can not be accessible , but it can even be false for directed acyclic graphs , see for instance figure [ fig : smownam ] . on the other hand , the connection is more general than just treating which vertices are accessible .",
    "for instance , using the proof ideas in section [ sec : proofbondsitemainresult2 ] one can show that the minimal number of times you need to move to a less fit vertex to get from @xmath19 to @xmath12 is distributed as the integer part of @xmath99 .",

    "however , a common property for percolation problems is that it is harder to percolate on vertices than edges @xcite .",

    "accessibility percolation on trees has been considered in @xcite . with the exception of @xcite",
    ", these articles have considered regular rooted trees with degree @xmath0 and height @xmath106 , and where fitnesses are assigned according to the house - of - cards model conditioned on the fitness of the root being zero . of principal concern",
    "is how the number of vertices in generation @xmath106 that are accessible from the root varies as a function of @xmath0 , and in particular whether this number is non - zero .",
    "using theorem [ thm : mainresult2 ] we can see that this is equivalent to assigning independent @xmath1 passage times to the edges of the tree and considering the number of vertices @xmath12 in generation @xmath106 such that @xmath107 .",
    "in particular , the question of whether generation @xmath106 is accessible from @xmath19 is equivalent to to asking if the first - passage time from the root to generation @xmath106 is at most @xmath38 .",
    "it should be mentioned however that the usual setting in first - passage percolation on regular rooted trees keeps @xmath0 fixed and considers the first - passage time from the root to generation @xmath106 as @xmath108 .",
    "while the author is not aware of any results from this field that have appropriate error bounds to be directly applicable to accessibility percolation , there seems to be a significant overlap of ideas between @xcite and the literature on first - passage percolation on trees .",

    "let us now consider the implications of theorem [ thm : mainresult2 ] for the hypercube . using this result",

    "it was shown that for the oriented hypercube , we have @xmath115 in probability as @xmath3 . in a more recent result by the author @xcite , it was shown that for the unoriented hypercube @xmath116 as @xmath3 . strictly speaking these results",
    "assume standard exponential edge weights , but it is not too hard to show that the limiting distribution of @xmath117 only depends on the weight distribution as the righthand limit of its probability distribution function at @xmath59 , hence it will be the same for @xmath1 weights",
    ".    the remainder of the paper will be structured as follows : in section [ sec : proofbondsitemainresult2 ] we prove proposition [ prop : bondsite ] and theorem [ thm : mainresult2 ] .",
    "the remaining sections , sections [ sec : uncontestedctp ] , [ sec : calculus ] and [ sec : bootstrap ] , are dedicated to the proof of theorem [ thm : mainresult1equiv ] .",
    "we may , without loss of generality , assume that for any vertex @xmath12 there exists a path from @xmath19 to @xmath12 .",
    "a key idea of the proofs of proposition [ prop : bondsite ] and theorem [ thm : mainresult2 ] is the following procedure for computing @xmath118 .",
    "we initially consider @xmath118 to be unassigned for each @xmath12 , except @xmath19 for which it is set to @xmath59 , and we let @xmath119 denote the set of vertices with assigned first - passage times . until @xmath118 is assigned for all @xmath12 , we do the following operation :    1 .",
    "find a pair of vertices @xmath120 that minimizes @xmath121 subject to @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath125 3 .",
    "add @xmath12 to @xmath126 .    to see that this assigns first - passage times correctly",
    ", suppose that we are in the step where @xmath118 is assigned . as @xmath12 is not in @xmath126 , the passage time of any path from @xmath19 to @xmath12 must include the passage time from @xmath19 to some vertex @xmath127 in @xmath126 adjacent to some vertex outside @xmath126 , as well as the cost @xmath12 .",
    "hence @xmath128 . as there is a path from @xmath19 to @xmath12 with passage time @xmath129",
    ", this must be optimal .",
    "hence , if all previous assignments are correct , @xmath118 will be assigned correctly as well .",
    "we can modify this algorithm to run on first - passage bond percolation by replacing @xmath87 by the weight of the edge from @xmath22 to @xmath12 . in either case , as no vertex cost or edge weight respectively is accessed more than once , the accessed values form a sequence of independent and @xmath1 random variables .",
    "hence the distribution of @xmath118 is unaffected .",
    "on the other hand , for bond percolation we get that @xmath118 is the edge passage time of some path from @xmath19 to @xmath12 ( but not necessarily the shortest ) .",
    "we now turn to the proof of theorem [ thm : mainresult2 ] .",
    "the coupling between first - passage site percolation and accessibility percolation we will consider is essentially to let @xmath130 be the fitness function , where @xmath131 denotes the fractional part of @xmath54",
    ". we will however modify this slightly by putting @xmath132 whenever @xmath133 .",
    "it is clear that the probability of such @xmath12 other than @xmath19 existing is @xmath59 , so the only way this will change the distribution of @xmath134 is that @xmath135 if @xmath136 .",
    "it is not too hard to see that , for any vertex @xmath12 except @xmath19 , @xmath137 is @xmath1-distributed .",
    "the following lemma shows that the @xmath137:s are also independent , hence showing that @xmath134 is distributed according to the house - of - cards model without an a priori global fitness maximum , conditioned on @xmath138 .",
    "[ lemma : alphaequiv3 ] @xmath137 are independent @xmath1 random variables for @xmath139 .",

    "it is clear that the @xmath87:s are independent and @xmath1-distributed .",
    "the lemma follows by noting that , in the latter case , we have @xmath142 almost surely for all @xmath143 .",

    ", we will mimic the argument in @xcite for first - passage bond percolation on @xmath23 .",
    "let us take a moment to describe some of the underlying machinery for first - passage bond percolation on @xmath23 .",
    "we assume independent standard exponential edge weights . in @xcite",
    ", durrett introduced the following process , which he called the the _ branching translation process _",
    ", btp : at time @xmath59 we place one particle at @xmath19 in @xmath23 .",
    "the system then evolves by each existing particle independently generating offspring at each vertex adjacent to its position at rate @xmath38 .",
    "one can show that for each vertex @xmath164 , the time at which the first particle at @xmath12 is born is stochastically dominated by @xmath165 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the btp dominates the so - called richardson s model .",
    "the strategy in @xcite is basically to show that , with a certain coupling , there is a probability bounded away from zero of these quantities being equal .    in order to translate this approach to first - passage site percolation",
    ", we need to find a corresponding process to the btp for this case .",
    "we claim that the following is such a process : we initially have a finite number of particles , each located at a vertex in @xmath23 . for each particle",
    ", we assign an independent poisson clock with unit rate .",
    "when a particle s clock goes off , it simultaneously generates one new offspring at each vertex adjacent to its position .",
    "the new particles are then assigned new poisson clocks and the process continues .",
    "we will refer to this process as the clustering translation process , ctp .",
    "we see that in both the btp and ctp each particle generates offspring at each neighboring vertex at rate @xmath38 .",
    "a big difference however is that in the btp this is done independently for each neighboring vertex , whereas in the ctp a particle generates offspring all neighboring vertices simultaneously .",
    "another difference is that the initial state of the ctp is not fixed",
    ".    the most important initial state of the ctp will be one particle at each neighbor of @xmath19 .",
    "we will refer to a ctp initialized in this way as a _ standard _",
    "particles born due to the same poisson clock tick will be referred to as _ identical @xmath0-tuplets_. to simplify terminology we will also consider the initial @xmath0 particles in a standard ctp as identical @xmath0-tuplets .",
    "below we will use the terms _ ancestor _ and _ descendant _ of a particle to denote the natural partial order of particles generated by the ctp . for convenience ,",
    "we say that a particle is both an ancestor and a descendant of itself .",
    "the terms _ parent _ and _ child _ are defined in the natural way .",
    "the @xmath166 of a particle @xmath54 is the ordered set of ancestors of @xmath54 , and we say that the ancestral line of @xmath54 _ follows the path @xmath167 _ if the location of the ancestors of @xmath54 in chronological order is given by @xmath168 . note that this path always starts at @xmath19 even though the first ancestor is located at a neighbor of @xmath19 .",
    "we say that a particle @xmath54 _ originates from a particle @xmath169 at a time @xmath170 _ if @xmath169 is the last particle in the ancestral line of @xmath54 that exists at time @xmath170 .",
    "we can immediately note some properties of this process .",
    "firstly , it is markovian .",
    "secondly , let @xmath171 be a set of vertices in @xmath23 , and let @xmath172 denote the expected number of particles at vertex @xmath12 at time @xmath173 in the ctp initialized by placing one particle at each vertex in @xmath171 .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath172 must solve the initial value problem @xmath174 in particular , if @xmath175 , then the unique solution to this problem is @xmath176 and it follows by linearity that for any @xmath171 , we have @xmath177 recall that addition / subtraction of vertices in @xmath23 are interpreted as coordinate - wise addition / subtraction modulo @xmath178 .",
    "it should be remarked that the exact same analysis holds for the btp .",
    "we now show that the standard ctp indeed has the desired relation to first - passage site percolation . to this end",
    ", we partition the particles in this process into two sets , the set of _ alive _ particles and the set of _",
