    "if @xmath0 is an @xmath1-dimensional subspace of an @xmath2-dimensional riemannian space @xmath3 then @xmath0 will inherit a metric from its embedding in @xmath3 . consider a pair of points @xmath4 and @xmath5 on @xmath0 chosen sufficiently close to ensure that there exists a unique geodesic in @xmath0 connecting @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "if necessary , the points @xmath4 and @xmath5 could be further constrained to ensure that a unique geodesic , this time lying in @xmath3 , also connects @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "a natural question to pose would be  how are the arc - lengths of the two geodesics related ? this is a simple question and as shown below rather easy to answer .",
    "we will show that the difference between the arc - lengths is ( not surprisingly ) controlled by the embedding of @xmath0 in @xmath3 , that is , the difference can be expressed solely in terms of the second fundamental form of @xmath0 .",

    ". then @xmath17 however @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath12 . substituting ( [ eqn:3dperp ] ) into ( [ eqn:3dgeod ] )",
    "while also using @xmath20 and @xmath21 leads to @xmath22 comparing this equation with ( [ eqn:3dgeod ] ) leads directly to ( [ eqn:3d4dconn ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath11 can be viewed as a second connection on @xmath3 constructed so that it admits geodesics lying solely within @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath3 be an @xmath2-dimensional manifold with a riemannian metric @xmath6 .",
    "consider an @xmath1-dimensional subspace @xmath0 of @xmath3 and let @xmath7 be the metric induced on @xmath0 by the embedding of @xmath0 in @xmath8 . consider a pair of nearby points @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath0 chosen so that they are connected by a pair of unique geodesics , one in @xmath15 and the other in @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the arc - length from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in @xmath8 and likewise let @xmath24 be the arc - length in @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the second fundamental form for @xmath0 and @xmath26 the unit - tanget to the geodesic in @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath27    we begin by constructing a local set of riemann normal coordinates @xmath28 that covers a subset of @xmath3 containing the two points @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the assumption that there is a unique geodesic in @xmath3 that connects @xmath4 and @xmath5 ensures that such a set of coordinates can be constructed .",
    "we are free to locate the origin of the coordinates to be at @xmath4 and also to align the coordinates axes so that one axis is parallel to the geodesic connecting @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "let that axis be the @xmath29 axis .",
    "then the coordinates of @xmath4 are @xmath30 while for @xmath5 we have @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath28 do not provide a set of riemann normal coordinates on @xmath0 .",
    "however in a new set of coordinates @xmath32 in the neighbourhood of @xmath4 given by @xmath33 it is easy to verify that the connection components at @xmath4 satisfy @xmath34 and thus the @xmath32 , when restricted to @xmath0 , serve as a set of riemann normal coordinates on @xmath0 . in the @xmath32",
    "coordinates we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the choice of riemann normal coordinates is motived by the following simple expression for the geodesic arc - length @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the riemann curvature components evaluated at @xmath4 and where @xmath40 .",
    "there are two geodesics to be considered .",
    "they both join @xmath4 to @xmath5 but one uses the connection @xmath11 while the other uses @xmath12 .",
    "the squared arc - lengths for this pair of geodesics can be found using ( [ eqn : lsqgeod ] ) leading to @xmath41 now we can combine equations ( [ eqn:3d4dconn ] ) and ( [ eqn:3drnca ] ) and substitute the result into ( [ eqn:3dlsq ] ) to obtain @xmath42 now recall that @xmath43 and thus @xmath44 where @xmath26 is a unit vector from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "thus we can re - write the previous equation as @xmath45 which completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be the unit normal vectors on @xmath0 at points @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . then @xmath48    since the connection @xmath12 vanishes at @xmath4 we have @xmath49 but @xmath50 thus we also have @xmath51 the vector @xmath14 , which is tangent to the geodesic in @xmath8 connecting @xmath4 to @xmath5 , is in general not tangent to the geodesic in @xmath15 .",
    "it can however be written as a linear combination of a vectors parallel and perpendicular to @xmath0 at @xmath4 .",
    "that is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are numbers yet to be determined and @xmath55 is the unit tangent vector to the geodesic in @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are close then @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "substituting this into the previous equation leads to @xmath58 now we can use @xmath59 to obtain @xmath60 multipling through by @xmath23 and using @xmath61 we see that ( [ eqn : main ] ) can be written as @xmath62 which completes the proof .",
    "consider a one parameter family of hypersurfaces generated from @xmath0 by dragging @xmath0 along its unit normal @xmath2 .",
    "this family forms a local foliation of @xmath3 in which the points @xmath4 and @xmath5 are now viewed as functions along the integral curves of @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath63 where @xmath2 ( not to be confused with the unit normal ) is the arc length measured along the integral curves of the unit normal .",
    "the equation for the first variation of arc states that @xmath64_p^q\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the unit tangent vector to the geodesic in @xmath8 .",
    "but in our riemann normal coordinates we have @xmath65 and thus we also have @xmath66 which leads to @xmath67 combining this with the previous corollary completes the proof .",
    "it is common practice in computer graphics to model a smooth 2-dimensional surfaces such as a sphere , a torus or even teapots by a finite collection of connected triangles .",
    "the vertices of the triangles are taken as sample points of the smooth surface while the legs are taken as geodesics of the flat 3-dimensional space in which the surface resides .",
    "this discrete approximation to the smooth surface is commonly known as a triangulation .",
    "one of the more important quantities associated with any 2-dimensional surface is the gaussian curvature .",
    "this is usually computed by taking various derivatives on a smooth surface .",
    "yet that is clearly not possible on a triangulation ( as a smooth function ) since the local metric is at best piecewise constant .",
    "nonetheless it seems reasonable to expect that where a triangulation closely approximates a smooth surface then the curvature on the triangulation should be close to the curvature of the smooth surface .",
    "how then can such a curvature on a triangulation be computed ? various methods ( )",
    "have been developed over the years that broadly speaking divide into two approaches . in one approach a smooth surface",
    "is interpolated through the vertices which in turn allows the curvature to be computed using standard methods ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "the other approach uses area weighted sums to estimate the local curvature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that for the case where 4 triangles meet at a vertex the estimated gaussian curvature need not converge to the correct value ( as the triangulation is refined towards a continuum limit ) . here",
    "we shall demonstrate that failure for the simple case of four identical triangles on a 2-sphere .",
    "we will also show that the correct convergent estimate of the curvature can be recovered by using an adjusted set of leg lengths given by the main theorem .",
    "the gaussian curvature on a unit 2-sphere @xmath68 in @xmath69 is 1 everywhere on @xmath68 .",
    "consider now any point @xmath4 on @xmath68 enclosed by 4 equally spaced points @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 also on @xmath68 .",
    "this set of points can be connected to form 4 triangles attached to @xmath4 as indicated in figure ( [ fig : sphere ] ) .",
    "the gaussian curvature at @xmath4 will be estimated by solving the coupled system of equations @xmath74 for the riemann normal coordinates @xmath75 for each vertex @xmath76 and the riemann components @xmath77 at @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath78 are the squared arc - lengths between vertices @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in the first instance",
    "we will take the @xmath81 to be the euclidian arc - length given by the embedding of the vertices in @xmath69 .",
    "later we will adjust the @xmath81 by using equation ( [ eqn : corollary2 ] ) .",
    "the symmetry of the 2-sphere allows us to choose all triangles to be identical and to also choose the cartesian and riemann coordinates of each vertex as per table ( [ tbl : spherecoords ] ) . with this choice of coordinates the equations ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) can be reduced to just two equations , namely @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the gaussian curvature at @xmath4 .",
    "the constraint that the points lie on the unit sphere leads to just one equation @xmath84 thus we have three equations for four unknowns @xmath85 and @xmath25 .",
    "clearly we can choose @xmath86 as a free parameter which leads to the following solution for @xmath25 @xmath87 this shows clearly that as the set of points converge to @xmath4 the estimate for @xmath25 converges to the incorrect value of @xmath88 .",
    "this is a well known result and is not germain to the use of riemann normal coordinates ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".the cartesian and riemann normal coordinates of the 5 vertices .",
    "this choices makes full use of the known symmetries of the 2-sphere .",
    "the size of the triangles is controlled by the freely chosen coordinate @xmath86 while @xmath90 is set by the contraint that the points lie on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "the riemann normal coordinate @xmath91 and the gaussian curvature can then be computed from the leg - lengths as described in the text .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is not hard to show the fractional error in using @xmath92 as an approximation to @xmath93 is subject to the following bounds @xmath94 but since the total area of the triangulation @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 while the total area of the cylinder is @xmath97 we see that @xmath98 this clearly shows that for the total error to vanish we need not only @xmath99 but also @xmath100 .",
    "if these two conditions are not satisfied then the total area of the triangulation need not converge to that of the cylinder ( and can even diverge to infinity ) .",
    "we will now repeat the above calculation but this time using an adjusted set of @xmath78 given by ( [ eqn : corollary1 ] ) . the normal vector for any point on a cylinder of unit radius is easily computed . for example , for any point on the cylinder with",
    "coordinates @xmath101 the unit normal vector at that point has components @xmath102 .",
    "this allows us to easily apply equation ( [ eqn : corollary1 ] ) to estimate the @xmath103 on the cylinder .",
    "note also that since the cylinder has zero gaussian curvature we can use the standard euclidian formula for the area of triangle . thus we have @xmath104     { \\tilde l}^2_{pq } & = { \\bar l}^2_{pq }                        + \\frac{1}{12}\\left(n_\\mu(p)-n_\\mu(q))\\delta x^\\mu_{pq}\\right)^2\\\\[5pt ]     { \\tilde a}^2_{pqr } & = \\frac { 1}{16}{\\tilde l}^2_{pr}\\left(4{\\tilde l}^2_{pq }                                                               -{\\tilde l}^2_{pr}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these estimates for @xmath105 we find the following error bounds for the total area @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the total area of the triangulation ( using the adjusted arc - lengths ) . as with the previous example",
    ", @xmath107 will converge to @xmath0 only when @xmath99 while @xmath108 .",
    "but note that when @xmath108 the errors bounds are of order @xmath109 whereas in the previous example ( using euclidian arc - lengths ) the errors were of order @xmath110 .",
    "this is a considerable improvement ."
