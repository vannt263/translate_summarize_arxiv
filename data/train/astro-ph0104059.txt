    "the he - strong bp stars are a subclass of early - type b stars with an array of remarkable properties , chief among which are their oblique dipolar magnetic fields , magnetically controlled winds , and chemical surface anomalies ( e.g. bohlender et al .",
    "@xcite , bohlender @xcite , bolton @xcite , shore @xcite ) .",
    "these conditions provide a rich testbed for the study of magnetic and hydrodynamical processes on these stars and conceivably on stars of related active o- and b - subclasses in which wind and photospheric line variability has so far gone undiagnosed .",
    "several seminal papers on the he - strong star @xmath1orie have demonstrated that several peculiarities in the ultraviolet spectrum of this star can be explained by circumstellar clouds forced into co - rotation over the magnetic equator .",
    "for example , groote & hunger ( @xcite ) showed that high - level balmer lines appear at certain rotational phases , demonstrating the presence of an occulting , comparatively low - density gas .",
    "this circumstellar medium can also be observed as periodically modulated h@xmath2 emissions ( e.g. , short & bolton @xcite ) .",
    "using spectra from the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ satellite , shore and collaborators ( shore & brown @xcite ( sb90 ) , shore et al .",
    "@xcite ) demonstrated that a common property of winds in both he - strong and he - weak bp stars is that they are channeled by a dipolar magnetic field to a torus - shaped magnetosphere ( cloud ) located over the magnetic equator .",
    "this torus may well be be located in a different volume than the _ plasmasphere _ suggested by radio studies ( havnes & goertz @xcite , drake et al . @xcite and drake @xcite ) , but it is likely to be related . following",
    "the initial ideas of shore ( @xcite ) , babel & montmerle ( @xcite ) and babel ( @xcite ) have discussed a model in which shocks are excited at the wind - torus interface , creating high energy emission .",
    "the magnetic and rotational axes of these stars are separated by seemingly arbitrary angles . in most cases",
    "this angle is large enough to provide an opportunity to observe the time - variability of emission and absorption components of the strong lines and thus to study the azimuthal structure of the clouds as the wind - cloud complex co - rotates",
    ". while these variations are often large and complex , all indications are that they are rather stable over decades ( e.g. , sb90 , bolton @xcite , henrichs et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    henrichs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) recently proposed the existence of a distinct new class of _ magnetic rotators _ ( hereinafter , _ rotating magnetic b stars _ ) .",
    "the three stars so far assigned to this group , @xmath0cep ( hd205021 ) , hr6684 ( hd163472 ) , and hd184927 , are characterized by redshifted emissions of the civ resonance lines . to this small class",
    ", we would add the extensively studied , he - strong star @xmath1orie .",
    "the siiv and civ resonance lines of this star also show redshifted emissions at phases of magnetic extrema ( bohlender et al .",
    "we have examined the sequences of civ and nv resonance profiles in three he - strong stars in the sb90 sample with known rotational periods ( hd37017 , hd37776 , hd64740 ) and find that each exhibits phase - correlated redshifted emissions .",
    "an examination of _ newsips_-processed spectra of hd36385 and hd133518 shows that the civ resonance lines in these stars spectra also exhibit variable , redshifted emissions .",
    "the periodic emissions of the nv and civ lines of the hot o7v star @xmath3 oric are well known .",
    "walborn & nichols ( @xcite ) and gagn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have suggested that this star is a hot analog to the bp stars . because of the similar variabilities of the red halves of their civ , nv profiles , it is likely that these stars , and indeed perhaps all he - strong variables , should be included in this new class .    in this paper",
    "we provide the first detailed analysis of spectral lines to determine conditions in co - rotating clouds attached to the rotating magnetic b stars .",
    "we undertake this study by using ultraviolet lines obtained entirely from archival echellograms obtained with the _ iue _ satellite .",
    "we have three specific goals : ( 1 ) to estimate physical parameters of clouds ( temperature , density , extent , metallicity , and turbulence ) , ( 2 ) to study the relevance of _ bp - like _ surface chemical composition ( metal - depletion ) on cloud properties , and ( 3 ) to examine the processes responsible for resonance line emissions and anomalous absorptions at certain phases .    for these purposes",
    "we have chosen the first four stars discussed above : @xmath1orie ( the most well studied he - strong star ) , hd184927 ( a sharp - lined , magnetic he - strong star ; wade et al .",
    "@xcite ) ) , @xmath0cep ( a composition - normal star with magnetic wind properties similar to the he - strong stars ; it is also the prototype of the @xmath0cephei pulsational variables ) , and hr6684 ( a @xmath0cephei variable with a moderate rotational velocity ; jerzykiewicz @xcite , kubiak & seggewiss @xcite ) .",
    "these last two stars are pulsators and are not he - strong stars .",
    "the selection of these four stars was guided in part by our desire to include both intrinsically slow ( @xmath0cep ) and moderately rapid rotators ( @xmath1orie and hr6684 ) , as well as stars observed at both low and high aspect angles .",
    "@xmath0cep and @xmath1orie are probably intrinsically moderate and rapid rotators , respectively , viewed nearly equator - on .",
    "hd184927 is an intrinsically slow rotator viewed at low inclination .",
    "less is known abut hr6684 , but its low @xmath4sin@xmath5 and possible rotation period near 3.75 days ( henrichs et al .",
    "@xcite ) , suggest that it is a moderate rotator observed at low inclination , an interpretation supported by the single - wave variations of its magnetic and optical hei line variations ( wade et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to describe the geometry of the magnetospheres ,",
    "it is important that the sample of stars studied has a variety of rotational velocities and be viewed from a range of inclination angles .",
    "the _ iue _ data for this program were the newsips - extracted , large - aperture high dispersion spectral files from the short wavelength prime ( swp ) camera .",
    "these were downloaded from the mast data archive .",
    "the data used were all the _ iue _ swp / large - aperture images for @xmath1orie ( 29 ) , hd184927 ( 30 ) , @xmath0cephei ( 31 ) , and hr6684 ( 41 ) , except that for @xmath1orie the images swp04840 and swp27259 were excluded .",
    "the latter spectra were observed at isolated times and thus do not lend themselves to analysis of short - term variations .",
    "the high - dispersion swp - camera data for both newsips and iuesips are known to depend on errors in echelle _",
    "ripple _ correction and background subtraction .",
    "ripple - correction errors were avoided by working with net flux data for individual echelle orders . to account for background extraction errors ( smith @xcite )",
    ", we derived corrections first in the @xmath0cep and hd184927 spectra by forcing the depths of the siiii , siiv , civ , and occasionally other resonance lines to zero .",
    "this procedure was generally insensitive to rotation because most of the resonance lines we studied reside well up on the flat or even damping parts of their curves of growth , and their line cores are well broadened by saturation .",
    "the zero - point corrections we derived were typically 510% of the continuum level . for lines in short - wavelength orders , we interpolated corrections from the ly@xmath2 and other nearby orders .",
    "we used a suite of codes written by i. hubeny and collaborators to compute model line profiles to compare with the iue data .",
    "the first code is _ synspec _ , a spectral line synthesis code developed for input non - lte or line - blanketed model atmospheres by hubeny et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we used standard lte atmospheres by kurucz ( @xcite ) in our work .",
    "_ synspec _ is embedded within an idl wrapper ( hubeny @xcite ) such that we could easily calculate spectra with a variety of trial atmospheric abundances .",
    "_ synspec _ was then run to generate synthetic spectra similar to the observed ones by computing a disk - integrated , rotationally broadened spectrum and to convolve it to the spectral resolution ( 13000 ) of high dispersion _ iue _ spectra .",
    "our principal objective in this paper is to assess the effect of torus - shaped magnetospheric clouds on a star s spectral lines ( shore & brown @xcite ) as they alternatively move onto and off the projected stellar surface . to simulate the signatures of a cloud on the composite spectrum",
    ", we used the hubeny _ circus _ program ( hubeny @xcite , hubeny & heap @xcite ) .",
    "this code was written to compute line absorptions and/or emissions of a gas cloud situated either in front or off the limb of a reference star .",
    "_ circus _ requires the user to specify physical cloud parameters such as temperature , density , geometry , composition , microturbulence , column depth , and areal coverage factor . although the code can accommodate as many as three separate clouds we considered only a single homogeneous cloud in nearly all our simulations . in its solution of the radiative transfer equation within a cloud , _ circus _ computes line emissions and absorptions separately",
    "this feature can be used to compute the cloud spectrum either in lte ( adding differential emission and absorption terms ) or in the two - level non - lte approximation , in which only the absorption terms are calculated .",
    "the code proceeds by first consulting a kurucz ( @xcite ) line library of atomic absorption parameters and computing an opacity spectrum for a user - specified temperature and electron density .",
    "the spectra were computed at a spacing of 0.01 angstroms , which oversamples the contributing lines . the optical depth in each line can then be determined using an input column density .",
    "the surface of the star is divided into a 100@xmath6100 grid and the local intensity spectrum is evaluated at each grid point , thereby taking into account the effects of foreshortening and limb darkening .",
    "typically , we computed _ circus _ models in pairs .",
    "in the first case we assumed that a square cloud occults the stellar disk . in the second , we allowed the position of the cloud to shift off the projected stellar disk so that it contributed only line emission to the spectrum .",
    "the dimensions of real clouds near a magnetic b star are actually likely to be much larger than one stellar radius ( hunger et al .",
    "@xcite , bolton @xcite ) .",
    "thus , _ we expect that our treatment underestimates the total effects of emission at non - occultation phases .",
    "_ however , since we modeled only differences in line strengths between occultation and non - occultation phases , this fact is not relevant to our analysis .",
    "the density and areal coverage factors of the cloud are necessary but not critical parameters in our analysis . for our initial models we started with a trial volume density of 10@xmath7 @xmath8 , based on the appearance of high balmer series members during the occultation phases of @xmath1orie ( groote & hunger @xcite , short & bolton @xcite ) . from the resulting column densities ( @xmath9[specphot ] ) and an estimate of @xmath10 for the extent of the cloud in the line of sight from these authors , we derived a mean density of @xmath1135@xmath12 @xmath8 . as a compromise we chose a density of 1@xmath13 @xmath8 , which we used in our models .",
    "the results of this study are not very sensitive to the electron density for the range considered .",
    "_ circus _ includes a provision for various doppler effects .",
    "the most important of these is stellar rotation , which _ circus _ treats by shifting the local intensity spectrum by a wavelength equivalent to the projected doppler shift at each point on the disk .",
    "the program computes the net doppler velocity between each projected element of the cloud and the background star along the observer s line of sight . in our model",
    "there are no differential velocities between regions of the cloud along the line of sight and the projected area on the star because the cloud is co - rotating . additionally , because microturbulence can be an additional factor in determining the signatures of a cloud on a spectrum , we varied this as a free parameter .",
    "in general , values less than 20 kms@xmath14 resulted in similar cloud absorption / emission spectra , so we used this value as a default .",
    "to date only a few models of the dynamics of rotating magnetic b stars have been discussed for he - variable stars . of these most work",
    "has focused on @xmath1orie .",
    "borrowing from work of groote & hunger ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; hunger & groote @xcite ; hunger et al .",
    "@xcite ) , shore and brown ( @xcite ) , babel & montmerle ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and babel ( @xcite ) , this prototype and probably all he - variable stars exhibit variations because they have dipolar fields which are inclined to some extent with respect to their magnetic axes . there is now a broad consensus that closed magnetic loops from the two poles divert a weak wind emerging from these surface regions .",
    "the particles emanating from opposite poles collide at high velocity and form a torus - shaped magnetosphere .",
    "the particles eventually leak out through the outer edge of the torus ( defined by the alfvn radius ) and also settle back to the star  to what relative extents is still unclear .",
    "the radiative wind theory of springmann & pauldrach ( @xcite ) suggests that there is a tendency in this region of @xmath15 , log@xmath16 space for h and he atoms to separate during their flow .",
    "this chemical fractionation is one of several complex feedback processes which determines the evolution of the wind . in our picture",
    "a relative preponderance of metal ions are directly accelerated by the magnetic polar wind along open field lines and leaves the star permanently . at the same time",
    "many helium atoms are decoupled early in the flow ( as is hydrogen in cooler stars ) and return back to the surface along roughly the lines of force that guided their upward flow . at the surface",
    "_ bp - like _ chemical anomalies ( he - richness , metal - deficiency ) establish local vertical abundance gradients over time unless they are destroyed , e.g. through mixing .",
    "wind particles guided along closed lines accumulate in the torus for a short time before they are lost at their edges .",
    "the length of time these particles spend in the torus is far shorter than the evolutionary lifetime of the star ( e.g. , groote & hunger @xcite , havnes & goertz @xcite , linsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so the torus s composition will mirror the abundances found at the star s magnetic poles .    . [ tab1 ]",
    "adopted atmospheric parameters .",
    "notes : ( 1 ) @xmath15 is given in k , @xmath4sin@xmath5 in kms@xmath14 , and the zeropoint of rotational phase ( north magnetic pole crossing ) as hjd + 2400000 .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath17 for hr6684 might be quite inaccurate . ( 3 ) sources are given as indices : [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the data in fig.[starewlines ] are well enough sampled to draw several conclusions concerning the geometry of the tori .",
    "first , the absorptions among different strong resonance lines peak at the same small ranges of phase .",
    "this fact suggests that these lines form over the same stellar longitude .",
    "however , for @xmath0cep and @xmath1orie the ultraviolet quasi - continuum curves are offset from the central absorption phases of the strong resonance lines .",
    "this fact implies a _ warping _ at large distances from the star ( see also groote & hunger @xcite , gh97 ) .",
    "another conclusion from the sharpness of the maxima in these figures is that the heights of the clouds ( perpendicular to their plane of symmetry ) are at least one stellar diameter .",
    "otherwise , for short heights , their optically thick absorptions would be proportional to their projected areas against the stellar disk .",
    "such a geometry would impose an ( unobserved ) local minimum on the resonance - line absorption curve at the phase of mid - occultation .",
    "we used this fact to adopt an area coverage factor of 100% in our _ circus _ analysis of cloud parameters .      to investigate the behavior of the blue - wing absorption from winds in these stars , we modified our equivalent width extraction routine to compute flux ratios in a 2 segment of this wing to all valid fluxes in the order _ except those from the photospheric line profile_. with the contribution of the latter suppressed , we found no variation ( i.e. , to @xmath1810% ) in the wings of either the siiv or civ lines with rotation phase among any of the program stars . additionally , the blue edge velocities are stable over the cycle and are also remarkably uniform from star to star .",
    "gh97 had already found that the _ coronal _ wind in @xmath1orie is phase - independent , and the constancy we find tends to extend this conclusion to our other stars .",
    "this is a notable point because previous investigators have stated that the wind fluxes of hd184927 vary from this star s magnetic pole to equator ( vauclair et al .",
    "this erroneous perception has been an important supporting tenet for the model of _ photospheric _ diffusive settling of helium ( michaud et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", these observations suggest that the initial wind column , dubbed the _ jet _ by sb90 , is not visible in these data , though indeed it must ultimately be visible at some level of photometric precision because of the optical thinness in the far blue wings of the photospheric lines .",
    "the difficulty of observing the jets could mean that their velocities are spread out over a large range .",
    "fig.[staremabs ] depicts the total ranges in absorption and emission from pairs of observations for the strong resonance lines for the program stars .",
    "inspection of these figures shows that profiles at clear - star ( dashed lines ) phases differ from occultation phase profiles ( solid lines ) in the following ways : ( 1 ) the clear - star profiles of civ and siiv exhibit emissions in their cores and red wings ( @xmath9[resemis ] ) , ( 2 ) the siiii profiles exhibit narrower cores , and ( 3 ) the red and blue far - wings of these lines are strong relative to photospheric line models .    as with the weaker metallic lines , one would hope to utilize the strengths of strong resonance lines at clear - star phases as baselines to compare with the absorptions at occultation phases .",
    "however , modeling the strong resonance lines is a problem complicated by the presence of noncoherent scattering ( partial redistribution ) in the line source function as well as illumination of the torus by a diffuse radiation source ( the jet ) . in general",
    ", it is difficult to separate the effects of the torus from both the photosphere and a jet . in particular",
    ", it is impossible in practice to identify a reference photospheric profile from which to difference absorption and emission of the torus - cloud because the observed siiv , civ , and nv line profiles are peculiar at all phases , exhibiting strong absorptions during occultations and emissions at other times .",
    "nonetheless , points 2 and 3 above can provide hints of local cloud conditions .",
    "for example , point # 2 suggests that the broad core of the occultation - phase profiles is a signature of velocity broadening . as to point",
    "# 3 , the extended , particularly red wings of the siiii and siiv lines can best be understood as enhanced strengthenings from a dense cloud .",
    "consider that our _ circus _",
    "models for siiii @xmath191206 and the siiv resonance doublet indicate that densities less than 10@xmath20 @xmath8 can not be distinguished from the clear - star ( photospheric ) profiles .",
    "our best models require cloud densities in the range of 10@xmath21 @xmath8 .",
    "taking again the simplest paradigm that the cloud temperature increases inward toward the star , the wings of the strong silicon resonance lines suggest then that cloud densities increase inwards too .",
    "traces of the variations so readily apparent in the siiv , civ , and nv lines are still present in siiii @xmath191206 and even in the aliii doublet .",
    "however , the difference between this line and the others is that the siiii line does not show any emission at any phase . while this circumstance might lead to the hope that one can model the @xmath191206 variations , we found in practice that we could not reproduce the observed strengthening of this line without introducing a substantial microturbulence .",
    "as an example , consider the siiii line in @xmath0cep .",
    "table[tab2 ] shows a cloud - added absorption of 343 m .",
    "_ circus _ models suggest a maximum absorption for t@xmath22 = 1700019000k ( @xmath9[siabs ] ) . even for column densities of 310@xmath610@xmath23 @xmath24 and a turbulence of 20 kms@xmath14",
    ", our simulations predict an absorption in the range 138259 m .",
    "low - temperature , pure - absorption ( _ non - lte _ ) models also can not reproduce the observed strengthening .",
    "if one introduces a high turbulence of 50 kms@xmath14 _ and also _ adopts a reasonable temperature and column density ( 17000k and 3@xmath610@xmath23 @xmath24 ) , the observed absorptions ( @xmath25340 m ) , can then be reproduced . the siiii line s sensitivity to",
    "turbulence implied here is a consequence of the saturation in the core .",
    "one may assume that the broad cores of the civ and siiv lines at occultation phases are also due to turbulence .",
    "as for siiii @xmath191206 , moderately high turbulences and moderate temperatures produce good fits to the aliii doublet absorptions , noted in table[tab3 ] .",
    "we also note similar good fits for hd184927 .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the similar ionization potential of this ion : the aliii lines are probably formed in nearly the same region of the cloud as siiii @xmath191206 .",
    "the anomalously strong absorptions of the nv 1238 , 1242doublet at occultation phases first drew our attention to the rotating magnetic b stars . according to stellar atlases ( e.g. walborn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the spectra of _ normal _",
    "b0b2 v stars show no trace of this doublet .",
    "even for the hot star 10lac ( o9 ; @xmath15 = 35400k ) , we estimate that this line has a photospheric strength of only 175 m   ( see the brandt et al .",
    "@xcite atlas ) .",
    "our _ synspec _ models reveal that their presence is difficult to discern in photospheric spectra in stars with @xmath15 s below about 28000k because of nearby line blends .",
    "grigsby & morrison ( @xcite ) have recently noted the anomalous strengths of nv lines in spectra of the so - called _ nitrogen enhanced _ late - o stars ( walborn et al .",
    "@xcite ) . they attribute them to a photoionization of the wind by x - rays .",
    "however , the wind explanation can not apply to the rotating magnetic stars in our sample because the lines do not show extended , high - velocity ( blue ) wings .",
    "moreover , the nv strengths in our program stars tend to be larger than the features in these o - stars . by elimination ,",
    "we conclude that the nv absorptions are formed in the circumstellar cloud(s ) .",
    "the nv absorptions in these stars are so large ( @xmath25750 m and @xmath25530 m over the _ full _",
    "profile for @xmath0cep and hd184927 , respectively ) that they can not be caused by enhanced abundances or strong winds , or fit by our conventional strategies .",
    "for example , our _ standard _ cloud models , with both high cloud temperatures ( @xmath1133000k ) _ and _ a very large high column density ( 10@xmath26 @xmath24 ) can not reproduce them .",
    "it is only when one considers models with both high cloud temperatures and microturbulences together that the strong absorptions can be matched . for such combinations",
    "the precise strength of the absorption is insensitive to column length because the line is already so opaque . to assess the effects of increasing both these parameters , we carefully computed the underlying photospheric spectrum , taking into account the star s @xmath15 , log@xmath16 , and @xmath4sin@xmath5 .",
    "the _ circus _ models showed that the nv line is extremely sensitive to temperature , a fact that greatly restricts the range of variables in successful models .",
    "for @xmath0cep we settled on a promising pair of models ( normal abundances , column density of 10@xmath23 @xmath24 , microturbulence = 50 kms@xmath14 ) .",
    "then , a change from 28000k to 29000k strengthens the equivalent width from 585 to 742 m .",
    "increasing the microturbulence from 50 to 100 kms@xmath14 produces exactly the same increase .",
    "thus , both microturbulence and temperature are sensitively constrained by the strengthening of this line .",
    "we obtained similar temperatures for @xmath1orie and hr6684 , with a turbulence of 50 kms@xmath14 .",
    "for hd184927 we were able to match the absorption with a temperature of 3000031000k , assuming a column density of 12@xmath610@xmath23 @xmath24 and 50 kms@xmath14 .",
    "the best fit models are summarized in table[tab4 ] .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] exhibits a model fit of the nv doublet for @xmath0cep at the occultation phase .",
    "the fitted cloud absorption profile was computed with a _ circus _",
    "model having a coverage factor of 100% , heated t@xmath22 = 29000k , a column density of 3.2@xmath610@xmath23 @xmath24 , a microturbulence of 50 kms@xmath14 , and a further convolution with a 100 kms@xmath14 gaussian .",
    "this macroturbulence - smearing was necessary to remove the corners of a boxy - shape profile produced by microturbulence alone .",
    "the parameters required to approximate the nv absorption of hd184927 are similar . because hd184927 has a low surface metallicity ,",
    "the required cloud temperature is a little higher , @xmath2531000k , and the derived micro- and macro - turbulences are then 50 kms@xmath14 and 100 kms@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the spectroscopic hallmark of the rotating magnetic b stars is the strong variation of their civ and nv doublet lines with rotational phase , ranging from strong absorption to redshifted emission .",
    "since these variations are not necessarily well ordered , only a few generalizations can be made about their behavior .",
    "one overriding general characteristic is that the emission and/or absorption components are always present to some degree .",
    "a second characteristic is that although small differences can arise in same - phase profiles of different epochs , the general variations are remarkably repeatable over at least several years .",
    "for example , a narrow redshifted emission feature seems to be a common feature in the 1238 profiles of hd184927 at phases near 0.85 and 0.15 , i.e. at the beginning and end of the range of clear - star phases .",
    "for some stars , such as hr6684 , the nv profiles almost always show emission components , even when much of the profile is strongly in absorption . for other stars like @xmath1orie ,",
    "the nv emissions are difficult to detect at all .",
    "the weakness of nv emissions in @xmath1orie , along with the weakness of siiv emissions for all of the program stars , probably explains why these emissions have gone unreported for so long in studies of he - strong stars .",
    "all four of our stars show detectable emissions in lines of at least two ions . in two of our four program stars ,",
    "the nv lines exhibit the strongest emissions , while for hr6684 or @xmath1orie it is the civ emissions which are the strongest .    in some cases ,",
    "the nv emissions of these stars are almost completely confined to the red side of the profile , and indeed in all cases the tvs is larger there .",
    "the lower portions of figs.[staremabs ] b , c , d and [ fig6 ] , depict the tvs spectrum divided by the mean profile for the civ profiles or nv profiles .",
    "we depict the ratio of the tvs to the mean spectrum in order to account for absorptions of the strong line core which would otherwise suppress fluctuations at low velocities .",
    "the tvs - ratio profiles generally peak at + 60125 kms@xmath14 , and their red wings extend to + 300400 kms@xmath14 in each star with remarkable uniformity .",
    "thus , the edge velocities are not related to the peak emission strength , the star s metallicity , pulsational status , or @xmath27 .",
    "a comparison of the tvs - ratio spectrum for @xmath0cep among both large- and small - aperture observations in fig.[fig6 ] gives a qualitative idea of the robustness and constancy of the activity spectrum over even widely separated epochs for this star .",
    "it is interesting that the tvs profiles for civ and nv do not exhibit a tail extending to the far blue wing .",
    "this fact shows that the stars winds do not vary much over stellar longitude . in all",
    ", one finds that the redshifted emissions are uncorrelated with wind visibility in the blue wings of the lines .",
    "likewise , the emissions do not appear to arise from the wind , so one must look to a different mechanism to explain them too .",
    "we can quantify the temperature range required to reproduce the nv emissions by again using _ circus _ models , again taking @xmath0cep as an example .",
    "as one increases the cloud plasma temperature in these models , the nv lines first show increased absorptions at temperatures .",
    "these absorptions peak in the range @xmath113500040000k , both for lte and non - lte models .",
    "as the temperature increases the line goes into emission .",
    "one may place interesting upper limits on the line formation region of the nv emissions because at temperatures in excess of 40000k these regions of the cloud would contribute an unacceptably large fraction to the combined continuum flux of the star and cloud .",
    "such models would produce a nearly sinuosoidal modulation in continuous flux as the torus co - rotates around the star .",
    "this is not indicated by our continuum light curve data .",
    "so we can conclude that any continuum flux from a bright emission patch near the poles is negligible .",
    "an additional consequence of these arguments is that the nv line emissions are optically thin .",
    "this result is also supported by the high ratio ( 1.52 ) of the relative r.m.s .",
    "amplitudes of the two lines in fig.[fig6 ] ( the doublet components have a gf ratio of 2 ) .    in assuming the optical thinness condition and an areal coverage factor of unity , it becomes straightforward to model the @xmath191238 emission equivalent width . again taking @xmath0cep as an example , the observed emission over the full profile is @xmath25 -220 m . in the models there is only a small trade - off between gas temperature and column density , e.g. , a choice of parameters 49000k and 3@xmath610@xmath28 @xmath24 or 50000k and 10@xmath29 @xmath24 ; the limiting condition for @xmath30 = 1 . because of the sensitivity of nv ionization with temperature , the results for hd184927 ( full profile equivalent width @xmath11 -0.055 ) are similar to those for @xmath0cep : we find an optimal temperature of 45000k for the resulting length of the nv emission region is 1@xmath610@xmath20 @xmath8 , the nv - emitting region comes out to be prohibitively thin , only @xmath11100 km .",
    "this is roughly 100@xmath6 smaller than a scale height in the torus .",
    "the shock depth can be reconciled to the expected range of values if the assumed coverage factor for nv emission is @xmath311% rather than the initially assumed value of 100% .",
    "a key result of the previous section is that the uv line absorptions of a rotating magnetic b star vary because of a cloud passing in front of the star .",
    "thus , there is no need to invoke ( nor evidence for ) an inhomogeneous metallic composition on the surfaces of these stars .",
    "the observations also suggest that the mass in these clouds is nearly constant over time . to maintain a constant mass",
    ", the wind accreted by the cloud must somehow settle back to the star and/or escape through its outer point .",
    "indeed , perhaps it is the settling of cloud material onto the surface that is responsible for the high densities we found in the _ inner cloud regions_. as a consequence of this recirculation , the cloud has virtually the same metallic composition as the star s polar caps and indeed the rest of its surface .",
    "the numerical analysis of line strength variations in @xmath9[analy ] indicates that the cloud line components form in an extended environment of a column density of roughly 1@xmath610@xmath26 @xmath24 . in the detailed models of the cloud spectra of hd184927 and @xmath0cep ,",
    "the lines are formed over a range of temperatures consistent with the stellar photosphere s radiation field .",
    "although there is no evidence for long - term changes in cloud conditions , there is a strong suggestion of small- and large - scale turbulence in the inner regions .",
    "the strong wings of the siiv and siiii resonance lines argue for increasing cloud densities in these regions , which seem to approach photospheric values at the inner edge of the torus .",
    "the redshifted emissions in the nv and civ lines observed during the magnetic pole - on phases demonstrate that downflows occur in the vicinity of the rotating , magnetic b - stars . in our picture",
    "they are most likely to arise from shocks because of the rapid deceleration of the wind particles as they impact the pre - existing torus ( cf . babel & montmerle @xcite ) .",
    "this produces a redshift during the phase when the magnetic pole is visible because the wind has followed the curved lines of force and is then moving away from the observer .",
    "however , additional possibilities are possible .",
    "one should also consider the possibility of a stalled wind which impacts the star s surface near its point of origin .",
    "( in principle , it is also possible that magnetohydrodynamical processes , or kelvin - helmholtz instabilities ; see shore et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , operate , but we see no need for this in view of of the potential of steady - state hydrodynamical iteractions alone . ) in examining the evidence , we have found two emission characteristics that cast doubt on whether the emissions are produced by reaccretion , and we review them in the following .",
    "we discovered the first of these characteristics by recalling that sb90 had drawn attention to _ red - shaded _",
    "civ emissions in two he - strong stars for which periods are not known , hd96446 and hd58260 .",
    "sb90 also noted that these features can not arise from spherically symmetric shells , i.e. they are not true p - cygni profiles .",
    "the sb90 star hd96446 is likely to meet our criteria for membership among the rotating magnetic b stars because it also shows nv line emission .",
    "in addition , its emissions are variable .",
    "the case of hd58260 is particularly interesting in this analysis for two reasons .",
    "first , sb90 have pointed out that we probably observe this star at a pole - on aspect ( the magnetic and rotational poles are nearly coincident ) , so its emissions do not vary .",
    "second , this star s civ line emissions are both optically thick and strong  indeed , it attains a level of 0.5i@xmath32 . in attempting to model civ emissions , we found that it was not possible to reproduce this emission strength within the context of our models .",
    "even our _ best _ model parameters ( t@xmath22 = 30000k , turbulence = 50100 kms@xmath14 , high column densities , coverage factor = 1 ) produce civ emissions of only 0.20 i@xmath32 .",
    "we also found that the efficiency for producing the emission peaks very sharply at 30000k , so areal coverage factors of at least 34@xmath6 are probably necessary .",
    "_ since this factor is significantly greater than one , the emissions can not be produced just on the stellar surface . _",
    "the area of the cloud - torus is more than adequate to produce the total emission , so we are led to the conclusion that the emissions are caused at the wind - cloud interface .",
    "the second characteristic we used to decide between the competing shock models for line emission came from the detailed examination of the evolution of the civ and nv emissions in both @xmath0cep and @xmath1orie .",
    "we discovered that an emission component appears first at the end of the occultation phase . in a model",
    "in which the downflows fall onto the star s surface , we would expect the line - emitting material to share the star s rotation because of its co - rotation with the star . as the cloud clears the receding limb of the star at the end of its occultation , emission is produced as the failed - wind stream shocks at a magnetic pole ( now appearing at the opposite limb of the star ) .",
    "the emissions from this region will have an algebraically smaller radial velocity both because of the star s rotation and because the projected component of the infall velocity at this time is nearly zero .",
    "the emissions should then migrate redward smoothly across the line profile in this model as both velocities become more positive .",
    "the actual observations indicate that the emission component first appears weakly at a common point in the line profiles of both stars ( @xmath11 - 200 kms@xmath14 ) and then migrates to the red .",
    "this smooth behavior is suddenly interrupted by the strong appearance of a red emission component at + 0100 kms@xmath14 .",
    "this particular evolution is difficult to understand as a consequence of shocks occurring on the stellar surface , particularly for @xmath0cep and @xmath1orie , which have very different rotational velocities .",
    "in contrast , the disk interpretation is almost _ too easy _ , suffering only from an embarrassment of several nonunique geometrical interpretations .",
    "a related question is how the nv absorptions are formed during occultation phases , sometimes even coexisting with the emissions .",
    "the hypothesis that the nv emissions are emitted from the torus interface provides an advantage of restricting the formation of the emission to the same general site as the absorption .",
    "both sites require a high temperature .",
    "unlike the emission component , the absorption is optically thick . _",
    "circus _ models show that absorption of nv is necessarily formed in a turbulent medium having a warm temperature of about 30000k .",
    "these results suggest that the nv absorption is formed in a large region of the cloud in which civ and nv are overionized .",
    "we suggest that the wind - cloud shocks generate this overionization .",
    "still , it is not clear whether the heating required to produce the nv absorption occurs from a conversion of mechanical or radiative energy .",
    "the problem with either mechanism is that it is difficult to heat a large enough cloud volume to produce the amount of absorption observed .",
    "for example , turbulence can circulate shock - heated gas but probably only to a few scale heights . for representative cloud parameters ( 30000k , 10@xmath20 @xmath8 )",
    "this length is probably only 10@xmath33 km or less .",
    "radiative models encounter similar difficulties if the radiation from the shocks is emitted primarily in the euv .",
    "the photoionization radius for n@xmath34 in our cloud models is only @xmath1110@xmath35 km . in contrast , _ circus _ models that match the nv absorptions require a full areal coverage factor , so the scale length for energy dissipation must be at least 1r@xmath36 . the radiative model can be saved if the shocks generate soft x - rays ( 1/21 kev ) which would be transparent to the cloud over its full length .",
    "such irradiation would produce a broad distribution of ion states ( cohen et al .",
    "@xcite ) and would thus account for the observed strong absorptions produced by the cloud over a range of ion stages .",
    "the evidence for x - ray heating on these stars is ambiguous .",
    "although the mean x - ray levels are known to be low , little is known yet about variability . the kinetic model in turn",
    "might be reconciled with models of relativistic particles penetrating to great depths into the torus of @xmath1orie .",
    "alternatively , it may be that porosity , rarefied zones , and/or alfvn waves play roles in transporting mechanical energy into the cloud .",
    "although we favor the radiative model , all of these possibilities are speculative .",
    "thus , the question of the origin of the nv absorptions remains open .",
    "the present work confirms the finding by henrichs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that a separate class of rotating magnetic stars exists among the early - type main sequence b stars . taking @xmath0cep as a case in point , one finds that a dipolar field of only a few hundred gauss can suffice to guide a polar wind from the surface to its equatorial regions via closed magnetic loops .",
    "the wind particles are abruptly halted near the magnetic equator where they establish a quasi - static , torus - shape structure ( sb90 ) .",
    "our picture differs from the picture of gh97 and other investigators in two important respects .",
    "first , we have found that variations of the uv and probably optical lines ( other than of helium ) are due to absorptions in the torus - cloud .",
    "second , we have remarked that the blue wings of the siiii , siiv , and civ resonance lines remain remarkably constant with rotational phase for all the program stars .",
    "let us examine a few ramifications of these results .",
    "if indeed the variable line absorptions are caused by the clouds , and if the metallic composition is nearly constant across their surfaces , their low - metallicities all over the surface will be maintained only if cloud material settles back to the star more efficiently than its wind streams upward .",
    "one may speculate as to how this might happen . in our model",
    ", the result of this settling is that the inner torus has a high density and thus controls the configuration of the local field lines , rather than the other way round .",
    "for example , the weight of the particles over the equator may cause the field lines to sag , as in some dense solar quiescent prominences , and particles could return directly to the surface .",
    "turbulence may also help recirculate cloud particles to the star .",
    "the phase - independent nature of the wind is more difficult to understand .",
    "gh97 pointed to the two types of wind , one originating from the surface ( magnetic pole ) , the second , an exo - magnetospheric wind originating at the outer edge of the torus .",
    "if the absorption contributions of the two wind components were equal in the blue wings , one would expect the fluxes of their blue wings to vary sinusoidally twice per cycle  yet this is not observed . however , even if the wind mass fluxes were comparable , it is likely that their observable contributions in the blue wings of the line profiles could still be _ unequal _ for a few reasons .",
    "for example , the exo - magnetospheric wind will be more likely to remain visible over a wide range of phases , both as a consequence of its inverse - square density dependence with distance and because its streamlines will arc _ backwards _ to maintain angular momentum conservation .",
    "these curved trajectories will cross our lines of sight over a variety of rotational phases as they go off to infinity , diluting any modulation of wind absorption at any particular phase .",
    "the key requirement of all such arguments is that the wind remains visible over long path lengths .    as outlined in @xmath9[sketch ] , a necessary requisite of our picture of rotating magnetic b stars is that closed field loops divert the wind flow from the magnetic poles to the torus at the magnetic equator . in this picture stalled",
    "wind particles return to the magnetic caps and establish a large composition gradient .",
    "this does not occur in nonmagnetic stars because envelope mixing destroys composition gradients before they can be established .",
    "also , similar processes may take place in hot bp analogs ( e.g. , @xmath37@xmath38oric ) , but its wind is so strong that chemical separation can not be expected to take place .",
    "the results of this paper suggest indirectly that composition gradients are destroyed in magnetic , pulsating stars , such as in @xmath0cep and hr6684 . yet",
    ", there are fundamental puzzles in even this simple picture .",
    "for example , what is to be concluded about hr6684 , which has low - metal but normal - he abundances ?",
    "perhaps the metals leave this star in the wind while both hydrogen and helium atoms are reaccreted .",
    "such circumstances are envisioned by hunger & groote ( @xcite ) , but only in late - type b stars .",
    "a second puzzle is the be - like episodes exhibited by @xmath0cep perhaps every 30 years ( kaper & mathias @xcite , panko & tarasov @xcite ) . the tight scatter in the resonance line absorptions in fig.[starewlines]a and in fig.5 of henrichs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggests that the presence or absence of a flattened be disk does not affect torus - cloud signatures noticeably .",
    "thus , if these ejections are related to the be - phenomenon , the uv phenomenology of the two types of circumstellar structures is vastly different ( in addition to their physical morphologies ) .",
    "in @xmath91 and @xmath95 we listed 13 probable members of the rotating magnetic b - star group ( including @xmath37@xmath39oric ) . rotating magnetic b stars",
    "appear also to include an indeterminate number of early - b main sequence stars with conditions that promote envelope mixing ( pulsation , rapid rotation ) .",
    "one such example may be the unusual star hd144941 ( see also gh97 ) .",
    "this star lies within the region of the h - r diagram populated by the he - strong stars and shows extreme he - richness and metal deficiencies . its high galactic latitude , and high radial velocity ( -52.6 kms@xmath14 ) led harrison & jeffery ( @xcite , @xcite ) and others to consider it as a member of the hydrogen - deficient b star class .",
    "moreover , harrison & jeffery ( @xcite ) found that the fe abundance is just as deficient as the cno elements and suggested that these abundances are primordial . to test this result , we inspected two high - dispersion _ iue _ spectra obtained for this star reveal redshifted emissions in both the civ and siiv lines as well as a strong wind .",
    "these spectra show anomalously strong nv absorption so perhaps hd144941 is a member too .",
    "we must also remark that the search for magnetic and rotational periods is very labor and telescope intensive , so new members of this class might be found in the long run by examining spectra of early - b stars for the presence of anomalous nv absorptions and/or siiv , civ , nv emissions .    the physical attributes of the tori around the rotating magnetic stars can also be used to clarify our understanding of _ classical _ stars .",
    "several studies ( see balona @xcite ) have suggested that co - rotating clouds are responsible for periodic spectroscopic and/or photometric varations in these stars .",
    "the difficulty in distinguishing between this explanation and nonradial pulsation is that optically thick clouds can mimic cool regions on the atmosphere .",
    "we are optimistic that some of the results in this paper that indicate the presence of redshifted components in resonance lines , the selective variation of low - excitation lines , and high turbulence together can help to discriminate between models responsible for the variability of these stars .",
    "a general understanding of physical conditions leading to co - rotating magnetospheres will be aided by future studies of the magnetic rotating b variables ( with the probable extension to the sn he - weak stars ( see shore et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , hot he - strong analogues like @xmath37@xmath38oric , ap stars like iqaur ( babel & montmerle @xcite ) , magnetic herbig ae - be stars , and late - type active stars such as abdor .",
    "the results of this paper point to a number of desiderata which will clarify the nature of the class of rotating magnetic b stars in particular and also contribute to its global understanding .",
    "we close by listing a few of them :    * the _ iue _ archive can be conveniently investigated to search for additional examples of early - b type stars with anomalous nv absorptions and redshifted emissions among its civ and nv resonance lines , * far - uv _ snapshot _ observations can be undertaken to determine whether the anomalous absorptions and redshifted emissions extend to the ovi doublet , * the x - ray fluxes from these stars can be monitored around their rotational cycles to shed some light on the production mechanism of the civ , nv absorptions , * optical observations of the high balmer lines can be carried out over rotational phase among all the candidate members of this class with a view of establishing whether cloud density varies with time and as a function of relevant stellar parameters , * spectral imaging can profitably be carried out in the h@xmath2 line and ultimately in the strong ultraviolet resonance lines from space - borne interferometers .    _",
