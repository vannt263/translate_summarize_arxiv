    ". an important generalization of interactive proof systems  @xcite , they were originally introduced in  @xcite in a cryptographic context .",
    "later it was shown  @xcite that the class @xmath0 of languages having a multi - prover interactive proof system is equal to @xmath1 , which led to the development of the theory of inapproximability and probabilistically checkable proofs  @xcite .    in a multi - prover interactive proof system ,",
    "a verifier communicates with several provers , which do not communicate with each other .",
    "one of the central challenges in this area is to understand the power of _ quantum _ multi - prover interactive proof systems ( qmip systems ) . in particular ,",
    "the major open question is how _ entanglement _ shared among the provers affects these systems .",
    "this question is unique to the quantum world , since the related classical resource of shared randomness is known not to affect the power of such systems .",
    "it is not even clear whether entanglement _ increases _ or _ decreases _ the verification power of qmip systems .",
    "on one hand , using entanglement , dishonest provers might cheat more easily , thereby breaking the soundness of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the increased power that entanglement gives to honest provers could be harnessed by the verifier , increasing the expressivity of the proof system .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all previous results in this area ( see below ) have focused on the former case , studying the _ negative _ effects of entanglement , i.e. , whether or not _ dishonest _",
    "entangled provers can break proof systems that are sound for any dishonest _",
    "unentangled _ provers .",
    "our work is the first to focus on the _ positive _ aspects of entanglement , where shared entanglement may be advantageous to _ honest _ provers .",
    "kobayashi  and  matsumoto  @xcite introduced qmip systems with a quantum verifier , and proved that the class of languages having a quantum multi - prover interactive proof system is equal to @xmath1 when the provers do not share any prior entanglement , and is contained in @xmath1 when they share at most polynomially many entangled qubits .",
    "cleve ,  hyer ,  toner ,  and  watrous  @xcite studied multi - prover interactive proof systems in which the verifier remains classical but provers may initially share entanglement , and presented several protocols for which shared epr pairs can increase the power of dishonest provers .",
    "they also proved that the class of languages having some restricted version of multi - prover interactive proof system , denoted by @xmath2 , is contained in @xmath3 when provers are allowed to share prior entanglement ( wehner  @xcite improved the upper bound to @xmath4 , the class of languages having a two - message quantum interactive proof system ) , which is in stark contrast to the corresponding class @xmath5 without prior entanglement , which is equal to @xmath1 . very recently , kempe ,  kobayashi ,  matsumoto ,  toner ,  and  vidick  @xcite gave limits on the cheating power of dishonest entangled provers in some quantum and classical multi - prover interactive proof systems , by showing how such proof systems can be  immunized \" against the use of entanglement by dishonest provers .",
    "ito ,  kobayashi ,  preda ,  sun ,  and  yao  @xcite and cleve ,  gavinsky ,  and  jain  @xcite also gave limits on the cheating power of entangled provers for some classical multi - prover interactive proof systems .",
    "all these studies focus only on the _ negative _ aspects of prior entanglement , i.e. , whether or not _",
    "dishonest _ but prior - entangled provers can break the soundness of the proof system .",
    "this paper studies the _ positive _ aspects of prior entanglement and shows a number of general properties of qmip systems , extensively using prior entanglement for _ honest _ provers .",
    "this gives the first evidence that prior entanglement _ is _ useful even for honest provers .",
    "our main theorem states that any quantum @xmath6-prover interactive proof system that may involve polynomially many rounds can be parallelized to a _ one - round _ quantum @xmath7-prover interactive proof system of _ perfect _ completeness and such that the gap between completeness and soundness accepting probabilities is still bounded by an inverse - polynomial . to state our results more precisely ,",
    "let @xmath8 denote the class of languages having an @xmath9-turn quantum @xmath6-prover interactive proof system with completeness at least @xmath10 and soundness at most @xmath11 , where provers are allowed to share an arbitrary amount of entanglement .",
    "we call the difference @xmath12 the  gap \" in this paper . as commonly used in classical multi - prover interactive proofs we use the term `` round '' to describe an interaction consisting of questions from the verifier followed by answers from the provers .",
    "we use the term  turn \" for messages sent in one direction .",
    "one round consists of two turns : a turn for the verifier and a turn for the provers .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be the sets of all polynomially bounded functions and all inverse - polynomial functions , respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the number @xmath9 of turns and the number @xmath6 of provers are functions in @xmath13 with respect to the input size , and that completeness @xmath10 and soundness @xmath11 are functions of the input size @xmath15}}$ ] .",
    "then we show the following main theorem .    for any @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "satisfying @xmath18 there exists a function @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "[ theorem : parallelization to 1 round ]    since it is easy to amplify the success probability without increasing the number of rounds by running multiple instances of a proof system in parallel using a different set of provers for every instance , the above theorem shows that one - round ( i.e. , two - turn ) qmip systems are as powerful as general qmip systems .    for any @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "satisfying @xmath18 , and @xmath21 , there exists @xmath22 such that @xmath23.[corollary : 1 round qmip = general qmip ]    the proof of our main theorem comes in three parts , corresponding to sections [ section : qmip with perfect completeness equals general qmip ] , [ subsection : parallelizing to three turns ] , and [ section : part3 ] .",
    "the first part shows how to convert any qmip system with two - sided bounded error into one with one - sided bounded error of perfect completeness without changing the number of provers .",
    "the second part shows that any qmip system with polynomially many turns can be parallelized to one with only three turns ( messages from the provers followed by questions from the verifier followed by responses from the provers ) in which the gap between completeness and soundness is still bounded by an inverse - polynomial . again",
    "the number of provers remains the same in this transformation .",
    "finally , the third part shows that any three - turn qmip system with sufficiently large gap can be converted into a two - turn ( i.e. , one - round ) qmip system with inverse - polynomial gap , by adding an extra prover .",
    "similar statements to our first and second parts have already been shown by kitaev and watrous  @xcite for _ single - prover _ quantum interactive proofs . their proofs , however , heavily rely on the fact that a single quantum prover can apply arbitrary operators over all the space except for the private space of the verifier .",
    "this is not the case any more for quantum multi - prover interactive proofs , since now a quantum prover can not access the qubits in the private spaces of the other quantum provers , in addition to those in the private space of the verifier .",
    "hence new methods are required for the multi - prover case .    to transform proof systems so that they have perfect completeness",
    ", our basic idea is to use the quantum rewinding technique developed for quantum zero - knowledge proofs by watrous  @xcite , but in a different way . in our case we use it to `` rewind '' an unsuccessful computation that would result in rejection into a successful one .",
    "to apply the quantum rewinding technique , we first modify the proof system so that the honest provers can convince the verifier with probability exactly @xmath24 using some initial shared state and moreover no other initial shared state achieves a higher acceptance probability .",
    "this initial shared state corresponds to the auxiliary input in the case of quantum zero - knowledge proofs , and thus , as in that scenario , the sequence of forward , backward , and forward executions of the protocol achieves perfect completeness .",
    "the obvious problem of this construction lies in proving soundness , as the dishonest provers may not use the same strategies for all of the three executions of the proof system . to settle this",
    ", we design a simple protocol that tests if the second backward execution is indeed a backward simulation of the first forward execution .",
    "the verifier performs with equal probability either the original rewinding protocol or this invertibility test without revealing which test the provers are undergoing .",
    "this forces the provers to use essentially the same strategies for the first two executions of the protocol , which is sufficient to bound the soundness . as a result",
    "we prove the following .    for any @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "satisfying @xmath18 , and @xmath21 , there exists @xmath25 such that @xmath26.[theorem : qmip with perfect completeness ]    for the parallelization to three turns , our approach is to first show that any qmip system with sufficiently large gap can be converted into another qmip system with the same number of provers , in which the number of rounds ( turns ) becomes almost half of that in the original proof system .",
    "the proof idea is that the verifier in the first turn receives the snapshot state from the original system after ( almost ) half of turns have been executed , and then with equal probability executes either a forward - simulation or a backward - simulation of the original system from that turn on .",
    "honest provers only have to simulate the original system to convince the verifier , while any strategy of dishonest provers with unallowable high success probability would lead to a strategy of dishonest provers in the original system that contradicts the soundness condition . by repeatedly applying this modification , together with theorem [ theorem : qmip with perfect completeness ] as preprocessing",
    ", we can convert any qmip system into a three - turn qmip system with the same number of provers that still has an inverse polynomial gap .    for any @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "satisfying @xmath18 , there exists @xmath27 such that @xmath28 . [",
    "theorem : parallelization to 3 turns ]    for @xmath29 , this gives an alternative proof of the parallelization theorem due to kitaev  and  watrous  @xcite for single - prover quantum interactive proofs .",
    "it is interesting to note that our parallelization method does not need the controlled - swap test at all , while it _ is _ the key test in the kitaev - watrous parallelization method .",
    "another point worth mentioning in our method is that , at every time step of our parallelized protocol , the whole system has only one snapshot state of the original system .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact that the whole system has to simultaneously treat many snapshot states in the kitaev - watrous method .",
    "the merit of our method is , thus , that we do not need to treat the possible entanglement among different snapshot states when analyzing soundness , which may be a main reason why our method works well even for the multi - prover case .",
    "moreover , our method is more space - efficient than the kitaev - watrous method , in particular when we parallelize a system with polynomially many rounds .    to prove the third part",
    ", we will take a detour by proving that    * any three - turn qmip system with sufficiently large gap can be modified to a three - turn _ public - coin _ qmip system with the same number of provers and a gap of roughly similar order of magnitude , * any three - turn public - coin qmip system can be converted into a two - turn qmip system without changing completeness and soundness , by adding one extra prover .",
    "the notion of public - coin qmip systems we use is a natural generalization of public - coin quantum interactive proofs in the single - prover case introduced by marriott  and  watrous  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding complexity class is denoted by @xmath30 in this paper .",
    "intuitively , at every round , a public - coin quantum verifier flips a fair classical coin at most polynomially many times , and then simply broadcasts the result of these coin - flips to all the provers . property ( i )",
    "is a generalization of the result by marriott  and  watrous  @xcite to the multi - prover case , whereas property ( ii ) is completely new .",
    "the idea to prove ( ii ) , assuming that the number of provers in the original proof system is @xmath6 , is to send questions only to the first @xmath6 provers in the new @xmath31-prover system , requesting the original second messages from the @xmath6 provers in the original system .",
    "the verifier expects to receive from the @xmath7-st prover the original first messages from the @xmath6 provers in the original system without asking any question to that prover .",
    "the public - coin property of the original system implies the nonadaptiveness of the messages from the verifier , which is essential to prove ( ii ) . in fact",
    ", there is a way to directly prove the third part , but our detour enables us to show another two important properties of qmip systems . specifically , property ( i ) essentially proves the equivalence of _ public - coin _ quantum @xmath6-prover interactive proofs and general quantum @xmath6-prover interactive proofs , for any @xmath6 .    for any @xmath32 and @xmath17",
    "satisfying @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , there exists @xmath33 such that @xmath34 . [",
    "theorem : public - coin qmip = general qmip ]    note that in the classical case , public - coin multi - prover interactive proofs are only as powerful as single - prover interactive proofs : because every prover receives the same question from the verifier it means that every prover knows how other provers will behave and the joint strategy of the provers can therefore be simulated by a single prover .",
    "hence , these systems can not be as powerful as general classical multi - prover interactive proofs unless @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , our result shows that in the quantum case , public - coin qmip systems _ are _ as powerful as general qmip systems .",
    "the non - triviality of public - coin qmip systems may be explained as follows : even if every quantum prover knows how other quantum provers will behave , still each quantum prover can apply only local transformations over a part of some state that may be entangled among the provers , which is not enough to simulate every possible strategy a single quantum prover could follow .",
    "property ( ii ) for the case @xmath36 implies that any language in @xmath37 ( and thus in @xmath38 ) has a _ two - prover one - round _ quantum interactive proof system of perfect completeness with exponentially small error in soundness , since any language in @xmath37 has a three - message public - coin quantum interactive proof system of perfect completeness with exponentially small error in soundness  @xcite .    for any @xmath27 , @xmath39 ( and",

    "all these results are , however , not known to hold under the existence of prior entanglement among the provers . before our result , it has even been open if @xmath38 has a two - prover one - round quantum interactive proof system .",

    "@xcite is sound in a weak sense against any pair of dishonest prior - entangled provers : soundness is bounded away from one by an inverse - polynomial .",
    "their result is incomparable to ours since on one hand we have a much stronger soundness condition , and on the other both the verifier and the honest provers must be quantum .",
    "in contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite both of them just follow a classical protocol . )    finally , we stress again that our constructions extensively use the prior shared entanglement of the provers in a positive sense . in particular , even if the honest provers in the original proof system do not need any prior entanglement at all , the honest provers in the constructed proof system do need prior entanglement in many cases .",
    "most of the properties proved in this paper ( theorems  [ theorem : parallelization to 1 round ] and [ theorem : public - coin qmip = general qmip ] and corollary [ corollary : qip is in qmip(2,2,1,s ) ] in particular ) are not known to hold when considering only initially unentangled honest provers , and thus give first evidence that sharing prior entanglement may be advantageous even to honest provers .",

    "it is assumed that our circuits consist of unitary gates , which is sufficient since non - unitary and unitary quantum circuits are equivalent in computational power  @xcite . to avoid unnecessary complication , however , in the subsequent sections the descriptions of protocols often include non - unitary operations ( measurements ) . even in such cases , it is always possible to construct unitary quantum circuits that essentially achieve the same outcome .",
    "a notable exception is in the definition of the public - coin quantum verifier , where we want to define the public coin - flip to be a classical operation .",
    "this requires a non - unitary operation for the verifier , the ( classical ) public coin - flip .",

    "we can assume that in the case of honest provers ( @xmath116 ) the acceptance probability with shared state @xmath117 is exactly @xmath24 and furthermore that no other a priori shared state achieves higher acceptance probability .",
    "the acceptance probability when the provers use any a priori shared state @xmath58 can be written as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 , @xmath128 is the unitary transformation induced by the qmip system just before the verifier s final measurement , @xmath129 is the projection on @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the projection on @xmath64 of the designated output qubit . in other words the state @xmath132 maximizes the expression @xmath133 meaning that the matrix @xmath134 has maximum eigenvalue @xmath24 with corresponding eigenvector @xmath135 .",
    "now we apply the quantum rewinding technique by performing forward , backward , and forward executions of the proof system in sequence .",
    "perfect completeness follows from the fact that the initial state is an eigenvector of @xmath136 with the corresponding eigenvalue exactly @xmath24 , exactly as in the zero - knowledge scenario of @xcite .",
    "the challenge of this construction lies in the proof of soundness .",
    "if the input is a no - instance , the maximum eigenvalue of any matrix @xmath136 corresponding to our proof system is small .",
    "this shows that if the dishonest provers are actually `` not so dishonest '' , i.e. , if they use the same strategies for all of the three ( forward , backward , and forward ) executions of the original proof system , the acceptance probability is still small .",
    "however , the problem arises when the dishonest provers change their strategies for some of the three executions . to settle this",
    ", we design a simple protocol that tests if the backward execution is indeed a backward simulation of the first forward execution .",
    "the verifier performs the original rewinding protocol or this invertibility test uniformly at random without revealing which test the provers are undergoing .",
    "honest provers always pass this invertibility test , and thus perfect completeness is preserved .",
    "when the input is a no - instance , this forces the provers to use approximately the same strategies for the first two executions of the proof system , which is sufficient to bound the soundness .",
    "we now proceed with the technical details .",
    "let @xmath87 be a language in @xmath8 and let @xmath49 be the verifier in the perfectly rewindable @xmath9-turn quantum @xmath6-prover interactive proof system for @xmath87 as per lemma  [ lemma : making qmip perfectly rewindable ] .",
