    "extended theories of gravity are semi - classical approaches where the effective gravitational lagrangian is modified , with respect to the hilbert - einstein one , by considering higher order terms of curvature invariants , torsion tensor , derivatives of curvature invariants and scalar fields ( see for example @xcite ) . in particular , taking into account the ricci , riemann and weyl invariants , one can construct terms like @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9 that give rise to fourth - order theories in the metric formalism @xcite .",
    "considering minimally or nonminimally coupled scalar fields to the geometry , we deal with scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite . considering terms like @xmath10 @xmath11",
    ", we are dealing with higher - than fourth order theories @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 gravity is the simplest class of these models where a generic function of the ricci scalar @xmath5 is considered .",
    "the interest for these extended models is related both to the problem of quantum gravity @xcite and to the possibility to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe , as well as the structure formation , without invoking new particles in the matter / energy content of the universe @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the attempt is to address the dark side of the universe by changing the geometric sector and remaining unaltered the matter sources with respect to the standard model of particles .",
    "however , in the framework of this `` geometric picture '' , the debate is very broad involving the fundamental structures of gravitational interaction .",
    "just to summarize some points , gravity could be described only by metric ( in this case we deal with a metric approach ) , or by metric and connections ( in this case , we are considering a metric - affine approach @xcite ) , or by a purely affine approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dynamics could be related to curvature tensor , as in the original einstein theory , to both curvature and torsion @xcite , or to torsion only , as in the so called _ teleparallel gravity _",
    "@xcite .",
    "starting from these original theories and motivations , one can build more complex lagrangians , by using different combinations of curvature scalars and their derivatives , or topological invariants , such us the gauss - bonnet term , @xmath4 , as well as the torsion scalar @xmath1 .",
    "many theories have been proposed considering generic functions of such terms , like @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . however , the problem is _ how many _ and _ what kind _ of geometric invariants can be used , and furthermore what kind of physical information one can derive from them .",
    "for example , it is well known that @xmath12 gravity is the straightforward extension of the hilbert - einstein which is @xmath17 and @xmath14 is the extension of teleparallel gravity which is @xmath18 . however",
    ", if one wants to consider the whole information contained in curvature invariants , one has to take into account also combinations of riemann , ricci and weyl tensors , or derivative combinations of curvature invariants . ] . as discussed in @xcite , assuming a @xmath19 theory means to consider the whole curvature budget and then all the degrees of freedom related to curvature .",
    "assuming the teleparallel formalism , a @xmath20 theory , where @xmath21 is the torsional counterpart of the gauss - bonnet topological invariant , means to exhaust all the degrees of freedom related to torsion and then completely extend @xmath14 gravity .",
    "it is important to stress , as we will show below , that the gauss - bonnet invariant derived from curvature differs from the same topological invariant derived from torsion in less than a total derivative and then the dynamical information is the same in both representations . according to this result , the topological invariant allows a regularization of dynamics also in the teleparallel torsion picture ( see @xcite for a discussion in the curvature representation ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in sec.[tre ] , we sketch the basic ingredients of the @xmath20 theory showing , in particular , the equivalence between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "sec.[noether ] is devoted to derive the cosmological counterpart of the theory and to the derivation of the noether symmetry .",
    "the specific forms of @xmath20 function , selected by the noether symmetry , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ selection ] .",
    "cosmological solutions are given in sec .",
    "[ solutions ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec.[conclusion ] .",
    "in order to incorporate spin in a geometric description , as well as to bring gravity closer to its gauge formulation , people started , some years ago , to study torsion in gravity @xcite .",
    "an extensive review of torsional theories ( teleparallel , einstein - cartan , metric - affine , etc ) is presented in @xcite . if in the action of the teleparallel theory , i.e. in a curvature - free _ vierbein _ formulation , we replace the torsion scalar , @xmath1 , with a generic function of it , we obtain the so called @xmath14 gravity @xcite ,    in this paper , we will study a theory whose lagrangian is a generic function of the gauss - bonnet teleparallel term , @xmath23 and the torsion scalar , @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath24\\,,\\ ] ] which is a straightforward generalization of @xmath25\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the standard matter that , in the following considerations , we will discard .",
    "it is important to note that the field equations of @xmath14 gravity are of second order in the metric derivatives and thus simpler than those of @xmath12 gravity , which are of fourth order @xcite .",
    "the metric determinant @xmath27 can be derived from the determinant of the vierbeins @xmath28 as follows .",
    "we have @xmath29 the relation between metric and vierbiens is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the flat minkowski metric . finally , it is @xmath32 det@xmath33 .",
    "more details on how the two formalisms are related can be found in @xcite .",
    "the torsion scalar is given by the contraction @xmath34 where @xmath35 are respectively the superpotential , the contorsion tensor , the torsion tensor and @xmath36 is the weitzenbck connection .    imposing the teleparallelism condition ,",
    "the torsion scalar can be expressed as the sum of the ricci scalar plus a total derivative term , i.e. @xmath37 where @xmath38 here is the ricci scalar corresponding to the levi - civita connection and @xmath28 , as above , is the determinant of the metric . following @xcite , the teleparallel equivalent of the gauss - bonnet topological invariant can be obtained as , @xmath39 where the gauss - bonnet invariant , in terms of curvature , is @xmath40 and the teleparallel @xmath2 invariant is given by @xmath41 in a four dimensional spacetime , the term @xmath2 is a topological invariant , constructed out of torsion and contorsion tensor . in order to simplify the notation",
    ", we will identify @xmath2 with @xmath42 from now on .",
    "the field equations from the action are then @xmath43 where @xmath44 being @xmath45 .    in the discussion",
    "below , we will consider the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology related to @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath46 , and we search for noether symmetries in order to fix the form of the function @xmath47 and to derive exact cosmological solutions .",
    "let us consider a a spatially flat frw cosmology defined by the line element @xmath48 from which we can express the teleparallel gauss - bonnet term as a function of the scale factor @xmath49 @xcite @xmath50\\,.\\ ] ] as said above , we can discard the total derivative term ( see also @xcite ) the torsion scalar is @xmath51\\,.\\ ] ] we can reduce to a canonical point - like action by using the lagrange multipliers as @xmath52\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the gauss - bonnet term and the torsion scalar expressed by and .",
    "the lagrange multipliers are given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 and are obtained by varying the action with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "we can rewrite action as @xmath57\\ ] ] and discarding total derivative terms , the final lagrangian is @xmath58 this is a point - like , canonical lagrangian whose configuration space is @xmath59 and tangent space is @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath62 and @xmath1 are respectively @xmath63 as expected , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we obtain , from and , the expressions and for the gauss - bonnet term and the torsion scalar .",
    "the energy condition @xmath66 , associated with lagrangian , is @xmath67 corresponding to the 00-einstein equation @xmath68 alternatively , the system - can be derived from the field equations .",
    "let us now use the noether symmetry approach @xcite to find possible symmetries for the dynamical system given by lagrangian .",
    "in general , a lagrangian admits a noether symmetry if its lie derivative , along a vector field @xmath69 , vanishes @xmath70 alternatively , the existence of a symmetry depends on the existence of a vector ( a `` complete lift '' ) , which is defined on the tangent space of the lagrangian , i.e. @xmath71 being @xmath72 the configuration variables , @xmath73 the generalized velocities and @xmath74 the components of the noether vector . in our case , the lagrangian admits three degrees of freedom and then the symmetry generator reads @xmath75 the system derived from eq .",
    "consists of 10 partial differential equations ( see @xcite for details ) , for @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is overdetermined and , if solved , it allows us to determine the components of the noether vector and the form of @xmath79 .",
    "it is    @xmath80    clearly , being a system of partial differential equations , a theorem of existence and unicity for the solutions does not hold .",
    "however , if only one of the functions @xmath81 is different from zero , a noether symmetry exists .",
    "below , we will show that the existence of the symmetry selects the form of the function @xmath46 and allows to get exact solutions for the dynamical system - .",
    "in order to solve the above system , we have to do some assumptions .",
    "there are two ways to look for solutions : the first , is to assume specific families of @xmath79 and derive symmetries accordingly , i.e. find out the components of the symmetry vector .",
    "the second approach consists in imposing a specific form for the symmetry vector and then finding the form of @xmath79 .",
    "however , in the second case , the chosen functions @xmath82 must be solution of the system - . to obtain physically reliable models ,",
    "the first route can be more convenient . in this preliminary paper",
    ", we will adopt this strategy to find out solutions choosing classes of @xmath79 function .",
    "we substitute this form of @xmath79 in the system - and obtain that for @xmath84 and arbitrary @xmath85 , the only possible noether vector is the trivial one , @xmath86 , which means that there is no symmetry .",
    "however , for @xmath87 and arbitrary @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath88 , the vector assume the non - trivial form @xmath89 with @xmath90 being an arbitrary integration constant and any non singular @xmath91 .",
    "this means that this theory admits a symmetry with the conserved quantity being @xmath92 which coincides with the case @xmath93 and then the contribution of the gauss - bonnet invariant is trivial .",
    "this is expected since , in a 4-dimensional manifold , the linear gauss - bonnet term is vanishing in the action and thus this model is not different from @xmath14 gravity .      in this case , the system - becomes slightly more complicated . as previously",
    ", we have two possible choices of the powers @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath96 , @xmath79 reduces to pure @xmath14 , i.e. we have to set @xmath97 and therefore we have the same symmetries as before . nevertheless , if @xmath98 , the model becomes @xmath99 and it admits a noether symmetry denoted by the vector @xmath100 where @xmath91 is a non - singular function .",
    "it is interesting to point out the analogy with the curvature case , where the noether symmetry approach selects the form @xmath101 as discussed in @xcite . in some sense",
    ", symmetries preserve the structure of gravitational theories independently of the teleparallel or metric formulation gives a symmetry . ] .",
    "starting from the model @xmath102 , let us find out cosmological solutions for any values of @xmath103 .",
    "the lagrangian assumes the form @xmath104\\,.\\ ] ] and the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath49 and the energy equation become @xmath105 while the other two , i.e. for @xmath4 and @xmath1 give the lagrange multipliers and . if we substitute the constraints , into eq . , we get @xmath106 these general ( for arbitrary @xmath84 ) equations admit power law solutions for the scale factor of the form @xmath107 it is easy to verify that the gauss - bonnet term and the torsion scalar behave asymptotically as @xmath108 and @xmath109 for any @xmath103 .    from these considerations ,",
    "it is easy to realize that any friedmann - like , power law solution can be achieved according to the value of @xmath103 .",
    "for example , a dust solution is recovered for @xmath110 a radiation solution is for @xmath111 and a stiff matter one is for @xmath112 power - law inflationary solutions are achieved , in general , for @xmath113 and then @xmath114 .",
    "in this paper , we discussed a theory of gravity where the interaction lagrangian consists of a generic function @xmath115 of the teleparallel gauss - bonnet topological invariant , @xmath2 , and the torsion scalar @xmath1 .",
    "the physical reason for this approach is related to the fact that we want to study a theory where the full budget of torsional degrees of freedom are considered .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to show that , from a dynamical point of view , the gauss - bonnet invariant , derived from curvature , @xmath22 , and the gauss - bonnet invariant , derived from torsion , @xmath2 , are equivalent and then we can consider a @xmath116 theory .    after these considerations , we searched for noether symmetries in the cosmology derived from this model .",
    "we showed that specific forms of @xmath79 admit symmetries and allow the reduction of the dynamical system .    in particular , the class @xmath117 results particularly interesting and , depending on the value of @xmath103 , it is possible to achieve all the behaviors of standard cosmology as particular solutions .",
    "clearly , other cases can be considered and a systematic approach to find out other solutions can be pursued .",
    "this will be the argument of a forthcoming paper where a general cosmological analysis will be developed .",
