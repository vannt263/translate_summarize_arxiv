    "determination of @xmath0 is critical because the shape of @xmath8 extracted from the data on @xmath9 depends sensitively on the value of @xmath0 adopted , and a wrong @xmath0 could lead to incorrect conclusions on the superconducting order parameter .",

    ", the absolute value of @xmath10 can be determined as well , but with much lower precision compared to @xmath11.@xcite other techniques which are used to measure @xmath0 include muon spin rotation ( @xmath12sr),@xcite infrared spectroscopy,@xcite and microwave cavity perturbation technique,@xcite and local probes.@xcite however , each of these techniques has its own limitations .",
    "@xmath12sr measures averaged @xmath13 in the mixed state and extrapolated to @xmath14 value is used to estimate @xmath0 . in infrared spectroscopy , @xmath0 is deduced from the measured plasma frequency , which is not a precisely determined quantity.@xcite local probes , such as scanning squid @xcite and mfm @xcite magnetometry , infer @xmath10 from the analysis of magnetic interactions between a relevant probe and a magnetic moment induced in a superconductor.@xcite    in this paper we show that the thermodynamic relation between the specific heat jump , @xmath1 , and the slope of thermodynamic critical field , @xmath15 , at the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath3 , first proposed by rutgers @xcite , can be rewritten in terms of measurable quantities , - the slopes of the upper critical field and of the superfluid density in addition to specific heat jump . as a general thermodynamic relation valid at the 2nd order transition ( excluding critical fluctuation region ) , it is applicable for any superconductor irrespective of the pairing symmetry , scattering or multiband nature of superconductivity , as we verified on several well - known systems .",
    "such general applicability of the rutgers relation offers a method of estimating @xmath0 if @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath3 are known .",
    "this idea is checked on nb and mgb@xmath16 and applied to several unconventional superconductors . in all cases we use @xmath17 measured by the tdr technique and",

    "is , of course , valid since the condensation energy and @xmath40 do not depend on direction .",

    "in addition to the aforementioned uncertainties , determination of the experimental @xmath76 is not trivial even if the quality of measurement is excellent since @xmath49 near @xmath64 is often significantly curved due to several experimental artifacts , most importantly due to the influence of the normal skin effect near @xmath3 , which is more pronounced for higher frequency measurements on highly conducting materials .",
    "tdr technique uses typically @xmath77 mhz , so this effect is weak in most of the materials concerned . analyzing the data for different superconductors , we have found that the data in the regime between @xmath78 and 0.95 works well for the determination of @xmath51 .",
    "the experimental @xmath76 in this work is determined from the best linear fit of @xmath49 data in this range .",
    "the same procedure can be employed for a well known multi gap superconductor mgb@xmath16 ( shown in the bottom row of fig .",

    "@xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 for the selected compounds have been measured by various techniques by different groups .",

    "it is known@xcite that in isotropic materials , @xmath92 it is easy to reproduce this result for the free electron model of the normal state ; it is shown below , however , that this value holds for any fermi surface provided the order parameter is isotropic .    here , we are interested in relating @xmath0 and @xmath93 , the @xmath24 independent part of @xmath5 near @xmath3 , for anisotropic fermi surfaces and order parameters .",
    "we start with a known relation , @xmath94 which holds at any temperature for _ clean _ materials with arbitrary fermi surface and order parameter anisotropies.@xcite here , @xmath95 is the density of states at the fermi level per spin , @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the zero - field order parameter which in general depends on the position @xmath99 on the fermi surface , and @xmath100 stand for averaging over the fermi surface .",
    "the function @xmath101 which describes the variation of @xmath102 along the fermi surface , is normalized : @xmath103 .",
    "eq.([lambda - tensor ] ) is obtained within the model of factorizable effective coupling @xmath104.@xcite the self - consistency equation of the weak coupling theory takes the form : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the eilenberger green s function which , for the uniform current - free state , reads : @xmath107 .",
    "the order parameter near @xmath3 is now readily obtained : @xmath108 which reduces to the isotropic bcs form for @xmath109 .",
    "we substitute this in eq.([lambda - tensor ] ) to obtain near @xmath3 : @xmath110 from which the constants @xmath93 for any direction readily follow .    as @xmath111 , the sum over the matsubara frequencies in eq.([lambda - tensor ] ) can be replaced with an integral according to @xmath112 : @xmath113 for free electrons , this reduces to the london value @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the electron density .",
    "hence , we get for the slope of the in - plane superfluid density : @xmath116 similarly , one can define @xmath117 for which @xmath118 should be replaced with @xmath119 in eq.([ratios ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have : @xmath120 e.g. , for mgb@xmath16 with @xmath121 , @xmath122 , we estimate @xmath123 .",
    "consider a simple two - band model with the gap anisotropy given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 are two sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath128 are assumed constants , in other words , we model mgb@xmath16 as having two different s - wave gaps .",
    "the normalization @xmath129 then gives : @xmath130 where @xmath131 are the relative densities of states .",
    "further , we use the averages over separate fermi sheets calculated in ref . :",
    "@xmath138 , @xmath139@xmath140/s@xmath141 . with this input ,",
    "we estimate @xmath142 it should be noted that this number is sensitive to a number of input parameters . the procedure described above ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , gives @xmath143 .",
    "since only even powers of @xmath144 enter eq.([ratios ] ) , the same analysis of the slope @xmath124 can , in fact , be exercised for materials modeled by two bands with the @xmath145 symmetry of the order parameter , for which @xmath144 s have opposite signs .",
    "if the bands relative densities of state @xmath146 and the averages @xmath147 are comparable to each other and similar to those of mgb@xmath16 , we expect a similar @xmath148 for clean crystals .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath149 for closed fermi surfaces as rotational ellipsoids ( in particular , spheres ) or open ones as rotational hyperboloids ( in particular , cylinders).@xcite a straightforward algebra gives : @xmath150      in the limit of a strong non - magnetic scattering for an arbitrary fermi surface but a constant s - wave order parameter we have , see , e.g , ref .",
    ": @xmath151 here @xmath152 is the average scattering time .",
    "it is worth noting that the dirty limit does not make much sense for anisotropic gaps because @xmath3 is suppressed even by non - magnetic scattering in the limit @xmath153 . at @xmath154",
    ", we have @xmath155 whereas near @xmath3 @xmath156 since for non - magnetic scattering , @xmath3 and @xmath157 are the same as in the clean case , in particular @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath159 we thus conclude that scattering causes the slope @xmath160 to increase .    evaluation of scattering effects on the slope @xmath161 near @xmath3 for anisotropic gaps and fermi surfaces are more involved because both @xmath3 and @xmath102 are affected even by non - magnetic scattering .",
