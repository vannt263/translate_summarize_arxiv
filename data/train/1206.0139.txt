    "to gain a deeper understanding of the physics involved in stellar core collapse , supernova explosion and protoneutron star evolution , an equation of state capable of describing matter ranging from very low densities to few times the saturation density and from zero temperature to a few @xmath1 is needed .    the crust of the star",
    "is essentially determined by the low density region of the equation of state ( eos ) , while the high density part will be important to define properties such as the star mass and radius .",
    "understanding the crust constitution of a neutron star is an important issue because it influences the cooling process of the star and plays a decisive role on quantities such as the neutrino emissivity and gravitational waves emission .    in the outer crust , where the density is lower",
    ", the formation of light clusters in nuclear matter will be energetically favorable at finite temperature , as in core - collapse supernovae or neutron star mergers , whereas in catalyzed cold neutron stars only heavy nuclei appear . at very low densities and moderate temperatures ,",
    "the few body correlations are expected to become important and the system minimizes its free energy by forming light nuclei like deuterons ( @xmath2 ) , tritons ( @xmath3 ) , helions ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5-particles ( @xmath6 ) due to the increased entropy @xcite .",
    "eventually , these clusters will dissolve at higher densities due to pauli blocking resulting in an homogeneous matter @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cooling process of a protoneutron star is affected by the appearance of light clusters @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of light clusters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 particles ) in the nuclear matter eos is discussed in @xcite , where the most important thermodynamical quantities are calculated within a density - dependent relativistic model .",
    "the conditions for the liquid - gas phase transition are obtained , and it is seen how the binodal section is affected by the inclusion of these clusters . moreover , an eos is obtained starting at low densities with clusterized matter up to high density cluster - free homogeneous matter . in this work",
    "the density and temperature dependence of the in - medium binding energy of the clusters was determined within a quantum statistical approach @xcite and included in a phenomenological way in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model with density dependent couplings .",
    "the @xmath5 particle is the most strongly bound system among all light nuclei and it certainly plays a role in nuclear matter as has been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "lattimer and swesty @xcite worked out the eos in the compressible extended liquid drop model based on a non - relativistic framework appropriate for supernova simulations , for a wide range of densities , proton fractions and temperatures , including the contribution of @xmath5 particle clusters .",
    "an excluded volume prescription is used to model the dissolution of @xmath5 particles at high densities .",
    "the same is done by h. shen et al . in @xcite where non - uniform matter composed of protons , neutrons , @xmath5 particles and a single species of heavy nuclei is described with the thomas - fermi approximation and the tm1 parametrization of the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) . at low densities ,",
    "these particles are described by classical gases .    in @xcite the virial expansion of low - density nuclear matter composed by neutrons , protons , and @xmath5 particles",
    "is presented , and it is shown that the predicted @xmath5 particles concentrations differ from the predictions of the eos proposed in @xcite and @xcite . the virial expansion was extended to include other light clusters with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "all possible light clusters were also included in recent eos appropriate for simulations of core - collapse supernovae based in a nuclear statistical equilibrium model , including excluded volume effects for nuclei @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the dissolution density of light clusters , i.e. the density above which light clusters do not exist anymore , in uniform nuclear matter within the framework of the nlwm @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the dissolution density on the cluster - meson couplings as well as on the proton - fraction will be studied . in many models which include light clusters the dissolution density",
    "is determined by excluded volume effects @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a statistical excluded volume model was compared with two quantum many - body models , a generalized relativistic mean - field model @xcite and a quantum statistical model @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the excluded volume description works reasonably well at high temperatures , partly due to a reduced pauli blocking .",
    "however , at low temperatures the excluded volume approach shows crucial deviations from the statistical approach .    in @xcite , using a rmf approach , the coupling of the @xmath5-clusters to the @xmath11-meson was employed to describe the dissolution . in this reference",
    "it was assumed that the intensity of the @xmath11 meson - cluster coupling was proportional to the mass number of the light cluster and no coupling to the @xmath12-meson was included .",
    "the light clusters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 particles ) are treated as point like particles ( without internal structure ) within the rmf approximation .",
    "just as the nucleons in nuclear matter , the clusters interact through the exchange of @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 meson fields . in order to understand",
    "how dependent are the results on the nlwm parametrization we consider three different parametrizations ; nl3 @xcite , with a quite large symmetry energy and incompressibility at saturation and which was fitted in order to reproduce the ground state properties of both stable and unstable nuclei ; fsu @xcite and iu - fsu @xcite , which were accurately calibrated to simultaneously describe the gmr in @xmath14zr and @xmath15pb , and the ivgdr in @xmath15pb and still reproduce ground - state observables of stable and unstable nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the iu - fsu was also refined to describe neutron stars with high masses ( @xmath16 ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a generalized rmf model with density dependent couplings was developed including clusters as explicit degrees of freedom , the medium effects on the binding energy of the clusters were introduced explicitly through density and temperature dependent terms .",
    "we aim at getting a description of the light clusters in nuclear matter that is simpler to implement , yet more realistic than the excluded volume mechanism .",
    "a brief review of the formalism is presented in section [ formalism ] , the results and discussion of the meson - cluster coupling constants are given in section [ results ] and conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a system of protons and neutrons interacting with and through an isoscalar - scalar field @xmath12 with mass @xmath17 , an isoscalar - vector field @xmath18 with mass @xmath19 , an isovector - vector field @xmath20 with mass @xmath21 and light clusters : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 particles .",

    "all the @xmath5 and deuteron populations will condense in a state of zero momentum , therefore @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to the condensate density of each specie .",

    "we also include results obtained in @xcite at @xmath0 mev , which turn out to be very close to the calculated binding energies settings @xmath60 . in order to reproduce the results of @xcite we must consider temperature dependent @xmath12-cluster .",
    "we note , however , that choosing a temperature dependent parameter will alter the usual thermodynamic relations between energy density and pressure . in fig .",
    "[ mott](b ) we compare the in - medium binding energy of the four light clusters obtained in our calculation setting @xmath61 with the results of @xcite : the best accordance occurs for the @xmath5-clusters .",
    "we may get a better accordance for all the clusters if a different coupling fraction @xmath62 is taken for each cluster .    in fig .",
    "[ exp ] we compare the mott densities , the densities at which the binding energies defined in ( [ bind ] ) vanish , at @xmath0 setting @xmath61 ( open triangles ) with the experimental mott points determined in @xcite ( full dots with errorbars ) and the parametrization of the mott point given in @xcite ( dashed lines ) .",
    "results in @xcite are obtained at different temperatures for the four light clusters , however , all temperatures lie close to 5 mev .",
    "we conclude that choosing @xmath60 , and the corresponding @xmath63 and @xmath64 couplings defined in table [ tab : fit ] , at @xmath0 mev in our model , gives results that are in reasonable agreement with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite for the mott density .    as a test of the parametrizations proposed for @xmath65 in table [",

    "[ fraction](b ) we compare two models , nl3 ( dashed lines ) and fsu ( full lines ) .",
    "it is seen that the results do not differ much except for the deuterons that dissolve at a larger density and attain a larger fraction with nl3 . at very low densities",
    "when the interaction between nucleons and clusters is negligible both models coincide ; at densities just below the dissolution density , where models differ the most , the differences are not very large .",
    "the effect of temperature and isopsin asymmetry is shown in fig . [ fraction](c ) and ( d ) . in fig .",

    "the large amount of deuterons is in agreement with results of @xcite , where composition of low - density supernova matter composed of light nuclei was calculated within a quasiparticle gas model , and @xcite , where composition of the outer layers of a protoneutron star was studied .",
    "in the present work we have included light clusters in the eos of nuclear matter within the framework of relativistic mean field models with constant coupling constants .",
    "clusters are considered point - like particles that interact with the nucleons through the exchange of mesons .",
    "the formation of clusters is favorable at a quite low density ; below 0.002 @xmath72 , we expect that it is a reasonable approximation to consider them as point like .",
    "it was shown that the dissolution of clusters is mainly determined by the isoscalar part of the eos .",
    "therefore , the @xmath13-cluster coupling constant was simply determined by the isospin of the cluster . to fix the @xmath12 and @xmath11 clusters couplings two constraints",
