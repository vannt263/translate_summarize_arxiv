    "density functional theory ( dft ) , based on the celebrated theorems of hohenberg and kohn @xcite , is today s method of choice for the description of groundstate ( gs ) properties of quantum systems .",
    "there are , however , cases in which dft performs rather poorly .",
    "prominent examples are the so - called mott insulators , for which some of the transition metal oxides constitute the best - studied representatives . for this type of strongly correlated systems ,",
    "the kohn - sham description with standard exchange - correlation functionals typically yields a metallic ground state while the true experimental low - temperature phase is that of an antiferromagnetic insulator .    at finite temperature",
    "the description of strongly correlated systems is even more challenging .",
    "genuine mott insulators are characterized by the feature that , when heated up from their antiferromagnetic insulating gs , they stay insulating above the nel temperature , i.e. in the absence of long - range magnetic order . by contrast , weakly correlated `` slater '' insulators become metallic at the nel temperature .    one possible way to tackle this challenge is to search for more accurate functionals in the framework of dft .",
    "alternatively one may look for other theoretical frameworks in which the treatment of strong correlation might be easier .",
    "one candidate for such a framework is reduced density matrix functional theory ( rdmft ) . through its more direct treatment of many - particle correlations",
    "it has shown big promise for the description of finite @xcite as well as infinite systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was possible to predict insulating ground states for transition metal oxides without breaking the spin symmetry @xcite",
    ".    motivated by the success at zero temperature , the purpose of the present work is to lay the theoretical foundation for the finite - temperature version of rdmft ( ft - rdmft ) .",
    "as this theory will be a truly general ab - initio theory its applicability is not restricted to the case of mott insulators .",
    "there is a wide variety of physical phenomena whose investigation require an accurate description of temperature effects .",
    "these phenomena include temperature driven magnetic @xcite or superconducting @xcite phase transitions in solids , properties of shock compressed noble gases @xcite , femtochemistry at surfaces of solids @xcite , the properties of plasmas @xcite , and the composition of different phases of water in the interior of giant planets @xcite .",
    "to lay the foundation for ft - rdmft we will show that at finite temperatures the grand potential of systems with generally nonlocal external potentials can be written as a functional of the one - reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) .",
    "the domain of the functional is then shown to be determined by just a few simple constraints .",
    "we will prove the existence of a one - to - one mapping between the 1rdm at equilibrium and the corresponding statistical density operator ( sdo ) .",
    "furthermore , we will show that at finite temperatures there exists a noninteracting kohn - sham system with possibly nonlocal external potential which reproduces the 1rdm of the fully interacting many - body system .",
    "the above mentioned facts have several important consequences .",
    "firstly , the kohn - sham system can be employed to establish self - consistent minimization procedures which is not possible at zero temperature ( where no kohn - sham - like system exists ) @xcite .",
    "secondly , the existence of this kohn - sham - like system also has the benefit of giving easy access to one - electron properties ( like in dft ) .",
    "thirdly , the domain of external potentials includes nonlocal potentials ( e.g. pseudopotentials @xcite ) , for which the original hohenberg - kohn theorems of dft and ft - dft do not hold @xcite .",
    "furthermore , based on the kohn - sham system of ft - rdmft we shall derive a methodology to iteratively construct functionals of the 1rdm by employing finite temperature many body perturbation theory ( ft - mbpt ) .",
    "we will conclude this work by considering the case of fixed particle number @xmath3 , i.e. we will discuss how the results for grand canonical ensembles differ from the ones for canonical ensembles .",
    "part ii @xcite and iii @xcite of this work will investigate the performance of ft - rdmft when applied to the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "part ii will focuss on the first - order , i.e. exchange - only , functional considering both collinear as well as spin spiral states .",
    "part iii will then discuss correlation contributions in the framework of ft - rdmft focussing on correlation energies , momentum distributions and phase diagrams for collinear spin configurations .",
    "we start from the standard definition of the sdo @xmath4 , which is a weighted sum of projection operators on the underlying hilbert space . @xmath5",
    "if one considers grand canonical ensembles , one has to allow for a change of particle number .",
    "the appropriate hilbert space is then given as the direct sum of symmetrized tensor products of the one - particle hilbert space @xmath6 which is called the fock space @xmath7 , @xmath8 as long as the system does not allow a mixing of states with different particle numbers it is possible to reduce the set of all possible sdo from eq .",
    "( [ eq.sdo ] ) and only use projection operators on states with defined particle number @xmath3 .",

    "the neccessary and sufficient conditions for n - representability of @xmath17 are @xcite that @xmath26 is a complete set and @xmath27 it is sometimes desirable to treat spin and spacial variables seperately . to this end",
    "we introduce a two - component ( pauli ) spinor notation .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 are the orbitals of eq .",
    "( [ eq.def.1rdm.2 ] ) .",
    "the 1rdm can then be written as a matrix in spin space as @xmath30 there are some cases in which one can treat different spin channels seperately",
    ". one of these special cases is the particulary important situation of collinear spin configuration . for these systems ,",
    "the natural orbitals are so - called spin orbitals , i.e. spinors containing only one spin component .",
    "we characterize these spin orbitals by an additional index .",
    "@xmath31 this then leads to a 1rdm where every 2x2 matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq.rdm.22 ] ) contains only one nonvanishing entry , either the 11 or the 22 one .",
    "hence the complete 1rdm is diagonal w.r.t .",

    "( [ eq.1rdm.no.special ] ) .",
    "another special case where this seperation is possible is the case of spin spiral states which will be dealt with in part ii @xcite of this work .",
    "we will now turn to the question of the existence of a kohn - sham system in rdmft , i.e. a noninteracting system which reproduces the gs-1rdm or eq-1rdm of an interacting system . when dealing with coulomb systems , i.e. systems where the two - particle interaction is @xmath35 , the following theorem",
    "was shown @xcite .    _",
    "the gs-1rdm of a coulomb system at zero temperature has an infinite number of occupied orbitals , i.e. natural orbitals with occupation numbers @xmath36 .",
    "_    the original proof is rather involved and we therefore present an alternative simpler version in the following .",
    "as kato showed in 1957 @xcite , the divergence of the coulomb interaction for vanishing inter - particle distances leads to a nucleus - electron as well as an electron - electron cusp in the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "every eigenfunction is an element of the general n - particle hilbert space of the system and can therefore be expanded in any basis of this hilbert space .",
    "furthermore , we know that one can create an n - particle basis by constructing all possible n - particle slater determinants of a given one - particle basis . as in a slater determinant a particular one - particle wavefunction `` does not know '' about the coordinates of another one , the electron - electron cusp condition can not be fulfilled by a superposition of a finite number of slater determinants .",
    "one therefore needs an infinite number of slater determinants to reproduce an eigenfunction of a coulomb system .",
    "this argument is valid for all one - particle bases , including the set of natural orbitals of the gs-1rdm .",
    "if an infinite number of n - particle wavefunctions contributes , then the number of contributing one - particle natural orbitals also has to be infinite , implying the statement above .    as the ground state wavefunction of a noninteracting nondegenerate system is a single slater determinant ,",
    "the gs-1rdm of a noninteracting system will be idempotent .",
    "therefore , we conclude that at zero temperature there exists no kohn - sham system for coulomb systems .",
    "we would like to mention , however , that a statistical mixture of the degenerate ground states of a noninteracting system is capable of reproducing a 1rdm with partially occupied natural orbitals @xcite but the degree of degeneracy is equal to the number of partially occupied states . for a coulomb system",
    "therefore the degeneracy must be infinite .",
    "we will show in the following that at finite temperature this disadvantage disappears , by proving the _ existence _ of a kohn - sham system in ft - rdmft .",
    "we will show how the kohn - sham hamiltonian can be constructed directly , i.e. from an explicit analytical formula , from the occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the interacting 1rdm .",
    "this direct construction is an advantage over dft where , if one wants to evaluate the kohn - sham potential for a given density , the single - particle schrdinger equation must be inverted numerically .",
    "this is in general a nontrivial task which can be achieved by iterative methods @xcite .      in order to show the existence of a kohn - sham system in the context of ft - rdmft , it is instructive to consider an arbitrary noninteracting fermionic system defined by the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath37 with eigenvalues @xmath38 and eigenfunctions @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath39 for a grand canonical ensemble , the eq-1rdm is then @xcite given by @xmath40 where the occupation numbers @xmath24 are determined completely by the eigenvalues @xmath38 and the chemical potential @xmath12 @xmath41 this relation can be inverted to give @xmath42 from eq.([eq.e.n ] ) , it is now possible to construct the kohn - sham hamiltonian from a given 1rdm .",
