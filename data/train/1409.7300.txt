    "however in this study the absolute value of the ebic current plays a central role in our analysis .",
    "we next describe ebic experiments in more detail in order to set the stage for the challenges of ebic for materials like cdte .",

    "the development of _ quantitative _ analysis of ebic in these materials has been hampered due to several factors , some of which we enumerate here : 1 .",
    "the influence of grain boundaries .",
    "while ebic has been developed and used to study grain boundaries in si ( determining the recombination velocity for example @xcite ) , the study of grain boundaries in materials like cdte and copper indium gallium selenide ( cigs ) remains qualitative for the most part .",
    "this is due to the varying influence of grain boundaries in these materials - with proper sample treatment , grain boundaries become passivated and may collect more current than grain interiors @xcite . additionally grain boundaries in these materials are charged @xcite , leading to a complex distribution of electrostatic fields in the device .",
    "a proper account of carrier collection from grain boundaries requires a 3-dimensional deconvolution of the measured current , posing a significant challenge .",
    "strong surface effects : to properly resolve grain boundaries at low beam energies , a flat exposed surface is required in order to minimize the effects of roughness on the signal , which can overwhelm the grain boundary contrast . the most common surface treatment is focused ion beam milling .",
    "this process can introduce significant changes in the surface composition and electronic properties , which can strongly influence the ebic signal .",
    "the introduction of surface charge by ga implantation , for example , requires additional modeling beyond a surface recombination velocity boundary condition .",
    "3 . the effect of low mobility and/or low doping combined with the high electron - hole pair generation rate density from the electron beam excitation . the combination of these two effects may result in a nonlinear response of the system , by for example screening the built - in electric field from the high density of nonequilibrium charges , or leading to an increased contribution from radiative and auger recombination mechanisms - these processes become important for higher nonequilibrium charge density .    in practice",
    ", the ebic signal contains a convolution of all three of these factors , making it difficult to gain an understanding of any one factor without knowing all three .",
    "we have explored these three factors in detail , and will present the analysis of each in a series of forthcoming papers . in the current work ,",
    "we focus on a subset of factor 3 ( high injection ) by examining the maximum collection efficiency of the ebic signal for cdte solar cells . by carefully estimating the number of electron - hole pairs generated by the electron beam , we find that the maximum value of the collection effiency is well below 1 , violating the assumption that all carriers generated within the depletion region are collected . a reduced internal quantum efficiency in cdte has also been observed for optical excitation experiments at strongly absorbed wavelengths @xcite , where most electron - hole pair generation is within the depletion region . as we discuss next",
    ", any degree of recombination in the depletion region imposes strong constraints on the system and material properties .    for typical material parameters , the charge separation from the internal field @xmath14 of a _",
    "p - n _ junction is very rapid .",
    "for a built - in field of @xmath15 and mobility @xmath16 , drift velocities of @xmath17 are attained , and free charges separate faster than typical recombination times @xmath18 ( typically greater than @xmath19 ) .",
    "any substantial recombination therefore requires a considerable reduction in @xmath0 and/or in the built - in electric field @xmath14 .",
    "here we focus on the reduction in collection efficiency due to a reduced value for @xmath0 within the depletion region .",
    "previous work considers a reduction in @xmath14 due to screening from nonequilibrium charges in a high charge injection regime @xcite . in this work , we find that recombination in the depletion region is important when the diffusion length @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the diffusivity ) is greater than the drift length @xmath22 .",
    "this can also be expressed as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath25 is temperature , and @xmath26 is the absolute value of the electron charge . for typical material parameters , @xmath27",
    ", so that a strong reduction in @xmath0 is necessary for substantial recombination in the depletion region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present experimental results of ebic response of cdte solar cells which demonstrate a maximum collection efficiency of less than 1 . in sec .",
    "iii we describe an analytical model of the ebic response which accounts for recombination within the depletion region , and show that it matches numerical simulations very well . in sec .",
    "iv , we re - examine the ebic data with this new model .",
    "we find that in order to match experimental data , @xmath0 must be spatially dependent , reaching a minimum in the depletion region and increasing into the neutral region .",
    "we comment on the possible origin for the reduced efficiency , and consider radiative recombination due to the high generation rate densities associated with the electron beam excitation .",
    "we first describe the cross - sectional ebic measurements performed on @xmath28 cds - @xmath29 cdte photovoltaic cells . to indicate the generality of the results , we present data from two rather different samples , with nominal cdte thicknesses of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and respective power conversion efficiencies of 13 % and 10 % .",
    "we refer to the thinner ( thicker ) sample as  sample 1 ( 2 ) \" .",
    "the cross sectional samples are prepared by cleaving .",
    "we have also characterized devices prepared with surface focused ion beam milling ( fib ) using ga ions .",
    "we ve found that fib preparation leads to substantial surface effects which will be described in later work .",
    "as discussed in appendix a , there is significant lateral variation in the ebic signal due to the presence of grain boundaries .",
    "we carefully select a linescan from the center of a large grain to minimize the grain boundary influence on the signal .",
    "acquisition of ebic at different electron energies was performed with an indium contact on indium tin oxide ( ito)/@xmath32-cds and a metal probe tip on @xmath29-cdte / cu / au . we present results in terms of the ebic efficiency @xmath33 , defined as the ratio of the measured current to the total generation rate of electron - hole pairs @xmath34 , where @xmath26 is the absolute value of the electron charge .",

    "we estimate 10  % uncertainty in the measured ebic efficiency @xmath33 ( all uncertainties are reported as one standard deviation ) .",
    "the dominant sources of uncertainty are from the beam current , and from the inhomogeneous material composition , which introduces uncertainty into the the backscattering coefficient ( performed for pure cdte ) .",
