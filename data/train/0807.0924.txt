    "voids in the distribution of galaxies are an important ingradient of the distribution of light and mass in the universe .",
    "they constitute a natural outcome of structure formation via gravitational instability , and , thus , can be used to constrain theories of galaxy formation .",
    "emptiness of voids  the number of small galaxies in the voids  is an interesting question for both the observations and the theory to tackle @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations predict ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that many small dm haloes should reside in voids",
    ". there seems to be no disagreement between the @xmath14cdm theory and the observations regarding the giant voids defined by @xmath15 galaxies or by @xmath16 haloes @xcite .",
    "the situation is less clear on smaller scales . in the region of @xmath17mpc around the milky way , where observations go to remarkably low luminosities , small voids look very empty :",
    "dwarf galaxies do not show a tendency to fill the voids and voids are still relatively large .",
    "the theory predicts that many dwarf dark matter haloes should be in the voids , which puts it on a collision course with observations .",
    "yet , below some mass the haloes are expected to stop producing galaxies inside them .",
    "there are different arguments for that : stellar feedback @xcite or photoionization @xcite may play a significant role in quenching star formation in too small haloes .",
    "for example , @xcite made a simple estimation of the limiting circular velocity below which haloes have essentially no gas infall due to increase of jeans mass caused by uv background at the epoch of reionization : @xmath18km / s , where @xmath19 is the temperature of intergalactic medium gas ionized by stars .",
    "@xcite studied formation of dwarf dm haloes in cosmological void regions using high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations and assuming that cosmological uv - background photo - evaporates baryons out of haloes of dwarf galaxies , and thereby limits their cooling and star formation rate .",
    "@xcite give characteristic mass @xmath20 below which haloes start to fail accreting gas .",
    "theoretical estimates for the least massive luminous halo are still uncertain .",
    "it is difficult to get a definite answer because the physics of dwarf galaxies at high redshifts is quite complicated .",
    "star formation histories of some isolated irregular dwarfs indicate that starbursts may produce enough power to throw gas away , but not sufficient for galaxy to get rid of it  gas again returns to potential well of the dm halo , hosting the galaxy @xcite .",
    "satellites of the local group shed light on the problem from a different direction .",
    "the @xmath14cdm model predicts that thousands of dwarf dm haloes should exist in the local group @xcite , while only @xmath21 are observed .",
    "recent discoveries of very low luminosity dwarfs @xcite and careful analysis of incompleteness effects in sdss @xcite bring the theory and observations a bit closer , but the mismatch still seems to be present .",
    "the currently favored explanation of the overabundance of the dark matter subhaloes @xcite assumes that dwarf haloes above @xmath22km / s were forming stars before they fall into the milky way or m31 and that smaller haloes never formed any substantial amount of stars .",
    "once the haloes above the limit fall into the halo of the milky way or m31 , they get severely stripped and may substantially reduce their circular velocity producing galaxies such as draco or fornax with the rms line - of - sight velocities onlya few km / s .",
    "the largest subhaloes retain their gas and continue to form stars , while smaller ones may lose the gas and become dwarf spheroidals",
    ". haloes below the limit never had substantial star formation .",
    "they are truly dark .",
    "this scenario implies that circular velocity before the infall @xmath23km / s is the limit for star formation in haloes . @xcite",
    "give additional arguments in favor of this scenario .",
    "if this picture is correct , it can be tested using the abundance and the distribution of dwarf galaxies outside of the local group . because dwarfs can only be detected at small distances , useful observational samples are limited to distances less than 10mpc .    while the local volume sample of galaxies is not as deep as the sample of satellite galaxies in the local group , we argue that the local volume dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study the smallest and the darkest galaxies . the problem with using the lg satellites",
    "is related with the fact that the satellites have been tidally stripped by the milky way or by m31 . indeed ,",
    "theoretical estimates indicate that a very substantial mass loss occurs even at very small distances from the centres of the dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we really do not know whether we deal with a truly low mass and low circular velocity satellite or with a satellite , which was much more massive in the past and was later severely stripped by its parent galaxy .",
    "the local volume dwarfs represent a more pristine sample in this respect .",
    "the problem of the emptiness of voids was recently re - visited by @xcite with the conclusion that voids are not a problem for the @xmath14cdm model .",
    "most of the observational results used in @xcite are based on the void probability function in the sdss dr6 sample and on the nearest neighbor statistics in the ors catalog as analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the void probability function was estimated for relatively bright galaxies with @xmath24 .",
    "the nearest neighbor statistics goes slightly deeper : the ors sample is formally complete to @xmath25 , which gives @xmath26 at the distance of 8mpc .",
    "our sample is 3 magnitudes deeper , which is essential for the `` void phenomenon '' .",
    "we also note that the quality of our sample is much better than that of the ors sample .",
    "for example , we use real distances to galaxies , not redshifts .",
    "special effort was made to ensure that the sample is complete for lsb galaxies and for galaxies in the zone of avoidance .",
    "@xcite presented results on statistics of nearby voids in the local volume . here",
    "we continue the analysis using an updated list of galaxies ( karachentsev , private communication ) .",
    "we characterize the spatial distribution of galaxies in the lv mostly by studying the distribution of sizes of quasi - spherical regions - voids .",
    "the voids may still contain gas and small dark matter haloes . for our purpose void",
    "statistic is reasonably robust since 3d void maps are not very sensitive to a total number of objects in a sample .",
    "the distribution of void sizes have the advantage that they are sensitive to appearance of galaxies in very low density environments : an important property for studying the smallest existing galaxies .",
    "we compare the spectrum of void sizes in the lv with the distribution of voids in high - resolution cosmological simulations .",
    "the simulations give us detailed information ( positions , velocities , masses , circular velocities , and so on ) for dark matter haloes and their satellites .",
    "however , they do not provide luminosities of galaxies .",
    "theoretical predictions of the luminosity of a galaxy hosted by a halo with given mass , circular velocity and merging history are quite uncertain and can not be used for our analysis .",
    "instead , we ask a more simple question : what luminosity a halo or subhalo with given circular velocity _ should have _ in order to reproduce the observed spectrum of void sizes .",
    "when doing this , we assume that haloes with larger circular velocities should host more luminous galaxies .",
    "we will later see that matching of the void spectrum in simulations and with the observations puts significant constraint on relation of the halo circular velocity and the luminosity of a galaxy hosted by the halo .",
    "if we take too large circular velocity , there are too few galaxies and sizes of voids become too large . instead ,",
    "if very small haloes host galaxies , the number of large voids declines well below what is observed in the local volume .",
    "in addition to the analysis of distribution of voids in the local volume we also re - visit the problem of the deviations from the hubble flow .",
    "the flow of field galaxies in lv appeared to be rather `` cold '' : deviations from the hubble velocity are rather small .",
    "for example , using the tully - fisher distances and applying error correction via quadrature subtraction @xcite have found for 15 galaxies within 500  km / s and outside local group the rms peculiar velocity @xmath2760  km / s .",
    "they noted that such values are very rare in the cdm models , but are not uncommon in mdm models that include massive neutrinos .",
    "comparable values have been derived by @xcite for galaxies within 7  mpc from the local group . @xcite based on their galaxy sample obtained @xmath28km / s within 3mpc .",
    "@xcite found evidence of anisotropy of hubble flow in lv . there is a dipole component , which is due to the lg motion relative to galaxies in the lv .",
    "this is typically described as apex motion of the lv .",
    "there is also a quadrupole component of the deviations from the hubble flow interpreted as anisotropic expansion of local volume .",
    "@xcite removed the apex motion and the quadrupole component from estimates of @xmath11 .",
    "they also removed galaxies with large velocity deviations , which were considered due to infall of galaxies onto large groups inside the lv .",
    "galaxies inside groups were also not considered .",
    "using only the galaxies with accurate measurements of distances and assuming that errors in distances increase the rms peculiar velocities , @xcite estimate @xmath11 in distance range 1 - 3 mpc from the centre of lg may be as low as @xmath29 km / s .",
    "@xcite found @xmath30km / s inside a sphere of 5  mpc using distances from the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch stars of about 20 dwarf galaxies .",
    "their procedure of @xmath11 estimation include determination of the `` local '' hubble constant , which is slightly different from universal expansion rate : the true hubble constant .",
    "all these effects and corrections are valid , but they have a tendency to systematically underestimate the deviations from the hubble flow",
    ". some of the corrections can be mimiced in simulations , but it is difficult to do all of them .",
    "at the same time , one should not use these corrections : any deviation from the global hubble flow must be included in the estimates .",
    "we make only one exclusion .",
    "we still consider the apex motion because it is related with the selection of the reference frame in which the whole sample does not have a net velocity .",
    "there were several attempts to study @xmath11 in simulations .",
    "@xcite emphasized that the dispersion of random motions of field galaxies and the centres of groups allow to discriminate between models with different values of matter density @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite obtained in their constrained `` local supercluster '' simulation the peculiar line - of - sight velocity dispersion within @xmath32mpc of the model lg @xmath33km / sec comparable to the observed velocity dispersion of nearby galaxies .",
    "they emphasize that there is no need in exotic explanations of the `` coldness '' of hubble flow . @xcite",
    "have found that in their simulations the hubble flow is significantly colder around model lg - candidates selected in a @xmath14cdm cosmology than around lg - candidates in open or critical models .",
    "their estimation of @xmath11 was much simpler then @xcite approach  they calculate rms around mean value of peculiar velocity with local hubble constant ( best fit to data ) .    a key question for our kind of investigation is to define what an `` lv - candidate '' is .",
    "in other words , it is important to define our local environment .",
    "usually the conditions for selection of lg - candidates are rather simple and include distances of the lg - candidate to the nearest virgo - type cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the overdensity of a sphere of 8  mpc radius @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the overdensity 0.25 .",
    "@xcite used @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite noted that inside the radius of 8mpc centred on the local group the luminosity density in the b - band is 1.8  2 times larger than the average luminosity density .",
    "over the past few years searches for galaxies with distances less than 10mpc have been undertaken using numerous observational data including searches for lsb galaxies , blind hi surveys , and nir and hi observations of galaxies in the zone of avoidance @xcite . at present",
    ", the sample contains about 550 galaxies .",
    "the distances to the galaxies are not measured using the redshifts because the perturbations of the hubble flow in the local volume are large and significantly distort the spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "the distances are mostly measured with the tip of the red giant brunch ( trgb ) stars , cepheids , the tully - fisher relation , and some other secondary distance indicators . for most of galaxies",
    "the distances have been measured with the accuracy of 8 - 10% @xcite .",
    ".test of sample completeness : counts of galaxies with different absolute magnitudes @xmath35 in radial shells .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < \" , ]     . at smaller luminosities",
    "the theoretical curves are systematically above the observations . at @xmath1",
    "the disagreement is a factor of two in circular velocities implying a factor of @xmath17 disagreement in the number of haloes.,width=313 ]    we use an updated version of the @xcite sample of galaxies to study the distribution and motions of galaxies in the local volume .",
    "there are about 30 voids , which range in radius from 1mpc to 4mpc .",
    "we demonstrate that the spectrum of void sizes is relatively stable for variations of the sample and for uncertainties of distances to individual galaxies .",
    "estimates of the cosmic variance , which we get from cosmological simulations , also show stability of the void statistics .",
    "when making the theoretical predictions for the lcdm model , we carefully select local volume candidates . in many respects",
    "the candidates look very similar to the reality : they have similar number of large haloes , similar density contrasts at different scales , and have similar rms velocity deviations from the hubble flow .",
    "the spectrum of void sizes in simulations traces the observed spectrum remarkably well , if we assume that haloes with circular velocities @xmath7  km / s for @xmath36 and @xmath37  km / s for @xmath38 host galaxies brighter than @xmath1 .",
    "the mass limits are quite consistent with the theoretical expectations for the mass of smallest halo , which can host a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at the same time , if much smaller haloes with @xmath39  km / s host galaxies with the observed absolute magnitudes @xmath1 , voids in the lcdm model would be too small and their spectrum of sizes would strictly contradict the observations .",
    "this is hardly an unexpected conclusion : in the hierarchical scenario any void is filled with small haloes .",
    "the only question is what is the mass of the haloes . for the local volume with the completeness limit @xmath1",
    "this appears to be @xmath40  km / s .",
    "if this is true , haloes with @xmath41km / s should not host galaxies . _",
    "the problem is that in reality they do _ : in the local volume many luminous galaxies with these absolute magnitudes rotate with velocities @xmath42km / s or smaller .    in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we select all isolated galaxies with @xmath43 .",
    "the isolation criteria are very strict because we would like to be sure that the rotational velocities of galaxies were not reduced by stripping or by any other interaction with large neighboring galaxies .",
    "we select the galaxies , which are more than 1mpc away from any galaxy brighter than @xmath44 and do not have companions within 200  kpc , which are brighter than the galaxy itself .",
    "note that the galaxies are so small that the expected virial radius is smaller than 100kpc .",
    "all the galaxies are dwarf irregulars , and for half of them there are measurements of the 21 cm hi line width . using the hi full - width - half - maximum @xmath45 measurements , we estimate the rotational velocity of a galaxy : @xmath46 , were @xmath47 is the axial ratio .",
    "a large fraction of the hi line width is likely produced by random 810  km / s velocities .",
    "we do not subtract those because we compare the results with the circular velocities of dark matter haloes .",
    "table  4 presents the results for galaxies with detected hi emission and with @xmath48  km / s .",
    "galaxies in the table  4 have rotational velocities well below those required by the lcdm model .",
    "half of the galaxies rotate slower than 20  km / s .",
    "we also studied galaxies , which are not so isolated and galaxies , which are slightly brighter than those presented in the table  4 .",
    "results are qualitatively the same .",
    "the disagreement between the theory and observations also shows up in the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation for galaxies in the local volume . in order to construct the relation",
    ", we use all galaxies in the @xcite sample with measured hi line width @xmath45 , which have morphological type @xmath49 ( i.e. spirals and irregulars ) .",
    "the rotational velocities are corrected for inclinations . in order to allow the comparison with theory",
    ", we do not make any corrections for internal gas motions .",
    "open circles with error bars in figure  [ fig : tf ] show the tf relation of galaxies in the local volume .",
    "two lines in the plot also show the tf relation from @xcite and @xcite , which we extrapolate down to small magnitudes ( ghasp results extend down to @xmath50 ) .",
    "the observational tf estimates agree reasonably well for bright galaxies with @xmath51 . at smaller luminosities",
    "the lv results go slightly above the extrapolations from brighter samples .    when assigning luminosities to dark matter haloes we follow the prescription of @xcite . specifically , we rank by luminosity all the galaxies in the lv sample and we rank by circular velocity all the haloes in our lv - candidate samples in simulations .",
    "we then take the luminosity of the brightest galaxy and assign it to the halo with the largest circular velocity .",
    "then we take the second brightest galaxy and give its luminosity to the second halo and so on .",
    "according to @xcite , this prescription reproduces clustering properties of galaxies in the sdss sample .",
    "we add a small ( @xmath52 ) correction to the circular velocity of haloes to accommodate the effect of adiabatic contraction due to infall of baryons .",
    "figure  [ fig : tf ] shows that the lcdm model gives a good match to observations at the bright end of the luminosity function ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the model with lower normalization produces a better fit , but even the high normalization model can not be excluded : a more accurate treatment of the adiabatic infall may slightly improve the situation . at low luminosities the theory and observations gradually diverge , and at @xmath1 the differences are quite substantial : a factor of two in circular velocities .",
    "this is the same problem , which we found using the spectrum of voids : haloes with @xmath54  km / s should have luminosities @xmath1 in order to match the observational data .",
    "we would like to emphasize that _ the disagreement with the theory is staggering . _",
    "the observed spectrum of void sizes disagrees at many sigma level from the theoretical void spectrum if haloes with @xmath39km / s host galaxies brighter than @xmath1 .",
    "we can look at the situation from a different angle . in the lcdm model with @xmath55",
    "there are @xmath56 haloes with @xmath37km / s  the same number as the number of galaxies in the local volume with the @xmath1 limit . in the same volume in the lcdm model",
    "there are @xmath57 haloes with @xmath39km / s .",
    "if all these haloes host galaxies brighter than @xmath1 , the theory predicts a factor of ten more haloes as compared with the observations .",
    "the problem has the same roots as the overabundance of substructure in the local group : the lcdm model predicts too many dwarf dark matter ( sub)haloes as compared with the observed dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the solution of the problem of the overabundance of the dwarfs in the local volume may be similar to current explanations of the substructure problem in the lg :    * the observational sample is not complete : there are ten times more dwarf galaxies down to limiting magnitude @xmath1 than listed in the @xcite sample .",
    "the `` missed '' dwarfs are unlikely to be dwarf irregulars because they would have hi emission and would have been detected by blind hi surveys such as hipass @xcite .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies is a possibility .",
    "they do not have gas and can not be detected in hi .",
    "they have very low surface brightness , which makes it difficult to detect them on photographic plates .",
    "so , it is likely that many of the galaxies were missed .",
    "still , we do not know whether a large population of dsph galaxies exists in the lv .",
    "if this is so , we will have another problem : how to form thousands of dwarf spheroidals in very low density environments without any tidal stripping or interaction with massive parent galaxy .",
    "the slope of the luminosity function also will be much steeper : @xmath58 . * the observed galaxies with @xmath59km / s",
    "are hosted by significantly more massive haloes",
    ". the overabundance problem would be solved , if the circular velocity of a dark matter halo is @xmath60 .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the solution of the overabundance problem in the lg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) * most of the dwarf haloes with @xmath61km / s in local voids failed to form stars because they collapsed after the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the rms deviations from the hubble flow @xmath11 for galaxies at different distances from the local group and find that in most of our model lv - candidates the rms peculiar velocities are consistent with observational values : @xmath12km / s for distances less than 3mpc and @xmath13km / s for distances less than 8mpc . at the distances 4 ( 8) mpc",
    "the observed overdensities of galaxies are 3.5 - 5.5 ( 1.3 - 1.6 )  significantly larger than typically assumed .",
