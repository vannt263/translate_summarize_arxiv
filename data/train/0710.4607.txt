    "* section 5 ) used harris s theory to prove that the general problem of placing poles with static output feedback in linear systems theory was not solvable by radicals .",
    "he used numerical homotopy continuation to show that a particular galois group arising in pole placement was the full symmetric group ,  @xmath3 . underlying",
    "this calculation was a schubert problem .",
    "vakil  @xcite applied his geometric littlewood - richardson rule  @xcite to study galois groups of schubert problems and showed that many schubert problems have galois group containing the alternating group .",
    "a schubert problem is if it involves no more than two schubert conditions of codimension more than 1 .",
    "simple schubert problems are natural to study  @xcite and among all schubert problems on a given grassmannian , they have the largest intersection numbers , so they are the most challenging for direct computation .",
    "they may also be formulated as complete intersections , which is a restriction imposed by our software .",

    "we have computed galois groups of scores of other simple schubert problems , including one on the grassmannian of @xmath7-planes in @xmath0 having 8580 solutions and ones on grassmannians of @xmath4-planes in @xmath0 and in @xmath8 having 10329 and 17589 solutions , respectively . in every case , we find that the galois group is the full symmetric group . table  [ table : timings ] in section  [ sec : software ] records some of these calculations .",
    "based on this evidence , we conjecture that every simple schubert problem on a grassmannian has galois group equal to the full symmetric group .",

    "none of these examples can be studied with our software , which requires the schubert problem to have a formulation as a complete intersection .",
    "our software has two implementations in maple which use homotopy continuation to compute elements in the galois groups and either maple or gap  @xcite to determine if these elements generate the full symmetric group . for the continuation , both implementations use phcpack  @xcite through its maple interface phcmaple  @xcite and the second may also call bertini  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , numerical methods allow us to solve schubert problems with as many as 17589 solutions .",
    "these examples actually underestimate the gap between the computational possibilities of symbolic and numeric methods , because they were performed on serial machines .",
    "current and ( likely ) future increases in computer power will come from multiple core and distributed computing .",
    "this is a break with the past , when improvements in computational power came from increasing the clock speed of single - processor units .",
    "symbolic algorithms have limited potential in this regime , as grbner basis computation appears to be intrinsically serial and thus can not be efficiently parallelized .",
    "in contrast , numerical homotopy continuation is easily parallelized , since its atomic tasks are independent .",
    "thus methods based on numerical continuation will reap the benefits of future parallel architectures .",
    "in addition , numerical algorithms typically require less memory than symbolic algorithms . in particular , the sizes of final and intermediate expressions in grbner basis computation not only may be large , but also are unpredictable . for these reasons",

    "if we let @xmath214 be a 1-parameter family of @xmath205-planes with @xmath215 and @xmath216 , then we obtain a homotopy @xmath217       \\ = \\ \\dotsb \\ = \\      \\det\\ \\left[\\begin{matrix}e_{\\lambda,\\mu}\\\\g_{m-1}\\end{matrix}\\right]\\ = \\",

    "this method recursively finds solutions to parent problems given solutions to their child problems .",
    "the depth of this recursion equals the dimension of the skew schubert variety corresponding to the simple schubert problem we wish to solve , i.e. , the number of variables in the corresponding equations .",
    "the base case of this recursion is when @xmath218 , for then @xmath161 is empty unless @xmath219 for @xmath220 , and in that case , @xmath161 gives the @xmath19-plane spanned by @xmath221 .",
    "these homotopies are optimal .",
    "this is because they only follow solutions to the given schubert problem and because the number @xmath222 of solutions to a simple schubert problem satisfies the same recursion as the number of paths that are followed .",
    "namely , if @xmath218 then @xmath223 unless @xmath219 for @xmath224 , and then it equals 1 .",
    "if @xmath225 , then @xmath226    we do not quite use the homotopy we just described , as the equations involving @xmath76 will in general have degree in @xmath76 at least the minimum of @xmath19 and @xmath164 .",
    "instead , we use the convex combination of the equations @xmath227     \\ + \\ ( 1-t)\\det\\left[\\begin{matrix}e_{\\lambda,\\mu}\\\\g_\\mu\\end{matrix}\\right ]     \\ = \\ 0\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath228 has norm 1 , @xmath96 .",
    "this has degree 1 in the homotopy parameter @xmath76 .",
    "doing this , the intermediate solutions will not necessarily be solutions to the schubert problem , so we need to argue that this homotopy will remain optimal . for this , we appeal a little to the geometry of the grassmannian .",
    "the equations we use define hyperplane sections of the grassmannian in its plcker embedding , and the number of solutions @xmath222 to the schubert problem turns out to be the degree of the variety @xmath160 .",
    "thus , replacing a family of hyperplanes defined by schubert conditions ( as in the pieri homotopy ) by an arbitrary pencil of hyperplanes   will still give an optimal homotopy between solutions to the child problems and solutions to the parent problem .",
    "we divide the computation of the galois group of a schubert problem into three tasks .    1 .",
    "compute the solutions of a general instance of the problem , called a . 2 .",
    "use cheater homotopies to compute of the master set .",
    "3 .   determine the generated by the monodromy permutations .",
    "the first task may be accomplished by the brute - force application of a polynomial system solver .",
    "this is , however , inefficient . in table",
    "[ table : schub_kouch ] , we compare the number of solutions to simple schubert problems with @xmath229 to the number of homotopy paths followed in polyhedral homotopies ( as in the black - box solver of phcpack ) .",
    "this is the volume of the associated newton polytope and was computed with polymake  @xcite .",
    ".inefficiency of polyhedral homotopy for simple schubert problems [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     s : = seconds , m : = minutes , h : = hours    these reported times are not cpu times , but actual elapsed ( wall clock ) time , and so may exceed cpu time by 10 to 20 % .",
    "we also record the number of permutations we needed to compute .",
    "the entry in @xmath230 is the schubert problem @xmath231 and the entry in @xmath232 is the schubert problem @xmath233 .",
    "we ran some of these computations in bertini .",
    "it was unable to compute examples in more than 10 variables , and was markedly slower for the largest computations it completed , on @xmath234 , @xmath155 , and @xmath235 .",
    "on the other hand , bertini provided an independent verification that the galois groups were indeed the full symmetric groups .",
    "we remark that bertini is new software and its efficiency will likely improve .",
    "this paper demonstrates the feasibility of homotopy continuation as tool to study the galois groups of enumerative problems .",
    "it also implicitly provides several challenges to the numerical homotopy community .",
    "perhaps the most serious is the current lack of certifiability of computations in numerical homotopy software . while numerical methods will increasingly outperform symbolic algorithms in algebraic geometry , they are currently inferior in that their results do not come with certification .",
    "certificates for numerical computations do exist in theory , for example in shub and smale s  @xcite alpha - theory , and there is a need for their implementation .",
    "in fact , even more reliable numerical techniques , such as the interval step control proposed in @xcite , are sidestepped by homotopy continuation software developers mostly due to the perceived complexity of implementation and the expected slower performance in comparison with heuristic methods .",
    "robust , off - the - shelf software to handle polynomial systems that are not complete intersections is also needed to deal with ideals in algebraic geometry , which are typically not complete intersections .",
    "two further theoretical problems are not addressed in this paper . while the sampling of the fundamental group of the base space provided by the loop - generating heuristics of subsection [ subsec : loops ] is sufficient to generate the galois group in the examples we considered , a better understanding of the topology of a complement of an algebraic variety in a grassmannian is needed to prove that this sampling is always sufficient .",
    "second , we do not know how to certify that the computed set of permutations generates the whole galois group , if it is not the full symmetric group .",
    "the tools that we use could be applied more systematically to other problems in enumerative geometry . to this end",
    ", we plan a comprehensive project exploring the limit of computability of galois groups of schubert problems along several fronts .",
    "this will involve the software and algorithms described here  perhaps also incorporating hom4ps  @xcite .",
    "we will also write parallel software implementing algorithms to compute galois groups of schubert problems that are not compete intersections , as well as pushing the limits of the symbolic methods of billey and vakil  @xcite and of vakil s combinatorial algorithm  @xcite . this will be a large and distributed computation as in  @xcite which should give a catalog of the galois groups of several tens of thousands of schubert problems .",
