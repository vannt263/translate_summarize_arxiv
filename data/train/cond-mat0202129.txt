    "it has long been known that phase transitions are uncommon in one - dimensional classical statistical mechanics .",
    "an old argument by peierls shows that in models at non - zero temperature with local interactions and a finite number of degrees of freedom , order is not possible : the entropy gain from disordering the system will always dominate the energy loss .",
    "there are ( at least ) three ways of avoiding this argument .",
    "the first two are well understood . a system at zero temperature can of course order : the system just sits in its ground state .",
    "a system with long - range interactions can have an energy large enough to dominate the entropy . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss in depth a third way of obtaining a phase transition in one dimension .",
    "this is to study systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom per site .",
    "in particular , we will study magnets with @xmath4 and @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "we will see that there can be a phase transition in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "we solve these one - dimensional classical systems for any @xmath0 , and show how the transition occurs only in this limit ; for finite @xmath0 all quantities depend on the temperature analytically .",
    "the infinite number of degrees of freedom has roughly the same effect of increasing the effective dimensionality , but the phase transition is very different from those in higher dimension .",
    "it is not a phase transition between an ordered phase and a disordered one , but rather between a disordered phase and a seriously - disordered one . in the seriously - disordered phase",
    ", the system behaves as if it were at infinite temperature .",
    "the entropy has dominated the energy to the point where the energy term does not affect the physics ; each spin is effectively independent .",
    "the infinite number of degrees of freedom means that this serious disorder is possible even at finite temperature .",
    "the paper is a companion to one by tchernyshyov and sondhi @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that in some magnets , a mean - field calculation yields a phase transition in any dimension .",
    "since mean - field results are exact at @xmath5 , this predicts the phase transition we observe here .",
    "their computation also predicts that there is a first - order phase transition for the @xmath6 magnet on just three sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "remarkably , this first - order transition happens only for precisely three sites ; for any other number of sites greater than 1 there is a second - order transition .",
    "it has long been known that phase transitions can occur as @xmath5 in zero - dimensional matrix models @xcite .",
    "phase transitions in one dimension at infinite @xmath0 were studied in @xcite . in particular , the largest eigenvalue for the @xmath2 case discussed here was computed in @xcite for any @xmath0 . here",
    "will develop the necessary techniques systematically , and extend these results in several ways .",
    "we explicitly find all the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix for these magnets .",
    "all these results are completely analytic in @xmath0 and in the inverse temperature @xmath7 as long as @xmath0 is finite .",
    "the singularity and a phase transition can develop when @xmath5 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 remaining finite .",
    "knowing all the eigenvalues and their multiplicities explicitly for any @xmath0 lets us show that there can be a phase transition as @xmath5 even for a finite number of sites in one dimension .    in section 2",
    ", we find all the eigenvalues ( and their multiplicities ) of the transfer matrices in a variety of one - dimensional magnets . in section 3",
    ", we use these results to study the phase transitions which occur as the number of sites and @xmath0 go to infinity .",
    "most of these phase transitions are ferromagnetic , but one is antiferromagnetic . in section 4 ,",
    "we study the first - order transition for the three - site @xmath2 chain . in an appendix",
    "we collect some useful mathematical results .",
    "to illustrate the procedure , we start with a simple rotor , the classical xy model in one dimension . the spin is defined by a periodic variable @xmath10 , and spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 on adjacent sites have energy @xmath13 to compute the partition function of this system , define a transfer `` matrix '' @xmath14 since the variables of the system take continuous values , this is nt really a matrix , but rather the kernel of an integral operator .",
    "it takes functions of @xmath11 to functions of @xmath12 by @xmath15 to compute the partition function , we need eigenvalues @xmath16 of @xmath17 . because the spins take values on a compact space ( the circle here ) , the eigenvalues are discrete and hence labeled by a discrete index @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath19 obey @xmath20 for the energy ( [ eo(2 ) ] ) , the @xmath19 are obviously @xmath21 the index @xmath18 must be an integer to preserve the periodicity under @xmath22 . to see that these are eigenfunctions , note that @xmath23 the integral then can be evaluated for any @xmath18 in terms of a bessel function : @xmath24 the partition function for @xmath25 sites with periodic boundary conditions is then @xmath26 when @xmath25 is large enough , the sum is dominated by largest eigenvalue , which here is the @xmath27 state .",
    "the internal energy density @xmath28 of the system is then @xmath29 all other quantities such as correlators can easily be found as well , since we have an explicit and complete set of eigenvalues and their multiplicities .",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath31 problem are found by fourier transforming the transfer matrix .",
    "what we need to do for more general cases can be summarized as fourier analysis on manifolds more general than the circle .",
    "in other words , we want to expand a function taking values on a manifold @xmath32 into a series , e.g. @xmath33 where the @xmath34 are complete set of orthonormal functions .",
    "the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are the coefficients of the expansion in this basis .",
    "the problem of fourier analysis on all the manifolds of interest has been solved already .",
    "the key is to exploit the symmetry .",
    "a familiar example is where the spins take values on the two - sphere @xmath35 , where the eigenfunctions are called spherical harmonics . in coset language , the two - sphere can be described as the manifold @xmath36 : the @xmath37 group consists of rotations , while the @xmath31 subgroup is the set of rotations which leave a given point invariant .",
    "thus different points on @xmath35 take values in @xmath38 .",
    "we parameterize the two - sphere by the usual spherical coordinates : a unit three - vector @xmath39 . to make progress , it is crucial to consider an energy invariant under the @xmath37 rotation group , namely @xmath40 we can expand the transfer matrix energy into irreducible representations of the rotation group , labeled by an angular momentum @xmath18 and an @xmath41 component @xmath42 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the transfer matrix are expressed in terms of legendre polynomials @xmath43 , whose explicit definition will be given below .",
    "one way of showing that the legendre polynomials are eigenfunctions of the transfer matrix is to show that they obey an addition theorem , for example @xmath44 where the @xmath45 are called associated legendre polynomials , with @xmath46 .",
    "one can then expand the function @xmath47 in terms of legendre polynomials , and then use the addition theorem to split the @xmath11 and @xmath12 dependence .",
    "this leaves an integral for the eigenvalue .    to just obtain the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix",
    ", one does not have to go to all the complications of generalized addition theorems .",
    "mathematicians have developed more in - depth ways of deriving the eigenfunctions , and then the addition theorem comes as a consequence of the computation .",
    "a geometric method is discussed in @xcite , while a much more explicit method is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will require the methods of the latter in order to treat the @xmath3 magnet , where the spins do not take values on a symmetric space .",
    "( a symmetric space @xmath48 has @xmath49 a maximal subgroup of @xmath50 ; the importance here is that when the spins take values in a symmetric space , the transfer matrix depends on only one parameter . )",
    "first we find the eigenvalues for an @xmath30-invariant magnet , where the spins @xmath51 take values on the manifold @xmath52 , which is the @xmath53-sphere @xmath54 .",
    "we take the energy between nearest neighbors to be @xmath55 an eigenvalue @xmath16 associated with eigenfunction @xmath56 is given by the equation @xmath57",

    "the unit @xmath0-vector @xmath51 depends on @xmath59 angles , but the energy only depends on the angle between the two spins .",
    "this means that to compute the eigenvalue , we need do only one integral . put in terms of the @xmath37 spherical harmonics , it means that the eigenvalues depend only the value of @xmath18 and not @xmath42 .",
    "explicitly , if one sets @xmath61 , the integrand in ( [ evon ] ) depends on only a single angle @xmath11 .",
    "we can then do the integral over all the other angles in ( [ evon ] ) , and the measure reduces to @xcite @xmath62 = \\frac{\\gamma(n/2)}{\\gamma((n-1)/2)\\gamma(1/2 ) } \\int_0^\\pi d\\theta \\sin^{n-2}\\theta \\label{measure}\\ ] ]    the eigenfunctions for all the magnets we study here can be written in terms of jacobi polynomials @xmath63 .",
    "these are orthogonal polynomials of order @xmath64 , and a number of useful properties are collected in the appendix .",
    "the eigenfunctions for the @xmath30 magnet with energy ( [ energyon ] ) are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 . these are often called gegenbauer or ultraspherical polynomials .",
    "they are indeed orthogonal with respect to the measure ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues are then given by @xmath67 using the integral in the appendix for @xmath68 gives @xmath69 the function @xmath70 is called kummer s function , and is a confluent hypergeometric function . its definition and",
    "the differential equation it satisfies are given in the appendix .",
    "using the double - argument formula for gamma functions @xcite and the identity ( [ besselm ] ) with @xmath71 gives our result @xmath72    note that the eigenvalues reduce to the rotor result ( [ evo2 ] ) when @xmath73 .",
    "note also that @xmath30 ferromagnets and antiferromagnets are essentially the same , because redefining @xmath74 for every other spin sends @xmath75 .",
    "this transformation @xmath76 leaves the measure of the integral invariant , and @xmath77 .    as a function of @xmath7 ,",
    "the bessel function is analytic for all @xmath7 .",
    "moreover @xmath78 for any @xmath7 as long as @xmath79 is positive .",
    "thus the free energy does not have any singularities as long as @xmath79 remains finite .",
    "one might hope something interesting happens when @xmath5 , but in section [ section : infinite - n ] we will show that in this case there is still no transition .",
    "the computation for the @xmath2 case is very similar to that of the @xmath30 case , but we will see in the next section how there is a completely new phase .    the @xmath2 magnet is defined in terms of a complex @xmath0-vector @xmath80 obeying @xmath81 .",
    "the energy for adjacent sites is @xmath82 this energy is not only invariant under global @xmath2 rotations , but is invariant under local ( gauge ) transformations @xmath83 at any site @xmath84 .",
    "the vector @xmath80 takes values on a complex sphere @xmath85 , which as a manifold is identical to the real @xmath86-sphere @xmath87 .",
    "however , the @xmath88 gauge symmetry can be used to effectively reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the problem by 1 .",
    "for example , one can set the last component of @xmath80 to be real at every site , so @xmath80 effectively takes values on the manifold @xmath89 this manifold is a symmetric space , and is known as the complex projective space @xmath90 .",
    "like the @xmath30 case , the energy between adjacent sites depends only on a single angle @xmath11 , where @xmath91 ( any phase can always be gauged away ) .",
    "then the normalized measure can be written as @xcite @xmath92 = 2(n-1 ) \\int_0^{\\pi/2 } d\\theta \\sin^{2n-3}\\theta \\cos\\theta   \\label{unmeasure}\\ ] ] the eigenvectors of the @xmath90 transfer matrix are jacobi polynomials as well , namely @xcite @xmath93 the @xmath73 case reduces to the ordinary real two - sphere , and indeed the @xmath94 are ordinary spherical harmonics .",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry means that the eigenvalues have degeneracies .",
    "for example , we saw in section 2.1 that for @xmath73 the eigenvalue depends only on @xmath18 and not the @xmath95 value @xmath42 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the degeneracy @xmath96 of @xmath16 is of course @xmath97 ; the generalization to all @xmath0 is @xcite @xmath98 the eigenvalues are given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "using the integral in the appendix for @xmath101 , @xmath102 gives @xmath103 for finite @xmath0 and @xmath7 , these are analytic functions .",
    "note that , unlike for @xmath30 magnets , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are not equivalent here . for positive @xmath7",
    ", we have a ferromagnet : the energy favors aligned spins : a neighbor of @xmath106 is in the same state @xmath107 ( up to a phase ) .",
    "however , @xmath105 does not correspond to an antiferromagnet : the energy favors the neighbor @xmath108 being in _ any _ state orthogonal to @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "there is a unique orthogonal state only for @xmath73 .",
    "thus , with the exception of @xmath111 , the @xmath2 model ( [ esun ] ) is ferromagnetic when @xmath104 , but is not an antiferromagnet when @xmath105 . for a proper generalization of an antiferromaget",
    ", one needs to designate among the @xmath59 vectors orthogonal to @xmath112 one that can be called `` antiparallel '' to it , for example , @xmath113 . doing so manifestly breaks the @xmath2 symmetry , as we discuss next .",
    "the @xmath114 magnet can be deformed in an interesting way by breaking the @xmath114 symmetry to @xmath3 .",
    "the main novelty of this @xmath3 magnet is that the phase transition can occur at an antiferromagnetic value of @xmath7 .",
    "the energy between adjacent sites is @xmath115 where @xmath109 is a @xmath116-dimensional complex vector , and @xmath117 is the @xmath118 dimensional matrix @xmath119 , where i is the @xmath0-dimensional identity matrix , and @xmath120 the pauli matrix .",
    "the second term breaks the @xmath114 symmetry , but preserves an @xmath3 subgroup . the case @xmath121 reduces to the @xmath114 ferromagnet discussed above .",
    "the case @xmath122 , studied by read and sachdev @xcite , is a large-@xmath0 generalization of an antiferromagnet .",
    "indeed , the energy @xmath123 is minimized when vectors @xmath109 and @xmath108 are locked in adjacent flavors @xmath124 and @xmath125 , e.g. , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , analogues of spin - down @xmath126 and spin - up @xmath127 in @xmath111 .",
    "like the @xmath2 magnet , the generalized model has a local @xmath88 symmetry .",
    "just like the complex sphere @xmath85 is identical as a manifold to the real sphere @xmath87 , the `` quaternionic sphere '' @xmath128 is identical as a manifold to the complex sphere @xmath129 ( which in turn is equivalent the real @xmath130-sphere @xmath131 ) .",
    "when we fix a gauge , then @xmath109 takes values on the manifold @xmath132",
    "it is easiest to study first the special point @xmath133 , where the gauge symmetry is enhanced to @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath111 gauge symmetry ( a subgroup of the @xmath135 ) mixes the @xmath124 and @xmath125 components of @xmath109 and also mixes @xmath109 and @xmath136 . precisely ,",
    "if we arrange these components into the matrix @xmath137 then all the @xmath138 transform under the gauge symmetry as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is an element of @xmath111 .",
    "the energy is invariant under these transformations even though @xmath140 can be different at every point .",
    "if we use this symmetry to fix a gauge ( e.g.@xmath141 , @xmath142 ) , then @xmath109 for @xmath133 takes values on the manifold @xmath143 which we call @xmath144 .",
    "solving this case is almost the same as the @xmath2 case , because this is a symmetric space .",
    "the energy between adjacent sites depends on only one variable , and the measure becomes @xcite @xmath145 = 4(n-1)(2n-1 ) \\int_0^{\\pi/2 } d\\theta \\sin^{4n-5}\\theta \\cos^3\\theta \\label{spnmeasure}\\ ] ] the eigenfunctions of the transfer matrix are the jacobi polynomials @xmath146 @xcite . using the integral in the appendix yields @xmath147 for @xmath73 ,",
    "this is equivalent to the @xmath148 magnet .",
    "the calculation for @xmath149 is more complicated .",
    "the reason is that the energy between adjacent sites depends now on two angles : the manifold ( [ spnmanifold ] ) is not a symmetric space .",
    "luckily , the work of @xcite allows us to solve this case as well .",
    "it is convenient to write coordinates for the quaternionic sphere @xmath128 in terms of angles @xmath150 describing an ordinary @xmath59-dimensional sphere , namely @xmath151 then we have @xmath152 the angles take values in @xmath153 setting @xmath154 corresponds to all coordinates @xmath155 except @xmath156 .",
    "then the energy ( [ espn ] ) is @xmath157 this indeed depends on two angles , except in the @xmath111 gauge - invariant case @xmath133 . in terms of these two variables ,",
    "the measure is @xmath158 = 8(n-1)(2n-1 ) \\int_0^{\\pi/2 } d\\theta \\sin^{4n-5}\\theta \\cos^3\\theta \\int_0^{\\pi/2 } d\\omega \\sin\\omega \\cos\\omega \\label{spnmeasure2}\\ ] ] where we have dropped the now - unnecessary subscripts and primes .",
    "the eigenvectors of the corresponding transfer matrix are now labelled by two indices , @xmath159 .",
    "they are written in terms of jacobi polynomials as @xcite @xmath160 one can easily check that they are indeed orthogonal with respect to the measure ( [ spnmeasure2 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath161 of the transfer matrix in the read - sachdev case @xmath122 , @xmath162 are therefore given by @xmath163 using the integral in the appendix twice , we find that @xmath164 where @xmath165 this series be rewritten in terms of a confluent hypergeometric function if desired . for the ground state @xmath166 , it simplifies to @xmath167 the lowest eigenvalue is identical to that for the @xmath114 magnet , but the general eigenvalues are not the same .",
    "in this section we study systems with the number of sites @xmath168 .",
    "this means that the free energy follows from the largest eigenvalue @xmath169 of the transfer matrix .",
    "we saw in the last section that in all cases , @xmath169 is analytic function of the inverse temperature @xmath7 for any finite @xmath0 .",
    "thus the only possibility for a phase transition is if this function develops a singularity as @xmath5 .",
    "it is useful to study the @xmath30 magnets first .",
    "we need to use the asymptotic formula for bessel functions , valid when @xmath79 is large @xcite : @xmath170 where @xmath171 this formula implies that to have a non - trivial large @xmath0 limit , we need to take the inverse temperature @xmath7 to @xmath172 as well , leaving the model in terms of the new variable @xmath173 . using this formula and",
    "some algebra gives the eigenvalue ratios to be @xmath174 when we write quantities as a function of @xmath175 , we mean that the expression is valid up to terms of order @xmath176 .",
    "the two - point function is @xmath177 so @xmath178 is indeed the correlation length . at zero temperature ( @xmath179 ) ,",
    "@xmath178 diverges , just like the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "this is the usual zero - temperature behavior in one - dimensional classical models .",
    "the correlation length does not diverge for any other value of temperature , but note that at infinite temperature , @xmath180 .",
    "this is a state where the system is completely disordered : every site is essentially independent of any other site , because all configurations have the same weight in the partition sum .",
    "it is also useful to compute the internal energy .",
    "this is defined as @xmath181 using the asymptotic formula for the bessel function gives @xmath182 in the @xmath5 limit , the internal energy is proportional to @xmath0 , so it is the energy per component which remains finite .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnets each have a phase transition when @xmath5 .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue is given by for example @xmath183 as detailed in the last section , for the read - sachdev case @xmath184 . to find the large @xmath0 behavior , it is useful to examine the differential equation ( [ diffeq ] ) for @xmath185 directly",
    ". then one can see how one can neglect various terms in the equation in various regimes , and then easily solve the equation .",
    "this sort of analysis is called boundary - layer theory , and the techniques are discussed at length in @xcite . rewriting ( [ diffeq ] ) in terms of @xmath186",
    ", one has @xmath187 in the large @xmath0 limit , we can neglect the first term as long as @xmath188 .",
    "this shows that @xmath189 this formula can be verified by using stirling s formula in the series expression ( [ kummer ] ) for @xmath70 .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue at large @xmath0 is therefore @xmath190 two important results are apparent from this formula .",
    "first , there is a singularity at @xmath191 .",
    "second , @xmath192 for @xmath188 does not grow with @xmath0 , and so the internal energy per component vanishes .",
    "a vanishing internal energy is characteristic of infinite temperature .",
    "the remarkable characteristic of the @xmath2 magnet is that this behavior persists all the way from infinite temperature @xmath193 to a finite temperature @xmath191 .",
    "in fact , the correlation length vanishes for all @xmath188 .",
    "this follows from the ratio of the first two eigenvalues : @xmath194 as @xmath5 , this vanishes if @xmath188 .",
    "most scale - invariant critical points have diverging correlation length . at the phase transition at @xmath191 , the correlation length _",
    "vanishes_. we call a phase with vanishing correlation length _ seriously disordered_. this distinguishes it from the @xmath195 phase , which is a conventional disordered phase with a finite , non - zero correlation length . in the seriously - disordered phase ,",
    "the eigenfunction is @xmath196 .",
    "this eigenfunction gives equal probabilities to all configurations .",
    "basically , what has happened is that the energy has been swamped by the entropy . for large @xmath0",
    ", there are so many possible spin configurations that if @xmath188 , the energy term is too small to make a difference .",
    "this is apparent in the integral ( [ unevint ] ) .",
    "the measure favors configurations where the angle @xmath11 between nearest - neighbor spins is near @xmath197 .",
    "the reason is as stated before : for a fixed @xmath80 , there is only one value of @xmath198 where @xmath199 but there are many with @xmath200 .",
    "the energy favors aligned spins , and at @xmath191 the energy term is strong enough to cause a transition to a phase with finite correlation length . the phase for @xmath195 is still a disordered phase , but a conventional one , as occurs in the @xmath30 magnets . note that this phase transition occurs in the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath104 ) . if @xmath105 , the energy and the entropy both favor disorder , so the system is always seriously disordered .    we have asserted but not yet proven that for @xmath195",
    ", the internal energy is non - zero and the correlation length is finite .",
    "the expression ( [ mlim ] ) for @xmath70 in the large-@xmath0 limit is not valid for @xmath195 , because the first term in the differential equation ( [ diffeqy ] ) can no longer be neglected when @xmath201 is of order @xmath202 .",
    "to understand @xmath195 , it is useful to derive a differential equation for @xmath203 directly .",
    "one has @xmath204 where we utilized ( [ diffeqy ] ) .",
    "the internal energy for @xmath188 is a solution of this equation with @xmath28 finite , found by neglecting the left - hand side and the last term on the right - hand side .",
    "it is @xmath205 the solution of the differential equation ( [ diffequ ] ) for @xmath0 large and @xmath195 comes by assuming @xmath206 is finite .",
    "then one neglects the left - hand - side and the second term on the right - hand side , yielding @xmath207 one can find the @xmath176 corrections to these expressions systematically .",
    "for example , one can show that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath169 for @xmath195 is to next order in @xmath0 : @xmath208 where @xmath209 .",
    "the ratio of the first two eigenvalues for @xmath195 follows from a similar computation , yielding @xmath210 thus we see that the correlation length indeed goes to zero as @xmath211 from above .",
    "this is a second - order phase transition : the energy is continuous but its derivative is discontinuous . for the read - sachdev @xmath3 magnets ,",
    "the formula is similar : @xmath212      the expression for the eigenvalues in terms of the kummer function @xmath70 is valid for any value of @xmath175 and @xmath0 , but the expressions derived for the large-@xmath0 limit break down when @xmath213 is of order @xmath214 .",
    "all the terms in the differential equations ( [ diffeqy],[diffequ ] ) need to be included in this region .",
    "to understand the transition region , we study the physics in terms of the variable @xmath215 the differential equation for the lowest eigenvalue ( [ diffeqy ] ) becomes ( in the @xmath2 case ) @xmath216 for @xmath0 large , we can neglect the term with the @xmath202 in it . thus the subsequent analysis will be valid up to terms of order @xmath202 , as opposed to equations in the last section , which have corrections of order @xmath176 . solving this differential equation by plugging in the series @xmath217",
    "requires that @xmath218 plugging this in and summing the series , the solution near @xmath219 for large @xmath0 is therefore @xmath220 where the @xmath70 is indeed our friend the kummer function .",
    "thus we have shown that the eigenvalue @xmath221 near @xmath219 at large @xmath0 is related to a kummer function with different arguments .",
    "to fix the values of @xmath222 and @xmath223 , we need to match this onto the value of @xmath169 in the high - temperature phase ( [ evsunhigh ] ) and in the low - temperature phase ( [ evsunlow ] ) . from @xcite",
    ", we have the asymptotic formula @xmath224 matching while neglecting terms of order @xmath202 yields @xmath225 .",
    "matching this with the numerical result for @xmath226 given in the last section gives @xmath227 the two terms in ( [ lam0 ] ) cancel when @xmath84 is large and negative , but add when @xmath84 is large and positive .    with a little work",

    "this means that we can also study phase transitions where the number of sites @xmath25 is finite as well as the infinite-@xmath25 case studied in section 3 .",
    "the phase transition persists all the way down to two sites .",
    "a remarkable result of the mean - field - theory analysis of @xcite is that for three sites ( and only for three sites ) , the transition becomes first - order .",
    "we verify this result in this section .",
    "the partition function for the @xmath2 magnet with periodic boundary conditions for any number of sites @xmath25 is given by @xmath233 where the eigenvalues @xmath16 and their degeneracies @xmath96 are given by ( [ unev ] ) and ( [ degeneracy ] ) respectively . in this section",
    "we study only the @xmath2 magnet , so we will omit the @xmath2 superscripts . if one takes @xmath168 before taking @xmath5 , the partition function is dominated by the largest eigenvalue @xmath169 no matter what the degeneracy @xmath96 is .",
    "however , for finite @xmath25 , the fact that @xmath96 grows quite quickly with @xmath18 and @xmath0 means that the largest eigenvalue does not necessarily dominate the partition function , but instead @xmath234 for some @xmath235 which may not be zero .",
    "all the eigenvalues with finite @xmath18 ( so that @xmath236 as @xmath5 ) have the same kind of singularity as @xmath237 .",
    "thus if the effect of including the degeneracy merely shifts @xmath235 to some finite value , the second - order transition remains . to find a first - order transition",
    ", we need to study the eigenvalues when @xmath5 with @xmath238 remaining finite .",
    "it is convenient to fix the inverse temperature @xmath175 and study the problem as a function of @xmath239 , defined as @xmath240 at some value @xmath241 , @xmath242 is a maximum ; at this value the free energy is minimized ( the path integral has a saddle point ) .",
    "the behavior of the eigenvalues at non - zero @xmath239 can be found by doing a saddle - point approximation to the integral representation of the kummer function , or by deriving a differential equation for @xmath243 in the manner of ( [ diffequ ] ) . to leading order in @xmath0 , @xmath244 where @xmath245 at large @xmath0 and @xmath18",
    ", the degeneracy behaves as @xmath246 the degeneracy is a group - theoretical factor and is independent of the inverse temperature @xmath175 .",
    "a first - order transition occurs if @xmath247 jumps discontinuously as @xmath175 is varied .",
    "what can happen is that @xmath242 can develop another maximum as a function of @xmath239 . at some value @xmath248",
    ", one can have two peaks at the same place : @xmath249_{r = r_1 }   & = & \\frac{d}{dr } \\left[d(r)\\lambda(r , y_0)^l\\right]_{r = r_2}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if this happens , the free energy has two minima as a function of @xmath239 .",
    "this is the mark of a first - order transition : the internal energy will not be continuous in @xmath175 because the value of @xmath247 jumps from @xmath250 to @xmath251 as @xmath175 is varied .",
    "we find that for @xmath252 , this indeed happens . in fig .",
    "[ fig : free - energy ] , we plot the free energy per site @xmath253}/(3y)$ ] for values of @xmath175 just below , above , and at the transitional value @xmath254 . at the phase transition , the value of @xmath247 jumps from @xmath255 to @xmath256 .",
    "this is small , but the transition is definitely first order , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs for @xmath188 , so the internal energy jumps from @xmath255 to a finite value .",
    "no transition occurs at @xmath191 , because the saddle point is already away from @xmath257 .    for any other value of @xmath25 ,",
    "the transition is second - order as before ; no second minimum seems to occur . due to the unwieldiness of the expression ( [ lamr ] ) , we have not been able to prove this in general , but it is easy to see by looking at the curves numerically . since the first - order transition is so weak for three sites , it would indeed be surprising if the effect of the degeneracies were to overcome the behavior of the eigenvalues for larger @xmath25 . to see this in more detail ,",
    "let us examine some limits . at large @xmath239",
    ", the eigenvalue goes to zero as @xmath258 , while the degeneracy only grows as @xmath259 .",
    "thus @xmath247 must be finite .",
    "the behavior for small @xmath239 crucially depends on whether @xmath175 is greater or less than @xmath260 . for @xmath188 , @xmath261 , and",
    "the slope at @xmath257 is negative . for @xmath195 ,",
    "@xmath262 depends on @xmath175 and the slope at @xmath257 is positive .",
    "the simplest behavior for @xmath188 consistent with these limits is to have @xmath263 fall off monotonically from @xmath260 to zero .",
    "the simplest behavior for @xmath195 is for @xmath263 to rise up to a single maximum at some value @xmath241 , and then fall off to zero for large @xmath239 . by studying plots of the free energy , it seems that this simple scenario is realized for all @xmath25 larger than @xmath264 . for @xmath265 and @xmath188 , @xmath266 , so the partition function is dominated by an eigenvalue with finite @xmath18 . as @xmath175",
    "is increased past @xmath260 , @xmath247 becomes non - zero .",
    "there is only a single peak , so @xmath247 varies continuously with @xmath175 , so the minimum value of the free energy is also varies continuously .",
    "this means that for @xmath265 the only phase transition is a second - order one at @xmath191 .",
