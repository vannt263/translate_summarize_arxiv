    "<S> we have calculated spin relaxation rates in parabolic quantum dots due to the phonon modulation of the spin - orbit interaction in presence of an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> both , deformation potential and piezoelectric electron - phonon coupling mechanisms are included within the pavlov - firsov spin - phonon hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> our results have demonstrated that , in narrow gap materials , the electron - phonon deformation potential and piezoelectric coupling give comparable contributions as spin relaxation processes . for large dots , </S>",
    "<S> the deformation potential interaction becomes dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is not observed in wide or intermediate gap semiconductors , where the piezoelectric coupling , in general , governs the spin relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> we also have demonstrated that spin relaxation rates are particularly sensitive to the land @xmath0-factor .    ,    ,    quantum dots , spin dephasing 73.20.dx , 63.20.kr , 71.38.+i    the ability to manipulate and control processes that involve transitions between spin states is , at the moment , of extreme importance due to the recent applications in quantum computation and quantum communication . </S>",
    "<S> quantum dots ( qd s ) of diverse geometries are good candidates for implementation of semiconductor quantum communication devices because the electronic , magnetic and optical properties can be controlled in the modern grown and nanofabrication techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the spin dephasing time is important because it sets the length - scale on which coherent physics can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to understand the origin of decoherence so that ultimately it may be reduced or controlled . at the moment </S>",
    "<S> remains in discussion which , between these processes , is dominant in semiconductors in low dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> some experimental results have shown good agreement with the theoretical predictions in 2-d systems  @xcite but , in general , the identification of the processes through direct comparison with the experimental results can become a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is more critical in qd s , since few experimental results exist and the theoretical discussion of the spin relaxation mechanisms is still an open subject . </S>",
    "<S> khaetskii and nazarov  @xcite studied two kind of processes of spin relaxation induced by phonons in gaas qd s : i ) the first mechanism is due to the dresselhaus admixture of states with an opposite spin . without the spin - orbit interaction the zeeman sublevels correspond to the orbital state with  pure \" spin states . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of spin - orbit terms provides a small admixture of the states with opposite spin to each sublevel and , thus , enables the phonon - assistant transition between them ; ii ) the second process is related with the direct coupling between the spin and the strain field as produced by the acoustic phonons . with admixture process ( i ) , scattering rates of the order of @xmath1 s@xmath2 were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the authors also showed that the admixture process is the dominant one . </S>",
    "<S> recently , woods _ </S>",
    "<S> et al , _  @xcite have studied spin relaxation considering the coupling between spins and phonons arising from interface motion . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism arises when interface motion due to acoustic phonons changes a parameter of the system . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> small ( @xmath3 s@xmath2 ) and strongly size dependent relaxation rates have been found by the authors . in these works , the spatial dependence of the @xmath0-factor was not considered . </S>",
    "<S> also , due to the small transition energies , only the coupling by piezo - phonons were included in the rate calculation . </S>",
    "<S> these approximations are not necessarily valid for inas qd s , since : i ) experimental measurements have shown that the electron @xmath0-factor depends strongly on the dot size  @xcite , ii ) in inas based qd s , the zeeman transition energies can be considerably larger than for gaas qd s and , therefore , the coupling due to the deformation potential can contribute significantly to the relaxation rates .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the model of pavlov and firsovpavlov66,pavlov67 . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian describing the transitions with spin reversal , in the scattering of electrons by phonons , can be written in a general form , @xmath4 \\cdot \\left ( \\mathbf{p}+\\frac{e}{% c}\\mathbf{a}\\right ) $ ] , where @xmath5 is the phonon operator , @xmath6 is the spin operator , @xmath7 is the momentum operator and @xmath8 is the vector potential for the magnetic field @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction hamiltonian depends on spin variables and , thus , can lead to spin - flip transitions between pure spin states . in this work we have calculated spin relaxation rates in inas parabolic quantum dots , considering the phonon modulation of the spin - orbit interaction within the pavlov - firsov model . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effects of the spatial dependence of the electron @xmath0-factor and evaluate the contributions of the deformation potential and piezoelectric couplings on the spin relaxation rates .    </S>",

    "<S> the calculations were performed at @xmath54  k and we only have considered transitions between ground state zeeman levels . the temperature dependence for one - phonon emission rate is determined from @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the bose distribution function and @xmath57 is the rate at @xmath58  k. in the temperature regime @xmath5910  k and considering typical values of magnetic field @xmath60 , the bose function is @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for temperatures larger than few kelvin degrees , two - phonon processes should be considered as the dominant spin relaxation mechanism . these type of processes have not been considered in the present calculation .    in general , we obtain that @xmath63 , @xmath64 being an integer number that depends on the electron - phonon coupling process ( @xmath64 = 7 for deformation potential and @xmath64 = 5 for piezoelectric coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> this strong dependence with the transition energy and , in consequence with the @xmath0-factor , demands that this parameter should be determined taking in account the effects of the quantum confinement . </S>",
    "<S> spin splitting measurements in inas self - assembled qd s  @xcite have revealed @xmath0-factors showing clear dependence on the dot size . </S>",
    "<S> values in the range of 0.8 - 1.29 were reported for qd s in strong confinement regime and they differ strongly from the value of bulk inas ( @xmath65= - 14.4 ) . in order to include the spatial dependence of the @xmath0-factor in the rate calculation we have used the roth formula given in eq . </S>",

    "<S> our results show that the effect of confinement on the @xmath0-factor produces significant variations in the relaxation rates . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ factorg ] ) for deformation potential mechanism , @xmath13 = 1  t and @xmath66 = 5  nm .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the rates with the qd size depends directly on the spatial overlap integral and the magnitude and on the sign of the @xmath0-factor . for negative values of @xmath0 , the rate diminishes as the dot size </S>",

    "<S> this behavior can be illustrated in the rates calculated with @xmath69 ( dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] ) . the eq.(factorg ) provides positive values of @xmath0 for @xmath70 nm , in this case the rate increases as the dot size increases ( solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> figure1 ) . the @xmath0-factor dependence on size can be neglected in the relaxation rates , for dots with @xmath71  nm , since the energy of zeeman level becomes very small .    </S>",
    "<S> according with the general relation , @xmath72 , we can also observe that the rates will depend strongly on the magnetic field and can increases several order of magnitude when values of @xmath13 are swept from 0.5  t to @xmath73  t. our results demonstrate that for narrow - gap materials , the piezoelectric [ fig .  [ figure1]a ) ] and deformation potential [ fig .  [ figure1]b ) ] coupling present comparable contribution to the spin relaxation process . indeed , for large dots and large magnetic fields , the deformation potential interaction becomes the dominant one . </S>",
    "<S> this result is not observed in gaas ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) , where the pe coupling , in general , governs the relaxation process .    </S>",
    "<S> for gaas case , the confinement does not produce important modifications in the @xmath0-factor and the scattering rates shown in the fig .  </S>",

    "<S> nm , the relaxation times can be as large as seconds and the rates become almost independent of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior as well as the magnitude of rates are similar to those obtained by woods  @xcite when considered other relaxation mechanisms mediated by acoustic phonons .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the spin relaxation of electrons in inas and gaas parabolic quantum dots by considering the phonon modulation induced on the spin - orbit interaction as the relaxation process . for dots based on narrow - gap materials </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the size dependence ( spatial localization ) of the @xmath0-factor can not be neglected in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> also , the deformation potential mechanism can become dominant , especially for large @xmath13 . </S>"
