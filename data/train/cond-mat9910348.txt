    "the most significant development in electronic devices has been the progressive miniaturization of them : it is now common to fabricate electron device structures with dimensions at mesoscopic scale and even at nanoscale .",
    "one of the important directions in nanoelectronics research is to understand device properties which relate to the existence of small dimensions . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the notion of electrochemical capacitance for conductors in the mesoscopic or nanoscale and the nonequilibrium charge distribution at the nonlinear level . using a full first principles quantum theory , a semiclassical theory , as well as a direct numerical solution",
    ", we construct an overall physical picture on the effects of quantum tunneling to the nanoscale capacitance .",
    "we also investigate the density of state correction to capacitance at nonlinear orders of the external bias . for a pair of very small conductors",
    ", it has been known that the capacitance may be quite different from the usual parallel plate capacitance formula given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance between the two plates .",
    "apart from the usual electrostatic fringe effect , there are quantum corrections to the classical formula .",
    "quantum corrections come from several sources : a finite density of states of the plates , a finite screening length to the electron - electron interactions , and quantum tunneling .",
    "the quantum correction to classical formula due to density of states ( dos ) has been theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite investigated in the literature by a number of authors . for semiconductor heterojunctions they found that dos contributes a factor to the capacitance given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total density of states of the system .",
    "thus the total capacitance @xmath4 is a result of a series connection of @xmath5 and @xmath6 : @xmath7 .",
    "this formula has been theoretically studied from a dynamic point of view and was derived in the low frequency limit of an ac theory@xcite .",
    "significantly , these investigations on dos effects focused on the _ linear _ capacitance coefficient @xmath4 , namely @xmath4 is the linear coefficient of the charge pile - up on a capacitor plate as a function of the external bias voltage . recently some attention@xcite has been paid to the nonlinear regime : due to the nonlinear bias dependence of local dos there is also a nonlinear bias dependence of the nonequilibrium charge .",
    "the nonlinear capacitance coefficients is one of the topics which will be further investigated below .",
    "mesoscopic electrochemical capacitance has been found@xcite to obey , within a magnetic field , weaker onsager - casimir symmetry relations .",
    "for example it is no longer a symmetric function of magnetic field@xcite . the asymmetry of electrochemical capacitance has been observed for a gate close to the edge of a quantum hall bar@xcite .",
    "the magneto - electrochemical capacitance of a three - dimensional quantum dot with three - probes has been studied numerically in detail in ref .. it is found that at low magnetic fields the magnetocapacitance shows a large asymmetry under a magnetic field reversal . at higher fields",
    "the capacitance is dominated by aharonov - bohm type oscillations and the fluctuations of the asymmetry is somewhat reduced . for the iii - v tunneling heterostructures ,",
    "the contribution of the density of states on the magnetocapacitance is also studied@xcite .",
    "the investigation of the frequency dependent electrochemical capacitance for a parallel plate capacitor within the nonequilibrium green s function formalism show interesting oscillatory behavior which is related to the retardation effect of the maxwell equations@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , quantum tunneling effect changes the capacitance value as predicted by the classical formula .",
    "this effect was recently addressed using numerical analysis of atomic junctions@xcite .",
    "numerical calculations@xcite of aluminum atomic junctions with tiny dos showed that at small distances @xmath1 , the electrochemical capacitance @xmath8 actually _ increases _ with @xmath1 which is due to tunneling effect .",
    "one expects that at larger @xmath1 when tunneling effects is diminished , the capacitance would follow a crossover to the classical prediction .",
    "however due to the very small dos of the atomic junction@xcite , no crossover to the classical formula was found in these atomic systems .",
    "the correction to classical capacitance formula due to a finite screening length was most clearly demonstrated from a dynamic point of view on the electrochemical capacitance , due to the work of christen and bttiker@xcite where a conducting quantum point contact ( qpc ) was found to establish a nonequilibrium charge resulting to a finite electrochemical capacitance . in particular",
    "they have derived a formula for a qpc with a semiclassical method@xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is essentially a reflection probability of the qpc , @xmath5 is geometric capacitance , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the total dos in the regions to the left and to the right of the qpc .",
    "qualitatively , the numerical data of the aluminum tunnel junction@xcite were consistent with eq .",
    "( [ semiclassical ] ) in that @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "formula ( [ semiclassical ] ) is termed `` semiclassical '' because not all the relevant scattering local partial density of states ( lpdos ) were included in its derivation .",
    "the notion of scattering lpdos was proposed by bttiker@xcite and subsequently by gasparian , christen and bttiker@xcite , and it plays a very important role in low frequency ac transport as well as nonlinear dc transport .",
    "lpdos describes the probability of various scattering processes@xcite .",
    "consider a tunnel barrier as shown in fig .",
    "an example of a lpdos is denoted by @xmath13 which is the contribution of carriers at position @xmath14 to the dos , and these carriers come from region @xmath15 and ultimately return to region @xmath15 . although region @xmath15 is on the right hand side of the tunnel barrier ( see fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) , @xmath16 even when @xmath14 is on the left hand side of the barrier due to tunneling . in deriving@xcite",
    "( [ semiclassical ] ) for a qpc , contributions such as @xmath13 with position @xmath14 on the other side of the qpc , has been neglected .    in this paper",
    ", we will further investigate nanoscale capacitors where the two conductors have a dc coupling , namely there is a dc `` leakage '' from one conductor to the other .",
    "for the linear electrochemical capacitance of a tunnel barrier , we improve formula ( [ semiclassical ] ) by including the tunneling contributions of various lpdos . this way a full quantum capacitance formula is derived and",
    "will be compared with ( [ semiclassical ] ) . for a single tunnel barrier",
    "there is a quantitative difference between these results in the quantum regime , and the difference diminishes as the classical limit is approached . the quantum formula and eq .",
    "( [ semiclassical ] ) allow investigations of a crossover from tunneling dominated regime to the classical regime , by varying the barrier width @xmath1 .",
    "our derivation as well as the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ semiclassical ] ) are within the discrete potential model@xcite that used an approximation where the space is coarse grained into a few regions . for the tunnel barrier",
    "they are regions to the left of the barrier ( denoted by @xmath17 ) , to the right of the barrier ( @xmath18 ) , and the barrier region . to confirm that this approximation does not affect the predictions qualitatively ,",
    "we have carried out extensive numerical calculations of the lpdos by directly solving them without the approximation .",
    "recently , the theory of non - linear electrochemical capacitance has been formulated using the response theory@xcite .",
    "the electrochemical capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is a nonlinear function of the bias voltage due to the finite dos near the plates as mentioned above . in this work",
    "we will study effect of screening on the nonlinear electrochemical capacitance for the `` leaky '' capacitor , which is an important problem not investigated before and is relevant for experiments of scanning capacitance microscopy@xcite applied to nanosystems .",
    "we will derive a general expression of the second and third order nonlinear quantum electrochemical capacitance using the discrete potential model@xcite .",
    "our analysis naturally deduces , in appropriate approximations , a semiclassical expression of the _ second order _ nonlinear electrochemical capacitance for qpc . finally , to compare with results of the discrete potential model and semiclassical result ,",
    "we have directly solved the poisson equation and calculated numerically the linear and the second order nonlinear electrochemical capacitance as a function of barrier width of a single tunneling barrier .",
    "the main results of our investigation are summarized in the following sections . in the next section we present our theory of the nonlinear electrochemical capacitance where full quantum tunneling effect is taken into account . at the linear order",
    ", we compare the quantum formula with the semiclassical formula ; and using scattering green s functions we derive second and third order nonlinear results . in sections",
    "iii we present numerical calculations which is compared with the theoretical analysis .",
    "finally the last section summarizes the main findings .",
    "in general a two - probe system can be considered as having three regions , a scattering region and two electrodes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "( 1 ) where the scattering region includes the scattering potential barrier , and two electrodes are the regions to the left ( @xmath17 ) and to the right ( @xmath18 ) of the barrier .",
    "we are interested in the electrochemical capacitance of this system by including the full quantum effects . if we refer regions @xmath17 and @xmath18 as the two conductors of a capacitor , we are dealing with a `` leaky '' capacitor since the potential barrier provides a dc coupling between the conductors . far away from the the regions , the system is connected to contacts which are viewed as large thermodynamic reservoirs , hence in the contacts the electron distributions are fermi - dirac .",
    "when a voltage @xmath19 is applied at contact 1 and @xmath20 at contact 2 , assume @xmath21 , the electron energy band at contact 1 is changed by @xmath22 and at contact 2 by @xmath23 .",
    "the relative electrochemical potential difference is thus @xmath24 : due to @xmath25 electrons are injected into the system .",
    "the force acting on electrons comes from a combination of external and internal fields . in principle ,",
    "motion of electrons in the total field can be solved by schrdinger equation . in particular we will adopt the scattering matrix approach formulated by landauer@xcite , imry@xcite , and bttiker@xcite to solve the single electron transport problem which gives the necessary lpdos needed for the calculation of electrochemical capacitance .",
    "study of electrochemical capacitance is closely related to the calculation of changes of the local band @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that this local band change near the tunnel barrier is different from the shift @xmath27 which occurs at the contacts far away from the barrier . at equilibrium conditions",
    "the electron energy near the barrier is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electron energy at fermi level without the applied voltage .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the electrochemical potential change in reservoir @xmath30 .",
    "near the barrier electrons accumulate for regions where @xmath31 and deplete for regions where @xmath32 .",
    "it is these accumulated charges which we must evaluate .",
    "the internal potential build - up @xmath26 can be solved by a self - consistent poisson equation . for simplicity of discussion , in the following we use @xmath33 and @xmath34 to denote this potential in regions @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "furthermore , analytical derivation of capacitance formula in terms of microscopic quantities is possible if we use a space - averaged potential @xmath37 to replace the space dependent potential @xmath38 , as was done in ref .. this corresponds to the discrete potential model proposed by christen and buttiker@xcite .",
    "we represent the number of electrons in the region @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) incident from contact @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) by @xmath43 , which is a function of electron energy @xmath44 .",
    "hence @xmath45 .",
    "the number of electrons without external bias ( at equilibrium ) is thus @xmath46 , because @xmath47 when @xmath48 . by definition ,",
    "the electrostatic ( geometrical ) capacitance @xmath5 between the two regions @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by @xmath49 ( or by @xmath50 ) where @xmath51 ( @xmath40 ) is the charge measured from the equilibrium value in region @xmath52 regardless where they have come from , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 $ ] , where , to avoid confusion we use @xmath54 to denote the regions from now on . since there are two electrodes ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath42 , @xmath51 thus consists of two parts .",
    "for example , in region @xmath55 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath56 ) , a part of @xmath57 is due to electrons incident from electrode @xmath58 which are scattered back to region @xmath56 .",
    "we denote this part of @xmath59 by @xmath60 .",
    "the second part of @xmath57 comes from electrons launched at electrode @xmath61 but ended up in region @xmath56 , this part is expressed by @xmath62 .",
    "hence @xmath63 .",
    "the above partition of local charge according to where it comes from can be equally applied to the scattering local partial density of states@xcite .",
    "hence , for example , @xmath64 is the lpdos which is the dos for an electron incident from electrode @xmath15 passing through region @xmath65 and reaching electrode @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , @xmath67 is the lpdos which is the dos for an electron incident from electrode @xmath15 passing through region @xmath65 and eventually returning to electrode @xmath15@xcite .",
    "both of these lpdos describe the tunneling process .",
    "this latter term is neglected for a semiclassical calculations and is nonzero for a quantum analysis , as emphasized in ref . .",
    "they both contribute to the electrochemical capacitance@xcite which is the experimentally measured capacitance defined by @xmath68 the rest of the paper is devoted to calculate @xmath69 including all the quantum effects discussed above .",
    "based on the above discussions , we can write down the following two equations@xcite for the classical geometrical capacitance . using charges of region @xmath55 , @xmath70 using charges of region @xmath71 , @xmath72 because the same charge defines electrochemical capacitance @xmath69 as given by eq .",

    "we have assumed that @xmath69 has no bias voltage dependence@xcite . in general the above derivatives",
    "should be done at a finite bias voltage @xmath79 , but experimentally one can control this parameter and use very small voltages@xcite @xmath87 .",
