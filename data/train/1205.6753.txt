    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropy made by the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite and by the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite have provided valuable general confirmation of the theoretical predictions of the shape of the cmb anisotropy at arcminute angular scales , in the diffusion damping regime .",
    "while the inclusion of these new small - scale data do not significantly alter the constraints on parameters of the `` standard '' @xmath6cdm cosmological model @xcite , compared to those obtained by using the wmap satellite cmb anisotropy data in conjunction with other cosmological measurements @xcite , they can be used to significantly improve the constraints on those new ,  beyond - standard - model \" , parameters that mostly affect the physics of the cmb anisotropy diffusion damping tail .",
    "in particular , the recent act and spt data have placed new constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , @xmath8 , that defines the physical energy density in relativistic particles today , @xmath11 , given by @xmath12\\rho{_\\gamma } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the energy density of the cmb photons at present temperature @xmath14  k ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the standard scenario ,",
    "assuming three active massless neutrino species with standard electroweak interactions , the expected value is @xmath15 , slightly larger than 3 because of non - instantaneous neutrino decoupling ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the new data from act and spt , jointly analysed with earlier , large - scale wmap ( and other ) data , rule out the case of @xmath16 at high statistical significance .",
    "that is , for the first time , cmb anisotropy and large - scale structure observations confirm the existence of neutrinos .",
    "however , these data also seem to prefer a value of @xmath17 , hinting at the presence of an additional relativistic component ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , over and above the three neutrino species in the standard model of particle physics . in particular , some of us , @xcite , found @xmath18 at @xmath19 confidence level from such an analysis and similar results are presented in refs .  @xcite .",
    "these results are significant , since they rather strongly suggest that cmb anisotropy data ( alone or in conjunction with other large - scale cosmological data ) indicate the presence of some kind of `` dark radiation '' that is not seen in any other cosmological data .",
    "they have prompted the development of many theoretical models in which @xmath8 is larger than @xmath20 , @xcite .",
    "several non standard models related to axions or decaying particles , gravity waves , extra dimensions and dark energy @xcite can infact predict a larger value for @xmath8 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to carefully investigate this result , to see if it can be strengthened or weakened by , for example , considering a slightly different choice of data .",
    "it is well known in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath8 is degenerate with the value of the hubble constant @xmath4 . assuming a prior on the value of the hubble constant is therefore a key step in the determination of @xmath8 from the data .",
    "the prior on the hubble constant used in most recent analyses , labeled hst , is a gaussian one based on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath0 , including systematics .",
    "while this 3% determination of @xmath4 is certainly impressive , one might wonder if a slightly different hubble constant prior could change the preference for @xmath21 .",
    "there are several indications that a different hubble constant prior could be more appropriate .",
    "for instance , a number of measurements result in a significantly lower value of @xmath4 ; e.g. , the ref .",
    "@xcite summary value is @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , a standard analysis , under the assumption of @xmath15 , of cmb data alone is able ( in a flat universe ) to constrain the hubble constant .",
    "recent such analyses yield @xmath23 , more than one standard deviation away from the hst value .",
    "for example , the analysis of act and wmap7 data in ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , there is also observational evidence for a significantly smaller value of @xmath4 than the hst estimate .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that using a prior with a lower value of @xmath4 could result in a @xmath8 determined from cmb anisotropy and other large - scale data that is consistent with the other cosmological @xmath8 determinations .",
    "there are very many measurements of @xmath4 , over 550.huchra/. ] most recent estimates lie in the interval 6075@xmath24 , with error bars on some individual estimates probably being too small , since these measurements are mutually inconsistent ( this is likely a consequence of underestimated systematic errors in some cases ) .",
    "clearly , what is needed is a convincing summary observational estimate of @xmath4 . to date , the best technique for deriving such a summary estimate  that does not make use of the error bars of the individual measurements",
    " is the median statistics technique ; ref .",
    "@xcite includes a detailed description of this technique .",
    "the median statistics technique has been used to analyse a number of cosmological data sets .",
    "these include type ia supernova apparent magnitude data , to show that the current cosmological expansion is accelerating , @xcite ; cmb temperature anisotropy data , in one of the first analyses to show that these data were consistent with flat spatial hypersurfaces , @xcite ; and , collections of measurements of the cosmological clustered mass density , in one of the earliest analyses to show that this makes up around 2530% of the current epoch cosmological energy budget , @xcite .",
    "these successes support the idea that a median statistics estimate of the hubble constant provides an accurate summary estimate .",
    "the median statistics technique has been used thrice to analyse huchra s list ( at three different epochs ) . from an analysis of 331 measurements ( up to the middle of 1999 ) , ref .",
    "@xcite found an median statistics summary @xmath25 ; from 461 measurements ( up to the middle of 2003 ) , and from 553 measurements ( up to early 2011 ) , refs .",
    "@xcite both found a median statistics summary @xmath26 . while the estimated statistical error bar ( given by the scatter in the central @xmath4 values ) has decreased as the sample size has increased , the larger ( and dominant ) systematic error bar ( estimated from the scatter in the summary values of @xmath4 determined by different techniques ) has changed much less .    for our analyses",
    "here we estimate @xmath4 using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite but now excluding from the huchra list of 553 measurements the 16 @xmath4 measurements derived from cmb data assuming @xmath15 .",
    "we exclude these @xmath27 cmb measurements as we want an external and independent prior on @xmath4 to use in our analysis of the latest cmb datasets . from a median statistics analysis of the 537 non - cmb measurements we find @xmath28 ( one standard deviation error ) , identical to that found in ref .",
    "@xcite from an analysis of the 553 measurements . in what follows",
    "we refer to the gaussian prior based on this value as the median statistics ( ms ) @xmath4 prior .",
    "our goal here is to discuss the implications of assuming the ms prior for @xmath4 , instead of the usual hst prior , for current cmb and large - scale structure parameter inference .",
    "we focus much of our attention on the value of @xmath8 and the evidence for dark radiation , but we also consider how the ms prior changes the estimated value of other parameters , including the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath29 and the spectral index of primordial fluctuations @xmath30 .    our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the data analysis method we use . in sec .",
    "iii we present our results .",
    "we conclude in sec .  iv .",
    "our analysis is based on a modified version of the public cosmomc @xcite monte carlo markov chain code .",
    "we include the following cmb data : wmap7 @xcite , acbar @xcite , act @xcite , and spt @xcite , including measurements up to maximum multipole number @xmath31 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we include galaxy clustering data from the sdss - dr7 luminous red galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "also , as discussed in the introduction , we choose two different priors on the hubble constant : the median statistics ( ms ) prior of @xmath28 as well as , for comparison , the hst prior @xcite used in previous analyses .    in the basic analysis we sample the usual seven - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath34 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath35 , the scalar spectral index @xmath30 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath36 at @xmath37 , the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath8 .",
    "our analysis is very similar to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , with three changes : ( i ) we consider two different @xmath4 priors ; ( ii ) we consider an extended case where we assume massive neutrinos , we enlarge our parameter space varying the total mass of neutrinos @xmath38 ; ( iii ) we allow the helium abundance @xmath39 to vary consistently with standard bbn following ref .",
    "this means that each theoretical cmb angular spectrum is computed assuming a value for @xmath39 derived by bbn nucleosynthesis from the input values of @xmath40 and @xmath8 of the theoretical model considered .",
    "the small uncertainty on @xmath39 derived from the experimental errors on the neutron half - life produces negligible changes in the cmb angular spectra so we ignore it . in a latter case",
    "we also vary @xmath39 as a free parameter .",
    "in addition , where indicated , we also present constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath29 ( the ratio of the pressure to energy density of the dark energy fluid ) , assumed to be redshift independent , although the corresponding dark energy density is time dependent .",
    "we consider massless neutrinos , adiabatic initial conditions , and a spatially - flat universe .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we account for foreground contributions by marginalizing over three additional amplitudes : the sunyaev - zeldovich effect amplitude @xmath41 , the amplitude of clustered point sources @xmath42 , and the amplitude of poisson - distributed point sources @xmath43 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the standard @xmath6cdm cosmological model has some conceptual problems that are partially alleviated in some models in which the dark energy density varies slowly in time ( and so weakly in space ) , @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "observational constraints on cosmological parameters are model dependent , i.e. , the observational estimate of a cosmological parameter , e.g. , @xmath8 , depends on the cosmological model used to analyse the data .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine the observational cosmological constraints on @xmath8 in a cosmological model in which the dark energy density varies in time , such as that of ref .",
    "this is a somewhat challenging task that we will leave for future work .",
    "however , to get an indication of what could be expected from such an analysis , we determine the observational constraints on @xmath8 in a cosmological model in which the time - evolving dark energy density is parametrized by the xcdm parametrization ( made complete by assuming that the acoustic spatial inhomogeneities propagate at the speed of light ) described above .",
    "table [ wvar ] shows the observational constraints derived under these assumptions .    from table [ wvar ]",
    "we see that the ms prior changes the best fit @xmath29 in the standard case with @xmath15 to @xmath44 , with @xmath45 off by one standard deviation .",
    "when both @xmath29 and @xmath8 are allowed to vary freely the geometrical degeneracy with @xmath4 makes the hst and ms @xmath4 priors much less effective . in this case",
    "the evidence for dark radiation is again significant : for the ms @xmath4 prior case we find @xmath46 , and a dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath47 , i.e. , excluding a cosmological constant at more than two standard deviations .",
    "a scale - invariant hpyz primordial spectrum with @xmath48 is fully consistent with both priors . while some of these values indicate significant tensions with the standard @xmath6cdm model , it is important to keep in mind the strong degeneracies between @xmath8 , @xmath4 and @xmath29 , as well as the fact that the xcdm parametrization used in the analysis has been arbitrarily completed to allow for an accounting of the evolution of density inhomogeneities .    in order to try to break these degeneracies , and derive more reliable constraints on the parameters , we perform a new analysis that also include the sdss supernova type ia ( sneia ) apparent magnitude data , @xcite . from table",
    "[ snwvar ] we see that the inclusion of the sneia data bring the results back to the previous dichotomy : the hst prior clearly shows a preference for @xmath49 while the ms prior results in a value of @xmath8 that is in much better agreement with the standard scenario .",
    "the constraints on the equation of state are @xmath50 for the hst prior and @xmath51 for the ms prior .",
    "the hpyz spectrum with @xmath48 is again in tension with the observations for the ms @xmath4 prior at a little less than two standard deviations .",
    "a `` standard '' cosmological model is starting to fall in place .",
    "interestingly , recent data have provided some indication for an unexpected new `` dark radiation '' component . in this brief paper",
    "we have again emphasized the important role played by the hst @xmath4 prior in establishing the statistical evidence for the existence of this dark radiation .",
    "we have also shown that with a new median statistics @xmath4 prior derived from 537 non - cmb @xmath4 measurements , there is no significant evidence for @xmath52 , consistent with the indications from other cosmological data . and",
    "it is probably not unreasonable to believe that the converse might also be true : with other cosmological data not inconsistent with @xmath53 , consistency of the smaller - scale cmb anisotropy data with the predictions of the @xmath6cdm model apparently demands @xmath54 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that when the same data are analysed in the context of the somewhat arbitrarily - completed xcdm dark energy parametrization , they prefer @xmath49",
    ". it would be useful to see if this remains the case if , instead of xcdm , a complete and consistent model , such as @xmath55cdm , is used in the analysis .",
    "we have shown that the hst @xmath4 prior is , at least partially , responsible for the evidence supporting the existence of a new dark radiation component .",
    "however , future cmb anisotropy and galaxy clustering data , as well as a definitive determination of @xmath4 , will be needed to fully resolve this issue .",
    "in particular , the future data expected from the planck satellite should be able to constrain independently the values of @xmath4 and @xmath8 , clarifying if the current tension between the hst and cmb constraints on @xmath4 is due to a dark radiation component or systematics in the data .",
