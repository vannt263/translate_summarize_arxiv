    "nonlinear dissipative oscillator ( ndo ) operated in the quantum regime is becoming significant in both fundamental and applied sciences , particularly , for implementation of basic quantum optical systems , in engineering of nonclassical states and quantum logic .",
    "the important implementations have recently been realized in the context of superconducting devices based on the nonlinearity of the josephson junction ( jj ) exhibiting a wide variety of quantum phenomena ( see , the reviews @xcite , @xcite and @xcite-@xcite ) . in some of these devices , dynamics are analogous to those of a quantum particle in an oscillatory anharmonic potential @xcite .",
    "the single nonlinear oscillator and systems of nonlinear oscillators also consist of basic theoretical models for various nano - electro - mechanical and nano - opto - mechanical devices . in the last decade",
    "there was exciting technological advances in the fabrication and control of such devices @xcite-@xcite that are attracting interest in a broad variety of research areas and for many possible applications due to their remarkable combination of properties : small mass , high operating frequency , large quality factor , and easily accessible nonlinearity .",
    "nanomechanical oscillators are being developed for a host of nanotechnological applications .",
    "they are ideal candidates for probing quantum limits of mechanical motion in an experimental setting .",
    "moreover , they are the basis of various precision measurements @xcite-@xcite , as well as for basic research in the mesoscopic physics of phonons @xcite , and the general study of the behavior of mechanical degrees of freedom at the interface between the quantum and the classical worlds @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of quantum oscillatory effects requires a high nonlinearity with respect to dissipation .",
    "however , for weak damping even small nonlinearity can become important .",
    "development of driven ndo in quantum regime requires cooling these systems to their ground state and significant advances have been made in cooling the systems to far below the temperature of the environment @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is well known that classically , the nonlinearity - induced dependence of the oscillatory frequency or the amplitude usually leads to bistability of the driven ndo @xcite .",
    "the corresponding systems describe amplifiers which are ubiquitous in experimental physics .",
    "the josephson junction amplifier has been discussed in @xcite as a bistable amplifier which has particular interest .",
    "the dynamical bifurcation of a rf - biased josephson junction was proposed to be used as a basis for the amplification of quantum signals in @xcite .",
    "though the bistability has been usually treated as a classical signature of the ndo the quantum dynamics in the bistable region has been a new subject in the past years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "quantum dynamics of an oscillator is naturally described by fock states , that have definite numbers of energy quanta . however , these states are hard to create in experiments because excitations of oscillatory systems usually lead to the production of coherent states but not quantum fock states .",
    "nevertheless , quantum oscillatory states can be prepared and can be manipulated by coupling oscillators to atomic systems driven by classical pulses .",
    "the systematic procedure has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been demonstrated for deterministic preparation of mechanical oscillatory fock states with trapped ions @xcite , in cavity qeds with rydberg atoms @xcite and in solid - state circuit qed for deterministic preparation of photon number states in a resonator by interposing a highly nonlinear josephson phase qubit between a superconducting resonator @xcite .    for the ndo in quantum regime the nonlinearity makes frequencies of transitions between adjacent oscillatory energy levels different .",
    "thus , strong nonlinearity enables spectroscopic identification and selective excitation of transitions between fock states .",
    "thus , it is possible in this regime to prepare the ndo at low - level of quanta . in this approach",
    ", it has been shown that the production of fock states , fock states superpositions or qubits can also be realized in over - transient regime of an anharmonic dissipative oscillator without any interactions with atomic and spin-1/2 systems and with complete consideration of decoherence effects @xcite .",
    "for this goal the strong kerr nonlinearity as well as the excitation of resolved lower oscillatory energy levels with a specific train of gaussian pulses have been considered .    in this paper",
    "we consider the ndo in the regime of low - level of excitation for the study of the problems of quantum bistability and chaos .",
    "therefore , the goal of the paper is twofold . in one part",
    ", we consider the bistability on a few oscillatory excitation number considering the ndo driven by monochromatic force .",
    "the bistability on a few excitation number is attractive for ultra - low power operation , but it has practical problems related with quantum fluctuation - induced spontaneous switching . in this part , we also demonstrate the production of quantum interference between bistable branches for the ndo driven by a train of gaussian pulses .    the other part of the paper is devoted to investigation of quantum chaos in low - level excitation regime of the pulsed ndo .",
    "much research on the subject of classical and quantum chaos has been done on the base of the kicked rotor , which exhibits regions of regular and chaotic motion .",
    "its experimental realization , and observation of the model s dissipation and decoherence effects are carried out on a gas of ultracold atoms in a magneto - optical trap subjected to a pulsed standing wave @xcite , @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to realize the parametrically kicked nonlinear oscillator model in a cavity involving kerr nonlinearity .",
    "it was also shown that a more promising realization of this system , including the quantum regime , is achieved in the dynamics of cooled and trapped ions , interacting with a periodic sequence of both standing wave pulses and gaussian laser pulses @xcite .",
    "in addition to these and the other important input ( see , also @xcite , @xcite ) in this paper we consider quantum dissipative chaos of the ndo driven by a train of gaussian pulses in a strong quantum regime and in complete consideration of dissipation and decoherence . in this way , quantum dissipative chaos at the limit of low - level of excitation numbers will be considered .",

    "<S> we study nonlinear phenomena of bistability and chaos at a level of few quanta . for this purpose we consider a single - mode dissipative oscillator with strong kerr nonlinearity with respect to dissipation rate driven by a monochromatic force as well as by a train of gaussian pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum effects and decoherence in oscillatory mode are investigated on the framework of the purity of states and the wigner functions calculated from the master equation . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the quantum chaotic regime by means of a comparison between the contour plots of the wigner functions and the strange attractors on the classical poincar section . </S>",
    "<S> considering bistability at low - limit of quanta , we analyze what is the minimal level of excitation numbers at which the bistable regime of the system is displayed ? </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the formation of oscillatory chaotic regime by varying oscillatory excitation numbers at ranges of few quanta . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate quantum - interference phenomena that are assisted hysteresis - cycle behavior and quantum chaos for the oscillator driven by the train of gaussian pulses as well as we establish the border of classical - quantum correspondence for chaotic regimes in the case of strong nonlinearities . </S>"
