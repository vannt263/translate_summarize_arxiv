    "recent observations of high energy galactic positrons , electrons , antiprotons , and gamma rays attracted a great deal of attention on dark matter(dm ) scenarios .",
    "if tev scale decaying dm(ddm ) decays at the present epoch to produce these high energy particles , it needs a very long lifetime ( of order @xmath1 s ) so that its decay is within the allowed limits of experimental observations . on the theoretical side , the standard model(sm )",
    "has been extended to the mssm , mainly to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "this supersymmetric(susy ) extension has found another bonuses : the existence of the lsp @xmath3 as a cold dm candidate and the gauge coupling unification around @xmath4 gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a further extension of the mssm by an additional dm component @xmath0 ( called @xmath5mssm ) to produce enough high energy positrons was suggested together with charged sm singlets @xmath6 to explain pamela s excess positrons @xcite from @xmath7 annihilation .",
    "interestingly , grand unified theories(guts ) allowing charged sm singlets @xmath6 are possible in the flipped su(5 ) gut @xcite , which has an ultraviolet completion in the heterotic string @xcite .",
    "later last year , the atic data raised the dm scale up to tev @xcite , and the genie for tev scale ddm has been let free . with tev ddm @xmath0 , the charged singlet @xmath6 of ref .",
    "@xcite may or may not be needed below the mass scale @xmath8 but @xmath5mssm   can still be considered .",
    "however , the recent _ fermi _ lat data is in conflict with the atic data of several hundred gev electrons @xcite .",
    "even though the tev scale cosmic - ray(cr ) electrons are explained by the known astrophysical backgrounds , pamela s cr positron excess at the 1080 gev range may need another contribution beyond the known backgrounds @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "pamela s low antiproton flux @xcite has been generally regarded as a difficulty of ddm scenario @xcite .",
    "note however that the old background estimates of the h.e.s.s .",
    "data @xcite had large systematic uncertainties .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite considered these uncertainties to allow a leptonic background smaller by a factor 0.85 of the old background value .",
    "if one applies this argument to antiproton flux also , one can allow some antiprotons from ddm decay .",
    "interestingly , pamela s cr antiproton flux above 10 gev has the same shape as the old background estimate , which may be interpreted as ",
    "the old estimate in fact contained extra antiprotons \" .",
    "this new explanation of the old antiproton background allows a room for antiproton injection to the galaxic dm soup from ddm decay .",
    "so , models producing some antiprotons in addition to positrons need not be ruled out from the outset .    with this new perspective",
    ", now it is very interesting to consider the tev scale ddm possibility , even allowing some antiproton flux from the ddm decay though we will skip the discussion of the antiproton flux in this paper . in this spirit",
    ", we consider the tev scale ddm possibility by the simplest extension of the mssm with just one chiral multiplet @xmath0 at the next mass level beyond the mssm , which is an @xmath5mssm   model @xcite .",
    "the supermultiplet @xmath0 contains the bosonic partner @xmath9 and the fermionic partner @xmath0 . for the supermultiplet and its fermionic partner . ]",
    "the chiral field @xmath0 becomes a two - component massive majorana fermion at the true vacuum .",
    "the lsp @xmath3 is assumed to be stable with the unbroken r - parity and may constitute a dominant portion of galactic dm .",
    "then , the tev scale ddm @xmath0 can decay to mssm particles .",
    "the needed range of the @xmath0 lifetime with the stable lsp @xmath3 is @xmath10 s. for two dm components can be gleaned from @xcite . ]",
    "the number density of the @xmath0 chiral multiplet is completely unknown at this point .",
    "but , if some heavier particle @xmath11 dominates the energy density of the universe and decays to both @xmath0 and @xmath3 below the lsp decoupling temperature , it is possible to estimate the relative abundances of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "we explore this possibility , interpreting @xmath11 as the axino @xcite .",
    "the axion has the anomalous coupling to gluons .",
    "so , the heavy axino enables us to estimate the relative abundances of @xmath0 and @xmath3 through the anomalous coupling and a superpotential term , @xmath12 where @xmath13 are coefficients of o(1 ) , @xmath14 are the gauge couplings , and @xmath15s are the vacuum angle terms .",
    "@xmath16 defines the axion : @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the relevant axino decay lagrangian @xcite is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gluino and @xmath20 is the gluon field strength . here",
    ", we neglect the coupling @xmath21 , assuming that the lsp is predominantly bino .",
    "one gluino will produce one lsp in the end , and hence we expect the following @xmath0 and @xmath3 ratio from the axino decay , in the limit @xmath22 , @xmath23 to obtain this ratio at the level of @xmath24 and @xmath25 gev , we need @xmath26 gev which falls in a broad gut scale with our notation of @xmath27@xmath28 gev .",
    "in addition to the mssm symmetries we introduce the r - parity and the peccei - quinn(pq ) symmetry u(1)@xmath29 . in addition , we also introduce _ matter parity @xmath30_. the attractive feature of the pq symmetry is that it solves the strong cp problem , the resulting invisible axion may constitute a cold dm component , and its breaking scale is narrowed down to a window can be larger than @xmath31 gev for a small initial misalignment angle @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath32 gev @xcite so that our estimate of the @xmath0 lifetime is more or less predictive .    the simplest @xmath2 suppression results with four external fields which however can not be expressed as a superpotential term .",
    "this interaction includes a derivative coupling .",
    "an example of the derivative interaction with four external lines is given in fig .",
