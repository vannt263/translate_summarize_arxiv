    "<S> the changes of the spin depolarization length in zinc - blende semiconductors when an external component of correlated noise is added to a static driving electric field are analyzed for different values of field strength , noise amplitude and correlation time . </S>",
    "<S> electron dynamics is simulated by a monte carlo procedure which keeps into account all the possible scattering phenomena of the hot electrons in the medium and includes the evolution of spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> spin depolarization is studied by examinating the decay of the initial spin polarization of the conduction electrons through the dyakonov - perel process , the only relevant relaxation mechanism in iii - v crystals . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , for electric field amplitude lower than the gunn field , the dephasing length shortens with the increasing of the noise intensity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a nonmonotonic behavior of spin depolarization length with the noise correlation time is found , characterized by a maximum variation for values of noise correlation time comparable with the dephasing time . instead , in high field conditions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that , critically depending on the noise correlation time , external fluctuations can positively affect the relaxation length . the influence of the inclusion of the electron - electron scattering mechanism is also shown and discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> possible utilization of the electron spin as an information carrier in electronic devices is an engaging challenge for future spin - based electronics ( spintronics ) . in particular , in semiconductor spin - based devices , </S>",
    "<S> information is encoded in the electron spin state , transferred by the conduction electrons , and finally detected  @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , a disadvantage of the use of spin degree of freedom is the fact that spin polarization is a quantity that is not preserved , as each initial non - equilibrium magnetization decays both in time and distance during the transport . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spin depolarization length could be not long enough to permit a reliable manipulation , control and detection of information . + in spintronic devices , the information stored in a system of polarized electron spins , </S>",
    "<S> can be transferred as attached to mobile carriers by applying an external electric field  @xcite . because of increasing miniaturization , to avoid too much intense electric fields , which could lead the system to exhibit a strongly nonlinear physical behavior , applied voltages are very low . since </S>",
    "<S> , low voltages are more subjected to the background noise , it becomes essential to understand the influence of fluctuations of the electric field on the spin depolarization process . </S>",
    "<S> + the presence of noise is generally considered a disturbance , especially in determining the efficiency of a device , since strong fluctuations can affect its performance . the existence of fluctuations , for example , can limit the lifetime of the information stored in a memory cell , bother the opening ( or closure ) of random logic gates and cause the enlargement of the distribution of arrival times of signals in transmission lines . in quantum computation , </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental problem is the destruction of entangled states of qubits by interaction with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this event is characterized by loss of coherence , which is not suitable for the design of quantum computers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in the last decade , however , an increasing interest has been directed towards possible constructive aspects of noise in the dynamical response of non - linear systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of an external source of noise on the electron transport in gaas crystals in the presence of static and/or periodic electric fields has been studied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , theoretical works which discuss the way to improve the ultra - fast magnetization dynamics of magnetic spin systems by including random fields have been recently published  @xcite . nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , the investigation of the role of noise on the electron spin dynamics in semiconductors is still missing . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper , we investigate the spin relaxation process in low - doped n - type gaas crystals driven by a randomly fluctuating electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the electron transport is simulated by a monte carlo procedure which takes into account all the possible scattering phenomena of hot electrons in the medium , and includes the evolution of the spin polarization vector . </S>",
    "<S> the effects caused by the addition of an external source of correlated noise are investigated by analyzing the change of the spin depolarization length with respect to the value obtained in absence of noise . </S>",
    "<S> our findings show that the presence of a random contribution can affect the value of the decoherence length , and that the variation is maximum for values of the noise correlation time comparable with the characteristic time of the spin relaxation process . </S>",
    "<S> morever , noise induced effects are slightly reduced by the inclusion of the electron - electron coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> + the spin - orbit interaction couples the spin of conduction electrons to the electron momentum , which is randomized by scattering with impurities and phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit coupling gives rise to a spin precession , while momentum scattering makes this precession randomly fluctuating , both in magnitude and orientation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + for electrons delocalized and under nondegenerate regime , the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism @xcite is the only relevant relaxation process in n - type iii - v semiconductors  @xcite . in a semiclassical formalism </S>",
    "<S> , the term of the single electron hamiltonian , which accounts for the spin - orbit interaction , can be written as @xmath0 it represents the energy of electron spins precessing around an effective magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) with angular frequency @xmath2 , which depends on the orientation of the electron momentum vector with respect to the crystal axes . near the bottom of each valley </S>",
    "<S> , the precession vector can be written as @xmath3 \\label{effectivefieldgammavalley}\\ ] ] in the @xmath4-valley  @xcite , @xmath5 \\label{effectivefieldlvalley}\\ ] ] in the l - valleys located along the [ 111 ] direction in the crystallographic axes , and @xmath6 \\label{effectivefieldxvalley}\\ ] ] in the x - valleys located along the [ 100 ] direction  @xcite . in equations ( [ effectivefieldgammavalley])-([effectivefieldxvalley ] ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the components of the electron wave vector . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the spin - orbit coupling coefficients . here , we assume @xmath10=@xmath12 ev@xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath11=@xmath15 ev@xmath13@xmath14 , as recently theoretically estimated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while @xmath9 is calculated as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + since the quantum - mechanical description of the electron spin evolution is equivalent to that of a classical momentum @xmath16 experiencing the magnetic field @xmath17 , we describe the spin dynamics by the classical equation of precession motion @xmath18 the dp mechanism acts between two scattering events and reorients the direction of the precession axis and of the effective magnetic field @xmath17 in random and trajectory - dependent way . </S>",
    "<S> this effect leads the spin precession frequencies @xmath2 and their directions to vary from place to place within the electron spin ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> this spatial variation is called _ inhomogeneous broadening _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + when a semiconductor is in contact with a spin polarization source at @xmath19 , in the absence of any magnetic field ( @xmath20 ) and with a static electric field directed along the @xmath21-direction ( @xmath22 ) , the drift - diffusion model predicts an exponential decay of the spin polarization @xmath23 , in which @xmath24 is the electric - field - dependent spin depolarization length  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin dephasing length can be seen as the distance that the electrons move with average drift velocity @xmath25 within the spin lifetime @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the electron mobility , @xmath29 the elementary charge , @xmath30 the momentum relaxation time and @xmath31 the electron effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> + the inhomogeneous broadening , quantified by the average squared precession frequency @xmath32 , together with the correlation time of the random angular diffusion of spin vector @xmath33 are the relevant variables in the dyakonov - perel s formula @xmath34 since , in our case , we include the electron - electron interaction mechanism , one needs to distinguish between the momentum relaxation time @xmath30 and the momentum redistribution time @xmath35 , which is practically equal to @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this distinction is necessary because , although electron - electron scattering contributes to momentum redistribution , it does not directly lead to momentum relaxation  @xcite . + by using equations ( [ length ] ) and ( [ dpformulae ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , the spin depolarization length can be expressed in the form , @xmath36 in our simulations the semiconductor bulk is driven by a fluctuating electric field @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the amplitude of the deterministic part and @xmath39 is a random term , modeled by a stochastic process . here , @xmath39 is modeled as an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process , which obeys the stochastic differential equation  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are , respectively , the correlation time and the intensity of the noise described by the ou process with autocorrelation function + @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean @xmath45 , and autocorrelation function @xmath46 . within the framework of the ito s calculus </S>",
    "<S> , the general solution of the equation  ( [ ornstein ] ) leads to the following expression for the stochastic evolution of the amplitude of the electric field @xmath47 where the initial condition is @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the wiener process  @xcite . + in a practical system , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 could be generated by a rc circuit driven by a source of gaussian white noise , with correlation time @xmath50 ( see equation ( [ ornstein ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian white noise can be generated either by the zener breakdown phenomenon in a diode or in a inversely polarized base - collector junction of a bjt , either by amplifying the thermal noise in a resistor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation time @xmath41 is tunable by using a diode ( varicap ) with a voltage - dependent variable capacitance ; the noise intensity @xmath42 can be chosen , for example , by suitably amplifying the noise produced through the zener stochastic process .    [ htbp ]    the monte carlo code used here follows the procedure described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarization vector has been incorporated into the algorithm as an additional quantity and calculated for each free carrier . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the electron - electron scattering is included , as extensively described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all simulations are performed in a gaas crystal with a free electrons concentration equal to @xmath51 @xmath52 and lattice temperature @xmath53 equal to @xmath54 k. the temporal step is @xmath55 fs and an ensemble of @xmath56 electrons is used to collect spin statistics . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we assume that all donors are ionized and that the free electron concentration is equal to the doping concentration . </S>",
    "<S> all physical quantities of interest are calculated after a transient time of typically @xmath57 time steps , long enough to achieve the steady - state transport regime . </S>",
    "<S> the spin relaxation simulation starts with all electrons of the ensemble initially polarized @xmath58 along @xmath59-axis of the crystal , at the injection plane @xmath60  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin lifetime @xmath26 and the spin depolarization length @xmath24 are calculated by extracting , respectively , the time and the distance from the injection plane of the center of mass of the electron ensemble , corresponding to a reduction of the initial spin polarization by a factor @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]    in figure  [ fig:1 ] , we show the electron spin average polarization @xmath62 as a function of the distance traveled by the center of mass of the electron cloud from the injection point , in the presence of a fluctuating field characterized by a deterministic component with amplitude @xmath38 and a random component with standard deviation @xmath63 , for three different values of noise correlation time @xmath41 : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and in absence of noise ; @xmath67 is the spin relaxation time obtained in absence of noise at the same value of @xmath38 . in panel </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) : @xmath68 kv / cm and @xmath69 kv / cm ; in panel ( b ) : @xmath70 kv / cm and @xmath71 kv / cm . + when @xmath72 , the spin dephasing process is not affected by the fluctuations of the electric field , which have a negligible memory ( @xmath41 ) with respect to the characteristic time @xmath67 of the system . in particular , under low electric field condition [ panel ( a ) ] </S>",
    "<S> , the spin relaxation process is significantly influenced by the fluctuating field only for values of noise correlation time comparable with @xmath67 , while the process becomes quasi - deterministic when @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> differently , under high electric field condition [ panel ( b ) ] when @xmath74 and @xmath73 , a slow down of the spin relaxation process is observed . </S>",
    "<S> + with the aim of investigating the effects of the correlated noise source on the spin depolarization process , we performed @xmath75 different realizations and evaluated both average values and error bars of the extracted spin depolarization lengths . </S>",
    "<S> + in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig:2 ] , we show the ratio between the spin depolarization length @xmath24 in the presence of noise and @xmath76 , obtained in absence of noise , as a function of the ratio between the noise correlation time @xmath41 and @xmath67 , at different values of noise intensity @xmath42 and with @xmath68 kv / cm . for these values of parameters , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 @xmath78 m and @xmath79 ns . the addition of a source of correlated fluctuations , characterized by @xmath80 , reduces the values of the spin depolarization length @xmath24 up to 25% . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath81 is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath82 which exhibits a minimum for @xmath83 . for both @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the values of @xmath24 coincide with those of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the minimum , which becomes deeper with the increasing of the noise amplitude , can be explained by analyzing the temporal evolution of the quantities related to the electron transport and to the spin relaxation process . in panels ( b ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) of figure  [ fig:2 ] , we report the electric field amplitude @xmath84 and the squared precession frequency @xmath85 , respectively , as a function of time @xmath86 . for very low values of @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath87 symmetrically fluctuates around its average value , corresponding to that obtained in absence of noise . by increasing the value of @xmath41 , the effective electric field felt by electrons , within a time window comparable with the spin relaxation time , becomes very different from the value @xmath38 [ panel ( b ) ] . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution of @xmath87 shows an evident asymmetry in the same temporal window [ panel ( c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> because of the proportionality between the electron momentum @xmath88 and the electric field @xmath84 , the equation ( [ effectivefieldgammavalley ] ) leads to a quadratic relation between @xmath84 and @xmath87 on the @xmath89 term and at fourth power on the other two terms . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the values of @xmath90 greater than @xmath38 give rise to values of @xmath87 much greater than those obtained for @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> so , in accordance with equation  ( [ dpformulae ] ) , the asymmetry of @xmath85 is responsible for the observed reduction of spin lifetime . by further increasing the value of @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> , the random fluctuating term @xmath39 of the electric field tends to its initial value @xmath48 [ see equation  ( [ ornstein ] ) ] , and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the behavior of system becomes quasi - deterministic and the spin dephasing length @xmath24 approaches its deterministic value @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> +    [ htbp ]    in figure  [ fig:3 ] ( a ) , we show the ratio @xmath81 as a function of @xmath82 for @xmath70 kv / cm , at different values of noise intensity @xmath42 . for these values of parameters , @xmath93 nm and @xmath94 ps . in the presence of a driving electric field greater than the necessary static field to allow the electrons to move towards the upper energy valleys , the gunn field @xmath95 kv / cm , we find a positive effect of the field fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , despite the error bars are large , our findings show that the addition of correlated fluctuations , characterized by @xmath96 , can increase the value of the spin depolarization length @xmath24 up to the 20% of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is maximum for @xmath97 . for the reasons discussed above , even in the high field case , both for very high and very low values of noise correlation time @xmath41 , the value of @xmath24 approaches @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a positive effect of noise can be ascribed to the reduction of the electron occupation percentage in @xmath24-valleys , shown in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig:3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this finding , which can be considered as a further example of noise enhanced stability ( nes )  @xcite , leads a greater number of electrons to experience a spin - orbit coupling in @xmath4-valley at least of one order of magnitude weaker than that present in @xmath24-valleys  @xcite , causing a decrease of efficacy of the dp dephasing mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]    although for many decades it has been believed that the electron - electron ( e - e ) coulomb scattering does not contribute to the spin relaxation / dephasing process , in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening in spin precession , each kind of scattering , including spin - conserving scattering , can cause irreversible spin dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the coulomb interaction is fundamental to obtain the correct distribution of the electrons in the @xmath98-space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been shown that e - e scattering inclusion leads to a strong increase of spin relaxation time in bulk semiconductors , in a wide range of electric field amplitude , lattice temperature and doping density  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in order to quantify the effect of the coulomb interaction on the spin depolarization process in the presence of external noise , we show a comparison between the results obtained with the e - e scattering mechanism and without it , analyzing the behavior of @xmath81 , as a function of the ratio between the noise standard deviation @xmath63 and the deterministic value of the driving field @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show the comparison at the values of noise correlation time corresponding with the maximum of the noise effect observed by neglecting the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> each panel of figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the `` ee - points '' , obtained through full calculations including the electron - electron scattering mechanism , and the `` no ee - points '' , calculated without the electron - electron interaction . in panel </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) : @xmath99 and @xmath68 kv / cm , with @xmath100 @xmath78 m and @xmath101 ns ; in panel ( b ) : @xmath102 and @xmath70 kv / cm , with @xmath103 nm and @xmath104 ps ; the new values of @xmath67 and @xmath76 have been obtained by including the coulomb scattering . for @xmath99 , the reduction of the spin depolarization length , caused by fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> is slightly affected from the inclusion of electron - electron scattering mechanism up to values of @xmath63 lower than 40% of the value of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> for values of @xmath105 greater than 0.4 , the inclusion of the e - e scattering leads to a longer spin dephasing length , i.e. the electron - electron scattering mechanism reduces the negative effect of noise . </S>",
    "<S> this effect of the coulomb interaction could be ascribed to the frequent momentum redistribution experienced from the electrons ensemble  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the coulomb interaction inclusion seems to randomize the system also for field amplitude greater than the gunn field . under high electric field conditions , in fact , up to values of @xmath63 lower than 33% of the value of @xmath38 , the quantity @xmath81 is almost not influenced by the inclusion of the e - e mechanism . by increasing the noise amplitude , a slight noise - induced positive effect on spin relaxation length </S>",
    "<S> is found . in this case , the addition of a source of correlated fluctuations , having correlation time comparable with the spin lifetime , enhances the value of the spin depolarization length @xmath24 of only about 10 - 15% .    in this work , for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the noise influence on the electron spin relaxation process in lightly @xmath106-doped gaas semiconductor bulks by also including the electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the findings show that a fluctuating electric field , obtained by adding a correlated source of noise to a static field , can modify the spin depolarization length . for electric fields lower than the gunn field and values of the noise correlation time @xmath74 , </S>",
    "<S> the spin lifetime obtained in absence of noise , a reduction of the spin depolarization length up to 15% has been observed , strongly dependent on the noise intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be explained by the different effective electric field experienced by the electron ensemble , within a time window comparable with @xmath67 . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> in the high electric field regime , for @xmath41=@xmath67 , we find an enhancement of the spin relaxation length up to 15% . </S>",
    "<S> this positive effect can be explained by the decrease of the occupation of the @xmath24-valleys , where the strength of spin - orbit coupling felt by electrons is at least one order of magnitude greater than that present in @xmath4-valley and represents an example of nes in spin depolarization process . </S>",
    "<S> + to conclude , our preliminary results show that the presence of fluctuations in applied voltages changes the maintenance of long spin depolarization lengths in a way strongly dependent on both the strength of the applied electric field and the noise correlation time . </S>",
    "<S> further studies are needed to learn more about the relationship between the semiconductor characteristic time scales , the noise correlation time and the e - e interaction , in order to find the most favorable conditions for the manipulation of electron spins .    </S>",
