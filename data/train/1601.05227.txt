    "landau damping is referred to as the damping of a collective mode of oscillations in plasmas without collisions of charged particles .",
    "these langmuir  @xcite oscillations consist of particles with long - range interactions and can not be treated with a simple picture involving collisions between charged particles .",
    "the damping of such collisionless oscillations was predicted by landau  @xcite .",
    "landau deduced this effect from a mathematical study without reference to a physical explanation .",
    "although correct , this derivation is not rigorous from the mathematical point of view and resulted in conceptual problems .",
    "many publications and lectures have been devoted to this subject  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the search for stationary solutions led to severe problems .",
    "this was solved by case  @xcite and van kampen  @xcite using normal - mode expansions . for many theorists",
    "landau s result is counter - intuitive and the mathematical treatment in many publications led to some controversy and is still debated .",
    "this often makes it difficult to connect mathematical structures to reality .",
    "it took almost 20 years before dedicated experiments were carried out  @xcite to demonstrate successfully the reality of landau damping . in practice",
    ", landau damping plays a very significant role in plasma physics and can be applied to study and control the stability of charged beams in particle accelerators  @xcite .",
    "it is the main purpose of this article to present a physical picture together with some basic mathematical derivations , without touching on some of the subtle problems related to this phenomenon .",
    "the plan of this article is the following .",
    "first , the landau damping in plasmas is derived and the physical picture behind the damping is shown . in the second part",
    "it is shown how the concepts are used to study the stability of particle beams .",
    "some emphasis is put on the derivation of stability diagrams and beam transfer functions ( btfs ) and their use to determine the stability . in an accelerator the decoherence or filamentation of an oscillating beam due to non - linear fields",
    "is often mistaken for landau damping and significant confusion in the community of accelerator physicists still persists today .",
    "nevertheless , it became a standard tool to stabilize particle beams of hadrons . in this article",
    "it is not possible to treat all the possible applications nor the mathematical subtleties and the references should be consulted .",
    "initially , landau damping was derived for the damping of oscillations in plasmas . in the next section",
    ", we shall follow the steps of this derivation in some detail .",
    "we consider an electrically quasi - neutral plasma in equilibrium , consisting of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons ( ) . for a small displacement of the electrons with respect to the ions ( ) , the electric fields act on the electrons as a restoring force ( ) .    due to the restoring force ,",
    "standing density waves are possible with a fixed frequency  @xcite @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the density of electrons , @xmath2 the electric charge , @xmath3 the effective mass of an electron and @xmath4 the permittivity of free space .",
    "the individual motion of the electrons is neglected for this standing wave . in what follows ,",
    "we allow for a random motion of the electrons with a velocity distribution for the equilibrium state and evaluate under which condition waves with a wave vector @xmath5 and a frequency @xmath6 are possible .",
    "the oscillating electrons produce fields ( modes ) of the form @xmath7 or , rewritten , @xmath8 the corresponding wave ( phase ) velocity is then @xmath9 .    in , we show the electron distribution together with the produced field .",
    "the positive ions are omitted in this figure and are assumed to produce a stationary , uniform background field .",
    "this assumption is valid when we consider the ions to have infinite mass , which is a good approximation since the ion mass is much larger than the mass of the oscillating electrons .",
    "the oscillating electrons now interact with the field they produce , i.e. individual particles interact with the field produced by all particles .",
    "this in turn changes the behaviour of the particles , which changes the field producing the forces .",
    "furthermore , the particles may have different velocities .",
    "therefore , a self - consistent treatment is necessary .",
    "if we allow @xmath10 to be complex ( @xmath11 ) , we separate the real and imaginary parts of the frequency @xmath10 and rewrite the fields : @xmath12 and we have a _ damped _ oscillation for @xmath13 .",
    "if we remember that particles may have different velocities , we can consider a much simplified picture as follows .    *",
    "if more particles are moving more slowly than the wave : * net absorption of energy _ from _ the wave @xmath14 wave is damped . * if more particles are moving faster than the wave : * net absorption of energy _ by _ the wave @xmath14 wave is antidamped .",
    "we therefore have to assume that the _ slope _ of the particle distribution at the wave velocity is important .",
    "although this picture is not completely correct , one can imagine a surfer on a wave in the sea , getting the energy from the wave ( antidamping ) .",
    "particles with very different velocities do not interact with the mode and can not contribute to the damping or antidamping .",
    "the basis for the self - consistent treatment of distribution functions is the liouville theorem .",
    "it states that the phase - space distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system , i.e.  the density of system points in the vicinity of a given system point travelling through phase space is constant with time , i.e. the density is always conserved .",
    "if the density distribution function is described by @xmath15 , then the probability to find the system in the phase - space volume @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "we have used canonical coordinates @xmath19 and momenta @xmath20 since it is defined for a hamiltonian system .",
    "the evolution in time is described by the liouville equation : @xmath21 if the distribution function is _ stationary _",
    "( i.e.  does not depend on @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , then @xmath15 becomes @xmath24 .",
    "figure 5 shows schematically the change of a phase - space distribution under the influence of a linear and a non - linear field .",
    "the shape of the distribution function is distorted by the non - linearity , but the _ local _ phase - space density is conserved .",
    "however , the _ global _ density may change , i.e. the ( projected ) measured beam size .",
    "the liouville equation will lead us to the boltzmann and vlasov equations .",
    "we move again to cartesian coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "time evolution of @xmath27 is described by the boltzmann equation : @xmath28 this equation contains a term which describes mutual collisions of charged particles in the distribution @xmath29 . to study landau damping ,",
    "we ignore collisions and the collisionless boltzmann equation becomes the vlasov equation : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the force of the field ( mode ) on the particles",
    ".    why is the vlasov equation useful ?",
    "@xmath30 here @xmath31 can be a force caused by impedances , beam  beam effects etc . from the solution",
    "one can determine whether a disturbance is growing ( instability , negative imaginary part of frequency ) or decaying ( stability , positive imaginary part of frequency ) .",
    "it is a standard tool to study collective effects .      for our problem",
    "we need the force @xmath32 ( depending on field @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 and the field @xmath33 ( depending on potential @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 for the potential @xmath37 ( depending on distribution @xmath38 ) : @xmath39 therefore , @xmath40 we have obtained a set of coupled equations : the perturbation produces a field which acts back on the perturbation .",
    "can we find a solution ?",
    "assume a small _ non - stationary _",
    "perturbation @xmath41 of the _ stationary _ distribution @xmath42 : @xmath43 then we get for the vlasov equation : @xmath44 and @xmath45 the density perturbation produces electric fields which act back and change the density perturbation , which therefore changes with time .",

    "we find two different approaches , one due to vlasov and the other due to landau .",
    "the vlasov equation is a partial differential equation and we can try to apply standard techniques .",
    "vlasov expanded the distribution and the potential as a double fourier transform @xcite : @xmath47 @xmath48 and applied these to the vlasov equation . since we assumed the field ( mode ) of the form @xmath49",
    ", we obtain the condition ( after some algebra ) @xmath50 or , rewritten using the plasma frequency @xmath51 , @xmath52 or , slightly re - arranged for later use , @xmath53 this is the dispersion relation for plasma waves , i.e.  it relates the frequency @xmath6 with the wave vector @xmath5 . for this relation , waves with frequency @xmath6 and",

    "it must be noted that the second term appears only in landau s treatment as a consequence of the initial conditions and is responsible for damping .",
    "the treatment by vlasov failed to find this term and therefore did not lead to a damping of the plasma . evaluating the term @xmath69 we find damping of the oscillations if @xmath70 .",
    "this is the condition for landau damping .",
    "how the dispersion relations for both cases are evaluated is demonstrated in appendix [ sec : app1 ] .",
    "the maxwellian velocity distribution is used for this calculation .",
    "based on these findings , we can give a simplified picture of this condition .",

    "* more ` faster ' than ` slower ' particles @xmath71 antidamping .",
    "this intuitive picture reflects the damping condition derived above .",
    "how to apply it to accelerators ? here we do not have a velocity distribution , but a frequency distribution @xmath72 ( in the transverse plane the tune ) . it should be mentioned here that @xmath72 is the distribution of _ external focusing frequencies_. since we deal with a distribution , we can introduce a frequency spread of the distribution and call it @xmath73 .",
    "the problem can be formally solved using the vlasov equation , but the physical interpretation is very fuzzy ( and still debated ) . here",
    "we follow a different ( more intuitive ) treatment ( following @xcite ) .",

    "* btf and stability diagrams . *",

    "however , the stability of a beam is in general not studied by directly solving this equation , but by introducing the concept of stability diagrams , which allow us more directly to evaluate the stability of a beam during the design or operation of an accelerator .",
    "how does a beam respond to an external excitation ?    to study the dynamics in accelerators , we replace the velocity @xmath26 by @xmath74 to be consistent with the standard literature .",

    "the tune dependence of an octupole ( @xmath183 ) can be written as  @xcite @xmath184    other sources to introduce tune spread are for example :    * space charge ; * chromaticity ; * high - order multipole fields ; * beam  beam effects ( colliders only ) .",
    "the recipe for ` generating ' landau damping is :    * for a multipole field , compute detuning @xmath185 ; * given the distribution @xmath186 ; * compute the stability diagram by scanning frequency , i.e.  the amplitudes .",

    "the point is inside the region and the beam is stable .",
    "an unstable mode ( e.g. after increase of intensity or impedance ) is shown in ( right ) ; it lies outside the stable region .",
    "theoretically , we can increase the octupolar strength to increase the stable region .",
    "however , can we increase the octupole strength as we like ?",
    "there are some downsides as follows .",
    "* octupoles introduce strong non - linearities at large amplitudes and may lead to reduced dynamic aperture and bad lifetime .",
    "* we do not have many particles at large amplitudes ; this requires large strengths of the octupoles .",
    "* can cause reduction of dynamic aperture and lifetime .",
    "* they change the chromaticity via feed - down effects ! * the lesson : use them if you have no other choice .",
    "we see  @xcite that the contribution from octupoles to the stability region mainly comes from large - amplitude particles , i.e.  the population of tails .",
    "this has some frightening consequences : changes in the distribution of the tails can significantly change the stable region .",
    "it is rather doubtful whether tails can be easily reproduced .",
    "furthermore , in accelerators requiring small losses and long lifetimes ( e.g.  colliders ) the tail particles are unwanted and often caught by the collimation system to protect the machine . a reliable calculation of the stability becomes a gamble .",
    "proposals to artificially increase tails in a hadron collider are a bad choice although it had been proposed for fast - cycling machines since they have no need for a long beam lifetime .",
    "we now apply the scheme to the explicit example of head  tail modes",
    ". they can be due to short - range wake fields or broadband impedance , etc .    the growth and damping times of head ",
    "tail modes are usually controlled with chromaticity @xmath187 :    * some modes need positive @xmath187 ; * some modes need negative @xmath187 ; * some modes can be damped by feedback ( @xmath188 ) .    in figs .",
    "2224 , the stability diagrams are shown for different head ",
    "tail modes and different values of the chromaticity @xmath187 .",
    "for a zero chromaticity @xmath189 , the @xmath190 mode is unstable ( ) .    the positive chromaticity stabilizes the @xmath190 mode by shifting it into the stable area  .",
    "a negative chromaticity makes the beam more unstable by shifting the tune shift further into the unstable region .",
    "however , too large positive chromaticity moves higher order head ",
    "tail modes to larger imaginary values , until they may become unstable ( ) .",
    "increasing the chromaticity further than in , the mode @xmath191 becomes unstable .",
    "landau damping is required in this case , but with the necessary care to avoid detrimental effects if this is achieved with octupoles .",
    "can we always stabilize the beam with strong octupole fields ?",
    "* would need very large octupole strength for stabilization . *",
    "the known problems : * * can cause reduction of dynamic aperture and lifetime ; * * lifetime important when beam stays in the machine for a long time ; * * colliders , lifetime more than 1020 h needed .",
    "* is there another option ?    in the case of colliders , the beam  beam effects provide a large tune spread that can be used for landau damping  ( ) .    even when the tune spread is comparable , the stability region from a head - on beam  beam interaction is much increased  @xcite .",
    "we observe a large difference between the two stability diagrams .",
    "where does this difference come from ?",
    "the tune dependence of an octupole can be written as @xmath192 and is linear in the action @xmath193 ( for coefficients , see appendix [ sec : app2 ] ) .    the tune dependence of a head - on beam  beam collision can be written  @xcite as follows : with @xmath194",
    ", we get @xmath195 $ ] . as a demonstration",
    ", we show in the tune spread from octupoles , long - range beam  beam effects  @xcite and head - on beam  beam effects .",
    "the parameters are adjusted such that the overall tune spread is always the same for the three cases . however , the head - on beam  beam tune spread has the largest effect for _ small _ amplitudes , i.e.  where the particle density is largest and the contribution to the stability is strong .",
    "for the tune spreads shown in , we have computed the corresponding stability diagrams  @xcite .",
    "although the tune spread is the same , the stability region shown in is significantly larger . as another and most important advantage ,",
    "since the stability is ensured by small - amplitude particles , the stable region is very insensitive to the presence of tails or the exact distribution function .",
    "special cases such as collisions of ` hollow beams ' are not noteworthy in this overview .",
    "a tune spread is not sufficient to ensure landau damping .",
    "to summarize , we need :    * presence of incoherent frequency ( tune ) spread ; * coherent mode must be inside this spread ; * the same particles must be involved in the oscillation and the spread .",
    "the last item requires some explanation . when the tune spread is not provided by the particles actually involved in the coherent motion , it is not sufficient and results in no damping .",
    "for example , this is the case for coherent beam ",
    "beam modes where the eigenmodes of coherent beam  beam modes driven either by head - on effects or long range interactions are very different  @xcite . for modes driven by the head - on interactions , mainly particles at small amplitudes are participating in the oscillation .",
    "the tune spread produced by long range interactions produces little damping in this case .",
    "another option to damp coherent beam ",
    "beam modes is shown in .",
    "it shows the results of a simulation for the main coherent beam ",
    "beam modes ( 0-mode and @xmath196-mode ) for slightly different intensities .",
    "the difference is sufficient to decouple the two beams and they can not maintain the correct phase .",
    "we have :    * coherent mode inside or outside the incoherent spectrum , depending on the intensity difference ; * landau damping restored when the symmetry is sufficiently broken .      introducing non - linear fields into an accelerator",
    "is not always a desirable procedure .",
    "it may have implications for the beam dynamics and we separate them into three categories .    * good : * * stability region increased .",
    "* bad : * * non - linear fields introduced ( resonances ) ; * * changes optical properties , e.g.  chromaticity ( feed - down ) .",
    "* special cases : * * non - linear effects for large amplitudes ( octupoles ) ; * * much better : head - on beam  beam ( but only in colliders ) .",
    "landau damping with non - linear fields is a very powerful tool , but the side effects and implications have to be taken into account .",
    "the collisionless damping of coherent oscillations as predicted by landau in 1946 is an important concept in plasma physics as well as in other applications such as hydrodynamics , astrophysics and biophysics to mention a few .",
    "it is used extensively in particle accelerators to avoid coherent oscillations of the beams and the instabilities . despite its intensive use ,",
    "it is not a simple phenomenon and the interpretation of the physics behind the mathematical structures is a challenge . even after many decades after its discovery ,",
