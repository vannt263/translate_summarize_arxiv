    "all the known fundamental physical interactions can be formulated in a common framework : as _ local gauge theories_. however the standard theory of gravity , einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , based on the spacetime metric , is a rather unnatural gauge theory .",
    "physically ( and geometrically ) it is reasonable to consider gravity as a gauge theory of the local poincar symmetry of minkowski spacetime . a theory of gravity based on local spacetime geometry gauge symmetry , the quadratic poincar gauge theory of gravity ( pg , aka pgt ) was worked out some time ago .",
    "we briefly sketch this theory , and how the search for good dynamical propagating modes led to focusing on the two scalar modes , and then how cosmological models were used to reveal the dynamics of the resulting model .",
    "there is no known fundamental reason why the gravitational coupling should respect parity . with this in mind , the general quadratic pg theory has recently had a major extension to include all possible odd parity couplings .",
    "the appropriate odd parity couplings have been incorporated , in particular , into the special case of the dynamically favored two scalar mode model . here",
    "we show how a simple effective lagrangian can reveal in a cosmological context the dynamics of this extended model .",

    "the associated field strengths are the torsion and curvature 2-forms @xmath5 which satisfy the respective bianchi identities : @xmath6    turning from kinematics to dynamics , the pg lagrangian density is generally taken to have the standard quadratic yang - mills form , which leads to quasi - linear second order equations for the gauge potentials .",

    "earlier investigations considered only models with even parity terms ; the models had in general 10 dimensionless scalar coupling constants . the recent bhn investigation  @xcite systematically considered all the possible odd parity lagrangian terms , introducing 7 new pseudoscalar coupling constants .",
    "not all of these coupling constants are physically independent , since there are 3 topological invariants : the ( odd parity ) nieh - yan  @xcite identity @xmath12 the ( even parity ) euler 4-form @xmath13 , and the ( odd parity ) chern - simons 4-form @xmath14",

    "the linearized investigations found that at most three modes can be simultaneously dynamic ; all the acceptable cases were tabulated ; many combinations of three modes are satisfactory to linear order . complementing this ,",
    "the hamiltonian analysis revealed the related constraints  @xcite .",
    "then detailed investigations of the hamiltonian and propagation  @xcite concluded that effects due to nonlinearities in the constraints could be expected to render all of these cases physically unacceptable except for the two `` scalar modes '' , carrying spin-@xmath18 and spin-@xmath19 .    in order to further investigate the dynamical possibilities of these pg scalar modes ,",
