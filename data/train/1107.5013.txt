    "most of processes in physics and in technological realm occur under far from the equilibrium ( ffe ) conditions . at the same time , the theories of nonequilibrium behavior were mostly restricted to small deviation from the equilibrium .",
    "a marked progress in approaches to quantitative description of ffe physics is related to keldysh technique - based methods @xcite .",
    "however , mostly ffe systems have been studied within the nonequilibrium form of the mean - field theory , see , for example,@xcite . in the present paper , we address the important question of what happens to the conventional second - order phase transition if the system under consideration is driven out of equilibrium . in equilibrium when close enough to the second order phase transition the mean field theory does not hold and the physics starts to be governed by fluctuations .",
    "@xcite in our work , we construct a theory of fluctuations under ffe conditions . as the exemplary system",
    ", we consider a superconductor ffe in the fluctuational regime .",
    "our first notion is that while in clean three dimensional conventional superconductors the fluctuations are important only in a very narrow region around the superconducting transition line ( usually within the @xmath0k temperature range ) , in high temperature , low - dimensional and organic superconductors the fluctuation region is much wider . in particular ,",
    "as early as in 1968 , aslamazov and larkin , and , independently , maki showed that in disordered thin superconducting films the width of the fluctuation region , which is determined by the sheet resistance , grows noticeably as compared to that of bulk superconductors .",
    "@xcite moreover , it was demonstrated that not only thermodynamic but also dynamic characteristics of the low - dimensional systems are strongly influenced by the fluctuations close to an equilibrium , see e.g. refs .   for a review .",
    "a quantitative approach to nonequilibrium fluctuation superconductivity was recently formulated in refs .  .",
    "building on this approach , we develop further our original keldysh technique enabling us to find nonequilibrium fluctuation contributions to the electrical conductivity of a superconductor above the ( nonequilibrium ) superconducting transition .",
    "we show that by measuring the fluctuation corrections one can infer the parameters of the nonequilibrium state of the superconductor from the experimental data .",
    "further , while in the equilibrium the lifetime of the fluctuation induced cooper pairs is determined by the difference @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the critical temperature@xcite , we find that in ffe conditions it is controlled by the parameters of the nonequilibrium density matrix of the system .",
    "for example , for a thin superconducting film sandwiched between the gate and the substrate , see fig .",
    "[ device ] , these parameters are the temperatures of the gate and of the substrate , and the gate voltage @xmath3 .    , the gate temperature is @xmath4 and the gate voltage is @xmath3 .",
