    "a key problem in data analysis is to detect sinusoidal signals in noise .",
    "such signals are often called `` lines '' or `` peaks '' because in the fourier domain ( frequency space ) they appear as spikes ( line - like features ) or sharp narrow peaks in the energy spectrum of the signal . when the signal is large compared to the noise , such signals are easy to identify .",
    "when they are weak , the identification becomes more difficult .",
    "the work in this paper was motivated by the development of algorithms to search for continuous wave ( cw ) signals in the new generation of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors which are either under construction @xcite or planned @xcite .",
    "these signals are produced by rapidly spinning neutron stars ( pulsars ) .    to search for new ( previously undetected ) pulsars",
    "requires a search over possible sky positions , frequencies , and pulsar spin - down parameters .",
    "the parameter space is very large and these searches are computationally very intensive .",
    "moreover the searches will be looking for signals that are ( statistically ) at the lower limit of detection sensitivity @xcite .",
    "a brute - force approach ( optimally filtering for all possible source parameters ) requires unrealistic computational resources ( petaflops ) , so more sophisticated hierarchical approaches have been proposed .",
    "when the parameter space is very large , these approaches retain much or all of the sensitivity of the brute - force approach but require less computational resources .",
    "this is possible because , in the brute - force approach , the number of grid points in parameter space is so large that the detection threshold must be set very high to avoid false alarms and enable confident detection .",
    "a hierarchical search visits fewer points in parameter space : it ignores those below the ( high ) threshold that one must set in order to gain the necessary detection confidence while examining a large parameter space . in other words a hierarchical search method",
    "does not `` waste '' precious computational cycles examining regions in parameters space where , even if a signal were present , it would not be detected confidently enough .",
    "the hierarchical search techniques @xcite all involve a second ( so - called incoherent ) stage .",
    "this stage is called `` incoherent '' because it uses spectral rather than amplitude data . if one neglects polarization , in all of the proposed approaches a putative signal at the second stage would ( effectively ) appear in a spectrum as a sinusoidal signal at fixed frequency and phase .",
    "the third stage of the search works only on the regions in parameter space where significant spectral lines were identified in the second stage .",
    "our paper addresses the problem of identifying these candidates , that is `` registering '' candidate sinusoidal signals .",
    "the analysis makes use of the neyman - pearson criteria to identify the `` best '' statistic to use for such identification . in some cases ,",
    "the best statistic depends upon the expected amplitude of the signal , which is unknown . in these cases ,",
    "we have used locally - optimal methods to identify the best statistic in the weak - signal limit .",
    "the analysis is complicated by several factors :    * the signal frequency and phase are not known in advance .",
    "* the signal frequency may not lie at an integer multiple of the rayleigh frequency @xmath0 .",
    "a signal of this type does not make an integer number of cycles during the observation time @xmath1 .",
    "we call such frequencies , and the corresponding signal , `` unresolved '' .",
    "* the signal frequency must be identified with resolution less than @xmath2 , i.e. , to within the nearest frequency bin .",
    "* the method must handle non - gaussian noise in an optimal manner .",
    "the analysis presented here addresses all of these concerns .",
    "the basic problem that we consider is the following .",
    "we are given @xmath3 samples of a time - domain data stream , sampled at discrete times @xmath4 .",
    "we denote this data by @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "the total observation time is @xmath7 .",
    "the question that we want to answer is , does the data stream @xmath5 contain a sinusoidal signal @xmath8 of constant amplitude in the amplitude of the cosine simplifies the form of the frequency - space pdf , while retaining the standard definitions of the dft . ] and frequency ? to address this question , we make use of the theory of optimal signal detection . it is convenient to recast the problem in the fourier domain . denote the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of the data . ] by @xmath9 : @xmath10 since this transformation is invertible , any question or statement about the @xmath11 s can also be stated in terms of the @xmath12 s , hence we will often use the term `` data '' to refer to the @xmath12 s rather than to the @xmath11 s . here , and elsewhere",
    ", the symbols @xmath12 and @xmath11 without indices refer to the collective ensemble of all the data . for convenience",
    "we will assume that @xmath3 is a power of two .",
    "the index @xmath13 will often be referred to as a `` frequency bin '' .",
    "the frequencies that these bins correspond to , @xmath14 are called `` resolved frequencies '' for reasons that will become clear later .    in what follows",
    ", we will assume that the data @xmath11 is real .",
    "in this case , @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes complex - conjugate , and both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real .",
    "the data set @xmath11 is then exactly equivalent to the set of @xmath9 for @xmath19 . to simplify the mathematics",
    ", we will assume that the average value of the @xmath11 s vanishes ( i.e. , that the dc or average value has been removed from the data ) so that @xmath20 .",
    "we will also assume that there is no energy at the nyquist frequency @xmath21 ( which in a real experiment would be enforced by appropriate anti - aliasing filters ) so that @xmath22 . then , the data set @xmath11 is exactly equivalent to the set @xmath9 for @xmath23 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath24 to denote the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the data , in the presence of a signal whose amplitude is @xmath25 . for example ,    * if the ( real and imaginary parts of the ) noise in each frequency bin is independent and gaussian with vanishing mean and unit variance , and the signal is a sinusoid of known phase at resolved frequency @xmath26 given by @xmath27 , then @xmath28 note that since @xmath29 is an integer , and @xmath25 is real , the signal only affects the @xmath29th frequency bin . * if the assumptions are the same as above , but the phase of the signal is unknown and uniformly distributed over the range @xmath30 , then @xmath31    somewhat later , we will relax these assumptions , and give more general forms for @xmath24 where    * the signal frequency is not a resolved frequency , * the noise is not white , and * the noise is not gaussian .    note that the integration measure for @xmath24 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the real and imaginary parts .",
    "the problem that we wish to solve is well - known in the theory of signal detection .",
    "the space of possible measurements @xmath9 for @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "our goal is to divide this space of possible measurements into two disjoint regions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , whose union is all of @xmath36 .",
    "if the observed data lies in @xmath37 ( the `` null - hypothesis region '' ) we will conclude that no signal was present in the data . if the data lies in @xmath38 , we will conclude that a signal was present .",
    "the problem we need to solve is this : what is the best choice of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ?",
    "the solution we chose is the neyman - pearson criterion : the best choice is the one that gives the lowest false dismissal probability for a given false alarm probability .",
    "the false alarm probability @xmath39 is the probability that a signal is detected when none is present : @xmath40 and the false dismissal probability @xmath41 is the probability that a signal of amplitude @xmath25 is not found : @xmath42 the neyman - pearson criteria leads immediately to the following rule to partition the space of possible measurements into @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "define the likelihood function on the space of possible measurements by @xmath43 and consider the surface @xmath44 .",
    "the neyman - pearson criteria leads to the following choice : take @xmath37 to be the region inside this surface , and @xmath38 to be the region outside this surface . the value of @xmath45 that defines the surface determines the false alarm and false dismissal probabilities .    in this paper , we will use the neyman - pearson criteria to define an `` optimal statistic '' which we will denote @xmath46 .",
    "this is any function of the observed data @xmath12 whose _ level surfaces _ are the same as the level surfaces of @xmath47 .",
    "if the statistic is greater than some threshold @xmath48 then we conclude that a signal is present , and if the statistic is less than the threshold @xmath48 we conclude that no signal was present .",
    "the false alarm and false dismissal probabilities are functions of this threshold @xmath48 : as @xmath48 is increased the false alarm probability gets smaller , and the false dismissal probability gets larger . in general",
    "this optimal statistic is a function of the signal amplitude @xmath25 .",
    "however we will see that for the pulsar detection problem , where @xmath25 is small , the optimal statistic is effectively @xmath25-independent .",
    "to help make these ideas concrete , we give a complete worked example , demonstrating these ideas for the second pdf described above : a signal of unknown phase at a resolved frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the pdf is @xmath49 before continuing , it is convenient to express this in closed form . writing the complex data sample @xmath50 in terms of its modulus @xmath51 and phase @xmath52 , one has @xmath53 the final integral has been expressed in terms of a modified bessel function @xmath54 of the first kind @xmath55 thus we obtain a closed form for the pdf ( [ e : gausspdf0 ] ) @xmath56 the likelihood function is now easily found : @xmath57 while in a general situation , the likelihood function depends upon all the different variables , in this particular situation it only depends upon @xmath51 .",
    "we defined an optimal statistic @xmath58 to be any function whose level surfaces are the same as the level surfaces of the likelihood function @xmath47 . in this simple situation ,",
    "the likelihood function @xmath59 only depends upon the modulus @xmath51 of the amplitude in a single ( the @xmath29th ) fourier bin . since it is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath51 , we can choose as an optimal statistic any monotonic function of @xmath51 , for example @xmath51 or @xmath60 . for historical and later convenience ,",
    "let us choose as our optimal statistic the function @xmath61 .",
    "this is the power in the @xmath29th bin .",
    "the mean value of this statistic , the power in the @xmath29th bin , is @xmath62 in the absence of a signal ( @xmath63 ) both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath64 contribute unity .    to complete the analysis of this example , we need to calculate the false alarm and false dismissal probabilities .",
    "we will define , for a given value of threshold @xmath48 , the regions @xmath37 and @xmath38 by : @xmath65 thus our choice of statistic gives a decision rule which has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "if the power in bin @xmath29 is greater than @xmath48 , we conclude that a signal was present .",
    "if not , we conclude that no signal was present .",
    "the false alarm probability ( [ e : alarmdef ] ) is easy to calculate .",
    "it is given by the following function of threshold @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath66 in this calculation , the transition from the 3rd to the 4th line is trivial because we integrate over the all the coordinates except for @xmath64 . in going from the 4th to the 5th line ,",
    "we have changed variables from real and imaginary parts , to polar coordinates .",
    "the false dismissal probability ( [ e : dismissdef ] ) , which depends both upon the signal amplitude @xmath25 and upon the value @xmath48 of the decision statistic threshold , is obtained with a similar calculation .",
    "@xmath67 this final integral can not be evaluated in closed form .",
    "however it is easy to check that the limit @xmath68 : if the threshold is set very large , then the false dismissal probability is unity . in a moment , we will study the behavior of @xmath69 in the weak - signal limit as @xmath70 .",
    "however , before this , it is instructive to study the false - alarm versus false - dismissal curves for this statistic .    the false alarm and false dismissal curves for this optimal detection statistic are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] .",
    "plotting @xmath69 as a function of @xmath39 provides a way of describing the optimal statistic which is completely independent of the actual choice of the statistic .",
    "is an optimal statistic .",
    "there are an infinite number of different choices possible .",
    "] however , the relationship between the threshold @xmath48 and the false alarm and false dismissal probability does depend upon the choice of optimal statistic . because this statistic has been chosen by the neyman - pearson criterion ,",
    "any other detection statistic that we choose will have poorer performance .",
    "thus , for a given signal amplitude @xmath25 , and for a given false alarm probability @xmath39 , any other detection statistic will have a larger false dismissal probability @xmath69 : it will lie above the illustrated curves .",
    "our primary interest is in very weak signals .",
    "for the pulsar detection problem , we will have @xmath71 , and will be operating on the threshold of detection where @xmath72 is only slightly smaller than unity . for such weak signals ,",
    "it is useful to define the quantity @xmath73 this may be considered either as a function of the threshold @xmath48 or as a function of the false alarm probability @xmath74 .",
    "this quantity @xmath75 is the difference between the detection probability when a signal is present , @xmath76 , and the false alarm probability @xmath39 .",
    "for example , for a very weak signal , the threshold might be set for a false alarm probability of @xmath77 . the false dismissal probability for this weak signal might be @xmath78 .",
    "thus , if no signal is present , the threshold will be exceeded @xmath77 of the time . if a signal is present , the threshold will be exceeded @xmath79 of the time .",
    "roughly speaking , the difference between these , @xmath80 , is the probability of the threshold being exceeded because the signal was present , rather than because of the detector noise .",
    "these weak - signal - limit curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] .    in the small-@xmath25 ( weak signal )",
    "limit , it is easy to obtain an approximate closed - form for @xmath69 . by substituting the power series representation of the bessel function , @xmath81 into eqn .",
    "( [ e : simplebeta ] ) and integrating term - by - term , one obtains @xmath82 \\\\ \\nonumber & & = -{1\\over 2}\\epsilon^2   \\alpha \\ln \\alpha \\left [   1 - { \\epsilon^2 \\over 8}(2+\\ln \\alpha )   \\right .",
    "\\\\   & & \\left .",
    "\\hspace{60pt}+ { \\epsilon^4 \\over 144 }   \\left (   6 + 6 \\ln \\alpha + ( \\ln \\alpha)^2 \\right ) + \\cdots \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] even at the lowest order in @xmath25 ( the first term in square brackets ) this is a very good approximation , as shown by the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] . at the next order ( the first two terms in square brackets ) the approximation is indistinguishable from the exact result in fig .  [ f : fig2 ]  the solid curves",
    "this simplifies matters enormously .",
    "although the statistics of the optimal detection strategy depends upon the signal amplitude @xmath25 , for small @xmath25 , this dependence is simple enough to be analytically approximated .",
    "the detection probability plays a key role in the significance of an observation . a hierarchical pulsar search hunts for peaks in the spectra coming from a set of @xmath83 sequential time series . for example",
    ", suppose each time series of length @xmath3 is one day long .",
    "three months of such data would correspond to @xmath84 .",
    "what choice of false alarm probability @xmath39 ( or equivalently , of detection threshold @xmath48 ) is optimal ?    this question is easily answered .",
    "one might guess that the best operating point is where the detection probability @xmath85 is maximized : in the weak signal case this is at a threshold of @xmath86 corresponding to a false alarm probability @xmath87 .",
    "however this is not correct . in the absence of signal ,",
    "each of the @xmath83 data sets is independent .",
    "the probability of detecting peaks in @xmath88 of the @xmath83 data sets is the same as the probability that a coin will come up heads @xmath88 times in @xmath83 flips ( if the probability of `` heads '' is the false alarm probability @xmath39 ) .",
    "this is given by the binomial distribution : @xmath89 thus , in the absence of a signal , the mean number of peaks is @xmath90 , and its variance is @xmath91 . in the presence of a signal ,",
    "the mean number of peaks registered is @xmath92 .",
    "a good way to choose a false alarm probability ( or threshold ) is to maximize the significance @xmath93 .",
    "this is @xmath94 the significance is easily calculated as a function of either @xmath39 or @xmath48 . in the weak - signal limit , it is @xmath95 the significance as a function of either @xmath96 or @xmath39 has a maximum at the threshold value @xmath97 corresponding to a false alarm probability of @xmath98 .",
    "the significance at this threshold / false alarm probability is @xmath99 .",
    "note that this exhibits the expected @xmath100 scaling in the number @xmath83 of spetra analyzed .",
    "we have numerically verified that this is the optimal statistic .",
    "section  [ s : worked ] found and analyzed the optimal ( i.e. neyman - pearson ) peak detection strategy . in this section , we carry out an identical analysis of a different ( hence non - optimal ) strategy . the main purpose is to illustrate a side - by - side comparison of different detection statistics .",
    "we will assume that the signal and noise satisfy the same assumptions as in section  [ s : worked ] , given by eqn .",
    "( [ e : gausspdf ] ) . there , we showed that the optimal detection strategy was to threshold on the power @xmath61 in the @xmath29th bin . here",
    ", we adopt a different detection strategy .",
    "we will say that a peak has been detected if and only if the power @xmath60 in the @xmath29th bin exceeds the threshold @xmath48 _ and _ is greater than the power in either of the neighboring frequency bins .",
    "this strategy looks for `` local peaks '' that exceed the threshold .    for this peak detection strategy , the detection region @xmath38",
    "is defined by latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the first and second derivatives of the function @xmath196 w.r.t .",
    "its arguments . using ( [ e :",
    "intdphi ] ) to evaluate the integral over @xmath221 , and ( [ e : definem ] ) to evaluate the integral over @xmath191 gives @xmath222 a good algebraic check is to verify that in the absence of a signal the mean value of this quantity vanishes .",
    "thus we arrive at the final result : the optimal weak - signal detection statistic in the non - gaussian case . leaving out the data - independent constant term , it is @xmath223 this reduces to the original expression ( [ e : defineopt ] ) in the gaussian case , where @xmath224 and @xmath225 . in the non - gaussian case ( refer to fig .  [",
    "f : fig6 ] ) the effect of the @xmath226 and @xmath227 terms is to `` clip '' or `` truncate '' the effects of outlier points .    this research was supported in part by nsf grant phy-9728704 and phy-0071028 , and by the max planck society ( albert einstein institute , potsdam ) .",
