    "the wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation or phase - integral approximation plays an important role in the solution of schrdinger equation in the case where a particle has low momentum and moves through a slowly varying potential and in the proof of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules.[1 - 3 ] this approximation method is based on the limit @xmath5 which was first considered as the classical limit of quantum theory by max planck who stated:@xmath6the classical theory can simply be characterized by the fact that the quantum of action becomes infinitesimally small.@xmath7[4 ] however , the fact that the diffraction and interference of , for example , the grains of sand do not really occur when they pass through slits can be properly explained by considering that the outer matter of a tiny grain of sand screens nearly completely the associated wave by the inner matter.[5 ] this proposed screening effect gives a logical description of transition from a quantum particle to a classical object and gives a general momentum - position uncertainty relation [ 6 ] : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the screening mass parameter defined by @xmath3 in which _",
    "m _ is the mass of the effective screening layer and _ m _ the total mass . for a spherical nanoparticle shown in fig.1 ,",
    "the corresponding screening size parameter is @xmath10 [ 6 ] .",
    "the thickness of the effective screening layer having quantum behavior is estimated to be a few nanometers .",
    "[ fig.1 ]    obviously the heisenberg uncertainty relation is only applicable to quantum particles ( @xmath9=1 ) , but not applicable to macroscopic objects ( @xmath11 ) and mesoscopic objects ( between ) .",
    "the fact that the momentum and position of a macroscopic object are measurable simultaneously with finite errors implies the limit @xmath12 instead of the formal limit @xmath0 .",
    "it seems to be silly to regard the universal fundamental physical constant @xmath1 as a variable quantity .",
    "we will thus propose a superseded version of the wkb approximation in the classical limit @xmath12 .",
    "this limit is proper and general , which , as will be seen below , corresponds to the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics .",
    "traditionally , the wave function in the wkb approximation is expanded in terms of @xmath1 , which is based on the planck limit @xmath5 . indeed , @xmath13",
    "joule - sec and the planck limit has no physical interpretation .",
    "now , using the limit @xmath12 instead of the planck limit for derivation of the approximation , we assume that the schrdinger equation of an object with an effective screening parameter @xmath9 moving through a one - dimensional potential @xmath14 is expressed by @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "this equation implies that the momentum operator now is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 in 3 dimensions ) .",
    "of course the energy operator correspondingly becomes @xmath19 .",
    "the equation also implies that the commutator @xmath20=i\\alpha \\hbar \\{x , p\\}=i\\alpha \\hbar$ ] in which @xmath21 is the poisson bracket of _ x _ and _ p _ and that the bohm quantum potential [ 7 ] approaches 0 when @xmath11 instead of @xmath5 . the approximate solution of the equation can be written in the form : @xmath22 which satisfies @xmath23 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to _",
    "x_. so , assuming @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath25 we now expand @xmath26 as a series in powers of @xmath27 : @xmath28 therefore we have @xmath29    @xmath30    thus eq.5 becomes @xmath31 equating coefficients of the same powers of @xmath27 on the left and right sides of the above equation , we get @xmath32    @xmath33    from eq.10 and eq.11 we have @xmath34    @xmath35    and hence get @xmath36 furthermore , we have the equations @xmath37",
    "@xmath38    and hence obtain @xmath39 similarly from @xmath40 it follows that @xmath41 and similarly for higher terms in @xmath27 .",
    "now we write the power series as follows @xmath42 this formulas is the same as that obtained from the original version of the wkb approximation when @xmath43 . evidently , this superseded version is general in the sense that it is applicable to not only quantum particles ( @xmath43 ) but also nanoparticles ( @xmath44 ) .    as well known , usually it is only necessary to take the first two terms of the above series . by using the equation @xmath45",
    "we can thus write @xmath46 in which the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined by boundary and normalization conditions .",
    "the difficulty that rises is that the wkb approximation becomes inapplicable at the classical returning points where @xmath49=0 , but the approximate wave functions near the points can be easily obtained from solving the schrdinger equation and hence the connection formula between the wkb wave functions and the approximate wave functions can be derived in the way shown in many textbooks on quantum mechanics , such as that by merzbacher [ 8 ] .",
    "this version shows that the quantization rules for nanoparticles can be achieved by substituting @xmath4 for @xmath1 in the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules of the old quantum theory .    in order to investigate the relation between classical and quantum mechanics ,",
    "we now write eq.3 as the following form : @xmath50 substituting this wave function into eq.2 and assuming @xmath51 , we get @xmath52",
    "when @xmath11 , it becomes the well known hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath53 in which @xmath54 is the action function of classical mechanics , so the limit @xmath11 corresponds to the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics .",
    "this point is vital for understanding quantum mechanics .",
    "a superseded version of the wkb approximation has been proposed in the classical limit @xmath55 where @xmath3 is the screening parameter of an object in which _",
    "m _ is the mass of the effective screening layer and _ m _ the total mass .",
    "this version is applicable to not only approximate solution of schrdinger equation of a quantum particle but also that of a nanoparticle .",
    "moreover , the version shows that the quantization rules for nanoparticles can be achieved by substituting @xmath4 for @xmath1 in the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules of the old quantum theory .",
    "most importantly , the version helps clarify the essential difference between classical and quantum realities and understand the transition from quantum to classical mechanics as well as quantum mechanics itself",
