    "the nucleon spin sum rule can be written in a heuristic way as : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin , respectively , and @xmath5 is the parton orbital angular momentum . in the late 80 s it was announced and confirmed from several experiments that the contribution carried by the quarks is @xmath6 of the nucleon spin @xcite . the purpose of this work is to estimate the gluon polarisation @xmath7 , which is deeply related with the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin .",
    "the spin dependent effects are measured experimentally using the helicity asymmetry @xmath8 defined as @xmath9 where ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) refer to the parallel and anti - parallel spin helicity configuration of the beam lepton ( @xmath12 ) with respect to the target nucleon ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) .",
    "the data for the present analyses was taken in the compass experiment @xcite .",
    "the gluon polarisation can be measured via the photon - gluon fusion ( pgf ) process , depicted in c ) , which allows to probe the spin of the gluon inside the nucleon .",
    "the pgf process may be selected using two analysis methods : ( i ) selecting high @xmath0 hadron events , or ( ii ) selecting events containing open charm mesons .",
    "scattering : a ) virtual photo - absorption ( lp ) , b ) gluon radiation ( qcd compton ) and c ) photon - gluon fusion ( pgf).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      in the high @xmath0 analysis the spin helicity asymmetry is calculated by selecting events containing high @xmath0 hadron pairs above @xmath15 and @xmath16 gev@xmath1 , respectively for the highest and the second highest @xmath0 hadron with respect the virtual photon direction . a cut on @xmath17 was also applied in order to select dis .",
    "two other processes compete with the pgf process in lo qcd approximation , namely the virtual photo - absorption leading order process ( lp ) and the gluon radiation ( qcd compton ) process , illustrated in .",
    "the spin helicity asymmetry for the high @xmath0 hadron pair data sample can thus be schematically written as : @xmath18 the process fractions are represented by @xmath19 , @xmath20 referring to the different processes .",
    "@xmath21 represents the partonic cross section asymmetries , @xmath22 , also known as analysing power .",
    "the depolarisation factor @xmath23 is the fraction of the muon beam polarisation transferred to the virtual photon .",
    "the virtual photon asymmetry @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "a similar equation to can be written to express the inclusive asymmetry of a data sample , @xmath26 . using for the high @xmath0 hadron pair sample and the above mentioned equation for the inclusive sample the final expression to extract the gluon polarisation",
    "is obtained : @xmath27 this formula corresponds to the spin helicity asymmetry @xmath28 , measured directly from data , plus a correcting asymmetry @xmath29 involving mainly the virtual photo - absorption and the gluon radiation processes .",
    "the @xmath30 factor relates the partonic asymmetries and the fractions of the involving processes . during the data selection process",
    "it is not possible to identify the process that originated each event , neither to access its partonic variables .",
    "therefore the partonic asymmetries and the process fractions need to be estimated using a dedicated and well tuned monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the quality of the simulation is illustrated by the comparison of the distributions for three variables in the presented at the conference slides . in the high @xmath0 analysis a bayesian neural network ( nn ) @xcite approach was used .",
    "the purpose of such approach is to assign a event probability for each process involved : lp , qcd compton and pgf .",
    "these probabilities represent the process fractions in . also the nn is used to provide the partonic asymmetries and @xmath31 and @xmath32 variables .",

    "a similar analysis was performed for the @xmath34 data , which contains @xmath35 of the whole @xmath36 range .",
    "this separation is due to the physical processes contained in the two @xmath36 regimes .",
    "the @xmath34 regime represents the quasi - real photon , in such conditions the photon may exhibit some inner structure .",
    "therefore beside the already mentioned three intervening processes the inclusion of photon structure processes in the mc simulation needs to be accomplished .",

    "in which the virtual photon strikes a parton inside the nucleon is reduced .",
    "in addition the backgroun is suppressed by selecting the @xmath39 channel . doing in this way three channels",

    "the data used in this analysis are deuteron data collected from 2002 to 2006 and proton data collected in 2007 .",

    "as in high @xmath0 analysis , the gluon polarisation calculation is performed event by event with an appropriate weight . still to solve this equation system the partonic asymmetry @xmath52 and the signal significance @xmath53 must be estimated for every event . to compute the partonic asymmetry @xmath52 a dedicated mc simulation is used .",
