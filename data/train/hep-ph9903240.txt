    "in a recent paper @xcite we have presented an explanation , from perturbative qcd , of the dijet rapidity gap events experimentally observed in @xmath0 scattering at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "these events consist of a pair of jets produced at very large momentum transfer , and separated by a wide empty region , where barely any particle multiplicity is measured .",
    "they were originally predicted from the exchange of at least two gluons in a color singlet configuration , which avoids color recombination between the jets and associated interjet hadronization @xcite .",
    "a quantitative formalism to describe gap events , however , has been lacking in the literature .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have discussed the dependence of the dijet cross section on the energy flow into the central region , clearly related to the observed particle multiplicity .",
    "we have shown how to factorize the partonic cross section into a hard scattering function , accounting for the dynamics of the highly virtual quanta exchanged in the scattering , and a soft function , describing the soft radiation emitted into the interjet region .",
    "both functions are defined as matrices in the space of the possible color flows at the hard scattering , formalizing the idea , already expressed by other authors , that the color structure of the short - distance partonic scattering is not uniquely defined @xcite .",
    "the soft function contains , at each order in perturbation theory , logarithms of the interjet radiation energy , which can be resummed , to give the dependence of the dijet cross section on the interjet energy flow .",
    "the resummation is driven by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a soft anomalous dimension matrix , defined in the space of color flows . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have performed the analysis of this matrix for @xmath1 scattering , which is the relevant partonic process in a valence quark approximation for @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the result indicates that , in the limit of a very large interjet region ( corresponding to a very large parton center of mass energy , compared to the momentum transfer ) , the color singlet component dominates , thus merging our picture , in this asymptotic configuration , with approaches to the problem based on the regge limit of qcd @xcite and on the idea of color singlet dominance @xcite .",
    "we have already pointed out that a full treatment of the tevatron dijet gap cross section requires us to include the contribution of processes involving gluons , which we postpone , for that specific problem , to forthcoming work @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will apply our method to analyze the photoproduction of two high transverse momentum jets with a large intermediate rapidity gap .",
    "events of this kind have been reported in @xmath2 collisions at hera @xcite . here , the quantity of interest is the gap fraction , the ratio of the number of dijet events with a large interjet gap , to the total number of dijet events .",
    "the zeus experiment shows that , binning the gap events according to the width of the interjet empty region , the gap fraction , after an initial decay , reaches an asymptotic plateau .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the fraction of gap events from the exchange of a color octet , reggeized gluon falls off exponentially with increasing gap width .",
    "the left - over asymptotic excess has been interpreted as the fraction of the color singlet exchange of a hard bfkl pomeron @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here that the bfkl approach is complementary to ours , because it deals with the resummation of gluonic radiation , which , in our language , would be described as hard ( see sec .",
    "[ results ] below ) .    applying the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite to this problem is especially interesting , because , while the data for the tevatron gaps show the dependence of the cross section on the interjet energy at fixed gap width , here we will explore the opposite dependence , variable gap width at fixed energy",
    ". we will show that the factorization and resummation of the soft gluonic energy emitted into the gap leads precisely to the behavior of the gap fraction observed by the experiment .",
    "in addition , photoproduction is an ideal process in which to analyze the contribution of gluons to gap cross sections .",
    "theoretical studies of jet photoproduction have been pursued since the early 80 s @xcite and are a very active area of research .",
    "the dominant partonic mechanisms in photoproduction are the direct and resolved scatterings : in the former case the photon from the incoming lepton interacts directly with the quark or gluon from the proton , and in the latter it fluctuates first into a hadronic state of low virtuality , acting as a source of partons , which then scatter off partons from the proton . the precise experimental determination of the partonic content of the photon is still an open problem , partly because it requires isolating the resolved component of the scattering @xcite . however ,",
    "existing data indicate that , especially at low values of partonic @xmath3 , the dominant component of the photon is gluonic @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we will see that for the resolved contribution , the scattering of a gluon from the photon with a quark from the proton is dominant in the kinematical region of interest .",
    "also the contribution from the resolved reaction @xmath4 has to be taken into account , although it turns out to be much less important in this case , because of the high transverse energy cuts experimentally imposed on the jets .",
    "one last important remark has to be made , about the issue of survival @xcite . in dijet gap events ,",
    "the survival probability is limited by the probability of no radiation inside the gap from the interaction of spectator partons .",
    "such probability is estimated to be of the order of @xmath5 in @xmath6 scattering , if we require a truly empty interjet region @xcite .",
    "presumably , for @xmath7 reactions the number of spectator quarks and gluons is reduced with respect to @xmath6 scattering , because of the partly leptonic nature of the initial state .",
    "therefore our resummed formula , which accounts for the amount of perturbative survival from soft gluon dynamics , should be less sensitive to these effects .    throughout the paper",

    "( [ crosdir ] ) and ( [ crosres ] ) .",
    "the underlying argument is that in the partonic scattering the soft gluon emission decouples from the dynamics of the hard scattering , and can be approximated by an effective cross section , in which each of the partons is treated as a recoilless source of gluonic radiation .",
    "formally , this is equivalent to replacing each parton with a path - ordered exponential of the gluon field ( eikonal or wilson line ) in the proper representation of @xmath50 , the fundamental representation @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) for quarks ( antiquarks ) , and the adjoint representation for gluons . in this way the hard amplitude is replaced by a sum of eikonal operators , @xmath53 , depending on color tensors @xmath54 , which account for the color flow at the hard scattering , times short - distance coefficient functions .",
