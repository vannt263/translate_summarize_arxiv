    "three - body recombination has attracted much theoretical and experimental research interest in recent years .",
    "recombination is the process in which three free particles collide to form a two - body state and a free particle , with the released kinetic energy being distributed between the final collisional partners .",
    "such reactions are common and important in chemical reactions and in atomic , molecular , and nuclear physics . in ultracold",
    "degenerate fermi gases @xcite recombination has been used as a process to form weakly bound diatomic states , crucial for the experimental realization of the bec - bcs crossover physics . in fact , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the use of recombination as an efficient way to produce weakly bound diatomic molecules can be extended to systems other than fermionic gases . for colliding becs at precisely - tuned relative velocity , the formation of molecules via 3-body recombination can also be used to form molecules efficiently owing to a double bose enhancement @xcite .",
    "recombination processes normally release a high amount of kinetic energy , producing atomic losses that often limit the lifetimes of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , three - body recombination has been recognized as one of the most important scattering observables in which features related to the universal efimov physics can be manifested @xcite .",
    "near a two - body feshbach resonance , i.e. , when the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 is much larger than the range @xmath2 of the interactions , efimov states can occur , causing interference and resonant effects in recombination .",
    "the experimental observation of these features in recombination has been recently used as evidence of efimov physics in ultracold quantum gases @xcite .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "quantitative calculations of recombination for the typical alkali atoms used in experiments in ultracold gases are limited by the large number of diatomic states existing in such systems .",
    "most of the available calculations for recombination for realistic systems have been confined to model systems possessing just a few bound states and/or systems with small scattering lengths , and even these are challenging calculations @xcite . as a result",
    ", recombination calculations relevant for ultracold gases can only be made in the universal regime @xmath3 , by using simple potential models ( with a few - bound states ) or else by simply modeling the decay into all deeply bound molecular states through a single inelastic parameter @xcite .",
    "however , in ultracold gases experiments the condition of universality is typically _ not _ deeply satisfied , making it desirable to perform more realistic calculations involving more sophisticated two - body models with , eventually , a larger number of deeply bound states .",
    "this paper develops a methodology within the hyperspherical adiabatic representation that permits the treatment of systems with many bound states .",
    "the present study still utilizes two - body potentials models that are , however , designed to support many bound states , and therefore mimic three - body collisions for more realistic scenarios . in the hyperspherical representation",
    ", the existence of many bound states leads to a complex set of sharp nonadiabatic avoided crossings in the hyperspherical potential curves at short distances .",
    "the large number of sharp avoided crossings creates numerical difficulties for the traditional adiabatic representation as formulated with @xmath4 couplings@xcite . to overcome these numerical difficulties ,",
    "one solution is to use the slow variable discretiazation ( svd ) method proposed by tolstikhin _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the svd method has been successfully applied to three - body bound - state calculations @xcite and three - body collisions for the @xmath5 system @xcite .",

    "( [ radialeq ] ) below ] out to large distances . to study ultracold collision processes such as recombination in the large scattering length limit ,",
    "it is crucial to solve the hyperradial equation out to very large distances .",
    "since application of svd over the entire space is demanding in terms of memory and cpu - time , it is in fact much more efficient to separate the domain of hyperradii into two regimes . at short distances , where many avoided crossings appear , the svd method is applied , while at large distances , where the adiabatic potential curves are smooth ,",
    "the traditional adiabatic method @xcite is utilized .",
    "this two - pronged strategy enables efficient calculation of the three - body recombination rate at low collision energy , with extremely stable results for a two - body potential model supporting up to about 10 bound states .",
    "this numerical capability of calculating recombination with many bound states permits us to study the final state distribution of the recombination rate , @xmath6 .",
    "one unexpectedly simple finding is that the branching ratio of recombination into a particular final ( @xmath7 ) channel , defined as @xmath8 is the _ same _ for different initial ( @xmath9 ) three - body collision channels . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath10 is the partial recombination from the initial three - body channel @xmath9 to a particular final channel @xmath7 .",
    "the threshold laws for the partial recombination rates have also been considered , i.e. , recombination processes occurring from excited three - body continua .",
    "these partial rates are observed to deviate from the usual wigner threshold law .",
    "specifically , the energy dependence of the partial recombination rates display a much weaker suppression than the usual wigner analysis @xcite for excited continuum channels .",
    "these numerical results can be interpreted as the manifestation of a strong coupling between three - body continuum channels .",
    "this is further quantified through a perturbation series expansion of the scattering matrix that reveals the three - body recombination pathways at low collision energies .",

    "this recombination pathway also explains why the relative recombination rate to reach the same final recombination channel from different incident three - body channels is the same . for ultracold collisions triggered from every excited three - body incidence channel ( @xmath207 )",
    ", our analysis shows that the final state contribution for recombination is mainly controlled by the coupling between the lowest three - body break - up channel at short distances .",
    "therefore , the corresponding relative final state contribution are independent of the initial excited three - body channel .",
    "the methodology elaborated in this paper is capable of calculating recombination rate and , similarly , any other three - body scattering observable for systems that possess many two - body bound states .",
    "our numerical study was performed for systems with up to 10 bound states , but it can be extended to larger problems with a good level of accuracy . although our calculations for larger systems might be limited by memory usage and cpu time , our approach still allows for the analysis of increasingly more complex systems .",
    "a key outcome is an understanding of the modified threshold laws for partial channel contributions to three - body recombination of three identical bosons with angular momentum @xmath137 .",
    "our analysis for the important recombination pathways reveals that the threshold behavior of the recombination rate for excited three - body incidence channels is significantly less suppressed at low energy than a simple generalization of the wigner s threshold laws predicts .",
    "in addition , the branching ratio of recombination into any given final state @xmath7 is found to be the same for different incident channels .",

    "we thank yujun wang and brett esry for helpful discussions of numerous issues relevant to the present study .",
    "the present model described in the main text uses the traditional adiabatic approach combined with an r - matrix propagation method for large values of @xmath13 , where the @xmath218 and @xmath219 matrices are smooth functions of @xmath13 .",
    "one advantage of using this representation is that instead of calculating the values of the @xmath218 and @xmath219 matrices at every mesh point in @xmath13 , we can solve the hyperangular part of the hamiltonian at relatively fewer grid points .",
    "( the number of grid points is generally set by the characteristic wave length associated with the collision energy . )",
    "this , therefore , allows the use of interpolation and/or extrapolation methods in order to generate the required much denser grid without memory storage problems .",
