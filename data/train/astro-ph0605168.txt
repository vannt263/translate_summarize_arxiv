    "the _ fuse _ instrument consists of four independent optical paths .",
    "two employ lif - coated gratings and mirrors that are sensitive to the wavelengths between 990 and 1187 , and two use sic coatings that are sensitive to wavelengths between 905 and 1100 .",
    "each spectrograph possesses three apertures that simultaneously observe different parts of the sky .",
    "the low resolution ( lwrs ) aperture samples an area of @xmath8 .",
    "the medium resolution ( mdrs ) aperture spans @xmath9 and lies about @xmath10 from the lwrs aperture .",
    "the high resolution ( hirs ) aperture lies between the mdrs and lwrs apertures ( about @xmath11 from the lwrs aperture ) and samples an area @xmath12 wide .",
    "a complete description of _ fuse _ can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data used in our survey consist of lif1a lwrs spectra from the s405 and z907 programs ( as of 2003 july 25 ) taken in time - tag mode .",
    "the s405 programs represent background observations and observations for alignment of the four optical paths .",
    "the z907 programs contain observations of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and other extragalactic targets that can be used as background sources for absorption studies . in some cases , these targets were too faint for use as background sources , which resulted in relatively flat continua suited for the search of galactic emission .",
    "in addition to these two programs , we searched the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ; as of 2003 july 25 ) for mdrs observations of point sources obtained in time - tag mode , as their lwrs apertures should sample only background radiation .",
    "if hirs time - tag observations exist in addition to the mdrs observations of a target , the corresponding lwrs spectra of both mdrs and hirs observations were combined into one spectrum . when combining lwrs data from hirs and mdrs observations obtained at different epochs , we ignored the fact that the lwrs aperture may sample slightly different regions of the sky depending on the aperture and position angle used for the observations . at worst",
    ", this simplification decreases the spatial resolution of our data from 30 arcsec ( the width of the lwrs aperture ) to 7 arcmin ( twice the distance between lwrs and mdrs aperture ) .",
    "the sample was further modified as follows : all extracted lwrs spectra that showed continuum flux were removed from the survey .",
    "we also removed sight lines whose emission could be identified as originating in the supernova remnants vela or the cygnus loop , since these structures do not represent the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "sight lines passing within a few arc minutes of the hot white dwarf kpd  0005 + 511 exhibit unusually strong emission ( up to 25,000lu ) .",
    "we determined that the emission from this region originates in a high - ionization planetary nebula ( hipn ) around the white dwarf ( otte , dixon , & sankrit 2004 ) , and therefore removed all observations toward this object from the survey .",

    "the low temperature of wd  0455 - 282 ( @xmath18k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , makes the photoionization of the circumstellar material to high ionization levels such as difficult . while we can not rule out the possibility of a hipn around wd  0455 - 282 , we include p10411 in our sample of diffuse emission",

    "five of our sight lines lie within 5  of the ecliptic plane , where solar emission scattered off interplanetary dust is a concern , but we have found no evidence for such contamination in the data .",

    "the atmosphere of jupiter consists primarily of h@xmath22 .",
    "while there is a possibility that the observed emission comes from h@xmath22 fluorescence excited by solar emission , the absence of other h@xmath22 emission lines and the 35 separation between the mdrs and the lwrs aperture argue against this possibility .",
    "the other four sight lines in the ecliptic plane show no emission .",
    "sight line p10413 ( @xmath23 ) is a science observation with capella in the mdrs aperture .",
    "the stellar spectrum shows strong emission lines with a possible contamination of the hirs and lwrs aperture .",
    "the measured velocity of the emission line in the lwrs aperture , however , is inconsistent with the radial velocities of either star in this spectroscopic binary during the orbital phase at the time of the _ fuse _ observations @xcite .",
    "in a few cases , we combined into a single spectrum sight lines that are separated by less than @xmath24 to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "table [ obsid ] lists the target ids ( usually the first 68 characters of the observation i d ) by which we identify the sight lines in this survey and the observations that contribute to each .",
    "the original sample contained 225 sight lines , of which 77 were removed because of continuum flux or even absorption features in the lwrs aperture ; 16 more sight lines were removed because of snr or hipn emission .",
    "another 16 sight lines were combined with nearby sight lines , and four observations turned out not to contain any night time data .",
    "the final survey contains 112 sight lines unevenly distributed on the sky ( fig.[pos ] ) .",
    "the apparent clustering of observations in two quadrants can be explained by observational constraints that combine to reduce target availability around the orbital plane , which stretches across the galactic center .",
    "in several cases , observations of the same target were repeated months or even years apart . using the calfuse pipeline to combine",
    "these time - tag observations can yield faulty wavelength and thus velocity information .",
    "we developed software in idl to optimize the extraction of the emission from the lif1a channel by calibrating each exposure individually in wavelength ( using airglow lines ) and flux before combining them into one spectrum .",
    "we used the raw data and applied the first steps of the calfuse pipline ( version 2.3 ; initializing the header , computing doppler corrections ) .",
    "our idl program then extracted all photons that were detected in a rectangular area around the expected location of in the lwrs spectrum .",
    "this rectangular region was determined from the data set s4054801 , a very long background observation .",
    "the lwrs spectrum was collapsed perpendicular to the wavelength dispersion axis to create a one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the s4054801 data yielded the template positions of the five airglow lines ( @xmath251027.431 , 1028.157 , 1039.230 , 1040.943 , and 1041.688 ) surrounding the @xmath251032,1038 doublet .",
    "the strongest of these airglow lines is @xmath01027 .",
    "our idl program searched for an emission line in each individual exposure in a 160 pixel wide window around the @xmath01027 template position and fitted its position with a gaussian profile .    in the next step ,",
    "the program used the first fitted position and the template offsets between the airglow lines to search for the remaining four emission lines and to fit their positions .",
    "the airglow fits were then compared with empirical criteria for good airglow fits .",
    "the three criteria are ( 1 ) the ratio of the fitted peak intensity over the continuum noise should be @xmath26 . ( 2 )",
    "the fitted gaussian line width should be @xmath27 and @xmath28 pixels .",
    "( 3 ) the fitted position of each airglow line should be less than 15 pixels from its expected position relative to the measured @xmath01027 line .",
    "airglow lines not fulfilling all three criteria were marked as bad and not considered further .",
    "an intensity - weighted average offset from the template positions was calculated for each exposure . for exposures without any good airglow lines , average offsets were determined by interpolation between the measured offsets of the exposures closest in time before and after the exposure in question .",
    "the next step was to determine the correction factor for the time - dependent effective area for each exposure and to shift each exposure according to its average offset from the template .",
    "the spectra were then combined , and the airglow lines were fitted once more in the combined , higher signal - to - noise spectrum .",
    "the airglow line fits were again compared with the criteria for good fits .",
    "the good fits were used to determine the geocentric wavelength solution , which was assumed to be linear in the emission region .",
    "the differences between the standard calfuse wavelength calibration and our linear wavelength solutions are less than 0.02 around @xmath29 .",
    "if no good airglow lines were found in the combined spectrum , the template positions were used .",
    "shifts in wavelength caused by grating or mirror motions on orbital timescales are not corrected in this case .",
    "the only five sight lines without good airglow lines were non - detections and therefore did not require additional correction .",
    "if only one good airglow line was found , it was used to determine an offset from the template positions and their wavelength solution .",
    "all necessary correction factors , shifts , and wavelength solutions were saved , so that they could be applied in the second and final extraction of the spectra .    for each sight line ,",
    "a day - plus - night and a night - only spectrum were finally extracted . to create these spectra ,",
    "the uncorrected exposures were used to extract the photons of the lif1a lwrs aperture according to their day / night flag .",
    "pulse height limits 225 were used , since this range appears suited for all observations taken between 1999 ( launch ) and 2003 ( start of our survey work ) .",
    "the extracted region of detector segment 1a was collapsed perpendicular to the dispersion axis to create the one - dimensional day - plus - night and night - only spectrum .",
    "both the day - plus - night and the night - only spectra of each exposure were shifted by the previously determined offset and adjusted to a heliocentric wavelength scale for each spectrum .",
    "the spectra were corrected for the time - dependent effective area by the factor calculated previously , and then combined into one day - plus - night and one night - only spectrum for each sight line .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra were binned by 16 pixels ( @xmath30 ) and saved as ascii tables .",
    "further data analysis was performed on the night - only spectra to avoid contamination of the measurements with possible airglow emission ; the day - plus - night spectra were used only to assist , e.g. , in the identification of possible continuum absorption features .",
    "we distinguished between detections and non - detections solely by the spectrum s appearance , i.e. , no automated detection algorithm was used .",
    "thus , our measurements include mostly sight lines with at least 2@xmath31 detections .",
    "each detection spectrum was fitted twice using the iraf routine specfit @xcite . before fitting the data , we smoothed the error array slightly to avoid pixels with a flux error of zero . if the average continuum count per pixel in the measurement region was too low ( i.e. , @xmath32cts / pxl ) , we binned the spectrum by an additional factor of two .",
    "we first calculated the reduced @xmath33 value for a linear continuum fit to the entire measurement region from 1028.5 to 1036.5 .",
    "the second fit ( yielding @xmath34 ) included an emission line model consisting of a convolution of a gaussian profile with a 106kms@xmath1 wide flat - top profile ( representing the lwrs aperture ) .",
    "we used the routine mpftest from the markwardt idl library to perform the standard f test ( @xmath35/[\\chi^2/\\nu]$ ] ) on each detection spectrum to obtain a confidence level for the existence of the @xmath01032 emission line .",
    "figure [ ft ] compares the confidence level @xmath36 with the ratio of the measured intensity to its uncertainty @xmath37 .",
    "only three sight lines have a signal - to - noise ratio significantly lower than 3.0 ( i.e. , less than 2.5 ) .",
    "only one of these sight lines also has a confidence level below 60% ( s40523 ) .",
    "since the emission line along sight line s40523 is stronger than any possible emission feature in our non - detection sight lines , we kept s40523 as a detection , but with the caveat of its higher uncertainty .",
    "the analysis was performed on detections with @xmath38 , which corresponds to a 99.3% confidence level , unless noted otherwise .",
    "( including the lower signal - to - noise detections would change the quoted means , uncertainties , and standard deviations in the subsequent paragraphs by only 100lu . )    three - sigma upper limits for @xmath01032 non - detections were derived from the standard deviation in the continuum counts , which we will discuss in more detail in   [ dlim ] .",
    "no background subtraction was applied , i.e. , the continuum includes any detector background and its uncertainty . following the arguments of @xcite",
    ", we were able to exclude contamination of the detections by stray light or scattered solar emission .",
    "both emission and absorption lines of molecular hydrogen can change the appearance of the @xmath01032 emission line .",
    "the two closest h@xmath22 absorption lines are from the transitions lyman ( 6,0 ) @xmath39 @xmath01031.19 and @xmath40 @xmath01032.35 .",
    "we believe , however , that their effect on @xmath01032 is negligible , as these are weak transitions in the cold phase of the interstellar medium @xcite .",

    "neither one was observed in any of our sight lines , thus making h@xmath22 contamination of the @xmath01032 emission negligible .",

    "figure [ uplsp ] shows the first ten non - detection sight lines ; the complete figure is available electronically .    table [ det ] lists only the statistical uncertainties in our measurements . the uncertainty in the size of the lwrs aperture and the sensitivity of the instrument add a systematic uncertainty of about 14% @xcite to the numbers in table [ det ] .",
    "we checked the detections for possible wavelength shifts caused by grating / mirror motion between day and night observations .",

    "these wavelength shifts are within the uncertainties of the measured @xmath01032 wavelengths , i.e. , we can not distinguish whether a true mirror / grating motion occured between orbital day and night .",
    "the measured intensities can be corrected for extinction using the @xmath51 values derived by @xcite and the extinction parameterization of @xcite for a @xmath60 model .",
    "the resulting attenuation along all sight lines is at least 10% .",
    "we will discuss extinction in more detail in  [ dis ] .",
    "resonance scattering within the -bearing gas can also have a strong effect on the intensities . for optically thin gas , the intensity ratio @xmath61 , whereas optically thick plasma yields a ratio of unity . absorption by and h@xmath22 can modify the intensity ratio even further . since the @xmath01038 line is generally difficult to measure ( as mentioned above ) and its intensity has a large uncertainty , the resulting line ratio is usually inconclusive .",

    "inclusion of the previously published intensities ( table [ pub ] ) yields an average of @xmath63lu and a sd of 1700lu .",
    "this raises the question : how faint an emission line can be detected with",

    "no background sources are required , allowing us to search for emission in any direction of the sky .",
    "the picture of the emitting gas that arises in the following paragraphs is consistent with that derived from the absorption studies : the bearing gas forms a thick disk with emission originating most likely from interface regions in the thin disk and from cooling gas at higher latitudes .",
    "measurements of both absorption and emission along a given line of sight provide valuable diagnostics .",
    "the absorption is proportional to the density of the gas , while the emission is proportional to the square of the density . if one makes the simplifying assumption that the same gas is responsible for both absorption and emission , their ratio can be used to determine the electron density in the gas @xcite .",
    "the best case in our sample for comparing emission and absorption measurements would be sight line p10411 ( @xmath13 ) , as it lies only 35 from wd  0455 - 282 , which was included in the absorption survey of @xcite .",

    "if the observed emission is indeed of circumstellar origin as mentioned in ",
    "[ sam ] , it could be part of a hipn .    finding suitable pairs of emission / absorption measurements",

    "intensities are lowest for the halo sight lines and highest for the disk gas that exhibits h@xmath53 features .",
    "the halo sight lines clearly occupy a distinct area in fig .",
    "including the sight lines for which no wham data exist yields an average intensity toward h@xmath53 structures in the disk of @xmath87lu ( sd : 2100lu ) and , for diffuse gas , @xmath88lu ( sd : 1400lu ) in the disk and @xmath89lu ( sd : 800lu ) in the halo .    the _ fuse _ and wham instruments possess different velocity resolutions ( 106kms@xmath1 for the _ fuse _ lwrs aperture , 2kms@xmath1 for wham ) .",
    "most of the h@xmath53 emission falls within one resolution element of the _ fuse _ observation .",
    "we therefore can not distinguish individual components in the line profile ; only the bulk emission can be compared in the velocity range covered by wham ( @xmath90kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "of the 14 sight lines for which wham data exist , the emission line fully overlaps the h@xmath53 emission in 11 of them .",
    "eight of these show differences between the and h@xmath53 emission line centers of less than 25kms@xmath1 .",
    "the remaining three sight lines exhibit differences between 35 and 60kms@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the and h@xmath53 emission features appear to have similar velocities along 2/3 of the sight lines ( where data are available ) , but _",
    "fuse _ lacks the velocity resolution to conclude how much of the h@xmath53 emission originates in the same cloud as the emission .",
    "several comparisons between model predictions and observed column densities of high - ionization species like and have been published ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "very few models , unfortunately , make predictions about emission . under the simplifying assumption that all of the and h@xmath53 emission along each sight line originates in the same gas cloud , we compared their intensities with those predicted by models of turbulent mixing layers ( tml ) and cooling galactic fountain gas .",
    "slavin , shull , & begelman ( 1993 ) give and h@xmath53 intensities for tml models of different abundances , temperatures , and velocities .",
    "the predicted h@xmath53 intensities vary between 35 and 800lu , the intensities go up to about 12lu .",
    "this means that the predicted tml intensities are several orders of magnitude smaller than the observed ones .",
    "benjamin & shapiro ( 1996 , private communication ) predict h@xmath53 intensities for clouds of various sizes of cooling galactic fountain gas between 2 and @xmath91lu , which is the intensity range covered by our halo sight lines .",
    "the corresponding intensities , however , are between 2 and @xmath92lu , i.e. about ten times higher than the observed intensities of the halo sight lines . correcting the observations for the low attenuation toward the halo can not explain this discrepancy .",
    "a single model therefore can not explain the observed intensities .",
    "absorption line studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also concluded that mixed models are necessary to explain the observed column densities .      one possible origin of the emission is gas cooling from temperatures of @xmath93k or more .",
    "such hot gas is observable in the sxr regime . in fig.[sxr ] , we compare the measured @xmath01032 intensities with the _ rosat _ 1/4kev sxr emission .",
    "two of the detections of table [ pub ] ( sl1 and sl2 ) are not included in the plot , as their unusually strong sxr emission probably includes emission from the galaxy clusters located in these directions .",
    "if we divide the sxr data from tables [ det ] and [ pub ] ( excluding sl1 and sl2 ) into three bins with an equal number of sight lines , the resulting bins cover the sxr intensity ranges @xmath94 , 600899 , and @xmath95ru ( _ rosat _ unit ; 1ru = @xmath96  counts  s@xmath1arcmin@xmath97 ) .",
    "the mean intensities for each bin are @xmath98lu ( sd : 2100lu ) , @xmath99lu ( sd : 1700lu ) , and @xmath100lu ( sd : 1200lu ) .",
    "although the scatter in the data is large , there appears to be a decrease in intensity in the regions of strongest sxr emission . if we divide the sight lines again into the three categories mentioned in   [ hac ] ( disk gas with and without h@xmath53 features , diffuse halo gas ) and",
    "exclude sl1 and sl2 , the sxr intensities are @xmath101 , and @xmath102ru with sds of 260 , 220 , and 110ru , respectively .",
    "the average intensity of this sample of halo sight lines is @xmath103lu with a sd of 900lu , i.e. , only slightly different from the value mentioned in   [ hac ] .",
    "again , the areas of strongest sxr emission exhibit the lowest intensities .    @xcite computed spectra emitted by hot ( @xmath104k ) , optically thin gas for the x - ray and ultraviolet wavelength regime assuming collisional ionization equilibrium",
    ". we derived sxr and intensities from their tables for various temperatures and emission measures ( using a conversion factor of @xmath105ergs@xmath62count@xmath1 for the _ rosat _ sxr counts ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "observations along the sight lines probing diffuse gas in the disk lie mostly in the central part of the parameter space in fig .",
    "[ sxr ] , while the observations toward the halo occupy the high sxr / low intensity region .",
    "a comparison between the model by @xcite and the data is problematic mainly for three reasons : 1 ) the model assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium does not apply to cooling and possibly condensing galactic fountain gas .",
    "2 ) the observed data in the disk are affected by attenuation , a correction of which may change the distribution of the data points in fig .",
    "while attenuation certainly has an effect on the lower latitude sight lines ( see   [ tau ] below ) , it can not explain the drop in emission for the halo sight lines .",
    "3 ) the sxr intensities contain a contribution from the local bubble , whereas the amount of emission from the local bubble is still being debated . despite these drawbacks in our comparison , however , it is comforting to see that the predicted and observed intensities are of the same order of magnitude  unlike the models in the h@xmath53 comparison in  [ hac ] above .",
    "table [ det ] includes the local - standard - of - rest velocities @xmath49 for all @xmath01032 detections . to compare these velocities with galactic rotation",
    ", we adopted a simple rotation model , a differentially corotating halo with a constant velocity of @xmath108kms@xmath1 .",
    "we derived the distance @xmath109 along the line of sight to the emitting gas and its height @xmath110 above the galactic plane from the match between the model and the measured velocity .",
    "the values for @xmath110 and @xmath109 derived from our model are listed in table [ locs ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainties in @xmath110 and @xmath109 are based on the overlap between the 1@xmath31 uncertainties of the measured velocities and the velocities allowed by the corotation model .",
    "if a match between the measured velocity and the model exists only within the uncertainty of the velocity , the values for @xmath110 and @xmath109 are quoted as ranges . for sight lines with @xmath111 or @xmath112",
    ", two solutions might exist for a part of or the full 1@xmath31 range , as the velocity contours of the corotation model loop around inside the solar orbit around the galactic center .",
    "there are a handful of sight lines for which no solution exists within the observed 1@xmath31 range .",
    "two sight lines yield solutions up to the end of the galactic disk / halo ( represented by question marks in table [ locs ] , since the `` exact '' end of the disk / halo is not known ) .",
    "figure [ velp ] shows the model velocity profiles , the measured velocities , and their uncertainty ranges for three survey detection sight lines as an example .",
    "the model velocities were always calculated for @xmath113kpc without consideration of the direction of the sight line .",
    "the measured velocities of seven of the 23 sight lines are inconsistent with the corotating halo model ( e.g. , measured @xmath114 in @xmath115 region or vice versa ) .",
    "the other sight lines ( about 2/3 of the detection sight lines ) yield solutions of various likelihoods .",
    "these depend on the probability of the observed velocity and the derived values for @xmath116 and @xmath109 with regard to the expected extinction along and the direction of the sight line . for sight lines with two solutions , for example",
    ", the first listed solution is usually more likely due to the higher extinction along the longer path length and the larger ( and sometimes unreasonable ) values for @xmath116 or @xmath109 of the second solution .",
    "the comment in table [ locs ] takes these probabilities into account and describes what we believe is the likely range of the corotating , emitting gas .",
    "we define `` local '' as @xmath117pc , `` near '' as @xmath118kpc , and ( thick ) disk gas as @xmath119kpc .",
    "all sight lines yielding solutions for the corotation model place the emitting gas in the near disk , in a few cases even in the local environment .",
    "none of the sight lines yields only a halo solution ( with halo now defined as @xmath120kpc ) without a near disk solution .",
    "the measured velocities vary particularly strongly toward the northern galactic pole ( @xmath121 ) . combining the detections of tables [ det ] and [ pub ] , we find five sight lines that fall into that region : s40581 ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) , s40508 ( @xmath124 ) , sl1 , sl2 , and sl4 .",
    "positive as well as negative @xmath01032 velocities are measured in this direction , suggesting that turbulence , outflow , and infall play an important role in the distribution of the -emitting gas .",
    "one caveat , however , is the low spectral resolution of our 106kms@xmath1 wide aperture , which would be unable to resolve the emission from multiple clouds along the line of sight ( due to the strong binning of the data ) .",
    "if multiple clouds were present , the derived values for @xmath49 would represent an average for each sight line .",
    "a large number of high - velocity ( @xmath125kms@xmath1 ) components was detected in the absorption survey of @xcite .",
    "the majority of these components was observed toward high - velocity 21 cm emission . using the maps of high - velocity gas in ( * ? ? ?",

    "16 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "11 ) , we identified the sight lines in our emission survey that intersect hvcs .",
    "almost half of the sight lines in our survey ( 52 out of 112 ) pass regions of high - velocity gas , yet of the 23 sight lines showing emission , only five intersect hvcs ( all with @xmath38 ) . in none of these cases",
    "do the measured and velocities agree ( @xmath126kms@xmath1 ) ; however , we have found one region of the sky that exhibits emission and absorption at similar velocities .",
    "sight line s40521 ( @xmath127 , @xmath123 ) shows a weak emission line at @xmath128kms@xmath1 .",
    "three nearby absorption sight lines , mrk1513 , mrk304 , and ugc12163 , exhibit high - velocity components at @xmath129 and @xmath130kms@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "@xcite identify this region as an extension of the magellanic stream .",
    "except for this region of the magellanic stream , our survey does not contain any sight lines near hvcs originally detected in high - ionization species such as or and studied by @xcite and collins , shull , & giroux ( 2005 ) . detecting emission from hvcs",
    "appears more difficult than detecting diffuse emission  given the fact that none of the 52 sight lines that pass regions of hvcs exhibits emission from the hvc . in their extended survey , @xcite found two ( of a total of 183 ) sight lines with high - velocity emission matching the high - velocity emission .      when analyzing emission measurements in the ultraviolet , it is important to consider the effects of interstellar extinction .",
    "a plot of the color excess @xmath51 versus @xmath131 ( where @xmath44 is the galactic latitude ) for sight lines showing emission is presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the sharp decrease in dust extinction with galactic latitude is obvious .",
    "the high color excess at low latitudes suggests strongly that the emission is local ( that is , closer than the obscuring dust ) .",
    "the observed @xmath01032 intensities are plotted against @xmath132 in the lower panel of fig .",
    "for the nine high signal - to - noise sight lines with @xmath133 , the average intensity is @xmath134lu ( sd : 1800lu ) .",
    "for the 11 sight lines with @xmath135 , the average intensity is @xmath136lu ( sd : 1800lu ) .",
    "for the seven remaining sight lines , with @xmath137 , the average intensity is @xmath89lu ( sd : 800lu ) .",
    "we see that , at high latitudes , the intensities are lower and the dispersion decreases .",
    "based on these plots , we divide our sample into low - latitude , mid - latitude , and high - latitude sight lines . while both extinction and observed intensity fall with increasing galactic latitude for our complete sample , within each group we see no correlation of the observed intensity with reddening .",
    "the relatively low dispersion in the intensities of our high - latitude sight lines suggests that they sample gas with a uniform set of properties .",
    "the emission observed at these latitudes is thus likely to be from hot gas in the thick disk / halo .",
    "the low - latitude sight lines are significantly brighter than at higher latitudes , even though their extinction is higher ; hence , the low - latitude emission must come from nearby regions , probably interfaces in the thin disk , as suggested by the absorption data .",
    "the average intensity for the mid - latitude sight lines lies between the averages for the high and low - latitude sight lines .",
    "this is simply explained if at these latitudes the sight lines pass through both nearby emission interfaces and more distant in the thick disk .",
    "the dispersion then reflects the clumpiness of the hot gas in the galaxy .",
    "we have examined 112 sight lines from the _ fuse _ archive that probe diffuse , hot gas in the milky way and found 23 that exhibit @xmath01032 emission .",
    "sight lines crossing morphological features like h@xmath53 filaments or bubbles in the disk exhibit the strongest emission .",
    "halo sight lines show the lowest and h@xmath53 intensities , the strongest sxr emission , and little or no h@xmath53 structure .",
    "this suggests that different mechanisms are at work in areas that show morphological features as opposed to purely diffuse gas .",
    "higher intensities toward h@xmath53 filaments and bubbles indicate that the emission originates in interfaces or turbulent mixing layers .",
    "neither tml nor galactic fountain models can reproduce the observed intensities .",
    "data derived from computed thermal x - ray / uv spectra , however , are consistent with our observations for a range of emission measures and temperatures .",
    "about 2/3 of our detection sight lines probe clouds whose",
    "velocities are consistent with a corotating halo , placing the emitting gas most likely within a few kpc in the thick disk , if not locally within only a few 100pc from the sun . sight lines toward the northern galactic pole ( @xmath121 ) show velocities that differ from the corotation model and indicate turbulences , outflows , or infall of gas .",
    "none of our sight lines shows emission originating in hvcs .",
    "only one sight line possesses emission coinciding with the detection of high - velocity absorption toward the extension of the magellanic stream .",
    "combined with values from the literature , the intensities from our survey exhibit a variation with latitude that is consistent with the picture derived from recent absorption measurements : high - latitude sight lines probe -emitting gas in a clumpy , thick disk , while low - latitude sight lines sample mostly mixing layers and interfaces in the thin disk of the galaxy . by combining intensities with column densities derived from absorption - line surveys",
    ", we can constrain the local density and physical scale of the emitting gas .",
    "the challenge is finding suitable emission / absorption measurements due to the clumpy nature of the -bearing gas .",
    "theoretical models of this phase of the interstellar medium in the galaxy must reproduce both the large - scale distribution of emission and the small - scale microphysics derived from emission and absorption surveys .",
