    "the dense plasma state is a common phase of matter in the universe and can be found in all types of stars  @xcite and within giant planets  @xcite .",
    "dense plasmas are commonly created during experiments involving high - power light sources such as , e.g. , the national ignition facility  @xcite , and recently developed x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfels ) lcls  @xcite and sacla  @xcite . in dense plasmas , free electrons stay in the close vicinity of ions .",
    "the ions then can not any longer be treated as isolated species , as the screening by the dense environment shifts their atomic energy levels , leading to a reduction of the ionization potentials .",
    "this effect is known as ionization potential depression ( ipd ) .",
    "quantitative predictions of this effect are of crucial importance for a correct understanding and accurate modeling of any atomic processes occurring within a dense plasma environment  @xcite , i.e. , for studies on warm dense matter  @xcite , shock experiments  @xcite , planetary science  @xcite , inertial confinement fusion  @xcite and studies of non - equilibrium plasmas created with xfels  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models have been developed to describe the ipd effect .",
    "an early development was the model proposed by ecker and krll ( ek )  @xcite for strongly coupled plasma , later extended to the weakly coupled regime by stewart and pyatt ( sp )  @xcite ( for more examples , see ref .",
    "however , until recently there were no experimental data available to verify the accuracy of these models whose predictions sometimes differed extensively .",
    "first experiments on the screening effect of plasma on atoms embedded in the plasma have been performed at lcls  @xcite .",
    "xfels provide radiation of extremely high peak brightness and pulse duration shorter or comparable with the characteristic times of the electron and ion dynamics within irradiated systems .",
    "the dense electronic systems can quickly thermalize via electron ",
    "electron collisions and impact ionization processes  @xcite .",
    "because of the ultrashort pulse duration ( typically tens of femtoseconds ) , only a thermalized electron plasma is probed while the ions still remain cold .",
    "this provides access to the properties of a solid - density material at temperature of @xmath0@xmath1  k ( @xmath2100  ev ) . specifically , the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath3-edge thresholds and @xmath4 emission from solid - density aluminum ( al ) plasma .",
    "they have been followed by another experiment at the high - power orion laser  @xcite .",
    "this experiment investigated @xmath3-shell emissions from hot dense al plasma .",
    "both experimental teams tried to describe their findings with the ek and sp models . in the first experiment a disagreement of the measured @xmath3-edges with the extensively used sp model was claimed .",
    "a modified ek model was proposed to fit the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "however , the data from the experiment on hot dense al plasma  @xcite could only be described with the sp model .",
    "the ek model was found to be in clear disagreement with these data .",
    "this controversy shows a strong need for a rigorous and consistent theoretical approach able to calculate the ipd effect for plasmas in different coupling regimes .",
    "here we propose such an approach : a two - step hartree - fock - slater ( hfs ) method .",
    "this model derives the electronic structure of an ion embedded in the electron plasma from the finite - temperature approach  @xcite , assuming thermalization of bound electrons within the free - electron plasma .",
    "it can also treat individual electronic configurations of plasma ions , which enables a description of discrete transitions . in this paper , we demonstrate that this model successfully describes laser - irradiated al solids under the conditions of the lcls  @xcite and orion laser  @xcite experiments .",
    "furthermore , we gain an improved understanding of the validity of the widely - used ek and sp models .",
    "in the first step , we apply the thermal hfs approach for a given finite temperature . here",
    "we assume that the electrons are fully thermalized .",
    "in general , xfel radiation induces non - equilibrium dynamics of electrons , for instance , in carbon - based materials exposed to hard x - rays  @xcite . for the solid - density al plasma studied in the recent experiment  @xcite ,",
    "the incident photon energy is near the ionization threshold , ejecting electrons with low kinetic energy . due to the high density and low kinetic energy , electron cross sections are large , so that electrons equilibrate rapidly within the ultrashort pulse duration .",
    "for example , in the al plasma considered here , the energy of a photoelectron is less than 270  ev and the highest energy of an auger electron is about 1.4  kev . with a kinetic energy in this regime ,",
    "the estimated time scale of electron thermalization is a few femtoseconds for diamond  @xcite and is expected to be shorter for solid al due to higher impact ionization cross sections .",
    "therefore , we assume that the electrons are thermalized within the pulse duration of tens of femtoseconds .",
    "the standard hartree - fock and hartree - fock - slater ( hfs ) approaches  @xcite treat electronic structure at zero temperature ( @xmath50  ev ) .",
    "they use the ritz variational principle for the ground - state energy .",
    "recently , thiele  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an extension of the standard hfs model , including plasma environment effects through the debye screening ( see also refs .",
    "however , this model is not applicable to plasmas with low temperature , where the debye screening approximation breaks down  @xcite .",
    "also , it is intrinsically inconsistent to combine the @xmath6  ev approach with debye screening for a plasma with a non - zero electron temperature . to overcome this inconsistency ,",
    "the electronic structure has to be derived from a finite - temperature approach .",
    "such a finite - temperature hartree - fock approach was proposed by @xcite .",
    "here we use the average - atom model  @xcite , which is a variant of the finite - temperature approach . basically , it predicts average orbital properties and occupation numbers at a given temperature .",
    "there have been various implementations of the average - atom approach .",
    "depending on their treatment of the electronic structure of atoms , they can be categorized as quantum mechanical approaches , such as the hartree - fock - slater ( hfs ) method or local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite , or semi - classical approaches , such as the thomas - fermi ( tf ) method  @xcite .",
    "there are also implementations with simplified super - configurations  @xcite and with the screened hydrogenic model  @xcite .",
    "the atomic potential within a plasma is usually based on the muffin - tin approximation  @xcite or an extended model including ion  ion correlation  @xcite .",
    "these average - atom models have been applied to calculate physical quantities within plasmas , such as lowering of the ionization energy  @xcite , photoabsorption processes  @xcite , and scattering processes  @xcite .",
    "our average - atom implementation presented here is based on the quantum mechanical approach with the muffin - tin approximation  @xcite , but it benefits from a numerical grid technique , which will be discussed in detail later .",
    "the major distinction of our proposed method from previous average - atom models is not only the different numerical method . in this paper",
    ", we will develop a simple model to retrieve more complete information from the average - atom approach .",
    "we propose a two - step model : an average - atom calculation as the first step and a fixed - configuration calculation as the second step . from the average - atom approach",
    ", we obtain a grand - canonical ensemble at a given temperature with a simple electronic mean field associated with all possible configurations . using this information",
    ", we then calculate improved mean fields for selected configurations of interest .",
