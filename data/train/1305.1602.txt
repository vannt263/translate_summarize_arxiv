    "gauge theories play an important role in many areas of physics . in particle physics , abelian and",
    "non - abelian gauge fields mediate the fundamental strong and electroweak forces between quarks , electrons , and neutrinos . in atomic and molecular physics ,",
    "electromagnetic abelian gauge fields are responsible for the coulomb forces that bind electrons to atomic nuclei . in condensed matter physics , besides the fundamental electromagnetic field , effective gauge fields may emerge dynamically at low energies @xcite .",
    "for example , in quantum hall systems , statistical gauge fields endow laughlin quasi - particles with anyon statistics",
    ". some quantum spin liquids @xcite , which may arise in geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets , can be described by quantum dimer models @xcite which are @xmath0 lattice gauge theories .",
    "other quantum spin liquids have abelian @xmath1 or non - abelian @xmath3 symmetry , and kitaev s toric code @xcite provides an example of a @xmath1 lattice gauge theory relevant in quantum information theory .",
    "furthermore , universal topological quantum computation is based on non - abelian chern - simons gauge theories @xcite .",
    "gauge theories reflect a redundancy in or description of nature .",
    "when we use vector potentials to talk about magnetic fields , we introduce unphysical degrees of freedom , which ultimately decouple thanks to a local gauge symmetry .",
    "similarly , when a condensed matter theorist factorizes an electron field into a charged spinless boson and a neutral fermion carrying the spin , a phase ambiguity arises that again manifests itself as a gauge symmetry .",
    "while one may speculate whether nature herself uses redundant variables at the ultimate cut - off scale , it is not surprising that gauge fields dominate the low - energy domain . in particular , abelian gauge fields can exist in a coulomb phase , which provides us with naturally massless photons that mediate the electromagnetic interaction between charges at arbitrarily large distances .",
    "non - abelian gauge theories @xcite , on the other hand , are confining and give rise to massive particles .",
    "for example , in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite with the non - abelian gauge group @xmath2 , massless gluons and almost massless quarks are turned into massive hadrons , including protons and neutrons .",
    "however , thanks to the property of asymptotic freedom , the hadron masses are exponentially small compared to the ultimate cut - off scale ( e.g.  the planck scale ) , and protons and neutrons hence also naturally participate in the low - energy physics .",
    "the robustness of gauge invariance at low energies , even if it is violated at the cut - off scale , has been recognized a long time ago @xcite .",
    "when gauge theories undergo the higgs mechanism , the gauge bosons pick up a mass at the scale of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "particle physicists are puzzled by the fact that the electroweak gauge bosons w and z as well as the higgs boson exist far below the planck scale , because the large mass hierarchy seems to require unnatural fine - tuning . in condensed matter",
    "physics , man - made fine - tuning happens on a daily basis .",
    "for example , by tuning a sophisticated material to a deconfined quantum critical point , one may hope to liberate an effective gauge boson that would otherwise remain confined and thus unobservable @xcite .",
    "the omnipresence of gauge fields confronts us with very rich low - energy dynamics that are often difficult to understand",
    ". in particular , in strongly coupled materials , such as frustrated quantum magnets , high - temperature superconductors , or dense nuclear matter , perturbative analytic methods fail , and one must resort to numerical calculations . despite tremendous successes of monte carlo simulations in condensed matter and particle physics , these problems remain largely intractable , due to very severe sign problems which prevent the importance sampling method underlying classical and quantum monte carlo .",
    "since the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the size of a quantum system , simulating it on a classical computer is in general very difficult . while some sign problems are np - complete @xcite , and thus believed to be practically unsolvable , the above mentioned sign problems arising in condensed matter and particle physics are probably not of this sort",
    "still , it may require more than a classical computer to deal with them .",
    "since the ground - breaking experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation @xcite , the field of atomic , molecular , and optical physics has undergone an impressive rapid development . in particular , the degree to which ultracold atomic systems can be engineered and controlled is truly remarkable .",
    "shor was first to show that , if it existed , a quantum computer would vastly outperform classical computers in the task of prime factorization @xcite .",
    "very early on , cirac and zoller realized theoretically that trapped ions could be used for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the prospect of perhaps being able to build a quantum computer spurred the development of algorithms for the envisioned machines .",
    "it was soon realized that cold atoms in optical lattices can also be used as quantum simulators . in this way , feynman s vision @xcite of simulating complicated physical systems by other well - controlled quantum systems is becoming a reality .",
    "quantum simulators @xcite are special purpose quantum computers which are used as digital @xcite or analog @xcite devices to simulate , for example , strongly coupled quantum systems relevant in condensed matter physics .",
    "quantum simulators have been constructed using ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , photons @xcite , or superconducting circuits on a chip @xcite .",
    "the d - wave one rainer chip is a @xmath4 aray of unit - cells each hosting 8 superconducting flux qubits with programmable couplings connecting numerous pairs of qubits .",
    "recently , a 108 qubit system has been used to run a finite - temperature variant of the quantum adiabatic algorithm @xcite on random instances of an ising spin glass hamiltonian @xcite . a comparison with a simulated classical and quantum annealer led the authors of this study to conclude that the d - wave device indeed performs quantum rather than classical annealing , however , as yet without achieving any speed - up compared to classical computation for the problem under consideration . since it utilizes the superposition of quantum phases in its hardware , a quantum simulator does not suffer from the notorious sign problem .",
    "from a condensed matter perspective , this is extremely interesting because highly non - trivial many - body systems , such as geometrically frustrated quantum antiferromagnets @xcite , various spin liquids , or high - temperature superconductors @xcite can perhaps be quantum simulated , despite the fact that the sign problem prevents numerical simulations on classical computers .",
    "it was a significant breakthrough , when a non - trivial quantum phase transition separating a mott insulator ( with localized particles ) from a superfluid , was first quantum simulated by implementing the bose - hubbard model with cold atoms in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the system are controlled by varying the depth of the optical potential generated by appropriately tuned laser beams . since",
    "the bose - hubbard model does not suffer from a sign problem , it can also be simulated on a classical computer . using quantum monte carlo , in this way",
    "the quantum simulator has been accurately validated in comparison to the cold atoms experiments @xcite .",
    "thus it has been demonstrated explicitly that accurate quantitative experimental control of the theoretical bose - hubbard model has indeed been achieved .",
    "it is natural to ask whether one can also quantum simulate relativistic field theories .",
    "a field theory quantum simulator should allow us to control a large number of strongly coupled field degrees of freedom , by engineering appropriate local hamiltonians .",
    "it should enable flexible initial state preparation and precise subsequent time - evolution , followed by final state detection .",
    "as usual for quantum systems , by repeating identically prepared experiments many times , one obtains physical results by averaging over them .",
    "quantum simulator constructions already exist for several bosonic @xcite and fermionic @xcite field theories .",
    "quantum simulators have also been constructed for quantum particles interacting with classical gauge fields .",
    "a most exciting development are synthetic background gauge fields , in order to access , for example , the fractional quantum hall effect or topological insulators with atoms .",
    "such synthetic gauge fields can mimic an external magnetic field @xcite .    in particle physics ,",
    "one is dealing , e.g. , with @xmath2 gluon gauge fields , which are not classical background fields but dynamical quantum fields .",
    "when coupled to quark fields , their non - perturbative quantum physics is very successfully described by wilson s lattice qcd @xcite . still , some problems remain intractable with this method , because again severe sign problems arise .",
    "for example , the hot quark - gluon plasma that is generated in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven or at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern undergoes an intriguing real - time evolution that is practically impossible to derive from qcd first principles . even staying within equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the critical endpoint of the chiral transition line in the qcd phase diagram , which will be investigated experimentally at the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi darmstadt , is difficult to determine accurately using lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "similarly , due to a severe sign problem , the deep interior of neutron stars , which may contain color superconducting quark matter @xcite can currently not be addressed non - perturbatively from qcd first principles either .",
    "while it is difficult to predict when full qcd quantum simulations with cold atoms might become experimentally feasible , it is timely to work towards this long - term goal @xcite .",
    "what are realistic short - term goals ?",
    "obviously , a quantum simulator should aim at those problems that are inaccessible to classical simulation methods ( but still verifiable for certain small - scale instances ) .",
    "this includes all problems involving real - time evolution or the physics at high baryon density .",
    "unlike classical computers , initially quantum simulators will not be precision instruments .",
    "in particular , they lack automatic error correction .",
    "one should hence concentrate on robust , fault - tolerant phenomena of a qualitative nature , such as the presence or absence of specific phases of strongly coupled high - density matter in abelian and non - abelian gauge theories , or specific events that may happen or not happen during real - time evolution .",
    "since one is interested in phenomena inaccessible to analytic perturbative calculations , one will deal with lattice gauge theories , for which continuous space is replaced by a discrete grid of lattice points .",
    "rather than aiming directly at the continuum limit of vanishing lattice spacing , it is more realistic and still extremely interesting to first address the strong coupling lattice dynamics .    in this review",
    ", we will approach gauge theories from a particle physics point of view , but we will also draw connections to condensed matter physics and quantum information theory . in section 2 ,",
    "we begin with the simpler case of abelian gauge theories . in order to address non - perturbative effects ,",
    "we regularize the theory on a lattice , first following the classical wilson formulation @xcite , and then extending the concept of lattice gauge theories to quantum link models @xcite .",
    "the resulting abelian gauge theories resemble models of condensed matter physics and quantum information theory . in section 3 ,",
    "we present various constructions of quantum simulators for abelian gauge theories , and discuss possible experimental realizations . in section 4",
    ", we then proceed to non - abelian gauge theories , first introducing them in the framework of wilson s lattice gauge theory , and again extending them to quantum link models .",
    "this gives rise to the alternative d - theory formulation of quantum field theory @xcite , which is well suited for quantum simulation with ultracold atoms . in section 5 ,",
    "we present several quantum simulator constructions of interesting non - abelian lattice gauge theories .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we summarize the current status of gauge theory quantum simulators , give an outlook on possible developments in the foreseeable future , and conclude by discussing what will need to be done to ultimately facilitate quantum simulations of qcd .",
    "in this section we consider abelian gauge theories , starting from classical electrodynamics , and then proceeding from the quantum mechanics of a single particle in a classical electromagnetic background field to the quantum field theory of dynamical abelian gauge fields .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is formulated non - perturbatively , first using wilson s lattice regularization .",
    "the concept of abelian lattice gauge fields is then extended to quantum link models , which are well - suited for quantum simulation using ultracold matter .",
    "both digital and analog quantum simulator constructions for @xmath1 and @xmath0 lattice gauge theories , with and without matter fields , are presented and related experiments are discussed .      the most familiar gauge theory is classical electrodynamics , the theory of electric and magnetic fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are functions of space and time that obey maxwell s equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electric charge and current densities . throughout this review ,",
    "we are using natural units in which @xmath10 . in order to ensure the absence of magnetic monopoles , i.e.   @xmath11 , it is convenient to introduce a vector potential @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , in order to guarantee that the other homogeneous maxwell equation is automatically satisfied as well , one also introduces a scalar potential @xmath13 and one writes @xmath14 the representation of electromagnetic fields in terms of scalar and vector potentials has a high degree of redundancy .",
    "in particular , the physical fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 remain invariant under arbitrary gauge transformations @xmath15 , @xmath16      while in classical physics the introduction of scalar and vector potentials is mostly a mathematical convenience , it becomes unavoidable when we want to write down the schrdinger equation , @xmath17 for a quantum mechanical point particle of mass @xmath18 and charge @xmath19 , propagating in a classical electromagnetic background field . here @xmath20 are covariant derivatives . when the particle s wave function is gauge transformed to @xmath21 \\psi(\\vec x , t),\\ ] ] the covariant derivatives transform as @xmath22 d_t \\psi(\\vec x , t ) , \\quad \\vec d \\psi(\\vec x , t ) ' =   \\exp\\left[i e \\alpha(\\vec x , t)\\right ] \\vec d \\psi(\\vec x , t),\\ ] ] such that the schrdinger equation transforms gauge covariantly .      in relativistic particle physics , not only the electromagnetic field but also charged matter , for example , electrons and positrons are described by a field .",
    "this is in contrast to a single non - relativistic particle , which is just described by its quantum mechanical wave function .",
    "relativistic electrons and positrons indeed are not point `` particles '' , but arise as quantized excitations ( sometimes called `` wavicles '' ) of the relativistic dirac field , which is coupled to the electromagnetic photon field . like other interacting field theories , quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    " the field theory of electrons , positrons , and photons  suffers from ultraviolet divergences , which are removed in the process of regularization and subsequent renormalization . in perturbation theory , one regularizes individual feynman diagrams . in order to define gauge theories beyond perturbation theory , wilson has regularized them on a lattice that replaces continuous space ( and usually even space - time ) by a regular cubic grid .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath23 serves as an ultraviolet momentum cut - off @xmath24 . in the process of renormalization ,",
    "the coupling constants become functions of @xmath23 and are properly tuned to reach the continuum limit @xmath25 . in order to familiarize ourselves with the lattice regularization in a simple setting , we first consider staggered lattice fermions hopping in a classical electromagnetic background field .    unlike in typical lattice calculations , where one works with a path integral formulation on a @xmath26-dimensional euclidean space - time lattice , here we work in a hamiltonian formulation in which time remains real and continuous ,",
    "while the @xmath27-dimensional space @xmath28 is replaced by a cubic lattice that consists of points @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31",
    ". putting relativistic fermions on a lattice is a subtle issue . in particular ,",
    "when the dirac equation is naively discretized , one faces the fermion doubling problem .",
    "instead of one physical fermion , one encounters additional @xmath32 species @xcite . in his original formulation of lattice qcd ,",
    "wilson has explicitly removed the unwanted doubler fermions by giving them a large mass at the order of the cut - off @xmath24 . through renormalization",
    "the physical fermion then also receives a large mass , which must be fine - tuned unnaturally , in order to obtain a light physical dirac fermion with a mass far below the lattice cut - off . in the mean time , the fermion doubling problem has been solved elegantly by kaplan s domain wall fermions @xcite , which reside in an additional spatial dimension . here",
    "we will use a simple way of bypassing the fermion doubling problem , first suggested by susskind @xcite . via a process known as spin diagonalization , the additional fermionic degrees of freedom",
    "are then reduced and partly reinterpreted as fermion `` flavors '' . here",
    "we choose staggered fermions because they provide the simplest realization of relativistic massless lattice fermions .",
    "staggered fermions are described by anti - commuting creation and annihilation operators , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , associated with the lattice sites @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . unlike standard dirac fermions , staggered fermions have no additional degrees of freedom . in particular ,",
    "the spin is encoded in the spatial position @xmath35 . from a condensed matter physics perspective , staggered fermions thus look like spinless fermions .",
    "free staggered fermions of mass @xmath18 , hopping between neighboring lattice sites @xmath35 and @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is a vector of length @xmath23 in the spatial @xmath40-direction ) are described by the hamiltonian @xmath41 here @xmath42 is a hopping parameter , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 are sign - factors associated with the points @xmath35 and with the links connecting neighboring lattice points @xmath35 and @xmath45 , respectively . the site factor is given by @xmath46 .",
    "for the links in the 1-direction @xmath47 , for those in the 2-direction @xmath48 , and for the links in the @xmath40-direction @xmath49 .",
    "the sign - factors associated with the links represent a fixed @xmath1 background `` gauge '' field , with a @xmath50-flux on each plaquette , which replaces the @xmath51-matrices of standard dirac fermions .",
    "the free staggered fermion hamiltonian of eq.([hfree ] ) is even simpler than the one of the hubbard model , which also incorporates spin as well as an on - site fermion repulsion .",
    "since there are implementations of quantum simulators for the hubbard model using ultracold matter in optical lattices , it is straightforward to construct quantum simulators for staggered fermions as well .",
    "however , it is more non - trivial to quantum simulate dynamical gauge fields .",
    "before we approach this problem , let us first ask how staggered lattice fermions propagate in a classical electromagnetic background field . in order to address this question , we must first translate the continuum gauge field @xmath52 to a lattice gauge field . since @xmath52 is a vector ,",
    "its lattice variant is naturally associated not with a single lattice site @xmath35 , but with the directed link connecting neighboring sites @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "when a gauge theory is regularized on the lattice , it is vital to maintain its invariance under gauge transformations .",
    "since a continuum gauge transformation @xmath53 involves a derivative , and thus the infinitesimal neighborhood of a point @xmath35 , it is natural to integrate the continuum gauge field over the link connecting @xmath35 and @xmath45 .",

    "now we want to treat the field itself as a quantum object .",

    "the hilbert space of wilson s lattice gauge theory is infinite - dimensional , even for a single link .",
