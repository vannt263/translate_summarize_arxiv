    "this implies that the framing of the surgery , given by  @xmath155 , makes one negative twist in the @xmath156plane relative to the contact framing as we go once around @xmath151 in @xmath108direction ( this sign is independent of the choice of orientation for  @xmath151 ) .",

    "* lemma  2.2 ) ) that the local diffeomorphism between the two hypersurfaces defined by following the integral curves of @xmath144 is a contactomorphism .",

    "* for the trivial knot  @xmath18 , these invariants satisfy the thurston - bennequin inequality @xmath195    the consequences of these properties that we shall use in the next section are the following :    * the legendrian knot @xmath196 in @xmath176 whose front projection is a simple closed curve with two cusps has the invariants @xmath197 and  @xmath198 .",
    "* by approximating the front projection of @xmath196 by a front with an additional zigzag ( a left and a right cusp , oriented up or down ) and no self - crossings , we can decrease the thurston - bennequin invariant by  @xmath6 ( i.e.  add a negative twist to the contact framing ) and decrease or increase the rotation number by  @xmath6 . hence , by adding @xmath199 zigzags we can realise @xmath200 and any of the @xmath201 different rotation numbers @xmath202 i.e.  all values in steps by  @xmath5 in the range allowed by the thurston - bennequin inequality .",
    "another useful fact that can easily be proved using the concept of front projections is that any knot @xmath179 in @xmath176 can be @xmath203approximated by a legendrian knot : simply approximate the plane curve @xmath204 by a front ( with many zigzags ) whose slope approximates  @xmath183 .",

    "one now argues as in the proof of  ( * ? ? ?",

    "this means that @xmath277 is glued to the dividing curve  @xmath48 .",
    "so the possible contact @xmath21surgeries are determined by the tight contact structures on @xmath214 with convex boundary satisfying @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",

    "we see that @xmath286 is glued to  @xmath112 , so again the possible contact surgeries are the ones corresponding to tight contact structures on the solid torus with boundary slope @xmath287 .",

    "the only case left open is that of a contact @xmath78surgery .",
    "we claim that the result of any contact @xmath78surgery is the same as that of a suitable contact @xmath33surgery .",
    "we defer the proof of this fact to the next section , because it can best be dealt with in the context of lutz twists . taking this statement about @xmath78surgery for granted",

    ", @xmath314 is unique ; in the case of a full lutz twist there are two choices .",
    "homotopy classes of ( cooriented ) @xmath5plane fields on @xmath1 are classified by the homotopy group @xmath315 . as shown by lutz  @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite ( again , the full details are folklore ) , each of these homotopy classes contains a contact structure , obtained by suitable lutz twists from @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , eliashberg  @xcite has given a complete classification ( up to isotopy ) of contact structures on  @xmath1 : each homotopy class contains exactly one overtwisted contact structure , and the only tight contact structure is the standard one  @xmath11 . the overtwisted contact structure that is homotopic to @xmath11 as a @xmath5plane field can be obtained from @xmath11 by a full lutz twist . in conclusion , every contact structure on @xmath1 can be obtained from @xmath11 by lutz twists .",
    "let @xmath319 be the unique radius for which @xmath320 .",
    "then along the @xmath5torus @xmath321 the contact structure @xmath114 is given by @xmath322 , so the characteristic foliation on @xmath323 is linear of slope @xmath324 .",

    "this shows that the restriction of @xmath114 to @xmath327 is tight , for by dehn twists along the meridian and rescaling the @xmath21coordinate we can embed this into the solid torus with its standard tight contact structure @xmath328 .",
    "now perturb @xmath323 into a convex torus of slope  @xmath6 as described at the end of section  [ section : surgery ] .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath114 to the perturbed @xmath230 is the tight contact structure uniquely determined by this convex boundary and may be thought of as a standard neighbourhood of its legendrian spine  @xmath174 .",

    "the restriction of @xmath114 to this thickened torus is tight ( after a diffeomorphism of the thickened torus it is seen to embed into the standard tight structure on @xmath106 ) , the boundaries are convex , and @xmath114 is _ minimally twisting _ in the sense of  ( * ? ? ? * section  2.2.1 ) , that is , the contact structure twists minimally in radial direction to satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "notice that with respect to @xmath236 the slope of @xmath333 is  @xmath334 , since @xmath335 is glued to @xmath336 .",
