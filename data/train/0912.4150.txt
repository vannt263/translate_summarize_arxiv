    "the higgs mechanism gives rise to clear and detectable signatures that can be probed at hadron colliders .",
    "the tevatron is now leading a race  @xcite , that the lhc will soon join , to find this spinless particle .",
    "the most relevant searches for a sm higgs boson by the lep experiments  @xcite were based on the associated production mechanism , via @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a limit of @xmath6 @xmath0 was obtained combining all lep analyses based on such searches . as the coupling of a higgs boson to gauge bosons",
    "is fixed in the sm , it is clear that a lighter higgs can only exist in a model where its couplings to gauge bosons ( and possibly those to fermions ) are reduced relative to the sm .",
    "moreover , any complementary process , such as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a pseudo - scalar higgs boson and @xmath9 is the lightest higgs scalar boson ( i.e. , with the same quantum number as the sm state ) in the model , which appears , e.g. , in a pure 2-higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) or in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , has to be kinematically forbidden .",
    "this is a consequence of the obvious sum rule @xmath10 valid in a pure 2hdm and in the mssm .",
    "there were also searches at lep based on the yukawa processes @xmath11 in the higgs mass range @xmath12 gev in  @xcite and in the channels @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for higgs masses up to 50 gev in  @xcite .",
    "these studies are only relevant for large values of the yukawa coupling constants and will be discussed in section  [ sec : bounds ] .",
    "such a scenario , with a very light higgs , can easily arise by adding higgs scalar singlets and/or doublets to the higgs sector of the sm .",
    "starting from the first simple extension that allows for a lighter higgs state - i.e. , adding a neutral singlet - we will explore all possible scenarios to a maximum of a democratic 3-higgs doublet model ( 3hdm ( d ) )  @xcite plus one neutral scalar singlet .",
    "we will see that from the very simplest extension to all models built thereafter , a very light higgs state is allowed via a reduction of the couplings to gauge bosons .",
    "as expected , the more freedom is added by the new fields the more parameter space is available to accommodate a light higgs boson .",
    "the possibility of the existence of a very light higgs boson , with a mass below 80 gev , in the context of models with two higgs doublets , was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a very light higgs boson in the context of the mssm , with a mass as low as about 60 gev , was discussed in  @xcite .    assuming this light object would have eluded all lep searches due to a small enough @xmath16 coupling ( where @xmath17 ) , the production mechanisms that involve such @xmath16 couplings , like vector boson fusion or higgs - strahlung , have consequently negligible cross sections .",
    "therefore , we have to rely on the production modes where higgs couplings to fermions are present . under these conditions ,",
    "the process with the largest cross section is gluon fusion .",
    "hence , we have performed a detailed parton level study on the feasibility of the detection of a very light higgs state ( below @xmath18 ) at the lhc in the production process @xmath2",
    "@xcite , where @xmath3 represents a resolved jet ( that indeed proceeds mainly via gluon fusion ) .",
    "we have recently presented a similar study for the sm higgs boson  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the lhc and a study for the tevatron was performed in  @xcite .",
    "the reason to choose such a final state , involving @xmath19 s , amongst those accessible at hadron colliders , is clear .",
    "had we chosen @xmath20 instead , we would have been overwhelmed by qcd background while the final state with @xmath21 was not considered because when we vary the higgs boson mass from 120 @xmath0 ( where the branching ratio ( br ) roughly peaks for a sm - like higgs ) down to 20 @xmath0 , the corresponding br drops by a factor of @xmath22 10 . therefore , unless one is exploring a model where the higgs decay to photons is enhanced , the @xmath23 mode is the most appropriate channel for light higgs states .",
    "other production channels , like @xmath24 , will be explored in the future  @xcite .",
    "we will show that such a very light higgs could be detected with this process in several extended models and that for particular scenarios an early detection is also possible . at the very least",
    ", an effort should be made to definitely exclude such a light particle and the lhc definitely has the means to do so .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to describe the signal and background processes in the sm while the following one extrapolates our findings to a variety of beyond the sm scenarios with an enlarged higgs sector .",
    "iv introduces the experimental and theoretical bounds enforced in our analysis .",
    "final results are presented in sect .",
    "v ( for various scenarios separately ) while sect .",
    "vi draws our conclusions .",
    "finally , one appendix will help us in classifying four types of 2hdm .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite we have performed a detailed parton level study on the feasibility of the detection of a higgs boson in the gluon fusion process @xmath25 at the lhc . in this section",
    "we will extend the study for higgs masses below 100 @xmath0 to probe extensions of the sm where a very light higgs is still allowed .",
    "the results will be presented considering the case where all higgs couplings to fermions are the sm ones so that they can be used in extensions of the sm with the same final state . as a detailed discussion of the parton level analysis",
    "was already presented in  @xcite , here we will just highlight the main points and refer the reader to reference  @xcite for details .",
    "the signal , @xmath26 , is a one loop process with partonic contributions from @xmath27 , @xmath28 , which is approximately 20 % of the total cross section , and @xmath29 , which was shown to be negligible  @xcite and was not taken into account in our study .",
    "we note that this is a parton level study : effects of initial and final state radiation as well as hadronisation were not taken into account .",
    "the sm signal and all background processes were generated with calchep  @xcite and cross checked with madgraph / madevent  @xcite .",
    "the higgs brs to @xmath30 were evaluated with the hdecay  @xcite package ( and modifications thereof ) . in the models with an extended scalar sector ,",
    "the one loop amplitudes for the signal @xmath26 were generated and calculated with the packages feynarts  @xcite and formcalc  @xcite .",
    "the scalar integrals were evaluated with looptools  @xcite and the cteq6l parton distribution functions  @xcite were used .",
    "the jet ( leptons ) energies were smeared according to the following gaussian distribution @xmath31 to take into account the respective detector energy resolution effects , where @xmath32 is the factor for jets while @xmath33 is the corresponding factor for leptons .",
    "each @xmath19 can either decay leptonically or hadronically . as a three jet final state is very hard to identify at a hadron collider , we will concentrate on the other two possibilities - two taus decaying leptonically ( @xmath34 ) or one tau decaying leptonically and the other hadronically ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "these are also the final states with robust trigger signatures - the events are selected by an isolated electron with @xmath36 or an isolated muon with @xmath37 . in both analyses",
    "we have considered the main source of irreducible background : @xmath38 for @xmath34 and @xmath39 , where one jet originates from a tau , for the @xmath40 case . in @xmath38",
    "we include all possible combinations of @xmath41 and in @xmath39 only the intermediate state @xmath42 is included - the @xmath43 signature , where a jet would fake a lepton with a given probability , is taken into account in the @xmath43 background .",
    "the main source of reducible background for the @xmath34 analysis comes from @xmath44 while for the @xmath35 case it is the process @xmath45 that dominates  @xcite .",
    "the tau reconstruction efficiency was taken to be 0.3 and accordingly we have used a tau rejection factor against jets as a function of the jet @xmath46 using the values presented in the atlas study in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have included the @xmath47 background taken at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) . by vetoing the events",
    "if the tagging jet is consistent with a @xmath48-jet hypothesis for @xmath49 we were able to discard most of the @xmath50 background .",
    "the @xmath50 background is larger for @xmath34 as there are more possible combinations when the @xmath51 bosons decay leptonically .    .",
    "on the left for the @xmath34 analysis and on the right for the @xmath35 case . in this figure all cuts described in the text were applied except for the missing energy cut.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] . on the left for the @xmath34 analysis and on the right for the @xmath35 case . in this figure",
    "all cuts described in the text were applied except for the missing energy cut.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    the two other a priori very important sources of reducible background can be brought to a manageable level through a judicial cut in the transverse missing energy .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : missing ] where the transverse missing energy ( imbalance of all observed momenta ) distribution for a higgs mass of 60 @xmath0 is shown .",
    "the huge qcd @xmath52 background drops five orders of magnitude as soon as we cross the 25 @xmath0 threshold for the missing energy .",
    "there is still a tail due to the leptonic decays of @xmath53 and @xmath48-quarks which involve a considerable amount of missing energy as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : missing ] . in accordance with cms  @xcite and atlas studies  @xcite",
    "we have used 0.001 as the probability of a jet faking one electron and , as explained earlier , we have taken the tau reconstruction efficiency to be 0.3 and accordingly we have used a tau rejection factor against jets as a function of the jet @xmath46  @xcite that range from 0.01 to 0.001 .",
    "the identification of the higgs boson signal can only be accomplished by an effective reduction of the dominating irreducible @xmath54 background .",
    "therefore , the reconstruction of the mass peak @xmath55 at @xmath56 is essential . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see  @xcite . the reconstructed mass distribution is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : window ] for a higgs mass of 60 @xmath0 after all cuts for @xmath34 on the left panel and for @xmath35 on the right one . in both analyses we have sharp mass peaks for the signal and",
    "also clear peaks at @xmath57 for the @xmath54 background .",
    "* we require one electron with @xmath36 or one muon with @xmath37 for triggering purposes .",
    "an additional lepton in the event has @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "a 90 % efficiency is assumed for the reconstruction of the electron and muon and the separation between leptons and/or jets was chosen as @xmath60 and @xmath61 for all leptons .",
    "* we require that at least one jet has @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "* we require that the hadronic tau has @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "* we veto the event if there is an additional jet with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . *",
    "we apply a mass window @xmath66 . *",
    "events are vetoed if the tagging jet consistent with a @xmath48-jet hypothesis is found with @xmath49 ( we assume a @xmath48-jet tagging efficiency of 60 % ) . *",
    "finally , we require the transverse missing energy to be @xmath67 .    in tab .",
    "i we present the sm signal and sum of all background cross sections , signal - to - background ( @xmath68 ) ratios and the significance ( @xmath69 ) as a function of the higgs mass . in the first and second columns we show the results for the @xmath34 analysis while columns three and four are for the @xmath35 case . in the last two columns we present the combined values for the signal - to - background @xmath68 ratio and the significance @xmath69 .",
    "this study could still be extended to values below 20 gev , as an experimental analysis could well be carried out for such very small values of the higgs mass .",
    "however , the computational tools we are using here are not reliable in this higgs mass regime , so we refrain from investigating this phenomenological possibility now .",
    "it is clear that the signal observation can be systematically challenging for the larger higgs masses , but the values of the @xmath68 ratio can be improved at the expense of the significance by shrinking the higgs mass window especially when its mass is close to the mass of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "the highest significance and the highest @xmath68 ratio takes place for @xmath70 @xmath0 because it is the value farthest away from the irreducible @xmath71 background .    in tab .",
