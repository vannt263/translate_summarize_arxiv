    "it has been realized that quantum entanglement is a key ingredient in quantum computation , quantum communication , and quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "many two - level quantum systems , or qubits , have been widely used in quantum information@xcite .",
    "recently , the bipartite qutrit systems have drawn people s attention and exhibited varieties of advantages .",
    "it enables powerful computation@xcite , establishes secure communication@xcite and cryptography@xcite , and reduces the communication complexity@xcite .",
    "additionally , the high energy quantum teleportation using neutral kaons has been investigated@xcite .",
    "these hint the possibility of connecting quantum information and particle physics , this connection may reveal novel and interesting feature .",
    "considering these two aspects , we take the mixed light pseudoscalar meson states , a type of bipartite qutrit system , into account .    in particle physics ,",
    "the study on mixed meson states@xcite plays an important role and many works are devoted to this field@xcite , especially the study on @xmath5 mixed state , since it provides a unique opportunity for testing qcd @xcite which is widely used in describing strong interaction . in the last decades , people have studied the mixing angle@xcite , the hadronic @xmath2-@xmath4 decay@xcite , @xmath2-@xmath4 mixing in radiative @xmath6-meson decay@xcite , and so on .",
    "however , much work of particle physics has been done for testing the theory and experiment while hardly concerned with quantum information and the related algebra configuration , such as yangians . as is known ,",
    "the light pseudoscalar meson states in quark - flavor basis have @xmath7 symmetry@xcite .",
    "it is important to expand the research on the symmetry of pseudoscalar meson states to yangian @xmath0 .",
    "yangian , as an algebra beyond the lie algebra , is a powerful mathematical method for investigating the new symmetry of quantum systems which are nonlinear and integrable . demonstrating and investigating whether simple physical systems possess yangian is important and helpful for exploring physical systems via quantum algebra .",
    "people have found the yangian symmetry in many physical models , such as calogero - sutherland model@xcite , the hubbard model@xcite and the heisenberg model@xcite , etc .",
    "the realizations of @xmath8@xcite as the simplest one in yangian algebra have been gained much attention .",
    "however , the yangian related to the lie algebra @xmath7 , @xmath0 , which is closed to the light pseudoscalar meson states in particle physics , need to be investigated in more detail .",
    "thus , much attention is going to be payed in this paper to the application of @xmath0 algebra in the meson systems here .",
    "in the low mass hadron region , the violations of isospin symmetry for pseudoscalar meson states within qcd are generated by the admixtures of @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 . @xmath2 and @xmath4 are linear combination of @xmath7 singlet @xmath9 and octet @xmath10 , @xmath3 is another @xmath7 octet . because of the important application and significance of @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 mixing , we choose their superposition states as the initial state @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the normalized real amplitudes and they satisfy @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the entanglement degree of the genuine n - particle qutrit pure state@xcite is measured by its mean entropy @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the reduced partial von neumann entropy for the @xmath21th particle only , with the other @xmath22 particles traced out , and @xmath23 is the corresponding reduced density matrix . since the system in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is bipartite qutrit , i.e. @xmath24 , the corresponding entanglement degree of this initial state can be calculated via eq.([2 ] ) , thus we have @xmath25 the behavior of @xmath26 depending on @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( due to the normalization condition , @xmath14 is not an independent parameter . )",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     for different @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "]    before constructing transition operators , let us first give a brief introduction of yangian @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 algebra@xcite is generated by the generators @xmath27 which are usually defined as follows @xmath28 here @xmath29 form a @xmath7 algebra characterized by @xmath30 , @xmath31 form a local @xmath7 on the @xmath21 site , and are equal to half of the corresponding gell - mann matrices , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 are parameters or casimir operators and @xmath35 which satisfies @xmath36    a more practical expression is expressed as @xmath37 here @xmath38 are the generators of @xmath0 .",
    "due to the transition effect of yangian generators , transition operators @xmath39 can be constructed as compositions of the generators in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) .",
    "@xmath39 can be looked upon as a function of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , namely , @xmath42 $ ] . when acting the transition operator on @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , a final state @xmath44 can be gotten and its entanglement degree @xmath45 can also be calculated out via eq.([2 ] ) . different final states with desired entanglement degrees thus can be gotten by acting corresponding transition operators on initial states .    in order to illustrate this issue clearly , several simple examples are going to be discussed in more detail .",
    "as we discussed before , the entanglement degree of final state can be tuned by changing the parameters of the transition operator . as an example , let us act the transition operator of @xmath46 on the initial state in eq.([eq1 ] ) , the corresponding final state is @xmath47.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the normalizing condition leads to @xmath48 and @xmath49=1 $ ] . as discussed in the preceding section , the entanglement degree of the final state @xmath50 can be calculated by the use of eq.([2 ] ) as @xmath51 as we can see , by changing the value of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the entanglement degree @xmath52 can be tuned .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the case of @xmath53",
    ".     varies with @xmath33 and @xmath34 when @xmath53 . ]",
    "another more simpler case is @xmath54 for which the final state reads latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    with normalization condition @xmath48 and @xmath56=3 $ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 which also depends on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as shown in fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    ".     varies with @xmath33 and @xmath34 when @xmath53 . ]",
    "these two examples clearly shows that by tuning the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 of transition operators , the entanglement degree of final state varies between 0 and 1",
    ".    however , there are exceptional cases in which the entanglement degree of final state is found to be the same as the initial state or be zero , independent with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as is shown in the next section .",
    "although generally , transition operators with different @xmath33 and @xmath34 provide final states with different entanglement degrees , there do exist special cases in which the final state possesses the same entanglement degree with the initial state or the final state are totally disentangled .",
    "both cases are very important in quantum information and quantum computation .    for the transition operator @xmath58 , the final state is @xmath59 with normalizing condition @xmath60 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is very easy to verify that the entanglement degree of the final state @xmath50 is equal to the one of the initial state , namely , @xmath61 .",
    "same thing happens on transition operator @xmath62 , corresponding to whom the final state reads @xmath63 with normalizing condition being @xmath60 and @xmath48 .",
    "again , calculation shows that @xmath61 .    without any difficulty",
    ", it can be verified that transition operators @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 lead to total disentangled final states , independent of the choice of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the initial state .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the entanglement degrees of pseudoscalar meson states via quantum algebra @xmath0 . by making use of transition effect of generators @xmath1 of @xmath0",
    ", we have constructed various transition operators in terms of @xmath1 , and have acted them on @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath4 mixing meson state .",
    "the entanglement degrees of both the initial state and final state have been calculated with the help of entropy theory .",
    "our result shows that a state with desired entanglement degree can be achieved by acting proper chosen transition operator on an initial state .",
    "this is very helpful to control the degree of entanglement in quantum communication .",
    "entanglement has been considered as an essential resource in most applications of quantum information@xcite . although the quantum channels used in quantum teleportation are usually represented by a maximally entangled pair@xcite",
    ", partially entangled quantum channel becomes a hot topic@xcite nowadays due to the noise factors in the realistic world .",
    "moreover , in quantum computing , a new important development is the probabilistic implementation of a nonlocal gate by using a single non - maximally entangled state@xcite .",
    "the success fidelity maintains a high level though the state shared is partially entangled .",
