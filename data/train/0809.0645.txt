    "this is the classical artin presentation of @xmath5 ( see e.g. chapter 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "the group @xmath14 is closely related to the modular group @xmath15 .",
    "the above presentation shows that the braid @xmath16 is central in @xmath14 and that @xmath17 is generated by the class @xmath18 of @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "thus @xmath23 .",
    "in fact the group @xmath14 admits a proper isometric action with compact quotient on a metric product @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a trivalent tree , which is the bass - serre tree of @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested here in the 4-string braid groups @xmath0 .",
    "it was proved by brady in @xcite that @xmath0 admits a free isometric action with compact quotient on a cat(0 ) simplicial complex @xmath26 of dimension 3 .",
    "the 3-dimensional cells of @xmath26 are euclidean tetrahedra whose faces are right - angle triangles and the quotient space @xmath27 contains 16 tetrahedra , identified together along a single vertex .",
    "it is still true that @xmath26 splits as a product @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is now of dimension 2 .",
    "the complex @xmath29 can be obtained from a non positively curved complex of groups whose fundamental group is the quotient of @xmath0 by its center ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a cat(0 ) structure on @xmath5 is an open problem for @xmath30 .",
    "recall that on @xmath0 , the 3-dimensional cat(0 ) structure which are minimal ( e.g. , those whose links are isomorphic to that of @xmath26 ) can be classified , by geometric rigidity results due to crisp and paoluzzi @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "charney @xcite proved that the deligne complex @xcite of @xmath0 is also a cat(0 ) space of dimension 3 , with respect to the moussong metric ( we remind that the deligne action of @xmath0 on this complex is not proper ) .",
    "let now @xmath31 be an arbitrary countable group .",
    "a length on @xmath31 is a map @xmath32 such that @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 the identity element .",
    "we recall that @xmath31 is said to have _ property rd _ ( @xcite ) with respect to a length @xmath38 if there is a polynomial @xmath39 such that for any @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 one has @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ball of radius @xmath45 in @xmath31 , @xmath46 is the set of @xmath47 with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the complex group algebra of @xmath31 .",
    "for an introduction to property rd we refer to chapter 8 in @xcite .",
    "the above convolution inequality , usually referred to as the haagerup inequality ( after haagerup @xcite ) , allows to control the operator norm of @xmath50 acting by convolution on @xmath51 in terms of its @xmath52 norm .",
    "hence , some important consequences of property rd are of a spectral nature .",
    "when @xmath31 is finitely generated we have the word length @xmath53 associated to any finite generating set @xmath54 .",
    "then property rd with respect to @xmath55 is independent of @xmath54 so we simply speak of property rd for @xmath31 is that case .",
    "our first main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ th1 ] the braid group @xmath0 on 4 strings , as well as its central quotient @xmath1 , have property rd .",
    "this gives a partial answer to a question in @xcite , section 8 .",
    "the fact that @xmath14 has property rd was shown very early on by jolissaint in @xcite , and the other cases remained open since then ; in @xcite , the question of property rd is raised more generally for all braid groups @xmath5 .    _",
    "the problem of showing property rd for @xmath5 has been solved recently by behrstock and minsky ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , they established property rd for all mapping class groups ( recall that the braid group @xmath5 can be identified to the mapping class group of the @xmath6-punctured disk . )    the proof of theorem [ th1 ] is divided into two steps .",
    "the first step relies on our previous results from @xcite :    [ th3 ] let @xmath31 be a group acting properly on a cat(0 ) simplicial complex @xmath56 of dimension 2 without boundary and whose faces are equilateral triangles of the euclidean plane .",
    "then @xmath31 has property rd with respect to the length induced from the 1-skeleton of @xmath56 .",
    "we apply theorem [ th3 ] to the quotient @xmath1 . by results of @xcite ,",
    "this group acts on a simplicial complex @xmath29 with the required properties .",
    "the second step uses automaticity of @xmath0 , and more precisely , the thurston normal forms for braids in @xmath0 , which allows to go back to @xmath0 from its central quotient .    details of the proof are in section [ s2 ] , after a brief survey on property rd in section [ s1 ]",
    ". it would be interesting to implement the above approach of solving first the case of central quotients for higher braid groups .    as a corollary of theorem [ th1 ]",
    ", we obtain the following result ( compare @xcite , section 8 , where the question of property rd is raised in general for all @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) :    [ c3 ] the automorphism group @xmath2 of the free group on 2 generators has property rd .    indeed , @xmath2 is isomorphic to @xmath59 , itself containing @xmath60 as a subgroup of index 2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus property rd for @xmath2 follows from the corresponding result for @xmath60 , which is isomorphic to the central quotient of @xmath0 .",
    "note that in @xcite , a faithful action of @xmath61 on the complex @xmath29 is constructed .",
    "groups and simplicial complexes appearing in theorem [ th3 ] provide us with a large pool of objects satisfying _ intermediate rank _",
    "see @xcite for definitions and concrete examples .",
    "we discuss here the intermediate rank properties of @xmath0 and its central quotient ( denoted @xmath31 below ) .",
    "we introduced in @xcite a notion of _ mesoscopic rank _ for a cat(0 ) space @xmath29 , which reflects the presence in @xmath29 of maximal flats portions ( where maximal refers to the dimension , hence the rank terminology ) which are ( much ) larger than  germs of flats \" in @xmath29 ( say , flats of tangent cones ) but _ are not actually contained in genuine flats of @xmath29 _ ( i.e. copies of the euclidean space @xmath62 inside @xmath29 ) .",
    "we recall the precise definitions of mesoscopic rank and exponential mesoscopic rank in section [ s3 ] .",
    "following @xcite we say that a group @xmath31 is of ( exponential ) mesoscopic rank when there is a proper action of @xmath31 with compact quotient on some cat(0 ) space which is of ( exponential ) mesoscopic rank at some point .",
    "our second main result is as follows .",
    "[ meso ] the braid group @xmath0 on 4 strings is of exponential mesoscopic rank .    for the proof",
    ", we first establish that the quotient @xmath31 of @xmath0 by its center is of exponential mesoscopic rank , and then extend the result to @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath14 is an example of a group acting freely and cocompactly on a simplicial complex as in theorem [ th3 ] ( see @xcite ) but it is not of mesoscopic rank , and more precisely for any action with compact quotient on a 2-dimensional cat(0 ) space @xmath29 , the space @xmath29 can not be of mesoscopic rank .",
    "in course of proving theorem [ meso ] we will see that the central quotient @xmath31 of @xmath0 is , at the local level , closely related to affine bruhat - tits buildings of type @xmath63 ( what actually creates some complications in the proof of theorem [ meso ] , since the latter are not of mesoscopic rank by @xcite ) .",
    "we will prove however that these connections can not be extended beyond the local level ( and specifically beyond the sphere of radius 1 , see the last section of the paper ) .",
    "related to this , we also show that being of exponential mesoscopic rank can not serve as an obstruction to being embeddable in an affine building , and in particular , in spaces which are not of mesoscopic rank .",
    "_ acknowledgments .",
    "_ we thank jason behrstock for communicating us his recent preprint @xcite with yair minsky , as well as for the reference @xcite .",
    "the second author thanks jsps for support .",
    "in @xcite haagerup proved that , for any finitely supported functions @xmath64 defined on the free group @xmath65 on @xmath6 generators , the convolution product satisfies the inequality @xmath66 where @xmath45 is the radius of the support of @xmath50 , with respect to the usual word - length metric of @xmath65 . in other words @xmath50 , viewed as a convolution operator from @xmath67 to itself , is bounded with operator norm at most @xmath68 .",
    "groups satisfying the above inequality with some polynomial @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 are said to have property rd ( the precise definition of which we recalled in the introduction ) , see @xcite , where jolissaint showed that ( with respect to the word length ) :    * a finitely generated amenable group has property rd if and only if it is of polynomial growth ; * uniform lattices in a rank 1 lie group have property rd .",
    "the latter has been extended to all hyperbolic groups in the sense of gromov by de la harpe @xcite , and subsequently to groups which are hyperbolic relatively to polynomial growth subgroups by chatterji and ruane @xcite , thereby establishing property rd for all lattices ( uniform or not ) in rank 1 lie groups .",
    "the situation is different for groups of rank @xmath71 .",
    "non uniform lattices in a higher rank lie group , typically @xmath72 , are prominent examples of groups without property rd ( cf .",
    "valette conjectured that all uniform lattices in higher rank lie groups have property rd .",
    "this is known to hold for uniform lattices in @xmath73 ( and other groups acting on triangle buildings ) , by a well - known theorem of ramagge  robertson ",
    "steger @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which was the first occurrence of property rd in higher rank situations .",
    "their results were extended by lafforgue @xcite to cover all uniform lattices in @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "chatterji @xcite showed then that lattices in @xmath76 and @xmath77 behave similarly .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for more information . a well - known application of property rd concerns the baum  connes conjecture without coefficient : by a theorem of lafforgue @xcite , groups which satisfy property rd together with some non positive curvature assumption ( called strong bolicity ) also satisfies the baum  connes without coefficient . for groups with property t , including most hyperbolic groups or cocompact lattices @xmath74 ( for instance ) , this is the only known approach to the baum  connes conjecture . ( the baum ",
    "connes conjecture is open for @xmath72 . )    in @xcite we studied  rank interpolation \" for countable groups , that is , interpolation of the rank in between the usual @xmath78 integer values .",
    "the main applications presented in @xcite are @xmath79-algebraic in nature and in particular , we established property rd for many groups of intermediate rank .",
    "this provided new examples where lafforgue s approach to the baum ",
    "connes could be applied ( in fact for many of these groups  e.g . for groups of rank @xmath80this",
    "is also the only approach that is presently known to work , and the baum - connes conjecture with coefficients is open ) .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for other results on intermediate rank and property rd .",
    "the accent in @xcite is on interpolating the rank between 1 and 2 , which includes a large class of groups of interest . in the present paper",
    "we will see that @xmath0 is also a group of intermediate rank , which interpolate the rank between 2 and 3 .",
    "the group @xmath0 admits the following presentation : @xmath81 the pure braid group @xmath82 is the kernel of the surjective homomorphism to the symmetric group on 4 letters , @xmath83 mapping a braid to the corresponding permutation of its endpoints .",
    "it is well - known that the center of both @xmath0 and @xmath82 is the cyclic group generated by the element @xmath84 , which consists in a full - twist braiding of the 4 strings ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 10.b ) for instance ; this is known to hold for more general artin groups @xcite ) . in other words @xmath0 is a central extension of the group @xmath85 by the groups of integers @xmath86 , which gives an exact sequence @xmath87 and in the same way , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a finite index subgroup of @xmath31 .",
    "the torsion in @xmath31 corresponds to the the conjugacy classes of the elements @xmath90 and @xmath91 and their powers , where we have @xmath92 ( see @xcite for a geometric proof of this fact ; recall that @xmath93 itself is torsion free ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath94 is torsion free .",
    "we will need some results of brady @xcite and their extensions in crisp  paoluzzi ( * ? ? ?",

    "let @xmath26 be classifying space of @xmath0 constructed in @xcite . as recalled in the introduction",
    ", @xmath26 is a cat(0 ) simplicial complex of dimension 3 whose 3-dimensional faces are euclidean tetrahedra .",
    "the authors of @xcite consider the projection in @xmath26 along the @xmath95-axis and obtain a 2-dimensional complex @xmath29 ( called the brady complex there ) together with an action of @xmath31 ( called the standard action , in view of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ) which commutes to the action of @xmath0 on @xmath96 under taking projection .",
    "the complex @xmath26 splits metrically as a product : @xmath97 and @xmath29 is endowed with an action of @xmath31 ( in section [ s4 ] we will give more details on these constructions ) .    as a cat(0 ) space",
    ", @xmath29 is a triangle polyhedron , i.e. its faces are equilateral triangles of the euclidean plane ( @xcite ) , and the action of @xmath31 on @xmath29 is proper with compact quotient .",
    "thus @xmath94 acts freely with compact quotient on @xmath29 , so @xmath94 appears as the fundamental group of the complex @xmath98 ( it can be shown that @xmath99 has 6 vertices and 32 faces ) .",
    "it follows then from theorem [ th3 ] that @xmath94 has property rd with respect to some ( hence any ) finite generating set . as @xmath94 is a finite index normal subgroup of @xmath31 this implies , by proposition 2.1.4 in @xcite , that @xmath31 itself has property rd .",
    "further results of jolissaint @xcite ( in particular proposition 2.1.9 of that paper , see also chatterji  pittet  saloff - coste ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 7.2 ) ) show that property rd is stable under certain types of central extensions .",
    "we will prove that these results can by applied to the present situation and this will conclude the proof of theorem [ th1 ] .    consider the section @xmath100 of the quotient map @xmath101 , which identifies @xmath31 as the subset of braids in @xmath0 whose central part is trivial .",
    "being a central extension of @xmath31 , we can decompose @xmath0 as a product @xmath102 where the value at a point @xmath103 of the cocycle @xmath104 defining the extension is the exponent of @xmath105 in the central element @xmath106 of @xmath31 .",
    "our goal is to find a symmetric finite generating set of @xmath31 such that , for the corresponding cayley graph @xmath107 of @xmath31 , we have @xmath108 for every elements @xmath109 at distance at most @xmath6 from the identity in @xmath107 . that this implies property rd for @xmath0 follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 7.2 ) .",
    "let us fix some notations regarding the thurston normal form for elements of @xmath0 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the braid group @xmath0 can be generated by a set @xmath54 of 23 elements , which are in bijective correspondence with the non trivial elements of the symmetric quotient @xmath111 .",
    "the half - twist @xmath56 belongs to @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore in this presentation , the monoid @xmath112 of positive braids is the submonoid of @xmath31 generated by @xmath54 , and every elements @xmath113 can be written in a canonical way @xmath114 called the greedy form of @xmath115 , where @xmath116 ( see @xcite , for instance one can consider the right greedy form where the element @xmath56 appears only on the right side of the expression @xmath117 ) .",
    "this decomposition can be extended to @xmath0 : by @xcite , every @xmath118 can be written as @xmath119 with @xmath120 , in a unique way ( after obvious cancellation in case both @xmath115 and @xmath121 start with the same element @xmath122 ) .",

    "if we denote by @xmath26 the cayley graph of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath128 , then @xmath129 is the length of a simplicial geodesic in @xmath26 from @xmath37 to @xmath118 .",

    "by definition , the value of @xmath141 is the exponent of @xmath95 in the central part of @xmath135 .",

    "we prove that the braid group @xmath0 and its central quotient @xmath171 are of exponential mesoscopic rank , respectively , in section [ 63 ] and section [ 62 ] .",
    "let us first recall in some more details the description of the brady action of @xmath0 on @xmath26 and its quotient action of @xmath31 on @xmath29 , following @xcite and @xcite .",

    "there are exactly sixteen ways to write @xmath125 as a product of three of the generators @xmath173 .",

    "then @xmath178 is the universal cover of @xmath99 with the corresponding deck - transformation action of @xmath0 .    the cat(0 )",

    "the image of each tetrahedron in @xmath26 under this projection is an euclidean equilateral triangle in @xmath29 and the action of @xmath0 factors out to a simplicial action of @xmath179 on @xmath29 , which is proper and cocompact .",
    "the cayley graph of @xmath31 with respect to the generating set @xmath180 ( where the above @xmath173 are viewed as elements of @xmath31 under a slight abuse of notation ) is a 4-to-1 cover of the 1-skeleton of @xmath29 .",

    "this follows from the fact that every vertex of valence of 3 in @xmath186 is adjacent to a vertex of valence 2 , and the vertices with valence 2 are at distance @xmath193 one from the other .",
