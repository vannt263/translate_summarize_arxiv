    "the calculation of the inductance of an ideal solenoid , @xmath0 is a standard part of any introductory level college physics course . here , @xmath1 denotes inductance , @xmath2 is the permeability of free space , @xmath3 the number of turns of the solenoid , @xmath4 its length and @xmath5 its cross - sectional area .",
    "ideal _ solenoid is one that is infinitely long , i.e. we are assuming that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is any length characterizing the cross - sectional area .    if the said course is calculus - based , the calculation of the inductance of a toroid with rectangular cross - section ( fig.[toroid ] ) will often be among the end - of - chapter problems , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the result of that calculation is     [ toroid ]    @xmath8    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are as above , @xmath7 and @xmath9 are the inner and outer radii , respectively , of the toroid , and @xmath10 its height .",
    "one might wonder , in fact , an occasional student will ask ; if a toroid can not be considered as a solenoid bent into a circle . of course , this must be a good approximation at least in _ some _ limit ; and comparing ( [ l_solenoid ] ) and ( [ l_toroid ] ) tells us that putting @xmath11 will give us an approximation for the natural logarithm .",
    "we will get @xmath12 now , the area of the solenoid bent into the circle is @xmath13 , and its length is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is some kind of average of @xmath7 and @xmath9 , which we denote by @xmath16 . defining @xmath17 and using the necessary property of linearity of any definition of average , we have @xmath18 this is our main result",
    ". any reasonable definition of average will give a particular approximation .",
    "in the next section , we will give three such special cases .",
    "we start with the most familiar concept of average , the arithmetic one , .",
    "this gives @xmath19 the geometric average gives @xmath20 and the harmonic average @xmath21 results in @xmath22 while the approximation ( [ approx_geom ] ) is not a rational function due to the presence of the factor @xmath23 , the approximations ( [ approx_artm ] ) and ( [ approx_harm ] ) are ; i.e. they are fractions of polynomials .",
    "in fact , when aproximating a function , such an expression is called a _ pad approximant _  @xcite .",
    "another common type of average is the weighted average , but no clear motivation exists for weighting the inner and outer radius of the toroid differently , nor are there any guidelines for what the weighting factors would be ; so we do not use this average at this point . on the other hand ,",
    "the harmonic average ( [ harm_avg ] ) can be seen as a special weighted average , where each number is weighted by the other .",
    "if an approximation is needed for a function , the immediate impulse , almost reflex , of a physicist is to use a taylor series . however , when we construct the taylor series of the function we are interested in here , @xmath24 , around @xmath25 ( the point @xmath25 is dictated by our problem : @xmath26 , since @xmath27 ) , and make plots of the taylor polynomials ( truncated taylor series , henceforth occasionally abbreviated as tp s ) , we see that at @xmath28-values beyond 2.5 , the polynomials are totally useless ( fig.[all_init ] ) ; in fact , the higher the number of terms taken , the worse a representation of the function the series is . on the other hand , our approximations ( [ approx_artm ] ) , ( [ approx_geom ] ) and ( [ approx_harm ] )",
    "are also shown on that figure , and they perform much better in that range .",
    "( red ) , the first 13 taylor polynomials of that function around @xmath25 , and the three approximants ( blue ) of this work .",
    "the @xmath28-range is about five units.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ all_init ]    contrast this behavior of the taylor polynomials with the corresponding case for the function @xmath29 ( fig.[sin ] ) : here , the higher the order of the polynomial , the later it peels off from the curve of @xmath30 , i.e. by increasing the order of the polynomial , we can find one that will be a good approximation in any desired range around the origin .",
    "( red ) , the first 7 taylor polynomials of that function around @xmath31 .",
    "the taylor polynomials are labeled by their orders.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ sin ]    the difference comes from the convergence properties of the respective taylor series : the series for @xmath32 converges for all @xmath28 , while for @xmath33 , around @xmath25 , the radius of convergence @xmath34 is 1 , as can be shown with standard techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , an upper limit of 1 on @xmath34 could have been guessed without calculation , by noting the singularity of the function at @xmath35 .",
    "this tells us that for this particular function , the taylor series expanded around @xmath25 is meaningless for @xmath36 , hence , other approximations are needed . while taylor series around other @xmath37 values can be constructed , they necessitate calculation of @xmath38 first ; the approximation scheme ( [ approx_main ] ) provides a neat alternative . comparing to the tp s around @xmath25 ; already at @xmath39 , the geometric approximant is better than the first 13 tp s , and at @xmath40 , now sounding very naturally , all three realizations of ( [ approx_main ] ) are ( fig.[near2 ] ) .",
    "the error of these approximants increases monotonically with @xmath28 , since the solenoid ( @xmath41 constant magnetic field inside ) approximation for the toroid becomes monotonically worse with @xmath28 ; the error of the geometric approximant is % 2 at @xmath42 , % 5 at @xmath43 , % 11 at @xmath44 and % 24 at @xmath45 , still usable for some purposes . at large @xmath28 values ,",
    "the approximants tend to 2 , @xmath23 and @xmath46 , respectively , and become useless .",
    "( red ) , the first 13 taylor polynomials of that function around @xmath25 , and the three approximants ( blue ) of this work , shown near @xmath42.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ near2 ]    while the motivation for the scheme ( [ approx_main ] ) has @xmath26 as a built - in feature , we can also check the region between @xmath35 and @xmath47 . for most of this region ,",
    "the fifth and higher order taylor polynomials are better than all three of our approximants , the geometric approximant is of comparable accuracy to the fourth order tp ( near @xmath48 , tp4 is better , near @xmath49 , the approximant ) , followed by the arithmetic one , the third order tp and the harmonic approximant , in this order .",
    "the error of the geometric approximant increases to % 5 near @xmath49 ( fig.[near05 ] ) .",
    "( red ) , the first 13 taylor polynomials of that function around @xmath25 , and the three approximants ( blue ) of this work , shown near @xmath50.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ near05 ]    near @xmath47 , that is , for @xmath51 , the taylor poynomials are good approximations , as our reflexes tell us ; in fact , the closer to @xmath47 we are , the shorter the taylor polynomial adequate for a given level of accuracy .",
    "however , the accuracy of all three of our approximants also increases towards perfection as we near @xmath47 from either direction , so in this region also , they are eminently usable . on the other hand ,",
    "the singularity at @xmath35 can not be exhibited by any of the taylor polynomials , while the geometric and harmonic approximants do a visually good job of it , even if the errors are large .",
    "one final note is that , having seen the behavior of the approximants ( figs .",
    "[ all_init ] and [ near2 ] ) , some kind of average of the geometric and arithmetic averages will give a more accurate closed - expression result .",
    "for example , their geometric average , @xmath52 has only % 6 error at @xmath45 , and the error could be decreased even more by weighting the factors .",
    "but the higher accuracy of expression ( [ approx_4 ] ) and analogous ones comes at the cost of losing some of the simplicity of expressions ( [ approx_main ] ) , ( [ approx_artm ] ) , ( [ approx_geom ] ) and ( [ approx_harm ] ) .",
    "starting from the reasonable assumption that a toroid can in _ some _ limit be thought of as a solenoid bent into a circle , we derived the simple and neat approximation scheme ( [ approx_main ] ) for the natural logarithm function .",
    "every reasonable definition of the average of two numbers will give a particular realization of the scheme , and we exhibited three such approximants , using the most common types of average . among the three , the approximant based on the geometric average , ( [ approx_geom ] ) , is the best performer , with % 5 error at @xmath49 and @xmath43 , the error decreasing monotonically down to zero as @xmath47 is approached from either side .",
    "these approximants are much simpler expressions than multi - term taylor polynomials around @xmath25 , which do not make sense for @xmath53 in any case , and their accuracy is competitive with said polynomials for the interval @xmath54 , as well .",
    "they could be combined for more accurate approximations , at the cost of losing some of the simplicity .",
