    "the cross - section for deep - inelastic charged lepton@xmath8proton scattering depends on the two independent structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "the former is dominated by the quark parton distributions , and the latter , in principle , by the gluon distribution ( except at high @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , @xmath9 is found to be much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , they appear in the cross - section in the combination [ eq : sigred ] ( x , q^2 ) = f_2(x , q^2 ) -f_l(x , q^2 ) , where @xmath10 .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 has become known as the `` reduced cross - section '' . since @xmath12 in",
    "most of the kinematic range , @xmath11 is effectively the same as @xmath9 .",
    "however , at hera , for the lowest @xmath2-values at given @xmath3 , the value of @xmath1 can become as large as @xmath13 , and the effect of @xmath4 becomes apparent @xcite .",
    "this is seen in the data as a flattening of the growth of @xmath11 as @xmath2 decreases to very small values ( for fixed @xmath3 ) , leading eventually to a turnover . hence , when analysing the hera structure function data it is particularly important to fit any theoretical prediction to the measured @xmath11 , rather than to model - dependent extracted values of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "indeed , important lessons may be learned by placing particular emphasis on the data at very high @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we examine the impact of the contribution from @xmath4 in this region .    as well as this",
    "very low @xmath2 hera data , we will also study the impact of the much higher @xmath2 direct measurements of @xmath4 , which were made by slac @xcite , bcdms @xcite and nmc @xcite by measuring the cross - section at a variety of values of @xmath1 . in this region",
    "the contribution from both quarks and gluons is obviously important , as indeed it turns out to be at the low-@xmath2 values .",
    "it has recently been proposed to make a direct determination of @xmath0 at the low-@xmath2 values accessible at hera by making some measurements of the cross - sections with lowered beam energy @xcite .",
    "there is also a possibility of a measurement associated with erhic @xcite .",
    "we conclude by discussing the importance of such future measurements .",
    "= 0.7    [ fig : stab ]    we have recently been able to make accurate and reliable predictions of @xmath4 up to nnlo in perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "the procedure is to first determine the parton distribution functions from a global fit to the available deep inelastic and related hard scattering data , without the inclusion of any @xmath0 data .",
    "for instance , the gluon distribution is constrained at small @xmath2 by measurements of @xmath14 , and at large @xmath2 by tevatron jet data .",
    "the extracted partons are then used to predict @xmath0 . in this way we can study the perturbative stability of this fundamental quantity as one increases the order of the calculation .",
    "the results obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] .",
    "it is immediately clear that at nlo there is a serious problem with @xmath4 at the lowest values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with it becoming ( unphysically ) negative .",
    "this is a reflection of the behaviour of the gluon distribution at the same order .",
    "however , the nnlo coefficient functions for @xmath4 , @xmath15 , turn out to be large and positive at small @xmath2 ( for both quarks and gluons ) . in detail",
    "f_l=_s(c_lg^lo+_s c_lg^nlo+_s^2 c_lg^nnlo+ ... ) g  +  g q where up to nlo the shape of @xmath4 is dominated by that of the partons , particularly the gluon at low @xmath2 .",
    "( @xmath16 is divergent at small @xmath2 , but the @xmath17 term has a very small , negative coefficient . ) the nnlo longitudinal coefficient function @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 there is clearly a significant positive contribution at very small @xmath2 , @xmath20 , and this counters the decrease in the small-@xmath2 gluon .",
    "hence , even though the gluon is even more negative at small @xmath2 and @xmath3 at nnlo than it is at nlo , the prediction for @xmath4 has become positive .",
    "indeed , the effect of the nnlo coefficient functions is so important , at low @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that @xmath4 starts to increase as @xmath2 decreases below about @xmath21 . at higher @xmath3 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath22 , the nlo and nnlo predictions are not too dissimilar at small @xmath2 , though the current very close agreement at @xmath23 is coincidental .",
    "= 0.6    [ fig : sigred ]    this predicted increase in @xmath4 is very important for the comparison with the high-@xmath1 hera @xmath24 data .",
    "the very small , or even negative , values at nlo mean that there is no turn - over in the theoretical curves to accompany that in the data , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigred ] . however , the discrepancy is cured at nnlo , and the comparison with @xmath11 is quite good .",
    "in fact , if the nnlo @xmath25 gluon distribution were positive definite at input ( @xmath26 ) the resulting @xmath4 would be rather too large at the smallest @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the turnover in @xmath11 would be too large .",
    "( also the shape of @xmath4 with @xmath3 at small @xmath2 would be very strange , growing quickly as @xmath3 decreases . )",
    "this illustrates the fact that the small-@xmath2 gluon is a scheme - dependent , unphysical quantity , which in the @xmath25 scheme is very unlike the physical @xmath4 .",
    "bearing this in mind , we attempted to construct a more `` physical '' definition for the small-@xmath2 gluon , in a similar spirit to that we used recently for the high-@xmath2 gluon @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we invented a scheme where the gluon was defined by [ eq : phys ] g^f_l(x , q^2 ) = ( ( 1-x)+)g^(x , q^2 ) , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are functions identical to the nlo and nnlo coefficient functions in the small-@xmath2 limit , but modified at high-@xmath2 so that momentum is conserved in the transformation between schemes .",
    "if the exact coefficient functions were used in eq.([eq : phys ] ) then the `` physical '' definition of the gluon , @xmath29 would be guaranteed to be the same shape as @xmath4 at small @xmath2 , and hence would have a genuine physical interpretation in this scheme . however",
    ", performing fits where we defined as input @xmath30 and transformed to the @xmath25 scheme ( as we defined the high-@xmath2 gluon in dis scheme before transforming to the @xmath25 scheme in @xcite ) we found that @xmath29 still tended to be valence - like or even negative at small @xmath2 . this is because the exact @xmath31 , and particularly @xmath32 , do not have zero first moment , i.e. are not momentum conserving , and in fact using the real coefficients in eq.([eq : phys ] ) would leads to a considerably larger value of @xmath29 than momentum conserving functions can .",
    "hence , we conclude that it is not easy to devise a simple scheme where the low-@xmath2 gluon behaves like @xmath4 , but where the interpretation in terms of parton distribution functions as probabilities is clearly maintained .",
    "we conclude that even though the nnlo prediction for @xmath4 is much better than that at nlo , there are still problems .",
    "perturbation theory does not seem to be converging for this quantity at low @xmath2 and @xmath3 . indeed , there have previously been suggestions that small-@xmath2 resummations may play an important role in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , there also appears to be a problem at higher @xmath2 .",
    "the comparison of theory to data for @xmath4 is not satisfactory for the higher-@xmath2 direct measurements of @xmath4 . indeed , when we perform new global fits including the @xmath0 data , we find @xmath33 of @xmath34 for the @xmath35 @xmath0 points at nlo , with a definite tendency for data to lie above theory .",
    "there is a big improvement at nnlo , with the corrections being large and positive , and the @xmath33 is @xmath36 .",
    "however , there is still a tendency for data to lie a bit above theory .",
    "a comparison between data and theory is shown in fig.[fig : direct ] . in any case at high @xmath2 it is likely that higher twist is an important contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "= 0.7    [ fig : direct ]",
    "the paucity of data for @xmath4 , as compared with the case for @xmath9 , means that it is not possible to perform the entirely phenomenological analysis of higher twist that we performed for the latter @xcite , i.e. to include a higher twist correction of the form @xmath37 where we allowed @xmath38 to be independent parameters representing 13 bins in @xmath2 .",
    "similar in spirit to this in @xcite which has only one @xmath39 bin .",
    "it also predates the calculation of the nnlo coefficient functions for @xmath4 . ] for @xmath4 the number of bins would have to be much smaller to avoid having gaps , or having only 1 or 2 points in a bin .",
    "hence , we appeal to theoretical motivation for our choice of the higher - twist correction . for the case of the nonsinglet higher - twist contribution to @xmath9 , a correction of the form",
    "@xmath37 has long been suspected to be enhanced by @xmath40 at high @xmath2 .",
    "it also must satisfy the adler sum rule , and hence vanish as @xmath41 .",
    "the renormalon calculation @xcite has exactly this trend , as indeed does the phenomenological higher twist extracted by a global fit @xcite .",
    "in particular there seems to be no evidence for a large contribution beyond the nonsinglet contribution , and renormalon calculations are problematical for such extra contributions @xcite .    for @xmath4",
    "there is no reason to expect the same type of enhancement at high @xmath2 , and also no reason for the higher - twist contribution to vanish at low @xmath2 . in this case",
    "a correction of the approximate form @xmath42 is expected , where @xmath43 is constant .",
    "again the renormalon calculation is in reasonable agreement with the naive prediction @xcite , giving a nonsinglet contribution of @xmath44 this , and similar expressions are often presented with @xmath9 on the right - hand side .",
    "however , it is strictly the quarks that should appear , with the coefficient functions containing the appropriate quark - squared weighting , this combination of quark distributions and charge - squared weighting then being identical to the lo expression for @xmath9 .",
    "the overall normalisation @xmath45 has been estimated to be @xmath46 @xcite , but this is uncertain , and its value can also vary enormously by choosing @xmath47 defined at different orders . in @xcite the generous nlo value and @xmath48 . ] of @xmath49 was taken , giving a large higher - twist correction with @xmath50 .",
    "was defined to be the coefficient of the whole higher - twist term for the first moment rather than the coefficient of the @xmath2-dependent function , hence the value of @xmath51 was quoted . ]",
    "= 0.66    [ fig : renorm ]    here we perform global fits including both the direct data on @xmath4 and the indirect high @xmath1 data from hera , in which we allow @xmath45 to be a free parameter . at both nlo and nnlo the quality of the fit to both the direct and the hera data improves . for the direct data we get @xmath52 at nlo and one better at nnlo .",
    "the values @xmath53 and @xmath54 are found at nlo and nnlo respectively , each with an error of @xmath55 .",
    "the quality of the fit to direct data is shown in fig.[fig : direct ] , and the effect of the higher - twist contribution to @xmath4 can be seen from fig.[fig : renorm ] .",
    "the values of @xmath45 preferred by fitting only to the hera data are larger ( @xmath56 at nlo(nnlo ) ) , but this makes @xmath4 too large for the best fit to the direct data .",
    "we also tried a fit with a simpler form of the higher - twist correction @xmath57 this lead to no changes of any significance .",
    "the fit is of essentially the same quality .",
    "the value of @xmath45 increases by a factor of 3 , which is exactly what one gets if one takes the small-@xmath2 limit of eq.([eq : renormalon ] ) .",
    "this shows that except at very high @xmath2 the correction in eq.([eq : renormalon ] ) reduces to that in eq.([eq : renormalona ] ) with @xmath58 times the normalization .",
    "this is easily understood . in moment",
    "space the multiplicative factor in eq.([eq : renormalon ] ) is @xmath59 ( using the convention in @xcite ) , which in the small-@xmath2 ( @xmath60 ) limit becomes @xmath58 .",
    "we can also investigate the size of the renormalon correction by further examination of the formulae in @xcite .",
    "the renormalon correction is obtained from taking the pole contributions of the inverse borel transformation of eq.(20 ) in @xcite .",
    "this then gives the term in eq .",
    "( 23 ) in @xcite , but with an uncertain normalization .",
    "alternatively one can derive the perturbative expansion in the naive non - abelianization limit by expanding eq .",
    "( 20 ) in powers of @xmath61 , the borel conjugate variable to @xmath3 , and performing the inverse transformation term - by - term . doing this in moment space for their @xmath62 , i.e. the conventional @xmath63 ( small-@xmath2 limit ) , we find , for @xmath64 , successive lo , nlo , nnlo , ... contributions moment of the quark coefficient function .",
    "thus , the moment of the quark contribution to @xmath0 ( which should be dominant at highish @xmath2 , and is in practice important at all @xmath2 at low @xmath3 ) is the sum of the series multiplied by the moment of the quark distribution . ]",
    "0.0765 + 0.052 + 0.043 + 0.043 + 0.050 + ...  , i.e. the lo coefficient function for @xmath64 is @xmath65 , the nlo correction in the large @xmath66 limit is @xmath67 the nnlo contribution in the same limit is @xmath68 _ etc_. hence , for @xmath64 , which corresponds to @xmath69 , the nnlo and nnnlo term are roughly the same and we are led to keep three perturbative terms , with @xmath68 being an estimate of the higher twist . indeed ,",
    "if one evaluates the finite part , i.e. the principal value , of eq.(23 ) in @xcite one gets @xmath70 ( to be compared with @xmath71 ) as the perturbative contribution with the renormalon correction taken out , which is very consistent .    repeating this procedure for @xmath72 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath73 , one gets 0.064 + 0.036 + 0.025 + 0.021 + 0.020 + 0.023 + ...  .",
    "now @xmath74lo is still smaller than nnlo , and perhaps @xmath75lo is representative of the overall higher - twist contribution , i.e. @xmath76 , which is about half of @xmath68 , consistent with a @xmath77 dependence when @xmath3 goes from @xmath78 . in this case ,",
    "explicit evaluation of the principle value of eq.(23 ) gives @xmath79 , to be compared with 0.146 ( the sum of the first four terms ) .",
    "again we have consistency , but where the series should be truncated is a function of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the term one includes at higher @xmath3 is rather small .",
    "since the renormalon term is @xmath80 then at @xmath62 our higher twist should be @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath82 we therefore have @xmath83 , that is @xmath84 .",
    "this should be compared with the values @xmath85 and @xmath54 obtained in our nlo and nnlo fits .",
    "however , it is clear that the nlo value is too high because it is missing significant nnlo corrections , whereas perhaps all the correction to nnlo should be higher twist . in this case",
    "the fitted value of @xmath86 compares well with the approximate prediction of @xmath87 , especially considering that the fit to hera data alone favours @xmath88 .",
    "considering the variation with @xmath89 , or equivalently with @xmath2 , leads to complications however .",
    "the higher - twist correction at @xmath62 ( that is the conventional @xmath63 ) is @xmath81 , whereas at larger @xmath89 it tends to @xmath90 .",
    "this might suggest that at a fixed @xmath3 a particular term in the series , e.g nnlo at @xmath64 , increases with increasing @xmath89 , saturating at 3 times its @xmath62 value at large @xmath89 .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "in fact the nnlo term is slowly varying with @xmath89 , and actually decreases for very large @xmath89 . for example , for @xmath91 and @xmath64",
    "we get 0.0218 + 0.0297 + 0.0404 + 0.056 + ..... i.e. the nnlo term is slightly smaller than at @xmath62 ; but note that we now have no convergence .",
    "we have to go to higher @xmath3 to get any evidence of convergence .",
    "if we take , for example , @xmath92 ( corresponding to @xmath93 ) then for @xmath91 we have 0.0145 + 0.0132 + 0.0120 + 0.0111 + 0.0109 + 0.0114 + ...  .",
    "so at this scale there is some convergence .",
    "compare this to the same @xmath3 for @xmath62 , 0.0508 + 0.0233 + 0.0129 + 0.0085 + 0.0066 + 0.0061 + 0.0065 + ...  .",
    "here we would keep 5 or 6 terms in the series and the higher - twist contribution is 0.0065 ( compared to @xmath94 , which is not too bad ) .",
    "however at @xmath91 we would keep 4 or 5 terms and the higher twist is @xmath95 .",
    "so at the higher @xmath3 the picture is reasonably consistent , though arguably we should treat more terms as perturbative at low @xmath2 than at high @xmath2 , and the higher - twist term enters at about 6th or 7th order . on the other hand , at low @xmath3 we can not say that the higher twist is roughly nnnlo .",
    "this is the case at low @xmath2 , but at high @xmath2 the situation is confused .",
    "if we evaluate the inverse transformation explicitly for @xmath91 and @xmath64 we find @xmath96 for the perturbative contribution , which implies keeping something like just the lo term with nlo representing the size of the higher twist , two orders lower than at lower @xmath89 and @xmath2 .",
    "however the size of the higher twist is then not quantitatively consistent .",
    "we conclude that the high @xmath2 and low @xmath3 domain is `` dangerous '' .",
    "this is another reason , along with target mass , to avoid fitting data in this kinematic region . for @xmath92 ( that is @xmath93 )",
    "the explicit integral gives @xmath97 for @xmath91 , consistent with keeping the first five terms .",
    "for @xmath62 it gives @xmath98 , again roughly corresponding to the first 5 terms .",
    "hence , as long as we stay away from high @xmath89 combined with low @xmath3 everything is consistent .",
    "nevertheless , at high @xmath89 and low @xmath3 one can still get some idea of what is happening , i.e. the whole perturbative expansion is difficult to distinguish from higher twist , but the problem is that there is no quantitative approach applicable in this ( high @xmath2 , low @xmath3 ) domain .",
    "= 0.7    [ fig : theory ]    there is much to learn from the inclusion of the data which are both directly , and indirectly , sensitive to @xmath4 in a global fit .",
    "there is clear evidence that nlo in perturbation theory alone is not a sufficiently sophisticated approach to fit either the direct or indirect data .",
    "there is an improvement from including the recently calculated nnlo corrections , but still some significant problems .",
    "the further inclusion of a higher - twist contribution , inspired by the renormalon correction in the nonsinglet sector , is very successful , and the normalization of this contribution seems to be consistent with the theoretical expectations .",
    "however , there is still room for further theoretical corrections , particularly at low @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "there are numerous suggestions that even higher orders in perturbation theory are important here due to the large @xmath99 terms . indeed",
    ", the nnnlo coefficient functions calculated in @xmath25 scheme in the latter paper of @xcite lead to large corrections for @xmath82 and @xmath100 , and studies including resummations suggest important modifications in this region for @xmath4 , see , for example , @xcite . the same is true for studies using dipole models @xcite which contain both higher - order corrections and higher twists ( different from those in the renormalon correction considered here ) .",
    "a variety of predictions from different theoretical approaches is shown in fig.[fig : theory ] .",
    "a direct measurement of @xmath4 for @xmath22 would be very important in determining which theoretical approaches are most reliable , as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
