    "the tidal gravitational accelerations experienced by a steady beam of ultrarelativistic particles rapidly moving with respect to a rotating source along different directions was investigated by mashhoon and mcclune @xcite in the field of a rotating source and in connection with the physics of jets .",
    "they considered only gravitational accelerations and argued that the general enhancement of tidal effects could destroy the collimation of the beam and results in the dissipation of the energy of the jet via tidal gravitational radiation , except along special tidal directions as the rotation axis of a collapsed configuration .    in a number of papers",
    "@xcite chicone and mashhoon studied the tidal dynamics of relativistic flows near black holes .",
    "they investigated the motion of a swarm of free particles ( in both non - relativistic and relativistic regime ) relative to a free reference particle moving on a radial escape trajectory .",
    "they found that if the relative speed exceeds a certain critical value , the first order gravitational tidal effects cause an acceleration / deceleration of the ultrarelativistic particles in the swarm moving in directions normal / parallel to the jet direction .",
    "de felice and coworkers @xcite ( see also references therein ) investigated the conditions for axial collimation of beams emitted near a kerr black hole .",
    "they considered the so called vortical \" orbits @xcite , i.e. geodesics which spiral around the symmetry axis without crossing the equatorial plane .",
    "they found that such a family of particle trajectories collimate towards the rotation axis as a consequence of a constrained variation of their energy and angular momentum , provided the variation was slow enough to preserve the geodesic character of the orbits .",
    "in the present paper we study the relative behaviour of a bunch of particles constrained to move parallel to the axis of symmetry of a kerr black hole under the combined effects of a given acceleration and of the background curvature .",
    "ultrarelativistic particles are expected to be produced near highly magnetized rapidly rotating neutron stars or as a consequence of the complicated accretion phenomena in the vicinity of an active black hole ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the flow of particles escaping away from the central source and generating polar jets out to the observed distances appears to be governed by electromagnetic interactions or magnetohydrodynamics . for our purposes",
    ", we imagine an abundance of such particles near the poles of the collapsed system . in the case of axial acceleration",
    "we find that curvature and inertial strains compete to the formation of jet - like structures from an initial spherical configuration .",
    "the result crucially depends on the property of the curvature to remain finite under ultrarelativistic boost along the axis of symmetry of kerr spacetime , i.e. approaching a principal null direction of the spacetime itself @xcite .",
    "the limitations and further developments of this analysis are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "we want to stress that we neither propose a specific model of jets nor make any assumption about the physical processes that are responsible for the initial acceleration , but only discuss in detail a general relativistic kinematical effect that should be considered in any jet model which assumes as a driving machine a rotating black hole .    in this paper greek indices",
