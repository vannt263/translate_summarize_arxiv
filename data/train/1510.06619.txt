    "the study of a singular initial value problems modelled by second - order non - linear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) on a semi - infinite domain have attracted many mathematicians and physicists .",
    "one of the equations in this category is the following lane - emden type equation : @xmath1 with initial conditions : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are real constants and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are some given continuous real - valued functions . for special forms of @xmath8",
    ", the well - known lane - emden equations occur in several models of non - newtonian fluid mechanics , mathematical physics , astrophysics , etc @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath9 , the lane - emden equations occur in modelling several phenomena in mathematical physics and astrophysics such as the theory of stellar structure , the thermal behaviour of a spherical cloud of gas , isothermal gas sphere and theory of thermionic currents @xcite .",
    "+ let @xmath10 denote the total pressure at a distance @xmath11 from the center of spherical gas cloud .",
    "the total pressure is due to the usual gas pressure and a contribution from radiation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the radiation constant , the absolute temperature , the gas constant , and the specific volume , respectively @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be the mass within a sphere of radius @xmath11 and @xmath18 the constant of gravitation .",
    "the equilibrium equation for the configuration are @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 , is the density , at a distance @xmath11 , from the center of a spherical star @xcite . eliminating @xmath22 yields of these equations results in the following equation , which as should be noted , is an equivalent form of the poisson equation @xcite : @xmath23 we already know that in the case of a degenerate electron gas , the pressure and density are @xmath24 ,",
    "assuming that such a relation exists for other states of the star , we are led to consider a relation of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants .",
    "we can insert this relation into eq . for the hydrostatic equilibrium condition and , from this , we can rewrite the equation as follows : @xmath28\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{d}{d r}(r^{2}\\frac{d y}{d r})=-y^{m},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 represents the central density of the star and @xmath30 denotes the dimensionless quantity , which are both related to @xmath21 through the following relation @xcite : @xmath31 and let @xmath32 @xmath33^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] inserting these relations into our previous relation we obtain the lane - emden equation @xcite : @xmath34 now",
    ", we will have the standard lane - emden equation with @xmath35 @xmath36 at this point , it is also important to introduce the boundary conditions which are based upon the following boundary conditions for hydrostatic equilibrium and normalization consideration of the newly introduced quantities @xmath37 and @xmath30 .",

    "the main difficulty in analysing this type of equation is the singularity behaviour occurring at @xmath43 . +",
    "as it has been mentioned in the literature review , the solutions of the lane - emden equation could be exact only for @xmath44 and 5 .",
    "for the other values of @xmath27 , the lane - emden equation is to be integrated numerically @xcite .",
    "thus , we decided to present a new and efficient technique to solve it numerically for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "many problems in science and engineering arise in unbounded domains .",
    "different numerical methods have been proposed for solving problems on unbounded domains@xcite .",
    "+ recently , many analytical methods have been used to solve lane - emden equations , the main difficulty arises in the singularity of the equation at @xmath47 . currently , most techniques in use for handling the lane - emden - type problems are based on either series solutions or perturbation techniques .",

    "@xcite used quasi - linearization approach to solve lane - emden equation .",
    "this method approximates the solution of a non - linear differential equation by treating the non - linear terms as a perturbation about the linear ones , and unlike perturbation theories is not based on the existence of some kind of a small parameter .",
    "he showed that the quasi - linearization method gives excellent results when applied to different non - linear ordinary differential equations in physics , such as the blasius , duffing , lane - emden and thomas - fermi equations . + shawagfeh @xcite applied a non - perturbative approximate analytical solution for the lane - emden equation using the adomian decomposition method , his solution was in the form of a power series .",

    "+ in @xcite , wazwaz employed the adomian decomposition method with an alternate framework designed to overcome the difficulty of the singular point .",
    "it was applied to the differential equations of lane - emden type .",
    "+ later on @xcite he used the modified decomposition method for solving analytical treatment of non - linear differential equations such as lane - emden equations .",

    "later , he developed piecewise - adaptive decomposition methods for the solution of non - linear ordinary differential equations .",
    "piecewise - decomposition methods provide series solutions in intervals which are subject to continuity conditions at the end points of each interval and their adoption is based on the use of either a fixed number of approximants and a variable step size , a variable number of approximants and a fixed step size or a variable number of approximants and a variable step size . + in @xcite , series solutions of the lane - emden equations based on either a volterra integral equations formulation or the expansion of the dependent variable in the original ordinary differential equations are presented and compared with series solutions obtained by means of integral or differential equations based on a transformation of the dependent variables .",
    "+ yousefi @xcite used integral operator and converted lane - emden equations to integral equations and then applied legendre wavelet approximations . in this work properties of legendre wavelet together with the gaussian integration method were utilized to reduce the integral equations to the solution of algebraic equations . by his method , the equations was formulated on [ 0 , 1 ] .",
    "+ chowdhury and hashim @xcite obtained analytical solutions of the generalized emden - fowler type equations in the second order ordinary differential equations by homotopy - perturbation method ( hpm ) .",
    "this method is a coupling of the perturbation method and the homotopy method .",
    "the main feature of the hpm @xcite is that it deforms a difficult problem into a set of problems which are easier to solve .",
    "hpm yields solution in convergent series forms with easily computable terms .",

    "+ the organization of the paper is as follows : + in section 2 , we briefly explain on the rbf , dq and rbf - dq methods . in section 3",
    "we applying the rbf - dq method and solving some lane - emden type equations.then , a comparison is made with the existing methods in the literature .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will show in detail the rbf - dq method .",
    "the rbf - differential quadrature ( dq ) method is an interpolation technique in which the radial basis functions are used as basis functions.so , it can be easily applied to the linear and non - linear problems . in the following , we will show the details of rbf - dq method step by step .",
    "the interpolation of a given set of points is an important problem especially in higher dimensional domains .",
    "although polynomials ( e.g. chebyshev and legendre ) are very powerful tools for interpolating of a set of points in one - dimensional domains , the use of these functions are not efficient in higher dimensional or irregular domains . while applying these functions , the points in the domain of the problem should be chosen in a special form , which is very limiting when the interpolation of a scattered set of points is needed .",
    "radial basis functions ( rbfs ) are very efficient instruments for interpolating a scattered set of points , which have been used in the last 20 years .",
    "the use of radial basis functions collocation method for solving partial differential equations has some advantages over mesh dependent methods , such as finite - difference methods , finite element methods , spectral elements , finite volume methods and boundary element methods .",
    "since a large portion of the computational time is spent for providing a suitable mesh on the domain of the problem in mesh - dependent methods , the meshfree methods have an auxiliary role in the numerical solution of partial differential equations . in recent years , to avoid the mesh generation , meshfree methods have attracted the attention of researchers .    in a meshless method , a set of scattered nodes is used instead of meshing the domain of the problem .",
    "rbfs were first studied by roland hardy , an iowa state geodesist , in 1968 .",
    "this method allows scattered data to be easily used in computations .",
    "an extensive study of interpolation methods available at the time was conducted by franke @xcite , who concluded that rbf interpolations were evaluated as the most accurate techniques .",
    "the theory of rbfs originated as a means to prepare a smooth interpolation of a discrete set of data points .",
    "the concept of using rbfs for solving differential equations ( des ) was first introduced by kansa @xcite , who directly collocated the radial basis functions for the approximate solution of des . however , in recent years rbfs have been extensively researched and applied in a wider range of analysis . partial differential equations ( pdes ) and ordinary differential equations ( odes ) have been solved using rbfs in recent work @xcite .",
    "a well - known space rbf @xmath51-@xmath52 depends on the separation of a field point @xmath53 and the data centers@xmath54 , for@xmath55 and n data points .",
    "the interpolants are classed as radial function due to their spherical symmetry around centres @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the well - known euclidean norm .",
    "the most known space rbfs are listed in table [ tabrbf ] , where r = @xmath51-@xmath58 and @xmath59 is a free positive parameter , often referred to as the shape parameter , to be specified by the user .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath59 within the gaussian and multiquadric rbfs requires fine tuning and can dramatically alter the quality of the interpolation",
    ". too large or too small shape parameter makes the ga too flat or too peaked . despite many research works , which are done to find algorithms for selecting the optimum values of @xmath60 @xcite",
    "the optimal choice of shape parameter is an open problem , which is still under intensive investigation .",
    "one of the most powerful interpolation methods with analytic d - dimensional test function is the space rbfs method , based on gaussian ( ga ) basis function @xmath61 in the cases of inverse quadratic , inverse multiquadric ( imq ) and gaussian ( ga ) , the coefficient matrix of rbfs interpolating is positive definite and , for multiquadric ( mq ) , it has one positive eigenvalue and the remaining ones are all negative @xcite .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the recent books and the paper written by buhmann @xcite and wendland @xcite for more basic details about rbfs , compactly and globally supported and convergence rate of the radial basis functions .",

    "the lane  emden equation describes a variety of phenomena in theoretical physics and astrophysics , including aspects of stellar structure , the thermal history of a spherical cloud of gas , isothermal gas spheres , and thermionic currents @xcite . since then the equation has been a center of attraction .",
