    "stars are universally observed to form in molecular clouds . indeed , recent observations have demonstrated that the surface density of star formation @xmath2 correlates linearly with the surface density of molecular hydrogen @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this has led to the suspicion that the formation of stars depends on the formation of molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "however , the opposite view has also been argued : that molecular clouds and then stars form from converging flows @xcite , primarily driven by large - scale gravitational instability @xcite . in this picture , the formation of molecules is a consequence , not a cause , of the conditions required to form stars .",
    "@xcite and @xcite added to the puzzle with the observation that in the inner parts of spiral galaxies the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen surface density @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the midplane pressure and @xmath6 is the surface density of h  i. in detail , they derived an empirical pressure dependence for @xmath0 that can be fit several different ways . taking a common fit to all their individual data points yields the fit @xcite @xmath7^{0.94\\pm 0.02},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 has units of k  @xmath9 .",
    "this result was extended by @xcite who studied a broad sample of spiral and dwarf galaxies from things , and gave the results in their table  6 .",
    "they found results quite consistent with equation  ( [ eq : press ] ) .    both @xcite and",
    "@xcite offered explanations of this observed correlation that rely on the equilibrium balance between radiative dissociation and h@xmath10 molecule formation on the surfaces of dust grains .",
    "@xcite built on the original suggestion by @xcite and @xcite that the midplane pressure in disk galaxies determines molecular cloud properties .",
    "they began with the calculation by @xcite that the equilibrium fraction of gas in the molecular phase @xmath11 depends on both the interstellar pressure and the radiation field @xmath12 as @xmath13 this equation was derived by assuming two populations of spherical clouds , one with constant density , representing diffuse clouds , and one with @xmath14 density profiles , representing hydrostatic , self - gravitating clouds .",
    "observations @xcite and turbulent models @xcite reveal that the distribution of densities among the diffuse clouds is continuous rather than the delta functions predicted by thermal phase transitions , demonstrating some of the limitations of this approach .    for low values of @xmath15 , the approximation @xmath16 can be made .",
    "@xcite then invoked the observed correlation @xmath17 , and assumed that the star formation rate determines the local radiation field directly ( @xmath18 ) to derive that @xmath19 however , the discussion in @xcite and @xcite neglects that this relationship does not hold for the high values of @xmath20 observed in some galaxies , as equation  ( [ fmol ] ) does not hold , nor does the approximation @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite calculate the equilibrium value of @xmath21 in a uniform - density , spherical gas cloud exposed to far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation .",
    "an essentially identical result was already derived for a slab model of a cloud by @xcite .",
    "they all demonstrate that the fraction depends on only two parameters .",
    "the first parameter is the characteristic dust optical depth @xmath22 of a cloud of radius @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei in the atomic gas , and @xmath25 is the cross section for dust absorption per hydrogen atom .",
    "the second parameter is the effective intensity of the ionizing radiation @xmath26 ( denoted @xmath27 by @xcite ) , where @xmath28 is the fraction of absorbed photons in the lyman - werner bands that result in dissociation , @xmath29 is the ambient flux of radiation in the lyman - werner bands , and @xmath30 is the rate coefficient for the formation of h@xmath10 on grains .    the effective intensity @xmath31 can be written in terms of the value of @xmath32 , the ratio of @xmath33 to the typical dissociating radiation field in the milky way of @xmath34 photons  @xmath35 @xcite , as @xmath36 where @xmath37  @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xmath40  s@xmath35 .",
    "both scaled constants are of order unity in the solar neighborhood . @xcite and @xcite go on to express @xmath31 in terms of the metallicity and the physical constants only , by assuming that the atomic gas is in two - phase thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , this second step is not required .",
    "not taking it allows application of their chemical model to a cloud of arbitrary density and ambient radiation field .",
    "these two papers then extend their approximation to compute @xmath21 in a spherical cloud composed of both atomic and molecular gas , by making the assumption that the atomic gas is in pressure equilibrium with the colder , denser molecular gas .",
    "this allows them to derive a fit to @xmath41 for the spherical gas cloud as a function solely of @xmath31 , @xmath42 , the dust cross section @xmath25 , and the mean mass per hydrogen nucleus @xmath43 . using the improved approximation given by @xcite , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where , @xmath46 and the optical depth through the atomic - molecular cloud @xmath47 . for @xmath48",
    ", @xmath49 is a better approximation .",
    "essentially this same relationship was used by @xcite to derive the star formation rate in galaxies , taking into account the observed correlation between molecular hydrogen and star formation surface density .",
    "but why should h@xmath10 exert such a strong influence on star formation ?",
    "although h@xmath10 is a coolant , it is effective only down to temperatures of 200  k , whereas atomic fine structure emission ( primarily from c@xmath50 ) can cool the gas down to temperatures of around 60  k in regions of low dust extinction , or as low as 15  k in more highly shielded regions where the photoelectric heating rate is small @xcite . to cool further , to the 10  k typical of most prestellar cores ,",
    "generally requires co , which indeed forms efficiently only in h@xmath10-rich gas .",
    "however , the difference between 20  k and 10  k can only slightly affect the star formation rate , as demonstrated by the recent simulations of @xcite .    on the other hand , gravitational instability produces dense gas that quickly forms h@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thus , h@xmath10 , and other molecules that form with it , such as co , may primarily just act to trace dense gas that is already gravitationally unstable and collapsing .",
    "@xcite present an analytic model for how the combination of dynamical and thermal equilibrium may lead to this situation , also yielding a prediction of the correlation between the molecular surface density and the midplane pressure based on the linear relation derived between radiation field strength and pressure .",
    "however , this model relies on the empirical correlation @xmath51 without offering a theoretical explanation for it .    in this paper",
    "we examine the evolution of the molecular hydrogen to atomic hydrogen ratio @xmath0 as a function of time and examine whether that evolution can explain its observed correlation with pressure , and thus its relationship to the star formation rate . to do this",
    ", we have incorporated a simplified , non - equilibrium , chemical network and radiative transfer model into a three - dimensional simulation of supersonic ( and super - alfvnic ) , magnetohydrodynamical turbulence .",
    "this allows us to follow the formation history of h@xmath10 , starting from turbulent , magnetized atomic gas @xcite .",
    "our models follow the interplay between the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and molecular gas at different average densities .",
    "they have velocity dispersions of 5  km  s@xmath35 , with resulting densities dispersed around the mean value by more than four orders of magnitude ( see fig . 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "although we do not explicitly model gravitational collapse , we do examine regions with varying average density , providing a first approximation to the sequence of quasi - static states that a large - scale , gravitationally contracting region will pass through",
    ". only a small fraction of the molecular gas will ever undergo full - scale gravitational collapse @xcite , with the rest remaining at pressures close to the surrounding atomic gas . because we do include the full suite of heating and cooling processes relevant for both cold atomic and molecular gas , our models offer insight into the behavior of the cold gas even on large scales .    at any particular time after molecules begin forming , we find that the molecular fraction @xmath0 varies primarily as a function of local gas volume density , almost independently of radiation field strength , except in diffuse regions with mean extinctions of @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the strong self - shielding of h@xmath10 means the rate - limiting step in denser regions is the slow formation of molecules on dust grains .",
    "significant mass fractions of the flow in these models become fully molecular in only a few million years @xcite , but molecule formation continues over periods exceeding 20  myr , comparable to cloud lifetimes .",
    "thus , equilibrium values of the molecular fraction can not be relied on .",
    "this is contrary to the behavior of co , whose fractional abundance is far more sensitive to the dust column density ( and thus radiation field strength ) than to the volume density , because of its much weaker ability to self - shield @xcite .    if molecular clouds rarely or never reach equilibrium , then what determines the observed molecular fraction ?",
    "the hypothesis that global star formation is controlled by gravitational instability of the gaseous disk has been considered at least since the calculation of the gravitational instability criterion in such disks by @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite , and @xcite supported this idea , demonstrating that it naturally could explain observations of both global @xcite and local @xcite correlations between gas surface density and star formation rate . the clumpy nature of high - redshift galaxies",
    "can also be explained by this hypothesis @xcite . molecular cloud formation as a by product of gravitational instability has been argued to be a natural consequence of this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the key timescale is the free - fall time @xmath53 at the local average density @xmath54 .",
    "we show that our non - equilibrium models indeed predict the observed molecular fractions to occur after a free - fall time at the average density in each model .    in section  [ sec : numerics ]",
    "we describe our numerical method and the models that we ran .",
    "we then offer a simple analytical model of molecular hydrogen formation in section  [ sec : explanation ] and discuss how it succeeds and fails in comparison to the full numerical results . in section  [ sec : comparisons ] we compare our results to equilibrium models and the observations , while in section  [ sec : discussion ] we offer caveats and consider the implications of our results .",
    "to study the formation of molecular hydrogen from atomic hydrogen , we use mesoscale simulations of turbulent , magnetized , atomic gas incorporating a non - equilibrium chemical network , including an approximation to the background dissociating radiation field . in order to resolve the turbulent flow sufficiently well to follow the formation of h@xmath10",
    ", we neglect the large scale structure of the interstellar medium , and instead simulate periodic boxes with side length @xmath5520 pc having defined average initial number density @xmath56 ( and other parameters such as metallicity @xmath57 , turbulent velocity dispersion , and magnetic flux ) .",
    "we use a version of zeus - mp @xcite modified to include a subcycled chemical model and the associated radiative and chemical heating and cooling .",
    "the method was described in detail in @xcite but for the models presented here we explore a wider range of initial conditions and run several of the simulations for considerably longer .",
    "radiative transfer is included using a six - ray approximation , with column densities measured from the edges of the cube @xcite .",
    "although this is not strictly self - consistent , it does capture the basic dynamics of radiative dissociation well ( also see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "all of the models presented here include driven turbulence , rather than the decaying turbulence used in @xcite , with an rms velocity @xmath58 , and an initial vertical magnetic field of @xmath59  @xmath60 g . in table",
    "[ turb_runs ] we give the initial density @xmath56 and metallicity @xmath57 , the box size @xmath61 , the strength of the radiation field @xmath62 in units of @xmath63 , and the number of zones along one edge of the cube @xmath64 .",
    "our models show that the molecular to atomic ratio @xmath0 grows almost as a power law in time over many dynamical times ( figure  [ fig : result ] ) .",
    "although our models will eventually reach saturation , the time taken to do so is generally longer than the plausible lifetimes for molecular clouds of 2030  myr @xcite .",
    "we only find evidence for reaching an equilibrium value of @xmath0 within the first 25  myr of evolution of our models for the model with the least active molecule formation ( the low density and metallicity model n30-z01 discussed in   [ subsec : equilibrium ] ) .",
    "we can derive a simple analytic model for the behavior seen in our simulations by considering the finite formation timescale of molecular hydrogen in a uniform medium .",
    "a rather similar approach is followed by @xcite . the fractional local density of molecular hydrogen @xmath65 where @xmath66 , grows as @xmath67 where the formation rate @xmath68 , and we have included a time dependent clumping factor @xmath69 to account for the density perturbations .",
    "we can eliminate @xmath70 from these two equations to find @xmath71 integrating this equation with a change of variable and the assumption of a uniform value for the clumping factor @xmath69 , we find @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the time constant for @xmath1 formation .",
    "@xcite already showed that for typical molecular cloud temperatures and without clumping ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 the assumption of no clumping should be good for times much less than the dynamical time @xmath76 , when the average density rather than the peak clump density determines the evolution . in our canonical model , @xmath77  myr , while our small box models with suffix l5 have @xmath78  myr .",
    "we can compare this simple model with our numerical results and the observations under the assumption that the local density ratio @xmath79 can be used to derive the column density ratio @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig : result ] shows that , as expected , this analytic model works well at early times , up to roughly 0.4  myr for the canonical model , and 0.1  myr for our small box models . in both cases ,",
    "this represents a clumping time @xmath81 thereafter , @xmath0 increases above the prediction of the simplest model , because of the enhanced clumping caused by the turbulence @xcite .",
    "the assumption of an equilibrium fraction of molecular hydrogen fails , not just because of the long formation timescale of molecular hydrogen but also because molecular hydrogen does not form uniformly .",
    "supersonic turbulence in the cold , neutral , atomic medium produces strong , transient , density perturbations .",
    "peak densities exceed the average value by the square of the local thermal mach number , which for conditions in the cold neutral medium can be a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "since the formation timescale ( eq .  [ eq : analytic ] ) is inversely proportional to density , formation proceeds far more quickly in the density peaks .",
    "because of the strong self - shielding of @xmath1 , it does not immediately photodissociate when it subsequently advects into lower density regions , leading to non - equilibrium fractions in lower density regions @xcite .",
    "no constant value of the clumping factor fits the late time results , however .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath83 used in figure  [ fig : result ] fits the @xmath84 results well at late time , but overpredicts the canonical @xmath85 result substantially , though it does match the small box model well at late times .",
    "the time and density dependent variation of the clumping factor has begun to be studied by @xcite .",
    "we compare a selection of our time - dependent results for turbulent gas to the equilibrium values derived for spherical clouds by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : kmt ] we compare time histories of a representative set of our models to the approximate equilibrium values of @xmath0 for the conditions of each of these models given by equation  ( [ eq : kmt ] ) , taking @xmath42 to be the column density through the cubical simulation domain , and @xmath86 the equilibrium approximation works particularly poorly at @xmath87 , predicting no molecules in many cases where we find measurable molecular fractions . at larger values of @xmath0 , our models do intersect the spherical , equilibrium values , but at widely varied times , and with no indication of asymptotic approach to those values .",
    "the equilibrium models predict strong variation depending on the ambient radiation field , while we see little to no effect ( comparing the g0 and g10 models to the canonical models , we see that they are practically identical in the n300 case ) .",
    "this is because the evolution is controlled by @xmath1 formation rather than photodissociation equilibrium .",
    "this occurs because the supersonic turbulent flows have strong density enhancements , leading both to efficient self - shielding in the regions where most @xmath1 is forming and also fast local molecule growth in those enhancements .",
    "we do note that the equilibrium models in the intermediate regime give the qualitatively correct result of @xmath1 formation at moderate densities .",
    "although this is neither quantitatively corrrect nor extendible to other regimes , it nevertheless means that observational comparisons that rely only on this qualitative result can be successfully made to the equilibrium models .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in our models depends on the metallicity , through its regulation of the dust density , and thus the @xmath1 formation rate .",
    "however , only our very lowest density and metallicity model n30-z01 approaches an equilibrium value during the 20  myr that we ran our models .",
    "this suggests that real molecular clouds rarely find themselves in equilibrium with the diffuse radiation field because their lifetimes are not long enough @xcite .",
    "instead , they are probably dissociated and dispersed by intense , local , uv radiation from newly formed stars .",
    "averaged over kiloparsec scales , the average temperature , magnetic pressure , and turbulent velocity dispersion of the cold , neutral medium vary little , with @xmath8870k @xcite , field strength @xmath89",
    "g @xcite or perhaps 20% higher as seen in observations of external galaxies @xcite , and turbulent mach number @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that this roughly constant effective dynamical temperature comes from self - regulation of star formation .",
    "the roughly constant dynamical temperature suggests that the apparent dependence of the fraction @xmath0 on pressure @xmath5 given in equation  ( [ eq : press ] ) may actually reflect a density dependence , as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : result ] indeed shows a clear density dependence , but it also shows strong time dependence , raising the question of what molecular fraction should actually be compared with the observations . if the hypothesis holds that molecular clouds actually form during large - scale gravitational instability as discussed in",
    "  [ intro ] , then the characteristic time in their lives at which clouds will be observed is a free - fall time ( eq .  [ eq : tff ] ) after gravitational collapse begins in cooled atomic gas .",
    "our models do not begin with clumped atomic gas as the actual ism does",
    ". instead , the turbulent flows initialized on the grid clump the gas over a finite time @xmath91 ( eq .  [ eq : deltatc ] ) . in order to account for this effect",
    ", we have taken the zero point in time for this comparison to be @xmath91 rather than the initial time of our models .",
    "we emphasize that the observations show an order of magnitude scatter around the average @xmath0@xmath5 correlation , so that using a characteristic time to describe a time - dependent process appears likely to be consistent with the observations if they catch clouds at different points in their evolution centered around a free - fall time .",
    "each of our models has a fixed average density @xmath24 given in table  [ turb_runs ] .",
    "we use that value to compute the average pressure in our models @xmath92 where we assume that @xmath93  k , and the mean mass per particle @xmath94 appropriate for atomic gas with 10% helium by number . because our models are subject to dynamo generation of magnetic field from the initial value , we use the actual values of the average magnetic pressure at each time rather than the initial value .",
    "we then use equation  ( [ eq : press ] ) to derive the value and standard deviation of @xmath0 predicted by @xcite for the pressure for that model by setting @xmath95 .",
    "we also derive values of @xmath0 from the spiral and dwarf samples of @xcite .",
    "the spiral sample has @xmath96 , while the dwarf sample has @xmath97 .",
    "all of these values are plotted in figure  [ fig : h2frac ] at times @xmath98 after the beginning of evolution of our models .",
    "we find that our models predict the observed @xmath0 across more than an order of magnitude in pressure , with an accuracy better than the scatter in the observationally derived relations themselves . the ability to predict not just a single value , but a whole family of values accurately suggests that we have captured the important physics of the variation of the molecular fraction @xmath0 with the estimated midplane pressure .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2frac ] shows that the values of @xmath0 we find in our @xmath99 simulations are systematically higher at late times than those found in our @xmath100 simulations .",
    "( this is in addition to the early time differences discussed above that occur because of the difference in crossing time @xmath101 between the two box sizes . ) since both sets of runs were performed with the same numerical resolution of @xmath102 zones per side , the spatial resolution of our l5 runs is four times larger than that in our other runs .",
    "this prompts the concern that our simulations may be under - resolved , and that our reported results for @xmath0 might have a significant dependence on the spatial resolution of the simulations .    to investigate this ,",
    "we have performed several additional simulations with a higher numerical resolution . in figure",
    "[ fig : resn1](a ) , we compare the evolution of @xmath0 in two canonical runs and the corresponding l5 runs , with that in two runs performed using the same sets of simulation parameters , but with twice the numerical resolution .",
    "increasing the resolution to @xmath103 zones per side leads to slightly faster production of h@xmath104 at late times , particularly in the lower density runs , since we are better able to resolve the highest density structures produced by the turbulence .",
    "however , the effect is small , and does not explain the significantly larger difference that we see between the results of the 5  pc ( l5 ) and 20  pc runs .",
    "ideally , we would perform a similar comparison using results from runs with @xmath100 and a numerical resolution of @xmath105 zones , which would have the same spatial resolution as our @xmath106 runs .",
    "unfortunately , the high computational cost of performing a @xmath105 simulation using the full @xcite cooling and chemistry model has so far rendered this impractical .",
    "however , it has been possible to perform simulations with this resolution by adopting a simpler treatment of the co chemistry based on @xcite . by using this simpler treatment ,",
    "we accept a slightly higher degree of error in our predicted co , c and c@xmath50 abundances , and lose our ability to follow the evolution of chemical species such as oh or water , but still retain the ability to follow the evolution of the @xmath1 abundance accurately , since our treatment of the hydrogen chemistry remains the same . at these densities ,",
    "the change in cooling from the modified chemistry will produce negligible changes in the chemical evolution .",
    "we show the results of this full resolution study in figure  [ fig : resn1](b ) .",
    "once again , we see that although our results remain somewhat sensitive to the numerical resolution of the simulation , the effect is relatively small and can not be responsible for the difference between the @xmath107 and @xmath100 runs .",
    "if spatial resolution is not the answer , then what is responsible for the difference between the runs with different box sizes at late times ?",
    "the lower visual extinction of the gas in the smaller box allows stronger photoelectric heating , which leads to the gas in the l5 runs having a systematically higher temperature than the gas in the larger volume simulations .",
    "for example , the volume weighted mean temperature of the gas at the end of run n300 is approximately 40  k , while in run n300-l5 it is 66  k. this difference in temperatures leads to a systematic difference in the h@xmath104 formation rate coefficient , owing to the @xmath108 temperature dependence of the rate coefficient , and hence leads to a faster production of h@xmath104 in the smaller volume simulations .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the limitations of this work .",
    "the biggest problem is that we are substituting a study of local isotropic turbulent regions without explicit self - gravity for one of the dynamical interstellar medium .",
    "however , to reach the resolutions of less than 0.2 pc used here in any large - scale model of the interstellar medium remains computationally challenging .",
    "these resolutions are required in order to resolve the turbulent density peaks that determine the @xmath1 formation rate .",
    "we approximate the external field of fuv dissociating radiation by injecting radiation at the boundaries of our periodic box .",
    "although this is physically inconsistent , we find that in this study it makes virtually no difference , as models with and without fuv behave almost identically .",
    "this is because the densities that we study are sufficiently high that @xmath1 self - shielding efficiently blocks penetration of uv into the dense regions where @xmath1 forms and remains .",
    "this also means that the opening of voids in the density distribution by the turbulence has much less effect on the @xmath1 fraction than the creation of density peaks .    in our models ,",
    "we do not include local sources of dissociating or ionizing radiation .",
    "star formation of course produces such local sources , which can be effective at dispersing molecular clouds on short time scales .",
    "turbulent models of such dispersal have not yet been performed , but analytic models assuming spherical symmetry by @xcite and @xcite show that large clouds can be dispersed in a dynamical time . similarly , analytic models including accretion show lifetimes comparable to the observed values of around 20  myr @xcite in either a slab converging flow @xcite or a spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "these relatively short cloud destruction time scales support our assumption that most clouds are observed at an age of roughly a free - fall time .",
    "our chemical model has been simplified to allow computation on a three - dimensional grid . however , in the range of temperatures and densities considered here , @xcite have shown that we reproduce the results of the umist model to within a few tens of percent .",
    "moreover , we do not expect any of the chemical processes omitted from the model to have a significant impact on the fractional abundance of molecular hydrogen , and hence our values for @xmath0 should be quite accurate .",
    "finally , we assume in this study that the dominant contributions to the observed column densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen come from cold , dense clouds , rather than from the warm , diffuse medium surrounding these clouds .",
    "this is good to better than a factor of two in the milky way where cold gas represents roughly @xmath109 while warm atomic and ionized gas is a bit less than @xmath110 @xcite , and is probably better in more massive disks , but will break down in outer disks or other regions where the wnm component dominates the mass budget .",
    "since in practice @xmath0 is only measured in regions where co emission can be detected , our approximation should be reasonable in the regime where observations are available .",
    "@xcite tested the equilibrium models of @xcite ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : kmt ] ) against relatively low - resolution ( smallest zone size @xmath111  pc ) global numerical simulations of @xmath1 formation in galaxies .",
    "the simulations were described by @xcite , and used the @xmath1 formation law of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found good agreement in cases where we find that our models reach high molecular fractions quickly ( those with high density and low radiation intensity ) , but poor agreement in cases where we find that time - dependence matters .",
    "the formation law of @xcite effectively reproduces the simple model that we have described in equation  ( [ eq : analytic ] ) .",
    "the inability of global models to resolve the density peaks is captured in the higher value of the clumping factor they require to reproduce observations . because lower mean densities are deduced , these models do still overestimate the sensitivity of molecule formation to radiation .",
    "@xcite compared the equilibrium model given by equation  ( [ eq : kmt ] ) to local ( 100  pc beam size ) observations of the column density of and global ( 1  kpc beam size ) observations of co and .",
    "they demonstrate that the equilibrium model with freely adjusted clumping factor predicts high molecular fractions in regions of high local density , as we also predict without such an adjustable factor , and that there is a metallicity dependence , again as we also predict .",
    "we have demonstrated that the molecular fraction @xmath0 remains strongly time dependent over periods of rather more than 20  myr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ) .",
    "our high - resolution numerical results provide calibration for the time - dependent molecule formation model of @xcite which assumes similar physics , but must rely on much larger clumping factors to reproduce sub - grid scale turbulence .",
    "equilibrium values of @xmath0 are only reached at times well beyond the lifetimes of real molecular clouds of 2030  myr @xcite .",
    "therefore , explanations of the observed correlation between midplane pressure and @xmath0 that rely on equilibrium values seem unlikely to be correct .",
    "we find that the observed correlation can nevertheless be explained if most molecular gas occurs in regions that have been forming @xmath1 for a free - fall time at their current number density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h2frac ] ) .",
    "this is a natural prediction for the gravitational instability model for star formation in galaxies .",
    "molecular cloud formation occurs as part of the same process of large scale collapse that eventually forms stars , so the observed correlation between molecular hydrogen and star formation rate surface densities comes about because they have a common cause , not because the first controls the second .",
    "our result appears almost independent of the strength of the far ultraviolet dissociating radiation field during formation of the molecular clouds , as can be seen by the close agreement of our canonical models with otherwise identical models run without or with stronger dissociating radiation . in future work the upper limits of this behavior",
    "must be examined , since clearly a strong enough radiation field will eventually dissociate molecular gas , or at least ionize enough of it to dynamically disperse it , allowing dissociation to occur . in particular ,",
    "once massive star formation begins , the intense local radiation field probably does dissociate or disperse the remaining molecular hydrogen , terminating molecule formation relatively quickly and determining the cloud lifetime .",
    "the metallicity clearly influences the molecular hydrogen formation rate in our models , through its regulation of the dust density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kmt ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1 formation rate depends on the product @xmath112 of the number density and the metallicity @xcite because of the role of dust grains in the formation reaction , so this is expected .",
    "however , we find a weaker sensitivity than suggested by equation  ( [ eq : kmt ] ) derived from an equilibrium model .",
    "detailed comparison of our results to galaxies with varying metallicity should prove informative .",

    "<S> observations of spiral galaxies show a strong linear correlation between the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen surface density @xmath0 and midplane pressure . </S>",
    "<S> to explain this , we simulate three - dimensional , magnetized turbulence , including simplified treatments of non - equilibrium chemistry and the propagation of dissociating radiation , to follow the formation of @xmath1 from cold atomic gas . the formation time scale for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is sufficiently long that equilibrium is not reached within the 2030  myr lifetimes of molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium balance between radiative dissociation and @xmath1 formation on dust grains fails to predict the time - dependent molecular fractions we find . </S>",
    "<S> a simple , time - dependent model of @xmath1 formation can reproduce the gross behavior , although turbulent density perturbations increase molecular fractions by a factor of few above it . in contradiction to equilibrium models , </S>",
    "<S> radiative dissociation of molecules plays little role in our model for diffuse radiation fields with strengths less than ten times that of the solar neighborhood , because of the effective self - shielding of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed correlation of @xmath0 with pressure corresponds to a correlation with local gas density if the effective temperature in the cold neutral medium of galactic disks is roughly constant . </S>",
    "<S> we indeed find such a correlation of @xmath0 with density . </S>",
    "<S> if we examine the value of @xmath0 in our local models after a free - fall time at their average density , as expected for models of molecular cloud formation by large - scale gravitational instability , our models reproduce the observed correlation over more than an order of magnitude range in density . </S>"
