    "the first evidence for the pentaquark hadron @xmath7 , discovered by the leps collaboration at spring-8 @xcite , was subsequently confirmed in some other experiments @xcite . however , many other experiments failed to find the @xmath7 signal ( for surveys see  @xcite ) .",
    "most of them came from the data analysis of high - statistics high - energy experiments .",
    "these null results at high energies were not so much surprising because it is natural to expect a sizable suppression in the production of the more complicated five - quark system compared to the conventional three - quark hyperons @xcite .",
    "but the state of affairs became dramatic after the recent publication of the high statistics results of the clas collaboration @xcite .",
    "the first experiment is designed to search for the @xmath0 signal in @xmath9 in direct @xmath10 interactions at relatively low photon energy , @xmath11  gev .",
    "the second one aimed to search for the @xmath0 signal in @xmath12 and @xmath13 reactions . within the experimental significance , no @xmath0 signal was observed .",
    "note however , that recently the diana collaboration confirmed a former result for @xmath0 production in @xmath14 interaction with xe nuclei @xcite .",
    "another positive , but low statistics result on @xmath0 production in @xmath15 interaction was obtained in kek  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the situation concerning the existence of the pentaquark state remains controversial .",
    "coming back to the high statistics clas experiments , one can conclude that if the @xmath0 exists , then the null result means that we do not understand the mechanism of @xmath0 photoproduction in elementary @xmath16 reactions .",
    "indeed , in all theoretical studies ( for references , see the recent review paper @xcite ) the cross section of this reaction is defined by the @xmath17 and @xmath18 exchange dynamics . in the first case ,",
    "the amplitudes are proportional to the product of the @xmath0-nucleon - kaon coupling constant @xmath19 and the form factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the four momenta of the baryon ( nucleon or @xmath0 ) and the kaon , respectively .",
    "one of the hadrons is far off - shell .",
    "if one uses the @xmath22 decay width ( @xmath23 ) as an input parameter , then the @xmath19 coupling is fixed , but unfortunately , there are no guiding rules for the off - shell form factors which bring some ambiguity into the theoretical predictions . for @xmath18 exchange",
    "processes the situation is even worse . in this case",
    "we do not know the @xmath24 coupling constant ( the ambiguity of its estimate is rather large @xcite ) and the `` off - shellness '' in the @xmath0- nucleon-@xmath18 vertex is much greater because of the large mass difference between @xmath18 and @xmath17 mesons .",
    "the clas null result for a finite @xmath0 decay width means large off - shell suppression of the corresponding amplitudes and small @xmath24 coupling constant .",
    "therefore , the best way to check whether the @xmath0 exists or not is to study the @xmath1 fusion reaction with a quasi - free kaon and a nucleon in the initial state . in this case",
    "the @xmath19 coupling is fixed ( for given @xmath23 ) , and there is no ambiguity with the off - shell form factor because all hadrons are on the mass shell .",
    "this situation may be realized in the reaction @xmath25 ( @xmath6 ) with the @xmath0 showing up as a peak in the @xmath26 invariant mass distribution as shown in ref .",
    "there are several conditions which can enhance this effect .",
    "first , the @xmath4 invariant mass must be close to the mass of @xmath5 . in this case , the total amplitude is the coherent sum of two amplitudes with charged and neutral kaon exchange shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "tree level diagrams for the reaction @xmath27 .",
    "the exchange of charged and neutral kaons is shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . ]",
    "the dominance of the @xmath18 meson exchange in @xmath5 photoproduction @xcite results in a constructive interference between the two amplitudes which enhances the @xmath0 signal .",
    "second , the deuteron wave function greatly suppresses the processes with a fast moving recoil nucleon , therefore , the experiment must be able to measure an extremely slowly moving recoil ( spectator ) nucleon which participates in the @xmath28 reaction . and third",
    ", the @xmath4 pair must be knocked out in the forward direction . in this case , the momentum of the recoil kaon is small , and it can merge with the slowly moving spectator nucleon to produce a @xmath0 .",
    "the clas experiment  @xcite to search for @xmath0 was designed to study the direct @xmath29 reaction and , in principle , it does not satisfy the above conditions .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 and the outgoing neutron have finite momenta , and , therefore , the experiment has a neutron momentum cut of @xmath30  gev / c . in order to reduce the contribution of @xmath31 mesons coming from @xmath5 excitation the data analysis makes a cut on the @xmath5 mass , i.e. the @xmath4 invariant mass is outside the @xmath5 mass .",
    "it has cuts for the kaon momenta , @xmath32  ( gev / c ) , and cuts for the angles for positive and negative particles , @xmath33 and @xmath34 degrees , respectively .",
    "all these experimental conditions ( the @xmath4invariant mass , momenta and the angle cuts ) while being quite acceptable for studying the @xmath35 reaction result in a large suppression of the @xmath36 formation process in the @xmath9 reaction and reduce the ratio of @xmath0 resonance contribution ( signal ) to background ( noise ) - s / n .    in order to avoid the obvious difficulty in measuring the slowly moving recoil nucleon one has to analyze the @xmath8 $ ] missing mass distribution  @xcite . in this case , all momenta , allowed by the conservation laws participate in the process and , of course , the dominant contribution would come from slowly moving nucleons . as a result ,",
    "the total cross section strongly increases .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the background processes increase roughly by a factor of two compared to the exclusive @xmath9 reaction , because both the @xmath26 and @xmath37 final states now contribute . nevertheless , even under this circumstance such experimental conditions can give a better chance to see the @xmath0 signal , in case it exists .",

    "[ fig:6 ] we show the differential cross section at @xmath1182.1 and 3.8 gev together with available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "one can see that for increasing initial photon energy the cross section decreases at backward angles for the @xmath17 photoproduction .",
    "therefore , we expect that the threshold region with @xmath119  gev is most favorable for studying associated @xmath91 photoproduction which reflects the @xmath0 formation .",
    "note that a similar approach for the @xmath120 photoproduction based on the effective lagrangian formalism was recently developed by nam , hosaka , and kim @xcite .",
    "the difference to our approach consists in ( i ) a different choice of the form factors and ( ii ) a different @xmath121 coupling constant , which results in an enhancement of the born terms . in this case one",

    "@xcite together with the available experimental data .",
    "one can see that the description of this reaction is quite reasonable .",
    "next , the coupling constant of @xmath131 can be extracted from the @xmath132 decay , and the @xmath133 and @xmath134 couplings can be found from su(3 ) symmetry relations .",
    "then , the contribution to @xmath135 photoproduction from the virtual vector meson excitation may be easily evaluated .",
    "but at this moment , we have to make two comments .",
    "first , in the @xmath124 reaction the virtual vector mesons are off mass shell and , therefore , one has to introduce the corresponding form factors @xcite .",
    "the form factors , together with the vector meson propagators , strongly suppress contributions of the virtual @xmath136 and @xmath137 mesons leaving only a noticeable contribution from the @xmath129 meson which is almost on - shell because of the small decay width of the @xmath129 meson .",
    "second , in the data analysis for @xmath0 photoproduction the contribution of the @xmath129 meson can be excluded by making a corresponding `` @xmath129-meson cut '' @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss it here in order to fix other sources of @xmath135 photoproduction , having in hand only the total cross section @xmath138 of the @xmath139 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the situation with the contribution from the @xmath127 is not so transparent . at @xmath140  gev",
    ", there is some difference ( @xmath141 ) on the level of @xmath142% between the total cross section @xmath138 and the total contribution from @xmath5 and vector meson excitations .",
    "this difference increases at higher energies , because @xmath138 increases with energy , whereas the contribution from @xmath5 decreases with energy and the contribution from the @xmath129 mesons stays constant . at low energies ,",
    "@xmath141 may be identified with the virtual excitation and decay of hyperons other than @xmath5 .",
    "thus for example , oh , nakayama , and lee considered contributions from @xmath143 , and @xmath144  @xcite , roberts included additionally contributions from @xmath145 and @xmath146  @xcite . in principle",
    ", one can also add contributions from @xmath147 and @xmath148 hyperons , listed in pdg  @xcite .",
    "another source of @xmath88 pair photoproduction in @xmath89 reaction is the so - called drell process @xcite where the incoming photon virtually decays into a @xmath135 pair with subsequent quasi - elastic or charge - exchange @xmath149 re - scattering .",

    "experimental data from ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "it is quite clear that a consistent description of all the listed background sources is well beyond the present state - of - the - art because one needs a fairly large number of poorly known strength parameters , form factors , phases etc .",
    "moreover , we need a proper description of the high energy behavior of these processes . on the other hand , in case of a large number of background sources we can assume random relative phases between them which leads to cancellations of the interference terms . also , as a first approximation one can choose the incoherent sum of the squares of the amplitudes to be a constant .",
    "this means that the energy dependence at low energies of this source of @xmath135 pairs is defined essentially by the phase space factor .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath5 photoproduction shows that this approximation works well ( see the solid and long dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] at low energy ) . the value of the constant matrix element can be obtained from a comparison with experimental data for the @xmath154 reaction . in our further analysis",
    "we parameterize the amplitude of the additional contribution @xmath141 ( for the sake of a concise notation , we denote it as @xmath153 ) by the constant matrix element with @xmath155  gev@xmath156 .",
    "this parameterization , being quite reasonable at low energy with @xmath157  gev , results in a somewhat larger rise of the cross section and overestimates the data by @xmath158 at @xmath159  gev .",
