    "environment - induced decoherence is a vexed issue in confronting the challenges to quantum information processes .",
    "simple model calculations thus assume significance , to grasp the underlying parameter - regimes that can be manipulated , in order to minimize the effect of the environment . in quantum optics and solid state physics ,",
    "the device that has gained popularity in recent times is a qubit ( which can be approximately represented by a pair of two quantum dots)@xmath0 .",
    "this system is equivalent to a superconducting josephson junction@xmath1 or a spin-1/2 nmr nucleus@xmath2 .",
    "a qubit can be described by a two - level hamiltonian , the quantum mechanics of which is rather straightforward .",
    "environmental influences can also be easily incorporated in this hamiltonian .",
    "there have been two distinctive attempts in modeling the environment , either in terms of ( @xmath3 ) a classical stochastic process , such as a gaussian or a telegraph one , or ( @xmath4 ) an explicit quantum collection of bosonic oscillators .",
    "one of the main objectives in this paper is to seek a unification of these two apparently disparate approaches .",
    "we consider an electron hopping between two single level quantum dots , coupled via a tunneling coefficient @xmath5 and an asymmetric bias @xmath6 . denoting by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the left and right dot states , the qubit hamiltonian , indicated by the subscript @xmath9 ,",

    "our strategy is to expand the hilbert space to re - express the system hamiltonian as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is yet another pauli matrix , which could represent a spin-1/2 impurity , for instance .",
    "the idea is to couple the @xmath18-system to a bath of bosonic oscillators , thereby causing fluctuations in @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting full hamiltonian can be written as @xmath19 here @xmath20(@xmath21 ) are boson creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath22 are coupling constants and @xmath23 is the harmonic oscillator frequency of the @xmath24 mode .",
    "it is interesting to physically assess the effect of the coupling term ( proportional to @xmath25 ) on the system hamiltonian @xmath26 . because @xmath27 is purely off - diagonal in the @xmath18- representation",
    ", it would cause spin - flips in @xmath18 between two allowed values + 1 and -1 , as in the celebrated glauber model of ising kinetics@xmath28 .",
    "these flips would occur with an amplitude field that would be proportional to @xmath25 and time - varying bosonic operators @xmath29 , in the interaction representation of the last term in eq .",
    "the net effect on @xmath26 is a quantum noise , encapsulated by @xmath30 . in a suitable limit ,",
    "when the latter , i.e. @xmath30 , could be replaced by a classical noise @xmath31 that jumps at random between @xmath32 , the system hamiltonian would be stochastic , given by , @xmath33 where @xmath31 is a two - state jump process or a telegraph process . while we will present below a fully quantum mechanical treatment of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , our aim will also be to set conditions under which a classical stochastic description via a telegraph process of @xmath31 , as expounded in detail by tokura and itakura@xmath34 , would ensue from the quantum formulation .",

    "( 5 ) falls under the general scheme of a system - plus - bath approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , in which the full hamiltonian is written as , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the interaction hamiltonian and @xmath37 is the bath hamiltonian . in the present instance , @xmath38 as we will be employing a liouvillean approach to the dynamics governed by @xmath39 , it is useful to explain the notation .",

    "they have also considered the additional influence of external time - varying fields for controlling decoherence , dynamically .",
    "while we will be employing a very similar approach , our treatment will differ from gordon etal@xmath47 .",
    "the latter utilize the born approximation , valid for weak coupling constants @xmath25 , whereas we will consider strong coupling in which @xmath25 will be treated to all orders .",
    "such strong coupling considerations are the hallmark of functional integral treatments of quantum dissipative systems eg . that of a spin - boson hamiltonian@xmath48",
    ". furthermore our focus in the classical limit of the quantum noise will be a telegraph process as opposed to the much - studied gaussian stochastic processes .",

    "in order to incorporate strong - coupling effects it is convenient to transform the hamiltonian @xmath39 in eq .

    "we emphasize once more that though the self - energy is computed to second order in @xmath84 , the theory is valid to arbitrary orders in the original coupling constants @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the resultant master equation in the time domain that emanates from eq .",
    "( 24 ) is of more general validity than the one obtained in the born - approximation@xmath47 .",
    "our next step is to write the matrix elements of the self - energy @xmath87 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath87 is a liouvillean in the @xmath89-subspace alone because the @xmath54 and the bath variables are averaged over , in eq .",

    "thus , for all frequencies greater than the cut - off @xmath110 , quantum fluctuations remain strictly coherent . before we take up the comparison with the telegraph noise it is pertinent to point out that it is meaningful to think of a quantum bath as classical only in the incoherent regime i.e. over time scales larger than @xmath118 .",
    "in other words , the classical limit of the bath obtains for frequencies @xmath119 , i.e. the temperature is significantly large , but not so large as to violate the condition @xmath120 , if we want to restrict our discussion within the domain of validity of the analytical result of eq .",

    "the markovian assumption is invoked , to begin with , as seen in eq .",
    "( a.2 ) below .",
    "the second crucial ingredient in the quantum situation , even after the markovian approximation is incorporated , is in the temperature - dependence of the relaxation rate @xmath123 .",

    "thus the comparison with the classical telegraph process is meaningful only if one takes the markovian limit of heat bath induced relaxation , at the outset .    at sufficiently high temperatures given by @xmath164 we can see from eq .",

    "also , as it is obvious from the expression of the relaxation rate that the dependence on temperature is not an exponential , rather it shows a power law behavior .",
    "however , it is pertinent to emphasize that these conclusions hinge on our assumption that quantum dissipation is ohmic . in the more general case , discussed below in sec .",
    "iii d , we will see that the temperature - dependence of the relaxation rate can in fact be exponential , under certain special situations .    at low temperatures and",
    "weak damping i.e. small @xmath112 , @xmath133 is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 is a renormalized form of tunneling frequency given by @xmath172 . using this form of @xmath133 , and eq .",

    "( 44 ) , it is evident that the relaxation rate becomes @xmath174 , which is far from an exponential in temperature .",
    "thus it may be stressed that even in the markovian limit the temperature dependence of both the relaxation rate as well as the rabi frequency is much more complex than an exponential , as is usually assumed for classical activated processes .",
    "these conclusions are similar to those obtained earlier in the context of spin relaxation of a muon , tunneling in a double well@xmath175 .",

    "we will try to make a connection with the classical telegraph process and show that in the high - temperature limit , the relaxation rate indeed follows an exponential dependence on temperature with however quantum corrections , which was not the case in the ohmic limit .",

    "thus the dominant behavior of the relaxation rate is an exponential dependence on temperature , which is what we expect at high temperatures .",
    "this analysis therefore provides a regime where we can more meaningfully compare the relaxation rate @xmath123 for the case of classical telegraph process with the laplace transform of the bath correlation function in the quantum case .",
