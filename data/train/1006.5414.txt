    "each of these numbers is the circumference of a `` hole '' in this torus and also half the length of the minimal closed geodesics in the free homotopy classes associated to the standard generators @xmath20 and @xmath21 in @xmath22 .    as there is a long - standing interest in the relationship between the laplace spectrum of a manifold and its length spectrum ( i.e. , the collection of lengths of closed geodesics ) , it is natural to wonder about the mutual influences between the laplace spectrum and the covering spectrum",
    "specifically , one would like to know if the covering spectrum is a spectral invariant . in (",
    "10.5 ) , sormani and wei demonstrated that certain isospectral manifolds arising through sunada s method @xcite share the same covering spectrum , suggesting that the covering spectrum might at least be an invariant of this technique .",
    "however , through an analysis of the group theory and geometry underlying the covering spectrum we constructed sunada - isospectral manifolds with distinct covering spectra in dimensions three and higher ( * ? ? ?",

    "if @xmath23 is a gassmann - sunada triple where @xmath26 acts freely and isometrically on a riemannian manifold @xmath30 , then sunada s theorem ( theorem  [ thm : sunadapesce ] ) tells us that the quotient riemannian manifolds @xmath31 and @xmath32 are isospectral , and the isospectral pairs arising in this manner are said to be _ sunada - isospectral_. sunada s theorem provided the first systematic method for constructing isospectral manifolds and  along with its numerous variants ",
    "accounts for many of the isospectral pairs in the literature ( see @xcite for a retrospective on sunada s method ) . in @xcite",
    "we discovered an analogous algebraic condition and theorem concerning the covering spectrum .",

    "metric on @xmath30 , the quotient riemannian manifolds @xmath31 and @xmath36 share the same covering spectrum .",
    "we then went on to produce examples of gassmann - sunada triples that are not jump triples .",
    "as a consequence we were able to construct sunada - isospectral manifolds with distinct covering spectra in all dimensions greater than or equal to three . however , our method for building such examples appears to fail in dimension two as the arguments underlying theorem  [ thm : dgs ] depend in part on the fact that all free homotopy classes in dimension three and higher can be represented by simple closed curves .    in this article",
    "we take a different approach in order to establish the following theorem showing that the covering spectrum is not a spectral invariant of a surface .",
    "[ thm : main ] for each integer @xmath37 there exist pairs of closed connected sunada - isospectral surfaces of genus @xmath38 with distinct covering spectra .    to prove the result above we construct certain cayley graphs associated to a well - known gassmann - sunada triple ( * ? ? ?",
    "11.4.7 . ) , and endow them with suitably chosen edge lengths so that the resulting length spaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 have distinct covering spectra .",
    "we then build continuous families of riemannian manifolds @xmath41 and @xmath42 that are pairwise sunada - isospectral for each @xmath43 and such that for each @xmath44 the family @xmath45 converges with respect to the gromov - hausdorff metric to @xmath46 as @xmath47 tends to zero .",

    "currently , it is not clear to us whether any of the aforementioned pairs consist of riemann surfaces .",

    "then @xmath58 induces a filtration @xmath59 , where @xmath60 such filtrations will prove to be useful in our discussion of the covering spectrum .",
    "we now observe that given a connected and compact semi - locally simply - connected length space @xmath61 its metric structure induces a natural filtration ( indexed by the positive reals ) on its fundamental group @xmath62 . indeed , for each @xmath63 let @xmath64 be the open cover of @xmath0 consisting of all the open @xmath5-balls in @xmath61 .",

    "the subgroup @xmath65 is normal in @xmath62 and the conjugacy classes of the generators @xmath66 $ ] of @xmath65 represent the free homotopy classes of loops that have representatives completely contained in a @xmath5-ball .",
    "in this fashion we obtain a filtration @xmath72 of @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath61 be a connected and compact semi - locally simply - connected length space .",
    "we then define",
    "the _ covering spectrum _ of @xmath61 to be the set @xmath73    now , since each subgroup @xmath65 of @xmath62 is normal , the galois theory of covering spaces ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5.13 ) tells us that we may associate to each subgroup a connected regular covering space @xmath74 known as the _ @xmath5-cover _ of @xmath0 .",

    "hence , we obtain a tower @xmath78 of regular covers of @xmath0 and the covering spectrum detects when we have a change in the isomorphism type of the cover .",

    "since free homotopy classes correspond to conjugacy classes in @xmath86 we see that @xmath58 is a class function .",

    "* example 4.7 ) .",
    "in particular , this example shows that for a flat @xmath99-torus , the covering spectrum need not be equal to the successive minima of the corresponding lattice @xmath100 in @xmath101 .",
    "we conclude this section by recalling that in proposition  [ prop : newgeo ] we observed that for any compact length space @xmath0 we have @xmath102 , where @xmath103 denotes the length spectrum of @xmath0 .",
    "now , it is well known that the length spectrum does not behave well under gromov - hausdorff convergence : lengths may disappear or suddenly appear in the limit ( cf .",
    "* examples 8.1 - 8.3 ) ) .",
