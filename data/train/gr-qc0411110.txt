    "the relevance of the initial boundary value problem ( ibvp ) for numerical relativity has been pointed out many times since the ground - breaking work of stewart  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the problem is the well - known fact that einstein s equations @xmath0 when interpreted as second - order field equations for the metric components @xmath1 , provide only six evolution equations for the space components @xmath2 whereas the remaining four einstein s equations @xmath3 are just second - order constraints on @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations are then a reduction of the full einstein s system .",
    "notice that this reduction is not uniquely defined , as far as one can add in multiples of the constraints to the original evolution system : this freedom is at the root of the diversity of the proposed evolution formalisms ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the current approach in numerical relativity is to use one of these reductions of einstein s field equations , plus four coordinate conditions , as the main evolution system in order to compute the full set of metric components .",
    "this is the unconstrained , or free evolution  @xcite , approach in which the constraint equations ( [ constraints ] ) are mainly used for monitoring the accuracy of the simulations . as a consequence",
    ", the evolution system has an extended space of solutions which contains , in addition to the true ones , constraint - violating solutions that do not verify the full set of einstein s equations .",
    "this poses the question of which are the requirements in order to get , in the free evolution approach , true einstein s solutions in a consistent and stable way , avoiding any drifting towards extended , constraint - violating solutions  @xcite .",
    "the key point is to analyze the subsidiary system @xmath4 which follows from the contracted bianchi identities and the conservation of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "as it is well known , the subsidiary system ensures that the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) are first integrals of the main evolution system .",
    "but it can also be interpreted as providing evolution equations for the constraints deviations .",
    "of course , the same is true for any variant obtained by combining ( [ subsidiary ] ) with space derivatives of either evolution or constraint equations : this freedom can be easily used in order to get a variant of the subsidiary system ( [ subsidiary ] ) with a strongly hyperbolic  @xcite , even symmetric hyperbolic , principal part : @xmath5 ( normal coordinates ) .    in the case of the pure initial value problem ( ivp ) , the question about the consistency and stability for free - evolution true - einstein s solutions has been given a precise answer in ref .",
    "@xcite :    * consistency : the initial data must verify the constraint equations .",
    "* stability : the principal part of both the main evolution system and the subsidiary system must be strongly hyperbolic .",
    "our former considerations suggest that the strong hyperbolicity requirement on the subsidiary system is always fulfilled in the cases in which the only constraints are the energy - momentum ones ( [ constraints ] ) .    in the case of the ibvp , which is the main subject of this paper ,",
    "a number of developments are currently under way .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main ones :      the original work in ref .",
    "@xcite was focused on the frittelli - reula evolution system  @xcite .",
    "more recently  @xcite , the constraint - preserving boundaries approach has been extended to other symmetric - hyperbolic systems of the kidder - scheel - teukolsky ( kst ) type  @xcite .",
    "the full programme consists in the following steps :    * writing down the subsidiary system ( it can be ( [ subsidiary ] ) or any variant of it ) as a first order evolution system for constraint deviations , with symmetric hyperbolic principal part . * providing algebraic ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions for the incoming modes of the subsidiary system in such a way that the total amount of constraint deviations ( as measured with a suitable energy estimate ) keeps bounded . * interpreting these algebraic boundary conditions of the subsidiary system as differential ( neumann ) boundary conditions for the constraint - related incoming modes of the main evolution system . * completing the resulting subset of boundary conditions by adding suitable conditions for the remaining incoming modes . *",
    "checking the stability of the final set of the main system boundary conditions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the majda - osher theory  @xcite is applied and the uniform kreiss condition  @xcite is obtained as a result .",
    "an alternative approach has been proposed by frittelli and gmez  @xcite . for a better understanding ,",
    "let us start by writing down the constraint equations ( [ constraints ] ) in a covariant form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the normal to the constant - time hypersurfaces .",
    "in local adapted coordinates we have @xmath8 so that the original form ( [ constraints ] ) is recovered .",
    "the absence of second time derivatives in ( [ constraints ] ) can now be rephrased as the absence of second derivatives normal to the spacelike constant - time hypersurfaces .",
    "now let us invoke the general covariance of einstein s theory .",
    "we will realize that the same kind of result must hold for other kind of hypersurfaces , not just the spacelike ones .",
    "we can then start again from the covariant form ( [ covconstraints ] ) but with @xmath7 being now the normal to any timelike hypersurface , like the ones corresponding to the boundaries of our computational domain . in local adapted coordinates",
    ", we could take for instance @xmath9 so that no second derivatives normal to the constant - z hypersurfaces would appear in ( [ covconstraints ] ) .",
    "if the main evolution system is written in first order form , the absence of second order normal derivatives ensures that four combinations of the first - order dynamical fields can be consistently computed at the boundaries without any recourse to outside information .",
    "the fritelli - gmez idea is to use these combinations in order to get consistent boundary conditions for a subset of four incoming modes ( einstein s boundaries ) .",
    "of course , suitable conditions for the remaining incoming modes must also be provided and the stability of the full set must be checked .",
    "still another approach is due to szilgyi , winicour and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "their formulation looks quite different from the preceding ones , so that we will need to rephrase some statements in order to point out the underlying similarities .",
    "for instance , instead of the reduction of einstein s equations , we will consider the equivalent extension of the solution space . in the harmonic coordinates approach , this extension is achieved by writing down the principal part of einstein s equations as a set of generalized wave equations with some extra terms ( de donder - fock decomposition  @xcite ) and then getting rid of these extra terms by requiring the four spacetime coordinates to be harmonic functions , that is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is considered as a set of four scalar functions here ) .",
    "let us compare now the harmonic coordinates approach with the preceding ones :    * the resulting ( relaxed ) system is used as the main evolution system for the full set of metric components . by construction ,",
    "its principal part amounts to a set of wave equations , so that symmetric hyperbolicity is ensured .",
    "* true einstein s solutions are recovered only when imposing the coordinate conditions ( [ 4harmonic ] ) , which play here the role of the constraints .",
    "the extra principal terms that were suppressed from the original einstein s system contained first derivatives of these coordinate constraints ( second derivatives of the metric components )  @xcite .",
    "* the subsidiary system can be again obtained from ( [ subsidiary ] ) .",
    "terms containing the main evolution system equations , or their derivatives , vanish separately so that only the contribution of the extra principal terms remains .",
    "notice that the resulting subsidiary system is of second order in the coordinate constraints ( [ 4harmonic ] ) , in contrast with the former approaches .",
    "* the principal part of the ( second order ) subsidiary system is symmetric hyperbolic : it amounts again to a set of wave equations on the coordinate constraints ( [ 4harmonic ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a boundary condition derived from the local reflection symmetry requirement is analyzed .",
    "constraint preservation is explicitly shown and a theorem of secchi  @xcite is used in order to show that the resulting ibvp is well posed . this theoretical result is checked by means of the numerical robust - stability test  @xcite , which is adapted so that reflection boundary conditions are applied along just one space axis , while keeping periodic boundary conditions along the other two .",
    "due to the limited use of reflection symmetry boundary conditions in practical applications , a proposal is made  @xcite for extending these results to boundary conditions of the sommerfeld type , as it was done previously in a different framework  @xcite .",
    "the z4 approach  @xcite uses an extra dynamical four - vector , along the track of previous formulations which contained extra dynamical quantities  @xcite .",
    "it has strong similarities with the harmonic coordinates approach , while providing much more flexibility regarding the gauge choices .    *",
    "the main evolution system is obtained by modifying einstein s equations with the help of the extra four - vector @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 this system provides ten evolution equations for the set formed by the six space components of the metric plus the four @xmath12 components .",
    "a first order version can be easily obtained which , when supplemented with suitable gauge conditions , has been shown to have a strongly hyperbolic principal part  @xcite . *",
    "true einstein s solutions can be recovered by requiring the vanishing of the extra four - vector @xmath14 so that this condition can be considered as a set of four algebraic constraints .",
    "notice that the main evolution system ( [ einsteinz4 ] ) is of a mixed type : it contains second order derivatives of the metric , but only first order derivatives of the extra four - vector .",
    "* the subsidiary system can be obtained from the covariant divergence of the main system ( [ einsteinz4 ] ) : it will be of third order in the metric and of second order on the constraint variables @xmath15 .",
    "allowing for ( [ subsidiary ] ) , the einstein s tensor contribution vanishes separately , so that only the contribution of the extra terms remains , namely @xmath16~ = 0~,\\ ] ] which can be also expressed in the equivalent form  @xcite @xmath17 * it follows from ( [ wavezis0 ] ) that the subsidiary system , when considered as a second order system for the algebraic constraints deviations @xmath15 , has a symmetric hyperbolic principal part : it amounts here again to an uncoupled set of wave equations .",
    "the fact that the subsidiary system is of second order means that the vanishing of both @xmath15 and its first time derivative must be imposed on the initial data if one wants to ensure _ a priori _ that the resulting solution will be a true einstein",
    "this amounts to impose the usual energy and momentum constraints ( [ constraints ] ) on the initial data hypersurface , so that it can seem that the z4 formalism is not being of much help .",
    "but on the other side , if one is checking a given solution _ a posteriori _ , the vanishing of @xmath18 in a given spacetime domain ensures that the same is true for its derivatives , so that this solution is necessarily a true einstein s one .",
    "this is why one can monitor constraint violations by looking just at the values of @xmath15 and , more important , this is why one can devise constraint - preserving strategies by aiming at the vanishing of @xmath15 . here",
    "is where the z4 formalism shows its main advantages .    in what follows",
    ", we will consider the fully first - order version of the z4 system  @xcite , as summarized in section 2 .",
    "in section 3 , we will apply the constraint - preserving boundary conditions programme , obtaining as a result conditions of the sommerfeld type for the main evolution system .",
    "the stability of these conditions is studied in section 4 , including the use of the robust - stability numerical test . as a result , our sommerfeld - like conditions",
    "will be shown to behave in the same way as the reflection symmetry ones proposed in refs .",

    "one can wonder about wether the multi - dimensional character of the problem is lost when applying boundary conditions to just one face .",

    "the main problem at corner points comes from the inconsistency inherent to the choice of a ( unique ) normal direction there .",
    "different faces get different normal vectors , but corner points belong to two different faces at the same time .",
    "this is not just a theoretical caveat : corners and edges pose a real problem in practical applications , where more work should be done along any of the following lines :    * devising an specific treatment for corner points .",
    "the correct implementation of constraint - preserving boundary conditions in the presence of corners is still a unsolved issue . for symmetric hyperbolic evolution systems , using finite difference operators satisfying the summation by parts rule with respect to a diagonal scalar product leads to stable schemes with maximally dissipative boundary conditions  @xcite . in our case , with a strongly hyperbolic evolution system",
    ", we have got the same result , as presented in appendix b. + but these results do not extend to constraint - preserving boundary conditions .",
    "a major difficulty is that compatibility conditions between boundary data at adjacent faces need to be satisfied if one wishes to obtain smooth solutions .",
    "necessary conditions for continuous solutions have been derived in ref .",
