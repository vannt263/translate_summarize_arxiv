    "one key unsolved issue in solar physics is the generation and effects of electric currents from photospheric motions of the stressed and sheared coronal magnetic field .",
    "with the development of reliable techniques such as coronal magnetic - field extrapolations based on complex distributions of photospheric currents ( see _ e.g. _ , reviews by @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , it is important to understand how a modelled magnetic - field configuration is subject to change due to slight modifications of the photospheric - current distribution and thus the difference between several force - free assumptions using the same boundary conditions .",
    "the main aim is to understand these changes in the geometry and topology of field lines assuming that the magnetic field is in a force - free equilibrium . in ,",
    "we have performed a first comparison between four different active regions with different behaviours due to the complex distribution of the photospheric field and of the electric currents representing the history of the evolution of the active region .",
    "this comparison was done for the same force - free model , namely the nonlinear force - free field .",
    "we showed that , statistically speaking , the magnetic - field lines are longer and higher in a nonlinear force - free field compared to the corresponding potential field . to develop our understanding of the effects of electric currents on magnetic configurations , compared the behaviour of a simple bipolar field subject to different distributions of electric currents using different force - free models .",
    "the bipolar field has been studied in terms of magnetic - energy storage and magnetic - helicity changes .",
    "we showed that the amount of electric currents that can be injected in a magnetic - equilibrium configuration depends strongly on the spatial distribution of the currents , the existence of return currents having a stabilising effect on the magnetic configuration .",
    "the next step developed in this article is to understand the effects of electric currents on a magnetic configuration having predominant topological elements ( _ i.e. _ a null point in the domain of interest ) .    in the past decades",
    ", magnetic topology has become a key ingredient in understanding the origin of flares in active regions .    the general definition of magnetic topology concerns the properties of magnetic - field lines and magnetic - flux surfaces that are invariant under continuous deformation in plasma conditions satisfying the frozen - in assumption @xcite .",
    "this definition implies that the number of null points does not change and the connectivity of field lines rigidly anchored to the boundaries of the domain is also invariant under the above conditions .",
    "however , we focus here on the evolution of topological elements and connectivity of field lines obtained from force - free models : the field lines are not rigidly anchored ( the models allow for reconnection of field lines ) in order to maintain a force - free state . since the magnetic topology is not required to be preserved , we restrict the definition of the magnetic topology for a given equilibrium state to the ensemble of topological elements forming the magnetic skeleton @xcite . despite an extensive literature on magnetic topology , the theoretical background in three dimensions was developed only recently ( see review by )",
    ". the 3d topological elements constituting the skeleton of a magnetic configuration can be divided into two parts : the true topology containing null points , separatrix surfaces , and separators , and the quasi - topology including quasi - separatrix layers and hyperbolic flux tubes ( and the true topology ) .",
    "we focus especially on the location and properties of null points as a proxy for describing the topology of magnetic configuration .",
    "this study aims at understanding the possible changes of properties and location of null points subject to the continuous variation of a free parameter in various force - free models .",
    "it has been proven that the topological elements of a coronal magnetic configuration are of prime importance to study the onset of flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "for instance , in the classical model of flare , magnetic reconnection occurs at a null point or in a current sheet formed along a topological element .",
    "combining observations and coronal - field models , @xcite have shown that a powerful flare associated with a cme involves a coronal null point and a spine field line .",
    "this topological study in conjunction with euv observations supports the breakout model @xcite as a triggering mechanism for this particular event .",
    "recently , have derived the skeleton of an active region and its temporal evolution before and after an eruptive event .",
    "the authors have found several coronal null points in a quasi - force - free field configuration .",
    "unfortunately , the null points found by did not satisfy the properties of null points for force - free fields and for divergence - free fields ( see appendix a ) .",
    "other topological studies have been carried out to better understand the release of magnetic energy and the reconnection processes in active region evolution @xcite , during blinkers @xcite , and in the quiet sun @xcite    our work has been motivated by two earlier articles on this topic by and . have compared the topology of potential and linear force - free fields for a quadrupolar configuration with a coronal null .",
    "they found that the topology is similar for the point - charge model but they also noticed that for a bipolar model ( based on extended sources ) another null can be created in the linear force - free configuration for large value of the force - free parameter @xmath2 .",
    "based on the point - charge model , reached the same conclusion for different charge distributions .",
    "have considered a quadrupolar point charge , symmetric distribution to study the connectivity of field lines for potential , linear , and nonlinear force - free fields .",
    "they concluded that the topology can be insanely different from one model to the other . for non - symmetric cases , have found that the topology of a force - free configuration can be similar using the point - charge model . as a step forward to the understanding of the magnetic topology of reconstructed coronal fields , we carry out a comparison between different models of magnetic fields ( potential , linear , and nonlinear force - free fields ) for a configuration having a coronal null point assuming a continuous distribution of magnetic field at the bottom boundary and no symmetry .",
    "we describe the changes in the magnetic configurations based on the evolution of the geometry and connectivity of magnetic field lines and in terms of distribution of magnetic energy and electric currents .",
    "in addition , we study the properties of null points as a proxy of the complexity of the field , keeping in mind that the separators and separatrices play an important role in the release of magnetic energy ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that we only focus on the modelling of magnetic - field equilibria and their changes through the increase of electric currents , whilst recently have described the changes in magnetic fields subject to characteristic photospheric motions using a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approach .",
    "they have found that the topology of a quadrupolar magnetic field remains stable whatever the perturbations imposed even in the case of strong currents .",
    "the authors claimed that their results can easily be generalised to more complex magnetic - field distributions and non - generic and symmetric cases . despite their sophisticated mhd approach",
    ", they do not study the changes in magnetic energy or in the connectivity of field lines .    in section  [ sec : mk_np ]",
    ", we construct a magnetic configuration with a coronal null point from which we will reconstruct the different models ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) .",

    "the change in topology in the different models is discussed in section  [ sec : topo ] .",
    "in addition , we study how the magnetic energy is stored ( section  [ sec : nrj ] ) and the electric currents are concentrated ( section  [ sec : cur ] ) .",

    "the four polarities are placed such that there is no symmetry .",

    "however , the magnetic configuration has a topology characterised by quasi - separatrix layers ( qsls ) as shown , in figure  [ fig : bz_quadru ] right , by the red field lines dividing the domain in four distinct regions .",
    "the study of the qsls is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "we note that the simplest magnetic configuration with a topology is a configuration with three polarities as studied in detail by .",
    "we have chosen a quadrupolar configuration in order to confine the null point inside the strong - field region .    to create a coronal null point",
    ", we emerge a polarity n3 ( negative in this experiment ) at the location where there is a field - strength minimum of the quadrupolar distribution ( see figure  [ fig : jz ] left ) .",
    "the total magnetic flux is kept balanced .",
    "we then compute the potential field associated with this new magnetogram , and with the same boundary conditions as in the quadrupolar case .",
    "the height of the null point depends on the field strength of the polarity n3 : for a maximum field strength of 800 g , the null point is located 6.9 mm above the bottom boundary ( see also table  [ tab : prop ] ) . in the following experiment , we will use the vertical component of the magnetic field depicted in figure  [ fig : jz ] left as a boundary condition for the different force - free models .",
    "that we impose on the positive polarities , title=\"fig : \" ]   that we impose on the positive polarities , title=\"fig : \" ]        the computed linear and nonlinear force - free fields are based on the @xcite ( @xcite ) numerical scheme described by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) and .",
    "the same boundary conditions are used for all the models : the vertical magnetic - field component everywhere and the distribution of @xmath2 in one chosen polarity on the bottom boundary , and closed boundary conditions on the sides and top of the computational box .",
    "using the same boundary conditions for all models allows us to perform a direct comparison of the magnetic energy and the topology of the different magnetic configurations .",
    "the force - free field in the volume above the bottom boundary is thus governed by the following equations : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the magnetic - field vector in the domain @xmath4 above the photosphere ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath2 is a function of space defined as the ratio of the vertical current density ( @xmath11 ) , and the vertical magnetic field component ( @xmath12 ) . from equation  ( [ eq : alphaline ] ) , @xmath2 is constant along a field line . in terms of the magnetic field @xmath9 , the grad ",
    "rubin iterative scheme can be written as follows :    @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is defined as the domain on the photosphere for which @xmath12 is positive ( @xmath16 ) or negative ( @xmath17 ) and , @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 the boundary conditions on the photosphere are given by the distribution ( @xmath22 ) of @xmath12 on @xmath10 ( see equation  ( [ eq : bcbz ] ) ) and by the distribution ( @xmath23 ) of @xmath2 on @xmath10 for a given polarity ( see equation  ( [ eq : bcalpha ] ) ) .",
    "we also impose that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the surface of the computational box , @xmath26 refers to the component normal to the surface .",
    "these conditions mean that no field line can enter or leave the computational box .",
    "to ensure the latter condition , we have chosen a bottom boundary large enough for the magnetic - field strength to tend to zero near the edges of the field - of - view .",
    "the linear force - free models are based on the grad ",
    "rubin algorithm where the distribution of @xmath2 is a constant .",
    "we choose values of @xmath2 ranging from 1 to 1 mm@xmath1 with a step @xmath27 mm@xmath1 .",
    "these @xmath2 values correspond to active - region values reported , for instance , by and computed by assuming that the measured photospheric field is force - free .",
    "in addition to the vertical component of the magnetic field , the grad  rubin scheme requires a distribution for the current density ( or @xmath2 ) in order to derive the nonlinear force - free field .",
    "our choice goes to the so - called _ ring _ distribution defined by a second - order hermite polynomial function as follows : @xmath28~\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{r^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is measured from the centre of the source and @xmath30 is a constant that ensures a zero net current .",
    "an example of ring distribution is depicted in figure  [ fig : jz ] right . for the sake of comparison , we choose @xmath31 [ -20 , -10 , 10 , 20 ] ma m@xmath32 , which are characteristic values of the current density in active regions as has been measured in the photosphere from vector magnetograms ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath2 is then given by : @xmath33 in accordance with the grad ",
    "rubin mathematically well - posed boundary - value problem , we impose the distribution of @xmath2 in one chosen polarity ( the positive polarities in this experiment ) as boundary condition for the nonlinear force - free field .",
    "we use the same grid and the same side and top boundary conditions as for the potential and linear force - free fields .",
    "this particular choice of the vertical current distribution is justified by the study reported by rgnier ( 2009 ) , which analysed the behaviour of a simple bipolar field under the assumption of a nonlinear force - free field by using several distribution of @xmath34 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "this study showed that the ring distribution of current gives magnetic configurations that are more stable and in which a large amount of current can be injected .",
    "the conclusion is easily explained by the stabilising effects of the return currents .",
    "ring - current distributions have been used before for simulating twisted flux tubes in mhd models @xcite .",

    "so we first select field lines by considering their footpoints with a field strength above 100 g in absolute value . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on four different distributions which are characteristic of this study : the potential field , two linear force - free field configurations for @xmath36 mm@xmath1 and one nonlinear force - free field with @xmath35 ma m@xmath32 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : geo ] , the scatter plots of the length and height of the selected field lines are shown for the four configurations .",
    "it is clear that the injection of electric currents in a magnetic configuration changes , in a statistical sense , the geometry of field lines compared to the potential field but not the same way for each model .",
    "the changes in geometry are more pronounced for the linear force - free models whilst the geometry remains similar for the nonlinear force - free field . as mentioned above",
    ", the similarity of the nonlinear force - free model and the potential field and the differences with the linear force - free fields are due to the existence of return currents and their stabilising effects .",
    "we now study more closely how the changes in the geometry of field lines evolve when the current density is increased . in figure",
    "[ fig : geo_lfff ] , we plot the cumulative - distribution functions of the length ( left ) and height ( right ) of selected field lines .",
    "we determine that 50% of the field lines are shorter than 25 mm and lower than 5 mm for the potential field whilst 50% of the field lines reaches 50 mm in length and 15 mm in height for @xmath37 mm@xmath1 .",

    "this statement means that the null points found in a potential field with a large spectral radius can be considered as stable null points in other magnetic - field models . even if true for this experiment we need to confirm this statement in a future statistical study of solar active region magnetic fields .",

    "moreover , we emphasize the importance of checking the divergence - free property of the magnetic field in the vicinity of a null point .    sr thanks eric priest and claire parnell ( university of st andrews ) for fruitful discussions on this topic . the computations of force - free field extrapolations have been performed using the xtrapol code developed by t. amari ( ecole polytechnique , france ) .",
