    "one of the essential observations in the theory of nonperiodic , but highly ordered structures is the fact that , in many cases , they can be generated by a certain projection from a higher dimensional ( periodic ) point lattice .",

    "first , we will discuss the above list in more detail .",
    "starting with a substitution tiling , or better a substitution point set @xmath81 in @xmath101 ( cf .  the remark after ( [ cps ] ) ) , the standard construction for the lattice is as follows : let @xmath40 be the substitution factor ( where @xmath40 from now on is always assumed to be a pv number ) and @xmath124 its algebraic conjugates . then @xmath125 now , @xmath126 ( resp .",
    "@xmath127 ) can be chosen as the canonical projections from @xmath128 ( resp .",
    "@xmath129 ) . to be precise , if @xmath130 , then @xmath131 . at this point , we are already able to compute the window set @xmath92 numerically : since the left pf  eigenvector of the substitution matrix contains the the lengths of the prototiles ( cf .  remark after thm .",
    "[ perron ] above ) , the lengths can be chosen such that @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "that is , every @xmath104 can be expressed as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 .",
    "then @xmath135 more general , we may apply the star map to @xmath81 , obtaining the ( countable ) set @xmath136 , which in turn yields the window set @xmath137 .",
    "actually , some of the pictures in the next section were created in essentially in this way : using the substitution to generate a large finite subset @xmath138 , where the points are expressed as @xmath139 above , we plot all points of @xmath140 .",
    "if this set @xmath140 appears to be bounded , even if the number of points is increased , then this is an indication that the considered set @xmath81 is a model set .",
    "to prove rigorously that @xmath81 is actually a model set , one proceeds by showing @xmath122 and @xmath94 . if @xmath92 is a polyhedron , then this is an easy task .",
    "but in the generic case @xmath92 is of fractal nature , and it may be even hard to prove that @xmath92 is of positive measure .",
    "the last thing to prove is @xmath141 , and not just a too small subset . more precisely : let @xmath142 .",
    "then it must hold @xmath143 . in this context",
    "the following theorem turns out to be helpful @xcite .",
    "[ densvol ] let @xmath81 be a model set given by ( [ cps ] ) .",
    "then @xmath144 where @xmath145 denotes the determinant of the generator matrix of @xmath86 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath145 is the volume of any measurable fundamental domain of @xmath86 .      as mentioned above , rauzy fractal is essentially just another term for the window set @xmath92 .",
    "the term rauzy fractal occurs in the context of dynamical systems and number theory , while the terms window or window set arose from the theory of quasicrystals .",
    "originally , rauzy fractal denoted one special fractal of this kind , namely the one arising from the substitution @xmath146 which is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the term generalized rauzy fractal is sometimes used to emphasize the fact that one deals with the more general case .",
    "( of course , this is just a symbolic substitution , but it is trivial to formulate the geometric substitution according to def .",
    "[ substdef ] , cf .",
    "comment after ( [ substn ] ) ) .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the definition of a rauzy fractal is essentially as follows : if @xmath37 is a substitution for @xmath147 prototiles in @xmath101 , where the factor is a pv number of algebraic degree @xmath147 , then the rauzy fractal is just the window set @xmath92 as in ( [ clvstern ] ) , where one does not care about @xmath122 or @xmath94 or theorem [ densvol ] .",
    "note that therefore it is much more difficult to show that a given substitution point set is a model set than it is to compute the corresponding rauzy fractal .",
    "before we proceed , let us mention a theorem which is important in this context and which is necessary in the next section .",
    "[ hutch ] let @xmath148 be a complete metric space and @xmath149 a finite set of contractive maps ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) .",
    "then there is a unique compact set @xmath151 such that @xmath152 .",
    "this theorem is a consequence of the banach fixed point theorem , and is easily generalized to partitions of @xmath153 : let @xmath149 be as above and @xmath154 for @xmath155 , then there is a unique tuple @xmath156 of compact sets @xmath157 , such that @xmath158 for all @xmath155 ( @xcite ) . in the next section",
    ", this theorem will help to show the compactness of the window set @xmath92 .",
    "we will describe the duality principle by choosing a certain one  dimensional substitution , constructing the corresponding rauzy fractal and the associated dual tiling , and then we will use the duality principle to show that the dual tiling is a model set .      it is easy to see , that for any nonnegative integer @xmath159matrix @xmath46 there is a substitution tiling in @xmath101 with substitution matrix @xmath46 .",
    "actually , from any such matrix one can immediately deduce a substitution , since there are only few geometric restrictions for tilings in one dimension .",
    "( the same problem for higher dimensions becomes quite difficult ! ) here we consider the following matrices for @xmath160 : @xmath161 obviously all these matrices are primitive .",
    "a substitution with substitution matrix @xmath162 for the prototiles @xmath163 is given by @xmath164 note that this is just a symbolic substitution .",
    "but in one dimension the geometric realization is obtained from this scheme in a unique way : the prototiles are intervals of different lengths , and the lengths are given by the pf  eigenvector of @xmath162 .",
    "there is a nice trick to deduce the substitution factor directly from this substitutions : for fixed @xmath165 , let @xmath166 . because of the wonderful formula ( see @xcite ) @xmath167 it follows @xmath168",
    ". therefore the substitution factor ( which is the pf  eigenvalue of @xmath162 ) is @xmath169 , and the length of tile @xmath118 is @xmath170 .",

    "the first condition to be fulfilled is that the substitution factor must be a pv  number , cf .",

    "the corresponding characteristic polynomials of @xmath162 are : @xmath175 the latter two are reducible over @xmath176 .",
    "the irreducible polynomials defining @xmath177 and @xmath178 are @xmath179 therefore , the algebraic degree of these numbers is 2,3,3,4 , resp . here",
    "we will focus mainly on the third case ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the first case ( @xmath181 ) leads to the well known fibonacci sequences ( see section [ sec : remarks ] , or @xcite , sections 2.6 and 5.4 ) .",
    "the fourth case ( @xmath182 ) will lead to a three - dimensional rauzy fractal in the end .",
    "the third case ( @xmath180 ) will show the methods and the typical problems which may occur , and therefore we discuss this case in the following in detail .",
    "this part may be regarded as a recipe how to compute other rauzy fractals explicitly .      in this case",
    "we have got four prototiles .",
    "since we consider one  dimensional tilings here , the tiles can be chosen to be intervals .",
    "we denote the four prototiles by @xmath184 ( large ) , @xmath3 ( medium ) , @xmath185 ( small ) and @xmath186 ( extra small ) .",
    "their lengths are already known : they are given by a left pv ",

    "( or any positive multiples of these values ) . in order to construct the rauzy fractal , we need this values as expressions in @xmath188 ( cf .",

    "another unusual property is that each prototile occurs in just one orientation .",

    "( essentially , one uses the definition of a substitution tiling in definition [ substdef ] and the primitivity of the substitution matrix . to show that there are no gaps and no overlaps it suffices to consider all vertex configurations in the first @xmath174 substitutions @xmath300 for appropriate @xmath174 and some prototile @xmath228 .",

    "putting together this with ( [ volw ] ) and ( [ densv ] ) in view of theorem [ densvol ] we obtain @xmath316 the leftmost equality requires again a very lengthy computation , or the usage of maple .",
    "this completes the proof , and we obtain the following theorem .",
    "[ dersatz ] the set @xmath259 in ( [ vstrich ] ) , arising from the substitution @xmath251 in ( [ dualsubst ] ) , is a model set .",
    "one may ask why we do not state that the original set @xmath81 arising from the substitution ( [ subst2 ] ) is a model set .",
    "the reason is that there is one gap , namely , the value of @xmath317 .",
    "for example , one needs to show that the tiling by the fractal tiles @xmath292 is not overlapping .",
    "this seems to be clear from the pictures , but we did not give a rigorous proof here .",
    "indeed , this will require some more work , and we refer to further publications .",

    "the question whether a given structure is a model set is motivated for example by the question for the diffraction property of this structure .",
    "it is known that model sets have a pure point diffraction image , without any continuous part . for details , cf .",
    ".    we did not emphasize it throughout the text , but all tilings considered here are nonperiodic .",
    "for the one  dimensional tilings this is a consequence of the fact that the relative frequencies of the tiles are irrational numbers .",
    "if a one  dimensional tiling is periodic , then the relative frequencies are rational numbers .",
    "anyway , all occurring two  dimensional tilings are nonperiodic , too .",
    "this can be shown with standard tools from the theory of nonperiodic substitution tilings ( cf .",
    "statement 10.1.1 in @xcite ) .    an important point in proving theorem [ dersatz ]",
    "is that we know the occurring values in terms of trigonometric expressions , thus it is possible to make exact computations of @xmath318 , @xmath291 , @xmath319 etc . in general",
    ", the fractal nature of the occurring window sets may forbid this .",
    "but if all occurring sets are polytopes the things become easier . in the following ,",
    "some examples are listed where the duality principle provides short and simple proofs that these considered substitution tilings are model sets .    * fibonacci sequences : * the symbolic substitution @xmath320 gives rise to the widely examined fibonacci sequences .",

    "if one considers the first substitutions of @xmath185 , then the relation becomes clear : @xmath184 , @xmath328 , @xmath329 , @xmath330 , @xmath331 , @xmath327 ) .",
    "a geometric representation as a substitution tiling ( fibonacci tiling ) is for example given by @xmath332,s=[1 , \\tau]$ ] ( @xmath333 the golden ratio ) and @xmath334 by the standard construction ( cf .",

    "nevertheless , the resulting family of substitution tilings for @xmath251 is equal to these for @xmath37 .",
    "that means the dual tilings of fibonacci tilings are fibonacci tilings again ; or shortly : fibonacci tilings are self  dual . moreover , a short computation yields that the equation in theorem [ densvol ] is fulfilled , and therefore the fibonacci sequences are model sets",

    "the corresponding point sets ) are model sets . the duality of the ammann chair tilings and the golden triangle tilings was already indicated in @xcite briefly . but",
    "a proof of this needs some care .",
    "for example , one has to pay attention to the fact , that each prototile occurs in four different orientations , not just in one , as it is true for the tilings in fig .",
