    "in this paper , we aim to study propagation phenomena in some kinetic models .",
    "the main motivation for this work comes from the study of pulse waves in bacterial colonies of _ escherichia coli_. kinetic models have been proposed to describe the run - and - tumble motion of individual bacteria at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "it has been shown recently that these kinetic models are much more accurate than their diffusion approximations , see @xcite and the references therein for details . in this work , and",
    "contrary to works on chemotaxis models , we focus on propagation driven by growth effects ( _  la _ fisher - kpp ) .",
    "this is one major difference between the initial motivation and this paper .",
    "we consider a population of cells which is described by a probability density @xmath0 on @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the velocity space , which is a symmetric subset of @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the velocity of cells changes randomly following a velocity - jump process given by some operator @xmath4 analogous to the scattering operator in radiative transfer theory .",
    "we model the cell division with a kinetic nonlinearity of monostable type .",
    "our kinetic model reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 stands for a _ growth parameter _ and @xmath7 is the macroscopic density in position @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "the _ linear _ operator @xmath10 acting only on the velocity variable describes the tumbling in the velocity space and is _ mass preserving _",
    ", that is @xmath11 we assume that @xmath12 , where the distribution @xmath13 is assumed to be nonnegative and satisfies @xmath14 we note that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are thus stationary solutions of .    a first attempt to understand the long time behavior of kinetic equations such as is to perform scaling limits . due to",
    "the unbiased velocity jump process contained in our model , the diffusive limit seems particularly relevant at first glance .",
    "this issue has been particularly studied in the particular case of a bgk equation without any growth term ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . as a corollary , the fisher - kpp equation can be obtained as a parabolic limit of when @xmath17 .",
    "the long time behavior of this latter parabolic equation is now well understood since the pioneering works of kolmogorov - petrovskii - piskunov @xcite and aronson - weinberger @xcite . for nonincreasing inital data with sufficiently fast decay at infinity , the solution behaves asymptotically as a travelling front .",
    "it is thus natural to study propagation phenomena for kinetic equations such as .",
    "let us emphasize that travelling wave solutions for kinetic equations raised a lot of interest recently .",

    "liu and yu s main result in @xcite is the establishment of the positivity of shock profiles for the boltzmann equation . in @xcite ,",
    "a compactness argument as in @xcite also proves existence and positivity of big waves for a nonlinear bgk equation .",

    "golse @xcite uses compactness properties to prove existence of big waves for the kinetic perthame - tadmor model .",
    "an important technique to derive the propagating behavior in reaction - diffusion equations is to revisit the schrdinger wkb expansion to study hyperbolic limits @xcite .",
    "let us quickly present this approach on the standard fisher - kpp equation , as it contains all the heuristic ideas needed to understand the present work .",

    "this limit phase contains all the information we need to understand the propagating behavior .",
    "more precisely , it is possible to prove @xcite that in the hyperbolic limit @xmath26 , the population is contained in the nullset of the phase @xmath24 .",
    "the main interests of this technique is that @xmath22 can be expected to be more uniformly regular than @xmath27 , and that the full theory of hamilton - jacobi equations and lagrangian dynamics can be used to understand the limit equation . as an example , studying the nullset of @xmath24 , we recover the propagation at the minimal speed @xmath28 for the previous fisher - kpp equation .",
    "this fruitful wkb technique has also much been used to describe the evolution of dominant phenotypical traits in a given population ( see @xcite and the references therein ) and also to describe propagation in reaction - diffusion models of kinetic types @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have proposed a preliminary work on a bgk equation which combines hamilton - jacobi equations and kinetic equations to perform the wkb approach .",
    "this latter work shows that it is necessary to stay at the kinetic level to understand the large deviation regime ; one misses something while performing the wkb approach on a macroscopic approximation of the bgk equation .    in this work ,",
    "we develop the results announced in @xcite for a wider class of linear kinetic equations .",
    "we derive rigorously the hydrodynamic limit of in some special situations given by the hypothesis below .",
    "unless otherwise stated in the sequel , we suppose that @xmath4 takes the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a linear operator that satisfies some structural assumptions that we specify below .",
    "the examples of such operators to keep in mind are the following    our analysis is able to cover local and non - local situations :    1 .",

    "we perform the hyperbolic scaling @xmath39 in . note that at this moment we do not rescale the velocity variable .",
    "by analogy with , our _ kinetic wkb ansatz _ writes @xmath40 we assume that initially @xmath41 as a consequence , thanks to the maximum principle of hypothesis ( h1 ) below , the phase @xmath22 is well defined and remains nonnegative for all times . plugging in",
    ", one obtains the following equation for @xmath22 : @xmath42 to perform the limiting equation , we would rather define the operator @xmath43 and the associated decomposition @xmath44 we can now transform on the following form    @xmath45    this formulation is the kinetic equivalent of what was for the fisher - kpp case .",
    "we shall assume that for all @xmath46 , there exists a unique solution @xmath47 of the cauchy problem associated to given some initial condition @xmath48 .",
    "we stress out that if boundary conditions are needed in the velocity variable , they are implicitly contained in the definition of the operator @xmath49 .",
    "we now formulate our convergence results .",
    "for this purpose , let us specify the assumptions on the different operators involved and on the velocity set @xmath2 .",
    "* [ h0 ] the velocity set @xmath50 is * _ bounded_*. + this hypothesis is very helpful to prove theorem [ hjlimit ] and will be discussed and extended in section [ extensions ] . * [ h1 ] the operator @xmath31 satisfies a _ * maximum principle * _ , which will be used in the following way in the sequel : + suppose that @xmath51 is nonnegative and that @xmath52 attains a maximum in @xmath53 .",
    "then @xmath54    this first hypothesis is rather standard and strong but nevertheless crucial in viscosity solution procedures .",
    "it is structural and not technical .",
    "it is also helpful for space and time lipschitz estimates , see section [ estimates ] . to facilitate lipschitz estimates in velocity",
    ", we will assume a maximum principle for the differentiated operator in velocity .",
    "indeed , in light of the wkb ansatz , let us assume the following    * there exists @xmath55 , an operator satisfying ( h1 ) with @xmath56 and @xmath57 a bounded function such that , @xmath58    this hypothesis holds for our typical examples , see the dedicated section [ estimates ] below .",

    "the main difficulty in the kinetic framework is to understand what to do with the velocity variable in the limit @xmath26 . roughly speaking",
    ", we will show that up to extraction , @xmath22 converges towards a viscosity solution of an hamilton - jacobi equation , whose effective hamiltonian is obtained through an eigenvalue problem in the velocity variable that we write in ( h4 ) below .",
    "in fact , the limiting phase @xmath24 will be independent from the velocity variable , but the kinetic nature of the @xmath75-problem is contained in this following spectral problem .",

    "suppose that the initial data is well - prepared , @xmath86 and that the hypotheses ( h1 ) , ( h2 ) , ( h3 ) and ( h4 ) are satisfied .",
    "then , @xmath87 converges locally uniformly towards @xmath24 , where @xmath24 does not depend on @xmath66 .",
    "moreover @xmath24 is the unique viscosity solution of one of the following hamilton - jacobi equations :    * if @xmath88 , then @xmath24 solves the standard hamilton - jacobi problem @xmath89 * if @xmath90 , then the limiting equation is the following constrained hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath91    where in both cases @xmath77 is an hamiltonian given by ( h4 ) .",
    "we point out that the assumption concerning the non - dependency on @xmath66 of the initial data @xmath92 in theorem [ hjlimit ] is to avoid a boundary layer in @xmath93 when @xmath26 .",
    "the result can be easily extended to the case of an initial condition with small velocity perturbations , that is @xmath94 uniformly in @xmath95 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",

    "we conclude this first part of results with a section [ asymptotics ] , giving refined asymptotics on @xmath97 , and recalling some elements to study the speed of propagation of the fronts when the constrained hamilton - jacobi equation is derived , following @xcite .",
    "the last section [ extensions ] is devoted to discussing the results when the velocity set is unbounded .",
    "we put forward the fact that when the spectral problem of hypothesis ( h4 ) is not solvable , a front acceleration can occur .",
    "finally , we show two cases for which hypothesis ( h4 ) holds and where we expect the convergence result to be also true in the whole space despite additional difficulties .",

    "we now come to the proof of ( ii ) .",

    "doing so and now testing on @xmath120 , we obtain : @xmath121 since @xmath122    as for the uniform bound on @xmath97 , we conclude by performing a @xmath123correction argument .",

    "but , passing to the limit @xmath134 in , and since @xmath24 does not depend on @xmath66 , one gets @xmath135 . this gives ( iii ) .",

    "in addition with a relevant use of corrected tests functions , see @xcite .",
    "indeed , the resolution of the spectral problem of hypothesis ( h4 ) is of main importance to define a corrector in the viscosity procedure , see and .    since we already know that @xmath151 , the remaining properties to be proven to get the result of theorem [ hjlimit ] are gathered in the two following steps :    * # step 1 : viscosity supersolution . *    the statement of the supersolution property does not depend explicitely on the growth part .",

    "however , extending the convergence results in that case will need extra work and this issue will be discussed in a forthcoming work .",

    "we can not perform the same proof as for the proof of theorem [ hjlimit ] . indeed ,",
    "the sequence of approximated extremas in velocity , namely @xmath177 defined after , may not exist in general in a unbounded velocities setting .",
