    "magnetic overlayers , i.e. , the thin films of magnetic materials on the nonmagnetic substrate are systems with great technological potential .",
    "magnetic overlayers are also a convenient system for a deeper understanding of the origin of magnetism in the solid state .",
    "the prototypical system is a magnetic monolayer ( ml ) on a non - magnetic substrate which was the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies in the past @xcite . yet",
    ", a technological preparation , experimental study and detailed theoretical understanding of the overlayer magnetism is still a challenge to solid state physics .",
    "there are a few important features which distinguish magnetic overlayers from conventional magnetic materials .",
    "this is , first of all , the presence of an external agent , namely the presence of a non - magnetic substrate , which can strongly modify the magnetic state and properties of the overlayer system : ( i ) the reduced coordination on the surface induces geometry as well as chemical binding changes .",
    "( ii ) magnetic atoms adapt to the underlying lateral substrate lattice spacings , particularly true for a monolayer case .",
    "( iii ) the substrate electronic structure , in particular the position of the substrate fermi level is relevant for overlayer magnetism .",
    "( iv ) the position of fermi level can be tuned by the substrate electron concentration , e.g. by growing the overlayer on an alloy substrate with varying concentration of the constituents .",
    "alternatively , one could consider a substrate alloy which contains magnetic and non - magnetic species or only magnetic species , and/or a partial coverage of the substrate to vary the properties of the magnetic overlayer .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies on the above trends help to establish a deeper understanding of the origin of surface magnetism .",
    "first - principles calculations represent a powerful tool for such studies , as they allow to determine reliably the underlying lattice structure ( possible layer relaxations , surface reconstructions , etc . ) which can be directly compared with experiment ( leed ) .",
    "they also allow to find out the underlying magnetic structure although in this respect the situation is much more complex .",
    "in addition to collinear magnetic configurations ( ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ones ) more complex configurations may exist ( e.g. recently observed chiral structures in bcc - fe / w(001 ) @xcite , magnetism of random overlayers @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "consequently , an estimation and discussion of exchange interactions is very useful to gain a deeper understanding of properties of both overlayer and bulk magnets and magnetic alloys , including the diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "surprisingly and in contrast to bulk systems , studies of exchange interactions for magnetic overlayers are still very rare @xcite despite of their obvious importance . in particular , the distance dependence of exchange integrals can be very different from that in the bulk if , for example , adatoms can interact via the host surface state as e.g. co - adatoms on the fcc(111 ) faces on noble metals @xcite .",
    "great emphasis , both theoretical and experimental , has been put recently on the study of the magnetic properties of fe - overlayers on the ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) faces of bcc tungsten .",
    "an unusual afm state was predicted theoretically @xcite and confirmed experimentally for the bcc - fe / w(001 ) system @xcite ( in fact , the true ground state seems to be a more complex one exhibiting a chiral state @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence from theory that the ground state of the co / w(001 ) overlayer is afm , whereas mn and cr overlayers have a fm ground state @xcite .",
    "this means that a ( fe , mn)-alloy overlayer on the bcc - w(001 ) should exhibit a crossover from an afm to a fm ground state @xcite .",
    "finally , a similar afm- to fm - crossover was predicted for the bcc - fe/(ta , w)(001 ) alloy substrate system @xcite , where the ground state of the bcc - fe / ta(001 ) is fm .",
    "however , only the leading exchange integrals were estimated in the latter case @xcite .",
    "the ( 001)-faces of the fcc- and bcc - substrates exhibit a simple rectangular array of lattice sites and differ essentially by the @xmath1-ratio , where @xmath2 is the lateral lattice constant and @xmath3 is the interlayer distance .",
    "therefore an investigation of the magnetic properties of fe - overlayers on the ( 001 ) faces of fcc transition metals poses an interesting problem .",
    "a particularly suitable system is the fcc - fe / ir(001 ) where very thin overlayers were grown successfully with negligible fe - ir intermixing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exist reliable leed measurements @xcite elucidating the detailed geometry , while preliminary moke - studies @xcite indicate no magnetic signal in the limit of a monolayer coverage ; a situation similar to the bcc - fe / w(001 ) .    the clean ir(001 ) surface undergoes the @xmath4 quasihexagonal reconstruction .",
    "the finite fe - coverage ( larger than 0.25 monolayer ) lifts the reconstruction @xcite . in order to avoid possible corrugation and fe - ir intermixing the metastable unreconstructed @xmath5-ir(001 )",
    "surface was prepared which is , however , stable for room temperatures and below ( for details see ref .  ) .",
    "the aim of the present study is a comprehensive first - principles investigation of the properties of an fcc - fe / ir(001 ) monolayer system . in a first step",
    "we perform a structural study of fe / ir(001 ) by using two highly accurate dft methods , namely the wien2k @xcite and vasp @xcite codes . in the next step",
    "we investigate the magnetic structure of the geometrically relaxed system by comparing total energies of the non - magnetic ( nm ) , fm- , and afm - configurations ( @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm ) . here , the main problem is the large number of possible magnetic configurations ( including the non - collinear ones ) to be considered . instead of a brute - force search , we evaluate the total energy of the disordered local moment ( dlm ) state similarly to ref .  .",
    "the dlm state is a model state with zero total magnetic moment which results from the disorder of spin orientations of otherwise non - zero local magnetic moments.@xcite a strong indicator for a more complex magnetic state of the system under consideration is a lower total energy of the dlm state as compared to the nm and fm states .",
    "one should note , however , that if some specific magnetic state is the ground state , e.g. , the @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm , its total energy is usually lower than that of the dlm state . on the other hand , in random magnetic systems",
    ", non - collinear states can be the ground state as found , e.g. in fcc - nimn alloys @xcite or in ( cu , ni)mnsb heusler alloys @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the dlm concept was demonstrated recently for both overlayer studies @xcite and disordered magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the dlm picture may be straightforwardly implemented in the framework of the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite .",
    "therefore in a third step , we perform studies based on the green function implementation of the tb - lmto - cpa method @xcite in the framework of the surface green function ( sgf ) approach , in addition to the above mentioned collinear wien2k and vasp calculations .",
    "the tb - lmto - sgf approach employs a realistic semiinfinite sample geometry ( no slabs or periodic supercells ) and allows to implement the dlm model .",
    "the one - electron potentials are treated within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) ; the dipole barrier due to the sample electrons in the vacuum is included in the formalism .",
    "tb - lmto - sgf even allows to include the effect of layer relaxations @xcite , provided , they are known either from full - potential calculations or from experiment .",
    "an important advantage of the tb - lmto - sgf approach is the possibility to estimate exchange interactions between magnetic atoms in the overlayer by a straightforward generalization of the well - approved bulk concept @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the tb - lmto - sgf approach is a very useful tool for a qualitative understanding of the results while the full - potential approaches are superior concerning the quantitative values and thus provide so to say the corner - stones .",
    "we will demonstrate that at least in the present case the results of both types of calculations are in a good quantitative agreement which justifies our assumptions and reinforces our conclusions .",
    "first principle density functional theory calculations were performed using both the all - electron full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp  lapw ) code wien2k and the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp @xcite , using the projector augmented wave scheme @xcite . in the fp",
    "lapw calculations the fe / ir(001 ) systems were modeled by the eleven - layer repeated slab with @xmath7 10    vacuum in between .",
    "all slabs were symmetric with respect to the middle layer .",
    "we allowed the relaxations for top three layers , the remaining interlayer distances were fixed to the bulk values of 1.92   . for vasp repeated asymmetric slabs with seven layers ir and a single fe mono - layer on one side and also symmetric slabs with eleven substrate layers and fe",
    "mono - layers on both sides were used , which were separated by at least 19    vacuum .",
    "all layer distances have been relaxed , and turned out to be essentially the same for both setups .",
    "two dft potential approximations have been employed : the local density approximation @xcite ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) for wien2k ; the gga according to perdew and wang ( pw91 ) @xcite as well as the lda as given by perdew - zunger@xcite ( ceperly - alder)@xcite for vasp .",
    "we have tested nm- , fm- , and @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm magnetic arrangements , all performed in the @xmath6(2@xmath02)-structure for a reliable comparison of total energies . technically , we have used a brillouin zone sampling with 21 - 36 special k- points in the irreducible two - dimensional wedge .",
    "the difference between input and output charge density in the final iteration was better than 0.1 me a.u.@xmath8 .",
    "the total force on single atoms was in every case smaller than 1mry / bohr .    in all tb - lmto - sgf calculations",
    "the lda approximation and experimental layer relaxations @xcite were used .",
    "the vacuum above the overlayer was simulated as usual by empty spheres ( es ) .",
    "electronic relaxations were allowed in four empty spheres adjoining the overlayer , the overlayer itself , and in five adjoining ir substrate layers .",
    "this finite system was sandwiched selfconsistently between an frozen semiinfinite fcc - ir(001 ) bulk and the es vacuum - space including the dipole surface barrier . additionally to nm- , and @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm configurations , we have studied dlm - arrangements .    in the framework of the tb - lmto - sgf method the exchange integrals @xmath9 between sites @xmath10 in the magnetic overlayer",

    "it should be noted that both the direct propagation of electrons in the magnetic overlayer and the indirect one via the ir - substrate are included in eq .",
    "( [ eqj ] ) on an equal footing .",
    "finally , the energy integration extends over all occupied valence states up the fermi energy @xmath16 which is technically performed by integrating over the contour @xmath17 in the complex energy plane . for more details see ref .  .",
    "once the exchange interactions were known , we constructed a two - dimensional ( 2d ) classical heisenberg hamiltonian to describe the magnetic behavior of the fe - overlayer on a non - magnetic fcc - ir(001 ) substrate @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eqh ] ) , @xmath19 denotes the orientation of the fe - magnetic moment at the site @xmath20 . by construction ,",
    "the value of the corresponding magnetic moment is included in the definition of @xmath21 , and positive ( negative ) values denote fm ( afm ) couplings .",
    "an early study of exchange interactions in fcc - fe , co / cu(001 ) systems is found in ref .  , whereas some recent estimates of exchange integrals for a bcc - fe / w(001 ) overlayer were obtained either by a supercell approach @xcite or by an approach closely related to the present one @xcite .",
    "a green - function approach like the present one to calculate exchange interactions has a particular advantage over a supercell approach @xcite : exchange interactions can be evaluated easily and reliably even for disordered overlayers and partial coverages .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of magnetic stability calculations are presented in tables iii - v. different theoretical approaches were used and compared in tables for the unrelaxed geometry ( table iii ) as well as for the realistic , relaxed case ( table iv ) including the possibility of residual adsorbed hydrogen ( table v ) .",
    "it should be noted that one may only compare different lda or gga energies directly to each to other .",
    "our calculations clearly show , that the nonmagnetic case can be safely excluded .",
    "all models with local magnetic moments have a substantially lower total energy .",
    "the most striking result , obtained by all methods , is the fact that while the fm is the ground state for an unrelaxed geometry , the layer relaxations stabilize the @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm phase .",
    "this is in a striking contrast to the closely related bcc - fe / w(001 ) case @xcite where the antiferromagnetism of bcc - fe / w(001 ) is robust with respect to the structural relaxations .",
    "interestingly adsorbed hydrogen also does not change the picture as evident from table v. differences only get smaller , but the general trend is preserved .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm may not be the true ground state of fcc - fe / ir(001 ) .",
    "similar to bcc - fe / w(001 ) one should consider other possibilities , e.g. , the @xmath24(2@xmath01)-afm or even some non - collinear configurations , such as spin - spirals or a chiral state @xcite . to shed some light on this issue",
    "we included in tables  iii and iv the results of dlm calculations as performed in the framework of the tb - lmto - sgf approach .",
    "the sufficient reliability of the tb - lmto - sgf approach for the present purpose is confirmed by a comparison with accurate full potential calculations for nm- , fm- , and @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm configurations in both the ideal and relaxed geometries .",
    "this also justifies the use of the tb - lmto - sgf approach to obtain exchange interactions in the fe - overlayer in the following .",
    "it is quite obvious that , if the dlm state is the ground state compared to the nm- and fm - states , then a more complex , afm - like state can exist and this conclusion can be reached without performing calculations for many possible candidates . but",
    "clearly , this fact does not render the necessity of searching for the true ground state of the system obsolete , but rather represents a reliable qualitative indicator for a more complex magnetic state of the system .",
    "one can speculate about the structural origin of such an afm order .",
    "as already mentioned , both bcc(001 ) and fcc(001 ) have a common square - lattice structure of magnetic atoms which differ by the ratio @xmath3  :  @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the lateral lattice constant and @xmath3 is the layer spacing . for bcc(001 )",
    "we have @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the bulk lattice constant ) while for fcc(001 ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 leading to a larger @xmath3  :  @xmath2 .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath3  :  @xmath2 ratio stabilizes the afm-/dlm - state for this fcc(001 ) surface .",
    "this ratio is sufficiently small for comparable bcc(001 ) surfaces even in the unrelaxed geometry ( see e.g. fe / w(001 ) @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known that the exchange interaction between mn spins becomes antiferromagnetic for smaller distances , a trend we observe here for exchange interactions in the fe - overlayer as detailed below .",
    "this is a first strong indication that indirect interactions of fe - spins via the ir - substrate play an essential role for the fcc - fe / ir(001 ) magnetism .",
    "a dominant character of indirect interactions as compared to direct ones between fe - spins in the overlayer will result in a strong dependence of exchange interactions on the fe - ir interlayer distance as we shall see below .",

    ", width=321 ]    in fig  [ fig1 ] we present the layer - resolved densities of states ( dos ) for the various magnetic states .",
    "compared to the ir bulk , the most important feature observed for all cases is an extra contribution to the overlayer dos around the fermi energy due to the minority fe - states .",
    "the large exchange splitting of majority and minority fe - states is due to the enhanced overlayer magnetic moment ( about 2.65  @xmath30 in all cases ) which illustrates the rigidity of the fe - moment with respect to changing spin - orientations .",
    "the large fe moment is due to the large lateral overlayer lattice constant as given by the ir - substrate as well as to the reduction of coordination number at the surface typical for overlayer systems .",
    "there is also a relevant extra peak in the dos in the vacuum close to the sample surface which gives a possibility to detect it in stm measurements .",
    "we also observe a strong reduction of the fe - overlayer imprint on the deeper ir - substrate layers : already the second ir - substrate layer is almost bulk like . there is a small induced moment on the first - substrate ir - layer of the order of 0.1  @xmath30 while other induced moments are strongly damped in an oscillatory manner ( the friedel - like oscillations ) into the ir - substrates and their values are of the order of 0.01  @xmath30 and smaller .",
    "it should be noted that induced moments in the ir - substrate and in the vacuum are much smaller and more strongly damped in both substrate and vacuum for the @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm case as compared to the fm case , while they even collapse to zero for the dlm state .",
    "the induced moment in the substrate / vacuum are more than two - times smaller as those in the bcc - fe / w(001 ) @xcite .",
    "the above results are confirmed by full - potential slab - model calculations using both wien and vasp codes .",

    "additionally we present results in the dlm state for a simple layer - relaxation model where only the fe - ir interlayer distance is reduced from the unrelaxed value ( 1.92   ) to values of 1.82   , 1.72   , and 1.62     corresponding to a reduction of 5  % , 10.5  % , and 16  % .",

    "a similar approach was successfully used in the study of the complex magnetic stability of bcc - eu : starting from the fm reference state , a proper spin - spiral ground state was obtained in good agreement with the experiment @xcite . due to the sign convention in eqaution",

    "we have investigated the experimentally prepared fe / ir(001 ) system by a combination of different first - principles methods for both supercell slab geometries ( wien and vasp codes ) and semi - infinite boundary conditions ( tb - lmto - sgf codes ) . using the latter approach we investigated the magnetic phase stability of the system by calculating the exchange interactions between fe - atoms in the overlayer .",

    "a  better agreement is obtained for the fe - ir distance using gga rather than lda potentials .",

    "the above results were confirmed both qualitatively and quantitatively by the tb - lmto - sgf approach assuming a semiinfinite sample geometry and experimental layer relaxations as obtained in leed ; ( iv ) the related fcc - fe / rh(001 ) system behaves similarly to fcc - fe / ir(001 ) , although the tendency towards the formation of the afm state upon reduction of the fe - rh interlayer distance is weaker .",
    "we found an indication that a @xmath24(2@xmath01)-afm state is stabilized for larger reductions of fe - rh interlayer distances ; ( v ) a detailed study of the magnetic stability based on the 2d - heisenberg hamiltonian derived from the first - principles total energies confirms the stability of the @xmath6(2@xmath02)-afm state as compared to the fm for relaxed model but indicates that more complex , spin - spiral like state can be stabilized by reducing the fe - ir interlayer distance .",
    "since ir is a heavy element , the spin - orbit interaction can have non - negligible effect on the exchange interactions ( in analogy to the mn / w case@xcite ) , and can lead to chiral magnetic order induced by dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ; and ( vi ) we have shown that increasing fe - ir hybridization stabilizes the afm state .",
    "this seems to be a robust effect to warrant similar stabilization on a much more complex reconstructed ir(001 ) surface .",

    "<S> we present detailed ab initio study of structural and magnetic stability of a fe - monolayer on the fcc(001 ) surface of iridium . </S>",
    "<S> the fe - monolayer has a strong tendency to order antiferromagnetically for the true relaxed geometry . on the contrary an unrelaxed fe / ir(001 ) sample </S>",
    "<S> has a ferromagnetic ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetism is thus stabilized by the decreased fe - ir layer spacing in striking contrast to the recently experimentally observed antiferromagnetism of the fe / w(001 ) system which exists also for an ideal bulk - truncated , unrelaxed geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated layer relaxations for fe / ir(001 ) agree reasonably well with recent experimental leed data . </S>",
    "<S> the present study centers around the evaluation of pair exchange interactions between fe - atoms in the fe - overlayer as a function of the fe / ir interlayer distance which allows for a detailed understanding of the antiferromagnetism of a fe / ir(001 ) overlayer . furthermore , our calculations indicate that the nature of the true ground state could be more complex and display a spin spiral - like rather than a c(2@xmath02)-antiferromagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the magnetic stability of the fe monolayer on the ir(001 ) surface is compared to the closely related fe / rh(001 ) system . </S>"
