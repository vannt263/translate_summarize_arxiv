    "many spintronic devices depend on the injection , manipulation , and detection of spin - polarized currents in semiconductors or normal metals.@xcite spin injection can also be utilized as a tool to probe the spectroscopic properties of strongly correlated and spin - orbit - coupled systems.@xcite thus , understanding the mechanisms of spin injection is of interest for a variety of fundamental and practical applications .",
    "basic theory of spin injection across an f / n ( ferromagnet / normal metal ) interface in the linear response regime was worked out by johnson and silsbee.@xcite the spin polarization of the injected current may be conveniently expressed as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the spin - resolved conductivities of the ferromagnetic electrode , @xmath11 is defined similar to @xmath12 for the spin - dependent interface conductance , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are effective resistances of the ferromagnet and normal metal , respectively .",
    "the effective interface resistance is denoted @xmath15 . for the ferromagnet @xmath16 and for the normal metal @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath5 are the spin - diffusion lengths in the ferromagnet and in the normal metal .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14 are called effective resistances . the expression ( [ pj ] ) is valid under the assumptions of the two - current model , @xcite i.  e.  when the spin - diffusion lengths are much longer than the mean - free paths.@xcite note that nonlinear effects in bipolar semiconducting junctions @xcite can not be described within the linear - response theory and are beyond the scope of the present consideration .",
    "spin injection from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor is subject to the so - called conductivity mismatch problem.@xcite for a typical choice of materials we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that @xmath21 , and if the interface resistance @xmath15 is also small compared to @xmath14 , the injected current is unpolarized , @xmath22 . in order to circumvent this problem",

    "efficient spin injection into gaas and si from transition - metal electrodes was successfully achieved based on this principle .",
    "@xcite    the situation can be visualized with the help of an effective resistor circuit , such that in each spin channel @xmath0 the ferromagnet and the normal metal have resistances @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and the two spin channels are connected in parallel.@xcite this effective circuit correctly reproduces both the spin polarization of the current near the interface and the resistance of the junction in excess of what would be measured if the interface were replaced by a node in the circuit.@xcite    half - metallic ferromagnets @xcite are conducting in one spin channel and insulating in the other , which makes them attractive candidates as electrode materials for spintronic devices.@xcite the situation at zero temperature is simple , as there is only one conducting channel ( `` spin up '' ) , and the injected current should be fully spin - polarized .",
    "many materials , particularly among heusler compounds , have been theoretically predicted using band structure calculations to be half - metallic,@xcite although reliable experimental confirmation is often complicated by surface effects.@xcite high magnetoresistance values were achieved in magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite and spin valves @xcite with epitaxial co - based heusler - alloy electrodes .",
    "large nonlocal spin signals , 10 times higher compared to conventional electrodes , were also demonstrated in lateral spin valves with transparent ohmic interfaces.@xcite in all of these experiments the spin signal is considerably reduced at room temperature but remains appreciable .",
    "further , ramsteiner _",
    "et al . _ @xcite demonstrated spin injection from co@xmath26fesi into an ( al , ga)as light - emitting diode ( led ) structure with an efficiency of at least 50% .",
    "based on their device design , they concluded that the schottky barrier can not be present at the interface and argued that the observed efficient spin injection `` casts doubt onto the common belief that tunneling is a prerequisite for spin injection from a metal into a semiconductor . ''",
    "so far the theoretical analysis of spintronic devices with half - metallic electrodes was based @xcite on the standard spin - diffusion model , @xcite which assumes the existence of two weakly coupled conducting channels in each material.@xcite however , these validity criteria are not satisfied in true half - metals , and our present goal is to develop an appropriate formalism for such devices , which should include the effects of thermal spin fluctuations at finite temperatures .",
    "due to these fluctuations , the electron wavefunctions lose their pure spin character , and the density of states ( dos ) in a half - metal acquires non - zero projection onto the `` spin down '' channel , which is gapped at zero temperature .",
    "however , this state can be viewed as a small perturbation of the fully collinear spin state by fluctuating transverse magnetic fields , so that the local spin direction for all electronic eigenstates is fluctuating within a narrow cone around the magnetization direction . in other words ,",
    "the number of eigenstates is not doubled , but rather they acquire a small spin - down component . in this situation",
    "one can not apply the two - current model , in which independent distribution functions are introduced for spin - up and spin - down electrons , and the concept of the spin - diffusion length also becomes meaningless .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ pj ] ) can not be directly applied to spin injection from a half - metallic electrode at @xmath27 .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze the spin injection from a half - metallic electrode in the linear response regime but without making the assumptions of the two - current model leading to eq .",
    "( [ pj ] ) .",
    "we start with general considerations in section [ general ] and then proceed to analyze the elastic scattering region using the random matrix theory in section [ scattering ] . here",
    "we derive the formula for spin injection efficiency , which is similar to ( [ pj ] ) but with the effective resistance @xmath28 being controlled by spin - flip scattering probabilities at the interface . a generalized statement of the conductivity mismatch follows from the unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "based on these results , we then describe the half - metallic spin - injection system within the spin - diffusion theory in section [ diffth ] .",
    "the formula for spin - injection efficiency is generalized in a natural way to the case of finite spin - diffusion length in the normal region . in section [ properties ]",
    "we discuss the behavior of spin - injection efficiency , and finally in section [ tb ] we support our conclusions with explicit tight binding @xmath0-@xmath1 model calculations .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section [ concl ] .",
    "the electronic structure of a half - metal at @xmath29 has a band gap in one of the spin channels .",
    "if we now consider a thermal fluctuation resulting in a small canting of individual local spin moments , we can imagine , on the level of an the self - consistent field theory in the localized basis , that the effective fields on different atomic sites have been rigidly rotated off of the magnetization axis by small angles .",
    "( the tight - binding representation is assumed for simplicity and is not essential for the physical argument . )",
    "this is a common approach to spin fluctuations within the noncollinear density functional theory , whereby the spin moments are assumed to fluctuate adiabatically slowly compared with electron hopping times.@xcite this approximation is justified by the fact that typical times associated with magnon dynamics are much longer compared to the electron momentum relaxation time .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system with such adiabatic spin fluctuation can then be represented as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the unit vector parallel to the spin moment on site @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the on - site contribution to the hamiltonian from site @xmath32 , and @xmath34 is the spin - diagonal kinetic ( hopping ) part .",
    "we can now make a unitary transformation to the new `` rotated '' local basis in which @xmath33 is diagonal , which is effected by unitary matrices @xmath35 . in this new basis",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath36 at zero temperature there are only states of a particular spin ( say , `` up '' ) near the fermi level .",
    "deviation of the unitary matrices in ( [ hrot ] ) from unity at @xmath27 introduces hybridization between local spin - up and spin - down states , as well as some randomness in the spin - conserving hopping matrix elements .",
    "the bloch states near the fermi level acquire a small admixture of spin - down character , and the dos in the global basis acquires a spin - down component , but no new bloch states appear near the fermi level .",
    "this means that the bulk of a half - metal at finite ( but low ) temperatures can be treated as having one effective spin channel .",
    "this situation is qualitatively different from a conventional ferromagnet with two independent spin channels , even if they have very different resistivities .",
    "while the conventional ferromagnet has two independent occupation functions and chemical potentials for the two spin channels , a half - metal has only one .",
    "transport across an interface with a normal metal is discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "a spin injection device can be analyzed by treating the f / n interface as an elastic scattering region embedded between diffusive regions , and by matching the solution of the scattering problem with the solution of the spin - diffusion equation .",
    "for a conventional two - channel ferromagnetic electrode the well - known result is given by eq .",
    "( [ pj ] ) . however , as we have argued in section [ general ] , the two - current model is inapplicable for a half - metallic electrode . the purpose of this section is to understand the role of spin coherence for spin injection from the half - metal at finite temperatures , i.  e.  in the presence of spin disorder .    since the half - metal , as argued above , has only one effective spin channel , there is no analog of the spin - diffusion length for it .",
    "therefore , inelastic scattering should not affect the properties of spin injection , and we may treat the whole half - metallic electrode as an elastic scatterer . as we will see in the next section , matching with the solution of the spin - diffusion equation in the normal metal should simply replace the resistance of the normal region by its effective resistance @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , we first consider the entire spin - injection device disregarding inelastic scattering altogether .",
    "an elastic spin - injection device can be considered in the formalism of the scattering theory .",
    "we assume that the f - n device is connected on both sides to equilibrium reservoirs via ideal landauer leads .",
    "apart from these leads we introduce an auxiliary lead in the n region at such distance from the interface ( a few mean - free paths ) that the quantum interference effects occurring at the interface are left entirely on the left - hand side of this lead .",
    "each of the two regions can be described by a scattering matrix : @xmath38 where , in the standard way , the matrix @xmath39 contains amplitudes for transmission from the conducting channels of the left electrode across f into the conducting channels of the fictitious lead , and similarly for the other subblocks .",
    "at this point we allow the f region to have an arbitrary magnetic configuration .",
    "the transmission matrix @xmath40 of the entire f - n junction is @xmath41    the charge and spin currents flowing across the junction are proportional , respectively , to @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44 and we are interested in the spin polarization @xmath45 . since we are considering the junction as an elastic scattering region ,",
    "the spin current in the normal region is conserved .",
    "there is no loss of generality from singling out the @xmath46 axis , because its direction is unspecified .",
    "following the approach of waintal _",
    "et al._,@xcite we now introduce the polar decomposition@xcite of the matrix @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the matrix of the eigenvalues of @xmath50 , while @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are unitary matrices , which are all diagonal in spin space .",
    "since the fictitious node can be introduced at a sufficient distance from the surface to eliminate all quantum interference effects , we can safely use the isotropic approximation , @xcite i.  e.  assume that the spatial factors of the unitary matrices @xmath51 , @xmath55 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are distributed uniformly in the unitary group .",
    "we substitute ( [ t ] ) in ( [ j ] ) , use ( [ polar ] ) for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and integrate over the unitary ensemble .",
    "this integration is easily performed using the method of ref .   to the leading order in the number of conducting channels in the leads . in this leading order ,",
    "each unitary matrix is matched to its own conjugate , resulting in a ladder diagram .",

    "this condition implies that @xmath82 . substituting this in ( [ js ] )",
    "we find that @xmath43 vanishes to first order in @xmath64 .",
    "since the charge current is proportional to @xmath64 , this leads to @xmath83 at @xmath84 . in the limit of a two - channel device with weak coupling between the channels",
    ", this result reduces to the conductivity mismatch obstacle for spin injection .",
    "@xcite however , our result is more general , because it is valid for any magnetic structure of the f region and for any choice of the @xmath46 axis .",
    "the only exception is the case of a half - metal at @xmath29 with no spin - flip scattering at the interface , for which the only non - zero component of @xmath71 is @xmath85 ( in the reference frame where the @xmath46 axis is aligned with the magnetization ) . in this exceptional case",
    "we obviously have @xmath86 at any @xmath64 .",
    "let us now find the spin polarization @xmath23 for a finite @xmath64 , assuming that the electrode is an axially symmetric ( i.  e.  collinear ) magnet with spin disorder .",
    "for a macroscopic interface , the summation over the conducting channels automatically averages @xmath87 and @xmath71 in ( [ js ] ) over the spin disorder ensemble .",
    "this self - averaging does not necessarily occur in a point - contact , in which case an additional averaging over spin disorder configuration is required for the spin current ( [ js ] ) and its charge counterpart .",
    "re - expanding the inverse matrix in ( [ js ] ) , we can obtain a series of terms describing multiple scatterings at the interface . since the electron scatters repeatedly from the same spin disorder configuration , the averages of the matrix products do not decouple .",
    "however , since correlations between successive scattering events do not change the asymptotic behavior of @xmath23 , it is a reasonable approximation to replace @xmath65 and @xmath71 by their averages @xmath88 and @xmath89 even for a point contact .",
    "let us assume that spin - orbit coupling at the surface is weak , and that all spin - flip processes are dominated by spin - disorder scattering .",
    "then the matrices @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be invariant with respect to rotation in spin space around the magnetization axis .",

    "the @xmath88 matrix is thus block - diagonal . from the structure of ( [ js ] )",
    "it is clear that we are only interested in the @xmath94 block spanned by indices 1 and 4 .",
    "( the 22 and 33 diagonal elements represent the spin - mixing conductance,@xcite which turns out to be irrelevant to the problem at hand . )",
    "as seen from ( [ rmat ] ) , the diagonal elements of this block are the total spin - conserving reflection probabilities for spin - up and spin - down electrons @xmath95 and @xmath96 , while the off - diagonal elements are the total spin - flip reflection probabilities @xmath97 .",

    "the expression ( [ pjfromt ] ) includes the effects of spin disorder , but not the effects of inelastic spin relaxation . for a conventional ( not half - metallic ) electrode , spin relaxation",
    "must be included on both sides of the junction . in the presence of spin - flip processes at the interface ,",
    "the solution of the spin - diffusion equations becomes rather complicated @xcite even if spin - flip reflection @xmath109 is neglected . the situation is simpler in the case of a half - metallic electrode , because inelastic spin relaxation should only be included in the n region . in the next section",
    "we will see that in this case the elastic resistance of the normal region @xmath14 in ( [ pjfromt ] ) should simply be replaced by its effective resistance .",
    "note that interfacial spin - flip scattering due to spin - orbit interaction was studied in some detail for metallic",
    "n / n and f / n interfaces .",
    "@xcite temperature - dependent interfacial spin - flip scattering in the presence of non - equilibrium spin accumulation was suggested as a source of asymmetric response in a nonlocal spin valve .",
    "in the previous section we found that under rather general assumptions the scattering at the interface between the half - metal and the normal metal is described completely by spin - dependent transmission probabilities and the spin - flip reflection probability on the normal metal side .",
    "the effects of spin coherence are effectively eliminated by spin disorder averaging .",
    "we can therefore use the standard semi - classical treatment , taking into account that the half - metal has only one spin channel , and incorporating spin - flip scattering at the interface . apart from giving a complementary picture of spin injection",
    ", this treatment confirms the expectation about the role of the spin - diffusion length in the normal metal and shows the invariance of the results with respect to the location of the left lead .    instead of treating the whole f / n device as an elastic scatterer",

    "in addition to these terms , we also need to introduce spin relaxation in the normal metal due to spin - flip scattering at the interface",
    ". physically , even if the f electrode is insulating , the spin accumulation in the normal metal can relax through interfacial spin - flip scattering . introducing the appropriate electrochemical potential drops at the interface , the spin - dependent currents on the normal metal side of the interface can be written as follows : @xmath112 where the new term is the one with @xmath113 . matching with the solution of the spin - diffusion equation",
    "can be worked out in the usual way.@xcite the terms containing bulk conductivity in the f region drop out , and after some algebra we reproduce eq .",

    "the reduced magnetization drops to 0.8 at about 75% of the curie temperature , so this limitation is not very restrictive , particularly since the half - metallic gap may be closed by magnetic disorder at much lower temperatures.@xcite a similar estimate applies to nonlocal spin valves with a copper channel , where at room temperature the mean - free path is on the order of 30  nm , and the spin - diffusion length is a few hundred nanometers.@xcite it is possible that efficient spin injection across a transparent interface observed in ref .   can be understood in a similar way .",
    "from the point of view of interface engineering , it is always necessary to avoid the depletion region near the surface.@xcite on the other hand , we would like to point out that in the ohmic regime the existence of interface states in the `` wrong '' spin channel does not necessarily preclude spin injection , as it would with a tunnel barrier .",
