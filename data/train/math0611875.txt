    "this paper examines the dynamics of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluid inside a container whose boundary is deformed slowly . the fluid is assumed to be perfect and incompressible ; consistent with the latter assumption , the area of the container is constant . beyond potential applications such as the control of fluid flows , we use the problem as a paradigm for the study of hamiltonian fluid models depending on slowly varying parameters",
    "this is an obvious first step : the 2d euler equations governing incompressible perfect fluids are indeed hamiltonian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and imposing boundary deformations is arguably the most natural way of introducing a parameter dependence . as is well - known in finite dimensions , hamiltonian systems are strongly constrained ; as a result , slow changes of parameters lead to a remarkable behaviour encapsulated in the theory of adiabatic invariance ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and geometric angles @xcite . in 2d euler , the material invariance of vorticity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) similarly imposes a strong contraint on the system , which we exploit extensively to derive what can be interpreted as fluid - dynamical versions of adiabatic invariance and geometric angle .",
    "the problem we consider here is rather involved in its full generality . to make progress",
    ", we make a number of assumptions and consider the following scenario . at an initial time , a steady flow is given in some simply - connected domain @xmath1 .",
    "the streamlines have the simplest topology , that of nested closed curves , and the flow is arnold stable ( see section [ s : eu0 ] below ) .",
    "we then assume that this continues to hold throughout the evolution as the domain is being deformed . with these hypotheses",
    ", we use an asymptotic approach , based on the separation between the timescales of the boundary deformation and that of the flow , to answer two questions : ( i )  what is the leading - order approximation to the ( eulerian ) flow at any time ; and ( ii )  what is the ( lagrangian ) position of the fluid particles ?    the first question is answered by showing that the leading - order flow is steady at all times .",
    "this makes it possible to rephrase the problem in terms of an area - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath0 which maps the vorticity in the initial domain to the vorticity in the deformed domain .",
    "the uniqueness of @xmath0 up to displacements along lines of constant vorticity , established in wirosoetisno and vanneste ( 2005 ; henceforth wv ) and revisited here , shows that the leading - order velocity field is completely determined by the instantaneous shape of the boundary and is independent of the history of past shapes .",
    "this , of course , is analogous to the adiabatic invariance of the action variables for finite - dimensional hamiltonian systems with slowly varying parameters .    to answer the second question ,",
    "we need to compute the first - order correction to the approximate velocity field obtained in  ( i ) .",
    "this is because the evolution equation for the particle position needs to be integrated over the long time scales required to achieve order - one boundary deformations .",
    "the first - order correction to the velocity field is linear in the boundary velocity , and it can be derived from @xmath2 by solving a pseudodifferential equation . once this is done , the particle - position problem reduces to the solution of ( independent ) one - degree - of - freedom hamiltonian systems with slowly varying parameters .",
    "since particles remain on vorticity contours ( which in effect are contours of constant action ) , only the position along each contour , regarded as an angle variable , needs to be determined .",
    "the value of this angle is found to depend on the history of the boundary shape .",
    "it includes a geometric contribution , similar to the hannay  berry angle , which possesses a nice interpretation @xcite .",
    "we note that the geometric angle has been studied in fluid dynamics by @xcite who considered point - vortex solutions of the 2d euler equation , and by @xcite for stokes flow ; here it appears in the context of smooth inviscid flows .",
    "the determination of the leading - order eulerian flow from the steadiness and vorticity - preservation conditions was treated in wv , where conditions for the existence of @xmath0 and the uniqueness of the resulting velocity field were given in appropriate function spaces for sufficiently small boundary deformations . in the present article",
    "we adopt a more informal approach to treat both the eulerian and lagrangian problems under a slightly different set of hypotheses ; rigorous proof of the adiabatic invariance will be the subject of a future work .",
    "it proves convenient to express our derivation in the language of differential forms in the space of the parameters defining the boundary shape .",
    "this makes explicit the linear dependence of several important quantities on the boundary velocity , and it gives a natural description of the geometric angle in terms of a curvature form in the parameter space .",
    "we use this language mainly as a notational tool , but it is clear that a more abstract geometric interpretation of the results could be given .",
    "this is discussed at the end of the paper .    in the following section , we present a short description of the 2d euler equation in a deforming domain in order to fix the notation , and we consider the behaviour of the leading - order eulerian flow .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ s : eu1 ] we compute the first - order correction to the eulerian flow , which depends only on the instantaneous shape of the boundary and its velocity . using these results",
    ", we study the lagrangian flow in  [ s : lag ] , where the geometric angle of the particle position is derived . in these sections , we consider general domains and arbitrary boundary deformations , requiring only that the boundary deformation be slow .",
    "the results are given as solutions of partial ( pseudo)differential equations , which in general will have to be solved numerically . in ",
    "[ s : small ] we develop a perturbative approach for the solution of these equations , based on the assumption of small ( total ) boundary deformation .",
    "we carry out the calculation to second order , but the lie series formulation that we employ is well suited for systematic extensions to higher orders .",

    "if h1 fails , the flow ceases to be arnold stable and likely becomes spectrally unstable .",
    "we can then expect the flow to become highly unsteady and , in the absence of dissipative mechanisms , remain so regardless of subsequent deformations of the domain .",
    "the failure of h2 , on the other hand , corresponds to the appearance of streamlines for which the orbiting period of particles becomes large .",
    "when the period becomes comparable with the time scale of the domain deformation , our asymptotic approach clearly breaks down .",
    "this can happen when the flow is driven by the domain deformation towards a change in topology , with the creation of hyperbolic stagnation points and separatrices .",
    "how the flow evolves in this situation is unclear , but some understanding could be gained by investigating the problem where the initial steady flow @xmath132 has a hyperbolic stagnation point ( and satisfies h1the kelvin ",
    "stuart vortex in @xcite is just one example ) .",
    "this problem can be viewed as a generalisation of the classical critical - layer problem for parallel shear flows ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in this generalisation",
    ", the separatrix plays the role of the zero - velocity critical line ( along which h2 is obviously violated ) ; by analogy , it can be expected to be also surrounded by a narrow critical layer where complicated nonlinear dynamics occurs .",
    "we plan to investigate this problem in future work .",
    "we conclude this paper by remarking on the possible extension of our results to flows in three dimensions . in three dimensions ,",
    "the dynamics of an inviscid and incompressible fluid is determined , as in two dimensions , by a form of conservation of vorticity , although in this case it is as a vector that the vorticity is transported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that our approach for the determination of the leading - order eulerian flow in deforming domains can be adapted to the three - dimensional setting .",
    "the technical conditions for the well - posedness of the equations for @xmath0 are however likely to be significantly more complicated than in two dimensions .    the evolution of the fluid - particle position seems , at first sight , to pose a very different problem in three than in two dimensions , since the velocity field is divergence - free and not hamiltonian . however , particle trajectories for ( non - beltrami ) steady solutions of the euler equations are known to be integrable @xcite because they are confined to surfaces of constant bernoulli function ( lamb surfaces ) .",
    "there is , therefore , a simple characterisation of the fluid - particle positions in steady flows , analogous to the action ",
    "angle characterisation in two dimensions .",
    "this could be used for slowly time - dependent flows to quantify the effects of a cyclic boundary deformation as was done to obtain the geometric angle in this paper .",
    "a general difficulty with three - dimensional flows , however , is the absence of general stability results similar to those obtained by the energy ",
    "casimir method @xcite .",
    "instabilities can not therefore be excluded ( on the contrary , they are the rule rather than the exception ) , and the effect of their competition with the slow evolution of the leading - order flow would need to be assessed carefully",
