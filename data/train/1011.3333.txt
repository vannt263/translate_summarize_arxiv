    "the  work presented in this paper is motivated by some problems encountered in the design of experiments in a clinical trial to establish the pharmacokinetics of uzara , a digitoxin related herbal diarrhea medication [ based on @xcite ] .",
    "these kinds of trials pose methodological design challenges because they require the estimation of global population parameters in the presence of correlated measurement errors .",
    "the  trial in question included a number of patients each given an oral application of uzara as well as , after a washout period , an intravenous application of digoxin ( lanicor ) , where in both cases the resulting serum concentration of digitoxin was measured repeatedly during the next @xmath0 hours .",
    "the  relation between the time and the concentration in the analysis of the uzara  trial can be described using the theory of one - compartment models with oral and , respectively , intravenous applications [ @xcite , @xcite ] . in the intravenous case ,",
    "the medication reaches the maximum concentration in the blood almost immediately , and , after that , it is gradually eliminated from the body over time .",
    "thus , the digitoxin concentration is modeled using the exponential elimination model @xmath1 in the case of the oral application , there is a gradual build up of the concentration in the blood as the medication is absorbed through the digestive tract , while there is a simultaneous elimination process of the medication in the blood .",
    "therefore , the concentration function is the solution of the differential equation of these two parallel processes .",
    "the  resulting function @xmath2 is known as the ( @xmath3 parameter ) bateman function [ @xcite ] . in both models , the function @xmath4 denotes the concentration function , @xmath5 is the time ( in hours ) , @xmath6 and , respectively , @xmath7 are the vectors of parameters .",
    "the  parameters are assumed to vary between patients and the aim of the experiment is to estimate their global means ( and sometimes variances ) over all patients .",
    "measurements within the same patient are usually correlated , and we assume this correlation to be proportional to the time lag between measurements , which is plausible as the random errors are usually caused by temporary changes in the patients physical condition .",
    "measurements for different patients are assumed to be independent . in the trial at question thuermann",
    "considered @xmath8 ( oral ) , respectively , @xmath9 ( intravenous ) measurements each on @xmath10 patients . after a preliminary discussion with experts",
    "the measurements were taken at nonoptimized time points .",
    "an approximation of the covariance of a single patient can then be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the vector of expected responses at @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the covariance matrix corresponding to this data .",
    "this expression includes two sources of variation , the usual variation @xmath14 caused by random errors as well as the additional variation @xmath15 due to the random effect .",
    "situations of this kind are rather common in the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of drugs [ see @xcite , @xcite , among others ] .",
    "the  corresponding processes are usually modeled by linear or nonlinear random effects models , which try to estimate the population parameters , that is , the mean and the inter - individual variability of the parameters . under the additional assumption of a normal distribution ,",
    "the population characteristics are usually estimated by maximum likelihood methods . in many cases ,",
    "the likelihood can not be evaluated explicitly and approximations are used to calculate the estimate .",
    "efficient algorithms for estimation are available for this purpose [ see @xcite ]",
    ". loosely speaking , under a gaussian assumption this approach corresponds to weighted nonlinear least squares estimation .",
    "it was pointed out by several authors that the application of an appropriate design in these studies can substantially increase the accuracy of estimation of the population parameters .",
    "usually , the construction of a good design is based on the fisher information matrix which can not be derived explicitly in pharmacokinetic models with random effects .",
    "for this reason , many authors propose an approximation of the likelihood [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) , among others ] , which is used to derive an approximation for the fisher information matrix .",
    "this matrix is considered in various optimality criteria , which have been proposed for the construction of optimal designs for random effect regression models .    in the present paper",
    "the investigation is motivated by the following issues .",
    "first , the estimation of the population mean and the construction of corresponding optimal designs for population pharmacokinetics strongly depends on the gaussian assumption , which is usually made for computational convenience .",
    "moreover , the maximum likelihood estimates may be inconsistent if the basic distributional assumption is violated . as a consequence",
    ", the derived optimal designs might be inefficient .",
    "second , most authors derive the approximation for the fisher information matrix under the additional assumption that the random errors corresponding to the measurements of each individual are uncorrelated [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among many others ] .",
    "however , this assumption is not realistic in many applications of population pharmacokinetics .",
    "thus , a general concept for constructing optimal designs in the presence of correlated observations is still missing .",
    "third , even if the gaussian assumption and the assumption of uncorrelated errors for each subject can be justified , the numerical construction of the estimate and the corresponding optimal design is extremely hard .    in the present paper",
    "we address these issues . to derive a good design , we consider nonlinear least squares estimation in random effect regression models . note that this estimation does not require a specification of the underlying distributions . for this estimation",
    ", we introduce a methodology which can be used to derive efficient or optimal designs in very general situations .",
    "more precisely , we embed the discrete optimal design problem in a continuous optimal design problem , where a nonlinear functional of the design density has to be minimized or maximized .",
    "this approach takes into account the correlation dependence and yields an asymptotic optimal design density , which has to be determined numerically in all cases of practical interest . for finding the optimal density",
    ", we propose an algorithm based on polynomial approximation . for a fixed sample size and for each individual",
    ", an exact design can be obtained from the quantiles of the corresponding optimal distribution function .",
    "it is demonstrated by examples that these designs are very efficient .",
    "moreover , the designs , derived from the asymptotic optimal design density , are very good starting designs for any procedure of local optimization for finding the exact optimal designs . to our knowledge",
    ", the proposed method is the first systematic approach to determine optimal designs for linear and nonlinear mixed effect models with correlated errors .",
    "the  remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we consider the case of a linear random effect model and explain the basic design concepts . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce the approach for deriving the asymptotic optimal designs for linear regression models with correlated observations by employing results of @xcite . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present results for nonlinear regression models with correlated random errors and derive @xmath16-optimal designs and optimal designs for estimating the area under the curve in the compartmental model . finally , the uzara and lanicor trials are re - analyzed and",
    "optimal designs for the model ( [ 3prambat ] ) are determined .",
    "in particular , we show that the design proposed by the experts is rather efficient , while a naively chosen equidistant design can yield substantially less accurate estimates .",
    "consider the common random effect linear regression model @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the @xmath19th observation of the @xmath20th subject at the experimental condition @xmath21 , @xmath22 are centered random variables with variances depending on  @xmath5 , @xmath23 for some positive function @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a given vector of linearly independent regression functions , and @xmath26 is a @xmath27-dimensional random vector representing the individual parameters of the @xmath20th subject , @xmath28 .",
    "the  explanatory variables @xmath21 can be chosen by the experimenter from a compact interval @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that errors @xmath30 for different subjects are independent , but the errors for the same subject are correlated , that is , @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] is a constant , @xmath33 is a given correlation function such that , and @xmath34 denotes kronecker s symbol .",
    "let @xmath14 be the corresponding covariance matrix .",
    "assume that the individual parameters @xmath26 are drawn from a population distribution with mean @xmath35 and covariance matrix @xmath15 , and they are independent of the random variables @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the covariance between two observations at the time @xmath21 and the time @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is @xmath39 while the variance of @xmath18 is given by @xmath40 .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that an optimal design necessarily advises the experimenter to perform observations of all subjects at the same experimental settings , that is , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "consequently , we define an exact design @xmath44 as an @xmath45-dimensional vector which describes the experimental conditions for each subject . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that the design points are ordered , @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that @xmath45 observations are taken according to the design @xmath47 .",
    "then the model for the @xmath20th subject can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , the matrix @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is now a centered random variable with variance @xmath53 .",
    "this model is a special case of the random - effect models discussed in @xcite , which are called generalized manova .",
    "according to @xcite , the ( ordinary ) least square estimate of @xmath35 minimizes @xmath54 define @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then the covariance matrix of the ordinary least squares estimate @xmath57 is given by @xmath58\\\\[-8pt ] & = & \\frac{1}{k}\\bigl((x^tx)^{-1}x^tv_\\varepsilon x(x^tx)^{-1}+v_p\\bigr).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alternatively , if the covariance matrix @xmath14 of the errors and the covariance matrix of the random effects @xmath15 were known ( or can be well estimated ) , the ( weighted ) least squares statistic @xmath59 can be used to estimate the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the  covariance matrix of the estimate @xmath60 is given by @xmath61    since the expression is simpler than ( which requires two different inversions ) , the design methodology developed in this paper is based on the covariance matrix of the ordinary least squares estimate . additionally , we will demonstrate that the optimal designs obtained by minimizing functionals of the covariance matrix of the ordinary least squares estimate are also very efficient for weighted least squares estimation .",
    "we call a design optimal design if it minimizes an appropriate functional of the covariance matrix of the least squares estimate .",
    "since we consider optimality criteria that are linear with respect to scalar multiplication of the covariance matrix , we put @xmath62 without loss of generality .",
    "although the theory of optimal design has been discussed intensively for uncorrelated observations [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ] , less results can be found for dependent observations . for linear and nonlinear random effect models , optimal designs under the assumption of uncorrelated errors have been investigated in @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite , among others . for fixed effect regression models with the presence of correlated errors ,",
    "it was suggested to derive optimal designs by asymptotic considerations . @xcite",
    "( @xcite ) have considered a fixed design space , where the number of design points in this set tends to infinity . as a result",
    ", the asymptotic optimal designs depend only on the behavior of the correlation function in a neighborhood of the point @xmath63 . in the present paper",
    "we use the approach of @xcite and @xcite , who have considered a design interval expanding proportionally to the number of observation points .",
    "this case is equivalent to the consideration of a fixed interval with the correlation function depending on the sample size . to be precise , we assume that the design space is given by an interval @xmath29 and the design points of a sequence of designs @xmath64 are generated by a function @xmath65 in the form @xmath66 and @xmath67\\to t $ ] denotes the inverse of a distribution function .",

    "we derive an asymptotic representation for the covariance matrix of the least squares estimate in the following lemma . for this purpose , we impose the following regularity assumptions :    1 .",
    "the  functions @xmath79 are linearly independent , bounded on the interval @xmath29 and satisfy the first order lipschitz condition : @xmath80 2 .",

    "the  correlation function @xmath84 is differentiable with bounded derivative and satisfies @xmath85 for sufficiently large @xmath5 .",
    "assumption ( c1 ) refers to the continuity of the response as a function of @xmath5 and it is satisfied for most of the commonly used regression models . moreover , most of the commonly used correlation structures satisfy assumption ( c3 ) on a compact interval .",
    "finally , assumption ( c2 ) refers to the characteristics of a design , requiring , loosely speaking , that observations should not be clustered .",
    "this is quite reasonable due to ethical aspects .",
    "the  following result is obtained by similar arguments as given in @xcite and , hence , its proof is omitted .    assuming that conditions , and are satisfied",

    "the  application of the proposed methodology to other optimality criteria is straightforward .",

    "we found that the minimal value of the criterion is negligibly decreasing for polynomials of degree larger than @xmath112 .",

    "the  results were very similar and , on the basis of our numerical experiments , we can conclude that the optimal density @xmath101 can be very well approximated by 6-degree polynomials .",
    "the  derived designs from the asymptotic theory can be used to construct efficient designs for a given sample size as specified in step ( 3 ) of the algorithm .",
    "alternatively , exact optimal designs can be determined by employing the derived designs as initial values in a ( discrete ) optimization procedure .",

    "this variance is approximately proportional to @xmath173 this expression corresponds to the @xmath103-optimality criterion , which has been discussed extensively in the literature for fixed effect models with uncorrelated observations [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others ] . the  asymptotic optimal design densities for estimating the area under the curve",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : densn_auc ] .",
    "we observe again that the optimal density is close to the uniform design density if @xmath123 or @xmath122 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath120 is large or @xmath124 , the auc - optimal design density has a narrow support .",
    "this fact reflects that the optimal design for estimating the area under the curve in the fixed effect compartmental model with uncorrelated observations is a one - point design . in figure",
    "[ fig : compn2_auc ] we show the designs derived from the asymptotic optimal design densities , and the exact optimal designs for estimating the area under the curve in the compartmental model .",
    "we observe that the designs @xmath174 , derived from the asymptotic optimal design density , are very close to the exact optimal designs for least squares estimation of the area under the curve .",
    "moreover , the design @xmath132 yields a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to the uniform design .",
    "again we observe that the designs derived for ordinary least squares estimation also have excellent efficiencies for weighted least squares estimation of the auc ( see the right part of figure [ fig : compn2_auc ] ) .",
    "defined by .",
    "left part : @xmath175 , right part : @xmath153 . ]        and @xmath131 for ordinary and weighted least squares estimation of the auc .",
    "the  parameters are given by , where @xmath139 . ]      in this section we consider the optimal design problem for estimating the auc in the two examples presented in the introduction .",
    "the  medical background of these examples was a small pilot trial of 4 patients [ @xcite ] , where it was observed that patients taking the over - the - counter herbal diarrhea medication uzara  ( in the form of drops , i.e. , oral application ) showed high values in medical assays designed to measure the blood serum concentration of digitoxin , a potent treatment against heart insufficiency .",
    "this is caused by the chemical similarity of these two substances and can result in major complications in establishing treatment programs for heart insufficiency .",
    "it was thus decided to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of an oral application of uzara  to the properties of the usual intravenous application of a regular digitoxin medication ( lanicor ) on a larger sample size of 18 patients , with 15 measurements each .",
    "the  main focus of the comparison was the area under the concentration curve as a measure of the total effect of an application .",
    "a preliminary design was proposed by experts in order to allow precise estimation of this property , and the study was carried out according to this design .",
    "we will now investigate the efficiency of this and a naively chosen equally spaced design compared to a design generated using the methods presented in this paper .    in order to compute the design densities ,",
    "it is necessary to estimate the parameters for both of the models .",
    "to do so , we used the full 18 patient data set , however , this could have been done as well using only the 4 patients of the pilot study .",
    "we estimated parameters using a combination of maximum likelihood and least squares techniques [ see @xcite ] .",
    "for the intravenous part corresponding to model , we have received the estimates @xmath176 , @xmath177 for the population parameters , while the estimates of the parameters in the covariance matrix are given by @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 .    for the oral application corresponding to model , the estimates of the parameters",
    "are given by @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath178 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "note that the entries in the positions @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 are not identical @xmath63 , but smaller than @xmath189 .",
    "based on a preliminary discussion with experts , the physicians decided to take measurements for both experiments at nearly identical ( nonoptimized ) time points @xmath190 and @xmath191 respectively .",
    "note that in the second design an additional measurement was taken at @xmath192 , that is , before the intravenous injection .",
    "since this point is out of the scope of the exponential evasion model , the observation at this time has been excluded from further considerations .",
    "thus , the lanicor trial has @xmath9 observations .",
    "-parameter bateman ( left part ) and exponential evasion model ( right part ) . ]    for the estimated parameters , we have derived the asymptotic optimal design densities , which are depicted in the left and right part of figure [ fig : uzara_densn_auc ] for the uzara and lanicor trials , respectively , where the design interval is given by @xmath193 $ ] .",
    "the  resulting designs from these densities are given by @xmath194 for the uzara trial and @xmath195 for the lanicor trial .",
    "this means that the asymptotic optimal design for the oral application is close to an equally spaced design , while the optimal design for the intravenous application is much more focused on measurements at early time points .",
    "this result is plausible in an exponential elimination model . calculating the efficiencies for ordinary least squares estimation of these asymptotic optimal designs compared to the exact optimal design , we obtain efficiencies @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively , indicating that these designs are quite good .    upon numerical studies",
    ", we can further conclude that the constructed designs are robust to misspecification of the initial guess of parameters .",
    "for example , variations of @xmath120 ( or any of the other parameters ) by up to 50% yield a drop of efficiency by less than @xmath198 .",
    "note that in the examples presented in sections [ sec3 ] , [ sec4.1 ] and [ sec4.2 ] , the efficiencies of the derived designs for weighted least squares estimation are very similar to the efficiencies for ordinary least squares estimation , and a similar observation has been made for the two trials under investigation .",
    "the  efficiencies for weighted least squares estimation of the designs based on the asymptotic density are 99% ( uzara ) and 97% ( lanicor ) , even better than the efficiencies for ordinary least squares estimation .",
    "we now investigate the performance of the designs which were actually used in the clinical trial .",
    "we found that these designs have efficiency @xmath199 and @xmath200 for estimating the auc through ols estimation in the uzara and lanicor trials , respectively .",
    "thus , the preliminary designs , recommended by experts , are rather efficient in both trials .",
    "let us now investigate the performance of naively chosen equidistant designs : the design @xmath201 for the uzara trial , and the design @xmath202 for the lanicor trial . comparing these designs to the optimal designs , we obtain efficiencies of @xmath203 and @xmath204 for ordinary least squares estimation of the auc in the uzara and lanicor trials , respectively .    it was pointed out by a referee that it is of some interest to investigate the performance of the optimal designs proposed in this paper for the estimation of the variance of the random effects ( i.e. , the parameters of the matrix @xmath15 ) .",
    "these parameters are usually estimated by maximum likelihood techniques [ see @xcite , among others ] and the corresponding information matrix of these estimates is of a fundamentally different structure compared to the variance matrix of the least squares estimate .",
    "for the two optimal designs we have calculated the @xmath16-efficiencies for estimating the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath15 , which are @xmath205% and @xmath206% in the uzara and lanicor trial , respectively .",
    "the  designs actually used in the trial have efficiency @xmath207 and @xmath208 , while the corresponding efficiencies of the uniform designs are @xmath207 and @xmath209 , respectively .",
    "thus , the proposed optimal designs for auc - estimation also have reasonable efficiency for estimation of the covariance matrix of the population distribution .    summarizing the discussion in this example",
    ", we conclude that the equally spaced design in the uzara trial is very close to the optimal design determined by the proposed methodology , and it is for this reason very efficient .",
    "however , the equally - spaced designs do not always have high efficiency . in the lanicor trial , the use of naively chosen designs yields considerably less accurate estimates . for this reason , the application of experimental design techniques in the context of pharmacokinetics trials is strictly recommended .",
