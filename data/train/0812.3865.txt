    "currently the observational evidence coming from supernovae studies @xcite , cosmic background radiation fluctuations @xcite , and baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , set a strong case for a cosmological ( concordance ) universe model composed by nearly @xmath0 percent of a mysterious component called dark energy , responsible for the current accelerated expansion , nearly @xmath1 percent of dark matter , which populate the galaxies halos and a small percent ( around @xmath2 ) composed by baryonic matter .",
    "the nature of these two dark component remains so far obscure @xcite . in the case of dark matter",
    ", we have a set of candidates to be probed with observations and detections in particle accelerators , however the case of dark energy is more elusive .",
    "this component not only has to fill the universe at the largest scale homogeneously , and to have the appropriate order of magnitude to be comparable with that of dark matter , but also has to have a negative pressure equation of state , something that was assumed first to explain inflation in the early universe , inspired by high energy theories of particle physics , but which seems to be awkward to appeal for , at these low energy scales .",
    "the alternative way used to account for the cosmic acceleration is to consider a modification of general relativity at large scales @xcite .",
    "however it seems to be a difficult route to follow , considering the subtleties in the interpretation of the observations even in the simplest model based on general relativity . to describe the universe at the largest scale , as is the case in cosmology , we have to make certain assumptions regarding the local distribution of matter and its characteristics . as is well known ( and explained in several classic books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) the energy - momentum tensor used in the einstein s equations is imported from considerations made in special relativity , through a covariant generalization supported by the equivalence principle .",
    "the assumption about homogeneity and isotropy leads to consider the matter content of the universe as a fluid . in the case of a perfect fluid , defined as a mechanical medium incapable of exerting transverse stresses",
    ", it takes the standard diagonal form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is identified as the energy density of the fluid , @xmath5 is the proper hydrostatic pressure , @xmath6 are the components of the macroscopic velocity of the fluid with respect to the actual coordinate system and @xmath7 is the metric of it . the expression ( [ temunu ] ) is what is measured by an observer at rest in the fluid , who examines an element of the fluid small enough so that gravitational curvature can be neglected .",
    "the conclusion of applying the energy conservation relation to this tensor @xmath8 is that perfect fluids behave adiabatically when examined by a local observer , satisfying the equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the physical volume of the region considered .",
    "is usual to take as the volume @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a physical distance of the order of the region we are interested in . using that @xmath13",
    ", leads to the well know result @xmath14 to get this result , it was assumed also that particle number is conserved @xmath15 , where @xmath16 with @xmath17 the particle number density . a way to modify ( [ ds0 ] ) without spoiling adiabatic evolution is by adding a work term due to the change of the particle number @xmath18 . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied this case as an alternative cosmological model , considering the change of the particle number , assuming that such a correction have to be considered during matter creation .",
    "this work actually suggested for the first time , a way to incorporate the particle creation process in the context of cosmology , in a self consistent way .",
    "in fact , the original claim made by zeldovich @xcite , that gravitational particle production can be described phenomenologically by a negative pressure , is realize here in a beautiful way .",
    "a covariant formulation of the model was presented in @xcite .",
    "the context where these considerations would be important were mentioned to be ; the steady - state cosmological model , the warm inflationary scenario and within the standard inflationary scenario , during the reheating phase .",
    "based on this work , the studies of cosmological models with matter creation @xcite were initiated , which were rapidly recognized as be potentially important to explain dark energy @xcite . in particular , in ref.@xcite the authors established a model where dark energy can be mimicked by self - interactions of the dark matter substratum . within the same framework ,",
    "models of interacting dark energy and dark matter were proposed @xcite .",
    "actually , in these studies is possible to have consistently , a universe where matter creation proceeds within an adiabatic evolution .",
    "more recently , lima et al.,@xcite have presented a study of a flat cosmological model where a transition from decelerated to accelerated phase exist .",
    "they explicitly show that previous models considered @xcite , does not exhibit the transition , and study the observational constraints on the model parameters . in this work",
    "i consider non flat models where by modifying the first law , enable us to explain the current acceleration of the universe expansion through a fictitious pressure component coming from changes in the total particle number . in this way ,",
    "the dark energy component is basically an effect due to the dark matter creation process in the universe , fact that enable us to explain easily the cosmic coincidence problem ; it is not strange to have a similar contribution from these two component , because they are just one component ; dark matter .",
    "i also demonstrate that a non constant matter creation rate can indeed lead to a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated regime even in the case of non flat geometries . in the next section",
    "i derive the equations of motion in the case of matter creation .",
    "then , i open section iii with a very simple model with a non constant creation rate , that resemble the @xmath19cdm model .",
    "after this , i discussed the case of the transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion in non flat models .",
    "the incorporation of the variable @xmath18 into the cosmological scenario , modifies the first law as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the enthalpy ( per unit volume ) , @xmath22 is the number density and @xmath4 is the energy density .",
    "the important thing to stress here is that the universe evolution continues to be adiabatic , in the sense that the entropy per particle remains unchanged ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the extra contribution can be interpreted as a non thermal pressure defined as @xmath24 this is the source that produces the current acceleration of the universe expansion .",
    "once the particle number increases with the volume ( @xmath25 ) , we obtain a negative pressure . now , because we are considering matter creation , we have to impose the second law constraint as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the entropy density . from ( [ firstlaw ] )",
    "we find that the new set of einstein equations are @xmath28 @xmath29 and from ( [ second ] ) we have to supply an extra relation between @xmath17 and the hubble parameter @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a definite positive function .",
    "the set of equations ( [ friedman ] ) , ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ ene ] ) completely specified the system evolution .",
    "the standard adiabatic evolution is easily recovered : setting @xmath32 implies that @xmath33 , which leads to the usual conservation equation from ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that eq.([rho ] ) enable us to determine the pressure ; for example if @xmath34 eq.([rho ] ) implies @xmath35 , and furthermore if @xmath36 and @xmath37 implies @xmath38 .",
    "let us assume first here that @xmath39 the arguments in favor of this hypothesis would be given in short .",
    "let us study here its consequences . if we consider @xmath40 , relation ( [ asump1 ] ) leads to @xmath41 . from ( [ ene ] )",
    "we finds the solution for the density number to be @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a constant of integration . assuming @xmath34 as for non - relativistic matter ( that leads to que usual equation of state @xmath35 as we discussed that at the end of the last section )",
    ", we get for the energy density @xmath44 that resembles the combined contribution of a cosmological constant and dust .",
    "the level of fine tuning here to obtain an accelerated expansion is relatively smaller than in the usual @xmath19cdm model , because in this case , both terms come from the same function , and we know that we can obtain an accelerated expansion phase after some time from ( [ friedman ] ) .",
    "note however that the equation of state has not been modified , @xmath4 is still the non - relativistic contribution .",
    "we do not have to introduce any exotic component - with a negative pressure - to describe the current expansion acceleration . given the current status of the dark matter and dark energy problem @xcite",
    ", we can use this idea as a possible way to understand it . in terms of the exotic dark energy fluid with energy density @xmath45 and pressure @xmath46 , the solution ( [ rhosol ] )",
    "can be expressed as @xmath47 where now there must be two copies of eq.([rho ] ) with the one corresponding to dark energy being @xmath48 and @xmath17 stand only for the second term in eq .",
    "( [ rhosol ] ) . of course , from eqs .",
    "( [ friedman ] ) , ( [ rhosol ] ) and ( [ de1 ] ) we get @xmath49 ; e. i. , the ansatz ( [ asump1 ] ) has leads us to the case of a purely cosmological constant contribution . in general",
    ", we can always separate the contribution for `` purely '' non - relativistic matter @xmath50 @xmath51 ) from the dark energy . in this case @xmath52 , and the pressure can be written as @xmath53 we can notice that @xmath46 is exactly the non thermal pressure computed in ( [ pc ] ) ( recall that @xmath54 ) .",
    "i have to stress here that the main result derived in this section means that we have a single contribution , which satisfy the non - relativistic matter equation of state , that describe both dark matter and dark energy simultaneously , and in this way solving automatically the coincidence problem .",
    "this dark unification mechanism does not have the problem studied in @xcite , because in the cases studied in that paper , for example the chaplygin gas model @xcite , the sound velocity of the dark matter is not zero , leading to instabilities .",
    "that happens because the chaplygin gas interpolates between the equation of states for dark matter and dark energy .",
    "this does not happens here , because there is just one equation of state ; that of non - relativistic matter .",
    "as is well known from observations of supernovae , a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion occurs in the recent history of the universe . depending on what is used to model dark energy , different redshift",
    "have been obtained between @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "this topics was recently discussed in @xcite where the authors specialized in a flat cosmology , where a explicit transition can be achieved from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion . in this section",
    "we generalize this work to non flat universes , by using a model ( see equation ( [ ene ] ) ) with @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a constant parameter ( is exactly the same letter introduced in @xcite ) . in",
    "what follows , a non relativistic matter equation of state is assumed ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "introducing ( [ rate1 ] ) in ( [ ene ] ) leads to the following solution @xmath59 is evident the meaning of the subscript zero .",
    "because @xmath60 for non - relativistic matter , the friedman equation can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 . evaluating this expression for the reference time @xmath63 we obtain that @xmath64 where we have defined @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being the critical energy density . using this in ( [ req1 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath67.\\ ] ] clearly , for @xmath68 this expression reduces to the standard result . in order to compare with observations",
    ", we shall compute the deceleration parameter , @xmath69 , in terms of the redshift . by differentiating ( [ fried2 ] ) respect to cosmic time",
    "we find @xmath70}.\\ ] ] so , from ( [ fried2 ] ) we find the scale factor in term of the cosmic time , @xmath71 , and using that @xmath72 , we can use ( [ qdet ] ) to write down @xmath73 . as an example , for @xmath74 and @xmath75 the deceleration parameter computed from ( [ qdet ] ) in terms of the redshift is shown in figure 1 .",
    "+    for a fixed @xmath76 , a crossing redshift exist if @xmath77 .",
    "otherwise , the universe never made the transition .",
    "for @xmath78 , the situation is qualitatively similar , in this case with a smaller slope . in the case of a flat universe , @xmath79 we obtain @xmath80 which coincides with the result obtained in @xcite . to complete the analysis",
    ", i will briefly discuss the case of the interaction term @xmath81 , discussed also in @xcite . in this case",
    ", the deceleration parameter can be explicitly written in terms of the redshift as @xmath82 if we specialize to a flat universe , @xmath79 , @xmath83 becomes a constant , showing no transition between decelerated to an accelerated regime .",
    "however , the non flat case , is not different .",
    "actually , the @xmath84 dependence make the values of @xmath83 to vary with redshift , but there is no redshift for which @xmath85 .",
    "so the challenge would be to estimate the function @xmath86 enabling us to give the best fit to the observations .",
    "the first model considered in the last section shows us a very simple scenery to follow .",
    "let me proceed further and complicate a little bit the model setup .",
    "for example , we can study the case of a distribution of matter which is oscillatory with volume .",
    "it means that instead of consider ( [ asump1 ] ) , we use @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that matter distribution is characterized by a volume @xmath88 . in this case",
    ", the energy density behaves as @xmath89 , so when the volume considered is small enough @xmath90 , this solution approaches ( [ rhosol ] ) . a typical profile of the scale factor evolution is shown in fig .",
    "+    in this letter i have demonstrated that considering small changes in the total number of particles in our universe , offer a possible way to understand the current accelerated expansion measurements , without using any exotic energy component .",
    "also , this scenario explain also the cosmic coincidence problem , basically showing that these two components , dark matter and dark energy , are the of the same nature , but their act at different scales .",
    "this way of understand the snia observations , implies that cosmology have a new window to explore the universe considering matter creation , encoded in the function @xmath86 .",
    "although i have discussed some examples for this function , neither has been obtained from a fundamental theoretical basis .",
