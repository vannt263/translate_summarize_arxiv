    "lp  944 - 20  ( = bri 0337@xmath113535 ) is an isolated , non - accreting , brown dwarf identified through its li abundance and low luminosity @xcite .",
    "its parallactic distance and bolometric luminosity are 5.00.1 pc and 6  sec@xcite .",
    "tinney  @xcite infers an age of about @xmath12500 myr , which implies that it is a fully collapsed object ( see for a recent review of protostellar evolution ) .",
    "this requires that any observed coronal activity not be due to accretion , as may power younger brown dwarfs ( @xmath1310 myr ) in analogy with t - tauri stars .",
    "we report here on a bright 1 - 2 hour x - ray flare detected with _",
    "chandra _  during a 12 hour observation , and a strong upper limit on persistent x - ray emission .",
    "we attribute the energy release in the flare to transient magnetic activity on this fully convective , rapidly rotating star .",
    "stars with masses @xmath14 have an outer convective zone and an interior radiative region that need not be rotating at the same rate .",
    "a poloidal magnetic field in the convective layers will be stretched and amplified into strong toroidal fields when it is dragged by convective overshoot ( see ) into the radial shear in rotation that resides at the boundary ( in and near the so - called `` tachocline '' ; ) . in these cases ,",
    "rapid rotation is associated with enhanced coronal activity .",
    "the activity level correlates with the rossby number  the ratio of the stellar rotation period to the convective turnover time @xcite . for rossby numbers between 10 and 0.1 , coronal activity ( as measured by @xmath8/@xmath9 )",
    "increases with decreasing rossby number ( that is , with more rapid rotation ) , `` saturating '' at about @xmath8/@xmath9@xmath15 for rossby numbers of 0.1 to 0.01 @xcite .    for less massive stars and young brown dwarfs ,",
    "the energy is transported throughout the star by convection ; no radiative core is present .",
    "for this reason , it has been supposed that the activity and its dependence on rotation might change near the spectral type where the radiative layer disappears ( about m5.5 ; see for a physical overview ) . however , a search for this effect found no evidence for a change in the saturated value of @xmath8/@xmath9@xmath16 , down to spectral types as late as m7 , well into the region of fully convective stars @xcite .",
    "this implied no dramatic change in the rotation - activity dependence in fully convective stars .    the first hint that activity might be decreasing in the very late m dwarfs",
    "was observed from the rapidly rotating ( @xmath17 sec ) m9.5 star bri 0021 - 0214 , for which a strong upper - limit on h@xmath10  emission indicated a substantially lower persistent coronal activity than expected from a rapidly rotating , fully convective star @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "reid  @xcite observed a strong h@xmath10  flare from bri 0021 - 0214 ; this indicated that activity was indeed present , and that the star has outbursts no more than 7% of the time .",
    "liebert  @xcite reported a bright h@xmath10  flare from 2massw j0149090 + 295613 , an m9.5 v star which is otherwise quiescent .",
    "intensity variability from brown dwarfs has been searched for , with limited success .",
    "bailer - jones & mundt @xcite found no infra - red variability in three pleiades brown dwarfs , with a limit of @xmath180.05 mag on timescales between 25 min-27 hrs .",
    "a search for `` weather '' in two brown dwarfs ( lp  944 - 20  and denis - p j1228 - 1547 ) produced a claim of evidence of variability in one , at the 2.3@xmath5 level @xcite .",
    "previous x - ray observations of brown dwarfs and brown dwarf candidates have produced detections of persistent emission from several @xcite , but these are all young objects ( 10 my ) , still in the process of proto - stellar collapse , and so are actively accreting ; neither are they as cool or faint as older brown dwarfs such as lp  944 - 20 .",
    "the activity observed from these collapsing brown dwarfs is analogous to that in the also - young t - tauri stars  powered by accretion and collapse  rather than that in fully collapsed , older m dwarfs .",
    "there are only a few observations of x - ray emission in older late m dwarfs and brown dwarfs .",
    "giampapa  @xcite reported on a rosat detection from vb 8 ( spectral type m7 ) with a time - averaged @xmath8/@xmath9=1.6 .",
    "fleming  @xcite detected the m8 star vb 10 during a flare at @xmath8/@xmath9=5 .",
    "no quiescent x - ray emission was detected , limiting it to @xmath8/@xmath9@xmath19 . in the only previous observations of lp  944 - 20 ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath8/@xmath9@xmath197 was found @xcite .",
    "hence , as with h@xmath10  observations , the x - ray behavior of late m stars tends toward flaring activity and an absence of persistent activity at the x - ray detection limits of present instrumentation .",
    "our work confirms this tendency .",
    "we report here on our _ chandra _  observation of an x - ray flare from the brown dwarf lp  944 - 20 . in   [",
    "sec : obs ] , we describe the observation , analysis and detected flux level . in  3 , we interpret the light curve of the flare .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : con ] with a brief summary of our results and a comparison to other work .",
    "the observation ( _ chandra _  sequence number 200049 ) occurred on 15 dec 1999 00:05:50 - 13:03:05 utc , for 43,773 seconds . lp  944 - 20  was targeted at the nominal aimpoint for the acis - s3 chip ( backside illuminated ) in a faint imaging mode , with 3.2 sec time resolution .",
    "analysis of the acis - s3 chip countrate during the observation showed no evidence of the background flares that sometimes appear ( acis background calibration memo ) , on timescales longer than 50 sec , greater than a factor of @xmath20few ( background variability is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : var ] ) .",
    "the standard analysis data products from _",
    "chandra_found 117 x - ray objects in the field of view .",
    "we now describe how we have used the observations to measure the x - ray emission from lp  944 - 20 .",
    "the x - ray source closest to the acis - s detector aimpoint was offset from the detector aimpoint by @xmath21ra=@xmath22and @xmath21dec=@xmath118.3  according to the standard product astrometry .",
    "this offset is consistent with known systematic uncertainties in the _ chandra _  pre - processing analysis astrometry , of the version which produced the astrometry for this observation .",
    "we performed astrometry using the absolute positions of objects in usno - a2 .",
    "we used the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) v1.0 software tool _",
    "celldetect _ to find x - ray point source relative positions using counts detected in pha channels 10 - 400 ( correspondig roughly to 0.1 - 4.0 kev ) .",
    "we found 39 x - ray sources within 10of the aimpoint , with relative astrometry accurate to between 0.03 - 0.18 .",
    "we extracted all optical source positions ( from the usno - a2 catalog ) within 15  of the x - ray source positions .",
    "we did the same for 20 background fields for each x - ray source ( a total of 780 fields ) , offset by increments of 15  from each x - ray source position , to find the usno - a2 source density in the region of @xmath23 arcsec .",
    "of the 39 _ chandra _  x - ray sources , 12 had a usno - a2  object within 15 .",
    "of these 12 , seven were within 1.0  of the offset @xmath21ra=@xmath22and @xmath21dec=@xmath118.3 .",
    "the probability of n=7 ( of m=12 ) optical point sources being found within @xmath24  of a previously selected position is @xmath252 .",
    "thus , the clustered usno - a2  sources are  taken together  likely to be the optical counterparts for their corresponding x - ray sources , useful for astrometry .    to calculate the systematic shift in ra and dec",
    ", we adopted the relative positional uncertainties for the x - ray sources found by _",
    "celldetect _ , and adopted absolute positional uncertainties of 0.25  for usno - a2 sources .",
    "the astrometric correction is ( @xmath21ra=@xmath26 , @xmath21dec=8.4 ) , with an uncertainty of 0.1 .",
    "the astrometricly corrected x - ray position of the aimpoint source is then ra=03h39m35.16s , dec=@xmath1135d25h44.0s 0.1  ( 1@xmath5 ; j2000 , epoch 1999.95 ) .",
    "the positional difference between the aimpoint source and the optical position of lp  944 - 20  at this epoch @xcite is @xmath21ra=@xmath27  and @xmath21dec=0.150.23 , which is consistent at the 3@xmath5 level .",
    "the likelihood of a chance alignment of a serendipitous x - ray source within @xmath28=1  of an arbitrary position is @xmath29 , for @xmath307.2 arcsec , found from the 18 sources on the acis - s3 chip .",
    "we therefore identify this x - ray source with the brown dwarf lp  944 - 20  with 99.98% confidence on the basis of the positional coincidence .",
    "first , we estimate the background countrate .",
    "we obtained background counts from an annulus centered on the source , with inner- and outer - radius of 4 and 140 pixels .",
    "we excluded data within 10 pixels of two x - ray sources localized by _",
    "celldetect _ to be within this annulus .",
    "the total average background countrate was ( 3.990.04 ) counts secpixel ; in the limited pha channel range of 10 - 400 ( nominally 0.1 - 4.0 kev ) , the background countrate was ( 1.00.02 ) counts secpixel . for nearly all the analyses we present herein , this level of background is negligible .",
    "we extracted counts from a circle about lp  944 - 20  2.0 pixels in radius ( 0.98 the 90% enclosed energy radius at 1.5 kev , on axis ) .",
    "the total number of expected background counts in the source region is 2.270.02 counts ( 0.1 - 10.0 kev ) , and 0.570.01 counts ( 0.1 - 4.0 kev ) .",
    "we produced a ( 0.1 - 4.0 kev ) light curve of 552 sec time resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sub4varicomp ] ) . of the 19 detected counts in the source region ,",
    "15 were detected during a 2760 sec period beginning at 1999 dec 15 09:41:25 ( utc ) , which we arbitrarily define as the `` flare period '' .",
    "of these , 7 were detected in a single 552 sec bin . in 80 such time bins , with an average of 19/80=0.238 counts / bin , the probability of randomly finding 7 counts in one of 80 bins ( assuming a constant countrate ) is @xmath31 .",
    "the acis - s - bi chips suffer from short - term increases in background countrate ; these can increase the chip background countrate by up to factors of 100 across the entire chip , and in all pha channels on timescales of seconds to minutes .",
    "the ratio of the countrates during and outside the flare period in the source region is 18 - 200 ( @xmath32 range , assuming poisson statistics ) , while in the background region it is 0.85 - 1.07 ( 3@xmath5 , assuming gaussian statistics )",
    ". the flare can not be from a variation in the background and must be a change in the x - ray emission of lp  944 - 20 .",
    "there were 15 counts ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) in the 2.0 pixel ( = 0.98 ) radius about lp  944 - 20  during the 2760.0 seconds of the flare .",
    "we expect 0.14 background counts , which we neglect for this spectral analysis .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis , binning the data into two bins which contained 7 and 8 counts , with a third bin of pha channels 95 - 1024 which contained no counts .",
    "we fit the resulting spectrum with an assumed raymond - smith plasma model , implemented in xspec @xcite ; the best fit ( @xmath33=0.003 , for @xmath34=1 degree of freedom ) found @xmath35=0.26  kev(90% confidence ) , and a time - averaged flux during the 2760 seconds of ( 1.50.4 )  sec(@xmath8=[4.51.2 ]  sec ; 0.1 - 10 kev ) , which corresponds to a flux conversion factor of 1 count = 2.8  ( 0.1 - 4.0 kev ) for this spectrum .",
    "this reduced chi - square value is small because the high energy bin is essentially unimportant , as there are , in the best fit model , @xmath200 counts in this bin , and thus the model can be thought of as completely determined , with only two bins and two unknowns , although the high energy bin does provide a constraint on flatter spectra , and thus on @xmath35 and flux normalization .",
    "the uncertainty in this conversion factor depends both on the uncertainty in the raymond - smith spectral parameters , and on the uncertainty in the intrinsic spectrum . the best fit power - law spectrum ( @xmath36=2.6 ) , however , is acceptable only at 6% confidence .",
    "the best - fit black body spectrum ( kt=0.17 kev ) gives a flux 10% lower than the best - fit raymond smith spectrum .",
    "we estimate this as the level of spectral uncertainty in the flux conversion factor .    in table",
    "[ tab : flux ] , we list the @xmath8/@xmath9  values for the full observational period , pre - flare period , the flare period , and the peak 550 sec bin of the flare period .",
    "the uncertainties in these values are poisson ( counting statistics ) , plus spectral uncertainty ( @xmath2010% ) .",
    "the @xmath37 were obtained from the detected countrates , corrected for background and the enclosed energy fraction appropriate for our source region ( @xmath38 ) , and using the above flux conversion factor .",
    "the total source fluence ( including the flare ) during this observation is 5.7 ergs , corresponding to a released energy of 1.7 ergs , and a time - averaged luminosity of @xmath37=4  sec .",
    "the time - averaged @xmath8/@xmath9  is then 7 .",
    "the peak luminosity during the flare was 1.2  sec(including only the counting statistical uncertainty , not the 10% systematic uncertainty in the counts - energy conversion factor ) , corresponding to @xmath3 .    before the flaring period",
    ", there is 1 count ( 0.1 - 4 kev ) in 34535 sec , where 0.45 background counts are expected ( probability p=0.36  consistent with background ) .",
    "the 3@xmath5 upper - limit on the pre - flare flux is @xmath194.5  sec  ( @xmath71  sec ; @xmath8/@xmath9@xmath192 ) .",
    "this compares to the vb  10 quiescent coronal x - ray limits from fleming  @xcite of @xmath71.7  sec , which is an order of magnitude greater , and @xmath8/@xmath9@xmath191.0 , which is a factor of @xmath39 5 greater than we find here for lp  944 - 20 .",
    "after the flare period , there are 3 counts in 6478 sec ( 0.1 - 4 kev ) where 0.084 are expected ( p=0.0001 ) .",
    "thus , there are significant counts after the flare period , which indicates that the flare event continues beyond the flaring period we defined .",
    "due to the low number of counts , it is difficult to measure the lightcurve parameters of this flare in a model - independent way .",
    "we therefore imposed a particular model and measured the resulting parameters .",
    "we imposed a model of an instantaneous rise / exponential decay flare , set above a constant background countrate , to compare with the 0.1 - 4 kev energy band data ( 19 counts ) .",
    "we assumed the background countrate from our background region .",
    "we asserted that the instantaneous rise takes place at the time of the first detected photon in the vicinity of the flare ( 32969 seconds into the observation ) .",
    "the resulting lightcurve ( background+flare ) must produce between 11 - 27 counts in total ( 90% confidence region of the total number of counts observed ) .",
    "the distribution of counts in time should match that observed over the full observation period , using a kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite , that the data and the model be consistent at the 10% level .",
    "we tested a grid of peak countrate ( @xmath40 ) between and 1 counts  sec , in units of counts  sec , and exponential decay timescale ( @xmath41 ) between 1 and 2 in units of 100 sec .",
    "based on this model and approach , we find a 90% confidence region for @xmath41=5400700 s , and @xmath40=0.002 - 0.006 c sec .",
    "when we relax the constraint on start time , permitting the flare to begin at any time between 30 and 40 sec after observation start in grid units of 100 sec , the 90% confidence interval of @xmath41 is 500 - 7100 s , and of @xmath40 is 0.0018 - 0.054 counts  sec .",
    "this brown dwarf is known to be rapidly rotating , with a measured @xmath42 @xcite . for the reported bolometric luminosity of @xmath43  sec  @xcite and",
    "effective temperature of 2500100 k @xcite , the inferred radius is @xmath44 , which is 3510% smaller than the @xmath45 expected for an object of this mass and age @xcite .",
    "the expected radius could be derived if the temperature were lowered to 2300k and the bolometric luminosity increased to @xmath46  sec .",
    "such changes are within the observational uncertainties . presuming a radius of @xmath47 , the rotation period is @xmath48 .",
    "one might interpret the x - ray lightcurve as a localized flare that rotates out of view for a period and then re - appears .",
    "the implied rotation rate of @xmath49 1 hour does not require an especially unlikely value of @xmath50 .",
    "however , such an interpretation is by no means required by the data to explain the variations , as these are entirely consistent with the uncertainty in the flare time evolution and poisson counting statistics .",
    "we have detected an x - ray source which we identify with the brown dwarf lp  944 - 20 , with 99.98% confidence , based on positional coincidence .",
    "the detection was during a flare , with a peak x - ray luminosity of @xmath511  sec , or @xmath52 .",
    "this flare s peak luminosity is a factor of ten below that of an x - ray flare detected from the comparably luminous m8 star vb  10 ( @xmath53 ; ) . in vb  10 ,",
    "the peak x - ray luminosity exceeded @xmath54 .",
    "we have analysed the x - ray light curve with a simple sharp rise plus exponential decay model ; this indicates a decay time @xmath55 when we specify the flare start - time , and in the range of 500 - 7100 s when we do not specify the flare start time .",
    "this implies lp  944 - 20  is flaring @xmath2010% of the time , comparable to the amount of h@xmath10  flaring among the coolest m dwarfs @xcite , although the uncertainty on our value is large .",
    "the light - curve is consistent with rotational modulation , but the counting statistics are too poor to conclude that it is required , and discovery of such modulation must wait for higher signal - to - noise data . a previous attempt to detect this source in x - rays @xcite placed an upper - limit on the time - averaged luminosity ( @xmath56 ) during a 66 ksec _",
    "rosat_/pspc observation and a 220 ksec _ rosat_/hri observation .",
    "these limits are above the time - averaged luminosity we detect here ( @xmath57 ) , and are therefore consistent with our results .",
    "x - ray variability was not discussed by these previous works ; however , a cursory review of 220  ksec of rosat / hri data revealed no variability on timescales of 500 sec ; the detection sensitivity ( 5 counts in a 500 sec bin , energy conversion factor of 3.2  sec  count ) , is about a factor of 10 above the present peak - flare detection .",
    "the time - averaged luminosity ( @xmath37=4  sec ) is a factor of @xmath58 below the previous detections of brown dwarfs and brown dwarf candidates ; the time - averaged ratio @xmath8/@xmath9(=7 ) is factor of @xmath59 below this ratio @xcite .",
    "this might be due to different energy production mechanisms ; the previously detected brown dwarfs are young compared with lp  944 - 20  ( @xmath201 my vs. 500 my ) and are still forming , while lp  944 - 20  is isolated and undergoing slow gravitational contraction .",
    "the persistent x - ray emission of the very young brown - dwarfs in open clusters is more analogous to the pre - main sequence t - tauri stars  where convection is stronger , the atmospheres are less neutral , and accretion may play a role  while the flaring x - ray emission of lp  944 - 20  is more analogous to the flaring emission of late - type main - sequence stars , such as vb  8 and vb  10 .",
    "we estimate ( order of magnitude ) an eddy turnover time of @xmath201 year for lp  944 - 20 , yielding a rossby number of @xmath605 .",
    "as discussed earlier , this is below the rossby number limit at which the x - rays are observed to be `` saturated '' ( at @xmath8/@xmath9@xmath20 ) .",
    "that saturation level is much greater than our quiescent x - ray flux upper limit .",
    "either the `` supersaturation '' suggested by randich has strongly set in , or the connection between rossby number and observed activity is no longer relevant .",
    "it is possible that the rapid rotation suppresses persistent coronal activity , either by forcing the magnetic field into a more organized form or by suppressing the turbulent dynamo .",
    "it is also possible that the neutrality of a cool photosphere quenches coupling between atmospheric motions and the magnetic field , which forces the field into dissipative configurations ( as pointed out by ) . in any case",
    ", the detected flare requires that a magnetic field be present on lp 944 - 20 , and that at least occasionally it is forced into a dissipative configuration high in the atmosphere .",
    "our results confirm the impression from previous studies of h@xmath10that stellar activity is dying at the bottom of the main sequence , at least in the form that it has in more massive late - type stars .",
    "we have pushed the limits on quiescent coronal emission levels to new lows for fully convective objects .",
    "we have also helped confirm that such objects do apparently still have magnetic fields and an ability to flare about 10% of the time .",
    "the authors are grateful to the _ chandra _  observatory team for producing this exquisite observatory .",
    "we are grateful to andrew cumming for his critical reading of an early version of this paper , and to the referee tom fleming , for comments which dramatically improved the paper s readability .",
