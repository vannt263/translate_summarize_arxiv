    "the broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is exceptionally complete in coverage and unique amongst all astronomical objects observed and studied .",
    "the historical lightcurve of the supernova explosion of 1054 a.d . is not conclusive with respect to the type of progenitor star and leaves many questions concerning the stellar evolution of the progenitor star unanswered @xcite . at the present date ,",
    "the observed remnant is of a plerionic type with a bright continuum emission and filamentary structures emitting mainly in lines in the near infrared and optical range .",
    "the remaining compact central object is a pulsar with a period of 33  ms and a spin - down luminosity of ( @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "the emitted power of the continuum peaks in the hard uv/ soft x - ray at @xmath7  erg  s@xmath6 ( assuming a distance of 2  kpc ) . given the kinetic energy of the spinning pulsar as the only available source of energy in the system , the spin - down luminosity is efficiently converted into radiation .",
    "there is no evidence for accretion onto the compact object as an alternative mechanism to feed energy into the system @xcite .",
    "the emission of the crab nebula is predominantly produced by nonthermal processes ( mainly synchrotron and inverse compton ) which form a continuum emission covering the range from radio to very - high energy gamma - rays .",
    "the synchrotron origin of the optical and radio continuum emission was proposed by @xcite and experimentally identified by polarization measurements @xcite .",
    "the general features of the observed sed are characterised by 3 breaks connecting 4 power - law type spectra .",
    "the breaks occur in the near infrared , near uv , and hard x - ray .",
    "the break frequencies are inferred indirectly because they occur in spectral bands which are difficult to observe .",
    "the high energy part of the synchrotron spectrum cuts off at a few mev .",
    "this energy is very close to the theoretical limit for synchrotron emission derived from classical electrodynamics to be @xmath8  mev ( independent of the magnetic field ) with @xmath9 depending on the broad - band spectrum of the emitting electrons @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the crab accelerates particles close to the possible limit .",
    "the synchrotron origin of multi - mev photons requires the presence of electrons up to pev energies .",
    "these pev electrons inevitably radiate via inverse compton scattering at photon energies up to and beyond 50  tev with detectable fluxes @xcite .",
    "another independent indication for a common origin of mev and 50 - 100  tev photons is possibly correlated variability of the nebula emission in these two energy bands which has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the inverse compton emission , other additional mechanisms might contribute to the vhe luminosity : photons from @xmath10 decay from ions responsible for the acceleration of positrons at the termination shock @xcite and bulk comptonization of the relativistic wind @xcite .",
    "the origin of the emitting particles is commonly assumed to be the pulsar which efficiently accelerates a relativistic wind of particles ( electrons / positrons and ions ) in the proximity of the magnetosphere with a luminosity close to its spin - down luminosity .",
    "the relativistic wind terminates in a standing reverse shock which is commonly associated with a ring like feature identified at a distance of @xmath11  cm or 14@xmath12 by recent x - ray observations @xcite . at the position of the termination shock ,",
    "the flow is dominated by kinetic energy .",
    "the orientation of the toroidal magnetic field is transverse to the flow direction and parallel to the shock surface @xcite .",
    "this shock geometry is not in favor of efficient acceleration of particles in shock drift or diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "two possible alternative acceleration mechanisms have been discussed in detail in the literature :    a possible mechanism to accelerate particles in the relativistic wind is the dissipation of magnetic energy via reconnection of current sheets in the striped pulsar wind @xcite , which was recently revisited by @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was found to be close to the requirement to convert sufficiently fast the initially poynting flux dominated flow .",
    "however , it requires a rather high pair injection rate of @xmath13  s@xmath6 and subsequently a small bulk lorentz factor of the flow of @xmath14 .",
    "an alternative process to efficiently accelerate particles at the shock suggested by @xcite invokes resonant scattering of positrons by cyclotron waves induced by the ions in the downstream region .",
    "numerical particle - in - cell simulations @xcite show that this mechanism produces a power - law type spectrum .",
    "the ions are expected to produce gamma - rays after interacting with the matter in the nebula and produce signatures in the observed gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "independent of the actual acceleration mechanism , the injected nonthermal particle distribution in the nebula expands and cools adiabatically @xcite in a subsonic flow until it terminates at the envelope of the nebula . in the framework of the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) flow model of @xcite , basic constraints on the bulk lorentz factor of the wind and the pulsar s",
    "luminosity have been derived .",
    "it is noteworthy that in these models the radio emission is not explained and an ad hoc assumption about an extra population of radio emitting particles is required @xcite .",
    "furthermore , assuming that the mhd approximation holds , the downstream particle distribution , flow velocity , and magnetic field strength can be derived .",
    "overall , the predicted synchrotron emission and its angular dimension in this model are in good agreement with observations @xcite",
    ".    the morphology of the nebula is resolved at most wavelengths .",
    "it is characterized by a complex structure and shows a general decrease of the size of the emission region with increasing energy .",
    "this is consistent with the decrease of the lifetime of electrons injected into the nebula with increasing energies .",
    "however , there are indications that at mm - wavelengths , a compact , possibly non - thermal emission region is present that does not follow the general behaviour .",
    "the central region close to the torus - like structure is also known to exhibit temporal variability at radio @xcite , optical @xcite , and x - ray frequencies @xcite .",
    "the morphology of these moving structures first seen in optical observations has lead to the commonly used term `` wisps '' @xcite which are possibly ( for a discussion see also hester et al",
    ". , 1995 ) explained by ions penetrating downstream of the standing shock and accelerating positrons and electrons via cyclotron resonance @xcite . whereas at radio wavelengths the measured spectrum is spatially constant over the entire nebula , at higher frequencies , a general softening of the spectrum from the central region to the outer edge of the nebula is observed .",
    "this tendency is also explainable with the short life time of the more energetic electrons .",
    "recent high resolution spectral imaging at x - ray energies have revealed a _",
    "hardening _ of the spectrum in the torus region well beyond the bright ring - like structure that is usually identified with the standing relativistic shock @xcite .",
    "the spectral hardening at the torus could be indicative for ongoing acceleration far from the pulsar . in this case",
    ", the predictions for the size of the tev emission region based upon injection of electrons at the supposed standing reverse shock wave at 14  projected distance are very likely underestimating the true size .",
    "the torus is located at @xmath15  projected distance to the pulsar .",
    "additional components as e.g. photons from @xmath10 decay are expected to have roughly the same angular size as the radio nebula ( @xmath16 ) which is resolvable with stereoscopic ground based cherenkov telescopes . besides the nebula discussed above",
    ", the _ pulsar _ is a prominent source of pulsed radiation up to gev energies . the characteristic bimodal pulse shape is retained over all wavelengths with variations of the relative brightness of the two main components .",
    "the pulsar has not been detected at energies beyond 10  gev .",
    "polar cap @xcite and outer gap @xcite models have been successful at explaining the general features of the pulsed emission as curvature radiation of an energetic electron / positron plasma .",
    "the emission at tev energies strongly depends on the location of the emission region . generally , within polar cap models",
    "the optical depth for tev photons is very large because of magnetic pair production processes .",
    "effectively , the polar cap region is completely opaque to tev emission . within outer gap models , inverse compton scattered photons could be visible even at tev energies .",
    "again , the optical depth depends on the position of the outer gap in the magnetosphere . in any case ,",
    "strong variation of the optical depth with energy results in rather narrow features in energy for a possible signal in a @xmath17 diagram .",
    "this motivates a dedicated analysis searching for signals in narrow differential energy bins .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : after a description of the instrument ( section  [ section : experiment ] ) and data analyses ( section  [ section : data ] ) , results on the energy spectrum , morphology , and pulsed emission ( section  [ section : phase_result ] ) are given in section 4 . section  [ section : model ] describes model calculations of the inverse compton emission and compares the prediction with the measured energy spectrum.the average magnetic field in the emission region is derived , upper limits on the presence of ions in the wind are calculated , and additional components are discussed .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusion are given ( section  [ section : summary ] ) .",
    "observations were carried out with the hegra ( high energy gamma ray astronomy ) stereoscopic system of five imaging air cherenkov telescopes located on the roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma at an altitude of 2,200  m above sea level . the system consisted of optical telescopes each equipped with a 8.5  m@xmath18 tessellated mirror surface arranged in a davies - cotton design .",
    "the horizontal ( altitude / azimuth ) mounts of the telescopes were computer controlled and could track objects in celestial coordinates with an accuracy of better than 25@xcite .",
    "the telescopes were arranged on the corners of a square with a side length of 100  m with a fifth telescope positioned in the center .",
    "the individual mirror dishes collected cherenkov light generated by charged particles from air showers in the atmosphere which produces an image of the short ( a few nsec duration ) light pulse in the focal plane .",
    "the primary focus was equipped with an ultra - fast array of 271 photo - multiplier tubes ( pmt ) arranged in a hexagonal shape at 0.25@xmath19 spacing .",
    "the light collection area of the pmts was enhanced by funnels installed in front of the photo - cathode .",
    "the camera covered a field of view with a full opening angle of 4.1@xmath19 in the sky suitable for surveys .",
    "the feasibility of survey type observations is demonstrated by the first serendipitous discovery of an unidentified object with this instrument named tev  j2035 + 4130 .",
    "the imaging air cherenkov technique initially explored with single telescopes is improved by adding stereoscopic information to the event reconstruction .",
    "this was pioneered by the hegra group ( see @xcite and below ) .",
    "the stereoscopic observation improves the sensitivity by reducing background and achieving a low energy threshold with a comparably small mirror surface by efficiently rejecting local muon background events .",
    "an important benefit of the stereoscopy is also the redundancy of multiple images allowing to control efficiently systematic uncertainties .",
    "additionally , the reconstruction of the energy and the direction of the shower is substantially improved with respect to single - telescope imaging @xcite . moreover , the probability of night sky background triggers in two telescopes in coincidence is strongly reduced .",
    "the trigger condition for the telescope requires two adjacent pixels exceeding 6 photo electrons ( p.e . ) within an effective gate time of 14  nsec .",
    "further details on the telescope hardware are given in @xcite , a description of the trigger and read - out electronics can be found in @xcite .",
    "the telescope system with 4 ( from 1998 onwards 5 ) telescopes was operational between spring 1997 and fall 2002 .",
    "observations are taken in a `` wobble '' observation mode , in which the telescopes point at a position shifted by 0.5@xmath19 in declination to the position of the crab pulsar .",
    "the sign of the shift is alternated every 20  min .",
    "all telescopes are aligned at the same celestial position and track the object during its transit in the sky .",
    "the wobble observation mode efficiently increases the available observation time while decreasing systematic differences seen between dedicated on- and off - source observations .",
    "the background for point - like sources is estimated by using 5 off - source positions with a similar acceptance as for the on - source observations .    in the observational season 1998/1999 , dedicated observations at larger zenith angles ( z.a .",
    "distance @xmath20 ) were performed in order to increase the collection area for high energy events ( typically above 10  tev ) .",
    "all observations have been carried out under favorable conditions with clear skies , low wind speeds ( @xmath21  m  @xmath22 ) , and a relative humidity below 100  % .",
    "the overall relative operation efficiency of the hegra system of cherenkov telescopes reached 85  % of the total available darkness time such that 5,500 hours of data on more than 100 objects and various scans were collected in 67 months of operation .",
    "la palma can be considered an excellent site for cherenkov light observations and moreover the hegra system of cherenkov telescopes was functioning very smoothly and reliably .",
    "the entire data - set collected by the hegra system of telescopes has been used to search for serendipitous sources in the field of view @xcite .",
    "dedicated test observations of the crab nebula with a topological trigger , reduced energy threshold , and convergent pointing mode are reported elsewhere @xcite .      throughout the time of operation",
    ", the data acquisition @xcite and electronics setup of the readout of the cameras and central triggering have remained unchanged . as a consequence of the upgrade from 4 to 5 telescopes in 1998 and occasional technical problems , the number of operational telescopes varies from 3 ( 5.5  % of the total operational time ) to 4 ( 38  % ) and 5 instruments ( 56  % ) .",
    "runs with less than 3 operational telescopes are not considered here ( 0.5  % ) .",
    "the selection of data aims at efficiently accepting good weather conditions with minimal changes in the atmosphere ( mainly due to variations of the aerosol distribution ) .",
    "the selection is based upon the following approach : under the assumption that the cosmic ray flux at the top of the atmosphere remains intrinsically constant and that the bulk of triggered events are cosmic ray events , changes in the acceptance of the detector ( mainly variations of the transparency of the atmosphere ) should be easily seen in variations of the trigger rate . for individual data - runs ( 20 minutes duration )",
    "an expectation of the rate is calculated based upon ( a ) the long - term average rate determined for every month @xcite , ( b ) the change of rate with altitude @xmath23 : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , for @xmath26 : @xmath27 , and ( c ) a scaling according to the number of operational telescopes ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "runs with an average rate deviating by more than 25  % from the expectation are rejected ( 15  % of all runs available ) .    in table  [ table : data_selection ] ,",
    "observational data are summarized for the individual ( yearly ) observational periods and for 3 intervals of zenith angle .",
    "the total amount of data accepted sums up to 384.86  hrs of which 20  % were taken at large zenith angles .",
    "the long - term calibration of data and a deep understanding of the variations of detector performance over an extended period of time is essential for deriving a combined energy spectrum .",
    "the calibration methods used in this analysis are based upon @xcite with an additional relative inter - telescope calibration @xcite .",

    "@xmath34    the variation of the efficiency @xmath32 is mainly caused by the ageing of mirrors and to some smaller extent by ageing of the light funnels installed in front of the photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) resulting in a loss of reflectivity at a steady rate of @xmath35  % points per year .",
    "the variation of @xmath31 is caused by ageing of pmts ( rate of loss @xmath36  % points per year ) , and occasional ( typically twice per year ) changes of high voltage settings to compensate for the losses of efficiency .",
    "the two different efficiencies ( @xmath37 ) are disentangled by calibrating the electronics gain via special calibration events taken with a laser and studying the variation of the event rate for cosmic rays .    for the calibration of the electronics , a pulsed nitrogen laser mimics cherenkov light flashes and",

    "the light is isotropized by a plastic scintillator material in the center of the dish and illuminates the camera directly .",
    "the conversion factors relating the recorded digitized pulse - height to the number of photo electrons detected in the pmts are derived from the relative fluctuations in the recorded amplitudes for these laser - generated calibration events .",
    "finally , the efficiency of the optical system ( mirrors and funnels ) is calculated indirectly : the laser calibration events are used to calculate an average electronics gain @xmath31 for individual periods . by comparing the average cosmic ray event rate with the expected value , an optical efficiency @xmath32 is calculated .",

    "given the age of the nebula of 954 years , the synchrotron - cooled spectrum is close to a power - law with @xmath157 reaching to @xmath158 .",
    "the resulting synchrotron emission is not in conflict with the available data unless the power in the extra maxwellian type injection spectrum becomes a sizable fraction ( @xmath159 ) of the total power of the electrons responsible for the broad - band sed .",
    "however , after calculating the inverse compton emission of this extra component and comparing it with the gamma - ray data , an upper limit at 99  % c.l . can be set @xmath160 ruling out the existence of unnoticed ( unobserved ) electron populations with @xmath161 in the nebula the possible existence of an additional synchrotron emitting component possibly associated with a spectral hardening in the mev energy range as observed consistently by the comptel instrument , batse @xcite , and integral and has been discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the contribution of such an additional component to the observed tev flux is probably small and is relevant only at energies exceeding a few 100 tev .",
    "the hegra stereoscopic system of air cherenkov telescopes performed extensive observation of the crab supernova remnant .",
    "the energy spectrum has been determined over more than 2 decades in energy and 5 decades in flux .",
    "the main points of the data analyses are to constrain the acceleration of electron / positron pair plasma in the vicinity of the termination shock of the pulsar wind in the surrounding medium .",
    "the high energy data presented here give a unique view on the extreme accelerator which resides in the crab nebula .",
    "the energy spectrum of the unpulsed component is very likely produced by the same electrons that produce the broad - band emission spectrum extending from soft to hard x - rays and finally reach the soft gamma - rays ( with a cut - off at a few mev ) .",
    "the electrons up - scatter mainly photons of the synchrotron nebula , the soft thermal photons seen as the far infrared excess , the universal cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and possibly mm - radiation emitted in a rather compact region .",
    "the comparison of the flux level at tev energies combined with the synchrotron flux in a simple spherical model , constrains directly the magnetic field in the emission region of the nebula to be at the level of 160  @xmath92 g .",
    "the agreement of the measured broad band energy spectrum ranging from soft x - rays up to 100  tev with the prediction based upon a simple model of an electron population being injected at the standing reverse shock strengthens the claim that electrons with energies exceeding @xmath162  ev are continuously accelerated .",
    "limited by the photon statistics detected at high energies ( @xmath163  tev ) , expected variations in the acceleration / cooling rate on time scales of months for these electrons can not be established with the current instrumentation .",
    "the data show evidence for the predicted gradual softening of the energy spectrum . below roughly 200  gev",
    "the spectrum is expected to harden quickly .",
    "future detectors with a sufficiently low energy threshold will be able to see this feature .",
    "however , the expected _ softening _ occurs rapidly at energies beyond 70  tev . here ,",
    "low elevation observations with the cherenkov telescopes from the southern hemisphere will be very helpful . given the good agreement of the predicted inverse compton spectrum with the measurement , the presence of ions in the wind is either negligible or radiative losses are exceedingly small .",
    "independent of the spectrum , the morphology of the emission region could reveal signatures of the presence of ions in the wind and the nebula . experimental upper limits given here constrain the size of the emission region at the considered energies to be less than 2  and less than 3  above 10  tev .",
    "this excludes for example a strong contribution from the outer shock of the ( undetected ) expanding super nova remnant and constrains the transport of ions in the wind .",
    "finally , pulsed emission from inside the pulsar s magnetosphere at high energies is expected in outer gap models .",
    "a dedicated search for narrow features as predicted in this type of model has been performed and in the absence of a signal , upper limits have been calculated .",
    "the upper limits reach well below the more optimistic predictions of @xcite but more recent calculations indicate that the pair opacity in the emission region is possibly larger than originally anticipated . in a different scenario ,",
    "pulsed emission is expected to arise as a consequence of inverse compton scattering of pulsed soft photons by the un - shocked wind @xcite .",
    "the upper limits derived here are useful in constraining combinations of the bulk lorentz factor and the distance of wind injection to the pulsar . for a range of bulk lorentz factors from @xmath164 the distance of the wind",
    "is constrained to be accelerated more than 50 light radii away from the pulsar .",
    "future observations of the nebula with low energy threshold instruments ( magic , glast ) and large collection area observations at small elevations from the southern hemisphere ( cangaroo iii , h.e.s.s . )",
    "should extend the accessible energy range below 100  gev ( magic ) and beyond 100  tev ( cangaroo iii , h.e.s.s . ) where the spectral shape is expected to deviate strongly from a power - law with @xmath165 . with low energy threshold cherenkov telescopes like magic",
    "the detection of pulsed emission from the pulsar becomes feasible .",
    "combining information about possible variability of the nebula s emission at different wavelengths ( specifically hard x - rays and say 20 - 100 tev emission ) would ultimately prove the common ( electronic ) origin of the observed emission .",
    "fortunately , the crab will be frequently observed as a calibration source by all cherenkov telescopes and by integral and other future hard x - ray missions so that even without dedicated observations , substantial observation time will be accumulated .",
    "a dedicated mm - observation with sub - arcsecond resolution of the region of the nebula within the x - ray torus would be of great interest in order to confirm the predicted existence of multi - layered shocks which could be responsible for the mm - emission detected with the moderate ( @xmath166 10 ) resolution observations currently available .",
    "if the injection of mm - emitting electrons in a compact region is confirmed , inverse compton scattered emission produced by the same low energy electrons could in principle explain the discrepancy of the model with the energy spectrum observed by the egret spark - chamber onboard the cgro satellite .",
    "again , future observations with the glast satellite with improved statistics will be of great interest to study the actual shape of the energy spectrum above a few gev .    the support of the german ministry for research and technology ( bmbf ) and of the spanish research council ( cicyt ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
