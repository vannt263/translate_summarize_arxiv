    "the early phases of star formation occur in the densest and coldest regions within molecular clouds , i.e.  dense cold cores .",
    "detailed studies of nearby star - forming molecular clouds have led to a conception of the evolution of individual low - mass stars from prestellar cores to pre - main - sequence stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of high - mass stars ( m @xmath6m@xmath0 ) is less understood , in particular its earliest stages and the link to the origin of associations and clusters .",
    "previous studies , mostly aimed towards luminous infrared sources , have provided evidence for collimated outflows and large - scale rotating structures around forming high - mass objects ( * ? ? ? * and ref .  therein ) .",
    "this indicates that they also grow via accretion through a disk and that the high radiation pressure could be released in outflow cavities @xcite . in the low - mass regime ,",
    "accretion rates are found to be of the order 10@xmath7m@xmath0yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "much higher values of 10@xmath8m@xmath0yr@xmath3 are expected during the build - up of high - mass stars @xcite and corresponding increased outflow energetics have been observed .",
    "recently , simulations of protostars accreting at such high rates predicted a bloating by several tens of solar radii or more and the accompanying high luminosity at low surface temperature before they reach the main sequence @xcite .",
    "this gives further indication that the formation process differs from a scaled - up version of the low - mass case .",
    "it is presumed that the onset of high - mass star formation occurs in cores ( diameters of 0.1pc and less ) within massive cold clumps ( diameters of around 0.5pc ) .",
    "surveys in the far - infrared and at millimetre wavelengths are well suited to search for such objects , but so far the earliest , i.e.  prestellar , stages have eluded discovery .",
    "derive statistical lifetimes of less than 10@xmath9yr for the former , and of 10@xmath4yr for massive dense cores that are forming stars but exhibit low infrared emission .",
    "interferometric observations provide the essential spatial resolution to study the substructure of clumps , and to infer the properties of embedded cores further requires a good coverage of their spectral energy distribution . in this work",
    "we present such a detailed study of one clump .",
    "in particular , we investigate the amount of fragments in the clump and their properties , the arising outflow activity , and the indications for collapse .",
    "the clump is located in the region that has been identified using the isophot serendipity survey ( isoss , ) at 170@xmath1 to establish far - infrared colour temperatures . @xcite and",
    "@xcite selected sources containing a large fraction of cold dust , and subsequent studies revealed a population of cold clumps and a collapsing massive core .",

    "a lower mass limit m @xmath15m@xmath0 was found for the central region ( @xmath121pc@xmath13 ) , while the far - infrared and submillimetre measurements give a luminosity l @xmath16l@xmath0 , an average dust temperature of about 15k and a mass of @xmath17m@xmath0 .",
    "this region contains two clumps detected in the submillimetre continuum named smm1 and smm2 that are separated by about @xmath18 along the east - west direction .",
    "the smm1 clump is subject of this publication .",
    "its effective radius is about 0.2pc , and from the thermal emission a characteristic dust temperature of @xmath19k and a clump mass of m@xmath20m@xmath0 were found .",
    "the molecular line observations reported in @xcite show red - shifted self - absorption that is interpreted as signature of collapse motions .",
    "furthermore , at least one outflow is present .",
    "the outflow properties resulting from the single - dish observations , i.e.  the outflow mass of about 18m@xmath0 and the mass outflow rate of 10@xmath8m@xmath0yr@xmath3 , are comparable to values derived for outflows from presumed high - mass star precursors .",
    "these results render the smm1 clump a promising object to study the early phases of collapse and fragmentation occurring in massive cold cores .    the detailed study of this source we present here made use of recently collected infrared and ( sub-)millimetre data described in the next section .",
    "they reveal two star - forming cores and molecular outflows ( section  3 ) . in section  4",

[ fig : h2map ] we show the near - infrared h@xmath40=1 - 0 s(1 ) ( @xmath232.122@xmath1 ) line emission map .",
    "this map has been derived by subtracting the scaled k band image from the narrow - band image so that stars cancelled out . stars that were not properly subtracted have been masked afterwards for clarity .",
    "as shown in the inlay of fig .",
    "[ fig : h2map ] , towards the blue and red lobes of the molecular outflow driven by smm1 south there is patchy near - infrared h@xmath21 emission .",
    "such features trace protostellar jets , and the emission probably arises from collisionally excited h@xmath21 in shocked gas .",
    "this is supported by faint filamentary emission in the 4.5 and 5.8@xmath1 bands we detected lateral to smm1 south along north - east - to - south - west and in the vicinity of smm1 north ( yellowish features in fig .",

    "there is extended emission overlapping with the smm1 south position , where the flux is about 1.2mjy . at 8@xmath1",
    "no counterparts corresponding to smm1 north or south are detected .",
    "the source towards smm1 south clearly dominates the emission at 24 and 70@xmath1 . due to the separation of about 9@xmath27 between smm1 north and south ,",
    "the derivation of fluxes at these wavelengths is impaired towards smm1 north ( psf fwhm of about 6@xmath27 and 17@xmath27 ) .",
    "we accomplished psf subtraction to remove the emission of smm1 south .",
    "at both 24 and 70@xmath1 the residual maps do not reveal a second compact source at smm1 north .",
    "the 3@xmath28 upper limits for smm1 north were derived from the residual scatter at its position .",
    "we ended up with 24@xmath1 fluxes of 199mjy and 15.7jy for smm1 south and upper flux limits of 5.3mjy and 177mjy for smm1 north at 24 and 70@xmath1 respectively .",

    "the total fluxes we derived are higher than those given in @xcite because we allowed for a larger extent of the background component . as in the 850@xmath1 map ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4map ] ) , smm1 north and south blend into a single elongated maximum in the single - dish 1.2 mm map .",
    "therefore we extracted fluxes in the same way for both sources , using the positions from the submillimetre and allowing for a pointing offset .",

    "as indicated in the plot , the positions of the peaks are consistent with a systemic velocity v@xmath83kms@xmath3 . the observed line ratios ( neglecting the noise ) depart from the expected optically thin lte ratios : f@xmath32/f@xmath84 and f@xmath30/f@xmath85 compared to 0.2 and 0.6 in the lte case .",
    "such hyperfine `` anomalies '' have also been observed towards star - forming clouds in the past @xcite .",
    "have investigated this numerically and found that the velocity structure in the emitting cloud core could strongly affect the line ratios .",
    "in particular , they found that an increased f@xmath30/f@xmath31 ratio indicates inward motion in the core .",
    "line ratios similar to the smm1 north spectrum were predicted for a subset of their models .    in the case of smm1 south the hcn(1 - 0 ) spectrum is detected with a higher signal - to - noise ratio of up to 40 . by fitting the line wings with a symmetric profile , we get v@xmath86kms@xmath3 .",
    "the hyperfine components are characterised by complex line shapes and can not be described within the optically thin lte approximation .",
    "the main features of the line profiles are strong dips near the line centres .",
    "in essence , such dips can be interpreted : 1 ) as an artifact of the data combination , i.e.  the short - spacing flux is not recovered when combining the interferometric and single - dish data ; 2 ) as a physical effect , namely , as a result of the self - absorption of the internal radiation in the envelope . to illustrate that this is not an artifact of data reduction we show the single - dish and interferometric hcn(1 - 0 ) spectra ( integrated over @xmath87 ) before their combination in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdbihcn ] .",
    "if the dips in the interferometric spectrum are a result of the missing short - spacing flux , then we should see prominent emission near the line centres in the single - dish data . however , both interferometric and single - dish spectra have strong dips that indicate that these line features are real .",
    "our observations reveal two major fragments towards the smm1 clump . from its mean fwhm extent of 30000au @xcite",
    "we calculate a volume - averaged density of n@xmath88cm@xmath8 for smm1 .",
    "the dust temperature of 16.5k gives a jeans length of about 17000au and a jeans mass of 0.7m@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the two cores with masses more than one magnitude higher are not the direct result of thermal fragmentation , because one would then expect a number of cores with about one jeans mass to form .",
    "the projected distance of the two cores is 21000au .",
    "it is rather large compared to the radius of influence of radiative feedback from protostellar objects .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that the latter is around 1000au in the first 20000yr of core collapse .",
    "this suggests that the two cores evolve individually in terms of radiative feedback , however a kinematic influence is not excluded .",
    "@xcite proposed a lower column density threshold of 1g@xmath62 ( n@xmath89@xmath62 ) for the formation of high - mass stars .",
    "for the smm1 clump , we derived a peak column density of @xmath90@xmath62 from the single - dish 1.2 mm map peak flux .",
    "it does not reach the proposed limit . however , the core peak column densities lie beyond the threshold ( see table  [ tab : corepars ] ) .",
    "this shows that observations with high spatial resolution are required to evaluate the core properties .",
    "the two detected cores smm1 north and south appear quite similar at long wavelengths because they are of nearly the same size and exhibit comparable continuum emission . however , the derived core masses depend crucially on the assigned dust temperatures , and these are determined by the flux levels in the far - infrared . at wavelengths below @xmath12100@xmath1 the smm1 clump of about 75m@xmath0 is expected to become optically thick for continuum emission , and our planck component fit does not take this into account .",
    "we therefore neglect the fitted warm component for smm1 south in the rest of the discussion . also for the cold components",
    ", we may have underestimated the characteristic dust temperature . however , because of its mass the far - infrared continuum optical depth of smm1 is expected to be of the order of unity only .",
    "this means that a significantly higher dust temperature , corresponding to a lower mass and in consequence to a lower optical depth , would not be consistent with the far - infrared fluxes .",
    "thus , the resulting uncertainty of the masses are about a factor of two , but the general averaging along the line - of - sight could introduce larger errors . furthermore , our mass derivation relies on the used dust opacities . while our choice of the oh5 model is rather conservative and the results can be compared to other studies , the true opacities may well differ . in the following , we take the derived masses at face value .",
    "both smm1 north and south are compact and appear to drive individual outflows .",
    "therefore we suspect them to form individual stars or stellar systems of a few . with about 10 and 15m@xmath0 , smm1 south and north represent cores of intermediate mass . from the comparison of core and stellar mass distributions ,",
    "there are tentative indications that the star - forming efficiency on the scales of individual cores is between 25 and 50% ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and ref .",
    "therein ) . under this assumption , one would expect both cores to form intermediate - mass protostars or protostellar systems in case none of the surrounding matter enters in the core collapse .",
    "however , the latter is probable because of the large - scale collapse motions that have been observed towards smm1 . in comparison to samples of low - mass dense cores , smm1 north and south are denser by a factor of 10 .",
    "we regard the peak column density values we derived from the interferometric 1.3 mm peak fluxes as lower limits because of the filtering in the interferometric map . for low - mass dense cores ,",
    "peak column densities of @xmath91@xmath62 or lower were reported @xcite , so both cores lie above .",
    "they rather resemble the objects found in irdcs by @xcite .",
    "while their sample of four clumps ( we use a different nomenclature here ) have masses of 100m@xmath0 and greater , the small scale cores are several thousand au in size and their masses are 2 to 21m@xmath0 with the exception of one hot molecular core candidate . as in the case of smm1 south , 24@xmath1 sources are associated with those cores .",
    "similar findings have been reported by @xcite for the more massive core in irdc 18223 - 3 , in particular the remarkable low luminosity .",
    "the sed of smm1 south at wavelengths below about 80@xmath1 ( fig .",

    "warm and hot dust components are required to explain the emission down to 24@xmath1 , and also emission from very small grains may contribute in this wavelength regime .",
    "the fact that smm1 south appears as point source at 24 and 70@xmath1 shows that this core contains a compact region of heated dust . assuming half of the psf fwhm ( 6@xmath27 at 24@xmath1 ) as an upper limit",
    ", the emitting region has a size of less than 7000au .",
    "this is consistent with an embedded young stellar precursor that constitutes the driving source of the smm1 south outflow .",
    "smm1 north lacks emission in the infrared .",
    "the only sign of star formation is the smm1 north outflow , indicating that this core is also further evolved than a supposed prestellar stage .",
    "the characteristic dust temperature is constrained to an upper limit , and therefore in this case the derived core mass represents only a lower limit .    regarding the motion of the two cores with respect to each other ,",
    "their systemic velocities derived from the hcn spectra differ by about 1.3kms@xmath3 and smm1 north appears to be receding . the estimated uncertainty is 0.5kms@xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , the value is relatively high compared to the velocity dispersions of up to 0.5kms@xmath3 measured for the core - to - core motions e.g.  in ngc  1333 and perseus @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to roughly 0.3auyr@xmath3 , and on a timescale of about 10@xmath92yr the cores would cover their projected distance .",
    "the seds of both cores are dominated by the emission at long wavelengths arising from cold dust .",
    "this emission does not disclose much information about the internal structure of the cores .",
    "the lack of mid - infrared emission and the low spatial resolution in the far - infrared , when compared to the expected scales of emitting regions , do also prevent clarification of the properties of the embedded source in the case of smm1 south .",
    "smm1 north is very likely less evolved , but we can not exclude projection effects .",
    "more observations are needed to further constrain the star formation process in the detected cores .",
    "the core emission morphology in the far - infrared will be explored with the esa herschel mission . in the case of smm1 south ,",
    "high spatial resolution imaging beyond 20@xmath1 combined with high sensitivity , possible with the miri instrument on jwst , will severely constrain the properties of the embedded protostellar object . in the following , we discuss implications given by the derived outflow properties and our modelling of the hcn spectra .",
    "collimated outflows have been observed for low - mass cores and , more recently , also for young high - mass objects , supporting the disk accretion scenario ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and ref .",
    "therein ) . in the former case , a high degree of collimation",
    "is linked to early stages and a widening of the outflow opening angle follows during further evolution @xcite . according to some observational evidence , this holds for high - mass sources as well and may provide a basis for their evolutionary classification .",
    "the fact that we observed rather collimated outflows close to their proposed origins smm1 north and south is consistent with the idea that the embedded driving sources have formed and launched the outflows recently .",
    "this is supported by the estimated dynamical timescales of less than @xmath93yr .    the outflow energetics change by orders of magnitude from low - mass cases to luminous high - mass driving sources , and the span of outflow kinetic energies that have been derived is @xmath94j @xmath95 e@xmath96j . for the sample of with l @xmath97l@xmath0 , they got values on the order of e@xmath98j . with e@xmath99j ,",
    "the outflows of the smm1 cores reach the same order of magnitude , in particular because the adopted masses are lower limits .",
    "they exceed those of low - mass cores .",
    "so far we have only considered the molecular outflows close to the cores .",
    "the traced molecular gas has probably been entrained by collimated jets .",
    "if we assume that the h@xmath21 emission features at larger distances stem from these jets , which is supported by the rough alignment with the molecular outflows , we can derive a second timescale for the outflow activity of the cores .",
    "however , we can not constrain the jet velocities from observations .",
    "used a ratio of jet velocity to molecular outflow velocity of 20 , and for the smm1 cores the resulting jet velocities are about 300kms@xmath3 .",
    "this is in the range of velocities that have been observed for herbig - haro flows from low - luminosity sources . from the measured offsets of the outermost h@xmath21 feature in the south - west we got a timescale of approximately @xmath100yr for the smm1 south jet",
    "this is above the molecular outflow timescale of approximately @xmath101yr . for the smm1 north jet ,",
    "the outermost feature in the west gives a timescale of about @xmath101yr , which agrees with the molecular outflow timescale .",
    "accounting for the overall uncertainties , these values are consistent with the proposed relation of jets and molecular flows , which of course does not exclude other scenarios .",
    "parsec - scale jets and outflows have been found towards many young low - mass stellar objects , mostly traced by optical or near - infrared line emission .",
    "the more energetic outflows in the high - mass regime are therefore expected to also extend to these sizes , although few observations were reported to date .",
    "the presumed jets from smm1 support this idea . the filamentary and patchy structure observed in h@xmath21 can be caused by different factors .",
    "besides the varying line - of - sight extinction , the local h@xmath21 abundance may play an important role in determining where the shock - excited emission arises , and the kinematics of internal shocks is presumably influenced by the penetrated medium .",
    "an interesting possibility is the connection to the mass ejection history of the driving source , which is linked to the accretion history for disk - driven outflows .",
    "the several features we detected indicate a varying mass - loss rate for the smm1 cores .",
    "such a burst mode of accretion may result from disk instability driven by infall @xcite .",
    "the s - shape that we observe for the presumed smm1 south jet can be interpreted as a precession of the outflow axis .",
    "the outermost feature we found in the south - west approximately lies on the projected outflow axis with pa @xmath102 we derived from the molecular outflow lobes close to the core , while the features in between are offset to lower pa .",
    "this means the core rotation axis is not along the line - of - sight , but rather has a high inclination .",
    "hcn appears to be more resistant to freeze - out in cold dense cores compared to co - related molecules as hco@xmath29 @xcite . assuming that the hcn emission traces the dense gas in the cores , we investigate in the following if the observed hcn(1 - 0 ) spectra can be , in principle , reproduced by simple models for the core .",
    "first , we considered the `` one - layer '' model where the core is spherically symmetric and homogeneous .",
    "we assumed that the observed spectrum is obtained towards the centre of the core as the antenna beam size is little smaller than the spatial extent of the core .",
    "the parameters of the model are : the hydrogen density n@xmath67 , the temperature t@xmath103 , the molecular column density n@xmath104 , the turbulent velocity v@xmath105 , and the regular velocity v@xmath106 which characterises the radial expansion or contraction of the core .",
    "note that we do not specify the radius of the core as well as the actual abundance of hcn since the emergent spectrum for such a core depends on their product ( cf .",
    "therefore , in the frame of this model we can not independently constrain the relative hcn abundance , the radius of the core , or its mass .    having",
    "specified the above parameters , we generated the model core and performed a line radiative transfer ( lrt ) simulation with the non - lte code of @xcite using molecular line data from .",
    "a synthetic spectrum of hcn(1 - 0 ) was calculated from the lrt simulation . in principle",
    ", the systemic velocity v@xmath107 is an additional parameter .",
    "we have assumed the values of 36.1kms@xmath3 ( smm1 north ) and 34.8kms@xmath3 ( smm1 south ) derived from the positions of the spectral features .",
    "the consistency between calculated and observed spectra was evaluated with a @xmath108-criterion and took into account all the velocity channels of the combined hcn(1 - 0 ) spectrum .",
    "to search for the best set of the model parameters , we used powell s minimisation algorithm @xcite .",
    "we had to specify parameter ranges for the search for the best - fit model . in our simulations we used the ranges given in the table  [ tab :",
    "fitpars ] to derive the best - fit parameter sets .",
    "the ranges resulted from several runs where we specified parts of the adjacent parameter space and did not find good reproductions of the observed spectra .",
    "though unlikely , we can not exclude that additional compatible sets of parameters exist . in order to assure that the minimisation routine was not trapped in a local minimum",
    ", we repeated the calculations starting with several sets of initial parameters .",
    "the best - fit spectra obtained for the one - layer model with the corresponding parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hcnspec ] in the top row .    in the case of smm1 north , the observed line ratios were reproduced fairly well .",
    "we found a degeneracy between the hydrogen density , the kinetic temperature and the hcn column density and therefore we set n@xmath109cm@xmath8 .",
    "this resulted in t@xmath110k and n@xmath111@xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , given the assumption that the observed hcn(1 - 0 ) components are indeed single - peaked and relatively narrow , the effect of the regular and turbulent velocities can not be distinguished .",
    "therefore we set the regular velocity to zero .",
    "the derived value of the turbulent velocity is 0.4kms@xmath3 .",
    "note that in contrast to the study of , we did not have to introduce any regular velocity to explain the `` anomalous '' line ratios .",
    "the obtained ratios naturally appeared as a result of the non - lte excitation in the subcritical density .    in the case of smm1 south",
    ", the one - layer model could not reproduce the maximal intensities and the strength of the self - absorption dips at the same time .",
    "we show one representative spectrum from the one - layer model in fig .",
    "[ fig : hcnspec ] .    a natural way to reproduce",
    "the observed spectrum of smm1 south is to include a low - density envelope in the model which should lead to self - absorption .",
    "we checked this by constructing a `` two - layer '' model with 5 + 5 parameters , and chose a configuration where a static core ( v@xmath112 ) is surrounded by a spherically symmetric , homogeneous envelope .",
    "the increased number of parameters makes it difficult to identify a best set through the minimisation routine .",
    "therefore we fixed some of the parameters based on the following arguments .",
    "first , we assumed that the hydrogen density in the core is higher while in the envelope it is lower than the critical density for hcn(1 - 0 ) . given this assumption",
    ", we expect the formation of strong self - absorption dips if the hcn column density in the envelope is high enough .",
    "we set the densities to n@xmath113cm@xmath8 and n@xmath114cm@xmath8 .",
    "we also fixed the temperature in the envelope t@xmath115k assuming that it is not heated by the inner ( most probably warmer ) part of the core , for which we chose t@xmath116k .",
    "changes in the core temperature do not affect the derived model spectra significantly .",
    "thus , we varied the five parameters n@xmath117 , v@xmath118 , n@xmath119 , v@xmath120 , v@xmath121 , and constrained them using the minimisation routine .    the best - fit spectrum obtained from the two - layer model is presented in fig .  [ fig : hcnspec ] ( bottom ) . the two - layer model could reproduce the intensity , the strong self - absorption dips and asymmetry of the observed spectrum quite well .",
    "the line wings may stem from outflowing gas , or also be due to a more complex velocity profile not incorporated in the model .",
    "the important outcome of this model can be summarised as follows : first , the strong self - absorption in the line profiles can be reproduced by the high - density core together with the low - density envelope .",
    "second , the asymmetry of the line profiles can be explained by the infalling envelope ( we got v@xmath122kms@xmath3 ) , given the relatively high turbulent velocities in the core ( v@xmath123kms@xmath3 ) and in the envelope ( v@xmath124kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , this configuration is not the only way to fit the line asymmetries .",
    "in particular , we were able to reproduce the line asymmetries by the combination of an expanding core and a static envelope because of the similar relative velocities .",
    "we consider this scenario implausible , though , because of the short outflow timescales .",
    "finally , we stress that the considered simple models did not reliably constrain the other parameters of the cores , but they illustrated that the observed spectra can indeed be explained theoretically . in order to get more reliable information about the core properties one has to consider a set of molecular lines and transitions together with more physical models of the source .",
    "unfortunately , the available data , in particular the hco@xmath29(1 - 0 ) measurements , are not sufficient to enable this . indeed ,",
    "if we used hco@xmath29(1 - 0 ) in addition to hcn(1 - 0 ) in our fitting routine , we would have to incorporate two more parameters for the hco@xmath29 abundance ( in the core and in the envelope ) , while hco@xmath29(1 - 0 ) alone will not allow us to further constrain the excitation conditions .",
    "for the latter , at least a few more transitions of hco@xmath29 or its isotopomers were necessary .",
    "on the other hand , a more physical model of the core ( e.g.  with smooth distributions ) has more parameters to fit which makes such a model even more uncertain .",
    "thus , the usage of more sophisticated models is required when detailed spectral maps of the sources are available .",

    "<S> the fate of massive cold clumps , their internal structure and collapse need to be characterised to understand the initial conditions for the formation of high - mass stars , stellar systems , and the origin of associations and clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the onset of star formation in the 75m@xmath0 smm1 clump in the region isoss j18364 - 0221 using infrared and ( sub-)millimetre observations including interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> this contracting clump has fragmented into two compact cores smm1 north and south of 0.05pc radius , having masses of 15 and 10m@xmath0 , and luminosities of 20l@xmath0 and 180l@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> smm1 south harbours a source traced at 24 and 70@xmath1 , drives an energetic molecular outflow , and appears supersonically turbulent at the core centre . </S>",
    "<S> smm1 north has no infrared counterparts and shows lower levels of turbulence , but also drives an outflow . </S>",
    "<S> both outflows appear collimated and parsec - scale near - infrared features probably trace the outflow - powering jets . </S>",
    "<S> we derived mass outflow rates of at least @xmath2m@xmath0yr@xmath3 and outflow timescales of less than 10@xmath4yr . </S>",
    "<S> our hcn(1 - 0 ) modelling for smm1 south yielded an infall velocity of 0.14kms@xmath3 and an estimated mass infall rate of @xmath5m@xmath0yr@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> both cores may harbour seeds of intermediate- or high - mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the derived core properties with recent simulations of massive core collapse . </S>",
    "<S> they are consistent with the very early stages dominated by accretion luminosity . </S>"
