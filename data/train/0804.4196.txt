    "<S> we study thermal broadening of the hole spectral function of the two - dimensional @xmath0 model ( and its extensions ) within the non - crossing approximation with and without the contribution of optical phonons . </S>",
    "<S> we find that phonons at finite temperature broaden the lowest energy quasiparticle peak , however , the string excitations survive even for relatively strong electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> experimental angle resolved photo - emission spectroscopy(arpes ) results compare well with our calculations at finite temperature when we use strong electron - phonon coupling without any adhoc broadening . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have studied the role of vertex corrections and we find that their contribution allows us achieve the same overall agreement with the arpes experimental results but using smaller values for the electron - phonon coupling . </S>"
