    "therefore superluminal soliton motion ( faster than the slowest eigenmode velocity ) is possible @xcite .",
    "it is accompanied by cherenkov - type radiation , due to decomposition of soliton components with eigenmode velocities slower than the speed of the soliton into plasma waves travelling along with the soliton @xcite .    in this work i present numerical analysis of soliton - antisoliton collisions within the coupled sine - gordon equation with focus on josephson vortex ( fluxon ) dynamics in magnetically coupled stacked josephson junctions .",

    "it is demonstrated that soliton - antisoliton pair in the csge can annihilate even in the absence of viscous damping or other perturbations .",
    "annihilation occurs via emission of plasma waves from an oscillating breather , to some extent resembling annihilation of elementary particles via emission of a pair of photons .",

    "fine structure is seen at the zfs below the velocity matching step due to resonances between the shuttling soliton and bouncing waves emanating upon every collision of the soliton with edges . in principle ,",
    "the soliton can interfere and form resonances with any type of periodically emitted waves .",
    "those can be waves emitted by the fluxon upon passing a defect @xcite or cherenkov - type emission @xcite .",
    "however , the resonances seen in fig .",
    "6 ( c ) are different from the previously discussed types .",
    "indeed , we consider an ideal system without defects and cherenkov emission does not take place at the corresponding soliton velocities , as demonstrated in fig . 5 ( a ) .",
    "the observed fine structure of zfs is due to inelastic nature of soliton collision in the csge , even in the absence of perturbations , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "this is specific for the csge and is not present in the unperturbed sg equation , in which the soliton collision is always elastic . even though , some radiation appears in the sg in the presence of dissipation @xmath155 , the effect is very small @xcite . for comparison , in fig . 6 ( a ) we show zfs in a single junction case ( @xmath21 ) , calculated for the perturbed sg with the same parameters as in fig . 6 ( c )",
    ". the velocity - matching step at @xmath156 and @xmath157 is clearly seen .",
    "unlike the csge case , fig .",
    "6 ( c ) , it is entirely due to relativistic lorentz contraction of the soliton , eq .",
    "( [ soliton ] ) . because in this case soliton - image antisoliton collision at the edges is ( almost ) elastic ,",
    "the fine structure is not visible ( a closer inspection reveals the presence of tiny wiggles at the zfs ) .",
    "coupled systems are interesting from the point of view of achieving coherent superradiant emission .",
    "in particular , thz emission from stacked intrinsic josephson junctions in cuprate superconductors at zero applied magnetic field is being actively discussed @xcite .    to estimate the emission from the stack at the zfs , we employed the dynamic radiative boundary conditions , as in ref .",
    "the effective radiative impedance was very large so that radiative losses do not affect soliton dynamics .",
    "the emission power from the left edge of the double junction stack is shown in fig .",
    "noticeably , the emission at the velocity - matching step a is at minimum , despite a large dissipation power @xmath158 , because at point a the soliton is resonating with the ( cherenkov ) out - of - phase eigenmode @xmath159 , see fig .",
    "even though the oscillation amplitude in each junction is very large , destructive interference from the two junctions prevents emission @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the single junction @xmath21 case , shown in fig .",
    "6 ( b ) , in which the maximum emission occurs at the velocity matching step and the emission power is correlated with the total power @xmath160 .    from fig .",
    "6 ( d ) it is seen that the main emission occurs at the lower resonance b , which corresponds to the voltage of the in - phase cavity ( fiske ) mode @xmath161 in the stack @xcite : @xmath162 at this point the shuttling soliton excites the in - phase standing wave in both junctions , which leads to constructive interference and to significant superradiant emission outside the stack @xcite .",
    "note that the emission power at the resonance b is rapidly increasing with decreasing @xmath5 , unlike for the rest of the zfs .",
    "this is a clear indication that the geometrical resonance is indeed taking place at point @xmath163 , because the emission at the fiske step depends on the quality factor of the geometrical resonance and increases with decreasing @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the fiske step at the zfs provides a clear evidence that the shuttling soliton in the csge can indeed strongly interact with cavity modes and travelling waves due to strong emission upon soliton - image antisoliton collisions at the edges . in a similar manner",
    ", the soliton also interacts with josephson oscillations when one or several junctions are in the running ( mccumber ) state with @xmath164 .",
    "this leads to a large variety of resonant states @xcite and may lead to self - oscillation phenomena at geometrical resonance conditions @xcite .",
    "figure 6 ( e ) shows the continuation of the @xmath133-@xmath134 for the same @xmath22 double junction with @xmath165 up to higher bias current .",
    "it is seen that at @xmath166 the system switches from the zfs ( 1,0 ) to another strong resonance c before it goes into the ohmic ( free running ) state . at this resonance",
    "both junctions have the same voltage and are synchronized in - phase .",
    "this leads to a large emission , as shown in panel ( f ) .",
    "such resonances were discussed in refs .",
    "they may combine @xmath9 soliton kinks with a similarly large amplitude waves , which may be difficult to disentangle by just looking at the shapes of phase profiles @xmath167 .",
    "however , we observed that high - order zfs can be clearly distinguished from geometrical resonances by comparing the emission frequency : zfs emit at the sub - harmonics of the josephson frequency @xcite or even at non - josephson frequency @xcite , while self - oscillations at geometrical resonances emit at the harmonics of the josephson frequency @xcite .    to conclude , we have studied soliton - antisoliton collisions in the coupled sine - gordon equation .",
    "it was shown that in contrast to the sine - gordon equation , a soliton - antisoliton pair annihilates in the csge even in the absence of perturbations .",
    "the annihilation occurs via a logarithmic - in - time decay of a breather caused by emission of plasma waves . in a dissipative ,",
    "dc - driven case , a similar phenomenon leads to a strong coupling between the coupled soliton - antisoliton pairs , breathers , and propagating waves , which may lead to self - oscillations at the geometrical resonance conditions .",
    "this phenomenon may be useful for achieving superradiant emission from coupled oscillators .",
