    "lattice solitons are a topic of great interest to ongoing studies of nonlinear dynamics in photonic media and becs ( bose - einstein condensates ) @xcite .",
    "these localized modes are produced by the interplay of the intrinsic nonlinearity of the medium with an effective periodic potential induced in it by permanent or virtual lattice patterns .",
    "in fact , the lattice may itself be a nonlinear structure if it is induced by a spatially periodic modulation of the local nonlinearity @xcite . in the limit of a deep periodic potential",
    ", the fundamental models of lattice media reduce to various versions of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite .",
    "the realization of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) dnls model in arrayed optical waveguides was originally proposed in ref .",
    "the same model was later applied to becs loaded into deep optical - lattice potentials @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a brief review ) .",
    "a physical realization of the dnls model is also possible in the form of lattices of microcavities which serve as traps for polaritons @xcite .",
    "lattice solitons take the form of discrete solitons in terms of the dnls equations , which correspond to quasi - discrete solitons in the respective experimental settings .",
    "such solitons were created in a set of semiconductor waveguides built on top of a slab substrate @xcite , and also in arrays of optical fibers @xcite .",
    "in addition to using permanent photonic structures , quasi - discrete solitons were also made in virtual waveguiding arrays , using the versatile technique of inducing interference lattices in photorefractive crystals @xcite .",
    "the latter method was used to create the first examples of 2d quasi - discrete fundamental solitons moti2d , which was followed by the making of vortex solitons @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , localized lattice excitations with embedded vorticity , that were predicted in ref .",
    "another significant contribution to this area was the creation of 2d solitons in a bundle of fiber - like waveguides written in bulk silica @xcite .",
    "such arrays and bundles are created by means of tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses @xcite .    following the analysis of the fundamental localized discrete vortices with topological charge @xmath1 @xcite , their higher - order counterparts , with @xmath3 , and",
    "multipole discrete solitons , such as quadrupoles , were predicted in refs . .",
    "many other objects were studied in this area , including _ supervortices _ ( circular chains of compact vortices with an imprinted overall topological charge , which is independent of the vorticity of the individual eddies @xcite ) , necklace - shaped patterns @xcite , discrete solitons in hexagonal and honeycomb lattices @xcite , composite _ semidiscrete _ spatial solitons in arrays of waveguides with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities @xcite , quasi - discrete topological solitons in photonic - crystal fibers @xcite , etc .",
    "nonstationary soliton effects were studied too .",
    "these include the mobility of discrete solitons boulder , papa , collisions between traveling ones @xcite , and the onset of the spatiotemporal collapse in self - focusing arrayed waveguides @xcite .",
    "most works on lattice solitons dealt with the spatial - domain settings . in particular , optically - induced lattices in photorefractive crystals do not makes it possible to observe the evolution in the temporal domain because of a very large response time in these materials .",
    "however , the spatiotemporal dynamics can be realized in waveguiding arrays written in bulk silica jenawriting , where the spatially localized quasi - discrete patterns in the transverse plane can be combined with the temporal self - trapping in the longitudinal direction .",
    "recently , the creation of the corresponding quasi - discrete  light bullets \" was reported in this system @xcite ( for a review of spatiotemporal solitons in nonlinear optics and bec , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . previously ,",
    "a number of manifestations of the spatiotemporal self - trapping in similar settings were studied theoretically , including the related modulational instability @xcite , formation of  bullets \" in fiber arrays @xcite and photonic wires @xcite , and self - compression @xcite and steering @xcite of pulsed beams . continuing the work in this direction ,",
    "semi - discrete spatiotemporal surface solitons were introduced , as _ surface modes _ , in models of semi - infinite waveguide arrays mihkiv , and in a system with an interface between different arrays staggunstagg .",
    "also analyzed were spatiotemporal solitons in waveguide arrays with the quadratic nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "once stable fundamental spatiotemporal soliton complexes in bundled arrays of waveguides are available , it is natural to seek for vortex solitons in the same setting .",
    "a systematic analysis of spatiotemporal vortices and quadrupoles in the model based on the square lattice of discrete waveguides was reported in ref .",
    "a vast stability area was found for the solitary vortices with @xmath4 and quadrupoles , which are built as rhombuses , alias on - site - centered modes , with respect to the underlying lattice ( the rhombus is built as a set of four  bright \" cores , with a nearly  dark \" one at the center ) .",
    "the stability region is much smaller for the off - site - centered modes of the  square \" type , without an empty pivotal site in the middle ( the reduced stability domain of square - shaped vortices and quadrupoles , in comparison with their rhombic counterparts , in a generic feature of topological solitons in lattice media @xcite ) .",
    "all the spatiotemporal vortex solitons with @xmath5 were found to be unstable unstable in the same model .",
    "further , collisions between stable vortices and quadrupoles ( with identical or opposite topological charges ) , propagating along the bundle in opposite directions , were analyzed in ref .",
    "four different outcomes of the collisions were identified : rebound of slowly moving solitary vortices , fusion , splitting , and quasi - elastic interactions between fast ones .",
    "hexagonal lattices may be created by means of the same techniques which were used for the building the square - shaped structures . on the other hand",
    ", the change of the underlying geometry may essentially alter fundamental properties of topological lattice solitons @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was predicted theoretically and conformed in an experiment that spatial solitons in the form of double vortices ( with @xmath2 ) in hexagonal lattices may be stable , while their unitary counterparts ( with @xmath1 ) are unstable .",
    "the objective of the present work is to study spatiotemporal vortex solitons in hexagonal lattices of discrete waveguides .",
    "the model is formulated in section 2 , and at the end of it we also briefly consider fundamental solitons , driven by a temporally self - trapped pulse in a single waveguiding core . in section 3 ,",
    "we demonstrate , also in a brief form , that a straightforward input in the form of a hexagon - shaped spatiotemporal vortex with @xmath1 always leads to a decay .",
    "nevertheless , three different species of _ stable _ spatiotemporal complexes with the embedded vorticity are revealed by a systematic numerical analysis . in section 4 , we demonstrate that a spatiotemporal input of a triangular shape generates self - trapped vortices in the form of triangles with an empty core in the middle .",
    "further , in section 5 it is shown that a hexagonally shaped input with @xmath2 produces stable spatiotemporal hexagons with the same ( _ double _ ) topological charge .",
    "finally , a modified ( shifted ) input ansatz gives rise to stable densely packed triangular vortices with @xmath1 , without an empty central core , as shown in section 6 .",

    "<S> by means of a systematic numerical analysis , we demonstrate that hexagonal lattices of parallel linearly - coupled waveguides , with the intrinsic cubic self - focusing nonlinearity , give rise to three species of stable semi - discrete complexes ( which are continuous in the longitudinal direction ) , with embedded vorticity @xmath0 : triangular modes with @xmath1 , hexagonal ones with @xmath2 , both centered around an empty central core , and compact triangles with @xmath1 , which do not not include the empty site . </S>",
    "<S> collisions between stable triangular vortices are studied too . </S>",
    "<S> these waveguiding lattices can be realized in optics and bec . </S>"
