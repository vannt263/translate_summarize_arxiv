    "let @xmath4 denote the standard @xmath0-sphere , the set of all points of distance one from the origin in @xmath5 .",
    "this is a @xmath0-dimensional geometric object with a natural notion of _ antipode _ : if @xmath6 is in @xmath4 , so is @xmath7 , the _ antipode _ of @xmath6 .",
    "a classical result of lusternik - schnirelman - borsuk @xcite ( which we refer to as the lsb theorem ) says that if @xmath4 is covered by @xmath1 closed sets , then at least one of the sets contains a pair of antipodes .",
    "the motivation for this paper grew out of a desire to develop a combinatorial version of the lsb theorem that might provide an alternate combinatorial route to proving this classical topological result .",
    "such methods have been used , for instance , to prove the brouwer fixed point theorem and the borsuk - ulam theorem via combinatorial lemmas due to sperner and tucker , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the @xmath0-cube , sometimes called the @xmath0-dimensional _ hypercube _ , which is a polytope in @xmath9 that is the product of @xmath0 line segments .",
    "( for convenience , we take each line segment to be @xmath10 $ ] . )",
    "this polytope @xmath8 has faces which are also cubes ; these are of dimension @xmath0 or less . for simplicity",
    ", we call a @xmath2-dimensional face a @xmath2-face",
    ". a combinatorial version of @xmath11 is the boundary of @xmath8 , since this boundary is topologically a @xmath12-sphere .",
    "note that this boundary is the union of all _ facets _ , which are @xmath12-faces of one less dimension than the cube itself .",
    "we may ask whether there is a combinatorial version of the lsb theorem in this context .",
    "such a version might begin by covering the facets of @xmath8 by @xmath0 sets that are unions of facets .",
    "let us call such a collection of sets a _",
    "facet cover_. the classical lsb theorem would then guarantee the existence of a set in the facet cover that contains a pair of antipodal points , and by combinatorial methods we shall see in theorem [ facet - cover ] that , in fact , we can guarantee the existence of a set that contains a pair of antipodal @xmath13-faces .",
    "what may be surprising is that we can say something about the existence ( and dimension ) of antipodal faces contained in some _ ridge cover _ , which is a collection of @xmath0 sets that are unions of @xmath13-faces of @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , consider the @xmath14-cube .",
    "if we cover its edges with three sets @xmath15 that are unions of whole edges , we find that some @xmath16 must contain a pair of antipodal vertices .",
    "however , the classical lsb theorem does not say anything about the existence of such a pair .    before describing our main results ,",
    "we give some terminology and background .      for @xmath17 ,",
    "recall that @xmath8 is the convex hull of the @xmath18 points in @xmath19 whose coordinates are all either 0 or 1 .",
    "for example , the 1-cube is the line segment with endpoints 0 and 1 , the 2-cube is the square with vertices 00 , 01 , 10 , and 11 , etc .",
    "thus , any vertex of @xmath8 is denoted by a @xmath0-tuple of 0 s and 1 s . more generally , observe that a ( closed ) @xmath2-face may be specified by a choice of @xmath20 coordinate positions whose values are fixed at either 0 or 1 .",
    "the @xmath2 remaining coordinates vary throughout this @xmath2-face ; we call them _ varying _ coordinate positions of the @xmath2-face",
    ".    thus every @xmath2-face of @xmath8 may be represented by a @xmath0-tuple of x s , 0 s , and 1 s , by putting an x in the @xmath2 coordinate positions that are _ varying _ and putting the fixed values in the coordinate positions that are _",
    "fixed_. this is called the _ coordinate representation _ of a face .",
    "for example , the 2-face of @xmath21 containing the vertices 001 , 101 , 111 , and 011 is represented by xx1 .",
    "we say this face has a _ fixed coordinate _ in the 3rd _ position _ with _ coordinate value _",
    "we say two faces _ differ _ in the @xmath23-th coordinate if their coordinate representations have different symbols in the @xmath23-th position ; else they _ agree _ in that coordinate .",
    "for example the faces xx01 and x0x1 differ in the 2nd coordinate and in the 3rd coordinate , and the two faces agree in the 1st coordinate and in the 4th coordinate .",
    "we now define the concept of antipodes for faces of a @xmath0-cube .",
    "a vertex @xmath24 is the _ antipode _ of @xmath25 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 differ in every coordinate .",
    "clearly this relationship is symmetric , and we may sometimes say @xmath24 and @xmath25 are _ antipodal _ to each other . similarly , we say a @xmath2-face @xmath26 is the _ antipode _ of a @xmath2-face @xmath27 if the antipode of each vertex of @xmath26 lies in @xmath27 and vice versa ; we may also say that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are _ antipodal_. in coordinate representations , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are antipodal if and only if they have exactly the same coordinate positions fixed but differ in those fixed coordinate positions .",
    "furthermore , we say that two sets @xmath28 are _",
    "@xmath2-antipodal _ to each other if @xmath29 contains a @xmath2-face whose antipode is in @xmath30 .",
    "( clearly if @xmath29 is @xmath2-antipodal to @xmath30 , then @xmath29 is @xmath31-antipodal to @xmath30 for all @xmath32 . ) finally , a set that is @xmath2-antipodal to itself is _ @xmath2-self - antipodal_. we take the convention that the empty set is an antipode of itself , which is vacuously true .    since this paper primarily deals with faces of codimensions 1 through 4 , we use the following names .",
    "the term _ facet _ denotes a @xmath2-face of codimension 1 , _ ridge _ denotes a @xmath2-face of codimension 2 , _ peak _ denotes a @xmath2-face of codimension 3 , and we introduce the term _ pinnacle _ to denote a @xmath2-face of codimension 4 .",
    "for example , on @xmath33 , facets are 3-dimensional cells , ridges are 2-dimensional faces , peaks are edges , and pinnacles are vertices .",
    "we consider the empty set to be a face of dimension @xmath34 .",
    "as the @xmath0-cube is symmetric , we choose a specific orientation without loss of generality .",
    "accordingly , we often refer to x ...",
    "x0 as the _ bottom facet _ and to x ...",
    "x1 as the _",
    "top facet_. furthermore , we refer to a @xmath2-face which intersects both the top and bottom facets as a _ spanning @xmath2-face_.    we note two combinatorial facts about the @xmath0-cube which can be proven without difficulty : it contains @xmath35 @xmath2-faces , and @xmath0 edges meet at any of its vertices .",

    "we prove each of these intermediate results in its own section . as an introduction to our methods ,",
    "we first prove the simple statement about facet covers mentioned earlier .",
    "for a facet cover of @xmath8 , the classical lsb theorem guarantees the existence of a set in the cover that contains a pair of antipodal points on the facets of @xmath8 .",

    "[ facet - cover ] for all @xmath48 , a @xmath0-set facet cover of @xmath8 has a set that contains a pair of antipodal @xmath13-faces , i.e. , antipodal ridges .",
    "the dimension @xmath13 is sharp ; antipodal faces of larger dimension can not be guaranteed .",
    "recall that @xmath8 has @xmath49 facets , which are covered by the @xmath0 sets of the facet cover .",

    "thus , @xmath16 covers all ridges of @xmath50 , and to avoid containing antipodal ridges , it must not cover any ridges of @xmath51 . clearly , then , @xmath51 can not lie in @xmath16 , which implies that any other facet in the set must have its fixed coordinate among the first @xmath52 coordinates .",
    "hence the intersection of this facet and @xmath51 is non - empty and must be a ridge .",
    "then @xmath16 contains @xmath50 and a ridge in @xmath51 , which must be the antipode of a ridge in @xmath50 .",

    ".    since @xmath21 contains twelve edges , there must be a cover set which contains at least four edges .",
    "let this set be @xmath16 .",
    "assume , without loss of generality , that x00 ( the blue edge in figure [ 3cubeweak ] ) is in @xmath16 .",
    "this immediately eliminates the red edge x11 and the orange edges 0x1 , 1x1 , 01x , and 11x as potential members of @xmath16 , since they are all 0-antipodal to the blue edge .",

    "this implies that @xmath16 must contain four edges which bound a face .",
    "if it were to contain any more edges , it would be 0-self - antipodal ( as we have shown by elimination ) , so it must contain exactly these four edges .    since @xmath16 was arbitrary ( up to the fact that it contained four edges )",

    "the boundary of any other face must share an edge with each of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , contradicting the fact that @xmath61 must be disjoint from @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus , it is impossible to cover the edges ( ridges ) of @xmath21 with three cover sets such that no set is 0-self - antipodal .    in this proof , we established a fact that will be useful later , so we record it here :    [ c3edge ] let @xmath29 be a collection of at least four edges in @xmath21 with no antipodal vertices . then @xmath29 must bound a 2-face of @xmath21 .",
    "we now move on to the case for @xmath8 , which we prove in much the same way as we did the weak cubical lsb theorem on @xmath21 .",

    "[ weak]the weak cubical lsb theorem on @xmath8 for @xmath42 , any @xmath0-set ridge cover of @xmath8 must have a set that contains a pair of antipodal vertices .",

    "antipodal vertices differ in every coordinate .",
    "thus , if a ridge is to be 0-antipodal to the blue ridge , it must contain a vertex with a 1 in both of the last two coordinates ; this ridge is either the unique red ridge or one of the orange ridges .",
    "therefore , a ridge will be antipodal to the blue ridge if it is of the form ... xx , ...",
    "1x , or ... 11 .",
    "( the first three types determine orange ridges , and the last type determines the red ridge . )",
    "two ridges are parallel if they vary in all the same coordinates , and keep the same coordinates constant .",
    "then there are three ridges parallel to the blue ridge ( besides itself ) : x ... x01 , x ... x10 , and x ... x11 .",
    "the last is the red ridge , but the others are not at all antipodal to the blue ridge ; these , then , are the green ridges .",
    "note that there are always exactly two of them .",
    "the ridges that are not 0-antipodal to the blue ridge share vertices with the blue ridge and with a green ridge .",

    "we are now equipped to show that @xmath16 must be the boundary of a facet .",
    "recall that @xmath16 contains the blue ridge and at least @xmath65 other ridges . in a completely analogous fashion to the previous proof ,",
    "suppose first that at least @xmath65 of these other ridges were purple .",
    "but the purple ridges come in 0-antipodal pairs . in general , given a purple ridge , a 0-antipodal purple ridge can be found by switching the last two coordinates and reversing the value of the other fixed coordinate .",
    "for example , the ridge 0x ... x0 is paired with 1x ... x0x .",
    "again by the pigeonhole principle , since there are @xmath66 such pairs of purple ridges and we are attempting to choose @xmath65 purple ridges , at least one pair must have both members chosen .",
    "this contradicts the condition that @xmath16 not be 0-self - antipodal .",
    "therefore , at least one of the ridges in @xmath16 is a green ridge . again",
    ", it can only be one green ridge , since the two green ridges are antipodal , so that choosing one necessarily excludes the other .",
    "further , once we have chosen a green ridge , any purple ridge meeting the other green ridge is also excluded , as the green ridges are antipodal to each other .",
    "( any purple ridge meets exactly one of the green ridges ; a purple ridge of the form ... x0 will meet the green ridge x ... x10 , while a purple ridge of the form ... 0x will meet the green ridge x ... x01 . )    now @xmath16 may only contain the blue ridge , one green ridge and the half of the purple ridges which meet this green ridge .",
    "these determine the boundary of a facet : for example , if we choose the green ridge x ... x10 , we would be left with the purple ridges of the form ... 0x , so that the facet spanned would be x ... x0 .",
    "note that @xmath16 can not contain any more ridges , else @xmath16 would be 0-self - antipodal ( as we have shown by elimination ) .    since @xmath16 was arbitrary ( up to the fact that it contained at least @xmath63 ridges ) , it is clear that _ each _ set @xmath67 must contain exactly @xmath63 ridges , and each must bound a facet .",
    "hence no two sets can cover the same ridge ; otherwise some other ridge must not be covered .",

    "we first note that the bottom facet can not contain any ridges of @xmath16 , for if it did , the ridge on the bottom facet together with two ridges in the top facet would constitute a set of three ridges with same fixed coordinate position , but differing coordinate values in that position , contradicting lemma [ 3ridgesnopeaks ] .",

    "it must therefore have at least 3 spanning ridges .",
    "there are two general ways that @xmath16 may contain three ridges in the top facet .",
    "one way is depicted in figure [ 4cube3mainast ] , in which the three ridges intersect at a vertex . + without loss of generality , let @xmath16 contain the ridges outlined in blue ( x0x1 , xx11 , and 1xx1 ) .",

    ". see figure [ 4cube3mainast ] .",
    "+ the other way that @xmath16 may contain three ridges in the top facet is if they do not have a common intersection ; they form a `` u '' shape with two of the ridges intersecting the third ridge at different edges .",
    "this , however , results in @xmath16 containing ten edges in the top facet .",
    "therefore , there are only two edges in the bottom facet that are not antipodes to these ; but by assumption , @xmath16 contains three spanning ridges , and these intersect the bottom facet at three distinct edges .",
    "thus one of these edges of @xmath16 in the bottom facet is antipodal to an edge of @xmath16 in the top facet , contradicting our assumption that @xmath16 contains no antipodal edges .",
    "thus the `` u '' shape can not occur .",
    "2 .   suppose that @xmath16 contains 4 or 5 ridges of the top facet , and no ridges belonging to the bottom facet .",
    "for any four ( respectively , five ) ridges in the top facet , at least eleven ( resp .",

    "hence at most one ( resp .",
    "no ) edge in the bottom facet can be covered by the two ( resp .",
    "one ) spanning ridges , a contradiction .",
    "thus this case can not occur .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath16 contains the six ridges of the top facet .",
    "this set does not contain antipodal edges , so it is a valid construction of a six - ridge set .",
    "hence , we see there are only two ways to construct a set with at least 6 ridges so that it does not contain a pair of antipodal edges : the set must contain all six ridges in a single facet , or the set must contain all six ridges in an asterisk set . we now show that such sets can not contain more than 6 ridges .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 contains the ridges of a single facet @xmath106 .",
    "if there were any other ridge in @xmath16 , it would intersect the antipode of an edge in @xmath106 .",
    "alternately , suppose that @xmath16 contains the ridges of an asterisk set , which includes sixteen edges .",
    "the @xmath41-cube contains 32 edges , in sixteen pairs of antipodal edges .",
    "if there were any other ridge in @xmath16 , it would contain at least seventeen edges , which by the pigeon - hole principle would include a pair of antipodal edges .",
    "thus , this set also may not contain more than six ridges .    therefore , in order for the four sets of a ridge cover to cover all 24 ridges in @xmath33 , each must contain exactly six ridges .",
    "[ nofacet4 ] let @xmath16 be one of four sets of a ridge cover of @xmath33 such that @xmath16 contains only ridges which belong to a single facet . then some other @xmath107 in the ridge cover of @xmath33 will contain a pair of antipodal edges .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath16 contain the ridges of the bottom facet ( xxx0 ) .",
    "then @xmath16 does not cover any of the twelve spanning ridges ( those whose coordinates end in x ) .",
    "the spanning ridges must therefore be covered by the other three sets .",
    "these twelve spanning ridges of @xmath33 correspond naturally to the edges of @xmath21 .",
    "namely , if the x at the end of one of the ridge s coordinates in @xmath33 is removed , we simply have the coordinates of an edge in @xmath21 .",
    "for example , x00x lies in @xmath33 and x00 lies in @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , a cover of the ridges of @xmath33 by three sets corresponds to a cover of the edges of @xmath21 by three sets , which by lemma [ weak ] implies there is a set of the cover that contains a pair of antipodal vertices . by concatenating x to the end of their coordinate representations ,",
    "these vertices correspond to edges in @xmath33 that are antipodal and contained in one of the original sets of the ridge cover of @xmath33 .    we now prove theorem [ strong ] on @xmath33 .",
    "lemmas [ 6ridgesperset ] and [ nofacet4 ] show that if four sets of a ridge cover of @xmath33 each contain no antipodal edges , they must all be asterisk sets .",
    "furthermore , no two asterisk sets of a @xmath41-set cover may contain a common ridge because each set has six ridges and @xmath33 contains 24 ridges .",
    "denote the four asterisk vertices by @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "if the asterisk sets of @xmath110 and @xmath90 do not contain the same ridge , they must differ in at least @xmath14 or @xmath41 coordinates ; otherwise any two coordinates on which they agree would determine a spanning ridge that lies in both asterisk sets .",
    "this observation shows that @xmath24 must differ from each of @xmath25 and @xmath111 in at least @xmath14 coordinates ; hence @xmath25 and @xmath111 must agree on at least @xmath112 coordinates , and therefore there is a spanning ridge covered by @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "so four ( indeed , three ) asterisk sets can not cover ridges of @xmath33 without overlap , and therefore four asterisk sets can not cover the ridges of @xmath33 , contradicting our assumption that a @xmath41-set ridge cover of @xmath33 was possible with no set containing antipodal edges .",
    "therefore some set of a @xmath41-set ridge cover of @xmath33 must contain antipodal edges .",
    "we have so far shown that a @xmath0-set ridge cover of @xmath8 contains a set that is @xmath38-self - antipodal , where @xmath115 this proves all aspects of theorem [ complete ] except the sharpness of @xmath38 , which is the statement of theorem [ sharpness ] .    to prove that these values of @xmath38 are sharp for all @xmath47 ,",

    "we give a construction of such a cover , which consists of four asterisk sets together with @xmath124 more sets which cover the remaining ridges .",
    "let us start by choosing four asterisk vertices .",
    "since our goal is to cover @xmath8 with as few sets as possible , we want to choose four vertices such that the union of their asterisk sets covers as many ridges as possible , or equivalently , such that the number of ridges that are covered by more than one set is minimized .",
    "intuitively , if we choose two vertices that are close to each other , there will be many ridges that intersect both vertices .",
    "hence , these ridges belong to the asterisk sets of both vertices .",
    "therefore , we want to choose four vertices such that the `` distance '' between each pair of vertices is maximized .    using the coordinate notation , we can measure the `` distance '' between two vertices by using hamming distance , the number of common coordinates that they share .",
    "for example , in @xmath125 , the vertex @xmath126 is `` closer '' to @xmath127 than it is to @xmath128 .",
    "note that @xmath129 and @xmath130 have @xmath52 coordinates in common , which means that they lie on the same edge . on the other hand , @xmath129 and @xmath131",
    "have only @xmath132 coordinates in common , which means that they lie on the same @xmath41-face .",
    "we can easily check that the intersection of @xmath133 and @xmath134 contains fewer ridges than the intersection of @xmath133 and @xmath135 .",
    "we shall construct asterisk vertices using strings of @xmath136 s and @xmath137 s in various lengths , called _",
    "blocks_. for each @xmath0 , define the blocks @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 to be strings containing all @xmath136 s whose lengths are specified by the following table : @xmath141 let the block @xmath142 be an @xmath143-tuple containing all @xmath137 s , and define @xmath144 and @xmath145 similarly .    without loss of generality ,",

    "the vertex @xmath24 has the same first block as @xmath111 , the same second block as @xmath109 , and the same third block as @xmath25 .",

    "note that the ridges of a 3-dimensional hexagonal prism can be covered by three sets such that no set contains antipodal vertices .",
