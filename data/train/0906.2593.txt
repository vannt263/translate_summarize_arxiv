    "because of the possibilities of the lattice deformations along transverse and longitudinal directions , there exist five typical uniform dimerization patterns that we will display in this paper .",

    "when the site number @xmath15 is so large that the characteristic wave length of the eigen function is greater than the lattice constant @xmath28 , the continuum field approach is appropriately adapted by regarding the mbius ladder as a one - dimensional system with long range hopping ( fig.[fig : fig1](c ) ) .",
