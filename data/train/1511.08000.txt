    "in this paper , we present a new pseudo - spectral method to solve the initial value problem associated to the following non - local kdv - burgers equation @xcite : @xmath0    with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the non - local operator , acting only on the variable @xmath3 , @xmath4    with @xmath5 , and @xmath6    being @xmath7 the gamma function .",
    "the operator @xmath2 can be regarded as a left - sided fractional derivative in the caputo sense , see e.g. @xcite , with integration taken from @xmath8 .",
    "equation ( [ e : uoverr ] ) with @xmath9 and either a quadratic flux , as above , or a cubic one , has been derived from a model of two - layer shallow water flow .",
    "this equation results by performing formal asymptotic expansions associated to the triple - deck ( boundary layer ) theory used in fluid mechanics ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known that hyperbolic systems , such as the two dimensional shallow water model , may exhibit solutions that develop discontinuities or shocks .",
    "these shocks correspond to the so - called hydraulic - jumps or bores in this context . in order to investigate the internal structure of shock waves , it is customary to consider the viscosity of the system or to introduce it artificially . in the particular case studied in @xcite ,",
    "viscosity terms become important near the bottom boundary . in order to take its effect into account",
    ", a boundary layer needs to be introduced .",
    "additionally , the effect due to the stream curvature that becomes important near shock waves can not be neglected .    in @xcite ( for the single layer case ) and in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the authors keep track of the viscosity on the bottom boundary in a way consistent with the navier - stokes equations , by means of matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of the reynolds number tending to infinity . as a consequence , a distinguished limit associated with a _ triple deck _ problem is presented .",
    "the main idea of the triple deck theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) is that the leading order outer flow is not independent of the boundary layer flow , unlike in the classical prandtl s theory @xcite .",
    "these considerations , in a weak interaction limit , lead to an equation of the type ( [ e : uoverr ] ) , where the fractional derivative term results from the effect of viscosity , and the third order term results from the stream curvature .",
    "the infinite domain where the equation is posed corresponds to the domain of the inner region in the asymptotic limit . in this region , traveling wave solutions and their stability are naturally analyzed , since they resemble the inner structure of shock waves .",
    "there are other models where such a fractional derivative terms arise ( see v.g .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the common feature of these models is that they result from the analysis of a boundary layer and thus they need to be studied in an unbounded domain .",
    "the existence of the cauchy problem for ( [ e : uoverr ] ) , and the existence of traveling wave solutions and their stability have been studied rigorously in @xcite ( with @xmath10 ) , and in @xcite ( with @xmath11 ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the study of traveling wave solutions requires naturally that the equation is posed on @xmath12 , since these waves travel along the domain and are expected to emerge in a large time limit .",
    "our aim is thus to present a numerical method that deals accurately and efficiently with the problem posed on @xmath12 , taking particular care of the numerical treatment of @xmath13 .    in the following pages",
    ", we will develop a new pseudo - spectral method for .",
    "essential references on spectral methods can be found in @xcite , together with the more classical @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties in dealing with is the unboundedness of the spatial domain .",
    "however , according to boyd @xcite , the many possible options for unbounded domains always fall into one of three following broader categories :    1 .   truncating the domain ( taking @xmath14 $ ] , with @xmath15 ) .",
    "2 .   using basis functions intrinsic to an infinite interval ( for example , hermite functions , sinc functions ) .",
    "3 .   mapping the unbounded interval to a finite interval , followed by the application of chebyshev polynomials or of a fourier series .",
    "we will adopt the third option here .",
    "it is possible to generate a great variety of new basis sets for the infinite interval , which are the images of chebyshev polynomials or fourier series @xcite under a change of the independent variable @xmath16 that maps @xmath17 into a finite interval .",
    "although an infinite variety of maps is possible , we will concentrate on a very important one , the so - called algebraic map ( see v.g .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath18    with @xmath19 , which maps the whole real line @xmath20 into the interval @xmath21 $ ] and vice versa .",
    "then , we can use the chebyshev polynomials ( of the first kind ) @xmath22 over the new domain @xmath23 $ ] : @xmath24    moreover , allows us to define a basis set for the infinite interval , formed by the so - called rational chebyshev polynomials : @xmath25    these functions form an orthogonal basis in @xmath12 with respect to the weight @xmath26 : @xmath27    rational chebyshev polynomials appear to behave extremely well in a great variety of problems .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , rational chebyshev polynomials , hermite functions and sinc functions were compared when solving numerically two and three - dimensional nonlinear diffusion equations over unbounded domains . while hermite and sinc functions are adequate for the approximation of functions with exponential decay , it was shown in @xcite that rational chebyshev polynomials are the most versatile option , because , besides being a good choice for approximating exponentially decaying functions , they really excel when applied to polynomially decaying solutions .",
    "in fact , in this paper , we consider an exponentially decaying initial data for that become algebraically decaying as @xmath28 increases ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in our opinion , rational chebyshev polynomials are here the best option , and , thus , we have preferred them over other choices like hermite functions and sinc functions .    in general ,",
    "an advantage of not truncating the domain is that the boundary conditions can often be ignored when the domain of integration is infinite ( see @xcite ) , while truncating the domain necessitates setting artificial boundary conditions ( see v.g .",
    "@xcite for a very complete review on artificial boundary conditions in domain truncation problems ) .",
    "although we can work directly with , it is easier to use them under a trigonometric representation , i.e. , through the change of variable @xmath29.\\ ] ]    then , and become @xmath30    i.e. , we reduce the development of a function @xmath31 over @xmath12 in a series of rational chebyshev polynomials to obtaining just a cosine expansion : @xmath32    we recall that , after applying , @xmath33 $ ] , while the cosines are periodic in @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "therefore , in order to compute the cosine expansion of a function defined over half a period , we may use an even extension of that function . at this point",
    ", it is very important to underline that an even extension involving only cosines is by no means the only option .",
    "indeed , we will consider a more general series expansion of @xmath31 under the change of variable @xmath35 : @xmath36    which implies augmenting by a second set of basis functions denoted @xmath37 and defined @xcite by : @xmath38    where @xmath39 are the so - called chebyshev polynomials of the second kind : @xmath40    even if we could work directly with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we follow the strategy recommended by boyd @xcite , i.e. , to change to the trigonometric variable and then apply fourier series .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "s : method ] , we propose a pseudo - spectral method for simulating , which is based on the change of variable , together with the application of a fourier series expansion .",
    "although there are many references on the numerical computation by spectral methods of fractional derivatives , most of them do not seem to consider integration from @xmath8 or to @xmath43 , as is necessary in . for instance , @xcite ( which is based on @xcite ) and @xcite ( for the closely related fractional integration ) make use of the chebyshev polynomials , and in @xcite , legrende , chebyshev and jacobi polynomials are used for the computation of the caputo derivative .",
    "other spectral methods use a suitable generalization of jacobi polynomials for the computation of fractional derivatives ( see for instance @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we remark that these generalized jacobi polynomials are well suited in the case of bounded domains ; since , in that case , they form an orthogonal basis , and the elements of this basis are mapped into the basis by application of fractional derivatives .",
    "fractional derivatives are also implemented in the chebfun package from matlab , where the gauss - jacobi quadrature is used ( see v.g .",
    "@xcite ) . in @xcite , a spectral method for substantial fractional differential equations on a semi - infinite domain",
    "is developed , without truncating the domain ; notice that this fractional derivative has a much more regular kernel . in any case , we have found no references on the computation of the fractional derivative of rational chebyshev polynomials .",
    "hence , the central part of this paper is the accurate computation of the operator , or , more precisely , of @xmath44 , which is done in section [ s : fractional ] ; whereas , in section [ s : regularity ] , we do a numerical study on the minimum regularity required by the involved functions .",
    "the structure of strongly suggests the use of an implicit - explicit ( imex ) scheme in time , where the highest - order term , @xmath45 , appears implicitly , and the other lower - order terms appear explicitly ; this is done in section [ s : timediscretization ] .",
    "the numerical experiments are carried out in section [ s : experiments ] , and show that we can simulate until extremely large times .",
    "let us finish this introduction by mentioning that , in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in solving fractional partial differential equations ; in particular , equations with non - local diffusions , as in , ( see for instance @xcite for fractional laplacian ) ; @xcite for advection - diffusion with non - local diffusion ; and @xcite , for a spectral method applied to non - local reaction - diffusion equations ) .",
    "moreover , a computation of the fractional evolution burgers equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "as explained above , in order to simulate numerically , we map the space domain from @xmath12 into @xmath46 $ ] via the change of variable @xmath35 , and then apply fourier series to the resulting equation .",
    "we discretize the space variable at the non - final nodes : @xmath47    where @xmath48 , which divide the interval @xmath49 $ ] in @xmath50 equally - spaced parts .",
    "again , @xmath51 .    as mentioned in the introduction , instead of working only with cosines",
    ", we consider a more general series expansion of @xmath52 in the form .",
    "however , the implementation is done with more ease by expanding @xmath52 into series of @xmath53 : @xmath54,\\ ] ]    where , in order to determine the coefficients @xmath55 , it is necessary to decide how to extend the function from @xmath33 $ ] to @xmath34 $ ] ; i.e. , we discretize @xmath56 $ ] in @xmath57 nodes , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "we recall that , if we consider an even extension , we have a cosine expansion , while an odd extension yields a sine expansion .    in general , given a @xmath57-term approximation of a @xmath60-periodic function @xmath52 @xmath61,\\ ] ]    it",
    "is possible to determine uniquely the @xmath55 by evaluating at @xmath62 @xmath63    e^{2ijk\\pi / ( 2n)};\\ ] ]    then , @xmath64    where @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , the discrete fourier transforms and can be computed very efficiently by means of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xcite .",
    "observe that , although is in principle exact only at the @xmath62 , it is nonetheless a very good approximation for all @xmath66 , provided that @xmath52 is regular enough and that @xmath50 is large enough .",
    "let us mention also that , in order to _ clean the spectrum _ , it is convenient to round to zero those @xmath55 whose absolute value is smaller than the epsilon of the machine , @xmath67 .    let us express now all the terms of in function of the new space - variable @xmath66 .",
    "it is straightforward @xcite to check that @xmath68    therefore , given @xmath52 in the form of , we can compute @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 very efficiently . indeed ,",
    "let us suppose that @xmath52 consists of just one node , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "then , representing @xmath73 and @xmath74 in polar form , becomes @xmath75    from , we can construct immediately ( very sparse ) differentiation matrices in the fourier side .    at this point",
    ", some comment about the choice of @xmath76 is required ; indeed , the correct choice of the scaling is a matter of concern .",
    "even if there are some theoretical results @xcite , the optimal scaling values depend on the number of points , the class of functions , and the type of problem , and can even change during time . however , a good working rule of thumb seems to be that the absolute value of the function at the extremal grid points is smaller than an accuracy threshold @xmath77 .",
    "the most involved part in this paper is the accurate computation of the fractional derivative @xmath78 .",
    "the operator @xmath79 , in the form of , is not very well - suited for numerical calculations when @xmath80 is close to one , because @xmath81 tends to infinity as @xmath82 . on the other hand , throughout this paper , we are considering solutions that remain at least @xmath83 for all time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we can safely integrate by parts : @xmath84      \\cr & = \\frac{1}{\\gamma(2-\\alpha)}\\int_{-\\infty}^x v''(y)(x - y)^{1-\\alpha}dy,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    because , for a fixed @xmath16 , @xmath85    the last condition is satisfied by all the functions we are interested in ; for instance , in , one expects that @xmath86 tends exponentially to a constant as @xmath87 , if the initial condition decays sufficiently fast ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a similar reasoning enables us to conclude that @xmath78 and @xmath88 are equivalent . indeed , differentiating : @xmath89    where we are assuming that , for a fixed @xmath16 , @xmath90    in the numerical method that we propose , it is compulsory to integrate once by parts , as is done in . on the other hand , instead of working with , it is possible to first compute numerically , and then differentiate it numerically .",
    "however , we have chosen to work with , because it is more compact to implement and more accurate .",
    "let us consider the change of variable @xmath35 from ; then , using , @xmath91d\\eta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , becomes @xmath92(\\cot(s ) -",
    "\\cot(\\eta))^{1-\\alpha}d\\eta      \\cr = & \\int_s^{\\pi}w(\\eta)(\\cot(s ) - \\cot(\\eta))^{1-\\alpha}d\\eta,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath93.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we want to approximate at the nodes @xmath62 defined in . at this point , instead of applying a quadrature formula like the trapezoidal rule directly to , we have chosen to transform it into an integral over @xmath49 $ ] by means of a characteristic function : @xmath94}(\\eta)(\\cot(s ) - \\cot(\\eta))^{1-\\alpha}d\\eta.\\ ] ]    now , given a function @xmath95 defined over @xmath49 $ ] and whose value is known over the nodes , a way of approximating its integral is by means of the well - known chebyshev - gauss quadrature @xcite : @xmath96    however , in practice , we have found that applying this last formula to gives poor results ; because , inside the integrand , @xmath97}(\\eta)(\\cot(s_j ) - \\cot(\\eta))^{1-\\alpha}$ ] has the singularity point precisely at @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , we consider instead the families of nodes @xmath99    since @xmath100 never coincides with any @xmath62 , we avoid evaluating @xmath97}(\\eta)(\\cot(s_j ) - \\cot(\\eta))^{1-\\alpha}$ ] at the singularity point , so we can apply to at the new nodes , to obtain an approximation that depends on @xmath101 : @xmath102^{(m ) } u(s_j ) & \\equiv \\left[\\partial_x\\mathcal d^\\alpha\\right]^{(m ) } v(x_j )      \\cr & \\equiv \\frac{\\pi}{2^mn}\\sum_{l = 0}^{2^mn-1 } w(s_l^{(m)})\\chi_{[s_j,\\pi]}(s_l^{(m)})(\\cot(s_j ) - \\cot(s_l^{(m)}))^{1-\\alpha }      \\cr & = \\frac{\\pi}{2^mn}\\sum_{l = 2^{m-1}(2j+1)}^{2^mn-1 } w(s_l^{(m)})(\\cot(s_j ) - \\cot(s_l^{(m)}))^{1-\\alpha},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , in the last line , we have used that @xmath103    bearing in mind the fourier decomposition of @xmath52 , it is possible to evaluate at @xmath104 fast and accurately . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath105 , applying it to , we get an expression similar to those in : @xmath106    where we need to consider only @xmath107 , because @xmath108 .",
