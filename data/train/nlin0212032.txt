    "when studying tunnelling in non - separable systems with more than one degree of freedom , one immediately encounters difficulties which generically can be traced back to the absence of enough constants of motion . even in the very peculiar case of integrable systems , where continuous symmetries provide as many constants of motion as degrees of freedom ,",
    "as soon as separability is lost , the analysis of tunnelling is not a simple generalization of what occurs in one - dimensional ( 1d ) autonomous systems .",
    "the later case is detailed in textbooks on quantum physics ( see for instance  @xcite ) and it has even been possible to give a comprehensive analytical treatment in term of complex solutions of the hamilton equations  @xcite",
    ". however , it is not until the mid - eighties that a satisfactory quantitative approach has been proposed  @xcite for tunnelling in non - separable integrable systems involving a larger number of dimensions .",
    "moreover , integrability is a property of higher dimensional systems which is not generic .",
    "the coupling between several internal degrees of freedom as well as the coupling to an external source usually destroys some global constants of motion . with such a lack of constraints on the dynamics ,",
    "the classical motion in phase space may become chaotic : it may explore volumes with higher dimensionality and therefore becomes exponentially sensitive on initial conditions .",
    "it is not surprising that these deep qualitative differences between an integrable regime and a chaotic one appear at the quantum level too .",
    "some of the properties of a _ quantum _ system do change when constants of motion are broken and , indeed , it is the very object of quantum chaos to study the signatures of classical chaos at the quantum level ( see for instance  @xcite to see how rich , vivid and successful this domain is ) .",
    "we define tunnelling as a quantum process which is classically forbidden to _ real _ solutions of classical equations of motion . in this paper",
    ", we consider hamiltonian systems only and study how the non - dissipative breakdown of continuous symmetries affects tunnelling .",
    "we do not consider how tunnelling is modified by dissipation and decoherence of the quantum wave .",
    "of course , this requires a great care in real experiments where making dissipation negligible is always a hard task .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why very few real experiments have been done on these questions , though they would definitely help to understand tunnelling in the presence of chaos ( as far as we know , the only experiments explicitly made on chaotic tunnelling in the xx@xmath0 century are those presented in  @xcite with electromagnetic microwaves instead of quantum waves ) .",
    "during the last fifteen years however , theoretical and numerical investigations on autonomous 2d and time - dependent 1d hamiltonians systems highlighted some mechanisms  @xcite and much insight has been gained on the influence of non - separable dynamics .",
    "experimental evidence of such mechanisms would be of great interest especially in the light of the subtle interplay between interferences and disorder .",
    "these phenomena lie in the general context of wave transport in complex media where the role of disorder is played by the ( deterministic ) chaotic dynamics instead of having a statistical random origin .",
    "of course , other important motivations can be found in the numerous domains where tunnelling plays a crucial role as a fundamental quantum process like ionization  @xcite , absorption , nuclear radioactivity , molecular collisions , mesoscopic physics etc .",
    "more speculatively , studies on tunnelling in high dimensional hamiltonian systems should provide us with a natural extension of the instanton techniques which deal with quantum field theories reducible to effective 1d autonomous lagrangian systems .    in 2001",
    ", it has been shown both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite that atom cooling techniques  @xcite ( and possibly molecular physics as well , where formally similar systems have been extensively studied  @xcite ) provide systems which fulfill all the severe requirements to study tunnelling in the presence of classical hamiltonian chaos : accurate manipulation of internal and external degrees of freedom , precise control of dissipation and decoherence and on the preparation / detection set up . for a brief account intended for a large audience",
    "see  @xcite ) .",
    "the present article has the ambition to mark out the future challenging experiments , that remain to be done for reasons which will hopefully appear clear in the following .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : chaotictunnelling ] we give a general and informal overview . in section  [ sec : effhamsyst ] , we quickly recall the main theoretical apparatus that is needed in the following .",
    "we implicitly refer to  @xcite for details and demonstrations . in section  [ sec",
    ": experiments ] , we comment the results of  @xcite and  @xcite . in section  [ sec : numexp ] , we show in this context , with the help of numerical experiments , the very precise form taken by the phenomenon known as chaos assisted tunnelling .",
    "we explain why it has not been observed yet with real atoms and propose how to actually bring it to the fore . before the concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we give in section  [ sec : subtleties ] some more numerical results which illustrate how subtle the signatures of chaotic tunnelling can be .",
    "the simplest situation to illustrate tunnelling is probably the case of a particle placed in a 1d time - independent symmetric",
    "double - well potential ( see fig .  [ fig:2well_generalization1 ]  ( a ) ) .",
    "a generalization of the paradigmatic double well potential ( a ) is to consider tunnelling between stable islands that are related by any discrete symmetry in phase space .",
    "case ( b ) corresponds to hamiltonian   with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "here , the time reversal symmetry plays the role of parity in case ( a ) .",
    ", width=321 ]    starting in one well with an energy that is below the maximum of the potential , a quantum particle can jump into the other well with a non zero probability though it is a forbidden classical process .",
    "in addition to the classical time scale  @xmath3 given by the oscillating period _ inside _ one well , we therefore have a longer time scale , the tunnelling period  @xmath4 of the oscillations _ between _ the wells . in the eigenenergy spectrum",
    ", tunnelling appears as a quasi - degeneracy of the odd and even - symmetry states whose energies are both of the order of  @xmath5 but differ by an exponential energy splitting @xmath6 where  @xmath7 is a @xmath8-independent typical action and can be interpreted in terms of a unique complex classical trajectory under the barrier  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we generalize this elementary situation in two ways .",
    "first , unlike the parity in the previous example , we can deal with a symmetry which is not necessarily either a spatial one or a two - fold one .",
    "in other words , we can have any discrete symmetry group acting on the whole phase space as well as any @xmath9-fold symmetry which lead to bunches of @xmath9-uplets in the energy spectrum ( or bands if @xmath10 ) . in the following we keep @xmath11 since we have a two - fold symmetry  @xmath12 actually playing the role of parity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2well_generalization1 ]  ( b ) ) and being somehow decoupled from the other discrete symmetries .",
    "the classical structure in phase space is globally invariant under  @xmath13 and the quantum eigenstates can be classified according to their symmetric or antisymmetric character under the unitary transformation which represents  @xmath12 in the hilbert space of states . because @xmath12 acts in phase space , it is usually more complicated than a pure spatial transformation . thus , the two regions of phase space connected by _ quantum _ tunnelling , but _ classically _ not connected , are in general not separated by a simple potential barrier , but by a more complicated dynamical barrier .",
    "in such a case , tunnelling is emphasized to be called `` dynamical tunnelling '' as suggested by davis and heller in  @xcite .",
    "it often happens that the classically unconnected region are associated to the same region of configuration space , with different momenta .",
    "a simple study of the density probability in configuration space is then unsufficient to characterize dynamical tunnelling ; an analysis of the density probablility in momentum space is required .",
    "the second kind of generalization leads to much more puzzling questions .",
    "when dealing with systems with several degrees of freedom or , equivalently , if an external time dependence exists , classical trajectories generically lose their regular behavior , can not analytically be computed and are organized in a fractal hierarchy that is described by the kam perturbative scenario . recently",
    ", important progress has been achieved in the understanding of the continuation of these intricate structures in complex phase space and their role at the quantum level , see  @xcite and especially  @xcite .",
    "anyway , we are therefore led to the following typical quantum chaos question : if one is able to create two symmetric stable islands separated in classical phase space by a chaotic sea whose volume is under control ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bifurc2yeuxclassique ] ) , what is the effect of this sea on the ( dynamical ) tunnelling between the islands ?",
    "poincar surfaces of section correspond to hamiltonian   with @xmath14 .",
    "two stable islands in the vicinity of the origin are created by a pitchfork bifurcation at  @xmath15 . above this value ,",
    "chaotic motion progressively invades phase space in between the two stable islands . at  @xmath16 , the latter are no longer connected by regular trajectories .",
    "the experimental configuration used in the nist experiments corresponds to  @xmath17 just before the islands disappear in a bifurcation cascade at  @xmath18 .",
    ", width=321 ]    the `` dual '' situation where chaos is created _ inside _ the wells while the dynamical barrier is kept regular has been introduced and studied theoretically and numerically in  @xcite . for a better understanding of what occurs in the energy spectrum",
    "when regular wells are separated by a chaotic sea , it has been proposed in  @xcite to slightly break the tunnelling symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , in the following of the present paper , it must be kept in mind that a discrete symmetry will be always maintained exactly . at last , a third kind of generalization where the hamiltonian character is destroyed by introducing dissipation and/or coupling to a thermal bath , is beyond the scope of this work  @xcite .",
    "following  @xcite ( see also  @xcite in a different context ) we deal with an effective 1d time - dependent system whose hamiltonian is @xmath19 in dimensionless units . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two classical real parameters that can be modified in real experiments . in addition , there is also one parameter , namely @xmath22 , which fixes the quantum scale and is defined by the usual relation between canonical operators :  @xmath23={{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\hbar_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$ ] .",
    "it turns out that @xmath22 is not constant any longer ( see section  [ sec : experiments ] below )",
    ". it can be also experimentally varied via the rescaling factor that is needed in the canonical commutation relation in order to work in dimensionless units used to write  .",
    "the time dependence breaks the conservation of energy and therefore may generate chaos . in order to deal with such a hamiltonian , it is crucial to remark that it has both a spatial and a temporal periodicity .",
    "the latter implies that the floquet theorem can be used , which states that the hilbert space is spanned by an orthonormal eigenbasis of the evolution operator over one period .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues of this unitary operator are distributed on the unit circle and therefore are labelled by their phase , which is conveniently written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the period of the modulation and @xmath26 can be interpreted as a quasi - energy , a generalization of the notion of energy level for a time - periodic system .",
    "the spatial periodicity of the hamiltonian is also extremely important , as it makes it possible to split the hilbert space into independant components , each component being characterized by the so - called bloch vector @xmath27 in the @xmath28 - 0.5,0.5]$ ] range : under translation of @xmath25 along @xmath29 the quasi - energy eigenstates are just multiplied by the phase factor @xmath30 one is thus reduced to solve the floquet - schrdinger equation in an elementary spatial cell with boundary conditions depending on @xmath31 one thus generates  for a fixed value of @xmath27  a discrete quasi - energy spectrum @xmath32 when the full range of @xmath27 values is considered , one obtains the familiar ( quasi-)energy bands  @xcite .",
    "there is an additional discrete symmetry which can be used .",
    "the hamiltonian   is invariant under the time - reversal symmetry @xmath33 in the classical surfaces of section , this implies a symmetry with respect to the @xmath34 axis . in situations like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig:2well_generalization1]b , this implies the existence of pairs of symmetric classically unconnected tori , i.e. a situation where tunnelling could be observed . in the quantum world",
    ", the situation is slightly more complicated , because this symmetry connects the @xmath27 subspace to the @xmath35 subspace . in the particular case @xmath36 ( @xmath37",
    "could also be used ) , this implies that the floquet eigenstates can be split in two subclasses of states which are either even or odd under the symmetry operation . the splitting between a doublet of even and odd states",
    ", @xmath38 will be a measure of tunnelling .",
    "we will extensively use the husimi representation of a quantum state  @xcite .",
    "such a representation associates to each quantum state @xmath39 a phase space function  @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 and @xmath34 are real numbers ) defined by @xmath42 where  @xmath43 is the coherent state corresponding to the complex number  @xmath44 .",
    "because  @xmath43 is a minimal gaussian wave packet with average momentum @xmath41 and average position @xmath34 , the husimi function @xmath40 contains some information about the degree of localization of  @xmath39 in phase space , and makes it possible to associate quantum states with classical phase space structures .",
    "under some severe conditions which constrain the experiments , hamiltonian   can be obtained as an effective dimensionless hamiltonian for cold neutral independent atoms of mass  @xmath45 interacting with two counterpropagating laser beams  @xcite .",
    "these two beams have two slightly different frequencies at  @xmath46 and  @xmath47 .",
    "the longitudinal coordinate  @xmath48 and the dimensionless  @xmath34 are related by @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the rescaling of the momentum is given by  @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath20 and  @xmath21 are fixed by the intensity of the lasers and the detuning of the laser frequencies with respect to the atomic resonance . the dimensionless time  @xmath52 is taken in @xmath53 units and the expression of the effective planck constant is  @xmath54 where @xmath55 . since _ in fine",
    "_ we want to measure exponentially small tunnelling splittings  @xmath56 , it requires to maintain these conditions for a time at least larger than @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , a very accurate control of the preparation of the initial state and of the analysis of the final state is compulsory .    as shown above , because of the temporal and spatial periodicity of the hamiltonian , observing the standard signature of tunnelling , that is an oscillation of a quantum state between two classically unconnected regions of phase space requires that a single doublet of floquet - bloch eigenstates is initially populated , with well defined values of the parameters @xmath58 but also with a well defined value of the bloch angle @xmath27 .",
    "if more than a single doublet is populated , additional frequencies ( related to energy differences between the various populated floquet states ) will appear in the temporal evolution .",
    "if any parameter is not fixed , the experimental signal will be the superposition of tunnelling oscillations ( with different frequencies ) for various sets of parameters .",
    "this will at best  if the dispersion of the parameter values is reasonnably small  blur the oscillations at long time and at worst will completely destroy the signature of dynamical tunnelling .",
    "it is experimentally rather simple to keep an accurate time - periodicity of the driving signal , i.e. to fix @xmath59 similarly , the balance between the constant and the oscillatory term , hence the parameter @xmath21 is easily controlled .",
    "the @xmath20 parameter is proportional to the laser intensity and may thus slightly vary across the atomic cloud ( because of the transverse structure of the laser beams ) .",
    "the most difficult part is to control that a single bloch angle @xmath27 is excited .",
    "indeed , this requires a phase coherence of the initial wavefunction over a large number of laser wavelengths , which is extremely difficult to achieve experimentally  @xcite , as will be shown in the following . in any case , the inhomogeneous broadening of the experimental signal because of the dispersion in @xmath27 will be responsible for a decay of the tunnelling oscillations .      in the nist experiments , the two stable symmetric islands are chosen quite close in phase space in order to deal with not too small splittings .",
    "another crucial point of this experiment is that the classical motion of the islands over one period , unlike those in  @xcite and  @xcite , always remains trapped in one spatial elementary cell of length @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum states localized in these islands are consequently only weakly sensitive on the boundary conditions which are governed by the bloch angle . in other words",
    ", the tunnelling period will be only weakly dependent on the bloch angle @xmath27 , which implies that the unavoidable broadening over @xmath27 will not spoil too much the signature of tunnelling .",
    "this is a major improvement over the tunnelling described in  @xcite and  @xcite , where a very narrow band of bloch angle is required to observe clear tunnelling oscillations .",
    "moreover , the atoms involved in the tunnelling process stay longer in the region where the laser intensities are uniform .    indeed , as proposed in  @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and 5 ) the two stable symmetric islands are created from a pitchfork bifurcation of the fixed point at @xmath60 . to visualize it ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bifurc2yeuxclassique ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) , we extract a one - parameter sequence by varying @xmath20 while @xmath21 is fixed to the experimentally chosen value in  @xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath61 . when @xmath20 is increased , the pairs of symmetric tori appear at  @xmath15 . at the center of each set ot tori , there is a periodic orbit . over one period of the driving ,",
    "the periodic orbit is essentially a rotation over the fixed point at @xmath62 which explains that the whole structure remains trapped in a single spatial cell . for @xmath63",
    "the tori remain nested in one connected stable island . at",
    "@xmath64 a chaotic sea separates the symmetric islands which shrink and move away from the central point before being dissolved through a cascade of bifurcations starting at  @xmath18 .    in one series of experiments , @xmath65 and  @xmath66 ,",
    "the atoms are prepared in one island and their average momentum @xmath67 is measured stroboscopically every modulation period ( @xmath68 in dimensionless units ) . since , in phase space , the islands rotate about the origin with the same period , if no tunnelling occurred no variation in @xmath69 would be noticeable .",
    "in fact , starting the measurement sequence when @xmath69 has its maximum value , oscillations are observed which illustrate the back and forth motion of the atoms between the islands due to dynamical tunnelling . the tunnelling period  @xmath70 is about 10 modulation periods in this case ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the quasi - energy splitting obtained numerically for the two floquet eigenstates having the largest husimi functions inside the islands .    it is worth noting that the nist group uses a bose - einstein condensate as a preliminary step for preparing atoms in well defined quantum states , especially for achieving a large coherence length for the wavefunction , i.e. a small spreading of the bloch angle @xmath31 in order to prepare phase space localized states ,",
    "an optical lattice is carefully turned on .",
    "when the tunnelling experiment starts , the atomic density and the interaction between atoms is sufficiently small , and the experiment can be analyzed as the interaction of individual independent atoms with the laser beams , i.e. using hamiltonian  .",
    "however , the cloud of atoms remains cold enough , at a sub - recoil temperature , to prevent a large thermal broadening of momentum distribution that would destroy the signal .",
    "because they start from very low temperature , these preparation techniques based on condensate manipulation seem to allow a wider room to manoeuvre than those working with thermal clouds only .",
    "adiabatic switching of the light potentials is not required and one can actually work with values of the classical parameters  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 which are far from the perturbative regime of an integrable system .    by diagonalizing the evolution operator corresponding to eq .   over one period , we are not only able to reproduce the oscillatory behavior of  @xmath72 ( see fig .

    "if @xmath82 denotes the width of the momentum distribution in recoil momentum units , it can be shown  ( * ? ? ? *",

    "other states must be taken into account and their influence can be enlightened when a classical parameter ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) or the quantum one ( @xmath22 ) is continuously varied .",
    "two ( quasi-)energies may exactly get degenerate if they belong to distinct symmetry classes .",
    "if not , they may follow a so - called avoided crossing whose size reflects the direct coupling between the two states ( more precisely the off - diagonal matrix element of the coupling perturbation ) , but also the indirect coupling with other states .",
    "one of the keys of the chaotic tunnelling problems is to identify clearly the qualitative nature and the quantitative influence of indirect coupling .",
    "this is the background of austin experiments .",
    "a third level is involved in a non negligible indirect coupling when its quasi - energy approaches the tunnelling doublet energies .",

    "when a third level is crossing a tunnelling doublet when a parameter of the hamiltonian is varied , there is an avoided crossing between the third level and the member of the doublet with the same symmetry , while the other member of the doublet ( with opposite symmetry ) ignores the third level .",

    "an exponential decrease , as described by eq .",
    "is visible , as a straight line with a negative slope in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the regime of fluctuations can be seen for  @xmath94 when @xmath22 is small enough for the de broglie wavelength to be comparable to the size of the chaotic sea between the two islands . , width=321 ]    figure  [ fig : split_flogamma ] shows that , after a smooth decrease of @xmath56 up to  @xmath95 there is an abrupt change of regime .",
    "first , the mean value of @xmath56 increases and second , many fluctuations appear which modify the splitting by several orders of magnitude .",
    "it is remarkable that this change of regime can be matched on the poincar surfaces of section .",
    "the smooth tunnelling regime occurs the resonant tori belong to one quasi - integrable island . for  @xmath96",
    "we are able to reproduce the main features of tunnelling by using an integrable approximation ( see appendix ) .",
    "the decrease of tunnelling is directly understood in terms of the lengthening of the dynamical barrier .",
    "@xmath97 corresponds exactly to the point where the islands get disconnected . in addition , one can follow the bifurcation on the husimi representations of the tunnelling doublet .",
    "one can hardly detect by eye any regularity in the chaotic regime but four large spikes in the range  @xmath98 .",
    "this can be traced back to the crossing by the same third state whose quasi - energy line is folded four times in the floquet zone centered on the doublet .",
    "figure  [ fig : split_flohbar ] shows  @xmath56 as a function of  @xmath99 for four values of  @xmath20 . here",
    "again , two types of regimes , a quasi - regular and a chaotic one , can clearly be distinguished .",
    "for the values of @xmath20 where some substantial chaos is present in between the islands , by decreasing  @xmath100 one gets to the chaotic regime . for @xmath93 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the quasi - regular regime , one may enter in a chaotic regime but for far much low value of  @xmath22 since the chaotic layers between kam tori are so thin that they are not even resolved in the poincar surface of section given in the figures .    on this plots , a purely exponential law given by eq .",
    "would produce a straight line with negative slope .",
    "it gives rather poor predictions in the chaotic regime and should be corrected even in the quasi - integrable regime in order to reproduce the fluctuations .",
    "whenever such a fluctuation is due to a crossing by a quasi - mode ( and not a state delocalized in the surrounding chaotic sea ) , it might be reproduced by the resonance assisted tunnelling techniques .",
    "in order to reproduce quantitatively the statistics of the tunnelling splitting fluctuations in the chaotic regime , leyvraz and ullmo  @xcite have introduced a random matrix model .",
    "the hamiltonian can be split in two uncoupled components associated with the two even and odd symmetry subspaces .",
    "the corresponding matrices are written as : @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 represent the energies of the doublet , @xmath104 the hamiltonian in the chaotic sea ( modelled by a random gaussian matrix ) and @xmath105 the indirect coupling .    neglecting direct tunnelling",
    "consists in taking  @xmath106 .",
    "the central hypothesis is to consider all the  @xmath105 s as independent variables with _ the same _ gaussian distribution .",
    "this is quite natural to treat all the other states on the same footing , as they are assumed to be chaotic states randomly delocalized in the chaotic sea . with these assumptions ,",
    "the splitting distribution can be calculated and is given by a ( truncated ) cauchy distribution , see  @xcite . for hamiltonian  , in each chaotic case where it has been tested ,",
    "the leyvraz - ullmo prediction is in agreement with the numerical results ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "more surprisingly , we have found that the leyvraz - ullmo law gives correct predictions even when the classical dynamics is quasi - integrable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lulawcounterexample ] and the corresponding poincar surface of section in fig .  [ fig:2well_generalization1 ] ) and the de broglie wavelength much larger than the chaotic layers .",
    "statistical distribution of the tunnelling splittings as @xmath22 is varied in the quasi - integrable case corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig:2well_generalization1 ]  ( b ) ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the numerically observed distribution ( small circles ) is in good agreement with the leyvraz - ullmo law ( solid line ) which is supposed to be valid in the chaotic case , as it treats all the states coupled to the tunnelling doublet on the same footing .",
    "this clearly indicates that a leyvraz - ullmo distribution is not sufficient to characterize chaotic tunnelling .",
    ", width=321 ]    when looking at the splitting , one observes numerous and large fluctuations ( over several orders of magnitude ) which were supposed to characterize the chaotic regime .",
    "conversely , we have not been able to find a regular regime of fluctuations with a classically chaotic dynamics .",
    "therefore one must conclude that even though two different regimes of tunnelling fluctuations can be identified unambiguously , classical chaos appears to be a sufficient but not a necessary condition for having numerous and large fluctuations governed by the leyvraz - ullmo law .",
    "these unexpected results are not explained at the present state of the theoretical approaches of chaotic tunnelling .",
    "if it appeared , within future numerical or real experiments , that these results are not due to the peculiar properties of our system , it would definitely mean that theoretical studies should be all the more needed .",
    "in this paper we have studied in great details the transition between a regular and a chaotic regime of tunnelling within a classical configuration that can be achieved experimentally .",
    "we have shown why @xmath22 has to be small enough if one wants to reach for the first time the chaotic regime in real systems . in recent experiments with cold atoms",
    ", it requires to increase the modulation period up to one order of magnitude ( that is at least the  mhz ) .",
    "theoretically , there is also a lot of work to do if we want to understand and therefore predict the fluctuations quantitatively .",
    "the semiclassical regime requires to study carefully the dynamics with complex coordinates .",
    "however , the present work has shown clearly that the abrupt transition between a regular and a chaotic regime of tunnelling corresponds to a classical transition that can be identified very precisely .",
    "tunnelling being a relevant concept in a semiclassical regime only , it is therefore not surprising that the future investigations on chaotic tunnelling will have to keep track of the classical dynamics in one way or another .",

    "when one classical parameter is smoothly varied in a non - integrable hamiltonian system , its periodic orbits follow infinite fractal - like cascade of bifurcations through which they can not be followed smoothly .",
    "however , all the bifurcations can be classified according to a simple set of scenarios : for a given bifurcation of a given periodic orbit , the phase - space dynamics of the original parameter - dependent hamiltonian can be uniformly approximated by an integrable parameter - dependent hamiltonian which retains the relevant features only .",
    "of course , because one can not get rid of the chaotic dynamics , this approximation does make sense only locally , that is near the periodic orbit , in the neighborhood of the bifurcation .",
    "it is the object of the hamiltonian normal form theory to classify the bifurcations and obtain the simplest form of the approximated integrable hamiltonians ( the so - called normal forms ) .",

    "let us sketch briefly how to obtain the hamiltonian normal form in our case .",
    "the first step is to find the value  @xmath108 of  @xmath20 at which the bifurcation occurs ( @xmath21 is kept fixed ) .",
    "such a bifurcation occur when the trace of the monodromy matrix  @xmath109 at the origin after one period is 2 and corresponds in the @xmath110-plane to the border of the even arnold tongues ( see fig .",
    "20.1 in  @xcite ) ( the transitional case occurs when @xmath111 at the border of the odd arnold tongues ) . more precisely , the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifurc2yeuxclassique ] corresponds to @xmath14 ( the experimental value in the nist experiment ) and the bifurcation takes place at @xmath112 . in the following , we use @xmath113 .",

    "the prime stands for the derivative with respect to  @xmath48 . for  @xmath121 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath122 where @xmath123 for @xmath14 .",
    "the second step is to make a ( linear ) @xmath25-periodic canonical change of coordinate that eliminates the time - dependence in the quadratic part of hamiltonian  , near the origin and uniformly in  @xmath124 .",
    "we are then led to the hamiltonian @xmath125    where  @xmath126 are @xmath124-independent coefficients .",
    "only @xmath127 evaluated at  @xmath121 will be relevant since  @xmath82 and @xmath128 can be eliminated by a suitable canonical change of coordinates following a method explained in  @xcite . in our case",
    "we are therefore led to the following normal form of the quadratic part of the hamiltonian : @xmath130    \\3 .",

    "* sections and 4.2 ) , all higher order @xmath25-periodic terms , but the resonant terms of the form  @xmath131 , can be cancelled by a suitable canonical change of coordinates . because of the time reversal symmetry , the coefficient  @xmath132 vanishes identically and therefore the leading order normal form is @xmath133 the explicit calculation of  @xmath134 is tedious but it can be estimated numerically by fitting the coordinate  @xmath135 of the satellite @xmath25-periodic orbits for  @xmath136 .",
