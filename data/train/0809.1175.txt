    "determining the orbital elements of binary stars helps us to obtain fundamental information , such as the masses and radii of individual stars , that has an important role in understanding the present state and evolution of many interesting stellar objects .",
    "analysis of both light and radial velocity ( hereafter rv ) curves , derived from photometric and spectroscopic observations , respectively , yields a complete set of basic absolute parameters .",
    "one historically well - known method to analyze the rv curve is that of lehmann - filhs ( cf .",
    "smart , 1990 ) . in the present paper",
    "we use the method introduced by karami @xmath0 mohebi ( 2007a ) ( = km2007a ) and karami @xmath0 teimoorinia ( 2007 ) ( = kt2007 ) , to obtain orbital parameters of the nine double - lined spectroscopic binary systems : nsv 223 , ab and , v2082 cyg , hs her , v918 her , bv dra , bw dra , v2357 oph , and yz cas .",
    "our aim is to show the validity of our new method to a wide range of different types of binary .",
    "the nsv 223 is a contact system of the a type and the mass ratio is believed to be small ( rucinski et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "the large semiamplitudes , @xmath1 , suggest that the orbital inclination is close to @xmath2 .",
    "the spectral type is @xmath3 and the period is @xmath4 days ( rucinski et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "the ab and is a contact binary .",
    "the spectral type is @xmath5 .",
    "the period is @xmath6 days .",
    "it is suggested that observed period variability may be a result of the orbital motion in a wide triple system .",
    "the third body should then have to be a white dwarf ( pych et al .",
    "2003,2004 ) .",
    "v2082 cyg is most probably an a - type contact binary with a period of @xmath7 days .",
    "the spectral type is @xmath8 ( pych et al .",
    "2003,2004 ) . in hs",
    "her , the effective temperatures were found to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the primary and secondary stars , respectively ( cakirli et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the secondary component appears to rotate more slowly .",
    "the presence of a third body physically bound to the eclipsing pair has been suggested by many investigators .",
    "the two component are located near the zero - age main sequence , with age of about @xmath11 myr ( cakirli et al .",
    "it is classified as an algol - type eclipsing binary and single - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "the spectral type of more massive primary component is @xmath12 .",
    "the effective temperature is about @xmath13 for the primary component and @xmath14 for the secondary component .",
    "the period is @xmath15 days ( cakirli et al .",
    "the v918 her is an a - type contact binary .",
    "the spectral classification is a7v .",
    "the period of this binary star is @xmath16 days ( pych et al .",
    "2003,2004 ) .",
    "the bv dra and bw dra have a circular orbit . from spectrophotometry",
    "the components of bv dar are classified as f9 and f8 while the components of bw dra are g3 and g0 .",
    "the period of bv dra is @xmath17 days and for bw dra is @xmath18 days ( batten & wenxian 1986 ) .",
    "the v2357 oph was classified as a pulsating star with a period of @xmath19 days .",
    "the spectral type is g5v ( rucinski et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "the spectral type of primary component of yz cas is a1v and for the secondary is f7v .",
    "the period of this binary is @xmath20 days ( lacy 1981 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we give a brief review of the method of km2007a and kt2007 . in sect .",
    "3 , the numerical results are reported , while the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "one may show that the radial acceleration scaled by the period is obtained as @xmath21 where the dot denotes the time derivative , @xmath22 is the eccentricity , @xmath23 is the longitude of periastron and @xmath24 is the radial velocity of system with respect to the center of mass .",
    "also @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the period of motion , @xmath27 is the semimajor axis of the orbit and inclination @xmath28 is the angle between the line of sight and the normal of the orbital plane .    equation ( [ pz : ] ) describes a nonlinear relation , @xmath29 , in terms of the orbital elements @xmath30 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . using the nonlinear regression of eq .",
    "( [ pz : ] ) , one can estimate the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath23 , simultaneously .",
    "also one may show that the adopted spectroscopic elements , i.e. @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are related to the orbital parameters .",
    "here we use the method of km2007a and kt2007 to derive both the orbital and combined elements for the nine different double lined spectroscopic systems nsv 223 , ab and , v2082 cyg , hs her , v918 her , bv dra , bw dra , v2357 oph , and yz cas .",
    "since the paper has become very much lengthened by a large number of very similar diagrams and tables , hence only the result for nsv 223 is presented here and the results of other systems are reported in karami et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . using measured radial velocity data of the two components of nsv 223 obtained by rucinski et al .",

    "( 2008 ) .",
    "figures [ nsv_pri ] to [ nsv_sec ] shows the radial acceleration scaled by the period versus the radial velocity for the primary and secondary components of nsv 223 . for other systems ,",
    "12 to 27 in karami et al .",
    "the solid closed curves are results obtained from the non - linear regression of eq .",
    "( [ pz : ] ) , which their good coincidence with the measured data yields to derive the optimized parameters @xmath30 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the apparent closeness of these curves to ellipses is due to the low , or zero , eccentricities of the corresponding orbits . for a well - defined eccentricity",
    ", the acceleration - velocity curve shows a noticeable deviation from a regular ellipse ( see karami @xmath0 mohebi 2007b ) .",
    "the orbital parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , obtaining from the non - linear least squares of eq .",
    "( [ pz : ] ) and the combined spectroscopic elements including @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath32 obtaining from the estimated parameters @xmath30 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for nsv 223 are tabulated in tables [ nsv_orbit ] to [ nsv_combined ] . for other systems , see tables 3 to 18 in karami et al .",
    "the velocity of the center of mass , @xmath38 , is obtained by calculating the areas above and below of the radial velocity curve .",
    "where these areas become equal to each other , the velocity of center of mass is obtained .",
    "tables [ nsv_orbit ] to [ nsv_combined ] show that the results are in good accordance with the those obtained by rucinski et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) for nsv 223 .",
    "using the method introduced by km2007a and kt2007 , we obtain both the orbital elements and the combined spectroscopic parameters of nine double lined spectroscopic binary systems .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the those obtained by others using more traditional methods .",
    "there are some awareness about very close or contact binaries which show some anomalies from more general ( detached ) binaries .",
    "systematic differences are sometimes found from standard keplerian models .",
    "even so , the results which are obtained appear comparable to those found by other authors using other methods .",
    "this does not mean that all these results are correct .",
    "it just implies that where systematic differences appear they affect the results found by different methods of analysis in similar ways .",
    "there are also some awareness about the complication binaries which do not behave in an ideal way .",
    "for example , active rs cvn type binaries with spots and the non - uniform surface flux distribution should affect the radial velocities .",
