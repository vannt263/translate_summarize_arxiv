    "a wormhole is a region of space - time with non - trivial topology .",
    "it has two mouths connected by a throat .",
    "the mouths are not hidden by event horizons , as in the case of black holes , and , in addition , there is no singularity that could avoid the passage of particles from one side to the other .",
    "after the pioneering paper by morris & thorne @xcite , wormhole solutions to the einstein field equations has been extensively studied in the literature ( see refs . @xcite and references cited therein ) . + static wormhole structures require the violation of the average null energy condition in the wormhole throat in order to exist",
    ". plainly stated , this means that the matter threading the wormhole must exert gravitational repulsion to stay stable against collapse .",
    "although there are known violations to the energy conditions ( e.g. the casimir effect ) , it is currently far from clear whether large macroscopic amounts of `` exotic matter '' exist in the nature . if natural wormholes actually exist in the universe ( e.g. if the original topology after the big - bang was multiply connected ) , then there should be observable electromagnetic signatures that could lead to their identification . + cramer et al .",
    "@xcite and torres et al .",
    "@xcite have recently studied the microlensing effects of a negative mass ( e.g. a natural stellar - size wormhole ) on the light from a background point - like source [ for a macrolensing study see @xcite ] .",
    "these authors have shown that the typical lightcurves expected from microlensing events produced by wormholes should be very different from the lightcurves in ordinary ( positive mass ) microlensing of point sources . in the standard case",
    ", a time symmetric burst in the flux density from the background source occurs .",
    "if the lens , instead , is a wormhole , the gravitational repulsion creates an obscure umbra region , deflecting light rays that should , otherwise , reach the observer .",
    "the wormhole basically acts as a divergent lens .",
    "however , light is concentrated on the border of the umbra region producing two separated intensity enhancements that are observed before and after the occultation event .",
    "these two burst are individually asymmetric under time reversal , although they are mirror images of each other . in the first burst , the observed flux increases towards a divergency and then drops to zero . the infinity , or  caustic \" , and the vertical drop to zero are consequences of the ideal model adopted in the calculations , with a point source at the background .",
    "a more realistic model should consider an extended source with a given intensity distribution over it .",
    "+ recently , anchordoqui et al .",
    "@xcite searched in existent gamma - ray bursts databases for signatures of wormhole microlensing .",
    "although they detected some interesting candidates , no conclusive results could be obtained .",
    "peculiarly asymmetric gamma - ray bursts @xcite , although highly uncommon , might be probably explained by more conventional hypothesis , like precessing fireballs ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . even in the case of galactic microlensing",
    ", highly asymmetric curves can be the effect of microlensing by binary stellar systems @xcite .",
    "hence , although binary lenses produce asymmetric lightcurves with different shapes than those that would be produced by wormholes , discriminators other than the lightcurves are needed in order to identify wormhole microlensing events .",
    "+ in this paper , we expand the analysis of cramer et al .",
    "@xcite and torres et al .",
    "@xcite to the extended source case .",
    "this allow us to present more realistic lightcurves for wormhole microlensing events . then , using this formalism , we compute the effects of a finite source extent on the spectral features of microlensing . we show that limb darkening of the intensity distribution on a stellar source induces specific chromaticity effects that are very different from what is expected in the positive mass lens case .",
    "thus , multi - color optical observations can be used to search for galactic natural wormholes .",
    "in addition , we study the extragalactic wormhole microlensing of background agns taking into account the variations of the source size with the observing wavelengths .",
    "this extends the previous work by torres et al .",
    "@xcite , who first considered these kind of events at gamma - rays adopting a point - like source .",
    "we show that also in this case the spectral evolution during the wormhole microlensing event presents peculiar signatures that allow its identification .",

    "the star radius was considered , as before , equal to @xmath37 . in the case of an ordinary lens",
    ", we see that as it gets closer to the star , the color of the observed source becomes redder due to the differential amplification of the coldest regions . when the lens transits towards the star interior , the hot center starts to dominate the amplification , producing a dramatic change in the slope of the color curve .",
    "this is basically the result recently found by han et al .",
    "+ if we now look at the color curves for the negative mass lens case , we notice a clear contrast in the behaviour .",
    "the spectral changes start long before than in the standard situation .",
    "initially , the source also becomes redder and then experiences a switch when shorter wavelengths begin to dominate .",
    "contrary to what happens with positive masses , the spectral trend changes again , with the source appearing colder and colder until it vanishes in the umbra during the transit . when the source is seen again ,",
    "the inverse behaviour is observed .",
    "let us now turn to the extragalactic microlensing case , which was previously studied by torres et al .",
    "@xcite using point sources",
    ". we shall study the lightcurves produced by a stellar - mass extragalactic wormhole when it crosses the line of sight to a background compact source , namely and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . as discussed by torres et al .",
    "@xcite , a critical requirement to observe a significant light magnification during the microlensing event is that the size of the source , when projected onto the lens plane , is not larger than the einstein ring of the lensing mass .",
    "this is necessary because otherwise light from outside the ring could become dominant and smooth out the gravitationally induced variability . in the case of an agn ,",
    "since the size of the emitting regions varies with the wavelength , the gravitational amplification will be more effective at those wavelengths at which the source is more compact .",
    "the wavelengths where the amplifications are maximized are located at gamma - ray energies @xcite .",
    "+ the compactness of the gamma - ray central region of an agn is determined by the opacity to the propagation of gamma - ray photons in the x - ray field produced by the object . since the opacity is a function of the photon energy , the size of the observable gamma - ray photosphere",
    "will also depend on the observing energy .",
    "differential amplification during the microlensing event , then , should lead to chromaticity effects . in order to compute these effects ,",
    "we shall adopt a radius of the photosphere given by the maximum height at which photons of energy @xmath38 are absorbed by pair creation in the x - ray radiation field of the inner accretion disk . according to becker & kafatos @xcite ,",
    "this size is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the x - ray spectral index of the accretion disk radiation field . in our calculations",
    ", we shall adopt an average value @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the larger photospheres , then , are those observed at the higher energies . to compute the microlensing effects on the agn",
    ", we define a reference source with radius @xmath42 and gamma - ray energy @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 where we have written @xmath45 and @xmath42 in units of the einstein radius @xmath4 .",
    "+ the intensity of the source ( without lensing ) is uniform and its spectrum follows approximately a power law : @xmath46 with @xmath47 typically in the range @xmath48 .",
    "we can write this latter eq . in the form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the intensity of the reference source .",
    "the surface intensity distribution is assumed to be constant at a given energy @xmath51 then , the total amplification of the source due to microlensing can be computed as @xmath52 since @xmath53 does not depend on @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 from eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and eq .",

    "( [ e9 ] ) to compute the expected lightcurves and the spectral evolution during the microlensing event .",
    "the results are shown , for a variety of impact parameters , in figures 4 - 7 , where we define @xmath61 as the ratio between @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "+ the main point to be emphasized in the spectral evolution of the lensed source is that , when the source is a wormhole , the spectrum emerges from the umbra at its lowest level ( the bottom curve in the spectral plots ) and then it jumps to its maximum , from where it decreases slowly keeping its slope in the log - log diagram .",
    "this occurs because after the transit the intensity have to recover from the umbra null values .",
    "the effects of the differential obscuration also appear as a clear break in the spectrum at early times since the transit .",
    "this break , with a hardening at low energies , results because the smaller and less energetic gamma - spheres emerge from the umbra after than the more energetic ( and bigger ) ones , and then are initially less amplified .",
    "the break in the spectrum is best appreciated in figure 6 , where the impact parameter is @xmath64 .",
    "+ in the case of positive lenses ( upper set of panels in the figures ) the evolution is smoother , decreasing the emission at all wavelengths after the transit .",
