    "it has recently been possible to realize new small - size materials with nontrivial topologies .",
    "tanda et al . were able to have mobius bands formed by crystals of niobium and selenium , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "given the recent interest in spintronics , it seems therefore worth the effort to study the possible effect of geometry on spin , especially the combined effect of non - orientability and non - simple connectedness of the space .",
    "geometric effects in physics are often hidden in terms of constraints .",
    "one good example of this is the @xmath1 vacua of qcd .  here , the different topological sectors are due to the gauss constraint @xcite .",
    "the chern number also appears due to constraints either in physical space or momentum space .",
    "while studying charge density waves in a torus geometry , thouless found that in this case , the conductivity is expressed in terms of the chern number of the manifold and differs from the periodic lattice case in euclidean space @xcite .",
    "spin currents in semiconductors is still another problem where the chern number can be used to explain the universality of the spin conductivity in the rashba model @xcite .  in this latter case",
    ", the constraint is in momentum space which is homotopic to the plane without the origin , a non - simply connected space .  a final example",
    ", we give , is the quantization of the spin of the @xmath2 skyrmion .",
    "the solution to this problem was possible only after extending @xmath2 to group @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however in this extension , a new term is needed in the lagrangian , the wess - zumino term , which has a topological significance and it is related to the disconnectedness of @xmath4 .",
    "this latter example shows the inter - connectedness of topology of fields and spin .    in this work ,",
    "we address similar issues between spin and topology of the physical space of electrons on non - orientable manifolds such as a mobius band .",
    "in this case there is no global well defined spin structure for the manifold @xcite .",
    "it is well known that quantum mechanical wave functions in non - simply connected spaces can be multivalued and are therefore well defined only on their simply connected covering spaces @xcite .  for non - orientable manifolds ,",
    "we show that a definition of spin is possible by going to the orientable double cover of the initial space .",
    "this work was motivated by tanda s group and a simple calculation that is presented in the application section .  for thin - film rings",
    ", we observed that there is a critical radius at which the trivial ( or commonly used ) spin representation becomes higher in energy than the non - trivial ( twisted ) spin representation .",
    "this twisted representation should correspond to the trivial representation on a mobius band .",
    "the critical radius is estimated to be around @xmath5 for a clean conductor .  the typical ring sizes today is in the @xmath6 range , but it is expected that much smaller sizes will be available in the future @xcite .",
    "therefore , we claim that at these small scales the spin in the mobius band and in the ring should behave the same way , e.g. , as it interacts with an external magnetic field or in a ferromagnetic material .",
    "however , before a physical analysis of our claim is possible , a consistent definition of spin structures in non - orientable manifolds is needed .",
    "spin is an inherently relativistic effect of the electron and follows from requiring lorentz - invariance of the schrodinger equation @xcite .",
    "the relativistic treatment of the spin is not necessary but it considerably simplifies the formal discussion .    in this paper , we study in some detail , the different spin structures that are possible in non - trivial geometries .  for non - orientable manifolds , the spin group is extended to a pin group where parity is violated similar to the extension of the special rotation group @xmath4 to the full rotation group @xmath7 .  in this latter case ,",
    "the @xmath8 group double covers @xmath7 with the group @xmath9 being a connected component of @xmath8 which double covers the connected component of @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath4 .  so far only ref .",
    "@xcite makes use of pin structures to give a viable alternative explanation of a physical theory such as superconductivity .  in this latter work",
    ", cooper pairs can be substituted for a more geometrical interpretation which is the existence of a two - inequivalent spin structures in a ring .",
    "hence in any non - trivial geometry , knowing the number of inequivalent pin structures is important to know before writing a lagrangian for the dynamics @xcite .",
    "for the sake of generality , we will allow even time non - orientable manifolds to be part of the discussion .",
    "the work in the literature that covers questions related to the existence and the counting of the different pin structures is mostly recent .  a comprehensive introduction to pin group structures can be found in refs .  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "pin groups first appeared in ref.@xcite and were derived from clifford algebras in relation to the k - theory of vector bundles .",
    "after that karoubi @xcite studied the obstructions to these pin structures within fiber bundles theory and hence was confined to pin structures that are only derivable from a clifford algebra .",
    "as is well known , there are eight non - isomorphic * * z**@xmath10 extensions of the full lorentz group @xcite .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the disconnectedness of the full lorentz group and hence there is no unique universal two - cover as is the case for the special orthocronous lorentz group .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the results on the orientable case and set the notation for the rest of the paper . in section iii",
    "we introduce the pin group through the clifford algebra . in section",
    "iv we introduce a new definition for equivalence among pin structures that works in non - orientable spaces and study its meaning on the level of representations of the pinor field .",
    "section v addresses the question of the counting of the inequivalent pin structures defined on a non - orientable manifold in light of the new definition .  in section",
    "vi , we apply the results to two cases ; a nano - circuit that has the geometry of a torus and a non - orientable de sitter space .  for the nanocircuit",
    "we argue that it is the nontrivial spin representation that must be used instead of the trivial one .",
    "in section vii , we summarize our results .",
    "in what follows , it is assumed that we are dealing with manifolds with metrics that have the signature @xmath11 and we will not address any questions that are dependent on the metric propre .  a good review on the mathematics involved here can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .  in this section ,",
    "we review the spin structures on orientable manifolds and set the notation for the rest of the paper .    for an orientable manifold @xmath12 , such as the de sitter space @xmath13 ,",
    "a spin structure exists whenever the second stiefel - whitney class vanishes @xcite .",
    "this is the same as saying that the transition functions of the lorentzian frame bundle lift up to new transition functions with values in the @xmath14 group .",
    "the number of inequivalent spin structures is given by the number of classes in @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath14 is a double cover for the lorentz group @xmath16 , which is the connected component of the identity of the orthogonal group @xmath17 .",
    "this double covering induces some restrictions on the transition functions of a spin structure .    for a manifold to be orientable ,",
    "the @xmath17 group structure of the frame bundle should be reducible to @xmath18 by choosing an orientation .",
    "since the sequence    @xmath19    is a short exact sequence , we get the following long exact sequence @xcite ,    @xmath20    recalling that @xmath21 is the set of equivalence classes of principal @xmath18-bundles , then @xmath22 is orientable if and only if @xmath23 the last map is null .",
    "this map is by definition the first stiefel - whitney class @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , the short exact sequence    @xmath25    induces a long exact sequence , @xmath26 hence @xmath22 has a spin structure iff the last map is null .",
    "this latter map is the second stiefel - whitney class @xmath27 and hence it is the obstruction to a spin structure on the space @xmath28 .  for non - orientable spaces , @xmath29",
    ", we need to establish similar sequences to the respective groups and this will lead us naturally to the pin group .",
    "pinor groups are better understood from clifford algebras @xcite . given a vector space @xmath30 of dimension @xmath31 that is tangent to a point @xmath32 and @xmath33 a bilinear non - degenerate quadratic form on @xmath30 associated with the metric @xmath34 .",

    "the involution @xmath51 in @xmath30 extends naturally to an involution @xmath52 of the algebra which in turn induces a @xmath53 grading of @xmath43 , i.e. ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 contains the even ( odd ) elements of the algebra .    a norm function can be defined on @xmath43 by first defining conjugation on the generators :    @xmath56    then the norm of @xmath57 is defined by    @xmath58    let @xmath59 be the subset of all invertible elements of @xmath60  actually in our case where the dimension is even we might as well define the norm without the inversion @xmath61  the clifford group @xmath62 is the subgroup of @xmath59  defined by    @xmath63    given @xmath64 , then it can be represented by an orthogonal transformation    @xmath65    if we were to drop @xmath52 from the definition , the map @xmath66 fails to be a representation in the odd dimensional case .  finally , the _ pin group _ is the subgroup of the clifford group with elements of modulus one ,    @xmath67    this group doubly covers the orthogonal group @xmath17 .",
    "the sequence @xmath68 is then a short exact sequence .",
    "we say that @xmath69 is a @xmath70extension of @xmath17 .    finally , it is important to realize that not all pin groups are derived from a clifford algebra .",

    "the starting short exact sequence that was fundamental to his construction is however not correct .",
    "this is easily seen by applying the second homomorphism theorem .",

    ", we will be only interested in determining the degrees of freedom on the spin structures for a given topology .",
    "we hope to address the question of obstructions in the future .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new definition for equivalence among ( s)pin structures that takes into account the possible non - orientability of the physical space of the system .  the definition is suggested such that the non - orientability is linked to the orientable cover of the space .",

    "the quantization is automatic for the non - trivial spin structure .",

    "next we comment on a procedure for obtaining the green s function and the effective action for a particle interacting with an electromagnetic field @xmath404 based on the proper time method @xcite .",
    "this is a relativistic method that starts with the dirac equation .",
    "we just state the results since they exhibit explicit gauge invariance . for the one - particle green s function",

    "these expressions are valid in euclidean space . the phase factor is clearly isolated in the expression for the green functions .",
    "hence a non - trivial spin structure will clearly affect the green s function of the theory .",
    "in particular the energy will be different in both cases .  in the following",
    ", we will assume that there is only a magnetic field and no spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we calculate the energy in both cases . in terms of green s function with one - body potential ,",
    "the energy is given by : @xmath409 in fourier space , we have @xmath410 where @xmath411 , for spin up and spin down .  for    [ ptb ]    a periodic lattice with period @xmath412 in the @xmath57 direction , we have @xcite @xmath413 for a regular periodic lattice in euclidean space , the wave functions are periodic : this is the configuration that corresponds to the trivial spin structure . in this case",
    "the energy is given by @xmath414 for a twisted configuration , we have instead the energy : @xmath415 the difference in energy for typical values of @xmath416 and @xmath417 @xmath418 . in arbitrary units",

    "hence from an energy point of view , the spin will choose to be in the lowest energy state possible that is compatible with the geometry of the circuit .",
    "in this case there will also be a flux quantization associated with changes in the current .",
    "since we are in the ballistic regime , each electron travels in closed paths around the circuit .",
    "any change in the number of particles that traveled around the torus will give rise to a flux or a vector potential .",
    "the current is not polarized at zero temperature and hence each pair of electrons with spin up and spin up will give a change in flux as that _ postulated _ in ref .",
    "@xcite to recover the landauer - buttiker formula in non - simply connected circuits with one hole. therefore it seems the assumption can be proved if the nontrivial spin configuration is taken into account .",
    "we also observe that having twisted leads in the circuit will not change the ( s)pin structures in this calculation as shown in the previous sections .",
    "[ ptb ]      in this section we treat non - orientable cases .",
    "first we take a non - orientable manifold , @xmath420 , where @xmath421 .  from our discussion above , it was found that inequivalent @xmath422 structures were given by @xmath423 .",
    "this latter result has been found by different methods in @xcite .  finally , we would like to say more about the new adopted definition for equivalence by going back to the example of the projective plane that we mentioned earlier .",
    "here however , we take a more physically motivated approach .",
    "let @xmath424 , be a pinor field on @xmath425 .",
    "the structure group of the frame bundle is @xmath426 .",
    "let @xmath427 be a local frame on the open set @xmath428 the sets @xmath429  cover @xmath425 and their intersections are contractible so local sections are always well defined . on intersections",
    "@xmath430 we have @xmath431 on the pinor frame level , we have @xmath432 and @xmath433 .",
    "we require that @xmath434 and @xmath435  transform as a scalar and a vector respectively .",
    "the @xmath436 defined here are the pauli matrices . from this",
    "we get the following conditions on @xmath437 , @xmath438 to find explicit expressions , we need to choose a covering .",
    "@xmath425 is topologically equivalent to a disk with the boundary antipodally identified .",
    "next we parametrize the boundary with an angle @xmath439 .",
    "choose a simple cover for the strip adjacent to the boundary , we will need at least three open neighborhoods .",
    "non - trivial transition functions will be needed only as we go along the boundary .",
    "they are of the form @xmath440 where @xmath441 is a reflection about the first axis . using this cover",
    ", we find that @xmath437 must have the form @xmath442 .",
    "imposing boundary conditions on @xmath443 , we find that @xmath444 hence , the two @xmath445 structures predicted above .",
    "the phase factor @xmath446 is clearly due to the reflection @xmath441 .",
    "moreover , it is physically irrelevant and ignoring it amounts to ignoring @xmath447 i.e. , the non - orientability of the space .  therefore quantum mechanics should be studied first on the orientable cover and then projected on the configuration space .",
    "in summary , we have given a definition to spin structures on non - orientable manifolds by going to the orientable double cover .",
    "this allowed us to determine the number of inequivalent spin structures using our definition of equivalence .",
    "we also showed that in the typical structure of a nano - circuit , the nontrivial spin configuration is probably more important than the trivial one at nanometer scale .",
    "this argument is supported indirectly by the work in ref .",
    "a convincing proof of this statement will be to solve the problems with the constraints on the motion of the particle explicitly taken into account .",
    "this is a very difficult problem .",
    "we believe the energy argument that we presented is compelling enough to continue looking into other aspects which can result from the nontrivial spin configuration .",
    "smaller non - orientable structures than those made by tanda et al .",
    "should also be possible in the near future and provide an experimental test of the idea presented here .",
    "finally , there is one question that we did not discuss in this work and that is related to the nature of phase transition at the critical radius of ring between the two spin structures .",
    "this is an interesting question mathematically and physically .",
    "we are not the first to raise this question ; jarosczewicz asked a similar question regarding the spin of @xmath448 solitons @xcite .",
    "to avoid introducing one more flavor to quantize the spin , he introduced the idea of a rotating soliton which corresponds mathematically to the nontrivial paths in @xmath449 .",
