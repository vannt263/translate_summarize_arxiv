    "<S> so in general there is no unique entanglement measure for the manipulation of entanglement by ppt operations . </S>",
    "<S> we further present a feasible sufficient condition for the irreversibility of entanglement manipulation under ppt operations .    * </S>",
    "<S> introduction : * a basic feature of many physical processes is the appearance of irreversibility . in the area of quantum information science , entanglement plays a central role and the irreversibility in entanglement manipulations has been studied in the last two decades .    </S>",
    "<S> the manipulation of entanglement under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) is generally irreversible in the finite - copy regime . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the amount of pure entanglement that can be distilled from a finite number of copies of a state @xmath1 is usually strictly smaller than the amount of pure entanglement needed to prepare the same number of copies of @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in the asymptotic settings where the number of copies tend to infinite , this process of entanglement manipulation for bipartite pure states is shown to be reversible @xcite . in contrast , for mixed states , this asymptotic reversibility under locc operations does not hold anymore @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one requires a positive rate of pure state to generate the so - called bound entanglement by locc @xcite , while it is well known that no pure state can be distilled from it @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> various approaches have been considered to enlarge the class of operations to ensure reversible interconversion of entanglement in the asymptotic setting . </S>",
    "<S> a natural candidate is the class of quantum operations that completely preserve positivity of partial transpose ( ppt ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable result is that any state with a nonpositive partial transpose ( npt ) is distillable under this class of operations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the possibility of reversibility under ppt operations and there are examples of mixed states which can be reversibly converted into pure states in the asymptotic setting , e.g. the class of antisymmetric states of arbitrary dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the reversibility under ppt operations remained unknown so far since there were no further examples . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a reversible theory of entanglement considering all asymptotically non - entangling transformations was studied in refs . @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> the unique entanglement measure is identified as the asymptotic ( regularized ) relative entropy of entanglement . a more general reversible framework for quantum resource theories </S>",
    "<S> was introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when the pure entanglement is set to be the standard @xmath2 maximally entangled state , two fundamental ways of entanglement manipulation are well known , namely , entanglement distillation and entanglement dilution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these two tasks also naturally raise two fundamental entanglement measures of distillable entanglement @xmath3 and entanglement cost @xmath4 @xcite . to be specific , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is the highest rate at which one can obtain @xmath2 maximally entangled states from the given state by locc @xcite while @xmath4 is the optimal rate for converting @xmath2 maximally entangled states to the given state by locc . </S>",
    "<S> then the problem of the reversibility in entanglement manipulation under ppt operations is to determine whether distillable entanglement always coincides with entanglement cost under ppt operations . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is very difficult since for general mixed states it is highly nontrivial to evaluate these two measures both of which are given by a limiting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> note that ppt bound entanglement is not a candidate for irreversibility anymore since it can be used as free resources under ppt operations .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that irreversibility still exists in the asymptotic entanglement manipulation under ppt operations , which resolves a major open problem in quantum information theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to show a gap between the regularized rains bound and the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement with respect to ppt states , which also resolves another open problem in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . to be specific , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an additive semidefinite programming ( sdp ) @xcite lower bound for the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement with respect to ppt states and compare it to the rains bound . with this </S>",
    "<S> new lower bound , we are able to show that the ppt - assisted entanglement cost of any rank - two state supporting on the @xmath0 antisymmetric subspace is exactly one entanglement bit ( ebit ) while its ppt distillable entanglement is strictly smaller than one ebit . as an immediate corollary , we show that there is no unique entanglement measure under ppt operations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give a sufficient condition which can be used to efficiently verify the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under ppt operations . </S>",
    "<S> then a more general class of sates can be constructed to further illustrate the irreversibility .    </S>",

    "<S> the operator norm @xmath14 is defined as the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath15 . a deterministic quantum operation ( quantum channel ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 from @xmath6 to @xmath7 is simply a completely positive and trace - preserving ( cptp ) linear map from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the choi - jamiokowski matrix of @xmath16 is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are orthonormal basis on isomorphic hilbert spaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a positive semidefinite operator @xmath22 is said to be ppt if @xmath23 , where @xmath24 means the partial transpose over the system @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> a bipartite operation is said to be a ppt operation if its choi - jamiokowski matrix is ppt . </S>",
    "<S> a well known fact is that the classes of ppt operations , separable operations ( sep ) @xcite and locc obey the following strict inclusions @xcite , @xmath26    let @xmath27 represent one of . </S>",
    "<S> then the concise definitions of distillable entanglement and entanglement cost by the class of @xmath27 operations can be given as follows @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the standard @xmath30 maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we denote @xmath31 and @xmath32 as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , hayden , horodecki and terhal proved that @xmath34 equals to the regularised entanglement of formation @xmath35 @xcite , the convex roof extension of the entropy of entanglement .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite as the following convex optimization problem : @xmath37 in this formula , @xmath38 denotes the quantum relative entropy , where we take @xmath39 throughout the paper . since rains bound is not additive @xcite , it is necessary to consider the regularized rains bound , i.e. , @xmath40    the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) @xcite with respect to the ppt states is given by @xmath41 and the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement with respect to the ppt states is given by @xmath42    the logarithmic negativity @xcite is an upper bound on ppt - assisted distillable entanglement , i.e. , @xmath43 . </S>",
