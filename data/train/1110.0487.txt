    "optical afterglows of @xmath9-ray bursts ( grbs ) provide a novel alternative for probing the interstellar medium , galactic halos , and intergalactic gas in the distant universe ( e.g.  vreeswijk @xmath102004 ; chen @xmath10  2005a ; prochaska , chen , & bloom 2006 ; vreeswijk @xmath10  2007 ; chen @xmath10  2007a ; fox @xmath10  2008 ; delia @xmath10  2009 ; ledoux @xmath10  2009 ) . because long - duration grbs are believed to originate in the catastrophic death of massive stars ( e.g.  woosley & bloom 2006 ) and because massive stars evolve rapidly ,",
    "these grbs also provide a powerful internal light source for probing young , active star - forming regions well into the epoch of re - ionization ( e.g.wijers @xmath10  1998 ; tanvir @xmath10  2009 ; salvaterra @xmath10  2009 ) . unlike quasars , optical afterglows disappear after a few months and do not hamper follow - up searches for grb host galaxies and other faint galaxies near the afterglow sightlines , allowing direct comparison studies of ism and stellar properties of distant galaxies .",
    "early - time afterglow spectra have revealed numerous absorption features due to resonance and fine - structure transitions that enable accurate measurements of the chemical composition , dust content , and kinematics of both grb host galaxies and intervening galaxies along the lines of sight ( e.g.  savaglio 2006 ; prochaska @xmath10  2007 ) . in particular ,",
    "the absorption - line profiles have routinely shown complex gas kinematics in the grb host environments ( e.g.  prochaska @xmath102008a ) .",
    "the physical origin of the observed large velocity spread is unclear due to unknown emission properties of the host galaxies .",
    "but because of a massive star origin of grb progenitors , a natural explanation for the observed large velocity spread in the gas foreground to the afterglows is starburst driven outflows .",
    "however , constraining the outflow velocity requires knowledge of the systemic velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "here we present results from a pilot program to obtain spectroscopic confirmation of grb host galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "the primary objective is to determine the systemic redshifts of the host galaxies for studying gas flows in the grb host environment . at high redshift ,",
    "prominent ism emission lines , such as [ oii]3728 , h@xmath124862 , and h@xmath136564 , are redshifted into the near - infrared wavelength range at @xmath14 m .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy of faint galaxies is challenging due to numerous strong atmospheric oh lines . to increase the efficiency of the spectroscopic program , we utilize a new near - infrared echellette spectrograph that offers sufficient resolution over a broad wavelength range from @xmath15 m to @xmath16 m for resolving galaxy emission features from oh skylines .",
    "we have selected galaxies in the fields around grb050820a at @xmath0 and grb060418 at @xmath1 for the pilot spectroscopic program . for each grb , multi - epoch optical images of the field are available in the hst data archive that allow a precise and accurate determination ( better than @xmath17 ) of the location of the optical afterglow ( e.g.  chen @xmath10  2009 ; figure 1 ) .",
    "candidate host galaxies have been identified based on their proximity to the afterglow position in the hst images .",

    "second , nearly all of our targeted galaxies are faint and exhibit little / no trace of continuum .",
    "therefore , accurate spectral traces can not be determined using the science exposures alone .    to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we modified a data reduction pipeline that was originally developed by george becker for processing optical echellete spectral frames ( see e.g.  chen @xmath10  2010 ) .",

    "the slit tilt was determined empirically based on the locations of telluric standards along the cross - dispersion direction . a two - dimensional model of the wavelength solution in vacuum units",
    "was then determined using available thar frames and corrected for heliocentric motion .",
    "based on a comparison with oh sky lines , we find that the accuracy of the wavelength solution is better than 1  .    to extract emission - line only spectra , the data reduction pipeline first determines a trace solution across all echellette orders using the telluric standard frames obtained close in time and location to the targeted galaxies .",
    "an offset along the slit is then applied to match the trace to the emission - line features seen in the two - dimensional sky - subtracted frames .",
    "the observed a0v telluric standard were also useful for calibrating the sensitivity functions of individual echellette orders .",
    "we determined the throughput function for each echellette order by calibrating the observed telluric standard to a model a0v spectrum .    to optimize the accuracy of sky - subtraction and the signal - to - noise of the final extracted spectra , we first performed sky subtraction in individual spectral images . next , we registered the sky - subtracted science frames using emission - line features visible in the data and formed a stacked two - dimensional spectral image for each targeted galaxy .",

    ", the majority of the absorbing clouds , including the gas at @xmath7 pc from the grb afterglow , are observed to be redshifted from both galaxies @xmath28 and @xmath27 at projected distances @xmath112 kpc away . in the case of grb060418",
    ", the majority of the absorbing clouds are also found to be redshifted from galaxy @xmath32 at merely @xmath109 kpc away .",
    "the neutral gaseous clouds at @xmath113 pc from the grb progenitor coincide with the systemic velocity of @xmath30 at @xmath110 kpc away , nearly @xmath108 the projected distance of @xmath32 .    in both cases ,",
    "the grb did not occur in the brightest regions of their host galaxies ( cf .",
    "fruchter @xmath10  2006 ) .",
    "instead , they were either in the outskirts of a compact star - forming galaxy or in a low surface brightness satellite .",
    "if they were in the outskirts of one of the interacting galaxies , then the lack of blueshifted absorbing components relative to the systemic velocities of the galaxies makes it difficult to attribute the observed complex gas kinematics along the afterglow sightline to galactic - scale outflows from the interacting galaxies .",
    "we note that although blueshifted absorbing components are seen relative to @xmath32 along the grb060418 sightline , the hst images clearly show a spatial offset between the grb event and the interacting members @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "different from the self - absorption seen in distant star - forming galaxies ( e.g.  weiner @xmath10  2009 ) , the grb sightline does not probe directly into the compact star - forming regions . while outflows from galaxies @xmath30 and @xmath32 may contribute to some of the absorption components at the blue end , outflows alone",
    "is difficult to explain the edge - leading absorption signatures along the afterglow sightline ( figure 5 ) . to understand the origin of the observed gas kinematics , we continue the discussion assuming that the grbs occurred in a nearby dwarf satellite of the spectrocopically identified interacting galaxies .",
    "we focus on grb050820a as an example but the same scenario can be applied to explain the observations of grb060418 .",
    "we illustrate the relative alignment in the cartoon shown in figure 6 .",
    "we consider scenarios in which the interacting galaxies are either in the background or foreground of the host star - forming region .",
    "if the grb arises in a satellite ( @xmath114 shown in grey in figure 6 ) in front of the interacting galaxies , then the observed redshifted motion of the host ism relative to galaxies @xmath28 and @xmath27 suggests that the host satellite galaxy is falling toward the interacting galaxies . in this scenario , the grb sightline does not probe the ism of either galaxy @xmath28 or @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the large velocity spread of @xmath115 @xmath4observed in the afterglow spectrum can only be explained by possible turbulence in the local star - forming ism ( including supernova driven outflows , if present ) adjacent to birth site of the grb progenitor and by halo gas .",
    "if the host star - forming region is behind the interacting galaxies , then the observed redshifted motion of the host ism suggests that the grb arises in a tidal dwarf galaxy ( @xmath114 shown in dark in figure 6 ) escaping galaxy @xmath27 as galaxies @xmath28 and @xmath27 interact with each other .",
    "a local example of such system is arp 245 ( duc @xmath10  2000 ) .",
    "the large velocity spread of absorbing clouds in the afterglow spectrum can therefore be accounted for by a collective velocity field of the gas local to the star - forming region where the grb progenitor formed , the ism of the interacting galaxies , tidal debris , and accreted halo gas . the lack of absorption systems blueshifted from galaxies @xmath28 and @xmath27 along the grb sightline also constrains the extent of outflows at @xmath116 kpc from galaxy @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .     and @xmath27 to explain the observed line - of - sight velocity distribution of the absorbing gas shown in the bottom panel .",
    "if the grb arises in a satellite ( @xmath114 shown in grey ) in front of the interacting galaxies , then the observed redshifted motion of the host ism relative to galaxies @xmath28 and @xmath27 suggests that the host satellite galaxy is falling toward the interacting galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "the grb sightline does not probe the ism of either galaxy @xmath28 or @xmath27 , but only the local star - forming ism of the grb progenitor and halo gas .",

    "the star - forming region local to the grb progenitor , the ism of the interacting galaxies , tidal debris , and accreted halo gas are all expected to contribute to the absorption features in the afterglow spectra . ]",
    "near - infrared echellette spectra presented here have allowed us to go beyond a spectroscopic confirmation of two @xmath11 grb host galaxies and obtain an accurate and precise measurement of the systemic redshifts of the host galaxies for studying gas flows in the grb host environment .",
    "we find that the hosts of grb050820a and grb060418 share three common features .",
    "first , both grbs are found to originate in a dynamic environment of interacting galaxies separated by @xmath117 kpc in projected distances and @xmath3 @xmath4  in line - of - sight velocity separation .",
    "we have interpreted the high surface brightness star - forming regions as merging galaxies based primarily on the optical morphologies ( figure 1 ) .",
    "while it is also possible that these compact sources are star - forming regions within the same galaxy , we consider this an unlikely scenario given the observed morphologies and the projected separations of @xmath118 or @xmath119 kpc .",
    "previous studies based on deep hst images have shown that star - forming galaxies at @xmath120 have on - average half - light radii of @xmath121 ( e.g.  bouwens @xmath10  2004 ) or @xmath122 kpc ( e.g.ralfeski @xmath10  2011 ; law @xmath10  2011 ) . under a single object scenario ,",
    "the projected distances observed between @xmath28 and @xmath27 around grb050820a or between @xmath30 and @xmath32 around grb060418 would imply a galaxy that is at least five times the typical size of @xmath123 galaxies .",
    "the optical morphologies of the host galaxies of grb050820a and grb060418 resemble the hosts of grb000926 at @xmath20 and grb011211 at @xmath21 , displaying a similarly disturbed morphology of interacting objects .",
    "together they show that a large fraction ( 4/10 ) of known grb host galaxies at @xmath11 ( kulkarni @xmath101998 ; jensen @xmath10  2001 ; fynbo @xmath10  2002 ; fynbo @xmath10  2005 ; vreeswijk @xmath10  2004 , 2006 ; chen @xmath10  2009 , 2010 ) may arise in interacting galaxies .",
    "superstar clusters are commonly seen in interacting galaxies ( e.g.  de grijs @xmath10  2002 ) , which serve as a nature birth place for the progenitors of grbs ( e.g.  chen @xmath102007b ) .",
    "second , the majority of the absorbing gaseous clouds observed in the early - time afterglow spectra , including the gas producing fine - structure absorption lines at @xmath7 pc from the grb afterglow , are found to be redshifted from the interacting galaxies .",
    "this is different from what is seen in the host of grb021004 at @xmath22 , for which all of the absorbing gaseous clouds observed in the early - time afterglow spectra are found to be blueshifted from the systemic velocity of the host galaxy over the range of @xmath124 @xmath4 . at low redshifts ,",
    "such kinematic study is known only for the host of grb030329 at @xmath125 , which shows absorption components primarily blueshifted from the systemic velocity up to @xmath126 @xmath4  ( thne @xmath10  2007 ) .",
    "recall that grb afterglows serve as an internal light of the host galaxies .",
    "the predominantly redshifted motion found for the gas in front of grb050820a and grb060418 therefore suggests inflows .",
    "likewise , the observed blueshifted motion in grb021004 and grb030329 suggests outflows .",
    "the mixture of blueshifted and redshifted gas on velocity scales greater than 200 @xmath4  in front of the grb progenitor site underscores the complex and turbulent gas inflows and outflows around distant young star - forming galaxies ( e.g.  haehnelt @xmath10  1998 ; agertz @xmath102009 ) .",
    "this is different from a more organized rotational motion seen in some damped  absorbing galaxies ( chen @xmath10  2005b ) .",
    "finally , grb050820a and grb060418 did not occur in the brightest star - forming regions of their host galaxies like grb000926 , grb011211 , or other long - duration bursts ( cf .",
    "fruchter @xmath102006 ) .",
    "in contrast , the closest , high surface brightness star - forming region is found to be at least @xmath127 kpc ( or @xmath6 ) away , roughly three times the median projected offset found for long - duration grbs ( e.g.  bloom @xmath10  2002 ) .",
    "this spatial offset and the lack of blueshifted absorbing systems relatively to the star - forming members suggest that the grb event occurred in a low surface brightness tidal tail or satellite .",
    "if grb050820a arises in a tidal tail of galaxy @xmath27 as galaxies @xmath28 and @xmath27 approach each other ( figure 6 ) , then the observed strength and velocity offset of the nv1238 , 1242 absorption doublets can be naturally explained by the conduction interface of stripped gas ( e.g.  indebetouw & shull 2004 ) from the interacting galaxies ( cf .",
    "prochaska @xmath10  2008b ) .",
    "in addition , satellite galaxies or tidal tails contain relatively more pristine gas around otherwise chemically evolved star - forming galaxies ( e.g.  thilker @xmath10  2009 ) .",
    "the broad range of galactic environement probed by grb events , from the luminous host example of grb021004 to possible faint dwarf satellites for the hosts of grb050820 and grb060418 , is qualitatively consistent with the large scatter observed in the ism metallicity of grb host galaxies .",
    "( e.g.  savaglio 2010 ) .",
    "the large velocity spread and low metallicity expected in tidal tails may also explain the large scatters seen in the velocity  metallicity correlation ( prochaska @xmath10  2008a ; ledoux @xmath10  2006 ) .    in summary , we show that comparisons of the systemic redshifts of the host galaxies and the velocity distribution of absorbing clouds revealed in early - time afterglow spectra provide new insights into the nature of grb host galaxies and their environments .",
    "galactic - scale winds are not the only factor that drives the observed large velocity spread of gaseous clouds along grb sightlines .",
    "four of 10 grb hosts known at @xmath11 exhibit similar morphologies showing interacting galaxies .",
    "galaxy interactions can be effective in producing chemically enriched materials away from more concentrated star - forming regions found in deep galaxy surveys .",
    "lastly , we also note that the absorbing galaxies responsible for the two strong mgii absorbers at @xmath64 ( @xmath66  ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath67  ) remain missing around the sightline toward grb050820a .",
    "no galaxies brighter than @xmath128 ( over a @xmath35 diameter aperture ) are seen at @xmath129 of the afterglow sightline in late - time hst acs images .",
    "either the absorbing galaxies are extremely faint @xmath130 , or we are seeing a large collection of absorbing clouds at projected distance @xmath131 kpc from a star - forming galaxy .",
