    "scientific investigation of the electromagnetic field generated by a charged particle that moves faster than light began with a largely ignored article by physicist and mathematician oliver heaviside in 1887 @xcite and is the subject of several papers by sommerfeld in 1904 and early 1905 @xcite .",
    "the publication of the special theory of relativity in june 1905 @xcite , however , discouraged further work as one of its tenets is , of course , that any known particle that has a charge also has a rest mass and so is barred from moving faster than light . moreover , no source that moves faster than the wave speed can be pointlike , for this results in infinitely strong fields on the envelope of the emitted wave fronts .",
    "it was not until the early 1970s that bolotovskii and ginzburg @xcite pointed out that although special relativity precludes massive particles from moving superluminally , patterns of distribution of extended sources can move faster than light as a result of the coordinated motion of their constituent charged particles , which themselves remain subluminal @xcite .",
    "the charge separation resulting from such coordinated motion gives rise to a polarization current whose distribution pattern can move faster than light _ in vacuo . _ the way in which this current acts as a source of radiation is immediately apparent from the ampre - maxwell equation ( si units ) , @xmath4 in which we see that the polarization current @xmath5 contributes to the magnetic field @xmath6 in just the same way as the current @xmath7 of free charges .",
    "however , as @xmath8 is not carried by massive particles , it is not limited to subluminal speeds .",
    "we should clarify that while the source distribution is superluminal , the emitted radiation ( as any other ) travels _ at _ the speed of light .",
    "extended sources of electromagnetic radiation whose distribution patterns move faster than light _ in vacuo _ have been experimentally realized by several groups @xcite and have many potential applications in science and technology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they may be responsible for the extreme properties of the electromagnetic radiation received from astronomical objects such as pulsars ( rapidly spinning , highly magnetized neutron stars ) @xcite .",
    "methods of dealing with the asymptotic behavior of the radiation emitted by such sources , however , are largely neglected in standard texts @xcite .",
    "more dangerously , certain textbook formul , derived in the context of stationary or subluminally moving sources , can not be used in treating unusual cases such as those in which the radiation remains focused in the far zone @xcite .",
    "an example is this expression for the far - zone magnetic field of a localized current with the density @xmath9 : @xmath10}{\\left|{\\mathbf{x}}{_{\\ensuremath{{\\rm p}}}}-{\\mathbf{x}}\\right|}. \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the space - time coordinates of the observation point and the source points , respectively , and the square brackets denote the retarded value of @xmath13 .",
    "( note that , in contrast to the free - charge current @xmath7 of eq .",
    ", this @xmath9 is a generalized current that also includes @xmath14 . )",
    "the derivation of eq .",
    "involves the neglect , in the far zone , of a boundary term containing the gradient of the radiation field . in the case of a conventional source",
    ", this term decays more rapidly with distance than the integral that remains in eq .  .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the radiation field of a polarization current whose distribution pattern has an accelerated motion with a speed exceeding that of light , @xmath15 @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we describe such a source , the emission from which consists of a collection of narrowing subbeams for which the absolute value of the gradient of the radiation field @xmath16 _ increases _ ( as @xmath17 ) with the distance @xmath18 from its source .    since the exact form of eq",
    ".   entails an additional boundary term that depends on the gradient of the field in the far zone [ eq .  ,",
    "below ] , the increase in the magnitude of the gradient of the present radiation field with distance renders the boundary term in the retarded solution of maxwell s equation for @xmath16 dominant over its source term .",
    "the inadequacy of eq",
    ".   in describing the radiation field generated by a superluminal source lies in the neglect of this boundary term .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii describes the superluminally - rotating source distribution , and a practical experimental realization of such a source . in order to make the later discussion more comprehensible",
    ", section iii considers a small volume element of this source and discusses the superposition of multiple retarded times that render the field of a point source divergent .",
    "section  iv generalizes this discussion to an extended source and describes the morphology of the resulting radiation `` beam '' , providing a geometrical argument as to why the boundary term missing from eq .",
    "2 dominates in the far field , and section  v describes supporting experimental data .",
    "sections vi and vii contain the main , substantive point of the current work ; while the boundary contribution to the retarded solution for the potential can always be rendered equal to zero by means of a gauge transformation , the boundary contribution to the retarded solution of the wave equation governing the field can not be neglected in the case of a superluminal source .",
    "finally section viii gives a brief summary .",
    "here we consider a particular moving source distribution for which eq",
    ".   is not an adequate description of the radiation field in the far zone and its experimental realization .",
    "the findings of refs .",
    "[ ] fully clarify how this case should be treated in order to obtain results consistent with experimental data . in these papers",
    ", we solved the inhomogeneous wave equation governing the electromagnetic potential [ eq .",

    "this is a generic source : one can construct any distribution with a uniformly rotating pattern , @xmath33 , by the superposition over @xmath28 of terms of the form @xmath34 .",
    "for example , the polarization - current patterns responsible for the pulsar radiation visible from earth are thought to be animated by the superluminal rotation of the neutron - star core s intense magnetic field through the pulsar s plasma atmosphere  @xcite ; one can envisage representing this rotating pattern by summing such terms .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( 3 )   corresponds to a laboratory - based source that has been used in experimental demonstrations of some of the phenomena described below @xcite .",
    "the experimental apparatus in question ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) consists of a continuous strip of dielectric material on top of which is placed an array of metal electrodes ; underneath is a continuous ground plate .",
    "each upper electrode is connected to an individual amplifier , so that by turning the amplifiers on and off in sequence one can apply voltages that generate a polarized region that moves along the dielectric with an arbitrarily high speed . in practice , the dielectric is a strip of alumina 10  mm thick and 50  mm across , corresponding to a 10@xmath35 arc of a circle of average radius 10.025  m. above the alumina strip , there are 41 upper electrodes of mean width 42.6  mm , with centers 44.6  mm apart @xcite .",
    "the voltage @xmath36 applied to the @xmath37th electrode is of the form @xmath38\\cos(\\omega t ) , \\label{e13}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath25 are as defined in eq .  :",
    "the first cosine gives rise to the polarization - current wave that propagates along the dielectric and the second to a modulation of this wave .",
    "the source speed @xmath40 is determined by the phase difference between the oscillations of neighboring electrodes ; given the dimensions of the electrodes of the experimental machine , a superluminal speed @xmath41 is obtained for @xmath42  ps . in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "[ ] , @xmath43 and @xmath44 had the values 552.645 mhz and 46.042 mhz , respectively , and the source was run at @xmath45 , 1.064 , 1.25 and 2.00 ( see refs .",
    "[ ] for a more complete description ) .",
    "a superluminal source is necessarily volume - distributed @xcite .",
    "however , its field can be built up from the superposition of the fields of its small , moving constituent volume elements .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows that the waves generated by such a volume element of a rotating superluminal source possess a cusped envelope and that , inside the envelope , _ three _ wave fronts pass through any given observation point simultaneously .",
    "this reflects the fact that the field inside the envelope receives simultaneous contributions from three distinct values of the retarded time [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ] . on the cusp of the envelope , where the space - time trajectory of the source is tangent to the past light cone of the observer [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ] , all three contributions toward the value of the field coalesce  @xcite .        on this",
    "cusp ( caustic ) , the source approaches the observer with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time , i.e.  @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the distance between the source point @xmath49 and the observation point @xmath50 . as a result , the interval of emission time for the signal carried by the cusp is much longer than the interval of its reception time  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1](d ) represents this diagrammatically ; rather than merely intersecting at one or three points , the space - time trajectory of the source and the observer s light cone become tangent to one another .",
    "this essentially instantaneous reception of contributions from an extended period of emission time represents focusing of the radiation in the time domain ; it has been described as _ temporal focusing _ and is the subject of two experimental papers  @xcite .",
    "it is this temporal focusing that leads to the divergence of the field of a point source on the cusp of the envelope of wave fronts and is ultimately responsible for the component of the radiation from an extended source whose intensity decays as 1/distance , rather than the inverse square law that applies to all other sources  @xcite ; consequently , this part of the radiation will dominate in observations made from large distances .    a three - dimensional view of the envelope of wave fronts and its cusp is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the two sheets of the envelope , and the cusp along which these two sheets meet tangentially , spiral outward into the far zone . in the far zone ,",
    "the cusp lies on the double cone @xmath51 $ ] , @xmath52 $ ] , where @xmath53 denote the spherical polar coordinates of the observation point p. thus , a stationary observer in the polar interval @xmath54\\le\\theta{_{\\ensuremath{{\\rm p}}}}\\le\\pi-\\arcsin[c/(r\\omega)]$ ] receives recurring pulses from each volume element as the envelope rotates past him / her  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the radiation field generated by the rotating source element @xmath55 on a cone close to the cusp , just outside the envelope .",
    "not only does the spiraling cusp embody a recurring pulse , but the plane of polarization of the radiation swings across the pulse  @xcite , as does the radio emission received from pulsars  @xcite .     outside the envelope of wave fronts for a source element with @xmath56 . here",
    ", the field vectors are projected onto the plane @xmath57 of the source s orbit.,height=302 ]",
    "the dominant contribution towards the field of an extended source comes from a thin filamentary part of the source that approaches the observer , along the radiation direction , with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time  @xcite . for an observation point",
    "p in the far zone with the coordinates @xmath58 , this filament is located at @xmath59 , @xmath60 and is essentially parallel to the rotation axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the collection of cusps of the envelopes of wave fronts that emanate from various volume elements of the contributing filament form a subbeam whose polar width is nondiffracting : the linear dimension of this bundle of cusps in the direction parallel to the rotation axis remains the same at all distances from the source , so that the polar angle @xmath61 subtended by the subbeam decreases as @xmath62 with increasing @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and  ref .",
    "[ ] ) .    in that it consists of caustics and so is constantly dispersed and reconstructed out of other waves , the subbeam in question radically differs from a conventional radiation beam ( see appendix d of ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "the narrowing of its polar width ( as @xmath62 ) is accompanied by a more slowly diminishing intensity ( an intensity that diminishes as @xmath62 instead of @xmath63 with distance ) , so that the flux of energy across its cross sectional area remains the same for all @xmath18  @xcite . as we will see in the next section",
    ", this slower rate of decay of the emission from a superluminally rotating source has been confirmed experimentally upto several hundred fresnel distances ( rayleigh ranges )  @xcite .    , the filamentary part of the source that approaches the observation point with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time , the orbit @xmath64 of this filamentary source , and the subbeam formed by the bundle of cusps that emanate from the constituent volume elements of this filament.,height=264 ]    the contributing part of an extended source ( the filament that approaches the observation point with the speed of light and zero acceleration ) changes as the source rotates ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) . in the case of a turbulent plasma with a superluminally rotating macroscopic distribution ,",
    "therefore , the overall beam within which the narrow , nonspherically decaying radiation is detectable would consist of an incoherent superposition of coherent , nondiffracting subbeams with widely differing amplitudes and phases ( similar to the train of giant pulses received from the crab pulsar @xcite ) .",
    "the overall beam occupies a solid angle whose polar and azimuthal extents are independent of the distance @xmath18 .",
    "it is detectable within the polar interval @xmath65\\le\\vert\\theta{_{\\ensuremath{{\\rm p}}}}-\\pi/2\\vert \\le\\arccos[(r_u\\omega / c)^{-1}]$ ] , where @xmath66 $ ] denotes the radial extent of the superluminal part of the source .",
    "the azimuthal profile of this overall beam reflects the distribution of the source density around the cylinder @xmath64 , from which the dominant contribution to the radiation arises  @xcite .    because the subbeams that constitute the overall beam are narrower the farther away from the source they are detected , the absolute value of the gradient of the radiation field associated with them _ increases _ with distance : it has been explicitly shown in ref .",

    "derivatives of the integral representing the retarded potential are well - defined only as generalized functions @xcite .",
    "we must stress that we have not calculated the radiation field directly from the solution to the wave equation governing the field ( the solution whose boundary term is normally neglected @xcite ) .",
    "we have instead first solved the wave equation governing the potential ( whose solution has no boundary term ) and then used this solution to evaluate the neglected term in the exact version of the retarded solution for the field [ eq .  ] .",
    "what one obtains by including the boundary term in the retarded solution to the wave equation governing the field is merely a mathematical identity ; it is not a solution that could be used to calculate the field arising from a given source distribution in free space .",
    "unless its boundary term happens to be small enough relative to its source term to be neglected , a condition that can not be known _ a priori _ , the solution in question would require that one prescribe the field in the radiation zone ( _ i.e. ,  _ what one is seeking ) as a boundary condition .",
    "thus , the role of the classical expression for the retarded potential in radiation theory is much more fundamental than that of the corresponding retarded solution of the wave equation governing the field .",
