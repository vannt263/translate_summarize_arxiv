    "rational algebraic curves and surfaces can be described in several different ways , the most common being parametric and implicit representations .",
    "parametric representations describe the geometric object as the image of a rational map , whereas implicit representations describe it as the set of points verifying a certain algebraic condition , e.g. as the zeros of a polynomial equation .",
    "both representations have a wide range of applications in computer aided geometric design ( cagd ) , and depending on the problem one needs to solve , one or the other might be better suited . to give a simple example , the parametric description is better for drawing a surface , as it allows to rapidly generate points on the surface , which can then be interpolated , whereas an implicit representation is better adapted for testing if a given point lies on the surface , since one only needs to check whether the point verifies the algebraic condition that defines the surface .",
    "it is thus interesting to be able to pass from the parametric representation to the implicit equation .",
    "this is a classical problem and there are numerous approaches to its solution , see @xcite and @xcite for good historical overviews .",
    "however , it turns out that the implicitization problem is computationally difficult . a promising alternative suggested in @xcite is to compute a so - called _ matrix representation _ instead , which is easier to compute but still shares some of the advantages of the implicit equation .",
    "here is the definition .",
    "let @xmath4 be a hypersurface .",
    "a matrix @xmath5 with entries in the polynomial ring @xmath6 $ ] is called a _ representation matrix _ of @xmath7 if it is generically of full rank and if the rank of @xmath5 evaluated in a point of @xmath8 drops if and only if the point lies on @xmath7 .",
    "it follows immediately that a matrix @xmath5 represents @xmath7 if and only if the greatest common divisor of all its minors of maximal size is a power of the homogeneous implicit equation @xmath9 $ ] of @xmath7",
    ". one major ingredient in the construction of such matrices are syzygies .",
    "the theory of syzygies has been developed in the theoretical context of commutative algebra at the beginning of the 20th century by mathematicians such as david hilbert .",
    "however , it was only in the 1990s that the cagd and geometric modeling community discovered that the concept of syzygies is useful in their field .",
    "initially unaware of the connections to commutative algebra , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and numerous other authors labeled this approach the method of `` moving curves '' ( or `` moving surfaces '' ) and showed how it can be used to express the implicit equation as a determinant .",
    "in the case of a planar rational curve @xmath10 given by a parametrization of the form @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 $ ] are coprime polynomials of degree @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a field , a linear syzygy ( or moving line ) is a linear relation on the polynomials @xmath16 , i.e. a linear form @xmath17 in the variables @xmath18 and with polynomial coefficients @xmath19 $ ] such that @xmath20 .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the set of all those linear syzygies forms and for any integer @xmath22 the graded part @xmath23 of syzygies of degree at most @xmath22 .",
    "actually , to be precise , one should homogenize the @xmath24 with respect to a new variable and consider @xmath21 as a graded module here .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath23 is a finite - dimensional @xmath15-vector space and one can easily obtain a basis @xmath25 by solving a linear system .",
    "we define the matrix @xmath26 of coefficients of the @xmath27 with respect to a @xmath15-basis of @xmath28_\\nu$ ] as @xmath29 that is , the coefficients of the syzygies @xmath27 form the columns of the matrix .",
    "note that the entries of this matrix are linear forms in the variables @xmath30 with coefficients in the field @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the homogeneous implicit equation of the curve and @xmath32 the degree of the parametrization as a rational map .",
    "intuitively , @xmath32 measures how many times the curve is traced .",
    "it is known that for @xmath33 , the matrix @xmath26 is a representation matrix ; more precisely : if @xmath34 , then @xmath26 is a square matrix , such that @xmath35 .",
    "also , if @xmath36 , then @xmath26 is a non - square matrix with more columns than rows , such that the greatest common divisor of its minors of maximal size equals @xmath37 .    in other words",
    ", one can always represent the curve as a square matrix of linear syzygies . in principle",
    ", one could now actually calculate the implicit equation .",
    "however , it might be advantageous to avoid the costly determinant computation and work directly with the matrix instead , as it has the advantage of making the well - developed theory and tools of linear algebra applicable to solve geometric problems .",
    "for instance , testing whether a point @xmath38 lies on the curve only requires computing the rank of @xmath26 evaluated in @xmath38 .",
    "other interesting results using square matrix representations directly to solve geometric problems are presented , for example , in @xcite or @xcite , in which intersection problems are treated by means of eigenvalue techniques .    it is a natural question whether this kind of matrix representation can be generalized to rational surfaces defined as the image of a map @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] are coprime polynomials of degree @xmath14 . in order to put the problem in the context of graded modules ,",
    "one first has to consider an associated projective map @xmath41 where @xmath1 is a 2-dimensional projective toric variety ( for example @xmath2 or @xmath42 ) with coordinate ring @xmath43 and the @xmath44 are homogenized versions of their affine counterparts @xmath24 . in other words",
    ", @xmath1 is a suitable compactification of the affine space @xmath45 @xcite . in this case ,",
    "a linear syzygy ( or moving plane ) of the parametrization @xmath46 is a linear relation on the @xmath47 , i.e. a linear form @xmath48 in the variables @xmath49 with @xmath50 $ ] such that @xmath51 exactly in the same way as for curves , one can set up the matrix @xmath26 of coefficients of the syzygies in a certain degree @xmath22 , but unlike in the curve case , it is in general not possible to choose a degree @xmath22 such that @xmath26 is a square matrix representation of the surface . in recent years",
    ", two main approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem :    * one allows the use of quadratic syzygies ( or higher - order syzygies ) in addition to the linear syzygies in order to be able to construct square matrices .",
    "* one only uses linear syzygies as in the curve case and obtains non - square representation matrices .    the first approach using linear and quadratic syzygies ( or moving planes and quadrics ) has been treated in @xcite for base - point - free homogeneous parametrizations , i.e. @xmath52 , and @xcite does the same in the presence of base points . in @xcite ,",
    "square matrix representations of bihomogeneous parametrizations , i.e. @xmath3 , are constructed with linear and quadratic syzygies , whereas @xcite gives such a construction for parametrizations over toric varieties of dimension 2 .",
    "the methods using quadratic syzygies usually require additional conditions on the parametrization and the choice of the quadratic syzygies is often not canonical .    the second approach ,",
    "even though it does not produce square matrices , has certain advantages , in particular in the sparse setting that we present . in previous publications ,",
    "this approach with linear syzygies , which relies on the use of the so - called approximation complexes has been developed in the case @xmath52 , see for example @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and in @xcite for bihomogeneous parametrizations of degree @xmath53 .",
    "however , for a given affine parametrization @xmath54 , these two varieties are not necessarily the best choice of a compactification of affine space , since they do not always reflect well the combinatorial structure of the polynomials @xmath55 . in this paper",
    "we will extend the method to a much larger class of varieties , namely toric varieties of dimension 2 , and we will see that this generalization allows us to choose a `` good '' toric compactification of @xmath45 depending on the polynomials @xmath55 , which makes the method applicable in cases where it failed over @xmath2 or @xmath42 and we will also see that it is significantly more efficient and leads to much smaller representation matrices .    the main idea of our method is similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "we use a ( general ) toric embedding to consider our domain as a 2-dimensional toric variety contained in a higher - dimensional projective space , which we present in section  [ sec : setting ] .",
    "contrary to the cited paper , this natural domain will not be in general a hypersurface and its coordinate ring will usually not be gorenstein , which means that we have to give new proofs for some of the results in which this property was used . in section  [ approxt ]",
    "we proceed to establish the necessary homological tools and in particular to derive bounds on local cohomology in theorem  [ locosymalgt ] , our main technical result .",
    "after that , we will see in section  [ sec : equation ] that we can deduce the validity of the approach from previous results to produce an efficient representation matrix for the implicit equation ( see corollary  [ cor : main ] ) .",
    "the particular case of bihomogeneous parametrizations of any bidegree is illustrated in section  [ segret ] .",
    "we then show the advantages of our method through several examples in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "after some concluding remarks which summarize the scope of the paper in section  [ sec : final ] , an implementation in macaulay2 @xcite for the important special case @xmath3 is included as an appendix .",
    "let @xmath15 be a field .",
    "all the varieties considered hereafter are understood to be taken over @xmath15 .",
    "we suppose given a rational map @xmath56 where @xmath40 $ ] are polynomials .",
    "we assume that    * @xmath54 is a generically finite map onto its image and hence parametrizes an irreducible surface @xmath57 * @xmath58 , which means that there are only finitely many base points .",

    "note that our hypothesis that @xmath54 is generically finite implies that @xmath67 is two - dimensional .",

    "in other words , @xmath70 is the smallest possible homothety of @xmath67 with integer vertices .",

    "it is defined as the closed image of the embedding @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",

    "intuitively , the surface @xmath1 should be understood to be the smallest compactification of @xmath45 through which the map @xmath54 factorizes , so in a way it respects the geometry of the map best and is a natural candidate .",
    "however , we will see in example [ interestingexample ] that in some cases there are better choices than the canonical choice @xmath70 .",

    "an example of this is given in the next section .",
    "we first treat some examples from @xcite .",
    "example 10 in the cited paper , which could not be solved in a satisfactory manner in @xcite , is a surface parametrized by @xmath314    the newton polytope @xmath70 of this parametrization is        * *    we can compute the new parametrization over the associated variety , which is given by linear forms @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath315 ( since there is no smaller homothety @xmath70 of @xmath67 ) and the coordinate ring is @xmath316/j$ ] where @xmath275 is generated by @xmath317 binomials of degrees 2 and 3 . recall that the 9 variables correspond to the @xmath318 points in the newton polytope . in the optimal degree @xmath319 as in theorem  [ locosymalgt ] , the implicit equation of degree @xmath320 of the surface @xmath82 is represented by a @xmath321-matrix , compared to a @xmath322-matrix with the toric resultant method ( from which a @xmath323-minor has to be computed ) and a @xmath324-matrix with the method of moving planes and quadrics . note also that this is a major improvement of the method in @xcite , where a @xmath325-matrix representation was computed for the same example .",
    "example 11 of @xcite is similar to example 10 but an additional term is added , which transforms the point @xmath326 into a non - lci base point .",

    "even if we choose the non - optimal bound @xmath340 as given in theorem [ maintht ] , the computation of the @xmath341 representation matrix is computed instantaneously in macaulay2 .",

    ", the computation of the matrix is relatively cheap and the main interest in lowering the bound @xmath247 as much as possible is the reduction of the size of the matrix , not the time of its computation .",
    "this reduction improves the performance of algorithmic applications of our approach , notably to decide whether a given point lies in the parametrized surface .",
    "[ interestingexample ] in the previous example , we did not fully exploit the structure of @xmath67 and chose a bigger polygon for the embedding .",
    "here is an example where this is necessary to represent the implicit equation without extraneous factors .",

    "this is a very sparse parametrization and we have @xmath347 .",
    "the coordinate ring is @xmath348/j$ ] , where @xmath349 and the new base - point - free parametrization @xmath46 is given by @xmath350 .",
    "the newton polytope looks as follows .",
    "* * + @xmath67 * * + * * +    for @xmath351 we can compute the matrix of the first map of @xmath352 , which is a @xmath353-matrix .",
    "the greatest common divisor of the @xmath354-minors of this matrix is the homogeneous implicit equation of the surface ; it is of degree 6 in the variables @xmath49 : @xmath355    as in example [ indegfalse ] we could have considered the parametrization as a bihomogeneous map either of bidegree @xmath356 or of bidegree @xmath357 , i.e. we could have chosen the corresponding rectangles instead of @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to more complicated coordinate rings ( @xmath358 resp .",
    "@xmath359 variables and @xmath360 resp .",
    "@xmath361 generators of @xmath275 ) and to bigger matrices ( of size @xmath362 in both cases ) .",
    "even more importantly , the parametrizations will have a non - lci base point and the matrices do not represent the implicit equation but a multiple of it ( of degree @xmath318 ) . instead , if we consider the map as a homogeneous map of degree @xmath363 , the results are even worse : for @xmath364 , the @xmath365-matrix @xmath366 represents a multiple of the implicit equation of degree @xmath317 .",
    "to sum up , in this example the toric version of the method of approximation complexes works well , whereas it fails over @xmath42 and @xmath2 .",
    "this shows that the extension of the method to toric varieties really is a generalization and makes the method applicable to a larger class of parametrizations .",
    "interestingly , we can even do better than with @xmath67 by choosing a smaller polytope .",
    "the philosophy is that the choice of the optimal polytope is a compromise between two criteria :    * the polytope should be as simple as possible in order to avoid that the ring @xmath43 becomes too complicated .",
    "* the polytope should respect the sparseness of the parametrization ( i.e. be close to the newton polytope ) so that no base points appear which are not local complete intersections .",
    "so let us repeat the same example with another polytope @xmath90 , which is small enough to reduce the size of the matrix but which only adds well - behaved ( i.e. local complete intersection ) base points :        the newton polytope @xmath67 is contained in @xmath367 , so the parametrization will factor through the toric variety associated to @xmath90 , more precisely we obtain a new parametrization defined by @xmath368 over the coordinate ring @xmath369/j$ ] with @xmath370 .",
    "the optimal bound is @xmath371 and in this degree the implicit equation is represented directly without extraneous factors by a @xmath372-matrix , which is smaller than the @xmath353 we had before .    as we have seen , the size of the matrix representation depends on the given parametrization and as a preconditioning step it is often advantageous to choose a simpler parametrization of the same surface , if that is possible .",
    "for example , approaches such as @xcite can be used to find a simpler reparametrization of the given surface and optimize the presented methods .",
    "another important factor to consider is that all the methods we have seen represent the implicit equation to the power of the degree of the parametrization . on one hand ,",
    "it can be seen as an advantage that this piece of geometric information is encoded in the matrix representation , but on the other hand , for certain applications one might be willing to sacrifice the information about the parametric degree in order to obtain smaller matrices .",
    "if this is the case , there exist ( for certain surface parametrizations ) algorithms to compute a proper reparametrization of the surface , e.g. @xcite , and in these cases it is highly advisable to do so before computing the matrix representation , because this will allow us to represent the implicit equation directly instead of one of its powers , and the matrices will be significantly smaller .",
    "let us illustrate this with example 2 from @xcite , which treats a parametrization @xmath54 defined by @xmath373    this is a parametrization of bidegree @xmath374 and its newton polytope is the whole rectangle of length 8 and width 4 , so we can apply the method of approximation complexes for @xmath42 .",
    "we obtain a matrix of size @xmath375 representing @xmath376 , where @xmath377 is the implicit equation and @xmath378 . using the algorithm presented in @xcite",
    "one can compute the following proper reparametrization of the surface @xmath82 : @xmath379 this parametrization of bidegree @xmath380 represents @xmath381 directly by a @xmath382-matrix .",
    "representation matrices can be efficiently constructed by solving a linear system of relatively small size ( in our case @xmath383 equations in @xmath384 variables ) .",
    "this means that their computation is much faster than the computation of the implicit equation and they are thus an interesting alternative as an implicit representation of the surface .    in this paper , we have extended the method of matrix representations by linear syzygies to the case of rational surfaces parametrized over toric varieties ( and in particular to bihomogeneous parametrizations ) .",
    "this generalization provides a better understanding of the method through the use of combinatorial commutative algebra . from a practical point of view",
    ", it is also a major improvement , as it makes the method applicable for a much wider range of parametrizations ( for example , by avoiding unnecessary base points with bad properties ) and leads to significantly smaller representation matrices .",
    "let us sum up the advantages and disadvantages compared to other techniques to compute matrix representations ( e.g. the ones introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "the most important advantages are :    * the method works in a very general setting and makes only minimal assumptions on the parametrization .",
    "in particular , it works well in the presence of base points .",
    "* unlike the method of toric resultants , we do not have to extract a maximal minor of unknown size , since the matrices are generically of full rank . *",
    "the structure of the newton polytope of the parametrization is exploited , so one obtains much better results for sparse parametrizations , both in terms of computation time and in terms of the size of the representation matrix .",
    "moreover , it subsumes the known method of approximation complexes in the case of dense homogeneous parametrizations , in which case the methods coincide .    disadvantages of the method are the following .    * unlike with the toric resultant or the method of moving planes and surfaces , the matrix representations are not square . *",
    "the matrices involved are generally bigger than with the method of moving planes and surfaces .",
    "it is important to remark that those disadvantages are inherent to the choice of the method : a square matrix built from linear syzygies does not exist in general and it is an automatic consequence that if one only uses linear syzygies to construct the matrix , it has to be bigger than a matrix which also uses entries of higher degree .",
    "the choice of the method to use depends very much on the given parametrization and on what one needs to do with the matrix representation .",
    "in this appendix we show how to compute a matrix representation with the method developed in this paper , using the computer algebra system macaulay2 @xcite . as it is probably the most interesting case from a practical point of view , we restrict our computations to bi - homogeneous parametrizations of a certain bi - degree @xmath259",
    ". however , the method is easily adaptable to the toric case , or more precisely to a given fixed newton polytope @xmath67 and , where it is appropriate , we will give hints on what to change in the code .",
