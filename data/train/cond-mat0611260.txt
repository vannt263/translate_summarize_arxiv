    "many ultrathin magnetic films , like e.g. co / cu , co / au , fe / cu , undergo a reorientation transition at a temperature @xmath2 ; for temperatures below @xmath2 the spins align preferentially in a direction perpendicular to the film , while above @xmath2 they align in a magnetized state parallel to the plane of the film  @xcite .",
    "this reorientation transition is due to the competition between the in - plane part of the dipolar interaction and the surface anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the range of temperatures where the magnetization points out of the plane , the competition between exchange and dipolar interaction causes the global magnetization to be effectively zero but instead striped magnetic domain patterns emerge@xcite . in the limit of a monolayer film ,",
    "the following dimensionless ising hamiltonian emerges as a minimal model to describe many of the relevant physical properties of those materials@xcite :",
    "@xmath3    where @xmath1 stands for the ratio between the exchange @xmath4 and the dipolar @xmath5 interactions parameters , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "the first sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbor ising spins @xmath7 in a square lattice and the second one over all distinct pairs of spins of the lattice ( every pair is counted once ) ; @xmath8 is the distance , measured in crystal units , between sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the energy is measured in units of @xmath11 . in spite of intense theoretical work@xcite , there are still many important open questions regarding the critical properties of this model .",
    "a detailed understanding of those critical properties is the cornerstone of the theoretical framework needed to explain complex phenomena in ultrathin magnetic films , such as the recently observed inverse transition in fe on cu films@xcite .    the main difficulties to analyze the critical properties of this model are related to the long range character of the dipolar interactions , which combined with the frustration derived from the competition between interactions , adds to any theoretical approach an extra degree of complexity .",
    "then , even the simplest approach , namely mean field approximation ( mf ) , leads to an infinite number of coupled equations that , except for some particular situations can not be solved exactly .",
    "for instance , in an early work czech and villain@xcite derived an exact expression for the mf critical temperature between the disordered and the modulated ( striped ) phases ; however , for sub  critical temperatures the determination of any property must rely on numerical solutions of the mean field equations or further ansatz has to be introduced@xcite to obtain _ approximated _ solutions of the mf equations .",
    "an example is the temperature dependency of the equilibrium stripe width ; being experimentally accessible@xcite , reliable theoretical predictions of this property could be very important to understand the basic mechanisms behind the complex behavior observed in these materials . though mf is a powerful theoretical tool , it is known that , even when the corresponding equations can be solved exactly , neglecting fluctuations can introduce qualitative changes in the critical behavior .",
    "therefore , it is important to compare mf predictions with those obtained by other methods , in order to establish the limits of validity of the approximation .",
    "a natural way to check the mean field predictions is to contrast them with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "however , the long range order nature of the dipolar interactions makes it very difficult to simulate large system sizes .",
    "the ground state stripe width @xmath12 is the natural length scale in these problems .",
    "hence , in order to avoid strong finite size effects , the simulations must be carried out for system sizes @xmath13 ; this restricts the simulations to situations in which @xmath12 is much smaller than the experimentally observed values ( typical values of the stripe width in fe on cu films , for instance , are of the order@xcite of @xmath14 , which corresponds roughly to @xmath15 lattice constants ) . since the ground state value of @xmath12 increases exponentially with@xcite @xmath1 , the values of @xmath1 available for simulations are about of one order of magnitude smaller then the realistic values .    in this work",
    "we carry out a detailed analysis of the equilibrium phase diagram of this model in the @xmath0 space for low values of @xmath1 , i.e. , for @xmath16 , which corresponds to stripe widths @xmath17 . by extending the czech and villain@xcite mf approach to the low temperature region of the phase diagram , we performed in section [ mean field ] a detailed analysis of the different transition lines between striped states , by solving numerically the mf equations .",
    "those results are compared in section [ mc ] with mc simulations that refine previous results@xcite and extend them to other regions of the phase diagram .",
    "our results show that , at least in the analyzed region of the phase diagram , several discrepancies are observed between both phase diagrams , which are discussed in section [ disc ] .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath18    where    @xmath19    a straightforward way to derive a mean field theory for this hamiltonian is the usage of the variational mf free energy per particle@xcite :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the system size , we have taken @xmath22 and the averages are taken using the independent particle density matrix @xmath23 ; the one particle density matrices are subjected to the constraints :    @xmath24    using the local order parameters @xmath25 as variational parameters we obtain the free energy functional    @xmath26= -\\frac{1}{2\\ , n } \\sum_{i , j } j_{ij } \\ , m_i m_j + \\frac{1}{2 \\beta n } \\sum_i \\left[(1+m_i ) \\ln{(1+m_i ) } + ( 1-m_i ) \\ln{(1-m_i)}\\right ] \\label{fmf}\\ ] ]    minimizing eq.([fmf ] ) respect to the order parameters @xmath25 leads to the set of mf equations    @xmath27    assuming periodic boundary conditions , we introduce the fourier transforms    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the position vector of site @xmath9 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the wave vectors @xmath33 are restricted to the first brillouin zone . expanding the logarithms , eq.([fmf ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath34    which has the form of a landau expansion . from this expression",
    "it is immediate that a second order transition between the disordered phase , @xmath35 @xmath36 , and an ordered phase , with non  zero order parameters , happens at the critical temperature@xcite :    @xmath37    we calculated @xmath38 by solving eq.([tc ] ) numerically .",
    "eqs.([mfeq1 ] ) can now be written as    @xmath39    we analyzed numerically the solutions of eqs.([mfeq2 ] ) for temperatures @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , we analyzed the solutions that share the symmetries of the different ground states , namely , antiferromagnetic and striped solutions .",
    "for @xmath42 the ground state is antiferromagnetic@xcite , while for @xmath43 the ground state is composed by stripes of width @xmath44 . for large values of @xmath1",
    "we have@xcite @xmath45 ; for small values of @xmath1 the equilibrium values of @xmath12 can be easily evaluated numerically by comparing the energies of different striped configurations of increasing finite system sizes ( they converge very quickly ) .",
    "@xmath44 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] , where we see that it attains the asymptotic exponential behavior for rather small values of @xmath1 .    at low but finite temperatures , the local magnetization inside the stripes decrease , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider , for instance , a vertical striped state of width @xmath12 .",
    "we demand the solutions of eqs.([mfeq2 ] ) to satisfy the conditions : @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "this restricts the harmonics in eq.([fourier ] ) to those satisfying @xmath51 , with @xmath52 an integer such that @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath54 we only have @xmath55 ; for @xmath56 we have @xmath57 ; for @xmath58 we have @xmath59 ; etc .",
    "in other words , for a stripe solution of width @xmath12 we have @xmath12 independent complex amplitudes @xmath60 . in order to obtain pure real solutions we must impose @xmath61 . replacing those conditions into eqs.([fourier ] ) and ( [ mfeq2 ] ) leads to a set of @xmath12 non - linear algebraic equations for the amplitudes that can be solved numerically . to solve those equations we must evaluate @xmath62 from eq.([fourierj ] ) .",
    "a suitable approximation for that function is ( see appendix [ appa ] )    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the riemann zeta - function . for the antiferromagnetic solution @xmath65 we have to compute    @xmath66    where the last term is calculated numerically .",
    "we calculated the mf stripe solutions for @xmath67 for a wide range of values of @xmath68 . to discriminate",
    "whether they are actually minima we analyzed the second derivatives of the free energy .",
    "for every value of @xmath12 we first analyzed the stability of the solutions , that is , for every value of @xmath1 we calculated the temperature @xmath69 above which non trivial solutions of the above described type cease to exist . this can be done by linearizing the corresponding set of equations around @xmath70 and demanding the condition of non  trivial solution , i.e. , zero determinant of the linearized equations ; this leads to the expression    @xmath71    the stability lines are shown in fig.[fig2 ] , together with @xmath38 .",
    "it can be seen that for large values of @xmath1 the stability lines accumulate near the order - disorder transition line @xmath38 , implying an increasingly large number of metastable states as @xmath1 increases .",
    "another remarkable fact , is the presence of regions near @xmath38 where no striped solutions exists ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . in those regions",
    "another type solutions appear , which are composed by parallel ferromagnetic stripes of different widths .",
    "we called them hybrid states .",
    "the hybrid states , which we denote by @xmath72 , following the notation of selke and fisher @xcite for the axial next - nearest - neighbor ising model ( annni ) , consists in the periodic repetition of a fundamental pattern composed by @xmath73 stripes of width @xmath74 ( with opposite orientation ) , followed by @xmath75 stripes of width @xmath76 and so on .",
    "the regions where the hybrid states appear are shown in the mf phase diagram presented in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the boundaries between ordered phases ( corresponding to first order transitions ) where determined by comparing the free energies of the different solutions ( striped and hybrid ) using eq.[fmf ] ; they are shown by dashed lines in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "we found that the hybrid states appear through a sort of branching process near the boundary between two stable striped solutions as the temperature approaches @xmath77 from below .",
    "for instance , the transition line between the striped phases @xmath54 and @xmath56 ends in a triple point where a stable phase @xmath78 appears between them ; as we increase @xmath1 the transition line between the striped phase @xmath56 and the hybrid one @xmath78 bifurcates in a new triple point giving rise to the appearance of a @xmath79 phase between the @xmath80 and the @xmath56 and so on ( see inset of fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "as the temperature increases more complicated hybrid states proliferate ( we just show a few of them in fig.[fig3 ] as an example ) , in a completely analogous way as in a related model , namely , the three dimensional ising model with competing short range ferromagnetic interactions and long range coulomb interactions@xcite . the mf phase diagram of that model is very similar to that of the present one , the striped states being replaced by lamellar ones .    finally , we found evidences that the proliferation of hybrid states also happens near the boundary between striped phases with larger widths ( for instance , 3 and 4 ) , but they appear very close to @xmath77 and the computational effort needed to obtain an accurate estimation of the phase boundaries becomes very high .",

    "different parts of the phase diagram of this model were analyzed by different authors using mc numerical simulations , for small values of @xmath1 and small system sizes@xcite . in this section",
    "we extend those results to other parts of the phase diagram and to larger system sizes ( in some cases ) , in order to obtain a complete description of the small-@xmath1 phase diagram that can be compared with the mf phase diagram .",
    "the mc results were obtained using heat bath dynamics on @xmath82 square lattices with periodic boundary conditions ( ewald sums were used to handle it@xcite ) .",
    "we analyzed the equilibrium behavior of different quantities for system sizes running from @xmath83 to @xmath84 ; the maximum size used for each quantity were chosen according to the associated computational effort .",
    "the first quantity we calculated was the order  disorder transition temperature as a function of @xmath1 , which we called @xmath85 ( analog to @xmath38 in the mf case ) .",
    "this quantity was determined by means of the specific heat    @xmath86    where @xmath87 stands for a thermal average . for some values of @xmath1",
    "we also calculated the fourth order cumulant    @xmath88    to characterize the order of the phase transition .    at intermediate high temperatures ( close to the order disorder transition and above it )",
    "this system presents a partially disordered phase with broken orientational order called _",
    "tetragonal liquid_@xcite .",
    "it is characterized by domains of stripes with mutually perpendicular orientations forming a kind of labyrinthine structure . at higher temperatures these domains collapse and",
    "the system crosses over continuously to a completely disordered phase ( paramagnetic ) , without a sharp phase transition between them@xcite .",
    "while the existence of the tetragonal liquid phase has been clearly established by mc simulations , it is completely absent in the mf approximation ( we discuss this point in section [ disc ] ) .",
    "mc simulations also showed recently@xcite that for @xmath89 an intermediate phase with nematic order is present between the tetragonal liquid and the striped phase .",
    "the nematic phase is characterized by positional disorder and long range orientational order and is consistent with one of the two possible scenarios predicted by a continuum approximation for ultrathin magnetic films in refs.@xcite .",
    "the presence of the nematic phase is reflected ( among several manifestations ) in the appearance of two distinct maxima at different temperatures in the specific heat , associated with the stripe ",
    "nematic and the nematic  tetragonal liquid phase transitions respectively . on the other hand",
    ", it was shown that for @xmath90 the specific heat present a unique maximum , consistent with a direct transition from the tetragonal liquid to the striped phase@xcite , suggesting that the nematic phase is only present for some range of values of @xmath1 .",
    "we will call @xmath91 the temperature of the high temperature peak of the specific heat , whenever it presents two peaks , or the temperature of the unique peak if only one is present ( for the system sizes considered and between the precision of the calculation ) . we will call @xmath92 the temperature of the low temperature peak of the specific heat , when it presents two peaks . while the calculation of @xmath91 is relatively easy",
    ", the calculation of @xmath92 is much more complicated and subtle , as it will be discussed below .",
    "@xmath91 was calculated for different values of @xmath93 using the following simulation protocol : for each value of @xmath1 we let first the system thermalize at a high enough temperature ( such that it is in the disordered phase ) during @xmath94 monte carlo steps ( ms ) ; after that , we calculated the specific heat for decreasing temperatures , down to a temperature well below the transition region . for every temperature we took the final configuration of the previous one and discarded the first @xmath95 mcs for thermalization and averaged over @xmath94 mcs",
    "every curve was averaged then over @xmath96 independent runs .",
    "this calculation was performed for system sizes @xmath97 for all the values of @xmath1 , in order to make the finite size bias comparable ( for every value of @xmath1 we choose the closer value of @xmath98 commensurated with the modulation @xmath99 of the corresponding ground state width ) .",
    "the results are shown by triangles joined by a continuous line in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the order of the associated phase transition will be discussed in section [ disc ] .",
    "we next calculated the stability of the striped phases in different parts of the phase diagram .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that the striped phases can remain in a meta - stable state for values of @xmath1 such that the equilibrium ground state width corresponds to a different stripe width .",
    "following the same procedure as in ref.@xcite we analyzed the striped staggered magnetization    @xmath100    where@xcite @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this quantity takes the value one in a completely ordered vertical striped state of width @xmath12 and zero in a disordered state ( paramagnetic , tetragonal or nematic ) .",
    "starting from an initially ordered vertical striped state at zero temperature we increase the temperature up to high temperatures , averaging @xmath103 at every step and using a similar procedure as for the calculation on @xmath91 , but averaging over @xmath104 mcs for every temperature to diminish metastability effects ( see discussion below ) .",

    "we found that the equilibrium phase in those regions is a nematic one , instead of an hybrid state , as in the mf case ( we checked the possible presence of hybrid states in those regions and they always decay after a short time into a nematic one ) .",
    "the nematic phase is characterized by an algebraic decay of the spatial spin - spin correlations in one of the coordinate directions and an exponential decay in the other .",

    "the transition lines were obtained by comparing the free energies of the striped phases of widths @xmath12 and @xmath138 .",
    "the system size was chosen in these calculations to be a multiple of both @xmath99 and @xmath139 . in what follows",
    "we will assume that the free energy of a meta ",
    "stable state can be obtained by following a thermodynamical path ( that is , a close sequence of equilibrated states ) from a thermodynamically stable reference state . to calculate the free energy of a striped phase of width @xmath12 we first computed the internal energy per spin @xmath140 along a quasi - static path from an initially low temperature @xmath141 up to a working temperature @xmath142 keeping @xmath143 constant and taking the initial spin configuration of a given temperature as the final configuration of the previous one ; the value of @xmath143 was chosen well separated from the border value at zero temperature between the striped phases of widths @xmath12 and @xmath138 .",

    "the simulation protocol used to determine @xmath91 is completely unable to detect the low temperature transition at @xmath92 .",
    "this is because free energy barriers associated with both transitions for the system sizes here considered are larger around @xmath92 than around @xmath91 , as was shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "indeed , a rough estimation of the average times needed by the system to jump the free energy barrier between the striped and the nematic phases are of the order of the millions of mc , thus generating a strong meta - stability when the average times are of the order of @xmath94 mcs@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that an accurate estimation of @xmath92 for @xmath89 requires , for every temperature , average times of the order of @xmath159 mcs .",
    "however , we verified that an average time of @xmath160 is enough to determine @xmath92 between the error bars we are using in the present calculation ( although such time scales are not enough to determine the height of the specific heat maximum with precision and therefore to allow a finite size scaling analysis ) . in order to save computational effort , we used the following procedure for fixed values of @xmath1 around the regions of interest : first we ran the same simulation protocol as for @xmath91 down to low temperatures and repeated it for the same parameter values , but heating from a low temperature up to high temperatures and taking as initial configuration the ordered striped state . in both cases we calculated the internal energy @xmath161 along the path .",
    "this allowed us to determine the approximated location of @xmath92 , by looking at the temperature range where the internal energy exhibit meta - stability@xcite .",

    "reliable calculations of @xmath92 for larger values of @xmath1 would require system sizes that are out of the present computational capabilities .",

    "we have presented a detailed calculation of the finite temperature phase diagram of the ising dipolar model in the range @xmath172 , which allow striped ground state configurations of width up to @xmath173 .",
    "we compared the predictions of mf approximation with extensive mc numerical simulations .",
    "although the overall appearance of both phase diagrams looks similar , several differences are remarkable .",
    "the first difference to be noticed is the absence of nematic and tetragonal order in the mf approximation .",
    "this results from the fact that both phases are spatially disordered , which implies that @xmath174 @xmath175 .",
    "the characteristic features of those states , namely , the broken rotational symmetry of the nematic state and the discrete rotational symmetry of the tetragonal state can only be observed when looking at the behavior of the spatial correlations , or equivalently , of the structure factor@xcite eq.([sk ] ) .",
    "since fluctuations are neglected in the mf approximation it follows that @xmath176 and therefore the only possible spatially disordered solution within this approximation is the paramagnetic one . on the other hand ,",
    "the mf approximation presents hybrid states solutions in the regions of the phase diagram where mc predicts only nematic order .",
    "moreover , we verified that hybrid states are unstable in that regions , suggesting that ( in the language of renormalization group ) fluctuations play the role of a relevant scaling field that turns the mf hybrid fixed points unstable towards nematic attractors ( in some sense , the hybrid states could be the closest state to a nematic one that can obtained when fluctuations are neglected ) .",
    "this would be consistent with the fact that fluctuations , when included , can modify the continuous nature mf prediction for the phase transition between the high temperature disordered phase and the low temperature ordered one : hartree approximation applied to the continuous version of hamiltonian ( [ hamilton1 ] ) predicts a fluctuation induced first order transition _ any finite _ value of @xmath1  @xcite , which continuously fades out for increasing values of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in fact , mc simulations show a more complex scenario , where the nature of the order  disorder phase transition at @xmath91 depends on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "rastelli et al have shown that for @xmath177 the transition is indeed continuous and belongs to the universality class of the nearest neighbors ising model@xcite .",
    "they also found a rather clear evidence of a second order transition for @xmath178 , but with an unusual value for the critical exponent @xmath179@xcite .",
    "however , cannas et al have shown that for @xmath90 the system presents a weak first order phase transition@xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with the presence of a second order transition line for small values of @xmath1 , that joins with continuous slope a first order transition line for larger values of @xmath1 at a tricritical point somewhere between @xmath178 and @xmath90 and the unusual critical exponents at @xmath178 is probably due to a crossover effect near the tricritical point .",
    "there are also clear evidences that the transition is first order for @xmath180 ( refs.@xcite ) and @xmath181 ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the behavior of the fourth order cumulant observed in the present work for @xmath166 and @xmath169 is also consistent with a first order transition .",
    "for @xmath118 the results of rastelli et al@xcite appear to suggest that the transition becomes continuous again .",
    "however , this is a matter of debate@xcite and numerical results using a completely different technique@xcite for @xmath182 are also consistent with a first order transition .",
    "we also presented numerical evidences of the presence of an intermediate nematic phase between the disordered and the striped ones in different parts of the phase diagram .",
    "although it seems that the nematic phase is only located near the border lines between striped states , the presence of this phase in other regions in narrow ranges of temperatures can not be excluded and larger system sizes should be required to clarify this .",
    "the existence of both type of scenarios for relatively large values of @xmath1 , namely one direct first order transition from the striped phase to the tetragonal liquid or two phase transitions with an intermediate nematic phase would be in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions based on a continuous approach@xcite .",
    "it is worth mention that abanov et al@xcite conjectured a second order nematic - tetragonal phase transition ; since their whole analysis is based on mean field arguments , the disagreement with the mc results can be understood from the fluctuation - induced nature of the transition ( see the discussion in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "regarding the order of the transition at @xmath183 , the situation is less clear .",
    "cannas et al@xcite have shown for @xmath89 that , even the finite size scaling is consistent with a first order transition , the energy changes continuously at @xmath183 in the thermodynamic limit ; this produces a saturation in the associated specific heat peak , behavior that strongly resembles that observed in a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "that could be indicative of the emergency of smectic order between the nematic and the striped phases for larger system sizes and would be in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions based on a continuous approach@xcite . if that would be the case , probably our calculation of @xmath183 overestimates the true transition temperature , since it is known that the specific heat peak locates above the kt transition temperature@xcite , and therefore the nematic phase would extend in larger regions of the phase diagram .",
    "however , at the present level it is very difficult to improve this estimation due to finite size effects .",
    "finally , we found that , at variance with the mf prediction , up to @xmath184 the transition lines between striped phases are completely vertical , imply temperature independence of the stripe width .",
    "this suggests the existence of some large threshold value of @xmath1 , above which wall fluctuations makes the system to cross over to a `` mean field regime '' , where it starts to exhibit temperature dependency of the stripe width .",
    "fruitful discussions with d. a. stariolo , f. a. tamarit , p. m. gleiser , d. pescia , a. vindigni and o. portmann are acknowledged .",
    "this work was partially supported by grants from conicet ( argentina ) , secyt , universidad nacional de crdoba ( argentina ) and ictp grant net-61 ( italy ) ."
