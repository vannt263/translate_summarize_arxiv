    "modern biology , especially genetics and fmri analysis , has motivated a great deal of theoretical and applied research in detection of local signals in large fields of data .",
    "see , for example , lander and botstein ( 1989 ) , karlin , dembo and kawabata ( 1990 ) , feingold et al .",
    "( 1993 ) worsley ( 1992 ) , siegmund and worsley ( 1995 ) .",
    "typically , the random field representing the data is standardized , say , to have mean zero when there is no signal and to have mean different from zero in neighborhoods of signals .",
    "these signal detection problems are statistically irregular , since the parameters quantifying the magnitude and location of each signal are confounded .    in many formulations the random field",
    "is assumed to be gaussian , often because of arguments based on the central limit theorem .",
    "control for the multiple comparisons involved in searching the field for local signals is achieved by using the theory of maxima of gaussian fields to obtain a significance threshold that controls the overall false positive rate .",
    "this requires that the normal distribution provide an adequate approximation in the extreme tail of the distribution , which in turn suggests that one be skeptical of the accuracy of the resulting thresholds , especially in many cases where poisson like data are involved and the poisson rate is not large .",
    "papers containing more precise asymptotic analyses under various special conditions are rabinowitz and siegmund ( 1995 ) , tang and siegmund ( 2001 ) , peng and siegmund ( 2005 ) , chan and zhang ( 2006 ) , siegmund , yakir and zhang ( 2011 ) .",
    "this paper is motivated by a number of problems arising from high - throughput dna sequencing data , where the random field is assumed to be a poisson process , possibly non - homogeneous , or in some cases a mixture of poisson processes to deal with over - dispersion .",
    "the signal to be detected involves a local change in the rate of the poisson process .",
    "such scans for local signals arise in the detection of dna copy number variations in dna sequencing , transcription factor binding sites in chromatin immuno - precipitation followed by sequencing ( chip - seq , see for example schwarzman et al .",
    "2013 ) , alternative transcription start and end sites in rna sequencing , and genomic insertions and deletions in paired - end dna sequencing .",
    "a brief description of these motivating applications is given in the next section , but our focus will be on the last problem , also referred to as dna structural variant detection . although these problems differ in biological context and model formulation , they can be studied by closely related statistical methods .",
    "we propose a framework for detecting local signals in poisson - like data .",
    "scan statistics for the applications mentioned in the preceding paragraph can be cast in the proposed framework .",
    "we derive approximations for the false positive rates of likelihood ratio- and score - based scan statistics for reasonably general poisson random fields .",
    "we also study the power of these statistics as a function of the baseline rate and other parameters . for the structural variant detection problem ,",
    "we first introduce , as illustration , a toy mixture model that can be directly compared to some simple models for which there is existing theory .",
    "we then consider more complex models that are more carefully tailored to the specific features of paired end reads of dna sequencing data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe some motivating applications in section [ sec : examples ] . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we give a general framework for scans of poisson random fields , first illustrating it on a simple mixture model ( section [ sec : simple ] ) and then on a more complex and realistic model for the problem of structural variant detection ( section [ sec : bettermodel ] ) . the simple mixture model has the benefit of being more transparent and allowing more direct comparisons to some existing scan statistics , while also lending qualitative insights that are transferable to more complex settings . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we describe the procedure for p - value approximation for scan statistics on poisson random fields .",
    "these approximations are derived for the simple mixture model in section 6 , with their accuracy examined by numerical experiments . even for the simple mixture model",
    ", it is not clear how to design the scan statistic with respect to the unknown parameters to maximize power under the different types of alternatives . in section",
    "[ sec : power ] , we explore some of the complicated issues relating to power . in section 7",
    ", we return to the more realistic models for structural variant detection formulated in section [ sec : bettermodel ] .",
    "their p - value approximations are given , the power of various scan regimes under current experimental designs are studied , and and the analysis of a real data set from illumina s platinum genomes is described .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the theory and methods described in this paper are at the core of ` swan ` , a comprehensive statistical pipeline for genomic structural variant detection . `",
    "swan ` is an open source r library available at :    ` https://bitbucket.org/charade/swan/wiki/home ` .",
    "high throughput short read sequencing , often referred to as `` next - generation sequencing , '' is a revolutionary way of quantifying dna , rna , protein binding , and many other genome - wide features in biology .",
    "the series of online supplementary articles of the november 2009 issue of nature provide a good overview of the technology and its applications . as our main example , we consider dna sequencing , which is described in the review by medvedev , stanciu and brudno ( 2009 ) .",
    "briefly , double - stranded dna is extracted from the sample of interest and fragmented , followed by the sequencing of a fixed number of bases , called reads , from one or both ends of each fragment .",
    "the lengths of the fragments are selected to be within a specific range , e.g. 200 bases with a standard deviation of 10 .",
    "when both ends of the fragment are sequenced , the data are referred to as paired ends , since the reads are paired , with one read coming from each end of the double - stranded dna molecule .",
    "since sequencing is unidirectional and proceeds only in the 5 to 3 direction of the dna molecule , one read of each pair should come from the plus strand of each double stranded fragment , with the other read of the pair coming from the minus strand .",
    "the sequenced reads are then mapped to a reference genome , and the start positions , as well as orientation ( plus or negative strand ) of each read are recorded among many other features . in obvious nomenclature , reads that map to the plus and negative strand of the template sequence are called , respectively , `` plus strand reads '' and `` minus strand reads '' .",
    "the mapped insert length is defined as the number of bases between the start position of the minus strand read and that of the plus strand read .",
    "if the sequenced genome is identical to the reference genome in the region spanned by the reads , then the mapped insert length is simply the length of the fragment from which the read pair derived , minus the length of one read , and also , each read pair should consist of one plus strand read and one negative strand read .",
    "important fixed quantities in our ensuing models , which are chosen during the experiment , are the length of each read , @xmath0 , and the distribution of the insert lengths , which we characterize by a distribution function @xmath1 with mean @xmath2 and standard deviation @xmath3 .",
    "in diploid organisms , each cell has 2 copies of every chromosome .",
    "a copy number change refers to the deletion or duplication of a chromosomal segment .",
    "dna sequencing has been used to detect copy number change , because the density of reads mapped to a genome interval depends on the relative quantity of that piece of dna in the sequenced sample ( campbell et al . , 2008 ; chiang et al . , 2009 ; abyzov et al , 2011 ; shen and zhang , 2012 ) .",
    "consider a simplified model for single - end sequencing , where the start positions of the mapped reads can be assumed to follow a non - homogeneous poisson process @xmath4 of intensity @xmath5 .",
    "that is , for @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the number of reads that map to the region @xmath8 $ ] on the reference genome .",
    "we will call @xmath4 the _ coverage process_. the function @xmath5 depends not only on the copy number but also on other features , such as gc content , that are local to the neighborhood of @xmath9 . to control for local biases , shen and zhang ( 2012 ) considered a control process @xmath10 derived from the sequencing of a control sample , and used sequential clustering of jumps in @xmath11 to detect copy number changes . in a region free of cnv ,",
    "the jumps form a symmetric random walk with increments 1 or - 1 , while a clustering of jumps of one kind indicates the presence of cnv . in this way",
    "the detection of cnv is reduced to detection of an interval where a simple symmetric random walk shows an excess of 1 s or -1 s . this problem has been well studied and will not be discussed here , except to note",
    "that knowledge of @xmath5 is unnecessary , since information about the proximity in base pairs of one jump from another is ignored by this statistic .",
    "considerable effort has been made to estimate @xmath5 using measurable genomic features such as gc content and mappability ( see , for example , benjamini and speed , 2012 ) .",
    "assuming that a reliable estimate of @xmath5 is available , we can model a deletion of @xmath12 $ ] as a drop of the intensity function to @xmath13 within the interval , where @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 reflects whether the deletion is heterozygous or homozygous , and the purity of the deletion in the sample . the log likelihood ratio for the process @xmath16 , with and without the deletion is @xmath17   - [ \\exp(\\beta ) -1 ] \\int_{t_1-r}^{t_2 } \\rho(t ) dt.\\ ] ]",
    "since the boundaries of the deletion are unknown , a scan statistic would involve maximization of ( [ deletion ] ) over an appropriate range of @xmath18 , and perhaps also over a reasonable range for @xmath19 this model can obviously also be used to detect duplications .",
    "structural variants are insertions , deletions , inversions , and translocations of segments of dna in the genome .",
    "deletions result in a loss of copy number , and insertions of dna from another region of the genome result in a copy number gain of that region .",
    "thus , structural variation sometimes cause copy number variation , but not always . for example",
    ", a translocation , which is the movement of a dna segment from one position in the genome to another , does not result in a change of copy number , but can be viewed as a deletion at the original site followed by an insertion at the new site .",
    "structural variants are always parameterized with respect to the reference genome template to which reads are mapped , and thus , for example , deletion of @xmath20 $ ] refers to deletion of the dna sequence starting at @xmath21 and ending at @xmath9 in the reference genome .",
    "paired - end dna sequencing allows the detection and sometimes the precise positioning of structural variants .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] shows how deletions and insertions produce tell - tale patterns in the mapping of paired - end reads .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] ( a ) shows a deletion of bases @xmath21 to @xmath9 in the reference genome .",
    "the deleted region is labeled @xmath22 and is spanned by regions @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the absence of structural change , the mapped insert length is random with distribution @xmath1 , which is chosen in the fragmentation step .",
    "fragments that span the deletion point , i.e. those that start in @xmath23 and end in @xmath24 in the target , produce read pairs that map further apart in the reference than expected under @xmath1 . now consider figure [ fig : schematic ] ( b ) , where an insertion @xmath22 , spanned by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , starts at position @xmath9 in the reference genome .",
    "reads that overlap with @xmath22 would fail to map , if @xmath22 were a foreign sequence with no homolog in the target genome , or it would map far from its mate , if @xmath22 were a `` domestic '' insertion from a distant location of the reference .",
    "read pairs where one read maps successfully and the other fails to map , maps in the same orientation , or maps too far from the first are called _ hanging pairs_. some alignment algorithms allow only the prefix or the suffix of a read to be mapped , often called `` soft - clipping . '' in this case , we also include read pairs where one read is soft - clipped in our definition of hanging pairs .",
    "deletions can also produce hanging pairs , if one read of a given pair straddles the boundary between @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the target genome .",
    "similarly , fragments that contain insertions produce read pairs that map closer to each other than expected under @xmath1 . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe models and statistics that exploit these patterns to detect structural variants .",
    "mapping of paired - end reads in region of deletion ( a ) and insertion ( b ) . in ( a )",
    ", the deleted region , labeled @xmath22 , spans bases @xmath21 to @xmath9 in the reference genome , and is flanked by regions a and c. read pairs that span the deletion point , i.e. with the plus read in @xmath23 and minus read in @xmath24 in the target , map further apart in the reference than expected . in ( b ) , the inserted segment b is flanked by regions a and c in the target genome , with a and c joined together in the reference genome .",
    "fragments containing the a - b boundary produce hanging minus strand reads , while those that contain the b - c boundary produce hanging plus strand reads . deletions also produce hanging reads , if the end of a fragment overlaps with the boundary between @xmath23 and @xmath24 in target . similarly , for insertions , fragments that contain the entire inserted segment produce read pairs that map closer together than expected .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +      chromatin immuno - precipitation ( chip ) is a technique for isolating from a dna sample only those dna fragments bound to a protein of interest .",
    "sequencing reads from the ends of the dna fragments derived from chip , called chip - seq , then mapping these reads to a reference template allows us to detect the binding locations of the protein in the genome of the sample .",
    "one expects to see an increase in the density of mapped reads near the binding site . under the assumption that the binding site is short compared to @xmath0 , it is natural to assume that the `` shape '' of the peak centered on the site is roughly triangular .",
    "following schwartzmann _",
    "( 2012 ) , we consider @xmath25 where now it is convenient to assume that the jumps in @xmath26 are located at the central nucleotides of the reads and @xmath27 is a symmetric kernel . the function @xmath28 is a plausible `` matched filter . ''",
    "an alternative kernel is a gaussian probability density function with standard deviation @xmath29 . the scale parameter @xmath29 indicating the width of the signal may be known or unknown .",
    "it is easy to see that the log likelihood ratio for testing the intensity function @xmath5 against the alternative of a peak at @xmath30 of the form @xmath31 equals @xmath32\\rho(s ) ds.\\ ] ] since the location @xmath30 is unknown , one might consider one of several statistics maximized over candidate values of @xmath30 .",

    "below we shall see other examples involving convolution of a smooth function with a poisson process .",
    "it has often been found that the coverage process @xmath16 is overdispersed .",
    "this can be handled by using a negative binomial process , or equivalently a gamma mixture of poisson processes . to see how this effects ( [ deletion ] ) , consider a poisson distribution with mean @xmath36 , where @xmath36 has the probability density function @xmath37^{-1 } \\alpha^q \\xi^{q-1 } \\exp(-\\alpha \\xi)$ ] . to maintain a baseline intensity of @xmath5 for the observed process",

    "consider first a simplified model for the detection of insertions and deletions using the mapped insert lengths in paired - end sequencing .",
    "we consider for now only those pairs where both reads are unambiguously mapped in opposite orientation . for read pair @xmath42 ,",
    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the mapped positions of the plus and minus strand reads , respectively .",
    "for a reference template of length @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the mapped insert length , which we denote by @xmath47 for read pair @xmath42 , is defined by @xmath48 .",
    "if there are no structural variants , @xmath47 has distribution @xmath49 with mean @xmath2 and standard deviation @xmath3 . as described in section [ sec : sv ] , deletions cause an increase in mapped insert length , and small insertions cause a decrease .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath29 , where the sign of @xmath29 is positive for deletions and negative for insertions , and @xmath50 is the number of bases in the deleted or inserted segment .",
    "also , let @xmath51 be the proportion of genomes in the sample carrying the variant . both @xmath29 and @xmath51 are usually unknown , although it will be convenient to study statistics defined by particular values of these parameters .",
    "then , for read pairs straddling the deletion point or inserted segment in the target , their mapped insert lengths have the mixture distribution @xmath52    to detect insertions and deletions , we consider as a toy model the two - dimensional poisson random field @xmath53 for simplicity , we assume for @xmath26 the null intensity function @xmath54 , where @xmath5 is the rate with which plus strand reads map to genome position @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , we can think of this process as a marked ( or compound ) poisson process with rate @xmath5 and marks that follow @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "an insertion or deletion starting at @xmath21 causes those read pairs with plus strand read mapping to a window before @xmath21 to have insert length following @xmath56 .",

    "varying @xmath21 and possibly also @xmath51 and @xmath29 , can be used to detect insertions and/or deletions .",
    "compared to models that we will introduce in section [ sec : bettermodel ] , the scan statistic suggested here has a simple , general structure due to the assumption that the rate function for the two dimensional process is a product of one dimensional rate functions .",
    "this leads to relatively simple theoretical properties that may be of general interest for problems involving mixtures in compound poisson processes . in regard to dna structural variants",
    ", the formulation ignores some important features of dna sequencing data by emphasizing information in the insert length and ignoring information from the coverage process and the hanging pairs , as described in section [ sec : sv ] .",
    "in particular the alternative rate function ( [ lambda1simple ] ) makes the simplifying assumption that all read pairs with plus strand read mapping within @xmath61 are equally informative about the existence of a deletion / insertion at @xmath21 . in section",
    "[ sec : bettermodel ] , we describe a more realistic model for the structural variant detection problem .      before introducing more explicit models , we shall describe an abstract framework for scans of poisson - type data .",
    "we assume that the observed data are a counting process @xmath62 , that has a null intensity function @xmath63 on the domain @xmath64 .",
    "for example , in the single - read sequencing set - up of sections [ sec : cnv ] and [ sec : chipseq ] , @xmath65 is the coverage process , with @xmath66 being a one - dimensional index for genome location . in the mixture model proposed in section [ sec : simple ] , @xmath67 , @xmath68\\times \\re$ ] , and @xmath65 counts the number of read pairs with plus strand read mapping to a given location and mapped insert length within a given range .",
    "the signal of interest in all cases is a local change in intensity , which is represented with an alternative intensity function @xmath69 that relies on one or more parameter(s ) , collectively denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "for example , in section [ sec : simple ] @xmath30 can be the single parameter for genome location , @xmath21 , but can also be the vector @xmath70 which quantifies also the proportion and length of the signal . for reasons that will become apparent in section [ sec :",
    "tailapprox ] , we introduce the representation @xmath71 where we call @xmath72 the kernel function .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 plays a technical role in false positive rate calculations .",
    "the alternative of interest for the models in sections [ sec : simple ] and [ sec : bettermodel ] is @xmath73 .",
    "expressed in this way , ( [ loglik1 ] ) can be written somewhat more abstractly in the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 - 1\\ } \\lambda_0(dz)\\;.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the scan statistics ( [ deletion],[chipseq ] ) for detecting copy number variants and peaks in chip - seq data can be written in this form .",
    "the representation ( [ loglik ] ) allows for much simpler notation in moment calculation and tail approximations in sections [ sec : moments ] and [ sec : tailapprox ] .    to complete the specification of the alternative intensity ( [ lambda1simple ] )",
    ", we assume that @xmath55 is given by the normal density with respect to @xmath76 , so @xmath77 .",
    "the normal distribution has been a good fit to the center of the mapped insert length distributions in the data that we have examined ; see detailed example in section [ sec : data ] . for the mixture model",

    "in general we will consider , as raw material for scan statistics , the random fields ( [ loglik ] ) , indexed by the unknown parameters @xmath30 . note that the random field is in general not differentiable in the parameter @xmath21 for location , but is typically differentiable in the other parameters that determine the alternative distribution .",
    "the mixture model suggested above neglects a number of features of the problem of detecting structural variants by paired end reads . here",
    "we propose alternative models , which differ slightly between insertions and deletions .",
    "let @xmath83 be the number of read pairs where at least one read within the pair is successfully mapped to the template .",

    "the marginal power of the sum @xmath280 is greater than that for @xmath147 alone , but then the marginal power of the hanging read statistic in these cases is even greater .    in the empirical data that we have examined , larger mean insert lengths also have substantially larger standard deviations .",
    "also , such libraries tend to exhibit skewness and sometimes even multimodality .",
    "a consequence of the contemporary move to increase read and insert length is that relatively speaking the hanging read statistics gain power , but the bracketing pairs statistics can lose substantial power .",
    "our analyses in section [ sec : sv2 ] assume constant read coverage @xmath96 .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : bettermodel ] , mean read coverage has been empirically observed to fluctuate along the genome and correlates with known features such as gc content . since the null distribution of the scores depend on @xmath96 , if we allow @xmath96 to vary the thresholds for the scores would change with genome position .",
    "even with the analytic approximations for the p - values , back - solving them to obtain appropriate thresholds for a given significance level requires a substantially increased amount oft computation .",
    "one could also conduct the scan using the corresponding likelihood ratios @xmath281 , the thresholds for which are much less variable as a function of @xmath96",
    ". however , the parameter @xmath15 in the likelihood ratio statistic would vary with @xmath96 and thus the computational issue can not be avoided .",
    "a viable option in practice is to first segment the genome into blocks of approximately homogeneous read coverage , then scan each block separately with a threshold computed using the block - specific @xmath96 .",
    "the global p - value would then be simply the sum of the block - wise p - values . in implementing this approach",
    ", one may want to ignore genomic regions of low coverage .",
    "one of the lessons of the simple mixture model is that a substantial amount of power is inevitably lost in regions of low coverage and can not be recovered by a simple adjustment of the significance threshold .",
    "an open question is how different statistics should be combined to improve detection accuracy .",
    "we found in our power analysis that summing the scores , as in the log - likelihood , is rarely better than applying each score individually .",
    "the reason is that for most alternative settings there is one score that dominates the others , and incorporating the others by simple addition contributes mainly noise .",
    "thus , it may be better to apply each score individually and then combine detections using a bonferroni correction",
    ". it may also be better to combine the scores in a weighted sum , as in senbaobaglu , li and zhang ( 2011 ) .    while we have been focusing mainly on control of the family - wise error rate , in genomic studies the false discovery rate ( fdr )",
    "is often an appealing mode of multiple testing control .",
    "the boundary crossing probabilities can be easily converted into the expected number of false discoveries under the null , and used for fdr control as described in siegmund , yakir , and zhang ( 2011 ) .",
