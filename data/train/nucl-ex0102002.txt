    "antiprotonic helium consisting of an alpha particle , an antiproton , and an electron ( he@xmath4 @xmath5he@xmath6 ) , was found to have lifetimes in the microsecond range , thus enabling its examination with spectroscopy techniques .",

    "[ 46fig : leveldiag ] ) . a major experiment at the ad will be the measurement of level splittings caused by the magnetic interaction of its constituents .",
    "due to the large angular momentum of the antiproton , the dominant splitting comes from the interaction of the antiproton angular momentum and the electron spin .",
    "since it is caused by the interaction of different particles , it is called a hyperfine structure ( hfs ) .",
    "its magnitude is about 10@xmath815 ghz .",
    "the antiproton spin leads to a further , by two orders of magnitude smaller splitting ( called super hyperfine structure , shfs ) .",
    "we describe an already installed two - laser microwave triple resonance experiment to determine this unique level splitting accurately .",
    "a measurement of the hf splitting will constitute a test of existing three - body calculations and , through comparison with these calculations , has the potential to become a cpt test by extracting a value of the antiproton magnetic moment with possibly higher accuracy than it is currently known .",
    "the formation and spectroscopy of antihydrogen , the simplest form of neutral antimatter consisting of an antiproton and a positron , is one of the central topics at the ad .",
    "complementary to the 1s-2s laser spectroscopy pursued by the two other experiments at the ad , athena @xcite and atrap @xcite , the asacusa collaboration is developing a measurement of the antihydrogen ground - state hyperfine structure .",
    "this quantity is of great interest for cpt studies in the hadronic sector , since this value for hydrogen is one of the most accurately measured physical quantities , but the theoretical precision is limited by the much less accurately known electric and magnetic form factors of the proton . by measuring the hfs of antihydrogen",

    "[ 46fig : leveldiag ] is split due to the presence of three angular momenta : the orbital angular momentum @xmath9 ( mainly carried by the @xmath3 ) , and the spins of the electron @xmath10 and the antiproton @xmath11 .",
    "these momenta couple according to the following scheme : @xmath12 due to the large orbital angular momentum of the @xmath3  ( @xmath13 ) occupying metastable states , the dominant splitting is caused by the interaction of the spin - averaged @xmath3  magnetic moment and the electron spin , giving rise to a doublet with @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the associated energy splitting @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "[ 46fig : hfs - leveldiag ] ) .",
    "this splitting is called the _ hyperfine ( hf ) structure_. the @xmath3  spin causes an additional , smaller splitting for each of the hf states , which is called here the _ super hyperfine ( shf ) structure_.    he@xmath6 . the @xmath3",
    "is captured by replacing one of the 1s electrons , which corresponds for the @xmath3  to a state with principal quantum number @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the reduced mass of the atomcule , and @xmath19 the electron mass .",
    "about 3% of antiprotons are captured in metastable states ( black lines ) at high angular momenta @xmath20 , for which deexcitation by auger transitions is much slower than radiative transitions .",
    "the lifetimes of these states is in the order of @xmath21s .",
    "the antiprotons follow predominantly cascades with constant vibration quantum number @xmath22 ( black arrows ) until they reach an auger - dominated short - lived state .",
    "the atomcule then ionizes within @xmath23 ns and the @xmath3he@xmath24  is immediately destroyed in the surrounding helium medium .",
    "the overall average lifetime of atomcules is about @xmath25 @xmath21s . ]",
    "the hf and shf structure has been calculated by bakalov and korobov @xcite using the best three - body wavefunctions of korobov @xcite , and recently by yamanaka et al .",
    "@xcite using wavefunctions calculated by kino et al . by the coupled rearrangement - channel method @xcite .",
    "they present the hf and shf energies in terms of the angular momentum operators as @xmath26 the first term gives the dominant hf splitting .",

    "according to the calculation , the contact and the tensor terms almost cancel and the shf splitting is nearly equal to the one - body spin - orbit splitting as given by the second term .",

    "but from theoretical calculations @xcite it follows that the splitting arising from the shf structure is too small ( @xmath40 mhz ) to be resolved in our experimental conditions ( the @xmath3  of momentum 100 mev / c ( 5.3 mev kinetic energy ) are stopped in rather dense helium gas of temperature @xmath41 k and pressure @xmath42 mbar ) where the doppler broadening amounts to @xmath43 mhz .",

    "[ 46fig : hfs - leveldiag ] ) , the population of these levels can be equalized , and the second laser pulse at @xmath59 will detect a larger population and thus the peak at @xmath59 will be larger .",
    "if the ratio @xmath60 of the peak areas at @xmath59 and @xmath58 is plotted against the microwave frequency , two resonances should be observed for the two allowed transitions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as shown in fig .",

    "the hyperfine structure of the ground state of the hydrogen atom is also among the best known quantities in physics , which has had a large impact on quantum physics at every stage of its development , as described in a review by ramsey @xcite .",
    "the first measurements were done 60 years @xcite ago with stern - gerlach type inhomogeneous magnets where the hydrogen atoms were deflected by the force of the magnetic field gradients onto the magnetic moment of the electron .    with the advent of the magnetic resonance method the hyperfine splitting of the hydrogen ground state",
    "was successfully determined from microwave resonance transitions by nafe and nelson @xcite and later by prodell and kusch @xcite .",
    "the precision attained by the first resonance experiment was already impressively high : @xmath2@xmath80 mhz , which supersedes the uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of the present day , as shown below .",
    "in the early stages , room temperature hydrogen atoms were transported through inhomogeneous magnetic field and the transit time in the resonance cavity set an intrinsic limit on the resonance width . as hydrogen atoms became confined ,",
    "the precision increased accordingly , and even a maser oscillation was finally observed @xcite .",
    "the best value to the present @xcite is    @xmath81    in the case of antihydrogen we can trace a similar historical development , starting from a stern - gerlach type experiment and proceeding to microwave resonance experiments . at each stage a meaningful value of the antihydrogen hyperfine structure constant can be obtained .",
    "the possible results and the achievable precision are discussed in the next section .",
    "section [ 46sec : hbarexp ] describes a possible experimental scenario to measure @xmath2 .      the hyperfine coupling frequency in the hydrogen ground state is given to the leading term by the fermi contact interaction , yielding    @xmath82    which is a direct product of the electron magnetic moment and the anomalous proton magnetic moment ( here @xmath83 ) .",
    "using the known proton magnetic moment , this formula yields @xmath84 mhz , which is significantly different from the experimental value and subsequently led to the discovery of the anomalous electron @xmath85-factor .",
    "even after higher - order qed corrections @xcite still a significant difference between theory and experiment remained , as    @xmath86    this discrepancy was largely accounted for by the non - relativistic magnetic size correction ( zemach correction ) @xcite :    @xmath87      } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath88 is the fermi contact term defined in ( [ 46eq : fermi ] ) , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the electric and magnetic form factor of the proton , and @xmath91 its anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the zemach corrections therefore contain both the magnetic and charge distribution of the proton .",
    "a detailed treatment of the zemach corrections can be found in @xcite . assuming the validity of the dipole approximation",
    ", the two form factors can be correlated @xmath92    where the @xmath93 is related to the proton charge radius by @xmath94 . whether the dipole approximation is indeed a good approximation , however , is not really clear .",
    "integration by separation of low and high - momentum regions with various separation values , and the use of different values for @xmath95 gives a value for the zemach corrections of @xmath96 ppm @xcite . with this correction , and some more recently calculated ones ,",
    "the theoretical value deviates from the experimental one by @xcite    @xmath97    a further structure effect , the proton polarizability , is only estimated to be @xmath98 ppm @xcite , of the same order than the value above .",
    "the `` agreement '' between theory and experiment is therefore only valid on a level of @xmath99 ppm .",

    "[ 46fig : breit - rabi]b ) it is clear that the states @xmath113 and @xmath106 prefer lower magnetic fields since this minimizes their energy ( `` low - field seekers '' ) , while the opposite is true for the other two states .",

    "<S> this paper describes measurements of the hyperfine structure of two antiprotonic atoms that are planned at the antiproton decelerator ( ad ) at cern . the first part deals with antiprotonic helium , a three - body system of @xmath0-particle , antiproton and electron that was previously studied at lear . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement will test existing three - body calculations and may  through comparison with these theories  determine the magnetic moment @xmath1  of the antiproton more precisely than currently available , thus providing a test of cpt invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the second system , antihydrogen , consisting of an antiproton and a positron , is planned to be produced at thermal energies at the ad . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of the ground - state hyperfine splitting @xmath2 , which for hydrogen is one of the most accurately measured physical quantities , will directly yield a precise value for @xmath1 , and also compare the internal structure of proton and antiproton through the contribution of the magnetic size of the @xmath3  to @xmath2 .    </S>",
