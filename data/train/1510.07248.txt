    "celestial mechanics has provided a huge playground for mathematicians and physicists for a long time .",
    "one of interesting object is the motion of the moon . before hill ,",
    "the accuracy of the lunar theory was not so good .",
    "hill introduced a problem for the lunar theory which reflects successfully the perturbation effect of the sun .",
    "this problem is called hill s lunar problem . hill s",
    "lunar problem can be derived from the ( circular planar ) restricted three body problem .",
    "the restricted three body problem is obtained from the three body problem by assuming one particle , say @xmath2(moon ) , is massless and two primaries , say @xmath7(sun , earth ) , take the keplerian circular motion on the plane.(satellite ) and two primaries @xmath8(earth , moon ) .",
    "here we use the moon as a massless particle in the sun - earth system in order to emphasize the relation with hill s lunar problem . ] with normalizations of physical constants , one can derive the hamiltonian @xmath9 for the motion of @xmath2 where @xmath10 is the mass ratio between the mass of the earth and the total mass . in order to obtain a time - independent hamiltonian we used the rotating reference frame .",
    "the term @xmath11 is due to this rotating coordinate .",
    "if one takes the limit @xmath12 , then we get the hamiltonian @xmath13 of the rotating kepler problem .",
    "as one can see , this is the kepler problem on the rotating reference frame .",
    "the rotating kepler problem is completely integrable like kepler problem .",
    "in fact , @xmath14 is another integral .",
    "this problem provides a good starting point to approach the restrict three body problem as a limit . because we can figure out all periodic orbit of the rotating kepler problem from the kepler problem ,",
    "if one has a technique to obtain information by comparing or perturbing the hamiltonians , then the rotating kepler problem can be a good candidate as a reference problem to reach the restricted three body problem and hill s lunar problem . at this point of view , in this paper , we will also use this problem to study hill s lunar problem .",
    "lunar problem , in modern language , can be obtained by not only taking @xmath12 but also thinking of the blow - up coordinate of order @xmath15 near the earth , see @xcite for the derivation .",
    "we recall the hamiltonian @xmath16 of hill s lunar problem .",
    "lunar problem was introduced by hill in order to study the stability of the orbit of the moon in @xcite .",
    "hill assumed that the sun is infinitely far away from the earth and has infinite mass .",
    "this approach brought us a simple hamiltonian with great improvement in accuracy .",
    "as one can see , the difference on hamiltonians of the rotating kepler problem and hill s lunar problem is only the degree 2 term @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the dynamics , this difference gives a dramatic change .",
    "for example , hill s lunar problem is not completely integrable while the rotating kepler problem is completely integrable .",
    "non - integrability of hill s lunar problem has been proved by many authors with many versions .",
    "the analytic non - integrability of hill s lunar problem was proved by meletlidou , ichtiaroglou and winterberg in @xcite .",
    "morales - ruiz , sim@xmath18 and simon gave an algebraic proof of meromorphic non - integrability in @xcite .",
    "recently , llibre and roberto in @xcite discussed the @xmath19 integrability based on the existence of two periodic orbits on every positive energy level .",
    "one can see the chaotic feature of hill s lunar problem in the numerical research of sim@xmath18 and stuchi in @xcite .",
    "the fundamental motivation of this paper comes from poincar@xmath20 .",
    "poincar@xmath20 emphasized the importance of periodic orbits in the study of dynamics .",
    "he said that the periodic orbits are the skeleton of dynamics of a given problem. indeed , periodic orbits in a hamiltonian dynamics arise as generators of floer theory .",
    "one can ask how much dynamics will be changed by the change of the hamiltonian . of course , it is a complicated problem in general . however ,",
    "if we restrict our problem on the periodic orbit , there are many available tools in symplectic theory .",
    "floer homology and symplectic homology is invariant under the change of hamiltonians , respectively .",
    "moreover , the action spectrum of the boundary of a liouville domain is invariant under liouville isomorphisms .",
    "this stability of the action spectrum was proved in @xcite and they used this to define local floer homology . at first glance",
    ", it seems floer homology and symplectic homology do not give any information under the change of hamiltonians .",
    "however , if we consider the action filtration on the homology , then the homology with action filtration can reflect the change of hamiltonians because , in general , the change of hamiltonians does not give a liouville isomorphism .",
    "in addition ,    the study of the symplectic topology has been actively done .",
    "this study on the symplectic topology has brought sometimes the progress of the celestial mechanics . as a remarkable example , in @xcite , they proved the existence of global surfaces of section in the restricted three body problem for some pair of mass ratio and energy @xmath21 .",
    "they used the finite energy plane theory in @xcite based on the pseudo - holomorphic curve theory .",
    "this theory is still developing actively .",
    "for example , in the upcoming book @xcite , they collect many valuable applications of holomorphic curve theory to celestial mechanics .",
    "many valuable symplectic theories like contact homology , symplectic field theory and finite energy foliation has been originated from this theory . from gromov",
    "s nonsqueezing theorem , the relation between symplectic embedding and the periodic orbit has been emphasized , see the introduction of @xcite . for a systematic approach of the symplectic embeddings ,",
    "one can use the notion of symplectic capacity .",
    "symplectic capacities are symplectic invariants inspired by the gromov s work in @xcite .",
    "ekeland and hofer introduced the definition of symplectic capacity for the subsets of @xmath22 in @xcite .",

    "in fact , this completes the above theorem .    in this paper , we will discuss another kind of generalization by considering the metric on @xmath75 . for this generalization",
    ", we recall the definition of a finsler metric on a smooth manifold .",
    "a finsler manifold is a differentiable manifold @xmath59 equipped with a finsler function @xmath246 on the tangent bundle @xmath132 .",
    "namely , @xmath246 satisfies the following conditions .",
    "+ @xmath247 @xmath246 is smooth on @xmath248 . here",

    "metric @xmath246 is not an inner product on each tangent space but defines a norm on each tangent space .",
    "let us define the corresponding geometric object .",
    "let @xmath59 be a differentiable manifold .",
    "a hypersurface @xmath173 , codimension 1 submanifold , of the tangent bundle @xmath132 is called fiberwise convex if @xmath257 bounds a strictly convex bounded domain of @xmath258 which contains the origin for each @xmath44 .",
    "one can immediately see that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of all finsler metrics and the set of all fiberwise convex hypersurfaces for any fixed manifold @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath259    we can rewrite the above two definitions for the cotangent bundle @xmath260 by the exactly same way .",

    "for the embedding @xmath263 of an energy hypersurface under the above maps , if its closure @xmath264 in @xmath86 is a fiberwise convex hypersurface of @xmath86 , then the hamiltonian flow on @xmath265 can be interpreted as a geodesic flow of the corresponding finsler metric on @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", we will say that the hamiltonian dynamics defined by @xmath150 is fiberwise convex for energy @xmath78 .",
    "this generalization has been applied particularly to celestial mechanics problems related to kepler problem . in @xcite , they prove fiberwise convexity of the rotating kepler problem .",
    "fiberwise convextity of hill s lunar problem was also proved in @xcite .",
    "one goal in this generalization is determining fiberwise convexity of the restricted three body problem .",
    "we still do not know fiberwise convexity of the restricted three body problem .",
    "now , we want to introduce precisely the main ingredients of this paper as examples of this generalization .",
    "the bounded component of the regularized rotating kepler problem is fiberwise convex for all energy below the critical level .",
    "the bounded component of the regularized hill s lunar problem is fiberwise convex for all energy below the critical level .",
    "we introduce the hamiltonians @xmath266 and @xmath267 of the rotating kepler problem and hill s lunar problem , respectively .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath268 and @xmath269 have one critical value @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",

    "we will call @xmath274(@xmath275 ) the energy hypersurface of the regularized rotating kepler problem(hill s lunar problem ) at energy @xmath78 for each @xmath272 @xmath276.the above theorems mean that @xmath274 and @xmath77 are fiberwise convex hypersurfaces for each @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "therefore , we can regard each of the rotating kepler problem and hill s lunar problem as a geodesic problem on @xmath75 equipped with a finsler metric .",
    "one immediate consequence of fiberwise convexity of a hamiltonian problem is admitting a contact structure of the hamiltonian problem .",
    "therefore , we can apply theorem in contact topology . by eliashberg work in @xcite",
    ", there is a unique tight contact sturcture up to isotopy . from the criterion due to eliashberg and gromov @xcite , @xcite , any symplectically fillable contact 3-manifold is tight .",
    "because regularized energy hypersurfaces @xmath76 and @xmath77 are symplectically fillable and diffeomorphic to @xmath277 , we have the following corollary .",
    "the bounded component of the regularized rotating kepler problem and the regularized hill s lunar problem has a contact structure for the energy level below each critical value .",
    "moreover , these contact structures are the unique tight contact structure on @xmath277 up to contact isotopy .",

    "if one can prove that a hamiltonian @xmath150 defines a fiberwise star - shaped hypersurface @xmath173 in @xmath86 along this procedure , then we can think of the hamiltonian flow as a reeb flow of the contact manifold @xmath278 up to reparametrization .",
    "moreover , the inside @xmath2 of @xmath173 in @xmath86 defines a liouville domain .",
    "because the tools in this paper can be applied to any liouville domain defined by a fiberwise star - shaped hypersurface in a cotangent bundle , it is worthwhile to mention the contact structure of the restricted three body problem in @xcite .    for a energy @xmath279 below the first critical value , two bounded components @xmath280 and @xmath281 of the regularized restricted three body problem in @xmath86 admit compatible contact forms , respectively",
    ". moreover , there exists @xmath282 such that for @xmath283 the bounded component @xmath284 admits a compatible contact form @xmath285 .    in @xcite , they opened the possibility of using contact topology in order to understand the dynamics of the restricted three body problem .    for @xmath286 ,",

    "in symplectic topology , it is important to know the conley - zehnder indices of periodic orbits . these indices play important roles in finite energy foliations , floer homology and so on . in a general hamiltonian problem , these indices are hard to compute .",
    "moreover , we do not know where and how many periodic orbits are in many hamiltonian problem .",
    "however , in the rotating kepler problem , the conley - zehnder indices of all periodic orbits for energies below the critical value were completely determined in @xcite .",
    "we will introduce the result briefly and we will compute the action value of each orbits . this will lead us to understand the chain complex structure in the symplectic homology of the liouville domains determined by the rotating kepler problem .      in this section , we will recall the result in @xcite .",
    "they use the conley - zehnder index defined in @xcite . because the rotating kepler problem is time - independent",
    ", there is the always present degeneracy if we use the definition in section 4.1 . in @xcite",
    ", they use the restirction to the contact plane of hypersurface and so according to this definition , the retrograde and direct orbits are generically nondegenerate . in @xcite",
    ", they compute directly the indices of the retrograde and direct orbits using the suitably chosen trivialization of the contact structure .",
    "for the noncircular orbits @xmath291 , the conley - zehnder indices are computed by using the fiberwise convexity of the regularized rotating kepler problem . because one can interpret the periodic orbits as critical points of the energy functional associated to a finsler metric",
    ", the conley - zehnder index agrees with the morse index of the energy functional .",
    "then one can use the local invariance of morse homology to determine the morse index of @xmath292 at the bifurcatiion point .",
    "for example , if one has a degenerate orbit of @xmath293-family with the conley - zehnder index @xmath294 , then this will become the nondegenerate obits of conley - zehnder index @xmath294 and @xmath295 after suitable perturbation in section 4.1 .",
    "we introduce the notations .",
    "we start with the hamiltonian of the kepler problem @xmath216 and we know this has angular momentum integral @xmath296 because @xmath297 is invariant under rotations around @xmath298 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath297 is an integral as well because it is time - independent .",
    "we will denote @xmath297 by @xmath129 for the notational convenience . as we have seen in moser regularization ,",
    "every orbit of the hamiltonian equation for @xmath297 is periodic orbit , including the collision orbit after regularization , for negative energy .",
    "in fact , we know the orbits are either ellipses of eccentricity @xmath299 or collision orbits by kepler s laws of planetary motion .",
    "moreover , we have the equality @xmath300 for the period @xmath301 of the ellipse .",
    "the rotating kepler problem is the kepler problem in a rotating coordinate system .",
    "the hamiltonian of the rotating kepler problem is given by @xmath302 in our convention .",
    "this has the unique critical value @xmath303 .",
    "we are interested in the energy hypersurfaces below this critical value .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath304 are integrals of the rotating kepler problem and invariant under the hamiltonian flow . even though every orbit is periodic in the kepler problem ,",
    "not every orbit is periodic in the rotating kepler problem .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian flow of the rotating kepler problem is given by the composition @xmath305 of two hamiltonian flows where @xmath306 is the rotation @xmath307 generated by the hamiltonian @xmath131 and @xmath308 is the hamiltonian flow generated by the hamiltonian @xmath129 .",
    "therefore a periodic orbit in the kepler problem should satisfy a resonance condition in general in order to be a periodic orbit in the rotating kepler problem .",
    "first , the circular orbits in the kepler problem give the circular orbits in the rotating kepler problem and always give the periodic orbits . by the direction of the rotation of circular orbits in the kepler problem",
    ", we have two types of the circular orbits in the rotating kepler problem .",
    "if we consider the opposite direction of the coordinate rotation , then we have the retrograde orbit and denote by @xmath309 .",

    "there exist two zeros less than @xmath314 for each @xmath315 .",
    "the smaller zero corresponds to the retrograde orbit and the other zero corresponds to the direct orbit .",
    "second , an ellipse orbit with positive eccentricity in the kepler problem gives a periodic orbit in the rotating kepler problem if and only if the period is a rational multiple of @xmath316 .",
    "if @xmath317 for some @xmath318 and the orbit is a @xmath294-fold cover of ellipses in the inertial coordinate , then we we call this periodic orbit a @xmath294-fold covered ellipse in an @xmath319-fold covered coordinate system and denote it by @xmath320 . in the circular orbit case ,",

    ", we have @xmath325 and the energy level @xmath326 of this underlying ellipse of @xmath321 is @xmath327 for each @xmath328 . in fact , we only consider the energy @xmath329 and so we will assume @xmath330 . from the eccentricity equation , @xmath320 can exist only when the inequality @xmath331 holds .",
    "we solve this inequality for @xmath279 .",
    "then we have the energy range @xmath332 for @xmath333 where @xmath334 at @xmath335 , the eccentricity is @xmath298 and @xmath336 .",

    "for example , if we consider @xmath1059(in fact , arbitrarily close @xmath279 to @xmath1060 ) , then we have spectral gap @xmath1061 for the contact manifold @xmath1062 .",
    "this means @xmath1063 because the upper bound of these estimates is global , we can say @xmath1064 for every @xmath1053 .",
    "as we discussed in example 4.1.7 and remark 4.1 , if the condition @xmath769 holds for some @xmath754 , then we can use the @xmath59-th iteration of the retrograde and direct orbits as generators of symplectic homology for @xmath107 .",
    "for such @xmath279 , we denote these generators by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , for each @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , one can easily compute that @xmath1065 using @xmath1066 for all @xmath754 . therefore ,",
    "if we combine these fact with corollary 5.6 and proposition 5.7 , then we have the following theorem    suppose that @xmath115 for @xmath1067 .",
    "then we have estimates of symplectic capacity @xmath117 for all @xmath107 .",
    "this provides spectral gaps for the contact manifold @xmath1068 . if @xmath115 , then we have @xmath1069 ; 2n-1 ) \\ne \\phi\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and @xmath1070 ; 2n+1 ) \\ne \\phi\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for @xmath107 .",
    "we denote by @xmath1071 ; k)$ ] the action value between @xmath598 and @xmath271 with conley - zehnder index @xmath294 .",
    "this implies only the existence of orbits with an action range and an index .",
    "thus we do not know whether they are geometrically different or a orbit is multiple cover of another orbit and so on .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to get such geometric informations from homological informations .",
    "conjecturally , the author guesses that the retrograde orbit of hill s lunar problem has period @xmath1072 with index 1 and the direct orbit of hill s lunar problem has period @xmath1073 with index 3 . however , there is no evidence for this guess .",
    "we recall the definition of the systole and the systolic volume of a contact manifold @xmath1057 from @xcite .",
    "the systole of a contact manifold @xmath1057 is the smallest period of its periodic reeb orbits .",
    "we denote the systole of @xmath1057 by @xmath1056 .",
    "we define the systolic volume of @xmath1057 by @xmath1074 where @xmath1057 is a @xmath1075-dimensional contact manifold and @xmath1076 is the contact volume @xmath1077 .    the goal of this appendix is to find the systolic volume @xmath1078 for the energy hypersurface of the regularized rotating kepler problem at energy @xmath78 .",
    "we already know that the systole periodic orbit is the retrograde orbit and its action .",
    "it is enough to obtain the contact volume of @xmath111 .",
    "we use the result in @xcite .",
    "they compute the finsler function @xmath1080 corresponding to @xmath111 in the stereographic projection chart of @xmath86 .",
    "namely , we have @xmath1081 for each @xmath315 .",
    "we also have that @xmath1082 by definition and stokes theorem .",
    "furthermore , we can deduce @xmath1083 where the last term is the usual riemann integral .",
    "we note that @xmath1084 we use the polar coordinates @xmath1085 .",
    "then we can express the condition @xmath1086 in terms of @xmath1087 where @xmath1088 .",
    "for fixed @xmath1089 , we have the polar equation @xmath1090 for the trajectory of @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , @xmath1091 if we use the polar coordinates @xmath1092 , then we get the integral @xmath1093 for the volume . in sum",
