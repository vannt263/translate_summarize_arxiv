    "mathematical modeling of the spread of epidemics poses intriguing challenges and promises useful insights and possibly predictive capabilities .",
    "recent work by some of the present coauthors @xcite has led to the understanding of observed features , particularly spatiotemporal patterns , in the hantavirus infection @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to initiate a formalism for the understanding of the west nile virus epidemic , which bears some similarities , but possesses some distinguishing characteristics , relative to the hantavirus .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in the rest of the section we describe some essential characteristics of the west nile virus epidemic and comment on how they may be folded into a model of differential equations similar to the abramson - kenkre ( ak ) model of the hantavirus @xcite . in section [ gen_model ] ,",
    "we modify the hantavirus model equations to incorporate cross - infection of two taxa , a characteristic of the west nile virus epidemic .",
    "we comment on general features expected on the grounds of simple intuition based on nonlinear dynamics . in section [ realistic_model ] , we augment the generalized cross - infection model to include three realistic features of the west nile virus epidemic and present scenarios for time evolution of the populations of mosquitoes and birds , the two taxa which appear central to the west nile virus problem .",
    "the present paucity of field data prevents us from attempting to explain specific observations .",
    "however , interesting predictions of the ` what - if ' type are possible as will be seen below . concluding remarks form section [ conclusion ] .",
    "west nile virus is a mosquito - borne virus that infects primarily birds , but also a wide range of other species , including horses , dogs and cats , and occasionally humans .",
    "the first outbreak of west nile virus encephalitis on the north american continent occurred in new york in 1999 .",
    "successive outbreaks in humans have occurred annually in the usa since then .",
    "west nile virus is fatal in many species of birds , and is sometimes fatal in humans .",
    "it is unusual among mosquito - borne diseases in that `` vertical transmission '' , where the virus is passed from the mother to her eggs , may occur in the wild .",
    "this has potentially serious consequences , because once an area is infected it may remain so indefinitely , because the virus may survive the winter in infected mosquito larvae and reemerge to infect human and animal populations in the spring @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that the virus travels along watershed areas through avian and mosquito host populations @xcite .",
    "extensive field studies have led to attention being focused on birds as well as mosquitoes in the dynamics of the west nile virus epidemic . during their migration ,",
    "infected birds arrive at a location and transmit the virus to female mosquitoes that feed upon them .",
    "the mosquitoes in turn transmit the virus to other birds , not originally infected , and to other animals including horses and humans .",
    "collection of field data consists , therefore , of testing mosquitoes and birds .",
    "mosquitoes are trapped with co@xmath0-releasing boxes with organic - rich water at their base .",
    "in addition , surveillance systems for reporting dead birds and testing them for infection , as well as trapping live birds and testing them for seroconversion ( a symptom of recent west nile virus infection ) are in place in centers of infection @xcite .",
    "the model that we develop for studies of the west nile virus epidemic is similar to the ak analysis of the hantavirus @xcite but incorporates the above as important additional features . from the point of view of modeling ,",
    "three additions to the ak model are crucial .",
    "the first is that there are _ two _ taxa in the west nile virus system ( mosquitoes and birds , as compared to the single rodent species in the hantavirus ) , that cross - infect each other .",
    "the second is that these two taxa have vastly different ( natural ) lifespans : the characteristic times are on the order of a few weeks for mosquitoes but on the order of a year or two for birds .",
    "the third is that while mice are never born infected with hantavirus , mosquitoes may be hatched west nile virus ; and while mice do not die from hanta infection , birds often do die from west nile virus infection .",
    "the first addition is treated in section  [ gen_model ] where we find obtain the generalized condition for steady state infection to exist for a system with two populations .",
    "the second addition is shown in section  [ realistic_model ] to lead to interesting consequences in the onset of the steady - state infection .",
    "the treatment of the third addition , also in section  [ realistic_model ] , shows that the increase in bird mortality due to infection can lead to oscillations in infected populations .",
    "the ak model equations , at the mean - field level ( at which diffusion is not shown explicitly ) , are    [ eq : ak ] @xmath1    where the subscripts @xmath2 and @xmath3 refer to infected and susceptible animals ( in this case , mice ) respectively , @xmath4 is the total population , @xmath5 the birth rate , @xmath6 the natural death rate , @xmath7 the environmental parameter , and @xmath8 is the transmission rate responsible for infection .    the fact , well - known to hantavirus biologists @xcite , that infection does not affect the lifespan of the infected mice , is naturally reflected in the mathematical observation that the total population @xmath9 is independent of all information regarding the infection process .",
    "the total population @xmath9 obeys a logistic equation , whose solution is known . noticing this , the solution of system ( [ eq : ak ] ) can be easily obtained analytically as shown by one of the present authors in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this suggests that we first recast the abramson - kenkre ( ak ) equations ( [ eq : ak ] ) , changing the variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 to the total population @xmath9 and the infected fraction @xmath12 .",
    "it is straightforward to write    [ eq : new_ak ] @xmath13    the first of these equations merely describes the logistic evolution of the total population .",
    "the second equation has an interesting structure .",
    "the two terms on the right side have opposite signs .",
    "the first term , @xmath14 , plays a role against infection because birth of new individuals always decreases the infected fraction @xmath15 : the offspring are always susceptible ( not infected ) .",
    "the second term , @xmath16 , represents the flux of individuals from susceptible to infected .",
    "this flux occurs as a result of transmission of infection between a susceptible individual and an infected one by direct contact . the transmission is represented by the product of the infected fraction , the susceptible fraction , and , of course , the total population .",
    "the system ( [ eq : new_ak ] ) has four equilibria .",
    "two of them are irrelevant because one is the null state and the other has negative population for all values of the parameters . with the help of a linear stability analysis @xcite of the equilibria",
    ", it can be shown that the other two equilibria interchange their stability character at a critical value of the parameter set .",
    "the state with infection different from zero ( @xmath17 ) is stable only if , as given in ref.@xcite , @xmath18 if this condition is not fulfilled , then the steady state has no infection , i.e. @xmath19 . equation ( [ eq : direct_infection ] ) also suggests an intuitive graphical procedure to ascertain the presence and magnitude of the infection .",
    "a plot of the @xmath15-dependence of each of the terms , @xmath20 ( straight line ) , and @xmath21 ( inverted shifted parabola ) indicates in the steady state the presence ( absence ) of infection if the two curves do ( do not ) intersect each other at a @xmath15 value other than @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig : balance ] . as @xmath23 evolves in time via its logistic equation , the term @xmath21 changes .",
    "if its initial and final values are small and large respectively , the nontrivial intersection of the curves ( nonzero @xmath15 ) will be absent at first , but present later on .",
    "[ fig : balance ] shows such a case .",
    "we have labeled the initial and final situations by @xmath22 and @xmath24 respectively , and the critical situation , wherein the nontrivial intersections just begins to appear , by the the time @xmath25 taken for it to occur .",
    "the time dependence of the infected fraction and the total population is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : caida ] .",
    "we notice the clear tendency of the infection first to disappear ( corresponding to the fact that the nontrivial intersection does not yet exist in fig .",
    "[ fig : balance ] ) followed by evolution to the eventual steady - state value ( corresponding to the intersection with the top curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : balance ] ) .     and represents the decrease of the infected fraction due to birth of susceptible individuals .",
    "the parabolas represent the transfer of infection and their strength is proportional to the total population @xmath9 .",
    "three cases are shown .",
    "the lowermost parabola describes the initial time @xmath26 at which no nonzero intersection exists .",
    "the topmost parabola describes the eventual situation at @xmath27 , i.e. , the steady state .",
    "the central parabola for which the straight line is a tangent describes the time at which the nontrivial intersection appears .",
    "this is the time @xmath25 at which the infection turns from its tendency to vanish and begins to rise to the nonzero steady state value.,width=576,height=384 ]     and the total population @xmath9 corresponding to the situations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : balance ] .",
    "parameters and initial conditions are arbitrary : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we see that @xmath15 first tends to vanish and then turns to its eventual steady state value .",

    ", width=576,height=384 ]    the delay @xmath25 in the onset of infection is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delaydirecto ] versus the dimensionless ratio of the two rates that enter into the balance as clear from equation ( 2b ) .",
    "an initial increase , a point of inflection , and an eventual blow - up at the point the rate ratio equals @xmath33 , are to be noted in the @xmath25 curve .",
    "the blow - up signals that the nontrivial intersection is always absent : the steady - state infection vanishes .     taken by the infected fraction to change its vanishing tendency and turn towards the nonzero steady state value plotted as a function of the ratio of the opposing rates @xmath5 and @xmath34 . in this simple case @xmath25",
    "is given by the analytic expression @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the critical carrying capacity . to be noted are the initial rise of @xmath25 , the point of inflection and the blow up at the right extreme which signifies that a nonzero infected fraction can not be supported at higher values of the abscissa .",
    "the delay time is plotted in units of @xmath32.,width=576,height=384 ]      unlike with the hantavirus , the spread of the west nile virus requires the presence of both mosquitoes and birds : the west nile virus is transmitted through cross - infection .",
    "this means that an infected individual infects a susceptible individual of the _ other _ taxon .",
    "a mosquito infects a bird and vice - versa .",
    "therefore , in place of the ak equations ( [ eq : ak ] ) , we write    [ eq : cross_infection_old ] @xmath37    where the subscripts @xmath2 and @xmath3 refer , as before , to the infected and susceptible state respectively .",
    "the symbol @xmath9 now represents mosquitoes rather than mice .",
    "the symbol @xmath38 ( after latin _ avis _ ) represents birds with @xmath39 as the birth rate , @xmath40 as the death rate , and @xmath41 as the environmental parameter .",
    "the rates are @xmath8 and @xmath42",
    ". equations ( [ eq : cross_infection_old ] ) are formally symmetric in the two taxa . in each case , infected as well as susceptible individuals breed susceptible individuals of their own species . also , in each case , infected individuals infect susceptible members of the _ other _ species .",
    "in addition , each species has its own vital dynamics ",
    "each modeled by a logistic equation  via its own birth rate , death rate , and environmental parameter . for",
    "the sake of explanation let us call one of the taxa ( i.e. , the birds ) the host population and the other ( i.e. , the mosquitoes ) the vector .",
    "an infected individual of the host population , @xmath43 , transmits the disease to a susceptible member of the vector taxon , @xmath11 .",
    "this member becomes infected , increasing the infected population of the vector taxon , @xmath10 . only then is this newly infected individual able to transmit the disease to a susceptible member of the original host population , @xmath44 .",
    "as a result of the last interaction , an individual of the host species will finally join the infected population @xmath43 .",
    "there is thus an underlying cyclic process . in this way",
    ", the infection process can be thought of in two stages .",
    "one is the acquisition of the infection by the ` vector ' .",
    "the other is the transmission to the ` host ' population .",
    "each of these requires direct contact between transmitter and receptor .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of each infection process depends on the number of receptors , the number of transmitters , and the respective infection rates .",
    "how is the equation set ( [ eq : new_ak ] ) augmented by the incorporation of cross - infection ? to answer this we rewrite equations ( [ eq : cross_infection_old ] ) in terms of total populations and infected fractions    [ eq : cross_infection ] @xmath45    we see that the evolution of the total population of the mosquitoes , @xmath46 , and of the birds , @xmath47 , is formally unchanged .",
    "the respective infected fractions @xmath48 and @xmath49 clearly show the effect of cross - infection . as in equations ( [ eq : new_ak ] ) , we see that the infected fraction of either taxon decreases as the result of births in that taxon because only susceptible individuals are born ( represented by the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 in ( [ eq : main_prop ] ) and ( [ eq : vector_prop ] ) respectively ) .    linear stability analysis @xcite of ( [ eq : cross_infection ] ) along the lines of ( [ eq : ak ] ) shows that the equilibria when infection is different from zero ( @xmath52 ) are stable only when @xmath53 equation ( [ eq : condicion2 ] ) represents a generalization of ( [ eq : condicion ] ) to the cross - infection case .",
    "threshold values for infection survival depend on products of quantities characteristic of the two taxa .",
    "the preceding analysis has focused on the consequence of replacing same - taxon infection by cross - infection typical of west nile virus and has relied on a highly simplified and symmetrical model .",
    "we now include three realistic features of the west nile virus : ( i ) the possibility of vertical transmission in mosquitoes , ( ii ) the possibility of infection - caused mortality of birds , and ( iii ) time scale disparity between mosquitoes and birds .",
    "vertical transmission has been strongly suspected in the west nile virus @xcite . by this term",
    "is meant the passage of virus from infected individuals to their offspring via the process of birth .",
    "therefore , we now consider that some of the offspring of infected mosquitoes are infected during the formation of eggs .",
    "we take the rate of mosquitoes being  born \" ( hatched ) already infected as @xmath54 .",
    "infected mosquitoes can only be born from infected mosquitoes .",
    "the total rate of mosquitoes born from infected ones is still @xmath5 . to incorporate this effect",
    ", we subtract the term @xmath55 from equation  ( [ eq : ci_ms ] ) and add it to the right - hand side of ( [ eq : ci_mi ] ) .",
    "while vertical transmission could lead to the survival of infection within mosquito larvae and reemerge in the spring , within the framework of equations we have adopted here , this modification has no important qualitative effect if @xmath56 , i.e , if not all offspring of infected mosquitoes are hatched infected .",
    "it only changes the critical values and the evolution times in a straightforward way .",
    "linear stability analysis @xcite shows that now the condition for the steady infected state is @xmath57 the asymmetry between the susceptible and infected populations , which favors the former as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : condicion2 ] ) , still holds provided @xmath58 .",
    "the modification in the bifurcation point is changed only quantitatively .",
    "by contrast to vertical transmission discussed above , the increase of the mortality rate in the bird population due to infection can have substantial consequences within our analytical framework .",
    "in addition to the vertical transmission modifications involving @xmath54 , we now replace @xmath59 in equation  ( [ eq : ci_ai ] ) by @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the infection - based contribution to the bird mortality rate .",
    "the generalization of equations ( [ eq : cross_infection ] ) is now    [ eq : final_system ] @xmath62    the condition for the stability of the state with nonzero infection is , @xmath63 the difference with the previous condition ( [ eq : condicion3 ] ) for linear stability of the infected state is the replacement of @xmath39 in the right side by @xmath64 .",
    "this result may appear puzzling . that a death rate contribution @xmath61 should _ add _ to , rather than subtract from , the birth rate @xmath39 may look counterintuitive .",
    "however , it arises simply from the fact that the relative increase of the number of susceptible over infected birds is a consequence of increased infected mortality as well as of the birth process for susceptible birds .",
    "a noteworthy outcome of the increase of mortality in birds due to infection is damped oscillations in @xmath65 as they approach their steady values .",
    "the mosquito population @xmath9 is not affected .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : damping ] this damped approach to equilibrium of the infected fractions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    ) from infection .",
    "time is plotted in units of @xmath68 .",
    "parameters are arbitrary : @xmath69,width=576,height=384 ]    the damped oscillations behavior does not require cross - infection as long as the extra death rate of infected individuals is present . indeed , the phenomenon can beunderstood more easily in the simpler case of direct infection .",
    "consider for this case    @xmath70    whereas the coefficient of the negative term @xmath71 in equation ( [ eq : damp_eq ] ) is fixed for all time @xmath31 , the transmission term is time dependent because of the time dependence of @xmath38 .",
    "that dependence is influenced , as ( [ eq : damp_eqa ] ) shows , by the evolution of the infected fraction @xmath15 through the extra death rate via the term ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "suppose that we are in a state in which the infected population is growing .",
    "while the amount of infected individuals increases , the number of deaths in population @xmath38 increases . thus , @xmath38 decreases . if the decay of the value of the total population @xmath38 is such that @xmath73 at some moment , the system will be in a situation wherein the infection is more likely to disappear than not .",
    "so , the infection decreases and the population recovers .",
    "this might be repeated several times until the system reaches the steady state .",
    "if , however , the extra death rate is high enough , oscillations might be completely suppressed and the infection may go directly to a steady state or disappear entirely .    the oscillations arise , thus , from the need of the presence of infection from transmission to occur , combined with the decrease in the population due to mortality from infection .",
    "this combination has another effect : the extra death rate parameter @xmath61 has an optimal value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal ] ) .",
    "if @xmath61 is too large , the infection is eliminated completely because the indispensable elements for transmission ( infected individuals ) are killed very quickly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal ] b ) .",
    "continuity of the infection requires a value for @xmath61 which provides the proper balance between the infection process and the death of infected birds .     on the steady state values of the total bird population and the infected fraction .",
    "the total population is expressed relative to the carrying capacity @xmath74 while the increased mortality rate @xmath61 is expressed relative to the rate difference @xmath75 .",
    "parameters are arbitrary : @xmath76 .",
    "the dependence of the infected fraction is monotonic while that of the total population has a minimum.,title=\"fig:\",width=576,height=384 ]   on the steady state values of the total bird population and the infected fraction .",
    "the total population is expressed relative to the carrying capacity @xmath74 while the increased mortality rate @xmath61 is expressed relative to the rate difference @xmath75 .",
    "parameters are arbitrary : @xmath76 .",
    "the dependence of the infected fraction is monotonic while that of the total population has a minimum.,title=\"fig:\",width=576,height=384 ]",
    "a peculiarity of the west nile virus epidemic is that processes involving mosquitoes and birds occur on quite different time scales .",
    "the natural lifespan of a mosquito is not generally longer than a month while that of a bird might be several years .",
    "the birth and death rates of one taxon are thus very different from those of the other taxon . in order to understand what effect this might produce on the dynamics of infection",
    ", we first make the simple assumption that the corresponding rates for the two taxa differ by a factor @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 we have followed several time scale separation schemes based on recasting the terms appearing in the evolution equations into those divided by @xmath77 and those independent of @xmath77 . for large time scale disparity , the former drop out of the evolution effectively .",
    "our studies of time scale disparity along these lines are of interest to the nonlinear dynamics of the system but appear so far to be of much less value to the understanding of the epidemic .",
    "therefore , we display here only the temporal evolution for two different values of @xmath77 ( see fig . [ fig : thre ] ) , and the corresponding interesting nonlinear dependence of the delay @xmath25 in the onset of steady state infection on @xmath77 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : delay ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : delay ] is the generalization of fig .",
    "[ fig : delaydirecto ] to the cross - infection situation present in the west nile virus epidemic . if the condition ( [ eq : condicion2 ] ) is fulfilled , the variables @xmath79 attain their limiting nonzero values as @xmath80 .",
    "however , as seen in fig .  [ fig : thre ] , for some initial amount of time , they could appear to be attracted to a state with no infection .",
    "a measure of this transient time can be estimated by noticing that the condition ( [ eq : condicion2 ] ) for the stability of the state with infection can be written as @xmath81 and asking for the value @xmath25 of the time @xmath31 at which this condition starts to be satisfied by the system .",
    "in other words , a measure of the delay @xmath25 can be obtained from @xmath82 because the functions @xmath83 and @xmath23 are known solutions of the logistic equation , we can solve this equation numerically . in this way",
    ", we can obtain the delay time @xmath25 as a function of @xmath77 for any initial conditions and parameter values .",

    "[ fig : delay ] . in changing @xmath77",
    "we keep the bird parameters constant and change only the mosquitoe rates .",
    "additionally , the environmental parameter of the mosquitoes , @xmath7 , is reduced by the same factor as @xmath77 is increased , in order to keep the carrying capacity @xmath84 constant .     and @xmath38 , and their respective infected fractions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : thre ] . sharply different rates of increase of the delay with the disparity factor are seen , along with a blow - up at the extreme right .",
    "the blow - up occurs at the critical value of @xmath92 , beyond which the state with nonzero infection can not be supported.,width=576,height=384 ]    the value of @xmath25 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delaydirecto ] is also obtained in this fashion although only a single population ( ratio ) enters in that case into the left ( right ) hand side of the criterion equation .",
    "the blow - up feature at the limiting values of the rate ratio is common to both the direct and the cross infection cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delaydirecto ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : delay ] ) .",
    "the strong non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath25 in the cross - infection case is interesting and merits further study .",
    "further time scale disparity conclusions can not be drawn until the relative values of the cross - infection parameters are known .",
    "thus , it is possible to recast the equations of the mosquito and bird populations in dimensionless form to make clear the time scale disparity obvious from the numerical solutions displayed in the figures . defining @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the mosquito carrying capacity @xmath84 and @xmath74 is the bird carrying capacity @xmath96 , evolution equations for the total populations in terms of the dimensionless time @xmath97 take the form    @xmath98    the time rate of change of the bird population is clearly slower than of the mosquito population by the disparity factor .",
    "this agrees with the quick rise of the mosquito population displayed in the figures .",
    "however , whether the infection ratios change on the same or disparate time scales depends on the relative values of the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "if they are of the same order as each other , bird infection will involve on a slower time scale than mosquito infection .",
    "for values we have taken to draw the plots displayed , both infected fractions appear to evolve on the same time scale .    there is another time scale disparity comment worth making .",
    "the short - time part of any logistic evolution is exponential increase .",
    "observation times of interest in the kind of west nile virus studies we have discussed in this paper are typically short on bird time scales .",
    "they are , however , not short on mosquito time scales .",
    "therefore , the total bird population @xmath83 might be taken to be @xmath101 to a good aprroximnation .",
    "the total mosquito population @xmath23 should not be approximated in this manner .",
    "in this paper we have presented some essential features of a theoretical framework to analyze the spread of the west nile virus epidemic . explaining existing data has not been our aim because such data are rather scarce . starting with the ak equations given earlier for hantavirus investigations @xcite ,",
    "we have developed the west nile virus theory in three stages .",
    "first , we modified the hantavirus equations ( [ eq : ak ] ) by replacing same - taxon infection by cross - infection , peculiar to the west nile virus . at this stage , we retained hantavirus features by assuming that all susceptible organisms have comparable lifespans , no organisms are born infected , and the infection does not affect the death rate of members of either taxon .",
    "our results ( equations [ eq : cross_infection_old ] and [ eq : cross_infection ] ) showed that the condition for steady - state infection is a generalization from the one obtained for the hantavirus ( no cross - infection ) , involving a combination of the parameter of the two taxa .    in the second stage , we studied realistic features of the west nile virus by including an analysis of vertical transmission for the mosquitoes , and increased mortality rate in birds due to infection .",
    "we found that vertical transmission does not affect the qualitative behavior of the system within the framework of equations we have adopted .",
    "however , we found that damped oscillations in the evolution emerge from the increased mortality rate in birds due to infection .",
    "furthermore , we saw that , while the dependence of the infected fraction of birds on the increased mortality rate is monotonic , the dependence of the total bird population is not , there being a characteristic value at which the maximum number of birds are killed . for lower as well as higher values of the mortality rate ,",
    "the bird population is larger .",
    "finally , we found that disparate lifespans of mosquitoes and birds lead to the effect that the delay in the onset of steady - state of infection depends nonlinearly on the ratio of the characteristic times of the two taxa .",
    "the third stage of our investigations addresses an important feature of the west nile virus epidemic : the _ movement _ of mosquitoes and birds , particularly the _ migration _ of birds .",
    "because this stage has not been completed , we have not presented our results in this paper .",
    "however we state here the basic idea and the equations we use for this purpose .",
    "the equations are      the movement of the mosquitoes is considered diffusive and represented by the diffusion constant @xmath103 while the long range movement of birds ( including , particularly , migration ) is represented by the integral terms involving @xmath104 .",
    "information about the speed at which mosquitoes move , as well as their effectively enhanced mobility due to wind and related effects , is fed into @xmath103 .",
    "an alternative to the integral description of the long - range motion of birds given above is a treatment through a partially systematic and partially stochastic term representing the appearance and disappearance of birds ( and infection ) at the site under investigation , as a result of their migration .",
    "another important feature missing from the work reported in the present paper is the seasonal disappearance of mosquitoes , an essential part of the conduit of infection , when the temperature drops below that capable of sustaining them .",
    "yet another is the possible of reemergence of infection in the spring from infected larvae .",
