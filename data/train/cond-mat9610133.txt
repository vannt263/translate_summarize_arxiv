    "accurate experimental studies of magnetic systems on the one hand , and series expansion studies of model spin systems on the other , providing vivid illustration of the phenomena of scaling and universality , already hinted at previously by guggenheim for fluids @xcite .",
    "these findings heralded the beginning of a prodigious effort to understand more deeply the nature of critical phenomena , and in particular of finding ways of dealing with the profusion of length scales that characterise the critical region and which underpin the singularities in physical observables that are its hallmark .",
    "milestones in this quest to date , are the renormalisation group @xcite and conformal invariance theories @xcite , the introduction of which have added substantially to the armoury of the critical point theorist .    notwithstanding the great strides made in the understanding of critical phenomena over recent years , it is the exception rather than the rule that the available theoretical apparatus permits exact calculation of the critical properties of a given model system . many of the systems of interest to physicists have steadfastly resisted efforts to find accurate analytical treatments of their critical properties .",
    "indispensable , therefore , in tackling these analytically recalcitrant models has been computer simulation .",
    "methods such as finite - size scaling or the monte - carlo renormalisation group permit one , in principle , to extract accurate estimates for bulk critical properties from simulations of finite - sized systems . until recently",
    ", however , such simulation studies of critical phenomena were principally confined to simple lattice - based magnetic systems like the @xmath0 or q - state potts models .",
    "more complex systems such as off - lattice fluids were deemed to be simply too computationally demanding .",
    "gradually , though , and with the advent of new simulation methodologies , and ever more powerful computers , this situation is changing and it is now becoming possible to perform detailed simulation investigations of critical phenomena in a variety of simple and complex fluid systems .",
    "these developments are opening up for simulation study , a whole new vista of interesting critical and phase coexistence behaviour .",
    "phenomena of topical interest encompass not only the standard liquid - vapour or liquid - liquid ( consolute ) critical phenomena , but also multicritical and crossover behaviour in diverse classes of systems ranging from simple atomic fluids to electrolytes and polymer blends .",
    "in this article we review recent progress in the simulation of bulk criticality in model fluid systems .",
    "we begin by describing recent advances in finite - size scaling ( fss ) theory for fluids .",
    "these advances generalise the fss techniques previously developed in the magnetic context in order to take account of the ` field mixing ' phenomenon that manifests the lack of symmetry between coexisting fluid phases .",
    "this broken symmetry , which is a fundamental issue in the critical behaviour of fluids , is shown to have important consequences for simulation measurements of quantities such as the particle density , or the specific heat .",
    "the relationship to experimental studies of field mixing is also discussed .",
    "we then describe a simulation methodology based on the insights derived from the fss theory , and illustrate its utility by describing , in some detail , recent studies of critical phenomena in the lennard - jones fluid and tricritical phenomena in a two - dimensional spin fluid model .",
    "attention is also drawn to recent fss studies of critical behaviour in polymer blends and solutions .",
    "finally we assess the prospects for further work in the field and highlight a number of outstanding unresolved issues .",
    "in the neighbourhood of a critical point , the correlation length @xmath1 grows extremely large and often exceeds the linear size @xmath2 of the simulated system .",
    "when this occurs , the singularities and discontinuities that characterise critical phenomena in the thermodynamic limit are smeared out and shifted @xcite .",
    "unless care is exercised , such finite - size effects can lead to serious errors in computer simulation estimates of critical point parameters .    to deal with these problems , finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "use of fss methods enable one to extract accurate estimates of infinite - volume quantities from simulations of finite - size . as its basic tenet",
    ", the fss hypothesis holds that for sufficiently large @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the coarse - grained properties of a given near - critical system are universal @xcite and depend ( up to certain non - universal factors ) only on specific combinations of @xmath2 and the relevant scaling fields that measure deviations from criticality @xcite .",
    "systems having short - ranged interactions and a single component order - parameter ( such as many fluids and magnets ) belong to the ising universality class @xcite , ie .",
    "their scaling functions and critical exponents are identical to those of the simple ising model .",
    "however , qualitatively different systems , such as those with multi - component order - parameters may exhibit quite different universal behaviour .    for the purpose of setting out the general fss concepts",
    ", however , we shall remain with the ising universality class , for which the critical behaviour is controlled by two relevant scaling fields , which we denote  and . for the ising model itself , ( or equivalently , the ordinary lattice gas )",
    "there is a special ` particle - hole ' symmetry with respect to change of sign of the magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "this symmetry implies that fluctuations in the order - parameter @xmath4 , and the energy density @xmath5 are orthogonal ( statistically independent ) , ie .",

    "the subscripts c in equations  [ eq : deltops ] signify that the averages are to be taken at criticality .",
    "the forms of the @xmath2 dependences of the operator distributions in equation  [ eq : lamdefs ] arise from the relationship between the correlation length @xmath1 , and the system size .",
    "for example , in the case of the ordering operator , one has @xmath18 .",
    "since , however , at criticality , the correlation length is bounded by @xmath2 , one can simply substitute @xmath19 , giving @xmath20 .",
    "a similar arguement pertains to @xmath21 . to obtain the dependence of the operator distributions on the scaling fields",
    ", one assumes that the scaling behaviour depends solely on the ratio @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "although the generality of the fss expression , equation  [ eq : ansatz ] , encompasses all members of the ising universality class , irrespective of the symmetry between the coexisting phases , it has long been appreciated @xcite that the _ form _ of the fluid scaling fields differ from those of the ising model . specifically , the reduced symmetry of fluids ( ie . the fact that @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the density ) leads to ` mixed ' scaling fields comprising _ linear - combinations _ of the reduced coupling in this definition of the scaling fields , rather than the temperature itself . both definitions",

    "the typical size of the fluctuations in the ordering operator , on the other hand , vary like @xmath45 . from this",
    "it is is easy to show @xcite that for a given @xmath2 , the shape of the energy and density distributions can be identified with the distribution of the variable    @xmath46    with    @xmath47    where the subscripts @xmath36 and @xmath29 signify that the value of @xmath48 corresponds to the energy density and particle density distributions respectively .",
    "the distributions @xmath49 constitute a spectrum of _ universal _ functions ( parameterised by the value of @xmath48 ) describing the particle density and energy distributions of fluids at finite @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath2 dependence arises from the different relative strengths of the critical fluctuations in  and . since @xmath50 ,",
    "the critical fluctuations in  are stronger than those in , causing the distribution  to converge to its average value more rapidly with increasing @xmath2 , than .",
    "consequently , measurements of the distributions of @xmath29 and @xmath36 , ( each of which represent linear combinations of  and ) , yield @xmath2-dependent functional forms .",
    "figure  [ fig : projs ] shows the form of @xmath49 for a representative selection of values of @xmath48 .",
    "the distributions were constructed from the joint distribution @xmath51 of the critical ising model obtained in reference @xcite . since for the ising model , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,",
    "the form of @xmath49 is obtained simply by taking linear combinations of the form @xmath54 . for @xmath55 this yields , trivially , the ordering operator distribution @xmath56 , while for @xmath57 the form is that of the energylike operator distribution @xmath58 .",
    "intermediate between these values a range of behaviour is obtained , representing the finite @xmath2 forms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 for fluids . of course , since @xmath61 is universal , then so also are all the finite - size forms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    in the limit @xmath62 ,",
    "equation  [ eq : ldep ] implies that both @xmath63 and @xmath64 approach zero so that @xmath65 it follows that for _ any _ finite  and , the limiting critical point forms of @xmath66 and @xmath60 both match the critical ordering operator distribution = @xmath67  @xmath68 .",
    "this result reflects the fact that for sufficiently large @xmath2 , the critical fluctuations in  are negligible on the scale of those in",
    ". it should be noted , however , that a quite different state of affairs obtains for the critical ising model where , owing to the absence of field mixing ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 .",
    "this alteration to the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath60 turns out to have important ramifications for the manner in which the specific heat is measured . within the canonical ensemble of the ising model ,",
    "the specific heat is most readily calculated from the variance of the energy fluctuations , which at criticality scales with system size like    @xmath71    for fluids , however , this is not the correct definition to use since the alteration to the limiting form of @xmath60 implies that @xmath72 which scales asymptotically like the ising _ susceptibility _",
    "( fluid compressibility ) . to recapture the ising behaviour",
    "it is instead necessary to consider the fluctuations of the energy - like _ operator _",
    "@xmath73    further practical consequences of field mixing are to be found in the finite - size behaviour of the average values of the critical density and energy . specifically , recall that    @xmath74    now , on symmetry grounds , the value of @xmath75 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "however , no such symmetry condition pertains to , whose average value @xmath76 at criticality varies with system size like    @xmath77    implying the same behaviour for the energy and particle densities : @xmath78 thus , even with precise knowledge of the location of the critical point , a single measurement can not yield accurate estimates of the infinite volume values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "instead these quantities must be estimated by employing the above scaling relations to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit data from a number of different system sizes @xcite .",
    "it should also be pointed out , that the finite - size scaling expression , equation  [ eq : critlim ] , is strictly only valid in the limit of large @xmath2 . for smaller system sizes ,",
    "one anticipates that corrections to finite - size scaling associated with non - vanishing values of the _ irrelevant _ scaling fields will become significant @xcite .",
    "these irrelevant fields take the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the universal correction to scaling exponent , whose value has been estimated to be @xmath83 for the 3d ising class @xcite . incorporating the least irrelevant of these corrections into equation  [ eq : critlim ] , one obtains @xcite    @xmath84    as we shall see in section  [ sec : lj ]",
    ", it is necessary to take account of such corrections to scaling , if highly accurate estimates of the critical parameters are desired .    finally in this section",
    ", we note that the above treatment has been developed ( primarily for reasons of clarity ) in terms of pure fluids of the ising class .",
    "more generally though , the critical phenomena for a given fluid system of interest may be different .",
    "thus for example the critical behaviour of a binary mixture may be ising like , but one must allow in general for critical fluctuations both in the composition and in the total density . in this case the two scaling fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 will comprise linear combinations of the three physical field i.e the temperature , the chemical potential of one species , and the difference in chemical potential between the two species @xcite .",
    "alternatively one may encounter a different universality class altogether , which may have more than just two relevant scaling fields .",
    "examples are ternary mixtures of fluids or spin fluids ( like that considered in section  [ sec : tricrit ] ) which , by virtue of their coupled order - parameters , exhibit tricritical phenomena . in such cases",
    "the tricritical behaviour is characterised by three or more scaling fields , each of which comprises ( in general ) linear combinations of the physical fields .",
    "the nature and number of these physical fields will , of course , depend upon the specific system under consideration .",
    "[ sec : expt ]    experimental studies of critical phenomena in fluids have a long and distinguished history , which it would be impossible to review here in any great detail .",
    "instead we refer the reader to the recent book by anisimov @xcite for a comprehensive treatment . here",
    "we shall focus on just one aspect of fluid criticality , namely the field mixing phenomenon . in so doing we shall try to emphasise that simulation can often achieve much more than just mimicking experiment .",
    "specifically we argue that by _ exploiting _ , rather than simply trying to minimise finite - size effects , one can often circumvent the difficulties encountered experimentally .",
    "although theoretical predictions concerning the existence of field mixing were confirmed experimentally quite some time ago @xcite , it has always proved rather difficult to obtain accurate experimental data for quantities such as the field mixing parameters .",
    "the chief problem is that of the weakness of the field mixing signature in the experimentally measurable observables .",
    "by contrast , a simulation is rather less hamstrung because it permits direct access to _ all _ physical observables of relevance  notably the exact instantaneous values of the particle and energy density , the coupling of which manifests the field mixing phenomenon .",
    "moreover , the finite - size of the system , which oftens bedevils computer simulation studies of critical phenomena , turns out to be a positive boon for field mixing studies . for finite - sized systems , field mixing contributes an @xmath2-dependent correction to the limiting forms of @xmath66 and @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : back ] ) .",
    "the effect of decreasing the system size is thus to _ magnify _ the size of the field mixing signature in these distributions .",
    "of course the system size should nt be too small , or else corrections to finite - size scaling will become significant . in most cases ,",
    "though , it turns out to be possible to attain sufficiently large system sizes so that corrections to scaling are minimised , while nevertheless retaining clear field mixing effects in @xmath66 and @xmath60 . as a result ( and as we will demonstrate in the next section ) , it is in most cases relatively easy to measure accurately the field mixing parameters for the system of interest .",
    "the situation for experiments is more complicated @xcite .",
    "there one essentially operates in the thermodynamic limit and typically has access only to bare observables such as the time - averaged density , or response functions such as the isothermal compressibility or isochoric specific heat . for the density , the appearance of the energy operator in equation  [ eq : udenmix ] leads to the celebrated singularity in the coexistence diameter @xcite :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is a constant representing the ` rectilinear diameter ' and @xmath87 is closely related to the field mixing parameter @xmath34",
    "unfortunately , owing to the smallness of the exponent @xmath88 for fluids of the ising universality class , the power of the singular term is close to that of the leading regular term . unless extremely small reduced temperatures are attained , the two terms are difficult to distinguish experimentally .",
    "further complications derive from gravity - induced density gradients in the experimental sample ( which are magnified by the large near - critical compressibility ) , as well as hydrodynamic effects and convection currents @xcite .",
    "steps must be taken either to minimise these effects during the experiment , or to correct for them in the data analysis .",
    "owing to these difficulties , relatively few experiments @xcite have been able to convincingly identify the diameter singularity at all , let alone obtain accurate values for the field mixing parameter @xmath34 .",
    "however , it is doubtful whether a simulation would fare much better in attempting to investigate field mixing in this manner , even without the problems of spurious sample inhomogeneities .",
    "the situation with regard to obtaining field mixing properties from experimental measurements of the response functions , is also far from straightforward .",
    "the generalised compressibility and specific heat are defined with respect to the scaling field derivatives of the operators , whose singular behaviour is :    @xmath89    which are the scaling equivalents for fluids of the ising susceptibility and specific heat respectively . for pure fluids , however , the response functions measured in practice are the isothermal compressibility and isochoric specific heat : @xmath90 asymptotically , it can be shown that these exhibit the same scaling behaviour as the generalised response functions of equation  [ eq : response ] . the only residual effect of field mixing is to be found in additional non - asymptotic ( sub - dominant ) contributions",
    "specifically , one finds @xcite :    @xmath91    in practice , though , it seems difficult to unambiguously separate the asymptotic and non - asymptotic terms from one another and from standard corrections to scaling in the experimental data .",
    "in this section we illustrate the practical application of the finite - size scaling concepts outlined in section  [ sec : back ] .",
    "we do so by reviewing ( in some detail ) two recent simulation studies that have applied fss analyses to investigate fluid critical behaviour .",
    "the first system considered in subsection  [ sec : lj ] , is the well known lennard - jones fluid .",
    "we demonstrate how measurements of the scaling operator distributions can be analysed within the fss framework to yield highly accurate estimates for the limiting critical point parameters of this model .",
    "we then turn to a more complicated system , namely a two - dimensional spin fluid exhibiting a tricritical point .",
    "we show how the fss concepts can be extended to incorporate the added complexity of tricritical phenomena , and detail simulation results for the model . finally in section  [ sec : complex ] we consider recent applications of fss techniques to simulation studies of critical polymer blends and solutions .",
    "we begin , however , by briefly discussing some issues relating to the choice of simulation ensemble .      the benefits that accrue from a fss analysis of criticality in fluids are to a large extent contingent upon the choice of simulation ensemble to be used .",
    "crucial to the viability of the study is a choice of ensemble that adequately provides for the strong near - critical order - parameter fluctuations . for liquid - vapour transitions , which are principally characterised by density fluctuations , monte - carlo simulations @xcite within the grand canonical ensemble ( constant @xmath92-ensemble ) @xcite",
    "have proved a highly effective approach .",
    "the strength of the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) stems from the freedom of the _ total _ particle number to fluctuate @xcite .",
    "consequently , the near - critical density fluctuations are observable on the largest possible length scale , namely that of the system itself . in principle , though , it is also possible to perform a fss analysis in the canonical @xmath93-ensemble ( in which the total density is fixed ) , by studying density fluctuations within _ sub - blocks _ of the total system @xcite .",
    "however as described in references  @xcite , this approach is plagued with practical difficulties and seems to be computationally very intensive .",
    "the results emerging from such studies have , to date , not been of comparable quality to those obtained from gce studies .",
    "another alternative approach for dealing with density fluctuations , is to employ a constant pressure ( @xmath94 ) ensemble @xcite . here , the total particle number @xmath95 is held constant , but the density can fluctuate by means of volume transitions .",
    "although fss usually rest upon the idea of comparing the correlation length to the ( fixed ) linear size of the system , its use has recently been extended to the @xmath94-ensemble @xcite by expressing the scaling properties not in terms of powers of @xmath2 , but in powers of @xmath95 .",
    "however , while fully feasible as a method for studying liquid - vapour criticality , this approach was found ( for various technical reasons ) to be less efficient than use of the gce for the study of simple atomic fluids @xcite .",
    "it should nevertheless prove beneficial when dealing with systems such as polymer solutions or electrolyte models for which the gce particle insertion probability can be prohibitively small .",
    "for liquid - liquid transitions , the near - critical region is characterised by strong concentration fluctuations . in a simulation one typically considers two species of particles ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) and common practice is to maintain the total particle number , @xmath98 , constant .",
    "the analogue of the gce in this case is the semi - grand canonical ensemble ( sgce ) , in which concentration fluctuations are realised by means of monte - carlo moves that swop the identity of particles @xmath99 or @xmath100 , under the control of a parameter representing the chemical potential difference between the two species .",
    "the sgce approach has recently been successfully employed in conjunction with a fss analysis of the ordering operator distribution @xmath56 , to study critical phenomena in a symmetric mixtures of square - well particles @xcite and in the widom - rowlinson model @xcite .",
    "the approach can also be extended to asymmetric mixtures ( where field mixing effects must be taken into consideration ) and even to asymmetric polymer blends as described in section  [ sec : complex ] .",
    "most of the recent work on fluid phase coexistence has been performed using the gibbs ensemble monte - carlo ( gemc ) method .",
    "this technique , details and applications of which are reviewed in reference @xcite , is very useful for mapping out the phase coexistence envelope well away from criticality .",
    "however , in its most commonly practiced form , the method obtains estimates for the critical parameters by extrapolating a power law to coexistence curve data obtained well away from the immediate vicinity of the critical point . due to various pitfalls of this approach @xcite ,",
    "it has thus far not proved able to provide more than rough estimates of critical point parameters .",
    "it is also not clear how the gemc method can be combined with fss techniques . for these reasons we will not consider such studies further here .",
    "the lennard - jones ( lj ) fluid , is arguably the simplest model with the credentials ( notably the symmetry ) of a realistic atomic fluid .",
    "its interparticle potential takes the form :    @xmath101\\label{eq : ljdef}\\ ] ]    where @xmath102 is the well - depth ( which also defines the reduced temperature @xmath103 ) , and @xmath104 is a scale parameter .",
    "simulations of the lj system have recently been carried out using a metropolis algorithm @xcite within the grand canonical ensemble @xcite . as is common practice ,",
    "the lennard - jones potential was truncated at a cutoff radius @xmath105 , and the potential left unshifted .",
    "five system sizes were studied corresponding to @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "the observables recorded in the course of the simulations , were the reduced particle density , @xmath108 and the dimensionless energy density @xmath109 , where @xmath110 .",
    "the joint distribution @xmath111 was accumulated in the form of a histogram .",
    "a number of preliminary short runs were made for the @xmath112 system size in order to locate the liquid - vapour coexistence curve using a previous simulation estimate of the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by tuning the chemical potential @xmath113 until the density distribution exhibited a double peaked structure indicative of phase coexistence .",
    "histogram reweighting @xcite was then used in order to explore the coexistence curve in the neighbourhood of this simulation temperature .",
    "such a reweighting scheme , use of which is now standard practice in simulation studies of critical phenomena , allows histograms of observables obtained at one given @xmath114 and @xmath31 to be reweighted to yield estimates corresponding to another @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    to obtain a preliminary estimate of the critical point parameters , the universal matching condition for the ordering operator distribution was invoked . as observed in section  [ sec : back ] , fluid ",
    "magnet universality implies that the critical fluid ordering operator distribution  must match the universal fixed point function = @xmath117  @xmath68 appropriate to the ising universality class .",
    "this latter function is independently known from detailed ising model studies @xcite .",
    "thus the apparent critical parameters of the fluid can be estimated by tuning the temperature , chemical potential and field mixing parameter @xmath34 ( within the reweighting scheme ) until  collapses onto .",
    "the result of applying this procedure for the @xmath112 data set is displayed in figure  [ fig : om_m4 ] , where the data has been expressed in terms of the scaling variable @xmath118 and in line with convention , scaled to unit norm and variance .",
    "the accord shown corresponds to a choice of the apparent critical parameters @xmath119 .    using this estimate of the critical point",
    ", more extensive simulations were performed for each of the @xmath120 systems sizes , thus facilitating a full fss analysis .",
    "reweighting was again applied to the resulting histograms in order to effect the matching of  to , thus yielding values of the apparent critical parameters .",
    "interestingly , however , the apparent critical parameters determined in this manner were found to be @xmath2-_dependent_. the reason for this turns out to be significant contributions to the measured histograms from corrections to scaling ( cf .",
    "equation  [ eq : cts ] ) , manifest as an @xmath2-dependent discrepancy between the critical operator distributions and their limiting fixed - point forms . in the case of the ordering operator distribution",
    ", the symmetry of the ising problem implies that the correction to scaling function is symmetric in @xmath121 . in implementing the matching to , one thus necessarily introduces an _ additional _ symmetric contribution to  associated with a finite value of the scaling field .",
    "this latter contribution has , coincidentally , a form that is very similar to that of the correction to scaling function , a fact that makes the cancellation of contributions possible .",
    "it follows , therefore , that the magnitude of the two contributions must be approximately equal .",
    "notwithstanding the complications engendered by corrections to scaling , it is nevertheless possible to extract accurate estimates of the infinite - volume critical parameters from the measured histograms .",
    "the key to accomplishing this is the known scaling behaviour of the corrections to scaling , which die away with increasing system size like @xmath122 ( cf . equation  [ eq : cts ] ) . since contributions to  from finite values of , grow with system size like @xmath123 , it follows that implementation of the matching condition leads to a deviation of the apparent critical temperature @xmath124 from the true critical temperature @xmath125 which behaves like    @xmath126    in figure  [ fig : tc_extrap ] the apparent critical temperature @xmath127 is plotted as a function of @xmath128 .",
    "clearly the data are indeed very well described by a linear dependence , the least squares extrapolation of which yields the infinite - volume estimate @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding estimate for the critical chemical potential is @xmath130 .",
    "the size and character of the contribution of corrections to scaling to the operator distributions can be seen by plotting their forms at the estimated infinite - volume values of @xmath125 and @xmath131 .",
    "considering first the ordering operator distribution , figure  [ fig : om+oe](a ) shows the critical point form of @xmath56 [ expressed in terms of the scaling variable @xmath132 , for the two system sizes @xmath112 and @xmath133 .",
    "also shown is the universal fixed point function @xmath134 .",
    "the corrections to scaling , manifest in the discrepancy between the fluid finite - size data and the limiting form , are clearly evident in the figure , especially for the @xmath112 system size .",
    "the corresponding situation for the energy operator distribution @xmath135 is shown in figure  [ fig : om+oe](b ) , which is plotted together with the limiting fixed point function @xmath136 , identifiable as the critical energy distribution of the ising model , and independently known from detailed ising model studies @xcite .",
    "the data have all been expressed in terms of the scaling variable @xmath137 . in this case",
    ", one observes that the corrections to scaling are noticeably larger than for @xmath56 , a fact that presumably reflects the relative weakness of critical fluctuations in @xmath21 compared to those in @xmath35 .",
    "the values of the critical point field mixing parameters ,  and , are implicit in the ordering operator distribution .",
    "their values may be estimated ( cf .",
    "reference  @xcite ) by treating each as a fit parameter which is tuned to best optimise the mapping of the critical operator distributions onto their limiting fixed point forms , ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : om_m4 ] ) .",
    "the resulting estimates were , however , found to be slightly @xmath2-dependent for the smaller system sizes , an effect that presumably stems from corrections to scaling . for the two largest system sizes , though , this @xmath2-dependence is small and the estimates @xmath138 , @xmath139 were obtained .",
    "addressing now the critical density and energy distributions , figure  [ fig : rho+en ] shows the measured forms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 at the assigned values of the critical parameters . to varying degrees ,",
    "these distributions are asymmetric , a fact which as explained in section  [ sec : back ] stems from field mixing effects .",
    "indeed , the forms of the distributions are consistent with those shown in figure  [ fig : projs ] .",
    "the magnitude of the asymmetry also clearly dies away with increasing @xmath2 , as predicted , although the system sizes are still too small to reveal the limiting behaviour @xmath140 . in figure",
    "[ fig : rho+en_extrap ] , the values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 corresponding to the distributions of figure  [ fig : rho+en ] , are plotted as a function of @xmath143 ( c.f .",
    "equation  [ eq : en+rho ] ) .",
    "although no allowances have been made for corrections to scaling ( the effects of which are certainly much smaller than those of field mixing ) , the data exhibit , within the uncertainties , a rather clear linear dependence .",
    "least - squares fits to the data yield the infinite volume estimates @xmath144 .",
    "the finite - size scaling behaviour of @xmath56 and @xmath58 at the critical point , also serve to furnish estimates of the exponent ratios @xmath145 and @xmath146 characterising the two relevant scaling fields @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "consideration of the scaling form  [ eq : critlim ] shows that the typical size of the critical fluctuations in the energy - like operator will vary with system size like @xmath147 , while the typical size of the fluctuations in the ordering operator vary like @xmath148 .",
    "comparison of the standard deviation of these distributions as a function of system size thus affords estimates of the appropriate exponent ratios . in order to minimise systematic errors arising from corrections to scaling",
    ", this comparison was performed only for the two largest system sizes @xmath149 and @xmath133 . from the measured variance of @xmath56 for these two systems ,",
    "the estimate @xmath150 was obtained .",
    "this compares most favourably with the three dimensional ( 3d ) ising estimate @xcite of @xmath151 .",
    "given though that no allowances were made for corrections to scaling , the quality of this accord is perhaps slightly fortuitous .",
    "implementing an analogous procedure for @xmath58 , yields the estimate @xmath152 , which does not agree to within error with the 3d ising estimate @xmath153 . in this case , however , it is likely that the bulk of the discrepancy is traceable to the high sensitivity of @xmath154 with respect to the designation of the field mixing parameter @xmath38 implicit in the definition of @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "equation  [ eq : oplinks ] ) . in the presence of sizable corrections",
    "to scaling , it is somewhat difficult to gauge very accurately the infinite volume value of @xmath38 from the mapping of @xmath58 onto @xmath155 .",
    "studies of significantly larger system sizes than considered here would be necessary to alleviate this problem .      as the second example of fluid critical behaviour we consider the phase behaviour of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ` spin fluid ' , i.e. a 2d fluid of particles , each of which possesses a spin degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "physically , such a model is representative of a fluid of magnetic molecules lightly absorbed onto a smooth substrate @xcite . owing to the coupling of the magnetism and density fluctuations , however , the phase properties of spin fluids are completely different from those of non - magnetic simple fluids @xcite such as the lj system .",
    "the simplest spin fluid model is a system of hard discs , each of which carries a spin@xmath156 magnetic moment .",
    "such a system has a configurational energy given by :    @xmath157    with @xmath158 , @xmath159 is a hard disc potential with diameter @xmath104 , and @xmath3 is an applied magnetic field .",
    "the distant - dependent spin coupling parameter @xmath160 is assigned a square well form :    @xmath161    the schematic phase diagram of this model in zero field ( @xmath7 ) is depicted in figure  [ fig : pdschem ] . for high temperatures , there exists a line of ising critical points ( the so - called ` critical line ' ) separating a ferromagnetic fluid phase from a paramagnetic fluid phase .",
    "the particle density varies continuously across this line .",
    "as one follows the critical line to lower temperatures , the size of the particle density fluctuations grows progressively . at some point ,",
    "the fluctuations in both the particle density and magnetisation are simultaneously divergent and the system is tricritical @xcite .",
    "lowering the temperature still further results in a phase separation between a low density paramagnetic gas and a high density ferromagnetic liquid .",
    "for subtricritical temperatures , the phase transition between these two phases is first order .",
    "owing to the interplay between the density and magnetisation fluctuations , the tricritical properties of the spin fluid are expected to differ qualitatively from those on the critical line .",
    "general universality arguments @xcite predict that for a given spatial dimensionality , fluids with short - ranged interactions should exhibit the same tricritical properties as lattice - based spin systems such as the spin-@xmath162 blume - capel model @xcite .",
    "however , since spin fluids possess a continuous translational symmetry that lattice models do not , this proposal needs to be checked .",
    "in addition is if of interest to obtain the field mixing parameters of the model and compare them with those for a simple critical fluid .    before proceeding however ,",
    "it is necessary to generalise somewhat the fss equations of section  [ sec : back ] , in order to account for the fact that the tricritical point has not two relevant scaling field , but three . in general these scaling fields ( which we denote @xmath163 and @xmath164 )",
    "are expected to comprise linear combinations of the three thermodynamic fields @xmath165 , @xmath31 and @xmath3 . for the spin fluid model considered here ,",
    "however , the configurational energy is invariant with respect to sign reversal of the spin degrees of freedom and magnetic field .",
    "this special symmetry implies that the tricritical point lies in the symmetry plane @xmath7 , and that the scaling field @xmath164 coincides with the magnetic field @xmath3 , being orthogonal to the @xmath166 plane containing the other two scaling fields , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "thus one can write    @xmath169    where the subscript @xmath170 signifies tricritical values and the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath38 are field mixing parameters , controlling the directions of the scaling fields in the @xmath31@xmath30 plane . the scaling fields @xmath167 and @xmath168 are depicted schematically in figure  [ fig : pdschem](b ) .",
    "one sees that @xmath167 is tangent to the coexistence curve at the tricritical point @xcite , so that the field mixing parameter @xmath38 may be identified simply as the limiting tricritical gradient of the coexistence curve .",
    "the scaling field @xmath168 , on the other hand , is permitted to take a general direction in the @xmath31@xmath30 plane and is not constrained to coincide with any special direction of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "conjugate to each of the scaling fields are scaling operators , the form of which are given by    @xmath171 \\\\",

    "ansatz _ for the limiting ( large l ) near - tricritical distribution of @xmath173    @xmath174    where @xmath175 is a universal scaling function , the @xmath176 are non - universal metric factors and the @xmath177 are the standard tricritical eigenvalue exponents @xcite , which in analogy to equation  [ eq : ansatz ] can be expressed in terms of ratios of the various tricritical exponents characterising the behaviour of @xmath29,@xmath172 and @xmath1 in the neighbourhood of the tricritical point .    precisely at the tricritical point ,",
    "the tricritical scaling fields vanish identically and the last three arguments of equation  [ eq : ansatz_t ] can be simply dropped , yielding    @xmath178    where @xmath179 is a universal and scale invariant function characterising the tricritical fixed point . in what follows",
    "we describe how the tricritical point of the 2d spin fluid model was located by means of simulation , and how the proposed universality of equation  [ eq : ptri ] was tested by obtaining the form of @xmath179 and comparing it with that for the tricritical 2d blume - capel model whose hamiltonian is given by    @xmath180    where @xmath181 is the so - called crystal field ( analogous to the chemical potential ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the blume - capel model has the same topology as that of figure  [ fig : pdschem ]    monte - carlo simulations of the spin fluid model were performed using a metropolis algorithm within the grand canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "three system sizes corresponding to @xmath182 and @xmath183 were studied , containing ( at liquid - vapour coexistence ) , average particle numbers of @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively . during the course of the simulation runs ,",
    "the joint probability distribution @xmath173 was obtained in the form of a histogram .",
    "the histogram extrapolation technique @xcite was used to explore the coexistence region .",
    "in contrast to the situation for the lj fluid , no independent knowledge of the tricritical scaling functions was available to aid location of the tricritical parameters .",
    "it was thus necessary to employ the cumulant intersection method to determine @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "the fourth order cumulant ratio @xmath189 is a quantity that characterises the form of a distribution and is defined in terms of the fourth and second moments of a given distribution    @xmath190    the tricritical scale invariance of the distributions @xmath191 and @xmath58 , ( as expressed by equation  [ eq : ptri ] ) , implies that at the tricritical point ( and modulo corrections to scaling ) , the cumulant values for all system sizes should be equal .",
    "the tricritical parameters can thus be found by measuring @xmath189 for a number of temperatures and system sizes along the first order line , according to the prescription outlined below . precisely at the tricritical temperature ,",
    "the curves of @xmath189 corresponding to the various system sizes are expected to intersect one another at a single common point .",
    "initially , a very approximate estimate of the location of the tricritical point was inferred from a number of short runs in which a temperature was chosen and the chemical potential tuned while observing the density .",
    "long runs were then carried out using this estimate for each of the three system sizes . from these",
    "runs the first order line and its analytic extension in the @xmath31@xmath114 plane were identified .",
    "the measured values of @xmath192 along this coexistence line are shown in figure  [ fig : fl_ul ] for the each system size .",
    "clearly the curves of figure  [ fig : fl_ul ] have a single well - defined intersection point , from which the tricritical temperature may be estimated as being @xmath193 .",
    "the associated estimate for the chemical potential is @xmath194 .",
    "the tricritical particle and energy densities were estimated to be @xmath195 and @xmath196 respectively .",
    "the average magnetisation is of course strictly zero on symmetry grounds .",
    "typical near - tricritical configurations for the @xmath197 system are shown in figure  [ fig : config ] .",
    "they clearly show the coupling of the density and magnetisation fluctuations , with a disordered spins spin configuration at low density , and an ordered spin configuration at high density .",
    "figure  [ fig : collapse ] shows the forms of the operator distributions @xmath56 , @xmath198 and @xmath58 corresponding to the designated values of the tricritical parameters .",
    "also included in figure  [ fig : collapse ] are the scaled tricritical operator distributions obtained in a separate study of the 2d blume - capel model @xcite . clearly in each instance and for each system size , the scaled operator distributions collapse extremely well onto one another as well as onto those of the tricritical blume - capel model .",
    "this data collapse is perhaps the most stringent test of universality , and transcends critical exponent values , although these too were obtained in the study of reference  @xcite and agree with those of the 2d blume - capel model .",
    "there can thus be little doubt that despite their very different microscopic character , the spin fluid and blume - capel models do indeed share a common fixed point .",
    "the values of the field mixing parameters @xmath38 and @xmath34 , are implicit in the forms of @xmath58 and @xmath198 shown in figure  [ fig : collapse ] , from which one finds @xcite @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "intriguingly , this value of @xmath34 is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that measured at the critical point of the 2d lennard - jones fluid @xcite .",
    "this smallness implies that the scaling field @xmath168 almost coincides with the @xmath31 axis of the phase diagram .    with regard to the forms of the tricritical operator distributions",
    ", it is found that @xmath201 is ( to within the precision of the measurements ) essentially gaussian , implying that the tricritical fluctuations in @xmath21 are extremely weak .",
    "the tricritical form of @xmath202 on the other hand is _ three - peaked _ , in stark contrast to the situation in the 2d ising model , where the critical magnetisation distribution is strongly _",
    "double_-peaked @xcite .",
    "this three - peaked structure reflects the additional coupling between the magnetisation and the density fluctuations .",
    "specifically , the central peak corresponds to fluctuation to small density , which are accompanied by an overall reduction in the magnitude of the magnetisation ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : config ] ) .",
    "were one , however , to depart from the tricritical point along the critical line , these density fluctuations would gradually die out and a crossover to a magnetisation distribution having the double - peaked ising form would occur .",
    "finally in this subsection , we mention that recent theoretical and simulation studies have also been carried out on a 3d spin fluid model having heisenberg instead of ising spins @xcite .",
    "gemc simulations were carried out to determine the liquid - vapour phase envelope , while the behaviour at points on the critical line of magnetic transitions was investigated using a fss analysis in the canonical ensemble .",
    "interestingly the results were not in full accord with the known properties of the lattice heisenberg model , indicating a possible failure of universality .",
    "further work is clearly called for in order to clarify this issue .",
    "simulations of polymer systems are considerable more exacting in computational terms than those of simple liquid or magnetic systems .",
    "the difficulties stem from the problems of dealing with the extended physical structure of polymers , which gives rise to extremely slow diffusion rates , manifest in protracted correlation times . in order to ameliorate these difficulties , coarse - grained lattice - based polymer models such as the bond fluctuation model ( bfm ) @xcite",
    "are often employed . within the framework of the bfm each monomer occupies a whole unit cell of a 3d periodic simple cubic lattice and neighbouring monomers along the polymer chains",
    "are connected via one of @xmath203 possible bond vectors , providing for @xmath120 different bond lengths and @xmath204 different bond angles .",
    "the model sacrifices chemically realistic detail for greater computational tractability , while nevertheless retaining the essential qualitative features of polymeric systems , namely chain connectivity and excluded volume . for studies of critical phenomena ,",
    "this neglect of chemical detail is not expected to bear on the universal scaling properties .",
    "most studies of criticality in polymeric systems have focussed on symmetric blends i.e. two species having identical chains length @xmath205 .",
    "sgce simulations ( cf section  [ sec : ensemble ] ) of simple lattice walks were studied by sariban and binder @xcite who accurately located the critical temperature by using the cumulant intersection method ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : tricrit ] ) .",
    "a similar approach was applied by deutsch and binder @xcite to the bfm , this time making extensive use of histogram reweighting to map the phase diagram as a function of chain length .",
    "they confirmed the ising character of the critical point and reported tentative evidence for a crossover from ising to mean field behaviour away from the critical point @xcite .",
    "work on strongly asymmetric polymer blends @xmath206 , is technically more complicated than for symmetric mixtures , and has only become feasible very recently .",
    "the difficulties stem from excluded volume effects , which prevent one simply removing a chain of one species and replacing it with another of unequal size . for fairly short chains ( @xmath207 )",
    "this problem can be tackled using a novel simulation algorithm due to mller and binder @xcite , which operates by making mc moves that break an a - chain into @xmath208 b - chains or joins @xmath208 b - chains to form a single a - chain .",
    "this algorithm was recently also employed by mller and wilding @xcite to study the critical behaviour of a polymer blend within the bfm , having @xmath209 .",
    "the observables sampled were the concentration of @xmath210 of @xmath211type chains ( the concentration of @xmath97 chains being fixed by stipulating @xmath212 ) and the energy density .",
    "fss methods similar to those described in sections  [ sec : lj ] and  [ sec : tricrit ] were employed to accurately locate the critical point and coexistence curve as a function of the temperature and chemical potential difference between the two species .",
    "the ising character of the critical point was clearly demonstrated and the field mixing parameters obtained .",
    "the scaling of the critical temperature with chain length asymmetry was further studied using fss by mller and binder  @xcite , who found :    @xmath213    in agreement with flory - huggins mean - field theory . for short chains ,",
    "however , the mean field theory was found to overestimate the critical temperature by about @xmath214 due to the failure to treat properly the critical fluctuations .",
    "very recently , mller and schick @xcite have studied a ternary polymer blend comprising two incompatible homopolymers and a symmetric diblock copolymer .",
    "such a system has a phase diagram somewhat similar to that of the spin fluid considered in section  [ sec : tricrit ] , with a line of second order transitions ( corresponding to criticality between the two homopolymer species ) ending in a tricritical point below which there is three - phase coexistence between two homopolymer rich phases and a spatial structured copolymer - rich phase .",
    "the sgce simulation approach was again employed and the ising character of the critical line confirmed using fss methods similar to those described in the section  [ sec : lj ] .",
    "the approximate location of the tricritical point was also determined , although the accessible range of chain lengths and system sizes were not sufficiently large to allow an unambiguous characterisation of its nature .    finally , studies of the polymer - solvent critical point have recently been reported by wilding _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "a biased chain insertion scheme was employed @xcite , allowing a gce algorithm to be implemented for the bfm .",
    "chains up to length @xmath215 monomers were studied and a basic fss study carried out in order to determine the chain length dependence of the critical temperature and volume fraction . for each chain length",
    "investigated , the critical point parameters were determined by matching the ordering operator distribution function to its universal fixed - point ising form .",
    "histogram reweighting methods were employed to increase the efficiency of this procedure .",
    "the results indicate that the scaling of the critical temperature with chain length is relatively well described by flory theory , i.e. @xmath216 , where @xmath48 is the temperature at which the chains behave ideally .",
    "the critical volume fraction , on the other hand , was found to scale like @xmath217 , in clear disagreement with the flory theory prediction @xmath218 , but in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "measurements of the chain length dependence of the end - to - end distance suggested that the chains are not collapsed at the critical point .",
    "in this review we have attempted to show that the finite - size scaling techniques previously deployed with such success for lattice spin models , can also be extended to permit accurate study of critical behaviour in continuum fluids and polymeric systems .",
    "in addition to illustrating how one can tackle the critical region in practice , the applications reviewed were intended to convey a flavour of the types of systems and phenomena that have been studied .",
    "needless to say , however , there are a whole host of other fluid systems which have not yet been studied in detail by simulation , and whose critical phenomena raise a number of very interesting questions . in this section",
    "we attempt to highlight a small selection of them .",
    "one issue that is currently generating great theoretical and experimental interest @xcite , is the thorny question of the nature of criticality in ionic fluids .",
    "although the ising character of simple fluids with short range interactions is well established , the theoretical understanding of ionic criticality is much less developed . owing to their long ranged coulomb interactions ,",
    "ionic fluids are not expected _ a - priori _ to belong to the ising universality class .",
    "however the possibility of an effective short - ranged interaction engendered by charge - screening , does not preclude the possibility of asymptotic ising behaviour .",
    "indeed , experimentally , examples have been found of ionic fluids exhibiting pure classical ( mean - field ) critical behaviour , pure ising behaviour , and in some cases a crossover from mean field behaviour to ising behaviour as the critical point is approached @xcite .",
    "it is thus of considerable interest to determine the asymptotic universal behaviour , as well as the physical factors controlling the size of the reduced crossover temperature .",
    "simulation work on this problem to date has concentrated on the prototype model for an ionic fluid , namely the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) electrolyte , which comprises a fluid of hard spheres , half of which carry a charge @xmath219 and half of which carry a charge @xmath220 .",
    "unfortunately , simulations of this model are hampered by slow equilibration and the need to deal with the long range coulombic interactions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless very recently , a fss simulation study of the rpm has been reported , which applied the techniques of section  [ sec : lj ] , and which appears to show that the critical point is indeed ising like in character @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen though , to what extent this conclusion extends to other less artificial electrolyte models , and whether simulation can shed light on the system - specific factors controlling the disparaties in crossover behaviour observed in real systems .",
    "somewhat similar questions to those concerning ionic fluids , have also recently been raised in the context of simple fluids with variable interparticle interaction range .",
    "gibbs ensemble monte carlo studies of the coexistence curve properties of the square - well fluid @xcite seem to suggest that while for short - ranged potentials the shape of the coexistence curve is well described by an ising critical exponent @xmath221 , the coexistence curve for longer ranged potentials is near - parabolic in shape implying a classical ( mean - field ) exponent @xmath222 .",
    "this finding could doubtless be investigated in greater detail using fss techniques .",
    "if a crossover does indeed occur , it would be useful to try to formulate a ginzburg criterion to describe its location as a function of the interparticle interaction parameters .",
    "experimental and theoretical results concerning crossover from ising to mean field behaviour in insulating fluids and fluid mixtures have also recently been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "another matter of long - standing interest is the question of the physical factors governing the size of the field mixing effect in fluids , which seem to be strongly system specific .",
    "thus , for instance , the measured size of the coexistence curve diameter singularity ( cf .",
    "subsection  [ sec : expt ] ) in molten metals is typically much greater than that seen in insulating fluids .",
    "this has prompted the suggestion @xcite that the size of the field mixing effect is mediated by the magnitude of three - body interactions .",
    "clearly there is scope for simulation to attempt to corroborate this proposal , possibly by introducing many body interactions into a simple fluid model and observing the values of the field mixing parameters as their strength is tuned .    on a slightly different note to those emphasised in this review",
    ", we remark that very little has been done to study interfacial effect close to the critical point of realistic fluid models .",
    "thus there are , to date , no accurate simulation studies of the surface tension critical exponent or associated amplitudes @xcite .",
    "one might conceivably investigate this matter by studying the temperature dependence of the ordering operator distribution @xmath56 at coexistence , using preweighting techniques to overcome the free energy barrier , as has recently been done for the ising model and the lennard - jones fluid @xcite .",
    "turning finally to polymer systems , we note that recent advances in simulation techniques , such as biased growth techniques and chain breaking algorithms contribute significantly to our ability to deal with critical phenomena in polymer systems . nevertheless , the studies reviewed in subsection  [ sec : complex ] were still limited to relatively small chain lengths and system sizes and it is questionable whether the asymptotic ( large chain length ) scaling properties are really being probed .",
    "while growing computational power will help somewhat to alleviate this problem , further algorithmic improvements are clearly called for in order to deal with even longer chains .",
