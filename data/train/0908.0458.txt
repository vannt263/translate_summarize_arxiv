    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ experiment ]",
    "all the experimental methods employed will be described .",

    "finally in section [ discussion ] we discuss the origin of the magnetic - anisotropy for the oriented co , ni ncs system , and the possible formation of co / coo and ni / nio core / shell structures upon annealing at 923 k. this paper is concluded in section [ conclusion ] .",

    "thermal annealing was performed in a high vacuum ( @xmath910@xmath10 mbar ) furnace from 823 k to 1073 k.    the lattice damage induced by implantation was evaluated by rutherford backscattering / channeling spectrometry ( rbs / c ) .",
    "rbs / c spectra were collected with a collimated 1.7 mev he@xmath11 beam at a backscattering angle of 170@xmath12 .",
    "the sample was mounted on a three - axis goniometer with a precision of 0.01@xmath12 . during channeling measurement ,",
    "the sample was aligned to make the zno@xmath90001@xmath13 axis parallel to the impinging he@xmath11 beam .",
    "@xmath14 , the channeling minimum yield in rbs / c , is the ratio of the backscattering yield at channeling condition to that for a random beam incidence @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath14  labels the degree of lattice disorder upon implantation , and an amorphous sample shows a @xmath14  of 100% , while a perfect single crystal corresponds to a @xmath14  of 1 - 2% .",

    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant is very large , and it is difficult to be dominated by other anisotropy energy contribution ( as shown in table [ tab : anisotropy ] ) .",
    "therefore the hcp - co ncs in the as - implanted state still persist the bulk like anisotropy behavior . however , the annealing at 823 k resulted in coexistence of fcc - co and hcp - co ncs .",
    "since fcc - co is a meta - stable state , its magnetic and mechanic data are very limited . therefore in this paper",
    ", we will not discuss its magnetoelastic anisotropy energy .",
    "nevertheless fcc - co[112 ] is the easy axis rather than [ 111 ] , which could be due the lattice strain , as the same reason for ni nanocrystals in zno .",
    "after annealing at 923 k , hcp - co is the only phase , and the elastic strain is not significantly changed compared with the as - implanted state ( see figure [ fig : xrd_conizno_ann](a ) ) .",
    "however , the anisotropy is obviously changed .",
    "like the ni case , there could be another anisotropy source , which will be discussed in section [ 923k ] .",

    "this can well explain the zfc magnetization , but not the fc magnetization .",
    "moreover the drastic changes in coercivity , and magnetic anisotropy can not be explained in such an approach .",
    "in addition , table [ tab : conizno_ann ] lists the comparison of the xrd peak area and the magnetization upon annealing .",
    "note that the xrd peak area decreases drastically by almost one order after 923 k annealing , which indicates the decreasing of the amount of the co or ni ncs , however the saturation magnetization only decreases slightly .",
    "another explanation is due to other anisotropic energy contribution .",
    "_  have found that the exchange coupling between co ncs and their coo shells drastically increase the blocking temperature @xcite . in our xrd measurement ,",
    "the amount of metallic co and ni decreases after annealing at 923 k , which is very probably due to the oxidation .",
    "therefore we could assume the formation of a co / coo core / shell structure in our sample , and the exchange coupling increases the blocking temperature .",
    "the exchange coupling is further confirmed by the vertical shift of the magnetization loop ( figure [ fig : co_mh_zfcfc ] ) .",
    "the loop - curve is shifted along the magnetization axis after cooling from 350 k in an applied field .",
    "the inset shows the temperature dependence of the vertical shift . ]",
    "the vertical shift of the magnetization loop is a strong evidence for the presence of an interfacial interaction between an anitferromagnet ( afm ) and a ferromagnet ( fm ) @xcite , _ i.e. _  the hcp co ncs are surrounded by coo , which is amorphous , and therefore can not be detected by xrd .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a model to discuss the exchange coupling of nanoscaled co / coo core / shell structures . below a critical size ( 12 nm ) of co cores ,",
    "the interfacial exchange energy is larger than both the zeeman energy of fm and the anisotropy energy of the afm due to a large surface - to - volume ratio of ncs , and consequently some spins in the fm part can be frozen by the afm part , leading to a vertical shift along the magnetization axis after field cooling .",
    "this model well explains our co / coo system with an average diameter of 10 nm for co ncs .",
    "the vertical shift of the magnetization loop decreases with increasing temperature and disappears at a temperature between 200 and 300 k. this is consistent with the nel temperature of 290 k for coo @xcite .",
    "such a vertical shift is also observed in the fc - loop measured along zno[10@xmath270]@xmath26hcp - co[10@xmath270 ] ( in - plane ) ( not shown ) .",
    "for the ni implanted sample annealed at 923 k , the hysteresis loop was also measured under both zfc and fc conditions ( not shown ) . a similar shift along the magnetization axis is observed .",
    "therefore we would assume the formation of a co / coo ( ni / nio ) core / shell structure .",
    "the exchange coupling between co ( ni ) and coo ( nio ) contributes another anisotropy energy .",
    "this explains the high blocking temperature and the change in magnetic - anisotropy after annealing at 923 k.    note that for both of cases , the magnetization is only slightly decreased after annealing at 923 k. this is controversial with the drastic decrease of the diffraction intensity ( see figure [ fig : xrd_conizno_ann ] ) .",
    "one possible reason is the formation of small co or ni nanocrystals due to annealing .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : conizno_asimp ] , only around 10 - 40% of co or ni form as metallic nanocrystals and others remain as dispersed ones .",
    "annealing at 923 k , on one hand , oxidized some metallic nanocrystals partially , on the other hand , could induce the gettering of dispersed co and ni and result in small metallic nanocrystals . below a critical size , nanocrystals are non - detectable by xrd .",
    "another reason could be that only a thin shell of co or ni nanocrystals transforms into oxides , which results in the invisibility of oxides in xrd even they are crystalline .",
    "obviously a detailed investigation using transmission electron microscopy or other more sensitive techniques should be performed to clarify this controversy .",
    "a thorough characterization of the structural and magnetic properties has been presented on co and ni implanted zno single crystals .",
    "the results by sr - xrd and squid magnetometery correlate well with each other .",
    "the major conclusions are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) co or ni ncs have been formed in zno upon ion implantation .",
    "their crystalline sizes , generally below 10 nm , increase with increasing fluence . from several to 37% percent of implanted co or ni is in metallic states , while the remaining could be diluted into zno matrix .",
    "the co or ni ncs are the origin of the measured ferromagnetism .",
    "\\(2 ) the co and ni ncs are crystallographically oriented with respect to zno host matrix .",
    "the orientation relationship is as follows : hcp - co(0001)[10@xmath270]@xmath26zno(0001)[10@xmath270 ] , and ni(111)[112]@xmath26zno(0001)[10@xmath270 ] .",
    "this well ordered structure of ncs could result in a rather smooth interface between them and zno host , and makes the hybrid of ferromagnetic ncs and semiconductors promising for spintronics functionality .",
    "\\(3 ) magnetic anisotropy is observed for co or ni ncs in zno . especially for the ni ncs",
    ", the anisotropy is different from the bulk crystals .",
    "the extra anisotropy energy is attributed to the lattice strain impressed from the host matrix .",
    "this opens a route to artificially tune the magnetic properties of nanoparticles by selecting of substrate materials .",
    "\\(4 ) the structure and magnetic properties of co or ni ncs embedded inside zno can be tuned by post - annealing . for the co case , 823 k annealing results in the co - exists of fcc - co and hcp - co .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy is changed from out - of - plane to in - plane .",
    "annealing at 923 k could have partially oxidized metallic co and ni , and result in co / coo ( ni / nio ) core / shell structures .",
    "after annealing at 1073 k , no co or ni ncs can be detectable within the detection limit of sr - xrd , at the same time , the samples shows no pronounced ferromagnetism down to 5 k."
