    "the symmetry in the scale of opposing features is unique to the value @xmath18 , and the angles are determined by @xmath33 , which was chosen arbitrarily for this figure .",

    "careful inspection reveals that while features on opposite sides of the axis have the same overall dimensions , their detailed structure is not identical .",
