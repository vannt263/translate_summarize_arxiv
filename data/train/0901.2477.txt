    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts that the properties of hadronic matter hugely depend on the baryon and isospin density .",
    "for example , it is found that for small baryon chemical potential such that there are no baryons around a bose - einstein condensate of charged pions should arise if the absolute value of the isospin chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) becomes larger than the vacuum pion mass @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this has been shown using the chiral effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "furthermore the existence of a pion condensate was also demonstrated in lattice qcd @xcite , with random matrix theory @xcite , using the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , with the @xmath2 linear sigma model @xcite and with string theory inspired holographic models of qcd @xcite .",
    "the question we would like to address in this article is under which conditions a pion condensate can be realized in a macroscopic system of particles . in order for a macroscopic system to be stable , it should be electrically neutral . since the isospin chemical potential is equal to the charge chemical potential ( @xmath3 ) , requiring neutrality puts restrictions to the value of the isospin chemical potential .    at low baryon chemical potential ( @xmath4 ,",
    "here @xmath5 denotes the mass of the proton ) , the electric neutrality constraint forces @xmath6 so that pion condensation becomes impossible @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . if however a finite density of neutrinos which is in equilibrium with hadronic matter is present , these considerations will be modified . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "ii a nonzero density of neutrinos always increases @xmath7 . if the baryon chemical potential is small and the chemical potential of the neutrinos becomes large enough , it will be energetically favored to convert some of the neutrinos into pions and electrons . in this way as we will show in sec .",
    "ii a pion condensate is formed in a dense neutrino gas for low baryon chemical potential .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the phase diagram of qcd at finite electron and/or muon lepton number chemical potential . in sec .",
    "ii and sec .",
    "iii we will show that pion condensation takes place in a large part of the phase diagram of qcd for @xmath8 . even before the onset of pion condensation , the neutrino gas has interesting implications on the behavior of the pions .",
    "because of the nonzero isospin chemical potential , the degeneracy in the masses of the charged pions will be lifted .",
    "moreover , the lifetime of the pions will change as we will see in sec .",
    "let us point out that similar condensation phenomena can also arise at larger baryon chemical potential ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in dense electrically neutral nuclear matter , @xmath10 can become of the order of the vacuum pion mass .",
    "hence condensation of negatively charged pions in dense nuclear matter seemed a realistic possibility @xcite .",
    "however , due to interactions the in - medium pion mass in nuclear matter is increased such that pion condensation becomes improbable .",
    "on the other hand , the mass of the negatively charged kaon is decreased due to an attractive interaction .",
    "a negatively charged kaon condensate turns out to be a more likely possibility in dense neutral nuclear matter @xcite even at high neutrino densities @xcite . in color superconducting matter which is formed at even higher baryon densities ,",
    "the masses of the kaonic excitations are smaller than those of the pionic excitations @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in electrically neutral color superconducting matter a neutral kaon condensate can be formed , creating the so - called cfl-@xmath11 phase @xcite .    in nature a dense neutrino gas is created during a supernova explosion .",
    "part of the neutrinos produced in this explosion will be trapped in the precursor of a neutron star , the so - called proto - neutron star @xcite . inside a proto - neutron star",
    "the baryon density is very large , which as we stated above makes pion condensation unlikely .",
    "however , one could speculate that in the crust or in the atmosphere the neutrino density might be large and baryon density small enough for pion condensation to occur .",
    "to fully settle this issue one should also show that chemical and thermal equilibrium can be reached . in this paper",
    ", we will not give a definite answer to the question whether or not a pion condensate is realized somewhere in our universe .",
    "we will only unambiguously show that a pion condensate is formed if the conditions are right , that is in a dense neutrino gas at low baryon densities .",
    "at very large neutrino density and small baryon chemical potential it is energetically favored to convert some of the neutrinos into pions and leptons . in this section",
    "we will show that in such a case a pion condensate will be formed .",
    "we will compute at which neutrino density this will happen and discuss the phase diagram as a function of electron and muon lepton number chemical potential .    in order to describe matter at finite density we express the chemical potentials of the up quark ( @xmath12 ) , down quark ( @xmath13 ) , electron ( @xmath14 ) , electron neutrino ( @xmath15 ) , muon ( @xmath16 ) and muon neutrino ( @xmath17 ) in terms of the chemical potentials of conserved quantities .",
    "we will assume that chemical equilibrium is reached , hence @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote respectively the chemical potentials for baryon number , electric charge , electron lepton number and muon lepton number .",
    "strictly speaking , the muon and electron lepton numbers are not separately conserved due to neutrino oscillations .",
    "we will assume that the size of our system is much smaller than the neutrino oscillation length .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the time it takes to bring the system in chemical equilibrium is much shorter than the typical neutrino oscillation time .",
    "in this situation it is to first approximation correct to introduce separate chemical potentials for electron and muon lepton numbers . on long time scales only total lepton number is conserved and one can no longer talk about separate lepton number chemical potentials .",
    "this situation is a special case of our results in which @xmath21 .    to make the system of particles electrically neutral",
    ", the charge chemical potential has to be chosen in such a way that the charge density @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "this can be achieved by solving the following equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the thermodynamic potential .",
    "it has a hadronic and leptonic component",
    ". we will write @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the contribution of the hadrons , @xmath27 that of charged leptons and @xmath28 that of the neutrinos . to a good approximation",

    "one finds that the density of the charged leptons equals @xmath33^{3/2 } , \\label{eq : fermiondensity}\\ ] ] for @xmath34 and @xmath35 otherwise .",
    "the density of the neutrinos is equal to @xmath36    now let us set the temperature to zero and take @xmath37 small so that there are no baryons in the system .",
    "this means that the chemical potential of the proton ( @xmath38 ) should be smaller than the proton mass @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath7 can become @xmath39 , this translates into the requirement that @xmath40 . in that case",
    "it is well known from the analysis using the chiral effective lagrangian that a @xmath41 condensate will form via a second - order transition if @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by lattice qcd simulations @xcite .    if in this particular situation @xmath43 is smaller than @xmath39 , there are no hadronic states around .",
    "hence the hadronic sector is automatically electrically neutral .",
    "the question then is , can we neutralize the leptonic sector such that @xmath44 ?",
    "if so , we have found the onset of pion condensation in electrically neutral matter . answering this question amounts to solving the following equation @xmath45",
    "if there are no neutrinos around this equation has no solution since @xmath44 automatically introduces a nonzero density of electrons and muons .",
    "however , if we for example take @xmath46 we find that @xmath47 guarantees electric neutrality .",
    "pion condensation then sets in at @xmath48 .",
    "this corresponds to a electron and muon neutrino number density of @xmath49 .",
    "now that we found the onset of pion condensation in electrically neutral matter for equal electron and muon lepton number chemical potential , let us see what happens in the more general case in which they are different . by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : onsetpion ] ) for @xmath52 we obtain the phase diagram of qcd as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath20 for @xmath51 and small baryon chemical potential .",

    "[ fig : mulemulmu ] ]    let us discuss the transition line to the @xmath41-condensed phase in somewhat more detail . if @xmath55 there are no muons in the system so it should be neutralized solely by the electrons .",
    "this then gives @xmath56 which corresponds to the vertical lines in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : mulemulmu ] .",
    "hence the length of the vertical line is equal to twice the muon mass . for @xmath57 the exact solution to the neutrality constraint gives the following phase boundary @xmath58 while for @xmath59 we find @xmath60 if the muon lepton number chemical potential vanishes , a @xmath41 condensate will form if @xmath61 this corresponds to an electron neutrino density of @xmath62 .    in some situations like the proto - neutron star it is natural to require zero muon lepton number density ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in such a case we find that the transition to the pion condensed phase occurs at @xmath64 here @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the electron chemical potential is then equal to @xmath66 to a good approximation we can neglect the electron mass in the last equation .",

    "( [ eq : onsetmu ] ) in powers of @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 the solution using the exact expression gives @xmath69 .",
    "hence if the muon lepton number density vanishes pion condensation will occur if the electron neutrino density is larger than @xmath70 .",
    "let us now discuss how the @xmath50 vs.  @xmath20 phase diagram of electrically neutral qcd looks like at finite temperature .",

    "there are points in the phase diagram ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) where the pion condensate does not appear at @xmath51 but arises if the temperature is increased .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , pion condensation arises in electrically neutral hadronic matter for large neutrino densities .",

    "it is of interest to see what happens to the phase diagram at larger baryon chemical potential and higher temperatures .    to investigate the phase diagram at finite @xmath84 and @xmath37 we need to know the hadronic component of the thermodynamic potential , @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately we can not compute @xmath26 in qcd from first principles .",
    "we will resort to an effective model of qcd , the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "the njl model qualitatively describes qcd .",
    "it for example captures the chiral phase transition and can be used to study mesons and pion condensation .",
    "however , it is important to realize that nuclear matter is not described at all with this model .",

    "if the chemical potentials are low enough such that the decay is not blocked in cms , then boosting to finite momentum may bring the backward emitted particles into the fermi sea and thus suppress the decay rate beyond the simple @xmath168-factor from time dilation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the decay is pauli - blocked in cms , boosting to finite momentum may liberate the forward - emitted particles so that the decay becomes possible . in the @xmath54 case parts of the phase space",
    "are blocked by both antimuons and muon neutrinos .",
    "in this article we have shown that a positively charged pion condensate arises in electrically neutral matter at high neutrino and small baryon densities .",
    "we found that at zero temperature , zero baryon chemical potential , and zero muon lepton number density , the onset of pion condensation lies at an electron neutrino number density of @xmath200 .",
    "for zero temperature we have obtained the phase diagram of electrically neutral qcd as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath20 , valid for small baryon chemical potential , @xmath201 .",
    "we have estimated this phase diagram at higher temperatures .",
    "comparison to model calculations with obtained using the njl model show that up to about @xmath145 these estimates are very good .    using the njl model we also studied the behavior of the phase diagram as a function of baryon chemical potential and lepton number chemical potential .",
    "we found that the pion condensed phase arises up to @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the constituent quark mass in the vacuum .",
    "hence the main conclusion of this work is that the pion condensed phase makes up a large part of the phase diagram of electrically neutral qcd at finite lepton number chemical potential and small baryon chemical potential .",
