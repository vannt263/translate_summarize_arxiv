    "these magnetic fields result in chromospheric heating , often observed through the presence and strength of h@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the presence of h@xmath0 emission has been observed to depend on both mass ( or its proxy , spectral type ) and age : early - m dwarfs are active for a much shorter time ( @xmath21  gyr ) than the mid- ( @xmath246  gyr ) and late - m dwarfs ( @xmath37  gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "chromospheric activity strength ( usually quantified by the ratio of the luminosity of h@xmath0 to the bolometric luminosity , @xmath1 ) is also related both to spectral type and age .",

    "the activity trends exhibit significant scatter compared to their dynamic range and measurement errors . since the west et al .",
    "studies were based on an ensemble of single - epoch measurements , the observed spread in activity could originate from the intrinsic variability of the h@xmath0 emission line , or could reflect some intrinsic range in magnetic activity strength .",
    "repeat observations of h@xmath0 emission in m dwarfs often show variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it has only recently been investigated over both long and short timescales .",
    "on timescales of hours to months , @xmath280% of active m dwarfs show significant variability @xcite , usually varying by factors of 1.254 in h@xmath0 ew . in data averaged over 150 day windows , @xcite found variability on 510 year timescales in 10 out of 30 m0m5 dwarfs .",
    "these variability timescales could be linked to stellar rotation , the formation and dissipation of active regions , or long - term variations of the magnetic field .",
    "the relationships between h@xmath0 variability , stellar mass , and age have not been thoroughly investigated .",
    "@xcite , for example , found no net trend in h@xmath0 variability as a function of spectral type , and an increase in variability with declining activity strength .",
    "it is unknown how the broad trends in activity strength with respect to mass and age translate to individual systems , and whether the scatter in the observed trends is due to h@xmath0 variability or is intrinsic to the m dwarf magnetic field strengths . to probe m dwarf activity strength and variability",
    "while controlling for mass and age , we have chosen to monitor a sample of near - equal mass , wide m dwarf binary systems selected from the sloan low - mass wide pairs of kinematically equivalent stars catalog ( slowpokes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with presumably the same age and metallicity and near - equal masses ,",
    "these are nearly identical twins .",
    "in addition , these are wide ( @xmath260015000  au ) binary systems in which both stellar components have evolved independently , without affecting each other s activity ( as observed in tighter systems , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "these binary m dwarfs are a unique test case for the relationships between mass , age , and activity . in section",

    "the slowpokes catalog , constructed from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comprises 1342 wide ( @xmath4500 au ) common proper motion pairs with at least one low - mass ( k5 or later ) component @xcite .",
    "while these systems are classified as binaries based on common proper motion and distance alone , their probability of chance alignment is low . to be part of the slowpokes catalog ,",
    "each pair was required to have a false positive probability ( calculated for each pair using a galactic model including both stellar density and kinematics ) of less than 5% .",
    "@xcite obtained follow - up observations of a 111 of these pairs , finding that 87% showed good agreement in their radial velocities .",
    "the remaining 13% of those pairs were likely to be contaminated with low signal - to - noise observations of spectroscopic binaries ( providing a challenge for the accurate measurement of radial velocities ) . as these common proper motion pairs have a high probability of being physically associated , we assume that they are wide binaries .    with a large number of binaries that extend down to @xmath2m6 spectral types ,",
    "the slowpokes catalog is an ideal source of coeval laboratories to conduct followup studies of m dwarfs .",
    "because the slowpokes binaries were identified from photometry and proper motions without spectroscopic information , the catalog does not include the magnetic activity as measured by h@xmath0 emission for the component stars .",
    "therefore , we selected an initial sample of slowpokes binaries for spectroscopic observations .",
    "the components of the binaries were restricted to m0 and later dwarfs ( @xmath5 ) and to have similar @xmath6 colors ( @xmath7 ) , meaning the components are roughly within one - half spectral type .",
    "we also selected for well - resolved components that fit along the length of the slit ( separations of 7120@xmath8 ) and a minimum brightness of @xmath918 .",
    "this resulted in 176 candidate pairs , 36 of which had been determined to be inactive by @xcite , giving an initial sample of 140 near - equal mass , m dwarf binaries .",
    "while this sample was chosen to be near - equal mass , there exists a small difference in their @xmath6 colors .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the component with the bluer @xmath6 color as the primary ( a ) and the one with the redder @xmath6 color as the secondary ( b ) .    out of the sample of 140 candidate slowpokes binaries , we obtained optical ( @xmath10500010000   ) spectra for 48 pairs ( 96 total stars ) in our sample using the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5-m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) .",

    "flats , biases , and henear comparison arcs were also taken at the beginning or end of every night .",
    "the data were bias subtracted , flat fielded , extracted , and wavelength calibrated ( onto an air scale ) using standard iraf routines .    to identify a sample of h@xmath0-active m dwarf binaries for time - resolved observations , we first determined the spectral types by comparing each spectrum by eye with templates using the hammer software @xcite . in five cases ,",
    "the spectral type of the a component was one subtype later than that of the b component , in contrast with their @xmath6 colors .",

    "variability may instead be a cause of the scatter in activity strength with respect to mass and age .",

    "this variability ranges from a factor of two to an order of magnitude and is comparable to the full range of scatter in the singe - epoch data , indicating that variability could be the main cause for the scatter .",
    "variability does not , however , explain the differences between the a and b components because they persist on timescales of weeks to years . to understand the different h@xmath0 strengths of coeval binaries ,",

    "the active wide binary components did not show the similar levels of h@xmath0 emission that would initially be expected from m dwarfs of the same mass and age .",
    "instead , the a and b components exhibited different levels of emission , with four of the eleven having differences larger than the standard deviation of the scatter in @xmath51 for the @xcite m dwarfs . despite the mean trend of decreasing activity strength with decreasing mass",
    ", we found that seven of the eleven binaries had stronger activity on the less massive ( b ) component .",
    "we also presented 47 hours spectroscopic monitoring for five of the wide binaries .",
    "we examined their h@xmath0 light curves in detail , identifying five flares that all occurred on the b components of the binaries .",
    "the majority of these m dwarfs exhibited significant variability ; the range of activity strength was comparable to the scatter in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath6 color . over the @xmath21 year timescale of the time - resolved observations , the observed binaries continued exhibit stronger activity from their b components , but variations on longer timescales ( e.g. , decades )",
    "may further modify their relative activity strengths .",
    "the variability from our time - resolved data showed no trends with either @xmath6 color or h@xmath0 ew ; we find that variability is independent of both stellar mass and activity strength .",
    "while m dwarf ensemble trends indicate strong relationships between mass , age , and the presence and strength of activity , our observations reveal a complicated relationship between mass , age , and activity for individual stars .",
    "the differences in activity in coeval twins could indicate long timescale solar - type variations in the magnetic field strength or could be due to intrinsic differences in rotation rate and magnetic field generation .",
    "time - resolved observations over longer timescales , in addition to more detailed studies of coeval twins , will be instrumental in a complete understanding of m dwarf activity .",
