    "one of the most important issues for applications of type - ii superconductors is achieving the highest possible critical current .",
    "this requires preventing the depinning and motion of the superconducting vortices that are present in the sample .",
    "a promising approach is the use of artificial pinning arrays , which have been the focus of extensive recent studies . pinning arrays with triangular , square , and rectangular geometries",
    "have been fabricated in superconductors using either microholes or blind holes @xcite or arrays of magnetic dots @xcite .",
    "the resulting critical currents are significantly enhanced at the matching magnetic field @xmath0 where the number of vortices equals the number of pinning sites , as well as at higher fields @xmath1 , with @xmath2 an integer . at the matching fields , peaks or anomalies in the critical current",
    "occur and the vortices form highly ordered commensurate lattices which are free of topological defects @xcite . although it might appear that the best method for increasing the overall critical current would be to increase the pinning density and thus increase @xmath0 , this technique fails since adding too many pins to the sample can degrade the overall superconducting properties by lowering @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , an open question is how the critical current can be maximized using the _ smallest _ possible number of pinning sites . since",
    "completely periodic pinning arrays have been shown to enhance pinning , one can ask whether other pinning arrangements such as quasiordered or semiordered arrays could be even more effective at pinning vortices . in recent simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite , it was demonstrated that a quasicrystalline pinning array produced an enhancement of the critical current compared to a random pinning array for fields below and up to @xmath0 .",
    "the enhancement disappears for fields above @xmath0 , however .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate a new type of commensurability effect that occurs in periodic pinning arrays that have been diluted by randomly removing a fraction of the pinning sites . in an undiluted array ,",
    "the commensurability effects occur at fields @xmath1 . in a diluted array",
    ", @xmath5 is reduced ; however , the pinning array still retains correlations which are associated with the periodicity of the original undiluted pinning array . in this case ,",
    "in addition to commensuration effects at @xmath0 , we observe noticeable commensuration effects at the higher field @xmath6 , the matching field for the _ undiluted _ pinning array , even though many of the pins that would have been present in such an array are missing . strong peaks in the critical current associated with well - ordered vortex configurations appear at @xmath7 .",
    "this commensurability effect is remarkably robust and still appears in arrays which have up to 90% of the pinning sites removed , so that @xmath8",
    ". in samples with equal numbers of pinning sites , diluted periodic pinning arrays produce considerable enhancement of the critical current for fields well above @xmath0 compared to random pinning arrays .",
    "the diluted periodic pinning arrays also have a reduced amount of one - dimensional vortex channeling above @xmath0 compared to undiluted periodic pinning arrays .",
    "such easy vortex channeling is what leads to the reduction of the critical current above @xmath0 in the undiluted arrays .",
    "our results should also apply to related systems such as colloids interacting with periodic substrates @xcite and vortices in bose - einstein condensates interacting with optical traps @xcite .",
    "we simulate a two - dimensional system of size @xmath9 with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions containing @xmath12 vortices and @xmath13 pinning sites .",

    "forces are measured in units of @xmath30 and distances in units of @xmath24 .",
    "the vortex density @xmath31 .",
    "the vortex - vortex interaction force falls off sufficiently rapidly that a cutoff at @xmath32 is imposed for computational efficiency and a short range cutoff at @xmath33 is also imposed to avoid a force divergence .",
    "the @xmath34 pinning sites are modeled as attractive parabolic potential traps of radius @xmath35 and strength @xmath36 , with @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the location of pinning site @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the pinning density is @xmath43 .",
    "the pins are placed in a triangular array with matching field @xmath44 that has had a fraction @xmath45 of the pins removed , so that @xmath46 .",
    "the lorentz driving force @xmath47 , assumed uniform on all vortices , is generated by and perpendicular to an externally applied current @xmath48 .",
    "the initial vortex positions are obtained by simulated annealing from a high temperature .",
    "after annealing , the temperature is set to zero and the external drive @xmath49 is applied in increments of @xmath50 every @xmath51 simulation time steps .",
    "we measure the average vortex velocity in the direction of the drive , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the velocity of vortex @xmath14 , and define the critical depinning force @xmath54 as the value of @xmath49 at which @xmath55 . we have found that for slower sweep rates of the driving force , there is no change in the measured depinning force .",

    "interstitial vortices experience an effective pinning force due to the interactions with the surrounding vortices . since the interstitial vortices are more weakly pinned than vortices in pinning sites , the critical depinning force is lower than it would be for an undiluted array at @xmath110 , where every vortex sits in a pinning site . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the initial motion of the vortices at depinning in an undiluted array occurs via channeling of the interstitial vortices between the pinning sites along an effective modulated one - dimensional potential created by the vortices located at the pinning sites @xcite . in a diluted periodic pinning array at @xmath111 ,",

    "the @xmath133 versus @xmath23 curve has a very similar trend to the @xmath61 case , with a peak in @xmath138 at the crossover between plastic and elastic depinning followed by a decrease in the depinning force for @xmath140 ; however , @xmath138 drops off more quickly for the undiluted pinning array at @xmath139 than for the diluted pinning array with @xmath61 .",
    "the vortex lattice is always triangular for the @xmath61 diluted pinning array at @xmath121 , so as @xmath119 increases there is no change in the vortex lattice structure and every pinning site remains occupied .",
    "for the undiluted pinning array at @xmath139 the vortex lattice experiences an increasing amount of distortion for @xmath137 as the structure changes from a honeycomb arrangement in which all of the pinning sites are occupied to a triangular arrangement in which some pins are empty .",
    "this implies that for stiff vortex lattices , a relatively larger depinning force can be obtained from a diluted pinning array than from an undiluted pinning array with an equal number of pinning sites .",

    "we note that a peak in @xmath138 still appears for vortex densities that are well away from commensuration due to the competition between the pinning energy and elastic vortex lattice energy .",
    "one aspect we did not explore in this work is the effect of melting and thermal fluctuations on the diluted pinning arrays .",
    "melting would be relevant in strongly layered superconductors with periodic arrays of columnar defects .",
    "if a diluted periodic pinning array could be fabricated in a layered superconductor , it is likely that a rich variety of thermally induced effects would appear .",
    "one system that should have similar behavior is a sample with a low density of randomly placed columnar defects in which the number of vortices is much greater than the number of pinning sites @xcite .",
    "theoretical work suggests that such a system can undergo a bragg - bose glass transition @xcite . in the case where the pinning is periodic , it would be interesting to determine whether the melting transition shifts upward or downward at @xmath94 compared to away from @xmath94 .",
    "additionally , at intermediate dilution it may be possible to observe two - stage melting or a nanoliquid .",
    "such a nanoliquid has been observed in experiments with patterned regions of columnar defects @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that commensuration effects can occur in superconductors with diluted periodic pinning arrays . pronounced peaks in the critical depinning current occur at magnetic fields corresponding to the matching field for the undiluted array , @xmath100 , which may be significantly higher than the matching field @xmath0 for the pinning sites that are actually present in the sample .",
    "the commensurability effect is associated with the formation of ordered vortex lattice arrangements containing no topological defects .",
    "this effect arises since the diluted pinning array has correlations in reciprocal space at the same values of @xmath39 as the undiluted pinning array , enabling a matching effect to occur for the diluted array when the vortex density matches the density of the undiluted array .",
    "the effect is remarkably robust , and peaks in the critical depinning force persist in pinning arrays that have been diluted up to 90% . for small dilutions",
    ", a peak can also appear at the true matching field @xmath0 . in samples with equal numbers of pinning sites , diluted periodic arrays have smaller critical depinning currents than undiluted arrays at fields below @xmath0 , but produce a significant enhancement of the critical current at fields above @xmath0 compared to both undiluted arrays and random pinning arrangements .",
    "this enhancement for @xmath143 is due to the suppression of easy channels of one - dimensional motion that occur in the undiluted arrays .",
    "we have also examined the effect of the vortex lattice stiffness on depinning . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the depinning is plastic in soft lattices and the interstitial vortices begin to move before the pinned vortices , while for stiff lattices the depinning is elastic and the entire lattice depins as a unit . in the plastic depinning regime which appears at small lattice stiffness , the depinning force increases with increasing lattice stiffness",

    "the depinning force decreases with increasing lattice stiffness .",
    "a peak in the depinning force occurs at the crossover between plastic and elastic depinning . for stiffer lattices",
    "the diluted pinning arrays show more pronounced matching effects .",

    "<S> using numerical simulations , we demonstrate that superconductors containing periodic pinning arrays which have been diluted through random removal of a fraction of the pins have pronounced commensurability effects at the same magnetic field strength as undiluted pinning arrays . </S>",
    "<S> the commensuration can occur at fields significantly higher than the matching field , produces much greater critical current enhancement than a random pinning arrangement due to suppression of vortex channeling , and persists for arrays with up to 90% dilution . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that diluted periodic pinning arrays may be a promising geometry to increase the critical current in superconductors over a wide magnetic field range . </S>"
