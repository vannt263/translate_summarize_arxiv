    "different scenarios can be distinguished by line fluxes and profiles , the structure of the progenitors can be probed , and the time of the explosion can be determined .",
    "@xmath0-rays can provide a good determination of the @xmath2 production for nearby sne  ia because , nowadays , accurate distances of nearby galaxies can be obtained by @xmath3ceph .",
    "moreover , all sky surveys by @xmath0-rays may provide an unbiased rate of sne  ia . as we will discuss below",
    ", advances in the fields of optical and ir observations and of the theory have helped to redefine the goals of sn research by @xmath0-rays .",

    "we assume homologous expansion of density and chemical structures calculated by spherical and 3-d hydro simulations .",

    "overall , @xmath1 spectra and their evolution is characterized by a turnover from a phase dominated by @xmath2 to @xmath7 lines ( fig .",
    "the time of the explosion can be determined by the ratio between the @xmath2(0.81mev ) and the @xmath7(0.84 mev ) lines because it varies strongly with time of the explosion but it hardly depends on the model . with time",
    ", the envelope becomes increasingly transparent .",
    "the spectral evolution depends sensitively on the density and chemical structure of the envelope and , thus , provides a valuable tool for the discrimination of explosion models .",
    "for example , sub - chandrasekhar mass models show as a distinguishing feature an outer layer of @xmath2 which reveals itself by high @xmath1-ray fluxes and broads already a few days after the explosion ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . at late phases ( @xmath8100 days ) ,",
    "the absolute line fluxes and profiles provide a direct measure of the total @xmath2 mass and its distribution . for @xmath9 models ,",
    "the high densities close to the center ( @xmath10 ) result in the production of neutron - rich iron - group isotopes rather than @xmath2 .",
    "the size of this central region increases with @xmath11 .",
    "a knowledge of this property is critical to detect because systematic variations in @xmath11 can produce an offset ( up to @xmath12 , @xcite ) in the brightness decline relation @xcite , a cornerstone of modern cosmology with sne  ia ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "optical and near ir - spectra do not allow to distinguish isotopes .",
    "however , the lack of central @xmath2 reveals itself in by flat - topped line profiles ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . to detect the variation , we need resolutions between 20 to 30 which are well within reach for the upcoming integral mission .",
    "we want to mention one problem related to the analysis of observed line fluxes during the first months after the explosion .",
    "an advantage of @xmath0-ray compared to optical analyses is that the results are insensitive to details of the physics or numerical treatment .",
    "e.g. the specific opacities do not depend on temperature or density .",
    "this advantage is somewhat lost along the way when comparing the observations with theoretical predictions .",
    "problems are caused by the time- and model - dependent line shifts and widths ( @xmath13 ) , the intrinsic response function of the instrument which is non - gaussian , and they are connected to the actual definition used to determine integrated line fluxes from synthetic spectra .",
    "the actual value may differ by up to a factor of 2 even if based on a given synthetic spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "back then , sne  ia were discovered a few days before maximum or later and , in general , light curves were rather uncertain and the spectral coverage was poor . even for nearby sne  ia , distances to the host galaxy were uncertain by 20 to 30 % .",
    "now , accurate @xmath3-ceph .",

    "detailed observations of optical and infrared spectra and light curves allowed sophisticated analyses and test of scenarios , ruling all but out the once popular helium triggered detonations , and strongly favoring deflagration or delayed detonation @xmath9 models or , in some instances , the merger scenario ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observation of polarization in sne  ia has shown that , in general , these objects are fairly spherical @xcite with the noticeable exception of very subluminous sne  ia @xcite . for the first time , a direct connection with the progenitors seems to be within reach . in particular , there is mounting evidence for a connection between the properties of the progenitor , and the physics of the explosion @xcite . the recent progress may redefine the role of modern @xmath0-ray astronomy for the field of supernovae , and some of classical goals may have been rendered less compelling .",
    "@xmath0-rays are particular valuable to measure the 3-d structure of sne  ia .",
    "a comprehensive list of new goals is beyond the format of this paper .",
    "we want to address two of the areas , namely , @xmath0-rays as tools to reveal properties of nuclear burning front and large scale asymmetries .    _",
    "nuclear burning fronts : _ within @xmath9 models , optical and ir lcs and spectra can be reproduced by models in which a ( slow ) deflagration front turns into a detonation ( e.g. @xcite ) or , alternatively , a deflagration front is rapidly accelerating as in w7 @xcite . however , successful models require parameterized descriptions for the propagation of the burning front . for a discussion , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the propagation of a detonation front is well understood but the description of the deflagration and the deflagration to detonation transition ( ddt ) pose problems . on a microscopic scale , a deflagration propagates due to heat conduction by electrons .",
    "though the laminar flame speed in sne  ia is well known , the front has been found to be rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) unstable , increasing the effective speed of burning @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the physics of flames .",
    "starting from static wds , hydrodynamic calculations of the deflagration fronts have been performed in 2-d @xcite , and full 3-d @xcite .",
    "these calculations demonstrated the complicated morphology of the front .",
    "@xcite finds that , while the expansion of the envelope becomes almost spherical , the inhomogeneous chemical structure will fill about 50 to 70% of the star ( in mass ) .",
    "the resulting chemical inhomogeneities and their scale depends sensitively on the structure of the initial wd , i.e. progenitor and the pre - conditioning of the runaway . if a ddt occurs at densities needed to reproduce normal - bright sne  ia , most of the unburned fuel will be consumed during the detonation phase and , by enlarge , the chemical inhomogeneities will be eliminated .",
    "however , they will survive in pure deflagration models .",
    "currently , state of the art 3-d calculations are restricted to the regime of linear instabilities , i.e. the flamelet regime .",
    "the consistent treatment is restricted to the early part of the deflagration phase . in these calculations ,",
    "the initial acceleration of the the deflagration front is followed by a declining rate of burning .",
    "this leave a significant fraction of the wd unburned ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the resulting structures can not account for the observations of typical sne  ia @xcite .",
    "this problem is well known from spherical deflagration models with a low deflagration speed ( e.g. df1 , @xcite ) , and it triggered the suggestion of a ddt , or , alternatively , showed the need for continuously accelerating deflagration front @xcite . despite the limitations of current models",
    ", the chemical clumps will not mix in the subsequent phase . to test for possible effects of chemical inhomogeneities produced during the deflagration",
    ", we have remapped a 3-d chemical structure on a spherical explosion model ( fig .",
    "the resulting line profiles show fluctuations of about 10 % .",
    "their frequency provides a measure of the scale of the instabilities which depends on the c / o ratio of the progenitor .",
    "weak or absent fluctuations in the @xmath0-ray spectra would be a strong indicator for a ddt .",
    "_ large scale asymmetries : _ one of the open questions is the nature of subluminous sne  ia such as sn  1991bg @xcite . among them , sn  1999by is one of the best observed sne  ia .",
    "in addition to the studies of optical light curves , detailed polarization spectra of the subluminous sn  1999by have been obtained and analyzed @xcite . whereas ` normal '",
    "sne  ia tend to show little or no polarization @xcite , this supernova was significantly polarized , up to 0.7% , indicating an overall asphericity of the photosphere of @xmath19 .",
    "this result suggests that there may be a connection between the observed asphericity and the subluminosity in sne  ia . among others ,",
    "a possible explanations are the explosion of a rapidly rotating wd and its effect on the propagation of nuclear flames during the explosive phase of burning , or extensive burning of carbon just prior to the runaway @xcite .",
    "polarization in the optical measures the asymmetry of the photosphere but , in general , provides little information whether it is caused by a global asymmetry in the density structure or in the excitation mechanism , i.e. the @xmath2 distribution . to test the sensitivity of @xmath0-rays ,",
    "we have calculated the transport for the subluminous model of ellipsoidal shape ( figs .",
    "the flux and line profiles vary as a function of inclination ( e.g. by @xmath20 at day 23 ) . in combination with optical and ir observations",
    ", @xmath0-rays can be a key to answer the question on the nature of the asymmetry .",
