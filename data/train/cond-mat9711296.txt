    "cellular automata ( ca ) do not only serve as simple model systems for the investigation of problems in statistical mechanics , but they also have numerous applications for real problems @xcite . therefore it is not suprising that in recent years ca have become quite popular for the simulation of traffic flow ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .    here",
    "we do not want to discuss the question whether ca are suitable models for the description of traffic .",
    "we try to provide a tool box for the determination of the basic properties of the stationary state using analytical methods .",
    "these methods can also be applied to other ca models .",
    "ca are  by design ",
    "ideal for large - scale computer simulations . on the other hand , analytical approaches for the description of ca",
    "are notoriously difficult .",
    "this is mainly due to the discreteness and the use of a parallel updating scheme ( which introduces non - locality into the dynamics ) .",
    "in addition , these models are defined through dynamical rules ( e.g.  transition probabilities ) and usually one does not have a hamiltonian description . therefore standard methods are not applicable .",
    "furthermore , one has to deal with systems far from equilibrium which do not satisfy the detailed balance condition .",
    "however , there is a need for exact solutions or , at least , for good approximations .",
    "these results as well as other exact statements may help to greatly reduce the need for computer resources .",
    "the interpretation of simulation data is often difficult because of the numerical noise. even in the cases where an exact solution is not possible , a combination of analytical and numerical methods might provide better insights .    here",
    "we will present analytical approaches which allow to solve the special case @xmath0 of the nagel - schreckenberg model @xcite exactly .",
    "for @xmath1 these methods are only approximations , but they become exact in certain limits . we will discuss the quality of these approximations and how relevant information about the underlying physics can be obtained .",
    "the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model @xcite is a probabilistic cellular automaton .",
    "space and time are discrete and hence also the velocities .",
    "the road is divided into cells of length 7.5 m. each cell can either be empty or occupied by just one car .",
    "the state of car @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is characterised by an internal parameter @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , the momentary velocity of the vehicle . in order to obtain the state of the system at time @xmath6 from the state at time @xmath7 ,",
    "one has to apply the following four rules to all cars at the same time ( parallel dynamics ) :    r1 : :    acceleration :   @xmath8   ( only if    @xmath9 ) + r2 : :    braking :   @xmath10  ( for    @xmath11 ) + r3 : :    randomization :   @xmath12  with probability @xmath13 ( if    @xmath14 ) + r4 : :    driving :   car @xmath2 moves @xmath15 cells .",
    "here @xmath16 denotes the number of empty cells in front of car @xmath2 , i.e.   the gap or headway .",
    "one timestep @xmath17 corresponds to approximately 1 sec in real time @xcite",
    ".    for simplicity we will only consider periodic boundary conditions so that the number of cars is conserved .",
    "the maximum velocity @xmath18 can be interpreted as a speed limit and is therefore taken to be identically for all cars .",
    "the four steps have simple interpretations .",
    "step r1 means that every driver wants to drive as fast as possible or allowed .",
    "step r2 avoids crashes between the vehicles .",
    "the randomization step r3 takes into account several effects , e.g.  road conditions ( e.g.  slope , weather ) or psychological effects ( e.g.  velocity fluctuations in free traffic ) .",
    "an important consequence of this step is the introduction of an asymmetry between acceleration and deceleration , e.g.  overreactions at braking which are important for the occurance of phantom traffic jams .",
    "finally , step r4 is the actual motion of the vehicles .",
    "the nasch model is a minimal model in the sense that all four steps r1-r4 are necessary to reproduce the basic properties of real traffic . for more complex situations ( e.g. 2-lane traffic ) additional rules",
    "have to be formulated .    in the following sections several methods for an analytical description of the nasch model will be presented .",
    "the simplest analytical approach to the nasch model is a ( microscopic ) mean - field ( mf ) theory .",
    "here one considers the density @xmath19 of cars with velocity @xmath20 at site @xmath2 and time @xmath7 . in the mf approach ,",
    "correlations between sites are completely neglected .",
    "for @xmath0 the mf equations for the stationary state ( @xmath21 ) read @xcite : @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the flow is simply given by @xmath25 .",
    "for random - sequential dynamics the mf approach is known to be exact for @xmath0 @xcite . for parallel dynamics",
    ", however , mf theory underestimates the flow considerably ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_vmax1 ] ) .",
    "this shows that correlations are important in this case .",
    "these correlations lead to an increase of the flow .",
    "therefore one expects a particle - hole attraction ( particle - particle repulsion ) , i.e.  the probability to find an empty site in front of a car is enhanced compared to a completely random configuration .",
    "this picture will be confirmed by the exact solution .",
    "the mf equations for arbitrary @xmath26 are given in @xcite .",
    "one finds the same qualitative behaviour , i.e.  mf theory underestimates the flow even more than for @xmath0 .",
    "an important effect of the parallel dynamics is the existence of configurations which can not be reached dynamically @xcite .",
    "these states are called garden of eden ( goe ) states or paradisical states since they have no predecessor . an example for a goe state",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_goeconf ] .",
    "note that the velocity is equal to the number of cells that the car moved in the previous timestep .",
    "for the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_goeconf ] this implies that the two cars must have occupied the same cell before the last timestep depicts a goe state or not ! ] .",
    "since this is forbidden in the nasch model , the configuration shown can never be generated by the dynamics .",
    "the simple mean - field theory presented in the previous section does not take into account the existence of goe states .",
    "one can therefore hope that by eliminating all goe states and applying mean - field theory in the reduced configuration space ( paradisical mean - field , pmf ) one will find a considerable improvement of the mf results .    for @xmath0",
    "all states containing the local configurations @xmath27 or @xmath28 are goe states , i.e.  the cell behind a car with velocity 1 must be empty .",
    "this only affects eq .",
    "( [ mf1 ] ) and the equations for pmf theory read : @xmath29 where the normalization @xmath30 ensures @xmath31 and is given explicitly by @xmath32 .    solving ( [ pmf11 ] ) for @xmath33 by using @xmath34 , one obtains @xmath33 as a function of the density @xmath35 . since the flow is given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( with @xmath24 ) , we recover the exact solution for the case @xmath0 found first in @xcite using the cluster approximation ( see section [ sec_clust ] ) . note that the flow depends on the density only via @xmath38 , reflecting the particle - hole symmetry of the nasch model for @xmath0",
    ".    for @xmath39 one has to take into account more goe states @xcite .",
    "pmf is no longer exact , but it still leads to a considerable improvement of the mf results ( see fig .  [ fig_goe ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for random - sequential dynamics mf theory is exact whereas for parallel dynamics pmf is exact .",
    "this suggests that the important difference between random - sequential and parallel dynamics is the existence of garden of eden states in the latter .",
    "this is probably not only true for the nasch model , but rather is a general property of ca models .",
    "the cluster approximation is a systematic improvement of mf theory which takes into account short - ranged correlations between the cells . in the @xmath40-cluster approximation a cluster of @xmath40 neighbouring cells",
    "is treated exactly . the cluster",
    "is then coupled to the rest of the system in a self - consistent way .",
    "related approximations have already been used ( under different names ) for other models @xcite .    in order to simplify the description , we choose a slightly different update - ordering r2-r3-r4-r1 instead of r1-r2-r3-r4 , i.e.  we look at the system after the acceleration step",
    ". then there are no cars with @xmath41 and effectively we have to deal with one equation less . in the following we will use occupation variables @xmath42",
    "where @xmath43 , if cell @xmath2 is empty , and @xmath44 , if cell @xmath2 is occupied by a car with velocity @xmath20 .",
    "if we denote the probability to find the system in a configuration @xmath45 by @xmath46 the 1-cluster approximation means a simple factorization @xmath47 this is nothing but the mean - field theory of section [ sec_mf ] . for the 2-cluster approximation one",

    ".    however , for @xmath51 already the 2-cluster approximation is exact @xcite .",
    "this is understandable from the results of the previous section since in this case the 2-cluster approximation is able to take into account all goe states .",

    "using @xmath53 , one obtains the exact result for the flow ( see ( [ v1flow ] ) ) . note that the particle - hole attraction is apparent from these results , since @xmath54 .    for @xmath55 the fundamental diagrams obtained from the @xmath40-cluster approximation ( @xmath56 )",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig_fund2 ] with results of monte carlo simulations .",
    "one can see a rapid convergence , already for @xmath57 the difference between the simulation and the cluster result is extremely small .      as an application of the cluster approximation",
    "we will compute density - density correlations for @xmath58 in the following . using occupation numbers",
    "@xmath59 the density - density correlation function is defined by @xmath60 where the prime indicates that the sum runs over all states with fixed particle number @xmath61 .    in order to evaluate the sum in ( [ corrdef ] ) , it is convenient to use a grand - canonical description .",
    "one introduces a fugazity @xmath62 which controls the average number of particles @xmath63 and sums over all configurations in ( [ corrdef ] ) . using the 2-cluster approximation ( [ 2clusterapp ] )  which is exact for @xmath0  the correlation function is given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 and the normalization @xmath66 introducing the transfer matrix @xmath67",
    "this can be written succinctly as @xmath68 with the matrix @xmath69 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath70 can be obtained from the asymptotic behaviour ( @xmath71 ) of the correlation function @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the ( average ) density of cars .",
    "@xmath70 is determined by the ratio of the eigenvalues @xmath74 of @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 the explicit expression for @xmath70 is rather lenghty .",
    "therefore we just note that , for fixed @xmath13 , @xmath70 is maximal for @xmath77 .",

    "finds that @xmath80 .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the same behaviour still occurs ( at density @xmath81 ) for @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the correlation function already gives an indication that the system is not critical for @xmath83 .",
    "the simulations show that there is no qualitative difference between the cases @xmath0 and @xmath82 as far as the phase transition is concerned @xcite .",
    "the above results demonstrate that , although the 2-cluster approximation is exact , not all correlation functions are short - ranged or even of finite range .",
    "we briefly mention other results which have been obtained analytically using the cluster approximation . in @xcite",
    "the distributions of gaps and the distance between jams have been calculated for @xmath0 using the 2-cluster approximation .",
    "for the gap distribution one recovers the ( exact ) result which will be derived in sect .",
    "[ seccomf ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ gapdist ] ) ) . for the calculation of the distribution of gaps between jams one defines every vehicle with velocity 0 to be jammed .",
    "the distance between two jams is then given by the distance between a car with velocity 0 and the next car with velocity 0 .",
    "in @xcite the probability @xmath84 of a time headway @xmath7 has been investigated .",
    "this quantity is defined in analogy to measurements on real traffic where a detector registers the time interval between the passing of consecutive cars .",
    "the car - oriented mean - field ( comf ) theory @xcite is another possibility to take into account correlations in an analytical description .    the central quantitiy in comf is the probability @xmath85 to find exactly @xmath40 empty cells ( i.e.  a gap of size @xmath40 ) in front of a car with velocity @xmath20 . in this way",
    "certain longer - ranged correlations are already taken into account .",
    "the essence of comf is now to neglect correlations between the gaps .    for @xmath0 the system of equations resulting from the master equation has the following form : @xmath86,\\nonumber\\\\ p_1(t+1)&= & g(t)p_0(t ) + \\left[qg(t)+p\\bar g(t)\\right]p_1(t )             + q\\bar g(t)p_2(t),\\\\ p_n(t+1)&= & pg(t)p_{n-1}(t ) + \\left[qg(t)+p\\bar g(t)\\right]p_n(t )           + q\\bar g(t)p_{n+1}(t),\\quad ( n\\geq 2)\\nonumber \\label{comfv1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 $ ] ( @xmath88 ) is the probability that a car moves ( does not move ) in the next timestep .",
    "as an example for the derivation of these equations we consider the equations for @xmath89 . since the velocity difference of two cars is at most 1 , a gap of @xmath40 cells at time @xmath6 must have evolved form a gap of length @xmath90 , @xmath40 , or @xmath91 in the previous timestep .",
    "a headway of @xmath90 cells evolves into a headway of @xmath40 cells only if the first car moves ( with probability @xmath92 ) and the second car brakes in the randomization step ( probability @xmath13 ) , i.e.  the total probability for this process is @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , the headway remains constant only if either both cars move ( probability @xmath94 ) or both cars do not move ( probability @xmath95 ) .",
    "finally , the headway is reduced by one , if only the second car moves ( probability @xmath96 ) .    although this infinite system of non - linear equations looks more difficult than those of the cluster approximation , a solution possible using generating functions @xcite . for @xmath0",
    "one finds @xmath97,\\nonumber\\\\ p_n & = & \\frac{p_0}{p}\\left(\\frac{p(1-p_0)}{p_0+p(1-p_0)}\\right)^n \\quad ( n\\geq 1 ) , \\label{gapdist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the flow @xmath98 again the exact solution is reproduced .    for @xmath55 one",
    "has two coupled systems of the type ( [ comfv1 ] ) , since one has to distinguish @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "this system can also be solved , but as for the other methods , one does not find an exact solution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_comf ] results for the distribution of headways are shown . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the distribution has just one maximum at @xmath101 , with @xmath102 for small @xmath35 and @xmath103 for large @xmath35 . for higher velocities",
    ", however , there is a density regime where the headway distribution exhibits two local maxima @xcite .",
    "the maximum at @xmath103 corresponds to jammed cars and the second maximum corresponds to free flowing cars .",
    "in this section the results of the cluster approximation and comf in special limits are compared .",
    "as already mentioned , both methods yield the exact solution for @xmath0 .",
    "this is related to the fact that paradisical mean - field is exact in that case and both methods are able to identify all goe states .",
    "for @xmath55 the situation is different . here",
    "all three methods are only approximative .",
    "the quality of comf is usually between those of the 2-cluster and 3-cluster approximations .    in the limit @xmath79 , comf and",
    "the 3-cluster approximation become exact , in contrast to the 2-cluster approximation ( see fig .  [ fig_smallp ] ) . even for values of @xmath104",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the fundumental diagrams obtained analytically and the monte carlo simulations .",
    "since realistic values of @xmath13 are in the region @xmath105 the approximations are indeed applicable in the relevant parameter regime .",
    "the limit @xmath106 is difficult to investigate numerically .",
    "preliminary results show that comf not exact in this limit .",
    "the cluster approximations give a much better agreement with monte carlo simulations , but it is not clear yet whether it becomes exact or not .    in order to understand the differences between comf and the cluster approximation",
    "we calculate the distribution of jam sizes using these methods .",
    "let @xmath107 be the probability to find a ( compact ) jam of length @xmath40 , i.e.  @xmath40 consecutive occupied cells .",
    "@xmath108 is proportional to @xmath109 in 2-cluster approximation . here",
    "we have again used the different update - ordering r2-r3-r4-r1 .",
    "@xmath110 denotes the conditional probability @xmath111 .",
    "note that the case @xmath112 has to be treated separately , @xmath113 .",
    "the number of jams is given by @xmath114 and one obtains @xmath115 @xmath116 decays exponentially for @xmath89 , especially one has @xmath117 . for",
    "the @xmath118-cluster approximation one can derive similar expressions .",
    "now one finds an exponential decay for jam sizes @xmath119 , i.e.   small clusters may dominate ( e.g.  @xmath120 is possible ) .    in comf",
    ", @xmath108 is proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "the number of jams is propotional to @xmath122 so that one finds @xmath123 this distribution is purely exponential and @xmath124 for all @xmath40 .",
    "therefore comf is not able to describe clustering or phase separation , i.e.  situations where jams with more than one car dominate .",
    "clustering implies that there are correlations between gaps which are completely neglected in comf .",
    "since for @xmath79 comf is exact , there is no tendency towards clustering in this limit . on the hand , for @xmath106 comf fails to give a good description of the phyisics since there is a strong tendency towards clustering or phase separation in that limit .",
    "note that for the ( deterministic ! ) case @xmath125 the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath26 becomes most pronounced , since only for @xmath26 metastable states exist @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss briefly two other models which have been investigated with the methods presented before .",
    "both models are modified nasch models .",
    "the first one is the @xmath126 model @xcite .",
    "it is a nasch model with a modified acceleration rule .",
    "this so - called slow - to - start rule is designed to mimic the delay of a car in restarting , i.e.  due to a slow pick - up of the engine or loss of the driver s attention .",
    "we will discuss only the case @xmath0 . here",
    "the slow - to - start rule has the important effect of breaking the particle - hole symmetry of the nasch model .",
    "explicitly the slow - to - start rule is given by :    r1 : :    acceleration with slow - to - start : a standing car will always    accelerate to @xmath127 if there are at least two empty sites    in front ; +    is there only one empty site , it will accelerate only with probability    @xmath128 .",
    "9 shows the results for the fundamental diagram @xcite . since the particle - hole symmetry is broken , the flow is now maximal at a density @xmath129 .",
    "another interesting effect can be seen for larger values of @xmath130 : the flow vs.  density relation has an inflection point and is no longer convex , i.e.  the parameter @xmath130 controls the curvature of the fundamental diagram ( fig .",
    "this can be seen most clearly for @xmath131 . here",
    "the flow @xmath132 vanishes for @xmath133 .",
    "this new phase transition to a completely jammed state exist only for @xmath83 .",
    "[ fig_t2 ]    for @xmath77 the stationary state consists of standing cars with exactly one empty site in between them ( @xmath134 where @xmath135 denotes a standing car and . an empty site ) .",
    "no car can move due to the slow - to - start rule . for larger densities",
    "the stationary state is essentially of the same form , but larger clusters of standing cars will appear . in monte carlo simulations starting from a mega - jam the relaxation into this stationary state",
    "is extremely slow , even for large values of @xmath13 , e.g.  @xmath136 .",
    "the comf equations have two solutions @xcite .",
    "apart from the solution with vanishing flow for @xmath137 there exists a second solution with @xmath138 for @xmath139 ( dotted line in fig .",
    ". therefore one might expect the existence of a hysteresis effect in this model , which is indeed found in monte carlo simulations .",
    "this is not surprising since the slow - to - start rule reduces the outflow from a megajam compared to the maximum flow of free traffic which seems to be an important factor for the occurance of hysteresis .",
    "the second model has been introduced by fukui and ishibashi @xcite and can be considered as a nasch model for `` aggressive driving '' .",
    "again the rules are identical to the nasch model , only the acceleration rule is changed :    r1  : :    acceleration : every car accelerates to @xmath18 .    for @xmath0",
    "this does not change anything , but for higher velocities it leads to a considerable enhancement of the flow .",
    "although the model is less realistic than the nasch model , it is of interest due to its simplicity .",
    "an analytical description is much simpler than that of the nasch model since after the acceleration step all cars have the same velocity @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the analytical description is much simpler and might serve as testing ground for new methods @xcite .",
    "[ fig_raser ]",
    "although cellular automata are designed for efficient computer simulation studies , an analytical description is possible , although difficult .",
    "we have present here four different methods which can be applied to ca models of traffic flow .",
    "the first approach , a simple mean - field theory for cell occupation numbers , is insufficient since the important correlations between neighbouring cells ( e.g.  the particle - hole attraction ) are neglected .",
    "we therefore suggested three different improved mean - field theories .",
    "these approaches take into account certain correlations between the cells .",
    "the simplest method is the so - called paradisical mean - field theory which is based on the observation that certain configurations ( garden of eden states ) can never be generated by the dynamical rules due to the use of parallel dynamics .",
    "the cluster approximation , on the other hand , treats clusters of a certain size exactly and couples them in a self - consistent way .",
    "therefore short - ranged correlations are taken into account properly .",
    "in contrast , car - oriented mean - field theory is a true mean - field theory , but here one uses a different dynamical variable , namely the distance between consecutive cars . in that way ,",
    "certain correlations between cells are taken into account .",
    "all three improved mf theories become exact for @xmath0 . for larger values of @xmath18",
    "they are just approximations . in principle , the cluster approximation and comf ( in combination with a cluster approach ) can be improved systematically .",
    "this is , however , very cumbersome .",
    "an interesting observation is that the qualitity of the approximation depends strongly on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "this indicates that the physics changes with @xmath13 , contrary to common believe .",
    "evidence for this scenario comes from the behaviour of the jam distribution and the phase transition .",
    "the methods presented here can also be used for other ca models .",
    "the investigation of the nasch model has led to a better understanding of their advantages and limitations so that it is easier to choose the approach most suitable for a given problem .",
    "the question , how the stationary state is approached , is still an important open issue .",
