    "butcher & oemler ( 1978a ; 1984 , hereafter bo84 ) found that the fraction of blue galaxies increases dramatically between redshifts @xmath1 = 0 and @xmath7 0.5 , now usually referred to as the butcher  oemler effect ( hereafter bo effect ) .",
    "this trend has been confirmed by e.g. rakos & schombert , ellingson et al . ,",
    "kodama & bower and margoniner et al . .",
    "the increase of blue galaxies is explained by a higher rate of star formation in cluster galaxies at earlier epochs .",
    "the cause of this higher star formation rate is , however , not fully understood .",
    "butcher & oemler ( 1978a ) noted that the excess of blue galaxies at higher redshifts compared to todays clusters approximately matches the excess of s0 galaxies in local clusters .",
    "if such a change in the morphological mix is caused by an evolution of the blue galaxies into s0 galaxies , once the gas in the star forming blue galaxies is exhausted or tidally stripped , this could lead to the observed bo effect .",
    "the evolution of the fraction of s0 s between high and low redshift clusters is discussed in e.g. dressler et al . and fasano et al . .",
    "bower and kauffmann explain the bo effect as a natural consequence of the hierarchical clustering model for structure evolution in the universe . in this picture structures , such as clusters , are built up from bottom up , via repeated mergers of subunits .",
    "bower shows that the infall rate of field galaxies to clusters increases with look - back time , leading to a higher fraction of blue galaxies in the clusters .",
    "the trend found is not as strong as in the bo84 observations , but can be fitted if the blue fraction in the field increases with redshift .",
    "kauffmann shows that high redshift clusters assemble during a much shorter time interval than comparable clusters today .",
    "this in turn implies a higher rate of infall of galaxies from the field at higher redshift , producing the bo trend .",
    "however , the strong increase in the blue fraction of the observed clusters is explained only in high - density ( @xmath8 ) cdm models , or mdm models .",
    "low - density cdm models have difficulty in explaining the strong trend at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "recent simulations by diaferio et al .",
    "find that a bo trend is found also in a low - density model ( @xmath10 ) , but significantly weaker than in observations .",
    "it is not clear if star formation is triggered in the infalling galaxies , possibly creating a burst , or if star formation in the field galaxies is simply quenched over some period of time .",
    "both these scenarios seem compatible with the observed bo effect .",
    "the results from bo84 also show that open clusters have a larger fraction of blue galaxies than the more centrally concentrated , compact clusters .",
    "( a formal definition of open and compact clusters is given in section 4.1 . )",
    "this can be explained in the context of the hierarchical scenario , if the smaller concentration in open clusters is a reflection of a more recent assembly of its members .",
    "the presence of substructure in a cluster can be a sign of recent subcluster - subcluster merger . from a study of three clusters with signs of substructure at @xmath11 , metevier ,",
    "romer & ulmer find that at least two of these have an exceptionally large fraction of blue galaxies .",
    "this supports a hierarchical scenario where mergers induce star formation in the cluster galaxies .",
    "furthermore , results from margoniner et al . indicate that poor clusters in general have higher blue fractions than rich clusters at comparable redshifts .",
    "it is therefore clear that the bo effect is not a simple redshift effect , but must be viewed as a consequence of several factors .",
    "these include richness , central concentration , epoch of formation and presence of substructure .",
    "a further prediction of the hierarchical cdm model is that the number density of galaxies should be dominated by low mass systems .",
    "this is reflected in the luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) , defined as the number density of galaxies per unit luminosity , or per unit magnitude .",
    "for the hierarchical scenario , the lf is predicted to have a steep faint - end slope , reflecting the increasing number of low mass systems with faint magnitudes @xcite .",
    "therefore , studies of the lf , both in the field and in clusters , is one of the most direct probes for testing the hierarchical model .",
    "detailed studies of the spatial and morphological distribution of cluster galaxies are important for understanding the internal properties of clusters , as well as the evolution of these over time .",
    "to do this observationally , it is necessary to isolate the galaxies in a given field belonging to the cluster , from the foreground or background field galaxies , projected on to the cluster .",
    "spectroscopy is costly , since a cluster field may consist of thousands of galaxies .",
    "more important , for clusters at higher redshifts spectroscopy is limited to only the most luminous galaxies .",
    "the traditional way of correcting for field contamination at faint magnitudes is to use a cluster - free field , preferentially close to the cluster , and calculate the number of galaxies as a function of magnitude to be subtracted from the cluster image .",
    "this method is , however , increasingly uncertain at higher redshifts , where the ratio of field galaxies to cluster galaxies increases ( e.g. driver at al .",
    "1998a ) . in section 3.7",
    "we show that the field contamination can exceed 80 per cent of the total number of galaxies for clusters at redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "a further important disadvantage is that it is not possible to assign membership to a specific galaxy with any confidence .",
    "an alternative and more powerful way to determine cluster membership is to use photometric redshifts based on broad band photometry to estimate redshifts .",
    "the main advantage with this method is that a large number of redshifts can be determined in a relatively short time , and to magnitudes considerably fainter than traditional spectroscopy .",
    "an important bonus is that the photometric redshift technique also provides an estimate of the hubble type for the observed galaxies , or more precisely , their broad spectroscopic characteristics .",
    "this information can be used , together with redshift information , to determine the fraction , as well as the spatial distribution , of different types of galaxies .",
    "we later discuss this technique in more detail .    the trade - off with this method",
    "is that uncertainties in the estimated redshifts are considerably larger compared to spectroscopy .",
    "the accuracy has , however , improved and typical rms deviations between spectroscopic redshifts and broad band photometric redshifts are @xmath13 0.05 at @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 0.060.1 up to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this accuracy is sufficient for determination of cluster membership and absolute magnitudes , but is clearly not useful for dynamic studies .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the use of photometric redshifts for a population study of the cluster cl1601 + 42 . with information on cluster membership and spectroscopic galaxy type",
    ", we calculate the luminosity function separately for early - type and late - type galaxies within the cluster , as well as their spatial distribution .",
    "previously , photometric redshifts have been used to determine cluster membership for a few clusters only .",
    "the most extensive study of photometric redshifts applied to clusters of galaxies is presented by brunner & lubin .",
    "they in paricular , discuss how the method can be used to either maximize completeness , or to minimize contamination from field galaxies .",
    "lubin & brunner present results on the distribution of galaxy morphologies in two distant clusters , where cluster membership is determined by photometric redshifts .",
    "kodama , bell & bower use photometric redshifts for determining cluster members in abell 370 at @xmath17 .",
    "connolly et al .",
    "include photometric redshifts when investigating a supercluster structure at @xmath1 = 0.54 , and connolly , szalay & brunner use the method for measuring the evolution of the angular correlation function in the hdf .",
    "finally , bzecourt et al . use photometric redshifts when analysing weak lensing of the cluster abell 2219 at @xmath1 = 0.22 .",
    "for studies of the lf and population content of clusters this method has , however , only had limited use .",
    "the cluster cl1601 + 42 is an intermediate rich cluster at @xmath1 = 0.54 .",
    "it was chosen because there already exist both high resolution hst imaging of the core of the cluster @xcite , and a fairly large number of spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies in the cluster field @xcite .",
    "the cluster is included in the morphs sample of ten clusters at @xmath18 ( smail et al .",

    "[ figure4 ] and figure [ figure6 ] clearly illustrates the gain with the photometric method , especially at faint magnitudes .",
    "the larger error - bars in figure [ figure4 ] around @xmath57 21 are due to the smaller statistics in these bins for the photometric method , probably caused by the use of different background fields in the two methods .",
    "the result also indicates that the subtraction method works reasonably well to redshifts @xmath58 , even though the number of cluster galaxies vary somewhat between the methods .",

    "their conclusions are , however , valid for a specific observational set - up .",
    "we reach a completeness limit @xmath60 mag fainter than the limit used by driver et al . , which should increase the reliability of the subtraction method to a higher redshift .",
    "a possible source of uncertainty in the background subtraction method comes from gravitational lensing .",
    "background galaxies in the cluster image can have their magnitudes amplified by the cluster , leading to an excess of background galaxies in the cluster image , compared to the cluster free image used for subtraction .",
    "for the rich cluster a963 , which show signs of arcs , driver et al .",
    "estimate that the increase in background counts is @xmath61 10 per cent .",
    "when investigating the coma cluster , bernstein et al .",
    "argue that this increase will be cancelled by the reduction of the solid angle being viewed behind the lensing cluster , making no correction necessary . considering this , together with the fact this cl1601 +",
    "42 is both intermediate in richness and concentration and has no detected arcs , we find that gravitational lensing should not affect our results .",
    "effects from gravitational lensing should not enter into the photometric method , since we do not subtract galaxies behind the cluster , but instead reject them using the redshift information .",
    "another factor to account for in the subtraction method is crowding , i.e. overlapping object .",
    "especially faint objects , with small areas , can be hidden behind brighter galaxies and stars .",
    "since there are in total more objects in the cluster image than in the background image , this can lead to a higher fractional loss of faint galaxies in the cluster image , resulting in a lf with too few faint objects . using similar arguments as in nslund et al .",
    ", we estimate the loss by adding the total area covered by objects in the cluster image and the background image , respectively .",
    "we find that the correction in the number of faint galaxies in the cluster lf is less than two per cent .",
    "since this correction factor is much less than statistical errors , as well as field - to - field variations , we do not include any corrections due to crowding in our results .    for the photometric method ,",
    "only foreground galaxies contribute to the crowding .",
    "the effect should be of equal importance in the cluster field and the field used for subtraction , and therefore cancel .      using the cluster galaxies selected by photometric redshifts , we plot the radial distribution of the cluster members with @xmath40 @xmath62 25 in fig . [ figure7 ] .",
    "the left panel shows the projected surface density , and the right panel shows the fraction of late - type and early - type galaxies as a function of radius .",
    "the most interesting result is that the cluster outside of @xmath63 mpc shows a roughly constant fraction of late - type galaxies , @xmath61 70 per cent of the total . inside this radius",
    "the fraction of early - type galaxies increases rapidly to @xmath61 80 per cent at the centre .",
    "although , this effect is present also in low redshift clusters ( e.g. whitmore , gilmore & jones 1993 ) , our result shows that this population gradient is set up already at @xmath64 0.54 .",
    "in fact , the gradient is even steeper than in local clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] we plot the radial distribution for bright ( @xmath65 ) and faint ( @xmath66 ) galaxies separately .",
    "while the bright galaxies show a steep cluster - centric distribution , the faint galaxies have a slower increase , which flattens at the centre , consistent with a homogeneous distribution of faint galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the figure also shows the radial distribution separately for bright and faint late - type galaxies .",
    "we discuss the radial distribution further in section 5.2 .",
    "bo84 showed that the fraction of blue galaxies , @xmath6 , in cores of rich compact clusters increases dramatically from @xmath67 for clusters with @xmath68 , to @xmath69 at @xmath4 .",
    "to determine @xmath6 in cl1601 + 42 we adopt the definition in bo84 .",

    "we find @xmath75 arcmin , or @xmath76 mpc for the cosmology above .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the typical radius of @xmath77 mpc given by kodama & bower for a sample of rich clusters at @xmath78 , but similar to the radius @xmath79 mpc used by van dokkum et al . for the cluster ms1054 - 03 at @xmath80 .",
    "our value of @xmath71 is also similar in angular size , @xmath81 arcmin , to that used by bo84 for their highest redshift clusters .",
    "the blue fraction we find is @xmath82 .",
    "this value for cl1601 + 42 is significantly higher than the local value @xmath83 , but lower that the average value @xmath84 at @xmath29 , taken from the fit presented by bo84 .",
    "note , however , that bo84 did not use k  corrections that depend on the spectral type of the galaxies @xcite . including this , @xmath6 decreases by @xmath85 , and the k - corrected average bo value at @xmath86",
    "would therefore be @xmath87 . even after this correction",
    ", we find that a significant difference between the blue fraction in cl1601 + 42 and the bo84 sample remains .",
    "finally , a possible concern here are systematic effects , which can discriminate against selecting blue late - type galaxies , and therefore lead to an underestimate of @xmath6 . from the mc simulations described in section 3.3 , as well as comparing with available spectroscopic redshifts",
    ", we find that systematic effect can cause a relatively higher loss of blue galaxies when selecting cluster galaxies by using a fixed redshift interval .",
    "this may lead to an underestimate of the blue fraction by @xmath88 .",
    "the small effect here is due to the relatively bright limiting magnitude used to select the bo - galaxies , i.e. @xmath89 ( corresponding to @xmath90 ) . here",
    "systematic effects are not expected to affect the photometric redshifts more than marginally .",
    "however , when we in section 5.3 determine the blue fraction to fainter magnitudes , the underestimate may reach @xmath91 .",
    "cl1601 + 42 was observed with wfpc2 on hst during cycle 4 with the f702w filter .",
    "the total exposure was 16800 s @xcite .",
    "the image covers the central 5 square arcmin of the cluster , and detailed morphological information are presented by smail et al .",
    "for all 145 objects with @xmath92 .",
    "five of these are classified as stars , whereas no classification was possible for a further six objects .",
    "of the five objects classified as stars we get the same identification for three , while the other two are found in the lowest redshift bin , consistent with these also being stars .",
    "of the six objects without hst classification we identify three as stars , one as possible star and two as galaxies .",
    "this leaves 134 galaxies with classified morphology .",
    "we are able to determine photometric redshifts for 129 of these objects .    of the 68 galaxies classified as early - type galaxies by the photometric redshift method , @xmath93 per cent have morphologies classified as e to sa , and the rest are sab to irr .",
    "conversely , of the 61 galaxies photometrically classified as late - type galaxies , @xmath94 per cent are morphologically classified as sab to irr . even though there may be some uncertainty in the visual classification into hubble types ( smail et al . set @xmath95 as the limit where no more than 20 per cent of the galaxies differ by more than one hubble type between two different classifiers ) ,",
    "the main reason for this relatively low correspondence is the lack of a direct relation between spectroscopic and morphological types , as also shown by e.g. , dressler et al . and poggianti et al . .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] , which shows the rest frame @xmath72 colour for the galaxies within the redshift range of the cluster , divided into two broad morphological classes .",
    "the lower panel shows the colours of the galaxies with early hubble types ( e  sa ) , and the upper panel later types , as determined from the hst data by smail et al .",
    "most early - type galaxies are red and have a small dispersion in colour .",
    "there is , however , a tail of galaxies with relatively blue colours .",
    "the distribution of later types have a broader distribution , but are on average @xmath96 mag bluer than the earlier types .",

    "2000 ) reveals that both nearby and distant clusters show a steep faint - end slope ( @xmath103 ) , indicating no qualitative difference with redshift .",
    "our results for cl1601 + 42 show that this conclusion is true up to @xmath4 .    for the highest redshift cluster with a deep lf , ms2255.7 + 2039 at @xmath102 , nslund et al .",
    "derive @xmath104 ( in our cosmology ) and @xmath105 , when fitting their data to a single schechter function .",
    "this agrees well with our results in table [ table2 ] .    the increased fraction of faint galaxies in the outer part of cl1601 + 42 , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] , has the consequence that the faint - end slope of the lf should depend on radius .",
    "consequently , we find that the faint - end slope for galaxies within a radius of 80 arcmin ( 0.7 mpc ) is @xmath106 , while between 80160 arcmin ( 0.71.4 mpc ) @xmath107 . when comparing the lf s between clusters , it is therefore important to remember that the slope of the lf in the core region can be much shallower than for the cluster as a whole .",
    "a steepening of the slope with radius is consistent with studies of local clusters .",
    "adami et al .",
    "e.g. , find a faint - end slope @xmath108 for the core region of coma , while for the whole cluster trentham finds a considerably steeper faint - end slope , @xmath109 .",
    "also , five of seven clusters at @xmath110 examined by driver , couch & phillipps show this trend .",
    "the faint - end slopes for these seven clusters vary between -0.9 and -1.4 , which is more shallow than the slopes for the clusters quoted in the beginning of this section . the flatter slope compared to cl1601",
    "+ 42 may be understood as a result of the effect above , since the clusters in the sample of driver et al .",
    "only cover a radius half the linear size of our cluster .",
    "it is interesting to compare the rest frame @xmath38band lfs of cl1601 + 42 and the coma cluster ( trentham 1998 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] .",
    "coma is here normalised to cl1601 + 42 at @xmath111 .",
    "note that we use similar methods as trentham to correct the magnitudes at faint levels ( see section 2.5 ) .",
    "also , both investigations use a 3@xmath50 detection and similar surface brightness limits .",
    "we have for cl1601 + 42 added two data points derived from the one colour subtraction method ( open circles ) .",
    "these points are in agreement with a continuation of the steep slope found at intermediate magnitudes .",
    "the figure shows that at intermediate magnitudes , @xmath112 , coma has a gaussian lf peaking at @xmath113 , before the faint galaxies start to dominate at @xmath114 , and the slope of the lf turns steep .",
    "however , for cl1601 + 42 the steep part sets in already at @xmath111 , and no plateau is present , as in coma .",
    "if the apparent lack of a plateau in cl1601 + 42 is a general property at this redshift , it could indicate a general brightening of the faintest cluster members , because of more active star formation , with increasing redshift .",
    "this brightening would shift the faint , steep end towards brighter magnitudes at higher redshift , and therefore decrease the extent of the plateau-range , while preserving the slope .",
    "this is consistent with coma having @xmath115 at @xmath116 , and cl1601 + 42 @xmath117 at @xmath118 .",
    "the plateau between the turnoff at bright magnitudes , and the up - turn at faint , is present in both ms2255 at @xmath102 and a963 at @xmath101 .",
    "this indicates that the star formation activity of the faint galaxies indicated by cl1601 + 42 at @xmath29 , is not as important in the two clusters at lower redshift .",
    "there is some controversy regarding the colour dependence of the faint - end slope of the lf . de propris et al .",
    "determine the lf for four abell clusters in both @xmath38 and @xmath41 . although the slopes are very steep ( @xmath119 ) , there is no difference between the two colours .",
    "these results are in contrast to the results of wilson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who determine the lf in @xmath38 and @xmath41 for a665 and a1689 , both at @xmath120 , and find @xmath121 for the @xmath39band and @xmath122 for the @xmath41band .",
    "comparing the slope of the lf s of the different colours for cl1601 + 42 ( table [ table2 ] ) , there is no significant trend when going from red to blue filters .",
    "this is consistent with the dominance of the late - type population at faint magnitudes .",
    "if a majority of the galaxies have similar colours , i.e. k - corrections , then one expects a horizontal shift of the faint - end lf between the different bands , while the steepness remains unchanged .    to investigate",

    "while the optical bands do not show any trend in the faint - end slope , the steepening of the slope in the @xmath130-bands suggests that the faintest cluster galaxies have an increasing fraction of young , @xmath130 bright stars .    in a recent paper valotto ,",

    "the over - density in the background , along the cluster line - of - sight , will result in an over - abundance of faint galaxies , which remains after the subtraction of a cluster - free background field .",

    "find that the selection process therefore can introduce an artificial steepening of the lf .    by selecting cluster members with photometric redshifts",
    ", the background contamination should be minimized in our sample . the steep faint - end slope that we find should therefore not be much affected by the selection effects described by valotto et al .",
    "furthermore , the similar slope we derive from the background subtraction method indicates that projection effects are not important for cl1601 + 42 .      from deep studies of both near and intermediate redshift clusters ,",
    "it is clear that a single schechter function gives a rather poor representation of the lf ( e.g. driver et al .",
    "1994 ; wilson et al . 1997",
    "; nslund et al .",
    "for the virgo cluster binggeli et al . find that ellipticals with @xmath131 , as well as the different types of spiral galaxies , are better represented by gaussian lfs .",
    "the mean magnitude is for the spirals shifted towards fainter magnitudes for the later types .",
    "the sum of all types of spirals can also be well represented by a gaussian lf . at magnitudes m@xmath132 dwarf ellipticals ( de ) and irregulars",
    "the up - turn of the lf at the faintest magnitudes is mostly due to the de population , where a schechter function is a better representation of the lf .",
    "the total lf should therefore rise as a gaussian at bright magnitudes and then flatten to a plateau at intermediate magnitudes , before it again turns steep at the faint end .",
    "the conclusions above may seem to contradict other studies showing a flat lf .",
    "garilli , maccagni & andreon find @xmath133 for a composite lf calculated from 65 clusters at @xmath134 , while paolillo et al .",
    "find @xmath135 for 39 clusters at @xmath136 , when fitting their data to a single schechter function .",
    "paolillo et al .",
    "do , however , point out that the lf below m@xmath137 in these clusters , which probes the dwarf population , is systematically above the schechter function fit , indicating a upturn of the faint - end slope at these magnitudes .",
    "the flat slopes found in these investigations are therefore not in conflict with the steeper slopes found in deeper studies .",
    "above we argued that the lack of a plateau in the lf of cl1601 + 42 , as compared to clusters at lower redshift , can be explained by a uniform shift in magnitude for the fainter galaxies . because these galaxies are predominantly blue ( fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) , the proposed shift can be interpreted as a result of a higher star formation level in this population of galaxies compared to the bright population . for cluster galaxies at @xmath1 = 0.24 , which have had their star formation truncated , smail et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that late types galaxies both fade more and become redder than early type galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the shift of the late type population in cl1601 + 42 .",
    "the total reddinging and fading between @xmath1 = 0.24 and @xmath1 = 0 is , however , fairly modest in these models .",
    "a more substantial fading is expected if dynamical processes are involved .",
    "wilson et al . argue that dwarf irregulars in clusters should fade rapidly , either due to a trunction process , such as ram pressure stripping , or by disruption due to tidal interactions .",
    "they estimate the fading since @xmath138 to @xmath139 mag .",
    "such a fading would make part of the progenitors of todays dwarfs with @xmath140 -15 detectable in cl1601 + 42 , and could therefore contribute to the faint - end slope .",
    "further , simulations of galaxy harassment @xcite show that high redshift ( @xmath141 ) cluster galaxies of type sc or later can be turned into low surface brightness spheroidal systems in todays local clusters .",
    "the fading of these harassed galaxies should be @xmath142 mag .",
    "the dwarf ellipticals present at @xmath4 should , on the other hand , only fade marginally by @xmath143 0.5 mag .",
    "whatever the mechanism , it seems that at least a fraction of the galaxies contributing to the steep slope at the faint end in local clusters have faded considerably compared to earlier epochs .",
    "the gradual disappearance of the plateau at high redshift could therefore be explained as a fading of the faint , late - type population , relative to the bright population .",
    "this scenario requires that the number of recently accreted galaxies is higher at @xmath4 than today , i.e. that there is an increase in the infall rate with redshift . as shown by the press",
    "schechter formalism , n - body simulations , as well as observations , this is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "a bluening with redshift , i.e. an increased star formation rate , of the infalling field population can also contribute to the observed effect .",
    "diaferio et al .",
    "show that there is a significant increase in star formation rate in field galaxies over the redshift range @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the brightening is likely to be due to a combination of the above two effects .",
    "the brightening of the blue cluster population also relates to the bo effect , which shows an increase of star formation in a large fraction of cluster galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "we return to this in section 5.3 .",
    "we now focus on the evolution of the bright cluster population .",
    "smail et al .",
    "calculate composite lfs for ten clusters in the morphs sample divided into three redshift bins centred on @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath29 .",
    "( the last bin includes cl1601 + 42 . )",
    "the galaxies are here divided into ellipticals and spirals ( sa and later ) , based on visual classification into morphological types .",
    "the limiting magnitude for this sample is , however , too bright to detect the dwarf population , or for determining the faint - end slope . instead , when calculating the turnoff magnitude , smail et al .",
    "fix the faint - end slope at @xmath147 for the ellipticals , and at @xmath148 for the spirals .",
    "they find that there is a slow brightening of the elliptical population from @xmath149 to @xmath29 by @xmath150 .",
    "the spiral population does , however , not show any clear evolution with redshift .",
    "a change of cosmology affects these results somewhat . adopting @xmath151 and @xmath152 , instead of @xmath153 as in smail et al .",
    ", increases the brightening of the ellipticals to @xmath154 .",
    "there will in this case also be a marginal brightening for the spiral galaxies .",
    "a somewhat larger evolutionary trend is found by kodama & bower , who estimate that the bright spiral population have faded by about one magnitude since @xmath141 .",
    "the fading of the bright population is therefore smaller than of the faint population , which is in turn consistent with the disappearance of the plateau .",
    "as we have just discussed , galaxies are in a hierarchical scenario accreted from the field on to the clusters ( e.g. , diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ) . when field galaxies , which are predominately spirals with ongoing star formation , are accreted , star formation is halted after a possible burst of star formation .",
    "the quenching can either be abrupt , or there could be a more gradual decline in star formation ( e.g. barger et al .",
    "1996 , poggianti et al .",
    "1999 , balogh et al .",
    "1999 , balogh , navarro & morris 2000 , diaferio et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the decrease in star formation should set up a radial gradient in the clusters , where blue galaxies are expected to be more numerous in the outer parts , as is confirmed by observations and simulations ( diaferio et al .",
    "also , the higher accretion rate at earlier epochs , as well as higher star formation rate in the general field , implies that the fraction of blue galaxies should be higher in high@xmath1 clusters .",
    "there is therefore a connection between the shape of the lf and the existence of a radial colour gradient .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] we showed the radial distribution of late - type galaxies , divided into a bright subsample , with @xmath65 , and a faint subsample with @xmath66 . from the figure it is obvious that bright , blue galaxies are rare across the whole cluster . the flat , or at most slightly increasing , projected surface density is consistent with a decline in the spatial distribution towards the core , even though the small statistics do not make this significant .    the faint blue galaxies show a more dramatic trend . at radii",
    "@xmath155 mpc this is the most numerous population in the cluster . here , the surface density is consistent with a volume density that is either uniform , or decreasing with radius .",
    "the drop in surface density at the innermost point is consistent with an absense of faint blue galaxies at the core of the cluster .",
    "an explanantion may be provided by galaxy harassment , which should be increasingly efficient in the denser core region .",
    "the increasing infall rate at high redshifts , predicted by hierachical clustering , should result also in a change with redshift of the radial gradient of the fraction of early - type galaxies in the cluster .",
    "ellingson et al .",
    "show that galaxies with an old population dominate to larger radii in low redshift ( @xmath156 ) clusters , giving a flatter radial gradient , compared to high redshift ( @xmath157 ) clusters .",
    "this indicates that high@xmath1 clusters have a higher population of recently accreted , star forming galaxies at radii closer to the core , causing a steeper radial gradient .",
    "as the number of recently accreted star forming galaxies declines with time , the gradient becomes less steep .    with similar magnitude limits and the same cosmology as in ellingson et al .",
    ", we find that the radial gradient of cl1601 + 42 is at least as steep as the slope they find from their high redshift sample , and significantly steeper than that of the low redshift clusters .      to check whether the blue fraction , @xmath6 , decreases towards the core as a result of a decreasing star formation rate in the accreted field galaxies as they fall deeper into the cluster potential , we plot in fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] @xmath6 as function of radius ( here given in terms of r@xmath158 mpc ) . from this figure",
    "it is clear that there is a trend for an increasing value of @xmath6 at larger radii .",
    "this is in agreement with both bo84 and kodama & bower , and consistent with the infall scenario .",
    "as is discussed by kodama & bower , the change of @xmath6 with radius further illustrates the necessity of a correct determination of @xmath71 for a meaningful comparison of the blue fraction between clusters .",
    "it is also interesting to calculate the blue fraction as a function of the magnitude cut , as is done in kodama & bower for their seven clusters at @xmath159 . when varying the magnitude cut by @xmath160 mag from the fiducial value m@xmath161 they find that @xmath6 remains almost constant . only for two of the most distant clusters",
    "is there a trend for @xmath6 to increase at fainter magnitudes , which kodama & bower , however , attribute to increasing photometric errors with magnitude . instead , they argue that @xmath6 should depend only weakly with magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] we plot @xmath6 as a function of the magnitude cut .",
    "we find a clear trend for an increasing value of @xmath6 as fainter galaxies are included , similar to the trend for two of the highest redshift clusters in kodama & bower , but contradicting the general claim by kodama & bower that the blue fraction should be constant with magnitude . as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , the increasing value of @xmath6 at faint magnitudes in cl1601 + 42 is a direct consequence of the different shapes of the red and blue lfs .",
    "the steepness of the blue lf causes the blue fraction to increase at fainter magnitude cuts , and decrease at bright .    because we are more than one magnitude brighter that our limit , the increase in photometric errors is @xmath162 mag over the magnitude range where we calculate @xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the strong trend of @xmath6 with magnitude in cl1601 + 42 can be explained by increasing photometric errors at fainter magnitudes , as proposed by kodama & bower for the clusters showing this trend in their investigation .",
    "note also that systematic effects when selecting the bo - galaxies may lead to an underestimate of the blue fraction in the faintest bin by @xmath91 , as discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "this means that the trend shown in figure [ figure12 ] could be even stronger .",
    "the dependence on the magnitude cut makes the calculated blue fraction dependent on the choice of cosmology .",
    "e.g. , a constant cut in absolute magnitude , in the bo84 case @xmath70 , corresponds to a fainter apparent magnitude in a @xmath163dominated cosmology than in a cosmology without cosmological constant .",
    "this should lead to a relatively higher blue fraction at increasing redshifts for the @xmath163 cosmology . using @xmath151 and @xmath152 , instead of the cosmology used by bo84",
    "( @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) changes the cut in apparent magnitude by @xmath166 at @xmath29 .",
    "this increases the blue fraction from @xmath167 to @xmath168 .",
    "the difference between the extrapolated @xmath6 at @xmath29 from bo84 , and the @xmath6 found for cl1601 + 42 should therefore decrease in a @xmath163cosmology .",
    "we finally notice that the blue fraction for the field , derived from the eis data , is @xmath169 at the cluster redshift ( @xmath170 ) , and @xmath171 at lower redshift ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "this is close to the blue fraction @xmath173 calculated for the field by bo84 .",
    "the similarity between the blue fraction in the low and intermediate redshift bins does not reflect the strong increase with redshift in the star formation in field galaxies found by diaferio et al . .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , even though the relatively large errors in @xmath6 do not rule out such trend .",
    "the fraction of late - type galaxies for the field is @xmath63 .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the rough distribution of field galaxy types used by smail et al . .",
    "colours of galaxies do not only reflect star formation , but are also dependent on metallicity , reflected in the cm relation ( e.g. faber 1977 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) . in principle , a low metallicity could cause faint old , but blue , galaxies in our sample to be classified as star forming late - type galaxies . to estimate the importance of this effect for the blue population at @xmath174 , we calculate the cm relation for the bright population with @xmath175 , and extrapolate this to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the slope of the @xmath72 vs. @xmath39 cm relation we find for the early - type galaxies in cl1601 + 42 is @xmath176 , for @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) . over the full interval @xmath179",
    "the mean bluening is then @xmath180 .",
    "this is small compared to the mean off - set in colours between early - types and late - types , which is @xmath181 at @xmath182 .",
    "in addition , if part of the bluest old galaxies at faint magnitudes ( @xmath183 ) are identified as late , star forming galaxies due to a low metallicity , the mean colour of the remaining early - type galaxies in this magnitude range will be redder than expected from an extrapolation of the cm relation .",
    "we do not see this effect , and therefore conclude that the bluening of early - type galaxies at faint magnitudes due to metallicity should not contribute more than marginally to the faint blue population we detect .",
    "the blue colours should therefore reflect the star formation .",
    "further support for this conclusion comes from ferreras & silk who determine rest frame @xmath184 ( @xmath61 2000 ) to @xmath39 colours of early - type galaxies in cl0939 + 4713 at @xmath185 . comparing the observed colours to synthetic models with different star formation histories , metallicities and dust models , they find that the bluening at faint magnitudes is consistent with at least a fraction of the stars in the galaxies being young .",
    "low metallicities alone are insufficient to explain the observed colours .",

    ", we calculate the luminosity function , the radial distribution of galaxies within the cluster , as well as the distribution of early - type and late - type galaxies . with this knowledge we can directly understand e.g. , the dependence of the butcher - oemler effect on such parameters as radius and magnitude cut .",
    "we find a steep faint - end slope of the rest frame @xmath38band cluster luminosity function , with @xmath187 .",
    "this is consistent with the slope at faint magnitudes for both local and @xmath188 clusters .",
    "the steepness of the lf is found to be correlated to the radial distance from the cluster centre , with a more shallow slope near the core , compared to the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "this is closely related to the difference found in the radial distribution between bright and faint galaxies , where bright galaxies are more centrally concentrated .",
    "most surveys reporting flatter slopes , @xmath189 , only cover the core region of the cluster , or do not probe the faint population beyond the upturn in the lf .    when we divide the cluster galaxies spectroscopically into early - type and late - type galaxies , we find that these populations have very different lfs .",

    "if the progenitors of todays dwarf galaxies in local clusters have faded by @xmath61 23 magnitudes since @xmath4 , this class of galaxies could contribute to the steep slope seen in cl1601 + 42 .",

    "faint blue galaxies are more numerous , and are present across the whole cluster .",
    "there is , however , a decrease in the surface density at the core , which is consistent with a region close to the core depleted of faint , blue star forming galaxies",

    "<S> photometric redshifts are used to determine the rest frame luminosity function ( lf ) of both early - type and late - type galaxies to @xmath0 -17.6 for the cluster cl1601 + 42 at @xmath1 = 0.54 . </S>",
    "<S> the total lf shows a steep faint - end slope @xmath2 -1.4 , indicating the existence of a numerous population of dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> luminous galaxies , with @xmath3 are mostly red , early - type galaxies , with a lf best described by a gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> faint galaxies are predominantly blue , late - type galaxies , well fitted by a schechter function with @xmath2 -1.7 . </S>",
    "<S> compared to clusters at lower redshift , the steepening of the faint end starts at brighter magnitudes for cl1601 + 42 , which may indicate a brightening of todays dwarf population relative to the giant population with increasing redshift . </S>",
    "<S> early - type galaxies are centrally concentrated , and dominate the core region , implying that the radial gradient of early - type galaxies seen in local clusters is already established at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> bright , late - type galaxies are rare , consistent with a decrease in star formation in field galaxies as they are accreted on to the cluster , while faint , blue galaxies are evenly distributed across the cluster , except for a depletion in the core region . </S>",
    "<S> the blue fraction is @xmath5 0.15 , which is somewhat lower than the butcher - oemler average at @xmath4 . </S>",
