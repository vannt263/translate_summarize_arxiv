    "only five years ago , the first field l dwarfs were discovered in a proper motion survey using eso schmidt plates @xcite and in the deep near - infrared survey ( denis ) @xcite . in the following years , the new spectral type ",
    "l  was defined using the rapidly growing number of discoveries from the 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite and from denis @xcite .",
    "most of the additional l dwarfs found since then are from 2mass @xcite and from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the colour - based search for l dwarfs with denis , 2mass and sdss data has increased the sample size to more than 200 , where the majority of the objects lie at distances larger than 25  pc , the limit of the nearby star catalogue @xcite .",
    "nearby l dwarfs , suitable for detailed follow - up observations , have also been found ( see the list of @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , many nearby l stars are still waiting to be discovered according to the predictions on their number densities from observations @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "the number density of early l dwarfs ( l0.0-l4.5 ) alone is expected to be around 0.002 per cubic parsec @xcite , corresponding to about 70 objects within 20  pc .",
    "the completion of the census of l dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood is important for investigations of the star formation process , the stellar and substellar luminosity function and the initial mass function .",
    "as demonstrated with the recent discovery of three nearby l dwarfs in the southern sky @xcite , the supercosmos sky surveys ( sss ) @xcite provide an effective tool to find nearby extremely red and low - luminosity objects via their proper motion and photographic colour .",
    "the sss cover the whole southern sky with scans of uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) plates in three different passbands ( @xmath7 ) and at different epochs with additional scans of eso schmidt plates . since practically all very nearby stars ( @xmath8  pc ) in the nearby star catalogue @xcite",
    "have large proper motions ( @xmath9  arcsec / yr , i.e. the limit of the new luyten two tenths ( nltt ) catalogue , @xcite ) , we can expect large proper motions for all nearby l dwarfs as well .",
    "the reason for the non - detection of l dwarfs among the nltt stars is the lower limiting magnitude of the first palomar observatory sky survey ( poss-1 ) used by luyten , compared to later schmidt telescope surveys ( poss-2 , ukst , eso ) .",
    "ukst and eso schmidt plates are much deeper with limiting magnitudes of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it was thus possible to find the first free - floating l dwarf in the solar neighbourhood , kelu  1 with @xmath11 ( sss magnitudes ) as high proper motion object on schmidt plates @xcite .",
    "trigonometric parallax measurements @xcite have shown this benchmark l2 dwarf to lie at a distance of 19  pc .    in this paper , we announce the detection of another nearby l dwarf using the proper motion search technique .",
    "in order to estimate the chances to find nearby l dwarfs using sss data , we have looked through the list of known objects ( @xmath6  pc ) in the southern sky . surprisingly , all known l dwarfs could be identified at least in the @xmath1 band data of the sss , except one object , for which no @xmath1 plate measurement was available ( table  [ sssdata ] ) .",
    "this does not mean that we are able to find all these objects in a proper motion survey based on sss , since we need measurements at several epochs for that task .",
    "since all early l dwarfs ( @xmath12l5 ) with @xmath6  pc were detected in both @xmath5 and @xmath1 data , there is a good chance to discover this class of objects as proper motion objects if the epoch difference is not too small .",
    "the epoch differences between @xmath5 and @xmath13 plates are typically 10 - 15 years .",
    "those between @xmath5 and @xmath1 plates are smaller but with at least a few years in many fields still useful . even for late l dwarfs within 20  pc appearing only in the @xmath1 band data , there is the chance to find them in the overlap area of the schmidt plates of different epochs .",
    "former attempts to detect l dwarfs in a proper motion survey based on the apm measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath5 plates @xcite did not lead to success since only early l dwarfs may show up in the @xmath13 band and the search area was restricted to a few thousand square degrees .",
    "there are different possibilities to use the sss data in a search for extremely red proper motion objects . in @xcite ,",
    "the basic search strategy started with looking for objects in the sss catalogues which were not matched with a corresponding object in a different passband to within a nominal search radius of 3  arcsec .",
    "here we used the opposite strategy : in order to find nearby brown dwarf candidates , we set the conditions that 1 ) an object was measured in all three passbands within a matching radius of 6  arcsec , 2 ) the sss computed proper motion ( obtained from comparison of @xmath13 and @xmath5 plates ) is larger than 100  mas / yr , 3 ) the object has star - like image parameters and 4 ) the colours are extremely red , i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the proper motion determination was then improved by further positional information from the @xmath1 plates and from 2mass ( if available ) . only the equatorial zone ( @xmath16 ) suitable for follow - up observations from calar alto",
    "was included in the search .",
    "the target of the present paper was selected as one of the most promising candidates in that search .",
    "it is called ssspm  j0829@xmath41309 since it was found via its proper motion in sss data ( see table  [ sssdata ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\">,<,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     positions are given for the latest available epoch ( in most cases the 2mass positions ) .",

    "the reference for the distance estimate ( rounded to 1  pc , but uncertainties are smaller for all objects with trigonometric parallaxes measured by @xcite ) and some details on the proper motion determination are given in the notes below ( corresponding to no . in first table column ) .",

    "unfortunately , lhs102a with @xmath21 and @xmath22 was too faint to be measured in the ac2000 catalogue @xcite so that no accurate astrometric measurements at epochs before 1977 ( the sss @xmath13 plates ) are available .",

    "all measured proper motions of the objects in table  [ sssdata ] are larger than the nltt limit of 0.18  arcsec / yr . proper motions obtained by @xcite are much more accurate than the sss based proper motions in table  [ sssdata ] .",
    "however , for objects not included in @xcite the use of sss data allowed a first proper motion determination ( denis - p  j0255@xmath447 , sdssp  j1326@xmath400 ) or led to an improved proper motion ( lhs  102b ) .",

    "we classify ssspm  j0829@xmath41309 as an l2 dwarf due to the similarity of its spectrum with that of kelu  1 ( decreasing strength of tio and vo absorption ) , which can also be seen if compared to the higher signal - to - noise spectra of kelu  1 shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are no 2mass magnitudes available for ssspm  j0829@xmath41309 .",
    "the distance estimate has therefore been obtained from a comparison with the photographic sss magnitudes of kelu  1 , for which a trigonometric parallax ( @xmath24  pc ) has been determined by @xcite .",
    "our target is roughly one magnitude brighter in both @xmath5 and @xmath1 so that we get a distance estimate of approximately 12  pc assuming the same absolute magnitude as for kelu  1 .",
    "we have also obtained a higher resolution spectrum of ssspm  j0829@xmath41309 using grism r-100 ( 2 per pixel ) with 1 hour exposure time .",
    "low signal - to - noise features in this spectrum are consistent with lithium absorption ( at 6708 ) and @xmath25 emission .",
    "this interpretation , if true , would make ssspm  j0829@xmath41309 a brown dwarf similar to kelu  1 , but a confirmation by a higher signal - to - noise spectrum is needed .",
    "we have discovered one of the nearest field l dwarfs , ssspm  j0829@xmath41309 , which we classify as l2 dwarf similar to kelu  1 . based on the comparison of sss magnitudes of these two objects we estimate ssspm  j0829@xmath41309 to lie at a distance of about 12  pc .",
