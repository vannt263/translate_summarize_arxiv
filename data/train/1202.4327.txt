    "in the present paper , we study some marginal densities of a self - interacting one dimensional process called the true self - repelling motion ( tsrm ) , defined in @xcite .",
    "the true self - repelling motion is a continuous real - valued process @xmath6 that is locally self - interacting with its past occupation - time : it is pushed away from the places it has visited the most in its past .",
    "this process has a completely singular behavior compared to diffusions : for example , it has a finite variation of order 3/2 , which contrasts with the finite quadratic variation of semi - martingales .",
    "a crucial property of the tsrm is the existence of a continuous density for its occupation - time measure , denoted @xmath1 and named again `` local time '' by analogy with semi - martingales ( see theorem @xmath7 of @xcite ) .",
    "this enables to prove that the tsrm is driven by the negative gradient of its own occupation time density @xmath1 .",
    "written _ formally _ : @xmath8 \\label{tsrm0ic } & x(0)=0 , & & l(0,x)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the driving mechanism is to be considered in a properly regularized form . making proper mathematical sense of this mechanism is the main content of @xcite .",
    "the local time at the current position of the tsrm is denoted by @xmath9 and is called the _",
    "height process_. the processes @xmath0 , the local time @xmath1 and the height @xmath4 scale as follows : @xmath10 throughout this paper , the notation @xmath11 means equality in distribution between the two terms .",
    "scaling and many other features of tsrm and related objects show similarities with the distributions appearing in the kpz ( kardar - parisi - zhang ) universality class .",
    "the computations of the present paper also show resemblances with kpz - related computations ( e.g. the natural appearance of airy functions in both contexts ) . as shown in @xcite and @xcite determinental and",
    "pfaffian structures also appear in the brownian web ( which is in the background of the construction of tsrm ) just like in models belonging to the kpz universality class .",
    "however , it is not yet clear whether there exist some deeper connections between tsrm and kpz",
    ".    we will examine in this paper the distributions of the marginals @xmath0 and @xmath4 at the fixed time @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that it is more convenient to work at first with an exponential random time of parameter @xmath13 independent of the process instead of with a fixed time . with feynman - kac formulas applied for the brownian motion ,",
    "it is possible to deduce explicit expressions for its marginals ( in terms of airy function , confluent hypergeometric functions and mittag - leffler density ) .",
    "it leads to pictures [ fignu1 ] and [ fignu2 ] for @xmath14 .",
    "we found the shape of the density of the position @xmath0 rather unusual and surprizing .",
    "indeed , it has a _ sharp wedge - like local minimum _ at @xmath15 with discontinuous derivative , and global maxima away from zero .",
    "it means that at any positive time , the process still remembers its starting point and it is strongly pushed away from it .",
    "these results are also confirmed by numerical simulations ( see figures [ histx ] . and [ histh ] . ) .",
    "the _ true self - avoiding walk ( tsaw ) _ is a nearest neighbor random walk with long memory on @xmath16 pushed by the negative gradient of its own occupation time measure ( local time ) . for historical background",
