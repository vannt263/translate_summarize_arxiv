    "quasi exactly solvable ( qes ) operators @xcite refer to linear differential operators which preserve a finite dimensional vector space of smooth functions .",
    "they can be used in the framework of quantum mechanics to construct hamiltonians which possess a finite number of algebraic eigenfunctions .",
    "the classification of qes operators constitutes an interesting mathematical problem which generalizes the bochner problem @xcite .",
    "having chosen the vector space @xmath3 of functions to be left invariant , the first trial is to construct a set of basic operators preserving @xmath3 from which all others can be generated in the sense of an enveloping algebra .",
    "the fact of having a set of normal ordering rules for the basic operators is also crucial at this stage .",
    "however , one of the striking aspects of qes operators is their close relation to the theory of representations of lie algebras and superalgebras . in particular the realisations of lie algebras in terms of differential operators",
    "play a crucial role @xcite .    of course",
    ", the fact that qes operators are particular realisations of lie algebras is not a necessary requirement , as shown in @xcite , but it constitutes an advantage because , if so , representation theory helps constructing families of invariant vector spaces . in this paper , we put emphasis on the realisations of the algebra q(2 ) in terms of qes operators .",
    "we discuss some generalities in section ii and give our construction in section iii .",
    "an example of a qes schrdinger equation related to these operators is analyzed in section iv .",
    "we end with concluding remarks and an outlook in section v.",
    "let us denote by @xmath4 the ring of polynomials of degree less or equal to @xmath5 in a real variable @xmath6 .",
    "the main result concerning the construction of qes operators @xcite is the discovery that the linear operators which preserve @xmath4 constitute the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra sl(2 ) in the representation @xmath7    extending this result to the case of linear operators which preserve the vector space @xmath8 it was shown in @xcite that these operators can be assembled from @xmath9 basic operators which can be chosen according to @xmath10 @xmath11 the three operators @xmath12 obey the @xmath13 algebra : @xmath14 = -2t^0\\ , \\ [ t^{\\pm},t^0 ] = \\mp t^{\\pm}\\ ] ] and @xmath15 commutes with all @xmath16 s . in the following these operators",
    "play the role of bosonic operators .",
    "they have to be completed by @xmath17 off - diagonal ones  : @xmath18 @xmath19 with the definition @xmath20 and @xmath21 .      after an algebra ,",
    "the commutation relations between the diagonal operators and the off - diagonal ones can be obtained @xcite  : @xmath22 @xmath23 using the representations of sl(2 ) , these formulae reveal that the set of operators @xmath24 ( and independently @xmath25 ) transforms according to the representation of spin @xmath26 under the adjoint action of @xmath16 s ( they are also called tensorial operators ) .",
    "in fact both @xmath27 and @xmath28 behave exactly the same under the @xmath16 s . in terms of young diagrams ,",
    "the representation generated by the @xmath25 s ( or the @xmath29 s ) is characterized by the young diagram with one line of @xmath30 boxes .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath15 behaves as a grading operator  : @xmath31    one can then convince oneself that the most natural set of ordering rules is obtained when _ anticommutators _ between the @xmath24 s and the @xmath25 s are chosen , which makes the interpretation of the @xmath24s and @xmath25s as fermionic operators natural .",
    "the unpleasant feature about the algebraic structure generated by @xmath32 is that the anticommutators @xmath33 are generically polynomials of degree @xmath30 in the bosonic operators . in the case",
    "@xmath34 the operators constitute an atypical representation of the superalgebra osp(2,2 ) @xcite . for @xmath35 the operators",
    "@xmath36 do not seem to be related to lie superalgebras .",
    "however , we will show in the following section that it is possible to find a relation for @xmath37 .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath37 . this case has the peculiarity that , under the @xmath16 s , the operators @xmath24 and the @xmath29 transform according to the adjoint representation , in other words they transform as triplets of sl(2 ) .",
    "let us characterize a triplet @xmath38 by @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "the following sets of operators @xmath41 therefore transform as triplets under the @xmath16 s .",
    "obviously any linear combination of these triplets ( with coefficients being operators commuting with the @xmath16 s ) also constitutes a triplet .",
    "the case @xmath42 in this sense in special since for @xmath43 no match between the fermionic and the bosonic operators seems to exist .",
    "this is also true for qes operators depending on many variables @xcite . in this case",
    "the diagonal operators obey the commutation relations of sl(v+1 ) with v being the number of independent variables .",
    "the counterpart of the @xmath24 s then corresponds to the completely symmetric representation of sl(v+1 ) with a young diagram containing one line with @xmath30 boxes .",
    "in contrast , the adjoint representation of sl(v+1 ) is characterized by a diagram with @xmath44 lines , the first line with two boxes , the others with one box .",
    "the case @xmath45 , @xmath37 is therefore very peculiar .    to proceed",
    "further we remind that in the case studied here the anticommutators of @xmath24 with @xmath46 lead to quadratic polynomials in the @xmath47 and @xmath15 , the details of which are given in @xcite . in order to obtain a more conventional algebra , we take advantage of the coexistence of three independent triplets of operators and try to simplify the algebra of operators preserving @xmath48 . for this purpose",
    ", we define a new triplet of operators , @xmath49  : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant and @xmath52 is a constant diagonal matrix . if we choose @xmath53 and @xmath54 we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the cartan metric of sl(2 ) . in the representation",
    "used , the non - zero elements of this metric are given by @xmath57 from ( [ linear ] ) it is apparent that the anticommutators @xmath58 are now linear combinations of the bosonic operators .    to establish this result , the identities @xmath59 have to be used , and we introduced the notations @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    as an alternative to the operators ( 2)-(6 ) above",
    ", we propose the set given by @xmath62 and completed by @xmath63 now , @xmath64 are the bosonic operators and @xmath65 the fermionic operators .",
    "they fulfill the ( anti)-commutation relations of the superalgebra q(2 ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath66 this latter set of operators therefore constitutes a series of realisations of the superalgebra q(2 ) by qes operators .",
    "this series is labelled by an integer @xmath5 and the @xmath67 dimensional vector space preserved is @xmath48 .",
    "notice that this result was presented in @xcite , but the calculation was done by  brute force \" .",
    "our derivation uses the representation structure of the operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 and moreover demonstrates the importance of the case @xmath37 .",
    "in this section , we discuss examples of qes schrdinger operators preserving the vector space @xmath68 and construct the eigenvalues for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the pauli matrices , @xmath73 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath5 an integer . to our knowledge",
    ", this hamiltonian is the only possible qes matrix hamiltonian with polynomial potential @xcite ( which can however be generalised through the inclusion of a @xmath74 term ) .",
    "we introduce the following change of basis and variable : @xmath75 then , the hamiltonian reads : @xmath76 which obviously preserves @xmath68 .    as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath67 algebraic eigenvectors of @xmath77 can be constructed . in the limit @xmath78",
    "two decoupled sextic qes hamiltonians are recovered . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the algebraic spectrum of @xmath77 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    for @xmath69",
    "the four eigenvalues are given by @xmath79 and the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath80    the degeneracy of the energy levels for @xmath81 with @xmath82 is lifted for @xmath83 . in the limit @xmath84 ,",
    "two of the eigenvectors ( [ eigenv ] ) converge to linear combinations of the two eigenvectors of the decoupled system with @xmath85 .",
    "the ground state energy corresponds to @xmath86 and both components of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath87 have no nodes . denoting the four algebraic energy levels by @xmath88 , @xmath89 , in increasing order and by @xmath90 , @xmath91 the number of nodes of the two components of the corresponding eigenvector @xmath92 , we obtain :    table 1 +    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath70 , the six algebraic eigenvalues are the solutions of the equation @xmath93 as for the case @xmath69 it is apparent that the spectrum of the equation is invariant under the reflection @xmath94 .",
    "the three values of @xmath95 are plotted as functions of @xmath51 in fig .",
    "this demonstrates in particular that a level degeneracy occurs at @xmath96 .",
    "the reflection symmetry of the energy eigenvalues @xmath94 can be demonstrated for arbitrary values of @xmath5 by using a similar argument as pointed out in @xcite for scalar equations . in the case of ( [ ham ] )",
    "the relevant symmetry of the eigenvalue equation is : @xmath97 of course , as in the case of @xcite , the inclusion of the @xmath74-term in the potential would spoil this reflection symmetry .    to our knowledge",
    ", no qes matrix schrdinger operator is known which preserves @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "in this paper we have given a new construction of the realisations of the super lie algebra q(2 ) by means of qes operators .",
    "this demonstrates that the set of operators preserving the vector space @xmath48 is just isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of q(2 ) .",
    "the quadratic algebra called @xmath100 in @xcite can be replaced by q(2 ) .",
    "the natural extension of these results would be to study @xmath43 .",
    "unfortunately , for generic values of @xmath30 the combination ( [ combi ] ) is limited to @xmath101 , ( @xmath102 ) and no simplification occurs . for even values of @xmath30 ,",
    "multiplets having the same tensorial structure as the @xmath25 s can be constructed out of the @xmath16 s , e.g. for @xmath103 we find  : @xmath104 which behaves as a 5-plet ( similarly to the @xmath27 s under the @xmath16 s ) . considering combinations analog to ( [ combi ] ) @xmath105 we have shown that no values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be constructed such that the anti - commutators @xmath106 are polynomials in the bosonic operators .",
    "another possible extension of these considerations would be the construction of finite difference operators preserving @xmath48 .",
    "it could be checked then , whether such operators obey some deformation of q(2 ) in a similar way as in @xcite where the relevant stucture is the so called quommutator deformation of the lie superalgebra osp(2,2 ) .",
