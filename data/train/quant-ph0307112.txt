    "although guided - wave optical communications are normally carried out using dielectric waveguides , metallic waveguides provide a simpler mode structure for deriving the broadband information rate . in the ideal , lossless case that we consider , such waveguides confine the electromagnetic field into a finite region of space by means of perfectly - reflecting boundaries . in this paper",

    "these modes are characterized by the wave vectors @xcite where the discretization of the transverse components derives from the boundary conditions at the waveguide walls and where the longitudinal component @xmath4 is a positive quantity because we are considering only modes propagating from the sender to the receiver . by introducing the transmission time @xmath5 ( i.e. the time interval in which the sender operates the channel )",

    "a mode with wave vector @xmath6 bounces off the waveguide walls ( see fig .",

    "this means that all the photons of that mode used in the transmission can be ideally enclosed in a box of longitudinal length @xmath8 : assuming periodic boundary conditions @xmath4 can be discretized as @xmath9 with @xmath10 a positive integer .",
    "this relation introduces a nonlinearity in the dependence of the mode frequencies @xmath11@xmath6@xmath12 on the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ s : math ] , this is the main difference between our approach and the free space calculation performed in @xcite .",
    "the communication rate @xmath17 is the maximum number of bits per second that can be transmitted through the channel , and is given by the capacity ( i.e. the maximum of the mutual information between the input and the output of the channel ) divided by the transmission time @xmath5 .",
    "the capacity can be estimated from a quantum mechanical analysis of the communication in which each symbol @xmath18 , transmitted with probability density @xmath19 , is associated with a quantum state @xmath20 of the hilbert space @xmath21 of the media used in the communication process ( in our case the electromagnetic field ) . without any constraints ,",
    "the infinite dimensions of the input space @xmath21 of the system under consideration can accommodate an arbitrary amount of information and the capacity would diverge .",
    "physically it is , thus , sensible to introduce an energy constraint on the accessible input states  @xcite .",

    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath70 that identifies the onset of the asymptotic regime for @xmath76 has a relatively simple physical interpretation . from the density matrix , eq .",
    "( [ rhom ] ) , we see that the occupancy probabilities are highest for the lowest frequency ( lowest photon energy ) modes . from the exact formulation for the partition function , eq .  ( [ z1 ] ) , we see that the triple - integral approximation in eq .",
    "( [ z5 ] ) will be valid when the occupancy probabilities change very little between modes with adjacent energy levels .",
    "the largest such photon - energy spacing occurs for the lowest - frequency modes , and , roughly speaking , is equal to @xmath77 , i.e. , the photon - energy of the waveguide s cutoff frequency .",
    "if we concentrate all of the sender s average power into the lowest frequency mode , the resulting power spectral density will be approximately @xmath78 , and hence @xmath70 equals this spectrum measured in units of the photon energy @xmath79 of the lowest - order mode . the condition @xmath74 then guarantees the desired smooth behavior of the occupancy probabilities , because eq .  ( [ rhom ] ) implies that high - photon - number occupancy of the lowest - order mode will , of necessity , be accompanied by similar occupancy of other low frequency modes .",
    "this analysis clarifies the regime of applicability of the approximation ( [ risult1 ] ) and underlines the importance of the quantity @xmath70 in the definition of maximum rate .      in this section",
    "we calculate the rate @xmath17 when the wideband transmission is limited to using a single direction of the wave vector @xmath6",
    ". we will specify this direction assigning the polar angle @xmath80@xmath6@xmath81 and the azimuth angle @xmath82 . in terms of the discretization parameters",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath10 , these conditions become @xmath83 where the nonlinear relation of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) was used in deriving eq .",
    "( [ cc1 ] ) . in this case , only those modes with @xmath6 compatible with the chosen direction contribute to the partition function sum ( [ z1 ] ) , i.e.    @xmath84 % \\nonumber\\\\&&\\times \\   \\delta_{n_2,n_1\\tan\\varphi{l_2}/{l_1}}\\quad \\delta_{n_1,2n_3{l_1\\sin\\theta}/[{c{\\cal t}(1+\\tan^2\\varphi)^{1/2}\\cos^2\\theta } ] } \\;\\labell{z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , for the sake of simplicity only the tm mode has been considered and where the two kronecker deltas take into account the conditions ( [ cc2 ] ) and ( [ cc1 ] ) .",
    "again working in the high power / high cross - sectional regime ( [ condiz ] ) , the summations can be replaced with integrals and the kronecker deltas become dirac delta functions , so that we find @xmath85 % \\nonumber\\\\&&\\times \\delta\\left(x_2-x_1\\tan\\varphi\\right)\\;\\delta\\left(x_1-x_3",

    "substituting this result into eqs .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) and ( [ sol ] ) , we now find that the maximum rate is @xmath86 if both the te and tm modes of the chosen direction were used for the transmission , then a factor @xmath87 would appear in eq .",
    "( [ risultc ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we calculated the maximum rate @xmath17 for information transmission through an ideal metallic waveguide under an average input power constraint .",
    "in particular we found that when the sender is using all the available modes , @xmath17 scales as @xmath88 , as reported in eq .",
    "( [ risult1 ] ) . this scaling is reminiscent of the free space communication one @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the two cases is that , for waveguides all the positively propagating @xmath6 vectors actually reach the receiver thanks to the reflecting walls of the waveguide . for frequency-@xmath89 propagation over an @xmath90-m - long free space path between identical circular apertures of diameter @xmath91 , there are approximately @xmath92 ^ 2 $ ] low - loss propagation modes , per polarization state @xcite .",
    "in essence , the low - loss modes represent propagation angles that lie within the solid angle subtended by the receiver at the sender .",
    "these low - loss modes can be accounted for by introducing a factor of @xmath93 ( @xmath94 being the channel angular aperture as seen by the sender ) in the free space rate  see sect .",
    "vi a in @xcite .",
    "the lossy free space modes that do not satisfy the preceding angular subtense condition can be used for communication , but their analysis requires inclusion of an accompanying noise source , which is mandated by the quantum theory of loss . as noted at the end of this section ,",
    "finding the capacity of the lossy propagation channel is a considerably more difficult problem .",
    "apart from these physical considerations , a technical difference between our calculation and the free space analysis is also evident . in deriving their result , the authors of @xcite instead of using eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) , calculate the maximum rate as @xmath95 where @xmath18 is the polar angle of the mode wave vector @xmath6 and the maximum is performed over the mode states @xmath33@xmath46@xmath96 ( @xmath28 here counts the different polarizations of free space electromagnetic waves ) .",
    "the presence of the term @xmath97 is introduced in the sum to take into account the difference in the longitudinal speed of mode propagation .",
    "[ in our calculation it is the nonlinear eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) that takes care of this ] .",
    "accordingly , the power constraint is calculated as @xmath98}{\\cal t}\\cos\\theta \\;\\labell{power2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this procedure assumes implicitly that the maximum communication rate is achieved by a global state of the input modes which is unentangled over @xmath6 .",
    "this assumption is correct as can be seen ( at least for the waveguide communication protocol studied here ) from the factorized form of the state in eq .",
    "( [ rhom ] ) . in order to compare the two approaches , we have calculated the maximum rate of the waveguide using eqs .",
    "( [ cas ] ) and ( [ power2 ] ) in place of ( [ rate ] ) and ( [ power ] ) .",
    "the results are , predictably , similar to the ones reported in sec .",
    "[ s : math ] , even though the numerical factor differs : in fact , for multimode communication and high power regime , we now find @xmath99 smaller than eq .",
    "( [ risult1 ] ) by a @xmath100 factor , which derives from the particular choice of maximization of eq .",
    "( [ cas ] ) .",
    "if we consider the case of a single directional mode , on the other hand , @xmath17 scales as @xmath101 ( see eq .",
    "( [ risultc ] ) ) : this is the same result obtained in the free space propagation @xcite , apart from the @xmath97 factor that takes into account the decrease in longitudinal propagation speed of the field due to the reflections at the waveguide walls .",
    "all the results discussed in this paper have been obtained in the lossless case , in which all the photons injected into the waveguide arrive to the receiver . in the presence of loss ,",
    "the calculation procedure complicates noticeably : the capacity is no more simply given by the entropy of the initial state , but by the holevo quantity , which is not known to be additive over successive uses of the channel @xcite .",
    "finally , we have not considered the presence of prior entanglement shared between the sender and the receiver . in this case",
    "the rate @xmath17 can be doubled by using the super - dense coding protocol @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the entanglement assisted capacity for the single directional mode case in the presence of loss was given in @xcite , following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we have calculated the maximum communication rate for a perfect waveguide in the two regimes of multimode and single directional - mode communication .",
    "a comparison with the known results on free space communication schemes has been given .",
