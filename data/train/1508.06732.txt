    "the first extension to a complex multilevel stirap case was proposed by b. w. shore in 1991 @xcite , and then more and more attentions are paid to various multilevel schemes , such as the alternating stirap in which all the even transitions occur before the odd ones @xcite , the straddling stirap in which a set of intense pulses corresponding to all intermediate states spans both the stokes and pump pulses @xcite , and the @xmath2 stirap which contains @xmath3-photon pump transitions and @xmath0-photon stokes transitions @xcite .",

    "that result is reasonable because auxiliary middle levels in chainwise schemes would strongly affect the coherence between the initial and target stable states , while in a three - level @xmath1 system an exact dark eigenstate directly correlates the two stable states @xmath161 and @xmath162 which is easy to keep coherent and adiabatic .",

    "the laser amplitude would enhance the phase fluctuations although the non - adiabaticity can be strongly overcome .",
    "note that in our calculations , the laser rabi frequencies required are appropriate and optimal .",
    "we theoretically investigate the efficiency limit of an atom - molecule transfer in a chainwise multilevel adiabatic passage . in the transfer process",
    ", a pair of gaussian - shaped pump and stokes stirap pulses as well as a chain of continuous lasers correlate the initial and target stable states , resulting in the yield of a quasi - dark eigenstate .",
    "the adiabaticity in such a state can be characterized by a generalized adiabatic parameter @xmath107 which enables the study of efficiency optimization .",
    "we perform a detailed description for optimizing the adiabatic parameter and pay special attentions to the order number and laser rabi frequencies , which are fully controllable parameters in experiments . compared to a three - level @xmath1 case in which the efficiency can be unitary in principle",
    ", the final transfer efficiency is found to decrease when more and more middle energy levels are involved .    for realizing a robust atom - molecule transfer in a chainwise system , it is important to consider a proper number of middle levels and proper laser rabi frequencies .",
    "then , not only the selectivity of energy levels is greatly improved , but also the coherence and high transfer efficiency can be maintained . finally , we study the experimental feasibility for such a multilevel chainwise adiabatic passage by considering a realistic seven - level transition in rb@xmath185 atoms .",
    "the effect of laser fluctuations on stirap is also briefly discussed .",
