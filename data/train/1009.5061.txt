    "knowledge of the angle @xmath4 between a star s spin vector and a planet s orbital angular momentum vector contains information about the planetary formation process .",
    "this is especially so for hot jupiters , which are thought to have `` migrated '' inward from large orbital distances @xcite .",
    "one possible migration mechanism involves the gravitational interaction between the planet and the gas in the protoplanetary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". such interactions would preserve a prograde orbit , and could not account for hot jupiters with retrograde orbits ( @xmath5 ) unless the protoplanetary disk was initially misaligned with the star @xcite .",
    "other migration mechanisms , involving planet - planet scattering and kozai cycles , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can produce retrograde orbits .",
    "therefore by measuring @xmath4 one gains insight into the migration history of a particular planetary system .",
    "the rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite occurs when part of the rotating stellar photosphere is eclipsed by a companion star or planet .",
    "this removes a velocity component of the observed rotationally- broadened line profiles , causing a pattern of anomalous radial velocities to be observed throughout the eclipse .",
    "although this effect does not reveal @xmath4 , it does give a measure of @xmath1 , the angle between the _ sky projection _ of the stellar spin vector and the planetary orbital angular momentum .",
    "the rossiter - mclaughlin effect has now been used to measure @xmath1 for 28 transiting planet systems ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .    the transiting hot jupiter wasp-17b , which was discovered by @xcite , is reported to have a planetary radius of @xmath6 and a host star rotational velocity of @xmath7 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the deep transit and fast stellar rotation make it a propitious target for rossiter - mclaughlin effect observations .",
    "@xcite reported that the planet appeared to be in a retrograde orbit , based on three radial - velocity measurements that were obtained during transits .",
    "subsequently , the same group announced further radial velocity measurements of wasp-17 , with denser time sampling @xcite .",
    "those data gave much stronger support to the claim of a retrograde orbit , and indeed gave a value for @xmath1 nearly identical to the value derived by @xcite .",
    "in this letter we present new observations and an independent confirmation of the likely retrograde orbit of the wasp-17 system , though with a significantly different derived value for @xmath1 .",
    "on the night of 2010 may 11 , we obtained high - resolution spectra of wasp-17 using the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph on the 6.5 m magellan ii ( clay ) telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "mike was used in its standard configuration with a 0.35  slit and fast readout mode , which delivered 32 red echelle orders with wavelengths from 5000 - 9500    and with a resolving power of @xmath9 .",
    "spectra were taken continuously for 9 hours , with an interruption of approximately 30 minutes when the star crossed the meridian near the zenith .",
    "a total of 33 spectra of wasp-17 were obtained , with 600  s exposures .",
    "thar calibration frames bracketed each spectrum .",
    "observing conditions were good , although some high , thin clouds were present in the latter half of the night .",
    "the moon was down throughout the wasp-17 observations , and the seeing was 0.5 - 0.7 .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the carnegie mike pipeline developed by dan kelson .",
    "radial velocities were determined via cross correlation with respect to a template spectrum .",
    "we tested different choices for the template spectrum , including a radial velocity standard observed on the same night and various individual wasp-17 spectra .",
    "the lowest inter - order scatter was obtained when using the highest signal - to - noise wasp-17 spectrum as the template .",
    "this spectrum was also obtained at low airmass ( 1.005 ) . for the cross - correlation analysis we selected 13 echelle orders that were free of obvious telluric lines and had a signal - to - noise ratio exceeding 100  pixel@xmath8 .",
    "cross - correlation was performed using the iraf task @xmath10 .",
    "we used the o@xmath11 absorption features from 6870 - 6900    to provide a constant reference for our wavelength solutions for each spectrum .",
    "these absorption bands have been shown to be stable at the 5  m  s@xmath8 level over short timescales @xcite .",
    "mike lacks an atmospheric dispersion corrector , and this resulted in an airmass - dependent systematic trend in the radial velocity measurements , with an amplitude that increased for bluer echelle orders .",
    "the continuous nine - hour monitoring allowed us to track this systematic trend and account for it during the model - fitting procedure , as described in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the order - averaged , airmass - corrected radial velocities are given in table  1 , with uncertainties taken to be the standard deviation of the mean of the results of all 13 orders .",
    "our model for the radial velocity data has the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the calculated radial velocity at time @xmath14 in echelle order @xmath15 ( ranging from 1 to 13 ) , @xmath16 is the radial velocity due to the star s orbital motion ( assumed to be circular ) , @xmath17 is the transit - specific `` anomalous velocity '' due to the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , and @xmath18 are constants specifying the offset between the relative barycentric velocity of wasp-17 and the arbitrary template spectrum that was used to calculate radial velocities . to account for the wavelength - dependent airmass trend mentioned in the previous section , the offset was allowed to be a linear function of both order number @xmath15 ( effectively a wavelength index ) and airmass @xmath19 .",
    "many approaches have been taken to model the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , such as the pixellated photospheric model of , the first - moment approach of @xcite and @xcite , the forward - modeling approach of @xcite or the spectral line fitting of @xcite and @xcite . in our case",
    "the most applicable and convenient model is the analytic formula of @xcite , @xmath20^{3/2}\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\left [ 1 - \\frac{v_p(t)^2}{2v_0 ^ 2 + ( v\\sin i)^2 } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the loss of light during the transit , @xmath22 is the mean radial velocity of the small portion of the photosphere that is hidden by the planet , @xmath23 is the stellar projected rotation rate , and @xmath24 is the velocity width of the spectral lines that would be seen from a small portion of the photosphere ( i.e.  due to mechanisms other than rotation ) .",
    "this formula relates the phase of the transit to the radial velocity anomaly derived from cross - correlation .    to calculate @xmath22 we assumed that the stellar photosphere rotates uniformly with an angle @xmath1 between the sky projections of the spin vector and the orbital angular momentum vector ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "we took @xmath23 to be a free parameter , and @xmath24 was constrained by the condition that the quadrature sum of @xmath24 and @xmath23 should equal the observed total linewidth of 11  km  s@xmath8 @xcite .    to calculate @xmath21",
    ", we assumed a linear limb - darkening law with a fixed coefficient of 0.7 , and used the analytic formulas of @xcite , as implemented by @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the photometric model were the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath25 , orbital inclination @xmath26 , and normalized stellar radius @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the orbital distance ) .",
    "some of the transit characteristics are more tightly constrained by previous observations of photometric transits than by the radial velocity data presented here .",
    "hence , we used gaussian priors for the transit depth @xmath29 , total duration @xmath30 , partial duration @xmath31 , orbital period @xmath32 , and time of transit @xmath33 , based on the results presented by @xcite ( see their table 4 , case 3 ) .",
    "we also used those results to set a gaussian prior for @xmath34 , the orbital velocity semi - amplitude , since our coverage of the spectroscopic orbit is sparse .",
    "all together there are 11 adjustable parameters in our model fit , of which 7 are mainly determined by our new radial velocity data : @xmath1 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the time of conjunction @xmath33 .",
    "the other 4 parameters , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath34 , are controlled mainly by the priors .",
    "we determined the best - fitting parameter values and their 68.3% confidence limits with a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) algorithm that we have described elsewhere ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the likelihood was taken to be @xmath40 with @xmath41 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the radial velocity measured at time @xmath43 in echelle order @xmath15 , and @xmath44 are the calculated radial velocities .",
    "we found that the choice @xmath45  m  s@xmath8 gave @xmath46 for the best - fitting model , and is also approximately equal to the scatter observed in the residuals to the best - fitting model , so we used this value in the mcmc analysis .",
    "table  [ tbl : params ] gives the resulting best - fit parameter values .",
    "figure  [ fig : rv ] shows the airmass - corrected radial velocities as a function of time , along with the best - fitting model and the residuals .",
    "figure  [ fig : airmass ] illustrates the airmass correction for three separate echelle orders .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcmc ] displays the marginalized , joint _ a posteriori _ probability distributions involving @xmath1 and the other model parameters .",
    "the radial velocity data clearly exhibit an `` upside - down '' rossiter - mclaughlin effect : an anomalous blueshift for the first half of the transit , followed by an anomalous redshift for the second half .",
    "our result for the projected stellar rotation velocity , @xmath47  km  s@xmath8 , is in agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , our finding of @xmath48  deg does not agree with either of the previously reported results .. ] @xcite found @xmath49  deg , although this result was based on only 3 data points .",
    "more significant is the result by @xcite of @xmath50  deg , based on two data sets densely sampling the transit .",
    "the difference between our result for @xmath1 and that of @xcite is @xmath51  deg , or 3.5@xmath52 away from zero .",
    "we do not know the reason for the discrepancy .",
    "we have sparser coverage of the spectroscopic orbit than did @xcite , but this did not bias our results : we used the results of @xcite to set a prior for @xmath34 , and also found that the results for @xmath34 and @xmath1 are uncorrelated .",
    "we also checked to see if the gap in our time coverage when wasp-17 was at zenith has biased our results : we fitted fake data with @xmath53 and the same time coverage and velocity errors as our mike data , and found @xmath54 , i.e. , the result was not biased .",
    "we also fitted the @xcite data ourselves and found @xmath55 .",
    "although this reduces the discrepancy in results to 2.5@xmath52 , it indicates that the differences in @xmath1 values can not be attributed solely to differences in fitting procedures .",
    "an important step in our data analysis was fitting and removing the airmass trend in our radial velocity data .",
    "we fitted for the airmass terms simultaneously with the rossiter - mclaughlin model , and therefore our results do take into account any correlations between the airmass parameters and the other parameters including @xmath1 .",
    "however , these errors are internal to the choice of our model , which is linear in airmass and order number .",
    "this model seems reasonable and provides a satisfactory fit to the data ; however it is impossible to exclude the possibility that the true dependence is more subtle and that this has altered the shape of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "according to the ephemeris of @xcite , the predicted time of conjunction for the event we observed is hjd  2,455,328.6814@xmath56 , which is earlier by @xmath3  min than the time we measured .",
    "either the transits are nonperiodic , or the uncertainties in at least some of the transit times were underestimated .",
    "a straight - line fit to the epochs and transit times in table  5 of @xcite gives @xmath57 with 11 degrees of freedom , i.e. , statistically different than random .",
    "for this reason , it is likely that the true uncertainty in the period is larger than the previously reported uncertainty , by a factor of about @xmath58 or 1.8 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that our timing offset from the ephemeris of @xcite is at most a 1.5@xmath52 discrepancy .",
    "the uncertainty in the time of conjunction would be best addressed in the future by obtaining high - quality photometric data simultaneously with spectroscopic observations .",
    "however we note that this ephemeris discrepancy can not account for the difference between our result for @xmath1 and that of @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath1 is consistent with a retrograde orbit , but it must be remembered that @xmath1 is a sky - projected quantity .",
    "the true angle @xmath4 between the vectors is given by @xmath59 where @xmath26 and @xmath60 are the line - of - sight inclinations of the orbital and stellar angular momentum vectors , respectively .",
    "using @xmath61  deg from @xcite , and supposing @xmath60 to be drawn from an `` isotropic '' distribution ( uniform in @xmath62 ) , we find @xmath63 with 99.73% confidence . in this sense ,",
    "the wasp-17b orbit is very likely to be retrograde ( @xmath64 ) , although nearly pole - on configurations ( @xmath65 ) are possible .",
    "the assumption of an isotropic distribution in @xmath60 neglects our prior knowledge that main - sequence stars have somewhat predictable rotation rates , and therefore that the measured value of @xmath66 also bears information about @xmath60 .",
    "recently , @xcite used this insight to seek evidence for small values of @xmath67 ( and therefore large spin - orbit misalignments along the line of sight ) among all the transit hosts",
    ". he did not identify wasp-17 as one of the systems with a likely small value of @xmath67 . in light of this analysis",
    ", our observation of a large @xmath1 favors a more nearly retrograde orbits over polar orbits .",
    "it is now ten years since the first reported detection of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect due to a transiting planet . as with many other properties of extrasolar planets ,",
    "the rossiter - mclaughlin effect observations have thrown up surprises , with systems that appear very different from those in our own solar system .",
    "the hot jupiter hat - p-7b was found to be on a polar or retrograde orbit , by independent measurements of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similarly wasp-17b has now been confirmed to be in a retrograde orbit by two independent groups ( * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) .",
    "it now seems that at least a fraction of hot jupiters are migrating by mechanisms other than disk migration , or that proto - planetary disks are frequently misaligned with their stars .",
    "the work of @xcite suggested that we may be seeing two different populations of hot jupiters that have migrated via different mechanisms .",
    "the results of this work adds weight to that suggestion , however a larger statistical sample will be needed before this can be robustly confirmed .",
    "only a larger sample of planets with known @xmath1 values will allow correlations with parameters such as planetary mass , planetary radius , metallicity , and stellar mass to be robustly tested .",
    "@xcite have proposed that misaligned hot jupiters occur preferentially around hot stars ( @xmath68  k ) , of which wasp-17 is a supporting example .",
    "fortunately the discovery rate of transiting planets orbiting bright stars is set to rise due to large - scale ground - based surveys such as superwasp @xcite and hat - south @xcite , and proposed space - based projects such as tess @xcite and plato @xcite .",
