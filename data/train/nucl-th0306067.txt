    "recent analyses of hypernuclear nonmesonic decay reveal the importance of short - range interaction of baryonic weak transition @xcite .",
    "it is , in fact , realized that the momentum transfer is large due to the @xmath10 mass difference , and therefore the short range interaction becomes important .",
    "we proposed to treat the short range part of @xmath7 interaction using the valence quark picture of the baryon and the effective four - quark weak hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we found that the direct quark ( dq ) process gives significantly large contribution and shows qualitatively different features from the meson exchange contribution , especially in its isospin structure .",
    "the kaon exchange contribution also largely enhance the @xmath11 ratio due to its spin structure @xcite .    there remains , however , another problem , i.e. , experimental values of the proton asymmetry from polarized hypernucleus are incompatible with the theoretical values , which is closely related to the @xmath8 transition amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 amplitude is relatively small and therefore masked by the @xmath9 amplitude , but it is important to clarify the breaking of the @xmath12 rule for the nonmesonic weak decay of hypernuclei .",
    "in fact , the quark model treatments of @xmath7 transition predict large breaking of the @xmath13 rule in @xmath8 transition channel @xcite .    for the case of double-@xmath6 hypernuclei ,",
    "the nonmesonic decay is induced not only by the nucleon but also by the other @xmath6 hyperon : @xmath14 .",
    "the two - body part of the nonmesonic decay rate of double-@xmath6 hypernuclei is classified as @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the @xmath17 transition which is available when the virtual @xmath18 exists @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 represents the @xmath0 transition , which is a characteristic transition for the multi-@xmath6 system .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath0 transition should be distinguishable from the @xmath7 decay mode because the hyperon with high momentum is emitted once it occurs in double-@xmath6 hypernucleus .",
    "thus the hyperon - induced decay mode provides us with valuable information on the @xmath20 baryon - baryon interaction @xcite .    in sec.[sec : trr ] , the hyperon - induced decay rate , @xmath19 , is expressed in terms of two - body amplitudes corresponding to the @xmath0 transition . in sec.[sec : pot ] , we construct the meson exchange and dq potential for the @xmath0 transition . in sec.[sec : res ] , we show the result of the @xmath0 transition rate in @xmath1he .",
    "finally , sec.[sec : con ] is devoted for the conclusion of this work .",
    "for the nonmesonic weak decay of double-@xmath6 hypernuclei , the hyperon induced decay mode , @xmath0 , becomes possible besides the usual @xmath7 transition .",
    "now we concentrate on the novel @xmath0 decay .",
    "the @xmath5 transition rate is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath5 transition amplitude , @xmath23 is the total spin of initial hypernucleus , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are momenta of emitted particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , hyperon and nucleon .",
    "the summation indicates a sum over all quantum numbers of the initial and final particle systems .",
    "the @xmath26-function for the energy conservation is given by @xmath27 where the hyperon binding energy is taken as @xmath28mev @xcite .",
    "after the decomposition of angular momentum , the explicit form of @xmath22 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the transition potential and @xmath31 is the wave function of the @xmath32 or yn two - body system in the configuration space .",
    "the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 indicate the angular momentum , spin , and total spin for two - body system , respectively .    in order to extract the @xmath32 state from the double-@xmath6 hypernucleus , we assume , for simplicity , that the @xmath32 state with @xmath8 and @xmath36 is decoupled from the residual nuclei : @xmath37 where the double-@xmath6 state is always in @xmath38 state in the ground state . the important point of the study",
    "the @xmath0 process is that the initial @xmath32 pair is in the @xmath38 state and thus the @xmath0 transition occurs only in the @xmath8 channel .",
    "the @xmath8 transition amplitude is not well studied in the @xmath7 decay , because the @xmath9 amplitude is much larger .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 decay directly probes the @xmath8 transition amplitude and therefore plays a complementary role .",
    "the initial double-@xmath6 state is written in terms of the shell model wave function of @xmath39 state : @xmath40^{j=0 }    = \\left [ \\phi_{0s}^{b_r}(\\vec{r } )       \\times      \\phi_{0s}^{b_r}(\\vec{r } ) \\right]^{j=0 } \\label{eq : wf}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is assumed to be a gaussian with size parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the last expression of eq.([eq : wf ] ) is the wave function in terms of the relative and center - of - mass coordinate with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the wave function for the final @xmath49 state is assumed as the plane wave with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath42 parameter is taken as @xmath52fm which fit on the r.m.s .",
    "radius of @xmath6 in @xmath1he @xcite .",
    "in addition , we introduce phenomenological correlation functions . for the initial @xmath32 wave function ,",
    "we multiply to the uncorrelated wave function @xmath53 with @xmath54fm , @xmath55@xmath56 , @xmath57fm , @xmath58 , according to ref.@xcite . on the other hand , for the final @xmath59 state",
    ", we multiply @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a spherical bessel function with @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "in order to describe the weak @xmath64 transition , we adopt the quark - meson hybrid model , which is focused on the quark degrees of freedom in a short - range region . at long and medium distances ,",
    "the transition is induced mainly by the one pion exchange ( ope ) and one kaon exchange ( oke ) processes .",
    "the general form of @xmath64 transition potential in the meson exchange picture is given by @xmath65      { \\frac{1}{{\\vec q}^2 + { \\tilde m}_{i}^2 } }      \\left ( {   \\frac { \\lambda_{i}^2 -{\\tilde m}_{i}^2 }                { \\lambda_{i}^2 + { \\vec q}^2    }       } \\right)^2",
    "g_w      [ \\bar{u}_n ( a+b \\gamma_5 ) u_\\lambda ]    \\label{eq : ope}\\ ] ] where the coupling constants @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , shown in table [ tab : swcc ] , are chosen properly for each transition . a monopole form factor with cutoff parameters , @xmath70 = 800 mev and @xmath71 mev ,",
    "are employed for each vertex . as the energy transfer is significantly large ,",
    "we introduce the effective meson mass : @xmath72 the kaon exchange potential can be constructed similarly .",
    "both the strong and weak coupling constants are evaluated under the assumption of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "note that , for oke , it involves the strangeness transfer and thus the strong and weak vertices should be exchanged .",
    ".the strong and weak coupling constants for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange potentials .",
    "the strong coupling constants are taken from nijmegen strong couplings @xcite .",
    "the weak coupling constants are in unit of @xmath73 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , > , < , < , > , < , < , > \" , ]     [ tab : he6ll ]    we compare our results with the previous calculations carried out by itonaga et al .",
    "@xcite and parreo et al .",
    "we all agree the bare pion - exchange amplitudes in the @xmath74 transitions @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : he6ll ] , ref .",
    "@xcite includes effects of two - pion exchange in the scalar ( @xmath75 ) channel as well as the vector ( @xmath76 ) channel .",
    "@xcite contains all the pseudoscalar mesons and the vector mesons exchanged between @xmath32 .",
    "ref.@xcite took two different approaches for the final state interaction . the full calculation ( f )",
    "is based on the scattering @xmath77 matrix in the final states , while an effective treatment ( e ) evaluates the transition amplitudes by multiplying a correlation function to the relative wave function .",
    "they pointed out that the full calculation enhances @xmath78 while it reduces @xmath79 .",
    "the effective treatment does not include the conversion from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .    in the present work , we make an effective treatment of the final state interactions .",
    "therefore , our results have to be compared to the ones in ref.@xcite(e ) .",
    "our calculation is similar to their effective treatment and thus the @xmath78 enhancement due to the final state interaction is not shown .",
    "the total decay rates in our results are reduced by a factor about two due to the larger @xmath42 parameter for the @xmath6 wave function .",
    "we note that if the same @xmath42 value is used , our results agree with the ( e ) results in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also point out that the ratio @xmath82 is fixed to @xmath83 by the @xmath12 rule in the meson exchange calculations .",
    "in the double @xmath6 hypernuclear system , the novel decay mode , @xmath0 , is allowed .",
    "the hyperon - induced decay rates are much smaller than the decay rate of free @xmath6 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 transition occurs only in the @xmath8 channel . although the @xmath0 transition is not easy to detect experimentally , it is important to extract the information about the @xmath8 transition .",
    "our result shows that the dq process gives significant contribution to the @xmath0 transition .",
    "it strongly suppresses the pc amplitude for the @xmath85 transition and the pv amplitude for the @xmath86 transition .",
    "furthermore the dq largely breaks the empirical @xmath12 rule . unlike the @xmath7 transition",
    ", we have an opportunity to check directly the breaking of @xmath12 dominance for the @xmath86 transition .",
