    "this method could be used for site characterization to obtain relevant inputs for tomographic ao design and performance evaluation , or to help optical turbulence forecast .    of course , inter - comparisons are needed , with the reference profilers slodar , g - scidar and mass , and with new - generation profilers , such as pml ( profiler of moon limb )  @xcite and stereo - scidar  @xcite . a multi - instrument campaign dedicated to this comparison",
    "is foreseen  @xcite .",
    "tomographic ao systems will include several wavefront sensors , leading to multi - directional slodars  @xcite , but external @xmath0 profilers such as co - slidar would be useful for the calibration of these systems .    moreover , some hardware and architecture improvements are possible on the co - slidar instrument . the optical transmission could be increased and the sources could be separated on two different detectors to tune the detector gain on each star , to observe binary stars with visible magnitude up to @xmath141 and thus to allow a better sky coverage . with two detectors",
    "the images size would be smaller and that would speed up their recording , to enable wind profiling .",
    "outer scale profiling is also possible .",
    "eventually , co - slidar could be used as an automatic monitor , by means of real time data processing .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first - on sky @xmath0 profiles estimated with the co - slidar profiler . the improved reconstruction method has been described and its latest performance has been illustrated in an end - to - end simulation , before testing it in a real astronomical observation on the @xmath1  m meo telescope .",
    "@xmath0 profiles have been estimated with the co - slidar method and compared to those reconstructed from correlations of slopes only or of scintillation only , highlighting the fact that the two kinds of correlations are complementary and allow the reconstruction of low and high altitude layers . with this co - slidar instrument ,",
    "we have reconstructed @xmath69 turbulent layers , with a resolution of @xmath146  m , from the ground up to @xmath144  km .",
    "we have compared our results with the @xmath0 profiles deduced from ncep / ncar reanalysis , and we have found a good agreement between the estimations . in a nutshell , we have shown that co - slidar is a sub - kilometric resolution @xmath0 profiler working on meter class telescopes .",
    "the method now needs cross - calibrations with other optical profilers in multi - instrument campaigns .",
    "considered future works include improvements to gain a better sky - coverage , performing real - time @xmath0 estimations , and extensions to wind and outer scale profiling .",
    "this work has been performed in the framework of a ph.d .",
    "thesis supported by onera , the french aerospace lab , and the french direction gnrale de larmement ( dga ) .",
    "the authors are very grateful to the team operating at meo station , for the use of the @xmath1  m telescope and their help and support throughout the whole campaign . the authors also want to thank b. fleury and f. mendez for help in the optical design , optical alignment and optomechanics .",
    "they are also grateful to y. hach for computing the ncep / ncar @xmath0 profiles , and to v. michau for fruitful exchanges .",
    "in co - slidar , the correlations are estimated from a finite number of frames .",
    "the so - called convergence noise corresponds to the difference between these empirical estimations and the exact mathematical expectations .    in this appendix",
    ", we illustrate the methodology for computing @xmath49 in the simplified case of the estimation of the variance of a scalar gaussian random variable by expressing the variance of the convergence noise .",
    "let @xmath147 be a centered gaussian random variable such as @xmath148 and @xmath149 a realization of @xmath147 .",
    "an estimation of the variance of @xmath147 , @xmath150 ( which is a ml estimate because we have assumed @xmath147 to be gaussian ) , is given by : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the number of realizations of @xmath147 .",
    "the convergence noise is by definition : @xmath153 it is , in turn , a random variable .",
    "its mean value is : @xmath154 the variance of @xmath155 can be written as : @xmath156    the variance of the convergence noise @xmath157 can therefore be deduced from the variance of @xmath147 . in practice",
    "the latter is unknown , so we approximate @xmath150 , in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : convergence_noise_variance ] ) , by its empirical estimate @xmath158 ."
