    "the gauge / string theory correspondence , originally formulated for superconformal @xmath2 super yang  mills ( sym ) theory , has in recent years been proven useful to yield relevant information on less supersymmetric and non conformal gauge theories too ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) .    in order to build geometries dual to such more `` realistic '' gauge theories ,",
    "one usually has to follow a two - step procedure :    1 .",
    "_ reduce supersymmetry _ by choosing an appropriate closed string background , such as an orbifold or a calabi ",
    "yau manifold , known to break a certain amount of supersymmetry ; 2 .   _",
    "break conformal invariance _ by engineering suitable d - brane configurations ( thus acting on the open string channel ) with non - trivial world - volume topology .    by following the above strategy ,",
    "several string backgrounds were found , realizing for instance four - dimensional @xmath0 and @xmath3 sym , such as configurations of fractional d3-branes on orbifolds and on the conifold , and of d5-branes wrapped on two - cycles inside calabi  yau manifolds .    in all these cases , low energy supergravity solutions describing the d - brane configurations",
    "have been used to succesfully extract some relevant pieces of information on the dual gauge theories , such as for instance :    * _ at the perturbative level _ , the running coupling constant , the chiral anomaly and the moduli space of the gauge theory ; * _ at the non - perturbative level _",
    ", the action of an instanton , realizations of chiral symmetry breaking and gaugino condensation , effective superpotentials and the tension of confining strings .    here we concentrate on showing how it is possible to extract some non - perturbatively generated _ effective superpotentials for @xmath0 gauge theories _ starting from supergravity solutions and some geometric considerations .    a fundamental fact we will use is that @xmath0 gauge theories can be realized in the framework of `` geometric transitions ''  @xcite , where one engineers them via configurations of d5-branes wrapped on two - cycles of resolved calabi  yau manifolds .",
    "the resulting geometry then flows to the one of a deformed manifold , where branes are replaced by fluxes .    in this context , the effective superpotential of the gauge theory is given in terms of the fluxes of the geometry by the following expression  @xcite : @xmath4\\,.\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the complex three - form field strength of type iib supergravity , @xmath6 is the holomorphic @xmath7-form of the calabi  yau manifold , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( which are respectively compact and non - compact ) form a standard basis of orthogonal three - cycles on the manifold .",
    "let us start from the prototype example of the geometric transition framework , the _ conifold _ ( a cone over the einstein manifold @xmath10 ) , which is a singular non - compact calabi ",
    "yau threefold described by the equation @xmath11 in @xmath12 , where : @xmath13    in order to engineer pure @xmath0 @xmath14 sym , we put @xmath15 fractional d3-branes at the tip of the cone ( these fractional branes have the interpretation of d5-branes wrapped on the two - cycle of the resolved manifold in the limit where its size shrinks to zero ) .",
    "the geometric transition brings us to the deformed conifold , which is a smooth manifold defined by replacing   with : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a real positive deformation parameter .",
    "the fractional branes are replaced by the flux of @xmath18 through the newly blown - up compact three - cycle @xmath19 and through the non - compact three - cycle @xmath20 , as shown in .",
    "-flux through the three - cycles of the deformed manifold.[f : conifold ] ]    the corresponding supergravity solution is the _ warped deformed conifold _  @xcite .",
    "since we are going to use the solution for computing the fluxes needed in  , we only need the expressions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 from  @xcite : @xmath23\\,,\\label{b2ks}\\\\      f_3 = \\frac{{\\ensuremath{{g_{\\rm s}}}}n{\\ensuremath{{l_{\\rm s}}}}^2}{2 } \\left\\{g^5 \\wedge g^3 \\wedge g^4          + d\\left [ f(\\tau ) \\left(g^1 \\wedge g^3 + g^2 \\wedge g^4\\right)\\right ] \\right\\}\\,,\\label{f3ks}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are appropriate one - forms defined on the deformed conifold and where : @xmath25 are functions of a dimensionless radial variable @xmath26 .",
    "let us consider the large @xmath26 limit , where we define a new radial coordinate @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 being a regulator at short distances . in terms of @xmath27 ,",
    "the metric explicitly becomes the one of a cone over @xmath10 , and we have  @xcite : @xmath30 from  , we can compute the fluxes of @xmath18 through the cycles @xmath19 and @xmath20 defined by : @xmath31 using the fact that @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we get : @xmath34 where we had to introduce a cut - off @xmath35 in order to perform the integration over @xmath27 .",
    "now we need to compute the periods of the holomorphic @xmath7-form : @xmath36 the computation ( see for example  @xcite ) reduces to the one of the one - dimensional integral @xmath37 , where the extrema of integration are given by @xmath38 $ ] for the @xmath19-cycle , and by @xmath39 $ ] for the @xmath20-cycle . notice that we are using the same cut - off used in the calculation of the fluxes of @xmath18 , and that the power @xmath40 is due to the fact that the coordinates in  , as well as @xmath17 , have dimensions of the @xmath41 power of a length , as can be seen from the full metric in  @xcite .",
    "the periods of @xmath6 then read : @xmath42 and we can expand the @xmath20-period for large @xmath35 , getting : @xmath43    we can now substitute the results  , , inside the formula  , obtaining the following expression for the effective gauge superpotential in terms of supergravity quantities : @xmath44    we still have to express   in terms of gauge theory quantities .",
    "this can be done by implementing the `` stretched string '' energy / radius relations : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the subtraction scale of the gauge theory , @xmath47 is the dynamical scale , and @xmath48 is naturally identified , due to its engineering dimensions , with the gaugino condensate @xmath49 of the dual gauge theory .    reinstating the correct units in  , neglecting the unimportant term independent of @xmath49 and using the above energy / radius relations , we finally get the following answer ( first derived in this setup in  @xcite ) for the effective superpotential : @xmath50 this is the well - known veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz superpotential for pure @xmath0 sym  @xcite .",
    "we have therefore seen that supergravity , together with some geometric considerations , is able to give us the correct answer for the non - perturbatively generated effective superpotential of the dual gauge theory .",
    "we now want to engineer sqcd , namely an @xmath0 gauge theory with fundamental matter . to achieve this goal ,",
    "let us consider a system of fractional d3-branes transverse to a @xmath1 orbifold  @xcite .",
    "this orbifold , which breaks bulk supersymmetry down to eight supercharges , is defined by the action on the complex coordinates @xmath51 of the generators of the two @xmath52 factors : @xmath53    fractional branes are the most elementary brane objects on orbifolds  @xcite .",
    "they are defined by the fact that the chan  paton factors of the string attached to them transform in irreducible representations of the orbifold group .",
    "since @xmath1 has four irreducible one - dimensional representations , we will have four different types of fractional branes , that we denote with a , b , c , d. they are charged under the open string twisted sectors , and they are stuck at the orbifold fixed point @xmath54 .    the low - energy theory living on a generic system of fractional d3-branes of all types",
    "is a four - dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory with gauge group @xmath55 and twelve bifundamental chiral multiplets , whose quiver diagram is depicted in  a. if we take @xmath15 branes of type a and @xmath56 of type b ( and no other branes , thus realizing the quiver diagram of  b ) , and concentrate only on the low - energy degrees of freedom living on the branes of type a , we see that we obtain @xmath0 @xmath57 sqcd with @xmath56 fundamental flavours of `` quarks '' @xmath58 and `` antiquarks '' @xmath59  @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will concentrate on the case @xmath60 , namely the affleck ",
    "dine  seiberg theory  @xcite .    .",
    "@xmath61 the full diagram . each node @xmath62 represents a gauge group factor @xmath63 with the corresponding vector multiplet , while each oriented arrow from node @xmath62 to node @xmath64 represents a chiral multiplet in the @xmath65 representation .",
    "@xmath66 the diagram of the system of d - branes which realizes @xmath57 sqcd with @xmath56 flavours on the branes of type a.[f : quivers ] ]    let us first notice that the brane configuration under study encodes very naturally information about the classical moduli space of the gauge theory .",
    "the main observation is that the fractional branes of type a and b have the same charge under the sectors twisted by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but opposite charge under the sector twisted by @xmath69 .",
    "this means that a superposition a@xmath70b is only charged under this latter twisted sector , and is therefore no longer constrained to stay at the orbifold fixed point .",
    "rather , it can freely move in the @xmath71 plane ( provided of course that we introduce brane images on the covering space in order to make the configuration invariant under the orbifold action ) .",
    "this fact gives a natural geometrical meaning to the moduli space of @xmath0 sqcd for @xmath72 , as shown in  a. in fact , we can form @xmath56 a@xmath70b superpositions , and place them at arbitrary points in the @xmath71 plane , while the remaining @xmath73 fractional branes of type a are still stuck at the origin .",
    "this means that the low - energy effective description of the theory is in terms of a @xmath74 gauge theory together with arbitrary expectation values of the meson matrix @xmath75 , which in our case are mapped to the arbitrary positions of the a@xmath70b superpositions . without loss of generality",
    ", we can make the meson matrix proportional to the identity , @xmath76 , by putting all superpositions at a point @xmath77 of the real axis of the @xmath71 plane , where @xmath78 , as in  b.     a@xmath70b superpositions at arbitrary points of the @xmath71 plane . @xmath66 the configuration which makes the meson matrix proportional to the identity . @xmath79 the compact 1-cycle @xmath80 and the non - compact one @xmath81 in the @xmath82 plane.[f : ads ] ]    we would now like to pass to the computation of the non - perturbative effective superpotential .",
    "the ( singular ) supergravity solution describing fractional d3-branes on @xmath1 was found in  @xcite .",
    "again , we only need the explicit expression of @xmath18 , which in the case of the configuration depicted in  b is : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , are the anti - self dual @xmath86-forms dual to the shrinking 2-cycles @xmath87 of the orbifold geometry and : @xmath88\\,,\\ ] ]    in order to use  , we need to identify the appropriate three - cycles @xmath8 and @xmath9 in our orbifold geometry .",
    "we can introduce them by simply taking the direct product of the two - cycles @xmath87 with suitable one - cycles on the @xmath82 planes .",
    "specifically , we define : @xmath89 where the compact cycles @xmath80 and the non - compact cycles @xmath81 in the @xmath82 plane are orthogonal to each other and are shown in  c. we now have all the necessary ingredients to compute the fluxes of @xmath18 : @xmath90 where , similarly to the case considered in the previous section , we have introduced long and short distance cut - offs @xmath35 and @xmath29 in order to perform the integration over the non - compact cycles @xmath9 .",
    "notice also that we have expanded the result assuming @xmath91 .",
    "the next step is to compute the periods of the holomorphic @xmath7-form @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath1 orbifold is defined by the equation @xmath92 in @xmath12 , where : @xmath93 in order to de - singularize this space , we again introduce a positive deformation parameter @xmath94  @xcite , and replace   by : @xmath95 in this deformed orbifold , the periods of @xmath96 can be computed in a way analogous to the one followed in the previous section , and one gets : @xmath97    by substituting   and   in  , and implementing again the `` stretched string '' energy / radius relations , which now read : @xmath98 we get the following result for the effective superpotential of @xmath0 @xmath57 sqcd with @xmath72 fundamental flavours : @xmath99          - s\\ \\ln \\frac{m^{2 n_f}}{\\lambda^{2 n_f}}\\,.\\ ] ] this is precisely the expected expression of the taylor  veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz superpotential  @xcite .",
    "minimizing with respect to @xmath49 , we are finally left with the affleck ",
    "dine  seiberg superpotential  @xcite : @xmath100^{\\frac{1}{n - n_f } }                  = ( n - n_f ) \\ \\left[\\ \\frac{\\lambda^{3n - n_f}}{\\det m}\\ \\right]^{\\frac{1}{n - n_f}}\\ ] ] ( recall that we are working with a diagonal meson matrix so that @xmath101 ) .",
    "some final comments are in order .",
    "first , notice that our brane construction is valid also for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "in the former case , we recover again the veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz superpotential  , while in the latter case our result   correctly reproduces the quantum constraint @xmath104 .    on the other hand , for @xmath105 our construction breaks down , which is a signal that one should incorporate seiberg duality  @xcite into the picture .",
    "an investigation of this issue in a related setup was performed in  @xcite with formal methods , but a full understanding in terms of a supergravity dual is still lacking .",
