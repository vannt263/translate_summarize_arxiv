    "high resolution near - infrared ( near - ir ) observations over the past decade have revealed the presence of massive , unusual stars in the inner 50 pc of the galaxy , where observations suffer 20@xmath430 visual magnitudes of obscuration .",

    "based on the evolutionary stages of the stars , this cluster is likely to be 3.5 myr old , with a total estimated mass of 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 , and a mass density of a few thousand m@xmath8 pc@xmath9 ( figer et al .",
    "1999a ) .",

    "the classic theory of panagia & felli ( 1975 ) and wright & barlow ( 1975 ) predicts that in the radio regime , the spectrum of wind emission is proportional to @xmath10 for a spherically symmetric , isothermal , stationary wind expanding at a constant velocity .",

    "in addition , a possible detection of he92@xmath0 was made , with a helium to hydrogen abundance , y@xmath20=146% .",
    "the continuum emission from the pistol nebula suggests an h ii mass of 11 m@xmath8 .",
    "the absence of molecular material associated with the pistol nebula , coupled with the low value of t@xmath17 compared to other galactic center h ii regions , suggest that this nebula may in fact be the ejecta from a previous stage of the pistol star s evolution ( figer et al . 1995 ; 1998 ) .",
    "the source of ionization of the pistol nebula is primarily due to the radiation field from several of the quintuplet cluster members ( figer et al .",

    "the crosses in figure 1 show three _",
    "hst_/nicmos sources ( q15 , q10 , and the pistol star ) which are likely associated with the radio point sources qr4 , qr5 , and the pistol star .",
    "the angular offsets in the radio / near - ir positions are @xmath21 3@xmath15 ; the error in the alignment is dominated by the uncertainty in the near - ir positions of @xmath15=05 .",
    "figure 2 shows the overlay between the _",
    "hst_/nicmos image and the 8.3 ghz continuum image ( shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "it is also apparent in figure 2 that three of the radio sources ( qr4 , qr5 and pistol star source ) are coincident with _ hst_/nicmos sources , and that three of the radio sources ( qr1 , qr2 and qr3 ) do not have _ hst_/nicmos counterparts . given the relatively large surface density of stars in the _",
    "hst_/nicmos image of the quintuplet cluster , the possibility of a chance superposition between a radio source and any _",
    "hst_/nicmos source is not negligible .",
    "however , the probability is much smaller that a randomly placed radio source with a flux density @xmath22 1 mjy ( 5 @xmath15 ) is coincident with a near - ir source that has been classified as a hot , massive star with a high mass - loss rate ( 16 sources total in a 77  @xmath12 74  region of the _ hst_/nicmos image ; c.f .",
    "figer et al .",
    "1999b ) . excluding the pistol star as a special case , we calculate that the combined probability that 2 out of 5 radio sources would be randomly aligned ( within the 3@xmath15 positional uncertainty of 15 ) with one of the 16 near - ir supergiants is 4 @xmath12 10@xmath23 .",
    "therefore , it is highly unlikely that these coincidences are due to chance superposition , and indeed represent real associations .",
    "the near - ir counterparts of qr4 and qr5 have been classified as hot , massive stars with high mass - loss rates : q15 has been classified as an ob i supergiant and q10 as wn9/ofpe , according to figer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "the radio point sources qr4 and qr5 are presumably detections of the stellar winds arising from the near - ir stars , since their spectra are consistent with @xmath24@xmath25 and they have near - ir counterparts .",
    "in addition , based on the classic theory of wright & barlow ( 1975 ) and panagia & felli ( 1975 ) , it is possible to predict the radio flux density of the stellar wind arising from an ob supergiant found in the quintuplet cluster at 3.6 cm . assuming the following wind parameters ( near the extreme values ) for an ob supergiant at the galactic center",
    " a maximum mass loss rate of @xmath26=10@xmath27 m@xmath8 yr@xmath14 , an electron temperature of t@xmath17=25,000 k , a terminal wind velocity of v@xmath28=500 , and a distance of 8.0 kpc ; the predicted radio flux density at 3.6 cm is 4 mjy . at this frequency , qr1@xmath4qr5 have flux densities in the range of 2@xmath46 mjy , consistent with this prediction . given the rms noise in our images of 0.2 mjy , we are capable of detecting emission from the winds of ob supergiants in the region of the quintuplet cluster , and the radio sources are most likely detections of these ionized winds . since there are at least 8 wolf - rayet type stars in the quintuplet cluster , we can also estimate the radio flux density at 3.6 cm for these stars , using the following wind parameters : m=5 @xmath12 10@xmath23 m@xmath8 yr@xmath14 , t@xmath17=40,000 k , v@xmath29=2000 , and d=8.0 kpc ; the predicted flux density for a wolf - rayet star at the galactic center is 0.05 mjy at 3.6 cm . since the rms noise in both of the vla continuum maps is 0.2 mjy , we would clearly not have detected the mass - losing wolf - rayet stars in the current data , and are only sensitive to the winds arising from ob supergiants .",
    "although the sources qr1 , qr2 , and qr3 are detected with s / n @xmath22 5 , and have spectral indices consistent with stellar wind sources , they have no obvious _ hst_/nicmos stellar counterparts .",
    "a possible explanation is that the near - ir extinction varies across the cluster , and that the stellar counterparts of qr1 , qr2 and qr3 are masked by greater extinction than the stellar counterparts of qr4 and qr5 . if we invoke extinction to explain the lack of counterparts for qr1@xmath4qr3 , then a near - ir extinction a@xmath30 @xmath22 8 is required , corresponding to a visual extinction a@xmath31 @xmath22 80 .",
    "this kind of extinction is only possible if a dense molecular cloud is located in front of part of the quintuplet cluster . in that case",
    ", the unseen counterparts could still be members of the cluster . however , there is no evidence for such a molecular cloud in this region , which makes this suggestion unlikely .",
    "the spectral index of the pistol star ( @xmath0  =  @xmath40.40.2 ) is consistent with a flat or slightly falling spectrum .",
    "it does not follow the classic theory for a fully ionized wind , which predicts a rising spectrum , @xmath0  =  + 0.6 . the pistol star , a prominent source in the near - ir _ hst_/nicmos image , has been classified as a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) by figer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and has a stellar wind .",
    "based on the stellar parameters for the pistol star ( c.f .",
    ", figer et al . 1998 , the `` l '' model ) , m=3.8 @xmath12 10@xmath23 m@xmath8 yr@xmath14 , t@xmath17=12,000 k , v@xmath28=100 , and a distance of 8.0 kpc , the predicted radio flux density at 3.6 cm is 9 mjy using the formulation of panagia & felli ( 1973 ) and wright & barlow ( 1975 ) . at 3.6 cm ,",
    "the flux density of the pistol star is 5.81.0 mjy , and at 6 cm the flux density is 7.41.0 mjy .",
    "the radio emission of the pistol star source is likely a detection of the ionized wind arising from the pistol star .",
    "one possible explanation for the slightly falling spectrum is that the pistol star may have a non - thermal component in its wind over the cm - wavelength range .",
    "this type of spectral index has been observed from other supermassive stars , with @xmath0 in the range of @xmath0=@xmath40.8 to 0.0 ( abbott et al .",
    "1984 ; persi et al .",
    "in fact , the vla survey of of galactic ob stars made by bieging et al .",
    "( 1989 ) finds that 24% of luminous supergiants are observed to have non - thermal spectra .",
    "this fraction is consistent with our results : 1 of the 6 radio point sources we detect has a slightly falling spectral index .",
    "non - thermal emission is thought to arise either by means of shocks in the wind itself , in the shock between the stellar wind and a binary companion ( contreras et al .",
    "1996 ) , or from the interaction of the stellar wind with the remnant of a star s previous evolutionary mass - loss phase ( leitherer et al . 1997 ) .",
    "six point sources were detected at 3.6 cm and 6 cm with the vla in the vicinity of the quintuplet cluster .",
    "these sources have rising spectra in the range of @xmath0=+0.5 to + 0.8 , with the exception of the pistol star ( @xmath0=@xmath40.4 ) .",
    "based on the overlay of the _ hst_/nicmos and 8.3 ghz vla continuum images , three of these radio sources , including the pistol star source , can be identified with hot , massive stars with high - mass loss rates .",
    "therefore , the radio sources are most likely detections of the ionized stellar winds emanating from the supermassive stars in the quintuplet cluster",
