    "the origin of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) is still not well understood to the level that we can predict them in advance , although considerable progress has been made in recent years in observations and numerical models ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . )",
    "one of the associated phenomena is the solar flare .",
    "the solar flare is characterized by a sudden increase in electromagnetic radiation , as a result of heating and particle acceleration , which are usually thought to result from magnetic reconnection .",
    "one problem appears to be the lack of consensus as to the role of magnetic reconnection in cmes , which eject coronal magnetized plasma into the heliosphere .",
    "intense flares are often observed around the times of extremely energetic cmes , such as several of those during the october ",
    "november 2003 period ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , less than half of cmes are associated with flares @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been reported that certain cmes , typically during solar minimum , may leave no observable signatures in the corona @xcite , not to mention flares .",
    "nevertheless , a flare - associated cme tends to show a characteristic kinematic pattern : that is , starting fast and then decelerating @xcite .    the association of flares with cmes increases with their peak soft x - ray flux . by definition",
    ", a cme is observed with white - light coronagraphs .",
    "their detection sensitivity is higher when the source region is located near the limb because of the way that thomson scattering works @xcite . according to @xcite , who carefully made associated cme - flare pairs during 19962001 ,",
    "the location - averaged cme association rate is roughly 20% , 50% and 90% for c - class , m - class , and x - class flares , respectively .",
    "when the two phenomena are associated , they tend to be closely related both temporally ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) and spatially ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this article , we study the association of flares with cmes during the extended minimum after solar cycle 23 , primarily using remote - sensing data from the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo : @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "flares were observed by the _ extreme - ultraviolet imager _",
    "( euvi : @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . to associate flares with cmes , we compare euvi with white - light data from the _ large angle spectroscopic coronagraph _ ( lasco : @xcite , @xcite ) on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) , and the cor-1 and cor-2 coronagraphs @xcite on stereo . the ambiguity in associating",
    "flares with cmes has been considerably reduced , thanks to the availability of high cadence cor-1 data that cover the corona between 1.4r@xmath8 and 4.0r@xmath8 in heliocentric distance , and also to the solar minimum conditions in which successive flares or cmes tend to occur farther apart in both time and space than when the solar activity is high . in the next section",
    ", we briefly review the solar minimum in question , and active regions and flares during the period . after describing the data used in this study , we present the analysis in section  3 . the results are given in section  4 with some discussion of selected examples . in section  5",
    "we summarize our study .",
    "following the last x - class flare on 14 december 2006 in solar cycle 23 , which occurred before the imagers on stereo started to be operational , not many eruptive events with intense x - ray emission were observed , as we show in section  4 .",
    "this situation apparently changed in february 2010 , when several cmes were observed in association with goes m - class flares . in order to give a glimpse of the last solar minimum , we show in figure  1 the daily euv flux from euvi 195    on stereo - ahead ( a ) .",
    "the average flux per pixel was processed using images taken around 12 ut .",
    "this plot also shows that , around february 2010 , the spatially - averaged euv flux resumed the level as of the beginning of 2007 .",
    "a catalog of flares observed by euvi was already published by @xcite .",
    "it contains a total of 185 flares up to 4 november 2008 that were either above the goes c1 level ( 1@xmath510@xmath6  w m@xmath7 in the 18    band ) or detected by the _",
    "reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _",
    "( rhessi : @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "its emphasis was on the properties of flares as observed in the euv wavelengths .",
    "however , the cme - flare association was not discussed except in a handful of rare events .",
    "although @xcite found a report of cme occurrence from lasco , cor1 , or cor2 around the times of about one third of the flares , such a report does not necessarily mean that the flare is associated with the cme , unless we make sure that the two phenomena occur close both in space and time . here",
    "we focus on the association of flares and cmes during the extended minimum after solar cycle 23 , by comparing euv and coronagraph images . as shown in section 4 , we find that a much smaller number of flares were associated with cmes than were indicated by @xcite .    during march 2007december 2009 , 11 m - class and",
    "95 c - class flares occurred .",
    "there were no x - class flares .",
    "as in @xcite , we study all of these m - class and c - class flares , and also some b - class and a - class flares . however , inclusion of the latter flares depends on whether they are associated either with a cme or cme - related signatures , rather than on their detection by rhessi .",

    "the mean speed and width of the cme are given in the sixth and seventh columns .",
    "most of them are taken from the cdaw cme catalog , and they are not corrected for the angle between the plane of the sky and the direction of the cme propagation expected for the location of the source region . the cme speed as observed in lasco - c2 and",
    "-c3 data should be taken as a lower limit , since the cme is often seen to decelerate already in this fov .",
    "it may be surprising that only 35 flares are included , and more so that a majority of them are b - class and less intense flares . m- and c - class flares are not as strongly associated with cmes found for solar cycle 23 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the association rate is much lower than the frequency of reports of cme occurrence that were shown by @xcite .",
    "in fact , table  3 includes only 13 of the 159 overlapping flares in @xcite , as indicated in the second column .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied statistically the properties of 95 impulsively accelerated cmes , mostly flare - associated , during the overlapping period ( january 2007may 2010 ) .",
    "it appears that many of them were from 2010 ( after the period that we deal with here ) , when the activity level resumed to be comparable to that of early 2007 .    despite the low association rate of flares with cmes , we note that all of the four fast ( @xmath12 900  km  s@xmath1 ) _ and _ wide ( @xmath2100@xmath3 ) cmes during the period of interest are associated with a flare that is at least identified in goes soft x - ray light curves . in the same period , there are a number of wide front - side cmes not associated with a flare , but they are never faster than 500  km  s@xmath1 .    table  3 would have been a little longer if we had included a few flares whose association with a cme is dubious .",
    "figure  8 shows an example .",
    "there was an a8 flare on 14 may 2007 , whose emission in euv was so weak that it was difficult to locate it in euvi intensity images .",
    "shortly after the flare , at 14:06  ut , lasco observed a cme at the heliocentric distance of 2.4r@xmath8 .",
    "although its linear speed was only 225  km  s@xmath1 , the cme was as wide as 72@xmath3 and the front was traceable to 17r@xmath8 . therefore , it is rank 5 in our scheme .",
    "however , using data from cor-1 on stereo - a , we do not believe that the a8 flare was associated with this cme , although we can not rule out the possibility .",
    "the main reason is that the front - like structure was already seen at @xmath132r@xmath8 in cor-1 data near the flare peak ( figure  8(a ) ) , suggesting the cme launch from a high altitude , generally not accessible to a minor flare .",
    "the flare region , ar  10956 , was already 10@xmath3 inside the east limb , but the two stereo spacecraft were separated by only 8@xmath3 at the time , and it was not clear if there was a large - scale structure behind the east limb that could have accounted for this cme .",
    "let us examine the flare - cme association in terms of the signatures in non - coronagraphic observations .",
    "see columns 811 of table  3 , which show ranks of the flares in terms of the respective observables as we introduced in section 3.2 .",
    "as expected , most of the cme - associated flares appear to be highly eruptive in the low corona .",
    "the 9th column shows that 32 of 35 ( 91% ) flares are rank iv ) , indicating a broad , loop - like eruption which looks unconstrained .",
    "note that this criterion comes from visual inspection of images and that it may be quite subjective .",
    "it is nevertheless straightforward to distinguish rank iv ) events from confined ( failed ) eruptions ( rank ii ) ) and jets ( rank iii ) ) .",
    "coronal dimming ( in the 8th column ) with ranking of iii ) or higher is seen in 26 ( 74% ) cme - associated flares .",
    "it is possible that our constraints may be too strong in terms of the depth of dimming ( @xmath010% less than the pre - flare intensity ) and the number of macro - pixels .",
    "note also that using the same number of pixels for the ranking of both disk and limb flares could be misleading because we do not know which part of the 3d coronal structure becomes dimmer due to mass evacuation in the cme processes .",
    "an euv wave is seen in a smaller number ( 20 ) of the cme - associated flares .",
    "this may be because not all cmes go through the phase of fast lateral expansion , which is proposed to be an essential ingredient of euv waves @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to compare table  3 with table  2 , where 21 of 34 ( 62% ) euv waves are shown to be associated with a clear cme .",
    "lastly , although 74% of the cme - associated flares show a type iii burst , the number is much less if we limit to a clear type iii burst that is observed at the highest frequency of _ wind_/waves ( 13.75  mhz ) and in the impulsive phase .",
    "flares not associated with a type iii burst tend to be more gradual , including those associated with a filament eruption .",
    "for example , the b3.0 flare is associated with a slow filament eruption .",
    "no clear type iii burst is observed , nor is an euv wave detected .",
    "therefore , it appears that a type iii burst may be characteristic of only a certain subset of cmes .",
    "finally we discuss active regions in terms of productivity of cme - associated flares .",
    "first , we point out that several cme - associated flares occurred in tiny active regions or in regions without sunspots ( therefore without noaa region numbers ) . according to table  3",
    ", as many as ten cme - associated flares occurred in ar  10956 .",
    "they are predominantly b - class flares and there was no m - class flare from this region ( table  1 ) .",
    "in contrast , flares in ar  10960 , including 10 m - class and 17 c - class flares , are hardly cme - associated .",
    "it is speculated that the co - existence of bipoles following and not following hale s law @xcite in ar  10956 may have made the difference in terms of productivity of cme - associated flares .",
    "this special configuration may be more important than the sunspot area , the @xmath14 parameter ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the mount wilson sunspot classification scheme as given in the sixth , seventh and eighth columns of table  1 .",
    "another factor that may affect whether the flare is associated with a cme may be its location with respect to the active region and global magnetic field .",
    "figure  9 compares the locations of flares in ar  10960 .",
    "most flares in ar  10960 are confined , and they occur close to the center of the region as encircled in red in figure  9(a ) .",
    "an exceptionally eruptive flare in ar  10960 is observed on the periphery ( encircled in cyan ) .",
    "this is consistent with earlier studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) indicating that the overlying and surrounding magnetic field is an important factor to determine if the flare is associated with a cme .",
    "moreover , the field is largely open around the location of the eruptive flare ( figure  9(b ) ) , indicating less strapping force .",
    "another example comes from late march 2008 , when three active regions ( ar  10987 , 10988 , and 10989 ) emerged around the same time in the same hemisphere and in a narrow longitude span of @xmath1360@xmath3 . in terms of the sunspot area and the @xmath14 parameter , ar  10988 was expected to be more active , but the two energetic cmes avoided it and occurred in the other regions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the presence of open field in ar  10987 and ar  10989 , and the lack thereof in ar  10988 , may be an important factor .",
    "the main objective of this article is to document the low association of flares with cmes during the solar minimum following cycle 23 .",
    "we have isolated a 34-month period that is not too close to the times of elevated activity in cycle 23 or 24 .",
    "we carefully compare euvi and coronagraph data during the period to associate each flare with a cme .",
    "such an analysis was not part of the euvi flare catalog compiled by @xcite , or the mission - long version recently generated by @xcite .",
    "it may be relatively straightforward to automate flare detection in high - cadence euv images .",
    "however , it is necessary to compare euv and white - light images carefully before finding pairs of associated flares and cmes .",
    "today this is still done manually .    here",
    "we define cmes as outflows that are not too narrow and are found beyond the heliocentric distance of 5r@xmath8 , in order to distinguish them from other processes such as waves and jets . in a way we follow the criticism of @xcite against the `` careless '' use of the term `` cme '' , which may give rise to unnecessary confusion when discussing solar eruptive phenomena .",
    "we have found only 35 cme - associated flares , 24 of which are b - class or less intense .",
    "this reminds us that a cme can be launched without strong magnetic reconnection responsible for intense flares , even though extremely energetic cmes tend to be associated with intense flares . some active region properties , such as the sunspot area ,",
    "the @xmath14 parameter , and complexity on the basis of the mount wilson sunspot classification scheme , may largely account for intense flares .",
    "however , cmes may be more intimately related to other properties , such as the co - existence of bipoles with different polarities , weaker overlying and surrounding field , and proximity to open field regions .",
    "@xcite discussed how to observe cmes without a coronagraph .",
    "the proposed cme signatures in euv images are often observed in the flares that we study , but none of them are observed in all of the cme - associated flares .",
    "we have not tested the association in the opposite direction , i.e. how well do they serve as sufficient conditions for cmes , except for the case of euv waves . for euv waves , 13 of 34 events ( 38% )",
    "are not associated with cmes .",
    "this indicates that euv waves may not be as tightly linked with cmes as often thought ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the recent work using aia data @xcite .",
    "the other three observables may also fail to be sufficient conditions for cmes .",
    "in particular , we often see type iii bursts not associated with a cme .",
    "therefore , we still can not rely on low coronal observations alone to detect and characterize cmes .",
    "different manifestations of cmes in the low corona suggest that there may be more than one mecahnism or a particular magnetic topology for launching cmes .",

    "<S> we study the association of solar flares with coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) during the deep , extended solar minimum of 20072009 , using extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and white - light ( coronagraph ) images from the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo ) . </S>",
    "<S> although all of the fast ( v @xmath0 900  km  s@xmath1 ) _ and _ wide ( @xmath2 100@xmath3 ) cmes are associated with a flare that is at least identified in goes soft x - ray light curves , a majority of flares with relatively high x - ray intensity for the deep solar minimum ( _ e.g. _ @xmath41@xmath510@xmath6  w m@xmath7 or c1 ) are not associated with cmes . </S>",
    "<S> intense flares tend to occur in active regions with strong and complex photospheric magnetic field , but the active regions that produce cme - associated flares tend to be small , including those that have no sunspots and therefore no noaa active - region numbers . </S>",
    "<S> other factors on scales comparable to and larger than active regions seem to exist that contribute to the association of flares with cmes . </S>",
    "<S> we find the possible low coronal signatures of cmes , namely eruptions , dimmings , euv waves , and type iii bursts , in 91% , 74% , 57% , and 74% , respectively , of the 35 flares that we associate with cmes . </S>",
    "<S> none of these observables can fully replace direct observations of cmes by coronagraphs . </S>"
