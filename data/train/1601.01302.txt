    "crooks theorem was originally derived in a classical setting @xcite ( for reviews on classical fluctuation theorems , see @xcite ) but there has accumulated a considerable body of quantum fluctuation relations ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the latter do often include measurements , and in particular energy measurements ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that typically destroy coherences and quantum correlations . here",
    "we avoid such auxiliary components , and obtain fluctuation relations that retain all quantum aspects of the evolution .",
    "the key is to explicitly model all degrees of freedom involved in the process .",
    "this includes the control mechanism that implements the change of the external parameter , i.e.  @xmath1 in @xmath0 , as well as the ` energy reservoir ' , e.g. , a battery or an excited atom , which donates the energy for the work @xmath2 .",
    "since work corresponds to a change of energy in this reservoir , it follows that the reservoir itself is forced to evolve as it fuels the dynamics .",
    "the general theme of this investigation is to formulate fluctuation relations in terms of this induced evolution . to make this more concrete ,",
    "let us briefly display the first of the fluctuation theorems that we will derive .",
    "the roles of the probability distributions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are here taken over by the channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 that are induced on the energy reservoir by the forward and reverse processes , respectively .",
    "as we shall see , these channels can , under suitable conditions , be related by the following quantum crooks relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the hamiltonian of the energy reservoir @xmath18 .",
    "the combined application of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , can be viewed as a counterpart to the term @xmath22 in ( [ standardcrooks ] ) .",
    "the mapping from @xmath15 to @xmath23 ( to be described in detail later ) is related to time - reversals , and can in some sense be regarded as a generalization of the transformation of @xmath24 to @xmath25 at the right hand side of ( [ standardcrooks ] ) .    in the following section we derive ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) and moreover",
    "show that it can be decomposed into diagonal and off - diagonal crooks relations , thus yielding fluctuation relations for coherences .",
    "we also derive quantum jarzynski equalities , as well as a bound on the average work cost . in section [ secmainenergytransl ]",
    "we regain the classical crooks relation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) from ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) via the additional assumption of energy translation invariance .",
    "we next turn to generalizations of ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) , where section [ mainconditional ] introduces conditional fluctuation relations , and section [ mainapproximate ] approximate versions .",
    "to derive the quantum crooks relation in ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) we employ a general class of models that previously has been used in the context of quantum thermodynamics to analyze , e.g. , work extraction , information erasure , and coherence @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that we include all the relevant degrees of freedom ( which in our case consist of four subsystems , see fig .",
    "[ figsystems ] ) and assign a global time - independent hamiltonian @xmath26 to account for energy . on this joint system",
    "we are allowed to act with any unitary operation @xmath27 that conserves energy , which is formalized by the condition that @xmath27 commutes with the total hamiltonian @xmath28 = 0 $ ] .",
    "( see @xcite for an alternative notion of energy conservation . )    at first sight it may be difficult to see how such a manifestly time - independent hamiltonian can be used to describe the evolving hamiltonians in crooks theorem . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a control system @xmath29 such that the hamiltonian of @xmath30 depends on the state of @xmath29 . as an illustration ,",
    "suppose that we wish to describe a transition from an initial hamiltonian @xmath31 to a final hamiltonian @xmath32 .",
    "one possibility would be to define a joint hamiltonian of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two normalized and orthogonal states of the control system @xmath29 . if the evolution would change the control from @xmath35 to @xmath34 , then this would effectively change the hamiltonian of @xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath32 .",
    "however , this change can in general not be achieved by an energy conserving unitary operation on @xmath38 alone , since the transition from @xmath31 to @xmath32 typically will involve a change of energy .",
    "the role of the energy reservoir @xmath18 is to make these transitions possible by donating or absorbing the necessary energy . with a suitable choice of hamiltonian @xmath17 of the energy reservoir ,",
    "the global hamiltonian @xmath39 allows for non - trivial energy conserving unitary operators @xmath27 .    in this investigation",
    "the energy reservoir does not only serve as a source or sink for energy , but also acts as a probe of the dynamics of the system . instead of using auxiliary measurements , which inevitably would introduce additional interactions that potentially may disturb the dynamics ,",
    "we here let the energy reservoir take over this role .",
    "we do , so to speak , make an additional use of a component that anyway has to be included .",
    "a further benefit of using an explicit quantum probe is that we not only capture the flow of energy , but also the change in coherence and correlations .",
    "needless to say , standard macroscopic energy reservoirs would be of little use for the latter purposes , due to the levels of decoherence that they are exposed to .",
    "however , our notion of energy reservoirs includes nano - systems like , e.g. , single atoms or spins .      in this section",
    "we derive a simplified version of our fluctuation theorem .",
    "this serves as a convenient intermediate step , and illustrates why time - reversal symmetry is useful .",
    "we wish to determine the channel induced on the energy reservoir by a non - equilibrium process _ a la _ crooks , where the system initially is in equilibrium , and is forced out of it .",
    "to model this we let the control system initially be in state @xmath35 , and we let the combined system and heat bath @xmath36 be in the gibbs state @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , we let the reservoir @xmath18 be in an arbitrary state @xmath42 .",

    "we should somehow relate this forward process with a ` reversed ' process , where the system instead is initiated in the gibbs state of the final hamiltonian , i.e. , the global system should be in the joint state @xmath45 .",
    "the question is how to formalize the idea of a reversed process acting on this initial state .",
    "a rather brutal interpretation would be to simply invert the entire global evolution , thus substituting @xmath27 with @xmath46 ( see fig .",

    "as the reader may have noticed , we have written @xmath55 and @xmath56 in ( [ preliminary ] ) rather than the more generally valid @xmath57 and @xmath58 . to obtain the former we can assume that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and thus @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "one may observe that the right hand side of ( [ preliminary ] ) is similar to crooks quantum operation time reversal @xcite ( not to be confused with the time reversals @xmath63 or the mapping @xmath64 discussed in the next section ) and closely related to petz recovery channel @xcite , where a relation to work extraction was identified recently @xcite .",
    "for further comments , see appendix [ secpetzrecovery ] .",
    "the approach of this investigation can be compared with another construction that also focuses on quantum channels @xcite , where the starting point is to assume a property of a channel ( unitality ) and derive fluctuation relations for the resulting probability distribution for suitable classes of initial and final measurements that sandwich the channel ( see also the generalization in @xcite ) .",
    "although ( [ preliminary ] ) indeed can be regarded as a kind of quantum crooks relation , it does suffer from an inherent flaw .",
    "the swap between @xmath27 and @xmath46 means that we invert the entire evolution of all involved systems , including the heat bath .",
    "apart from assuming an immense level of control , this assumption does not quite fit with the spirit of crooks relation .",
    "the latter only assumes a reversal of the time - schedule of the control parameters , not a reversal of the entire evolution . in the following",
    "we will resolve this issue by invoking time - reversal symmetry .      in standard textbooks on quantum mechanics",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) time - reversals are often introduced on the level of hilbert spaces via complex conjugation of wave - functions ( also applied in the context of quantum fluctuation relations , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "here we instead regard time - reversals as acting on operators ( cf .",
    "moreover , our time - reversals have the flavor of transpose operations rather than complex conjugations .",
    "since density operators and observables are hermitian , the choice between conjugation or transposition is largely a matter of taste .",
    "here we opt for the transpose , since this choice avoids the inconvenient anti - linearity of complex conjugation .",
    "a couple of key properties of our time - reversals @xmath63 are @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "( for the complete characterization , see appendix [ sectimereversal ] . )    to see why it is reasonable to refer to @xmath63 as a ` time - reversal ' , let us assume that the evolution operator @xmath27 is time - reversal invariant , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "if an initial state @xmath68 is evolved into @xmath69 , then the properties of @xmath63 mentioned above yield @xmath70 .",
    "in other words , the reversed final state state @xmath71 evolves to the reversed initial state @xmath72 .",
    "note that this ` backwards ' transformation is implemented by the forward evolution @xmath73 , rather than the inverted evolution @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath64-transformation that appears in ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) can be defined via the chosen time - reversal as @xmath75 as mentioned earlier , if @xmath76 , then the conjugate is given by @xmath77 . by the properties of @xmath63 mentioned above",
    "it thus follow that @xmath78 , i.e. , we time - reverse the operators in the kraus representation .    in the finite - dimensional case",
    "each time - reversal can be implemented by a transpose with respect to some orthonormal basis , followed by a special class of unitary operations .",
    "( hence , our time - reversals do strictly speaking include a bit larger set of operations than proper transposes , see appendix [ sectimereversal ] . ) since the transpose is a positive but not completely positive map ( as is illustrated by the effect of the partial transpose on entangled states @xcite ) we can conclude that time - reversals generally are not physical operations .",
    "hence , one should not be tempted to think of time - reversals as something that we actually apply to a system .",
    "however , given a _",
    "description _ of a state @xmath79 , there is nothing that in principle prevents us from preparing the time reversed state @xmath80 , which is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "similar to our intermediate version in section [ mainsecinterm ] we here assume a non - interacting global hamiltonian @xmath81 , and a global energy conserving unitary evolution @xmath82=0 $ ] . as a substitute for the global inversion of the evolution",
    "we assume time - reversal symmetry in terms of a suitably chosen time - reversal of the the form @xmath83 , i.e. , the global time reversal is composed of local reversals on @xmath38 and on @xmath18 .",
    "we impose the time reversal symmetry by assuming that @xmath67 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "another novel component compared to the intermediate version is that we associate _ pairs _ of control states to the hamiltonians on @xmath36 .",
    "we assign the pair @xmath86 , @xmath87 for the initial hamiltonian @xmath31 , and the pair @xmath88 , @xmath89 for the final hamiltonian @xmath32 .",
    "the general idea is that the members of these pairs correspond to the forward and reverse evolution of the control system .",
    "one way to formalize this notion is via the following relations @xmath90 hence , the time - reversal swaps the two control states into each other",
    ". note that if @xmath27 transforms @xmath86 to @xmath88 perfectly , then @xmath27 also transforms @xmath89 to @xmath87 perfectly . in the latter case one should keep in mind the reverse ordering of @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "; the state @xmath89 is the initial control state of the reverse process ( see fig .",
    "[ figtimereversal ] ) .",
    "let us assume that the unitary operator @xmath27 and the initial and final control states @xmath93 satisfy the conditions of the intermediate fluctuation relation .",
    "the channels @xmath14 and @xmath94 , obtained by substituting @xmath35 with @xmath86 , and @xmath34 with @xmath88 in equations ( [ nsdlkvn ] ) and ( [ sfldkbn ] ) , respectively , are according to ( [ preliminary ] ) related by @xmath95 for the reverse process we obtain the channels @xmath15 and @xmath96 , where @xmath35 this time is substituted by @xmath89 , and @xmath34 with @xmath87 . by using the the properties of the time - reversal one can show ( for details , see appendix [ secaquantumflctnthrm ] ) that @xmath97 . by applying this equality to ( [ lvnlnfnf ] ) our desired quantum crooks relation ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) follows immediately .",
    "note that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the ` forward ' evolution , i.e.  we no longer need to impose a global inversion of the dynamics .    after having established ( [ quantumcrooks ] )",
    "an immediate question is how to interpret it physically .",
    "the classical crooks relation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) can be phrased as a comparison between two experiments , one for the forward path of control parameters , and one for the reversed . for each of these two setups we repeat the experiment in order to obtain good statistical estimates of the probability distributions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the claim , so to speak , of crooks theorem is that these two probability distributions are related as in ( [ standardcrooks ] ) . our quantum fluctuation relation in ( [ quantumcrooks ] )",
    "can be interpreted in a similar manner .",
    "here the channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 induced by the forward and reverse process can in principle be determined by process tomography ( see e.g.  @xcite and sec .",
    "8.4.2 in @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "analogous to the classical crooks relation , our quantum fluctuation theorem tells us that these two channels should be related as in ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) .",
    "one may note that the mapping @xmath98 in this setup is something that we _ calculate _ given an experimental estimate of the channel @xmath15 , analogous to how we would calculate the function @xmath99 from the estimated distribution @xmath24 . in section [ mainsecglobal ]",
    "we consider a reformulation of ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) that is associated with a scenario that does not require such a post - processing .",
    "as the reader may have noticed , our quantum crooks relation ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) does , in contrast to the classical crooks relation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) , not contain any explicit reference to ` work ' .",
    "hence , we do in essence circumvent the issue of how to translate the classical notion of work into the quantum setting ; a question that has been discussed rather extensively in relation to fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "we can nevertheless in some sense associate work with the loss of energy in the reservoir , which we employ in section [ secmainenergytransl ] where we regain the classical crooks relation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) .      here",
    "we take a closer look at the nature of the induced channels @xmath100 and on the structure of the quantum crooks relation ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) .",
    "the energy conservation and the diagonal initial state with respect to the hamiltonian of @xmath101 conspire to decouple the dynamics on @xmath18 with respect to the ` modes of coherence ' @xcite ( which in turn is a part of the wider context of symmetry preserving operations @xcite ) . to make this more concrete ,",
    "assume that @xmath17 has a complete set of energy eigenstates @xmath102 with corresponding non - degenerate energies @xmath103 .",
    "let us also assume that @xmath104 acts as the transposition with respect to this energy eigenbasis .",
    "the decoupling does in this case mean that the channels @xmath100 can map an element @xmath105 to @xmath106 only if @xmath107 ( see appendix [ secdiagonalandoffdiagonal ] for further details ) .",
    "hence , each mode of coherence is characterized by an ` offset ' @xmath108 from the main diagonal ( see fig .",
    "[ figdiagonaloffdiagonal ] ) .",
    "in particular , the main diagonal is given by the offset @xmath109 .",
    "the dynamics of the diagonal elements under the forward process can be described via a conditional probability distribution @xmath110 the application of ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) yields @xmath111 which thus can be regarded as a diagonal crooks relation . in section [ secmainenergytransl ] we shall see how this in turn can be used to re - derive ( [ standardcrooks ] ) via the additional assumption of energy translation invariance .    for each permissible value of @xmath112 ( which depend on the spectrum of @xmath17 ) we can characterize the dynamics of the corresponding off - diagonal mode by @xmath113 where the assumption of non - degeneracy implies that @xmath114 is uniquely determined by @xmath115 , and similarly @xmath116 by @xmath117 .",
    "we obtain an off - diagonal analogue of ( [ diagonalcrooks ] ) in the form of @xmath118 in other words , the functional form of the relations for the main diagonal and all the off - diagonals are identical .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the numbers @xmath119 in general are complex , and thus can not be interpreted as conditional probability distributions .",
    "the conditional distributions @xmath120 and all @xmath119 can be regarded as representing different aspects of the channels @xmath100 .",
    "however , one can also give more direct physical interpretations to these quantities .",
    "to this end one should keep in mind that the energy reservoir can be viewed as being part of our experimental equipment , and we thus in principle are free to prepare and measure the reservoir it in any way that we wish . the conditional distribution @xmath120 can be interpreted as the probability to measure the energy @xmath121 in the reservoir after the the experiment has been completed , given that we prepared the reservoir in energy @xmath103 before we connected it to the system .",
    "equivalently , we could replace the initial preparation with an energy measurement , thus approaching the ` two - time ' or ` two - point ' measurements that play a central role in several investigations on quantum fluctuation relations ( see e.g. @xcite , and for overviews see @xcite ) , although we here apply these measurements to the energy reservoir , rather than on the system .",
    "an obvious issue with sequential measurements is that the first measurement typically perturbs the statistics of the second measurement .",
    "however , in our case the decoupling comes to our aid .",
    "if we measure the energy in the reservoir after the process , then the statistics of this measurement is not affected if we would insert an additional energy measurement before the process , irrespective of how off - diagonal the initial state may be .",
    "the decoupling thus justifies the use of a two - point measurement on the energy reservoir , if our purpose is to determine @xmath122 .",
    "however , the very same argument also implies that if we wish to determine @xmath123 we have to use non - diagonal initial states , as well as non - diagonal measurements .",
    "for an example of such a setup , see appendix [ secoffdiagonal ] .      from the classical crooks relation",
    "one can directly derive the jarzynski equality @xmath124 @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", it is not clear how to translate the random variable @xmath125 into the quantum setting , and consequently it is also not evident how to translate the expectation value @xmath126 ( which yields a variety of approaches to the quantum jarzynski equality , see overviews in @xcite ) . like for the crooks relation , we do not attempt a direct translation , but rather focus on the general dynamics in the energy reservoir .    by applying ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) to an initial state @xmath42 of the reservoir and take the expectation value of the operator @xmath127 , it follows that @xmath128}{{{\\mathrm{tr}}}[e^{\\beta h_e/2}\\mathcal{r}_{+}(\\hat{1 } ) e^{\\beta h_e/2}\\sigma ] }   =   \\frac{z(h^f_{s})}{z(h^i_{s } ) } .\\ ] ] although this equality has the flavor of a jarzynski equality , we can bring it one step further by additionally assuming that @xmath129 , or equivalently @xmath130 , i.e. , that these channels are unital .",

    "assume that @xmath17 has a point spectrum , then equation ( [ eq2jarzynski1 ] ) takes the form @xmath134 , where we have made use of the decoupling of the diagonal mode of coherence .",
    "this can alternatively be obtained directly from the diagonal crooks relation ( [ diagonalcrooks ] ) , where the unitality of @xmath15 implies that @xmath135 is not only stochastic , but doubly stochastic .      as mentioned above",
    ", the classical jarzynski equality follows directly from crooks relation .",
    "it is therefore perhaps a bit surprising that the condition of unitality of the channel @xmath94 emerges in the derivations of our jarzynski equalities . to explore this further ,",
    "let us consider the expected work cost of these processes .",
    "for a process that starts in equilibrium we would expect ( e.g as a special case of more general bounds on work costs @xcite ) that the average work cost should satisfy the bound @xmath136 , i.e. , the work cost is at least equal to the difference in ( equilibrium ) free energy between the final and initial hamiltonian ( where equality typically is reached in the limit of quasi - static processes ) . in the classical case ,",
    "this bound follows from jarzynski s equality by using the convexity of the exponential function @xcite .    in our",
    "setting one can use the diagonal crooks relation ( [ diagonalcrooks ] ) to show that @xmath137 ( as a technical remark , we do for this derivation additionally assume that @xmath17 has a pure non - degenerate point spectrum .",
    "for details see appendix [ secboundsonwork ] . )",
    "if we identify the decrease in average energy of the reservoir , @xmath138 with the average work cost @xmath139 , we thus regain the standard bound if @xmath94 is unital .",
    "hence , the unitality of @xmath94 appear again , this time to guarantee the standard work bound .",
    "the inequality ( [ zthetzj ] ) does not necessarily mean that the standard bound is violated .",
    "however , one can construct an explicit example where the work cost is smaller than the standard bound for a process with a non - unital @xmath94 ( see appendix [ secviolationstndrdworkb ] ) . at first this",
    "may seem a bit alarming since it would appear to suggest violations of basic thermodynamics .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that we here include the energy reservoir as a physical system , and that we can not expect to regain standard bounds if we allow ourselves to use the energy reservoir _ per se _ as a resource ( cf .",
    "discussions in @xcite ) , and one may suspect that the unitality of @xmath94 is related to this issue .",
    "a further indication in this direction is that the energy translation invariance , which is the topic of the next section , not only allows us to re - derive the classical crooks relation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) , but also guarantees that the channel @xmath94 is unital ( see appendix [ secenergyindependence ] ) .",
    "let us for a moment reconsider the classical crooks relation in equation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) .",
    "as formulated , it makes no explicit reference to any energy reservoir .",
    "moreover , the distributions @xmath140 are typically phrased as functions only of the work @xmath2 , and thus only functions of the _ change _ of energy in the implicit reservoir ( although it is difficult to see that anything in principle would prevent @xmath140 from depending on additional parameters , like the actual energy level of the reservoir ) .",
    "one could even argue that for a well designed experiment @xmath140 should not depend on how much energy there is in the reservoir ( as long as there is enough ) , since this in some sense is a property of the experimental equipment rather than a property of the system under study .",
    "this is in contrast with our more general formulation in terms of channels on the reservoir , which very explicitly allows for the possibility that the exact choice of initial state of the reservoir ( and thus the energy ) can make a difference . in order to formalize the idea that the experiment should be independent of the amount of energy in the reservoir ,",
    "we do in this section assume energy translation invariance .",
    "this enables us to derive the classical crooks relation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) from the quantum relation ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) .",
    "the technique for implementing energy translation invariance has previously been used to study work extraction and coherence @xcite .",
    "here we use a model where the spectrum of @xmath17 forms an equi - spaced doubly infinite energy ladder @xcite ( see also the continuum version in @xcite ) , i.e. , the energy eigenstates @xmath141 correspond to energies @xmath142 for some fixed number @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "we impose the energy translation invariance by assuming that the unitary operators @xmath27 should commute with energy translations along the energy - ladder , @xmath145 = 0 $ ] , where @xmath146 .",
    "( technically , we also assume that the eigenvalues of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are multiples of @xmath147 . ) as a consequence , the channels @xmath100 also become energy - translation invariant in the sense that @xmath148 for all @xmath149 ( see appendix [ secenergyindependence ] ) .",
    "a consequence is that the diagonal transition probabilities @xmath122 , defined in ( [ diagonalconditional ] ) , inherit the translation invariance @xmath150 moreover , the translation invariance ( [ channeltranslinv ] ) conspires with the decoupling of the diagonals decribed in section [ mainsecdiagonaloffdiagonal ] such that we can rewrite @xmath100 as @xmath151 hence , the channels @xmath100 are completely determined by the transition probabilities @xmath152 from @xmath153 to the other energy eigenstates .",
    "alternatively , one may say that the dynamics is identical along all of the diagonals ( which does _ not _ imply that the collection of diagonals of the density matrix are identical ) .",
    "our primary goal in this section is to regain ( [ standardcrooks ] ) from ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) .",
    "however , we face an immediate obstacle in that ( [ standardcrooks ] ) very explicitly refers to ` work ' , while we in our constructions deliberately have avoided to specify what the quantum version of work exactly is supposed to be",
    ". a way to test crooks theorem in a macroscopic setting would be to measure the energy content in the energy source before and after the experiment , in order to see how much energy that has been spent .",
    "this macroscopic type of two - point measurements makes sense since we can expect a macroscopic source to be in states that would not be significantly disturbed by energy measurements ( e.g.  in the sense of pointer states and quantum darwinism @xcite ) .",
    "recalling the discussion in section [ mainsecdiagonaloffdiagonal ] , the decoupling of the diagonal and off - diagonal modes of coherence can be regarded as yielding a weaker form of stability . in this case",
    "all coherences are blatantly annihilated , but the evolution of the diagonal distribution is unaffected by repeated energy measurements . since our aim is to regain the classical crooks relation , this appears as an acceptable form of stability , and it also seems reasonable to identify work with the energy loss in the reservoir , @xmath154 , for the initial measurement outcome @xmath103 and the final outcome @xmath121 .",
    "for these two - point measurements , the probability @xmath155 is obtained by summing over all possible transitions that result in the work @xmath2 for the given initial state @xmath42 , and thus @xmath156 to be able to treat the energy reservoir as an implicit object , as it is in the standard classical case , the distributions @xmath140 should not be functions of the initial state @xmath42 . here , the energy translation invariance comes into play . by combining ( [ weeqwre ] ) with ( [ nvfleqlv ] )",
    "we find that @xmath157 , which thus removes the dependence on the reservoir . in the final step",
    "we combine the last equality with the diagonal crooks relation ( [ diagonalcrooks ] ) and obtain the classical crooks relation ( [ standardcrooks ] ) .",
    "there are several reasons for why it is useful to generalize the type of quantum fluctuation theorems that we have considered so far .",
    "first of all , the fluctuation relation ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) and its accompanying setup is in many ways an idealization .",
    "for example , the requirement of perfect control together with energy conservation is a strong assumption that easily leads to an energy reservoir that has to have an energy spectrum that is unbounded from both above and below ( see appendix [ secconditionsone ] ) and a bottomless spectrum is certainly not very reasonable from a physical point of view .",
    "a further consequence of the idealization , which may not be apparent unless one dives into the technicalities in the appendices , is that ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) is based on rather elaborate assumptions . apart from resolving these issues , the conditional fluctuation theorems naturally incorporate non - equilibrium initial states .",
    "( there exist previous generalizations to non - canonical initial states .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for a classical case , and @xcite for the quantum case . )    to see how the conditional fluctuation relations can come about , let us again consider the perfect control mechanism , i.e. , that the evolution transforms the initial control state into the final with certainty .",
    "imagine now that we abandon this assumption , and instead include a measurement that checks whether the control system succeeds to reach the final control state or not .",
    "the idea is that we only accept the particular run of the experiment if the control measurement is successful .",
    "analogous to our previous fluctuation relations , the conditional fluctuation theorem relates the induced dynamics of the forward and reverse processes , but which now are conditioned on successful control measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ figconditional ] ) .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind that one should be cautious when interpreting post - selected dynamics , as it easily can end up in seemingly spectacular results .",
    "the conditional dynamics can for example create states with off - diagonal elements from globally diagonal states ( see appendix [ exampletwoqubits ] for an explicit example ) .",
    "however , this should not viewed as a mysterious creation of coherence , but simply as the result of a post selection with respect to a non - diagonal measurement operator .    in the introduction",
    "it was pointed out that an advantage with fluctuation theorem ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) is that it does not rely on any auxiliary measurements .",
    "it may thus appear a bit contradictory that we here re - introduce measurements as a fundamental component in the formalism .",
    "however , these only serve as control measurements upon which we condition the quantum evolution in the energy reservoir .",
    "this is in contrast to approaches where the purpose of the measurements is to generate classical outcomes ( as for two - point energy measurements @xcite ) and where the quantum fluctuation relations are based on the resulting probability distributions , much in the spirit of classical fluctuation relations .    as a final general remark",
    "one should note that it turns out to be unnecessary to restrict the control measurements to the control system ; we can let them act on the joint system @xmath158 in any manner that we wish , resulting in a conditional evolution on @xmath18 .",
    "each control measurement has the two possible outcomes ` yes ' or ` no ' , and can be described via measurement operators @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the probability of a ` yes ' when measured on a state @xmath79 .",
    "similarly @xmath161 $ ] is the probability of the outcome ` no ' . in other words , @xmath162 is a binary positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xcite .",
    "these measurement operators do in our formalism serve a dual purpose ; not only describing control measurements , but also parameterizing initial states .",
    "the latter is done via what we here refer to as the ` gibbs map ' @xmath163 and the ` partition map ' @xmath164 defined by @xmath165 for finite - dimensional hilbert spaces all density operators can be reached via @xmath163 for suitable choices of @xmath166 .",
    "these mappings are generalizations of the gibbs state and the partition function in the sense that @xmath167 and @xmath168 .      as before , we assume a global non - interacting hamiltonian of the form @xmath169 we furthermore assume time - reversals @xmath170 and @xmath104 such that @xmath171 , and @xmath85 .",
    "we also assume that the global evolution preserves energy @xmath82 = 0 $ ] , and that it is time - reversal symmetric , @xmath67 , with respect to @xmath172 .",
    "the forward process is characterized by a pair of measurement operators on system @xmath173 , where @xmath174 defines the initial state via the gibbs mapping , and @xmath175 the measurement at the end of the process .",
    "( these measurement operators do not have to be related to energy measurements . )",
    "the global initial state @xmath176 evolves via an energy - preserving unitary operation @xmath27 , and we condition the result on a successful measurement of @xmath175 . the resulting completely positive map ( cpm ) on @xmath18",
    "is given by @xmath177v[\\mathcal{g}_{\\beta h_{\\widetilde{s}}}(q_{\\widetilde{s}}^{i+ } ) \\otimes \\sigma]v^{\\dagger}\\boldsymbol{)}.\\ ] ] that we generically get a cpm rather than a channel corresponds to the fact that the control measurement may fail .",
    "the quantity @xmath178 is the probability that the control measurement succeeds .    to obtain the reversed process",
    "we define the operators @xmath179 and @xmath180 , and use @xmath181 to generate the initial state , and @xmath182 to characterize the final measurement . in other words ,",
    "we not only time - reverse the measurement operators , but also swap their roles .",
    "the resulting cpm on @xmath18 for the reversed process thus becomes @xmath183v[\\mathcal{g}_{\\beta h_{\\widetilde{s}}}(q_{\\widetilde{s}}^{f-})\\otimes \\sigma]v^{\\dagger}\\boldsymbol{)}.\\ ] ]    with the above assumptions one can show ( see appendix [ secconditional ] ) that the cpms @xmath184 are related by the following ` conditional ' fluctuation theorem @xmath185 where we use the notation @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the conditional fluctuation relation ( [ conditionalfluctuationthm ] ) allows ( up to infinite - dimensional technicalities ) for arbitrary initial states on @xmath173 , and thus in particular arbitrary coherences .",
    "we only need to choose the appropriate initial measurement operator @xmath174 that generates the desired initial state via the gibbs map .    the quantum fluctuation relation in ( [ quantumcrooks ] )",
    "can be regained from ( [ conditionalfluctuationthm ] ) , and as a first step we choose the measurement operators to be @xmath188 and @xmath189 . for the appropriate hamiltonian @xmath190 , the gibbs map gives the conditional equilibrium states @xmath191 and @xmath192 . due to the additional assumption of perfect control ,",
    "the evolution @xmath27 is such that we can replace the final measurement operators with identity operators , i.e. , we do not have to perform any measurements at the end of the processes .",
    "this sketchy re - derivation indicates that we can abolish the assumption of perfect control if we instead keep the measurements at the end of the protocol .",
    "hence , these control measurements may fail , e.g. , if the energy reservoir does not contain sufficient energy , which thus allows us to avoid an energy spectrum that is unbounded from below .",
    "( for an explicit example , see appendix [ abolishperfectcontrol ] . )    as opposed to ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) there is for ( [ conditionalfluctuationthm ] ) in general no decomposition into different off - diagonal crooks relations .",
    "however , in the special case that the measurement operators @xmath174 and @xmath175 are diagonal with respect to an eigenbasis of @xmath190 one can obtain ( see appendix [ secdiagonalmeasuremnts ] ) diagonal conditional versions . in particular , one can impose the energy translation invariance and obtain ( appendix [ secdiagonalmeasuremnts ] ) a conditional version of the classical crooks relation .",
    "so far we have formulated our fluctuation relations solely in terms of channels and cpms induced on the energy reservoir .",
    "here we consider a reformulation that highlights two elementary properties on which our fluctuation relations in some sense are based .    given some channel or cpm @xmath49 , a pair of measurement operators @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and a hamiltonian @xmath26 , we define the ` transition probability ' from @xmath193 to @xmath194 by @xmath195= { { \\mathrm{tr}}}\\big(q^f\\mathcal{f}\\big(\\mathcal{g}_{\\beta h}(q^{i})\\big)\\big).\\ ] ] hence , @xmath196 $ ] is the probability that we would detect @xmath193 after we have evolved the initial state @xmath197 under the map @xmath49 .",
    "the gibbs map thus again appears as a method to parametrize the set of initial states .",
    "the quantum crooks relation ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) can be rephrased in terms of these transition probabilities as @xmath198 \\\\ & = z(h^f_{s})\\mathcal{z}_{\\beta h_e}(q^{f}_e)p^{\\mathcal{f}_{-}}_{\\beta h}[q^{i-}_e\\rightarrow q^{f-}_e ] ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 are measurement operators on the energy reservoir ( not on @xmath173 ) , and where , as one may expect , @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "in section [ derivingquantumcrooks ] we noted the possibility to interpret the quantum crooks theorem ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) in terms of process tomography of the two induced channels @xmath100 . in that interpretation",
    "the mapping @xmath202 is something that we implement ` by hand ' on the experimentally determined description of the channel @xmath15 .",
    "the reformulation ( [ reformulationquantumcrooks ] ) suggests a different interpretation where the fluctuation relation can be tested more directly via the estimated transition probabilities .",
    "the mappings @xmath19 and @xmath64 are in some sense put in by hand also in this scenario , but they enter in the parametrization of the initial states and the measurement operators , rather than via a post processing of the measurement data .",
    "it is no coincidence that the measurement operators @xmath203 undergo the same transformations as the operators @xmath204 that we know from the conditional fluctuation relations .",
    "these similarities stem from the fact that all of our fluctuation relations can be regarded as special cases of a ` global ' fluctuation relation , defined for global measurement operators @xmath205 on the whole of @xmath206 .",
    "it is straightforward to confirm ( or to consult appendix [ secaltformtransprob ] ) that energy conservation @xmath28 = 0 $ ] combined with time reversal symmetry @xmath207 , @xmath67 , yields @xmath208 = \\mathcal{z}_{\\beta h}(q^{f})\\mathcal{p}^v_{\\beta h}[q^{f-}\\!\\rightarrow\\ ! q^{i-}],\\ ] ] where @xmath209 and @xmath210 .    the global relation ( [ mainglobal ] )",
    "can alternatively be phrased as the invariance of the quantity @xmath211 under the transformation @xmath212 .",
    "all our fluctuation relations do in some sense express this basic invariance in different guises .",
    "one can indeed re - derive ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) and ( [ conditionalfluctuationthm ] ) from ( [ mainglobal ] ) .",
    "however , when doing so one quickly realizes that this hinges on another property ( that we have used repeatedly without comments ) .",
    "namely , if the global hamiltonian @xmath26 is non - interacting over two subsystems , i.e. @xmath213 , then the mapping @xmath214 satisfies the factorization property @xmath215 although elementary , it is in some sense this property ( in conjunction with product time - reversals @xmath216 ) that makes it possible to formulate fluctuation relations solely in terms of the dynamics of the energy reservoir , and also to eliminate unaccessible degrees of freedom ( see appendix [ secaltformtransprob ] for further details ) .",
    "the central role of this property may become more apparent when we abandon it in section [ mainapproximate ] .    as a side - remark one can note that if one attempts to formulate quantum fluctuation relations for non - gibbsian generalizations of equilibrium distributions , then the lack of a factorization property for non - exponential functions makes the generalization problematic ( see appendix [ secgeneralizedgibbs ] ) .",
    "the conditional relations extend the notion of fluctuation theorems to non - equilibrium initials states on @xmath173 .",
    "an obvious question is if also entanglement and general pre - correlations can be included .",
    "( one could even argue that in order to deserve the label ` fully quantum ' our fluctuation relations must include quantum correlations . ) the global fluctuation relation ( [ mainglobal ] ) already provides an affirmative answer to this question , in the sense that we can generate arbitrary global initial states via suitable choices of measurement operators ( including quantum correlations to external reference systems ) . however , ( [ mainglobal ] ) is not the only option for how to describe such scenarios , and here we highlight three special cases that focus on descriptions via channels or cpms .",
    "imagine that the energy reservoir not only carries energy and coherences , but also carries entanglement and correlations with an external reference @xmath217 ( not included in @xmath206 ) .",
    "one option for obtaining a fluctuation relation that incorporates this scenario would be to regard @xmath218 as a new extended energy reservoir , with a hamiltonian @xmath219 and a new time - reversal @xmath220 , with @xmath221 . both the quantum fluctuation relation ( [ quantumcrooks ] ) and the conditional fluctuation relation ( [ conditionalfluctuationthm ] ) are applicable to this scenario . in the latter case , the induced cpms @xmath100 on the new energy reservoir @xmath218 satisfies the corresponding quantum crooks relation @xmath222 .      an obvious alternative to the energy reservoir carrying correlations with an external reference",
    "is that @xmath173 carries these correlations .",
    "we can analogously incorporate @xmath217 into @xmath173 , with the joint hamiltonian @xmath223 and an extended time - reversal @xmath224 such that @xmath225 .",
    "the requirements for the conditional fluctuation theorem ( [ conditionalfluctuationthm ] ) are satisfied for this extended system , thus resulting in the relation @xmath226 .",
    "the two previous examples can both be regarded as variations of the conditional fluctuation relation , and do in this sense not add anything essentially new to the general picture .",
    "a maybe more interesting case is if we allow for pre - correlations between @xmath173 and @xmath18 .",
    "( it is not difficult to imagine cases where the energy reservoir @xmath18 interacts repeatedly with @xmath173 , and thus may build up correlations . )",
    "apart from the global fluctuation relation ( [ mainglobal ] ) this case does not fit very well with our previous scenarios .",
    "however , it is straightforward to adapt our general formalism to find a fluctuation relation for the evolution on the joint system @xmath227 .    for the sake of illustration we consider one particular case related to the setup in section [ derivingquantumcrooks ] , but where we allow for initial correlations between @xmath228 and @xmath18 . in essence ( for details on the setup , see appendix [ secprecorrelations ] )",

    "for these channels one can derive the fluctuation relation @xmath232 the partition maps on the left and right hand side cancel due to the identical initial and final hamiltonian for a heat bath that starts in the gibbs state .",
    "note also that the two applications of the @xmath214-map may potentially involve an initial hamiltonian @xmath233 that is different from the final hamiltonian @xmath234 .",
    "the global hamiltonian @xmath26 has so far in this investigation only characterized the notion of energy conservation , while the dynamics has been modeled by a unitary operator @xmath27 , with the only restriction that @xmath26 and @xmath27 should commute . in view of standard textbook",
    "quantum mechanics it would be very reasonable to demand a much more tight connection , where the global hamiltonian @xmath26 induces the evolution according to schrdinger s equation , thus yielding @xmath235 .",
    "an additional benefit with the latter arrangement would be that it does not require any further interventions beyond the preparation of the initial state , the measurement of the final state , and the time - keeping for when to do the measurement ( which may require non - trivial resources ) .",
    "in other words , once we have started the global system it evolves autonomously .",
    "( for discussions on autonomous and clock controlled thermal machines in the quantum regime , see @xcite . )",
    "this should be compared with the models that we have employed so far , where one in principle should analyze the mechanism that implements the evolution @xmath27 .",
    "the problem is that if we would impose the condition @xmath235 for non - interacting hamiltonians as in ( [ structureglobalhamil ] ) , the resulting dynamics on the energy reservoir would become trivial .",
    "if we on the other hand would abandon the non - interacting hamiltonians , then we also have to abandon the factorization property ( [ mainfactorization ] ) , which , as pointed out in section [ mainsecglobal ] , plays an important role in our derivations . the main observation in this section",
    "is that we can obtain approximate fluctuation relations as long as the factorization holds approximately , which also is enough to obtain a non - trivial evolution . in the following section we shall illustrate the general ideas with two special cases .",
    "( for a more general version that includes both of them , see appendix [ secapproximatefluct ] . )",
    "there is an additional reason for why it is useful to go beyond our previous settings .",
    "namely that there exist rather evident ways to ` quantize ' the classical control mechanism in crooks relation that do not fit particularly well within the machinery that we have employed so far .",
    "these quantized control mechanisms moreover provide a good starting point for introducing approximate fluctuation relations .",

    "in some sense it is thus the kinetic operator @xmath244 that causes the failure of the factorization property . on the other hand , it is also the kinetic operator that yields a non - trivial evolution of the control mechanism .",
    "it is this tension that we strive to handle via the approximate fluctuation relations .",
    "the basic idea is that if the measurement operators @xmath245 and @xmath246 are well localized outside the interaction region , then the systems are approximately non - interacting , and consequently the factorization ( [ mainfactorization ] ) should hold approximately .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that even if the measurement operators are well localized in non - interacting regions , this does not exclude the possibility that the system evolves into states where the interactions are strong , even at the very moment of the control measurement .",
    "( for an explicit example , see fig .",

    "we have furthermore shown that the classical crooks relation can be regained under the additional assumption of energy translation invariant dynamics on the energy reservoir .",
    "the general approach moreover leads to the concept of conditional fluctuation relations , where a pair of measurement operators characterizes the initial state and the final measurement , and where the transformation from the forward to the reverse process corresponds to a transformation of the pair of measurement operators .",

    "hence , we do again obtain the effective reversal of the evolution .",
    "one can see that for the complex conjugation the reversal this is due to to the fact that the complex conjugation inverts the time evolution operator , while for the transpose it is due to the inversion of the operator ordering .      instead of directly defining time - reversals in terms of transposes we here",

    "can see that transposes satisfy these conditions , although the latter allow for a slightly larger class of operations ( see proposition [ tcharactfinite ] ) .",

    "we do in this investigation often assume that the heat bath initially is in the gibbs state corresponding to a given temperature .",
    "although not unusual assumption , e.g. , in derivations of master equations @xcite and @xcite ( in particular sections 3.6.2.1 and 4.2.2 ) , it is nevertheless worth considering the justification , especially since one may argue that it is not the heat bath _ per se _ that is gibbs distributed , but rather systems that are weakly coupled to it .",
    "one possible argument would be that the environment can be separated into a ` near environment ' that is relevant on the time scale of the experiment , and a ` far environment ' ( or ` super bath ' ) that puts the near environment in the gibbs state ( see e.g. the discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "another approach would be to assume that an ideal heat bath in some sense behaves _ as if _ it is gibbs distributed .",
