    "[ fig3 ] for the symmetric cm interaction , which reflects the behavior of magnetic sro . considering the heisenberg limit ,",
    "the increase of @xmath2 with temperature is caused by the decrease of af sro , i.e. , of the spin stiffness against the orientation along a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "since the sro is less pronounced at higher @xmath88 , @xmath2 reveals a maximum near the exchange energy and a crossover to the high - temperature curie - weiss behavior . in the paramagnetic phase for @xmath101 ,",
    "the susceptibilities @xmath102 are lowered as compared with the heisenberg limit due to the @xmath85-induced enhancement of af sro .",
    "moreover , the susceptibility @xmath103 is reduced as compared with @xmath104 , because the sro of the x- and y - spin components is more pronounced due to the af cm interaction along the x- and y - axes . in the lro phase",
    ", the susceptibility @xmath105 strongly decreases with decreasing @xmath88 , because the increasing easy - x - axis lro also enhances the sro . considering the susceptibility @xmath106 , with decreasing @xmath88 below @xmath1 the sro of the y - spin components",
    "is reduced due to the increasing alignment of the spins in x - direction , so that @xmath106 increases with decreasing @xmath88 .",
    "thus , @xmath106 exhibits a minimum at @xmath1 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath104 in the lro phase turns out to be nearly temperature independent .",
    "in this paper we have calculated thermodynamic properties of the 2d antiferromagnetic ch model within a generalized mean - field approach for arbitrary temperatures . our main focus was the detailed investigation of magnetic lro .",
    "we have found that the nel temperature @xmath1 is finite even in the case of a symmetric cm interaction .",
    "we have explained the temperature dependence of the uniform static susceptibility in terms of magnetic sro .",
    "our investigation forms the basis for forthcoming extended studies of the ch model .",
