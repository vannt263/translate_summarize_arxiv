    "recent years have witnessed steady progress in the lattice qcd calculation of the light hadron spectrum  @xcite . in the quenched approximation ignoring quark vacuum polarization effects , well - controlled chiral and continuum extrapolations enabled a calculation of hadron masses with an accuracy of 0.53%  @xcite .",
    "at the same time the study established a systematic deviation of the quenched light hadron spectrum from experiment by approximately 10% .",
    "we then have made an attempt of full qcd calculation that allows chiral and continuum extrapolations within a consistent set of simulations  @xcite .",
    "the deviations from experiment in the light hadron spectrum are significantly reduced and the light quark mass decreases by about 25% with the inclusion of dynamical @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks . with currently available computer power and simulation algorithms ,",
    "however , the sea quark mass that can be explored is far from the physical value and a long chiral extrapolation is involved to get to the physical @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark mass .",
    "an attempt has been made to push down the simulation to a small quark mass corresponding to @xmath10 in full qcd with the kogut - susskind(staggered)-type quark action  @xcite .",
    "the staggered action , however , poses a problem of flavor mixing , which would modify the hadron spectrum and its quark mass dependence near the chiral limit .",
    "the staggered action also suffers from ambiguities in hadron operators and has a potential problem of non - locality .",
    "the wilson - type quark actions have the advantage of simplicity : they are local and respect flavor symmetry , but a larger computational cost limits the simulations to relatively large quark masses corresponding to @xmath11  @xcite . an important problem is to examine whether chiral extrapolations from such a quark mass range lead to results viable in the chiral limit .",
    "chiral extrapolations are usually made with polynomials in the quark mass .",
    "the problem is that they are not consistent with the logarithmic singularity expected in the chiral limit . in reality , the physical quarks are not exactly massless and hence the polynomial extrapolation should in principle work .",
    "however , increasingly higher orders are needed should one wish to increase the accuracy of the extrapolation .",
    "it is compelling to estimate the systematic errors due to higher order contributions when the data are extrapolated using a low - order polynomial .",
    "an alternative choice for chiral extrapolations is to incorporate chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite .",
    "the present lattice data , however , are not quite consistent with the chpt predictions .",
    "the high - statistics jlqcd simulation of two - flavor full qcd , using the plaquette gauge action and the @xmath12-improved wilson quark action at @xmath13 ( @xmath14  fm ; the spatial size @xmath151.77  fm ) , shows no signature for the logarithmic singularity in the pion mass and pion decay constant  @xcite . a possible reason for the failure to find the chiral logarithm is that sea quark masses , corresponding to @xmath160.6 , are too large .",
    "higher order corrections of chpt may have to be included to describe the data , as suggested from a partially quenched analysis , which shows that @xmath170.3 is required for the convergence of one - loop formula  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is explicit chiral symmetry breaking of the wilson quark actions that may invalidate the chpt formulae .",
    "modifications due to finite lattice spacings may be needed for an analysis of data obtained on a coarse lattice .",
    "recently studies were made to adapt chpt to the wilson - type fermion at finite lattice spacings ( wchpt )  @xcite , with subtle differences in the order counting , and hence the resulting formulae for observables , among the authors .",
    "the work  @xcite assumes the @xmath12 chiral symmetry breaking effects being smaller than those from the quark mass , and only the effects linear in lattice spacing are retained in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "this contrasts to the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite who include the @xmath18 effects in the chiral lagrangian , however , with different order countings . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath12 terms are treated as being comparable to the quark mass term while the @xmath18 terms are assumed to be subleading : in this case , @xmath12 effects are essentially absorbed into the redefinition of the quark mass in the one - loop formulae and the @xmath18 terms provide additional counter terms . in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , the terms of @xmath18 are kept at the leading order , because the existence of parity - broken phase and vanishing of pion mass depend on them in a critical way  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of chiral logarithm terms receive @xmath12 contributions , and hence the logarithmic chiral behavior is modified at a finite lattice spacing .",
    "similar attempts to include the @xmath18 flavor mixing for the staggered - type quark action were made in refs .",
    "@xcite .    the qq+q collaboration  @xcite applied the one - loop chpt and wchpt with the prescription of refs .",
    "@xcite to their data obtained at @xmath190.5 .",
    "their simulations were made at coarse lattices of @xmath20  fm @xmath21 and @xmath22  fm @xmath23 using the plaquette gauge action and the unimproved wilson quark action ( @xmath24  fm ) .",
    "they reported that their data are described by these formulae .",
    "however , their sea quark masses are not quite small , and , since large scaling violation is suspected with unimproved actions at coarse lattice spacings and lattice artifacts are suggested at strong couplings  @xcite , it should be demonstrated at weaker couplings in order that the discretization effects are actually under control .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration reported a result at @xmath25 obtained with the actions and the lattice spacing the same as those of jlqcd , with @xmath26  fm  @xcite .",
    "they indicated the pion decay constant to bend slightly downward at this quark mass , but further work is required for quantitative comparison with the chpt predictions .    in this paper",
    ", we follow up on our previous two - flavor full qcd work  @xcite with an rg - improved gauge action and tadpole - improved @xmath12-improved wilson - clover quark action at @xmath270.55 and attempt to lower the quark mass to give @xmath28 down to 0.35 .",
    "since the computational costs grows rapidly toward the chiral limit , roughly proportional to @xmath29  @xcite , we concentrate our effort on the coarsest lattice of @xmath30  fm at @xmath1 , while using improved actions .",
    "generation of configurations below @xmath31 demands technical improvements .",
    "the bicgstab algorithm sometimes fails to converge , which we overcome by an improvement called bicgstab(ds-@xmath32 )  @xcite .",
    "another problem is the emergence of instabilities in the hmc molecular dynamics evolution  @xcite .",
    "this seems to be caused by very small eigenvalues of the dirac operator , leading to the change of the molecular dynamics orbit from elliptic to hyperbolic .",
    "the only resolution at present is to reduce the time step size . in this manner",
    ", we generated 4000 trajectories at @xmath33 , 0.5 and 0.4 and 1400 trajectories at the smallest quark mass of @xmath34 on a @xmath35 lattice with @xmath36  fm . to examine the finite - size effect",
    ", we also generated 2000 trajectories at @xmath33 and 0.5 on a @xmath37 lattice with @xmath38  fm .",
    "we calculate the light hadron spectrum and the quark mass on these configurations , and examine the validity of the quadratic chiral extrapolations by comparing the extrapolations made in the previous work with our new data at smaller quark masses .",
    "it turns out that the new data are increasingly lower than the extrapolation toward a smaller sea quark mass .",
    "we then examine how our data compare with the wchpt formulae , and whether wchpt fits using only the previous data at large quark masses predict correctly the new small quark mass data .",
    "this serves as a test to verify the viability of wchpt and of chiral extrapolations .",
    "computing for the present work was made on the vpp5000/80 at the information processing center of university of tsukuba .",
    "we used 4 or 8 nodes , each node having the peak speed of 9.6  gflops .",

    "the optimum value of @xmath32 depends on simulation parameters . to avoid a tuning of @xmath32 at each simulation point",

    "[ figure : comparison_of_iterations - all - rc - beta_1.80-kappa_0.14585 ] .",
