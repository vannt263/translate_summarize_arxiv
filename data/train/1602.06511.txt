    "in the history of quantum mechanics , researches on blackbody radiation and hydrogen atoms played important roles .",
    "it is probably cosmology and black holes that are expected to play similar roles towards our better understanding of gravity .",
    "black holes have properties similar to thermodynamics , known as black hole thermodynamics . because of the no - hair theorems , stationary black holes have only a small number of parameters while a non - gravitating system in thermodynamic equilibrium are also parametrized by a small number of macroscopic parameters . similarly to ordinary thermodynamics , the black hole thermodynamics has four laws  @xcite : the zeroth law states that the surface gravity @xmath0 of a stationary black hole is constant over the horizon ; the first law relates variation of the mass @xmath1 in the space of stationary black holes to that of the horizon area @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the newton s constant ; the second law states that the @xmath2 does not decrease ; and the third law states that @xmath0 can not become zero within finite affine time .    from the four laws of black hole thermodynamics",
    "it is expected that the horizon area @xmath2 or its increasing function plays the role of entropy in ordinary thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is the hawking s discovery  @xcite of thermal radiation from black holes that determined the precise form of the black hole entropy : by identifying the temperature of a black hole to be the temperature of hawking radiation , @xmath5 and the energy of the black hole to be @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the speed of light , one concludes from the first law that the entropy of the black hole should be given by @xmath8 up to addition of an arbitrary constant , which can be set to zero by demanding that @xmath9 vanish for @xmath10 .",
    "it is also the hawking radiation that invalidates the second law of black hole thermodynamics : a black hole may lose its mass due to the hawking radiation and thus the horizon area may decrease . taking into account the hawking radiation ,",
    "the generalized second law then states that the sum of the black hole entropy and the entropy of matter outside the black hole should not decrease .",
    "intriguingly , the formula ( [ eqn : s ] ) for the black hole entropy , known as bekenstein - hawking formula , involves gravity ( @xmath4 ) , quantum mechanics ( @xmath11 ) and statistical mechanics ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for this reason , many people believe that the black hole entropy should be a key towards our better understanding of gravity .",
    "in particular , it is expected that the entropy of a black hole should reflect the number of microscopic states associated with the black hole .    in theories and states that allow for holographic dual descriptions ,",
    "the generalized second law is expected to be dual to the ordinary thermodynamic second law since a black hole is probably dual to a thermal state .",
    "therefore , if the generalized second law is violated in a certain setup then it probably implies that there is no corresponding holographic dual description in the conventional sense . in the context of ghost condensation , which is the simplest realization of the higgs mechanism for gravity  @xcite",
    ", there are some proposals to violate the generalized second law in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , it was later shown that if we propose weak enough direct couplings between the field responsible for ghost condensate and the standard model ( sm ) fields or if they have only gravitational interaction through the minimal coupling , then it is possible to prevent the model from violating the generalized second law in a natural effective field theory ( eft ) setup  @xcite .",
    "the point is that under the natural assumption that the field causing ghost condensate is only responsible for the gravity sector , all the interactions between the field for ghost condensate and the sm fields should be suppressed by the planck scale , @xmath13 since such interactions should disappear in the decoupling limit , @xmath14 .",
    "once we admit this at the classical level , the natural assumption of the planckian suppression is not spoiled by radiative corrections since contributions from graviton loops are suppressed by @xmath15 at least .",
    "a specific interaction that was assumed to exist in  @xcite is suppressed by @xmath16 in the presence of the ghost condensate , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the scale of spontaneous lorentz violation .",
    "because of the strong suppression , the physical processes in those proposals for violation of the generalized second law are too slow to decrease the entropy before the accretion of the ghost condensate to the black hole increases it .",
    "we want to emphasize again that it is possible to violate the generalized second law by directly coupling the sm fields to the field causing ghost condensate with strength stronger than gravitational , but as far as the natrual setup is concerned we steer away from such couplings . as already mentioned at the beginning of the present paper , not only black holes but also cosmology are expected to play important roles towards our deep understanding of gravity . in the present paper",
    "we thus consider a cosmological setup to test the theory of ghost condensation .",
    "in particular , our main focus in the present paper is de sitter entropy in inflationary universe .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dsentropy ] we briefly review the de sitter entropy bound conjecture proposed by arkani - hamed , et.al .  @xcite .",
    "we then seek implications of the de sitter entropy bound on ghost inflation in sec .",
    "[ sec : ghostinflation ] . in particular , we show that the de sitter entropy bound is satisfied in our universe . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pagetime ] we propose a notion of cosmological page time .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary of the paper and some discussions .",
    "it has been known that not only black hole horizons but also de sitter horizons have properties similar to thermodynamics . indeed , any bifurcating killing horizon has temperature given by the same formula ( [ eqn : t ] ) @xcite . by applying this to the de sitter case and adopting the natural unit ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the hubble expansion rate .",
    "also , the friedmann equation in a slow - roll inflationary epoch is written in the form of the first law with the de sitter entropy given by the formula ( [ eqn : s ] ) , where @xmath2 is understood as the area of the cosmological horizon  @xcite . again by adopting the natural unit , we obtain @xmath22 .    in quantum gravity , however , it is believed that a de sitter space is unstable on the poincar recurrence time scale @xmath23  @xcite . in the following we thus consider a de sitter space as a part of slow - roll inflation . for slow - roll inflation driven by a canonical scalar field ,",
    "we have @xmath24 this is rewritten as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of e - foldings defined by @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the energy density and @xmath29 is perturbation of the energy density estimated as @xmath30 excluding eternal inflation , we have @xmath31 and thus @xmath32 meaning that the total number of e - folding @xmath33 is bounded from above as @xmath34 here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the de sitter entropy at the end and the beginning of inflation , respectively",
    ".    the inequality ( [ eqn : ntotsend ] ) can be violated if we include the regime of eternal inflation , where @xmath37 becomes of order unity or larger .",
    "however , perturbation generated during the period of eternal inflation is highly nonlinear and would gravitationally collapse to a black hole later at the time of the horizon reentry .",
    "hence there would be no post - inflationary observer who can observe the modes generated during the epoch of eternal inflation .",
    "for this reason , while the bound ( [ eqn : ntotsend ] ) was derived for non - eternal slow - roll inflation , it can be extended to general slow - roll inflation with or without the eternal epoch by simply replacing @xmath33 with the observable number of e - foldings @xmath38 as @xmath39 while the bound ( [ eqn : nobssend ] ) was derived for slow - roll inflation in the above , it was conjectured that the same bound should hold in other models of inflation as well  @xcite .",
    "this is the de sitter entropy bound conjecture .",
    "the bound ( [ eqn : nobssend ] ) states that the observable number of different hubble volumes from a single hubble patch , @xmath40 , be less than @xmath41 .",
    "if we can trust the effective field theory ( eft ) based on the semi - classical approximation , @xmath40 is roughly understood as the observable number of independent modes from inflation .",
    "therefore , neglecting @xmath42 numerical factors , an intuitive interpretation of the de sitter entropy bound ( [ eqn : nobssend ] ) is that the logarithm of the observable number of independent modes from inflation be bounded from above by @xmath35 , as far as the eft is a valid description of cosmological perturbations from inflation .    the de sitter entropy bound ( [ eqn : nobssend ] ) holds in many models of inflation that satisfy the null energy condition .",
    "however , the bound may be violated in models of inflation that violate the null energy condition , as well as those of false vacuum eternal inflation without violation of the null energy condition  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to identify the regime of validity of the de sitter entropy bound conjecture .",
    "in this section let us investigate the implications of the de sitter entropy bound conjecture to ghost inflation , which is inflation driven by ghost condensation , the simplest implementation of analogue of the higgs mechanism in gravity . it is the simplest in the sense that the number of nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson is only one . before studying the de sitter entropy bound conjecture in the context of ghost inflation , we briefly review ghost condensation and then ghost inflation .      in higgs mechanism , the order parameter of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar field , say @xmath43 , charged under the gauge group of interest .",
    "it is therefore supposed that a non - vanishing vev is developed due to a non - trivial potential such as a double - well potential . at the origin @xmath44 fluctuation",
    "is unstable due to the existence of a tachyon , but away from the origin @xmath45 there are stable minima where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the system is thus stabilized at those stable minima and , as a result , the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously , leading to modification of the force law in the infrared .    in ghost condensation , on the other hand , the order parameter of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the vev of derivative of a scalar field , @xmath48 .",
    "it is thus supposed that the system enjoys the shift symmetry , i.e. the action of the system is invariant under a constant shift of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , at least in a range of field space .",
    "let us then consider terms depending on the first derivative of @xmath49 through @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the inverse of the spacetime metric @xmath53 . in the same spirit as in the tachyon instability for the higgs mechanism , let us suppose that the lagrangian of @xmath49 starts with @xmath54 so that the origin @xmath55 is unstable due to a ghost . here",
    "@xmath17 is some mass scale introduced to make @xmath56 and @xmath57 dimensionless . by adding nonlinear terms as @xmath58 $ ]",
    ", can we stabilize the system away from the origin @xmath59 ?",
    "the answer turns out to be yes .",
    "however , since terms nonlinear in @xmath56 become as important as the linear term , we should consider all possible terms consistent with the symmetry as @xmath60,\\ ] ] where we have assumed the symmetry under the field reflection @xmath61 as well as the shift symmetry that we have already invoked .",
    "for example , for @xmath62 in a flat flrw spacetime , the equation of motion for @xmath63 is @xmath64 , meaning that either @xmath65 or @xmath66 as the universe expands ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the latter case is not allowed if the system includes a ghost at the origin @xmath55 .",
    "the system is thus driven to the attractor with @xmath68 , meaning that @xmath59 , provided that the function @xmath69 has a non - zero root @xmath70 .",
    "the stress - energy tensor for this simple system is @xmath71 , agreeing with that of a cosmological constant @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the system at the attractor coupled with gravity allows for a minkowski or de sitter solution , depending on whether @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "similar conclusion can be easily drawn in the presence of other terms such as @xmath75 .",
    "one might worry about the existence of terms with higher time derivatives , but we shall later see by a proper analysis of scaling dimensions that they are irrelevant at low energies so that we can construct a consistent low - energy effective field theory describing fluctuations of the system around the attractor .",
    "let us then assume that a background is characterized by @xmath59 and timelike and that the background metric is maximally symmetric , either minkowski or de sitter .",
    "we call this background ghost condensation . one can choose a gauge so that @xmath76 the residual symmetry is then the spatial diffeomorphism invariance , i.e. the symmetry under time - dependent spatial coordinate transformations @xmath77 we should write down most general action invariant under this residual symmetry . starting with minkowski background for simplicity ( though extension to de sitter background is straightforward ) , @xmath78 , the transformation under the residual symmetry transformation at the linearized level , @xmath79 , is @xmath80 since we assumed that minkowski is a background satisfying the equations of motion , the action should start at the quadratic order .",
    "while @xmath81 is invariant under the residual symmetry transformation , neither @xmath82 nor @xmath83 is .",
    "we thus need to form a linear combination of the ( @xmath84 ) and ( @xmath85 ) components that is invariant under the residual symmetry transformation , and then square it .",
    "the invariant combination is @xmath86 and corresponds to the extrinsic curvature of constant - time hypersurfaces at the linearized level .",
    "we thus have a general lagrangian in the unitary gauge , starting at the quadratic level as @xmath87\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "having constructed the general action in the unitary gauge , it is easy to obtain the action in the general gauge by simply introducing a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson as @xmath90 . concretely , by replacing @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , we obtain @xmath95\\,.\\ ] ]    in the effective theory there are of course higher dimensional operators such as @xmath96 .",
    "we now show that they are irrelevant . for this purpose we need to do proper analysis of scaling dimensions . in the decoupling limit",
    ", one can ignore the mixing between the ng boson and the metric perturbation and thus the dynamics of @xmath97 is well described by the effective action of the form @xmath98\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 .",
    "it is obvious that the scaling dimension of @xmath97 is not @xmath100 but @xmath101 as the action is invariant under the scaling @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the scaling dimension of nonlinear operators that can enter the effective action .",
    "for example , the leading nonlinear operator is @xmath105 and has the scaling dimension @xmath101 , which is positive .",
    "one can easily see that all other possible nonlinear operators have positive scaling dimensions , meaning that they are irrelevant at low energy ( with energies and momenta @xmath106 ) .",
    "those operators that exist but are irrelevant include terms with higher time derivatives , which lead to superficial new degrees of freedom .",
    "those superficial new degrees of freedom have frequencies higher than @xmath17 and thus are not present in the regime of validity of the low energy effective field theory , provided that we consider @xmath17 as the cutoff scale .",
    "we have thus constructed a good low - energy effective field theory around the ghost condensation .",
    "the scale @xmath17 sets the order parameter of the spontaneous lorentz violation and thus general relativity is recovered in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "we thus expect to have upper bounds on @xmath17 from observations and experiments .",
    "the strongest phenomenological upper bound , @xmath108 comes from the stochastic scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by lumps of positive and negative energies created due to nonlinear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the excitation of ghost condensate is responsible for all dark matter in the universe then one can obtain a ( model - dependent ) lower bound on @xmath17 as  @xcite @xmath109      ghost inflation  @xcite is a model of inflation driven by ghost condensation .",
    "the model is of hybrid type in the sense that the system has not only @xmath49 , that is responsible for the ghost condensation , but also another field @xmath110 , that plays the role of the waterfall field in hybrid inflation models .",
    "for example , one can suppose that the shift symmetry for @xmath49 is locally broken in the range @xmath111 so that the mass squared @xmath112 for @xmath110 around @xmath113 is a positive constant for @xmath114 and a negative constant for @xmath115 , where we have set @xmath116 without loss of generality ( because of the reflection symmetry in the field space ) . for @xmath114 ,",
    "the background is essentially de sitter with @xmath113 , generating scale - invariant perturbations .",
    "a soft breaking of the shift symmetry introduces deviation from the exact scale - invariance  @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath115 , the waterfall field @xmath110 develops a non - vanishing vev , @xmath117 , ending the inflation .",
    "since the scaling dimension of @xmath118 is @xmath101 , the amplitude of quantum fluctuations during ghost inflation is proportional to @xmath119 .",
    "since @xmath49 was normalized by a power of @xmath17 so that @xmath120 is dimensionless , @xmath121 is dimensionless .",
    "thus the amplitude of quantum fluctuation is expected to be of order @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of density perturbation is easily estimated as @xmath123 this estimate agrees with the explicit calculation of the power spectrum . by requiring that this be responsible for the observed amplitude of cosmic microwave background anisotropies , @xmath124 , one thus obtains @xmath125 therefore , the background curvature @xmath126 is much lower than the cutoff scale @xmath127 , meaning that ghost inflation is well within the regime of validity of the low - energy effective field theory .",
    "because of the phenomenological upper bound on @xmath17 shown in ( [ eqn : m<100gev ] ) , the hubble expansion rate during ghost inflation is rather low ( @xmath128 ) , meaning that the amplitude of tensor mode is too low to be observed .",
    "while the hubble expansion rate is low , the energy density @xmath129 does not have to be low and thus the reheating temperature can be well above the @xmath130 scale ( up to @xmath131 or so ) .",
    "one can calculate not only the power spectrum but also the bispectrum  @xcite and trispectrum  @xcite . because of the higher derivative nature of the nonlinear interactions , the non - gaussianity generated by ghost inflation is of the equilateral- and orthogonal - types , while local - type non - gaussianity is rather small .",
    "in particular , the strongest bound on nonlinear interactions comes from the equilateral - type bispectrum and the prediction for the corresponding nonlinear parameter is @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the coefficient of the leading nonlinear operator @xmath134 .",
    "the planck 2015 ( temperature & polarization ) constraint  @xcite is @xmath135 leading to the constraint on the coefficient of the nonlinear operator as @xmath136      having briefly reviewed ghost condensation and ghost inflation , we are now ready to consider implications of the de sitter entropy bound on ghost inflation .",
    "while the de sitter entropy is still given by @xmath22 , the total number of e - foldings @xmath33 is arbitrary .",
    "hence the de sitter entropy bound ( [ eqn : nobssend ] ) is threaten to be violated .",
    "@xcite then argued that ghost inflation spoils the thermodynamic interpretation of the de sitter entropy and thus is incompatible with basic gravitational principles . in this subsection , on the contrary",
    ", we shall show that the de sitter entropy bound ( [ eqn : nobssend ] ) is indeed satisfied in our universe very well when we assume that ghost inflation is responsible for the observed cmb anisotropies .",
    "what is important here is that the left hand side of the de sitter entropy bound ( [ eqn : nobssend ] ) is not the total number of e - foldings @xmath33 but the observable number of e - foldings @xmath38 and that superhorizon modes never reenter the horizon in the late time universe dominated by dark energy .    for simplicity",
    "we suppose that after the end of ghost inflation at @xmath138 , our universe experienced a matter dominated ( md ) epoch due to the oscillation of the waterfall field @xmath110 , followed by a reheating at @xmath139 and then a radiation dominated ( rd ) epoch until the radiation - matter equality at @xmath140 .",
    "after that , the universe is supposed to evolve according to the @xmath141cdm cosmology ( but with a priori arbitrary parameter values ) . just for simplicity",
    "we also assume that the late - time acceleration ( @xmath142 ) starts well after the matter - radiation equality as in our universe .",
    "we shall then seek a lower bound on @xmath143 by requiring that the de sitter entropy bound for ghost inflation be satisfied , where @xmath141 is the effective cosmological constant ( that is the sum of the genuine cosmological constant and the contribution from the ghost condensation ) and @xmath144 is the present value of the hubble expansion rate .",

    "this is because at around @xmath251 the number of observable modes starts to exceed the number of physical degrees of freedom accessible during inflation , and thus those superficially independent , observable modes can not be independent of each other .",

    "we have revisited the issue of de sitter entropy in ghost inflation . as we have briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dsentropy ] , it was conjectured in @xcite that the number of e - foldings that can be observed by late time observers should be bounded from above by the de sitter entropy at the end of inflation @xmath35 .",
    "this conjecture is supported by a number of evidences .",
    "for example , the bound holds in the standard slow - roll inflation . also , in slow - roll eternal inflation ,",
    "while the total number of e - foldings can be significantly larger than the de sitter entropy , the formation of a black hole prevents the extra e - foldings from being observed by late time observers . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ghostinflation ] we have then investigated the implications of the de sitter entropy bound conjecture to ghost inflation . in the ghost inflation ( as in the slow - roll eternal inflation ) , the total e - folding number is arbitrary in principle , and thus there is a potential danger that the model might break the de sitter entropy bound .",
    "this may be an interesting opportunity in the sense that the de sitter entropy bound conjecture might provide us with a non - trivial constraint on cosmological parameters .",
    "intriguingly , as we have shown in subsection  [ subsec : omegalambda ] , the de sitter entropy bound can be restated as a lower bound on the value of the ( effective ) cosmological constant at the present time .",
    "this is simply because the maximum comoving scale which had been created in the inflationary era and reentered into the hubble horizon is constrained from above by the horizon scale of the ( effective ) cosmological constant at present , and it gives an upper bound on the value of the observable number of e - foldings .",
    "this means that if we adopt the ghost inflation model for the early accelerated expansion of the universe , we can obtain the lower bound on the ( effective ) cosmological constant at late time by the de sitter entropy bound . fortunately or unfortunately , the lower bound is as weak as @xmath252 .",
    "compared with this extremely tiny lower bound , the observed value of the cosmological constant in our present universe is tremendously large . thus the de sitter entropy bound is always satisfied for the ghost inflation in our universe .",
    "moreover , even if the ( effective ) cosmological constant decays to essentially zero sometime in the future so that the de sitter entropy bound is eventually violated in the further distant future , it means neither that the ghost inflation is invalid at all time from the beginning to the end as the eft nor that we will be crushed by black holes surrounding us as in the eternal slow - roll inflation case .",
    "we have drawn this conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : pagetime ] , by comparison with the case of an evaporating black hole . according to the page s argument on the black hole evaporation",
    ", we can investigate the hawking radiation with the use of the semi - classical eft , as far as the dimension of the hilbert space associated with radiated modes is sufficiently less than that associated with the black hole .",
    "as the evaporation proceeds and the hilbert space associated with the radiation becomes as large as the black hole s , or the system reaches the page time , then we for the first time become unable to use the eft to calculate physical quantities involving modes more than @xmath253 .",
    "this is interpreted as follows : after the page time , the uncertainties in correlations among the radiation modes as many as the dimension of the hilbert space of the black hole accumulates as much as giving @xmath42 deviation from the prediction of the eft . as a result",
    ", the eft description is expected to break down at around the page time . however , after the page time , we just become unable to use the eft to make correct predictions , and if the black hole continues to evaporate , we can still watch the black hole evaporation perhaps through observing the radiation .    as an analog of the page s argument on the black hole evaporation , we can safely use the eft in the ghost inflation model to calculate correlations among inflationary modes that reenter the horizon well before the cosmological page time @xmath226 , which is defined as the time when the observed e - folding number becomes roughly equal to the de sitter entropy at the end of inflation .",
    "we can use the eft in the ghost inflation well before @xmath226 since the uncertainties in correlations among the different hubble patches and the inflationary modes have not yet accumulated as much as giving @xmath42 deviation from the prediction of the eft . only at and after around @xmath226",
    ", we become unable to use the eft for the calculation of quantities involving the hubble patches and/or the inflationary modes more than @xmath254 since the uncertainties in correlations accumulate as much as giving @xmath42 deviation from the prediction of the eft .",
    "whilst in the eternal slow - roll inflation model we will be crushed by the black hole after @xmath226 , we do not expect such a catastrophic event after @xmath226 in the ghost inflation model .",
    "therefore , as in the case of black hole evaporation , it is in principle possible in the late time universe after ghost inflation to keep observing further inflationary modes although the eft prediction is not necessarily useful after @xmath226 .    based on page s argument reviewed in subsection [ subsec : information ] , if one observes only a small subsystem of a large system at one time then it is expected that the eft does not result in any contradiction : both the eft and the entropy argument would conclude that the amount of information to be recovered is tiny .",
    "for this reason , if we merely intend to describe part of the hawking radiation a one time , then we may still be able to use the eft even after the page time , as far as the dimension of the hilbert space associated with the part of radiation that we intend to describe is sufficiently smaller than that of the hilbert space for the rest of system .",
    "in the ghost inflation model , as in the black hole evaporation , we are not able to use the eft to describe physical quantities involving the hubble patches and/or the inflationary modes more than @xmath254 , for example , @xmath255-point correlation functions with too large @xmath255 . on the other hand , we may safely use the eft if we merely intend to describe physical quantities involving smaller number of hubble patches and inflationary modes , even after @xmath226 .    in summary",
    ", the ghost inflation always satisfies the de sitter entropy bound if the ( effective ) cosmological constant of the present universe keeps its value for the future . even if the ( effective ) cosmological constant decays to zero or an extremely small value sometime in the future , it is in an extremely distant future @xmath251 when the de sitter entropy bound is eventually violated . at around @xmath226 ,",
    "we for the first time become unable to use the eft to describe physical quantities involving hubble patches and/or inflationary modes more than @xmath254 . after that , although we expect @xmath42 deviation from the eft prediction , we can still survive the page time and keep observing further modes reentering the horizon . without knowing the uv - completion for ghost inflation and general relativity it is not easy to predict what the future observer will detect on his / her sky after the page time .",
    "nevertheless , it is not far from intuition that he / she might see unforecasted correlations between very early and very late horizon - reentered modes and that he / she can not describe those novel correlations by the eft that people today know of .",
