    "ultracold atomic physics has attracted a lot of interest in recent years with the opportunity to study strongly correlated effects , such as high - temperature superconductivity , in a new context @xcite . in particular , loading cold atomic gases into an optical lattice allows for the realization of bosonic and fermionic lattice models and the experimental study of exotic quantum phases  @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is the toolbox to engineer the three - dimensional bose - hubbard model @xcite and the observation of its mott insulator  superfluid quantum phase transition with cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "ultracold atomic systems also offer an opportunity to investigate the effect of spin degeneracy since the atomic total angular momentum @xmath6 , which includes both electron and nuclear spins , can be larger than @xmath7 resulting in @xmath8 hyperfine states . in magnetic traps ,",
    "these @xmath8 components are split , while in optical traps these ( hyperfine ) spin degrees of freedom are degenerate and novel interesting phases might emerge . for instance , bose - einstein condensates of bosonic atoms with a nonzero total spin @xmath6 are expected to display rich interesting structures in spin space like in superfluid @xmath9he . in this",
    "respect , various exotic superfluid condensates ( including nematic ones ) , mott insulating phases , and non - trivial vortex structures have been predicted recently in spinor bosonic atoms with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these theoretical predictions might be checked in the context of bose - einstein condensates of sodium , rubidium atoms @xcite and in spin-3 atom of @xmath11cr  @xcite .",
    "the spin - degeneracy in fermionic atoms , like @xmath12li , @xmath13k or @xmath14yb , is also expected to give rise to some interesting superfluid phases @xcite . in particular , a molecular superfluid ( ms ) phase might be stabilized in multicomponent attractive fermi gas where more than two fermions form a bound state .",
    "such a non - trivial superfluid behavior has already been found in different contexts . in nuclear physics , a four - particle condensate like the @xmath15 particle",
    "is favored over deuteron condensation at low density @xcite and it may have implications for light nuclei and asymmetric matter in nuclear stars @xcite . this quartet condensation can occur in the field of semiconductors with the formation of biexciton @xcite .",
    "a quartetting phase , which stems from the pairing of cooper pairs , also appears in a model of one - dimensional josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "a possible experimental observation of quartets might be found in superconducting quantum interference devices with ( 100)/(110 ) interfaces of two d - wave superconductors @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath16 periodicity of the critical current with applied magnetic flux has been interpreted as the formation of quartets with total charge @xmath17 @xcite . finally , a bipairing mechanism has also been predicted in four - leg hubbard ladders @xcite .",

    "the mott - insulating phases for the case of one atom per site are also investigated .",

    "the calculation relies on the continuous representation of the spin operators , @xmath355 , where the numbers @xmath356 are non - universal amplitudes .",
    "this procedure yields a low - energy hamiltonian density exactly of the form ( [ spinham ] ) , with couplings @xmath357 and @xmath358 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath359 and @xmath360 are not known ( they depend on non - universal amplitudes ) , but it is sufficient to know that @xmath361 at the su(@xmath2 ) invariant point , and that @xmath362 at small @xmath354 .",
    "the rg analysis of section [ rganalysis ] thus leads to the conclusion that the spin sector undergoes a transition at @xmath43 , between a quantum critical phase ( @xmath297 ) , that coincides with the mott phase i , and a spin gapped phase ( @xmath168 ) with unbroken @xmath214 symmetry , which is mott phase iii .",
    "the strong coupling expansion thus establishes that the exact position of the transition line between these two mott phases is @xmath363 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the zero - temperature phase diagram of one - dimensional spin-@xmath364 fermionic cold atoms with contact interactions . in the low - energy limit",
    ", a cft approach has been developed to deduce the main physical properties of the model by exploiting the presence of an extended sp(@xmath2 ) symmetry . in the @xmath51 case , this sp(@xmath365 ) @xmath132 so(@xmath366 ) symmetry is exact on the lattice while for larger @xmath6 its existence stems from a fine - tuning of the coupling constants i.e. the scattering lengths of the atoms .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is very rich for incommensurate filling with the competition between instabilities of very different nature .",
    "in particular , two different superfluid phases are found for attractive interactions : a sp(@xmath2)-singlet bcs pairing phase and a ms phase .",
    "the latter phase is an su(@xmath2 ) singlet which is formed from bound states of @xmath2 fermions .",
    "for instance , for @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath51 , it is the analogous of the @xmath15 particle in nuclear physics . at the heart of this competition is a @xmath3 discrete symmetry which is the coset between the center of the su(@xmath2 ) group and the center of the sp(@xmath2 ) one . since sp(@xmath2 ) and su(2 ) share the same center group , this @xmath3 symmetry is not an artifact of the extended sp(@xmath2 ) symmetry for @xmath5 and is present for general su@xmath367-invariant multicomponent fermi gas .",
    "the @xmath3 symmetry plays a crucial role and provides a new important ingredient which is not present for @xmath49 .    in the low - energy approach",
    ", this discrete symmetry corresponds to the symmetry of the low - temperature phase of an effective two - dimensional @xmath3 generalized ising model .",
    "if the @xmath3 symmetry is not spontaneously broken , we find the suppression of the singlet - pairing bcs phase with the confinement of the electronic charge @xmath368 to multiple of @xmath369 . in this case , the nature of the dominant instability of this phase depends on the non - universal luttinger parameter @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath245 , the leading instability is a @xmath226 cdw while a quasi - long - range ms phase emerges for @xmath246 and should be the generic phase for attractive interactions at sufficiently small density .",
    "due to its confinement properties and the existence of a spin gap , this ms phase can also be viewed as nematic luther - emery liquid . when the @xmath3 symmetry is spontaneously broken , a quasi - long - range bcs phase is stabilized when @xmath266 whereas a mdw phase appears for @xmath267 .",
    "the quantum phase transition between the confined and bcs phases is described by the @xmath3 parafermionic cft perturbed by the second thermal operator . for @xmath51 and @xmath370 ,",
    "the transition is universal and belongs respectively to the ising and three - state potts universality classes . for higher spins @xmath5 ,",
    "the transition is non - universal and is either of first - order or in the u(1 ) kt universality class .    for commensurate filling of one atom per site , in sharp contrast to the @xmath49 case ,",
    "a mott transition is predicted to occur for @xmath1 as the result of the spin degeneracy .",
    "three different mott - insulating phases are expected which depend on the status of the @xmath3 symmetry . a mott phase with @xmath158 gapless spin modes",
    "is first found which is qualitatively similar to the insulating phase of the su(@xmath2 ) hubbard chain .",
    "the two others have a spin gap and display spin - peierls ( bond ) ordering with a @xmath2 or a two - fold ground - state degeneracy .",
    "regarding perspectives , it will be interesting to investigate numerically the phase diagram for @xmath371 spins by means of large - scale dmrg or qmc calculations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the three - state potts universal behavior of the quantum phase transition might be confirmed numerically as well as the study of the mott transition and the different mott - insulating phases for one atom per site . from the theoretical point of view , another important question is the phase diagram for incommensurate filling of the su(2 ) model ( [ hubbardsgen ] ) for @xmath372 without any sp(@xmath2 ) fine - tuning .",
    "finally , we hope that the exotic ms phase for general @xmath373 spins , discussed in this paper , will be observed in future experiments in ultracold spinor fermionic atoms .",
