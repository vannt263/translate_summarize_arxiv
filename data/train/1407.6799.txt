    "recently there is a broad literature on the subjects of response functions in superconductors and atomic fermi gas superfluids @xcite , where inter - particle interaction is strong enough such that the classical bcs theory is not adequate here .",
    "related experiments include the studies of the thermodynamic response functions and dynamical response@xcite .",
    "theoretically , linear response theories have been an important tool for studying the transport and dynamic properties of fermi gases .",
    "hence , it is important to assess the self consistency of the linear response theories as well as comparing the experimental results . there must be some general rules that the theory must follow . in the references @xcite ,",
    "several fundamental constraints associated with the conservation laws / ward identities and sum rules were addressed .",
    "since the conservation laws are generically related to some ( gauge ) symmetry of the theory , then in the broken - symmetry phase or ordered phase it is particular difficult for many - body theories to satisfy all these constraints .",
    "it was also pointed out that the strict weakly interacting bcs mean field theory does pass all these testings both below and above @xmath0 even when the pairing population is unbalanced @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the linear response theories of bcs superfluids can be formulated into a fully gauge invariant theory . in the normal state ,",
    "the simplest nozieres schimitt - rink ( nsr ) is also compatible with these gauge invariance condition @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the bcs mean field theory is not suitable to describe the fermionic superfluid when the inter - particle interaction becomes strong . moreover , in the broken - symmetry phase , the consistent generalization of the linear response theory based on the nsr theory may meet great difficulties since a first order transition appears at the symmetry - breaking temperature , @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we try to build an ideal linear response theory for strongly correlated superdfluids undergoing bcs - bec crossover by a diagrammatic approach such that the fundamental constraints mentioned above can be satisfied .",
    "our selected diagrams bear on those associated with the goldstone modes due to the symmetry - breaking via the consistent - fluctuation - of the order parameter ( cfop ) approach , and conventional contributions , namely , the maki - thompson ( mt ) and aslamazov - larkin ( al ) diagrams . as a price",
    ", we have to adapt a slightly modified @xmath2 formalism to incorporate the pairing fluctuation effect .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is purely a theoretical attempt until now .",
    "however , it might be a necessary step to fully understand the transport properties of strongly correlated fermi gases .",
    "the linear response theories must be consistent with several fundamental constraints @xcite imposed by the ward identities , @xmath3-limit ward identity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the ward identities guarantees the gauge invariance of the theory , while the @xmath3-limit ward identities lead to the sum rules of compressibility and spin susceptibilities which further build the consistent connection between the single - particle thermodynamics and two - particle correlation functions . however , for spin response theory the @xmath3-limit ward identity is only meaningful to polarized fermi superfluids @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the unpolarized fermi superfluids .",
    "the central difficulty of formulating the consistent linear response theory is to maintain the gauge invariance when the pseudogap self - energy is introduced by the pairing fluctuation effect .",
    "this is obviously beyond the cfop approach since the total energy gap is now different from the order parameter .    in the following sections",
    ", we first briefly review the cfop linear response theories both in the density and spin channels for bcs mean field theory , then we introduce the pairing fluctuation effects via a particular @xmath1-matrix formalism .",
    "we further carry on extra diagrammatic corrections in the two channels , and verify that the new theories do maintain the gauge symmetry respectively . throughout this paper",
    ", we follow the convention @xmath4 .",
    "by using the @xmath5 to denote the spin or pseudo - spin @xmath6 , the hamiltonian for a two component fermi gas interacting via the attractive contact interaction @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the annihilation and creation operators of fermions , @xmath11 is the chemical potential and @xmath12 is the fermion mass .",
    "there is an implicit summation over the pseudo - spin indices @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian has a u(1)@xmath13 u(1 ) symmetry @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the phase parameter of those transformations .",
    "the first u(1 ) symmetry is well known for relating to the electromagnetism ( em ) . if the particle is charged , this symmetry naturally becomes a gauge symmetry . for a charge neutral system ,",
    "the symmetry is still associated with the mass current conservation .",
    "the second symmetry is the spin rotational symmetry which is associated with the spin current conservation .",
    "our linear response theories in the density and spin channels must respect these two symmetries respectively .",
    "the central idea is to `` gauge '' the u(1 ) symmetries by introducing two types of weak external fields . in the density channel",
    ", it is the weak em field @xmath17 . while in the spin channel",
    ", it is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 component of the magnetic field ( assuming @xmath20 is the axis of spin rotation ) and @xmath21 is the magnetization .    after taking bcs mean field approximation , the order parameter or superconducting gap function",
    "is introduced @xmath22 .",
    "the first u(1 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken while the second is not . as can be seen in the reference @xcite , this brings significant difference between the linear response theories in the two channels . for a homogeneous system",
    ", the bcs hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 . as a familiar result ,",

    "define @xmath28 , the number and gap equations are determined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these identities give @xmath31,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{1}{g}&=&\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}}\\frac{1 - 2f(e_{\\textrm{sc}\\mathbf{p}})}{2e_{\\textrm{sc}\\mathbf{p}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bare green function is @xmath32 .",
    "the dyson equation gives @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bcs self - energy .          in the density channel ,",
    "the system is perturbed by an effective external em field @xmath35 , and the hamiltonian becomes @xmath36 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bare em interaction vertex .",
    "here @xmath39 is the external four momentum , where @xmath40 is the boson matsubara frequency .",
    "the bare vertex satisfies the `` bare '' ward identity @xmath41 in a gauge invariant em linear response theory , a full em interaction vertex @xmath42 ( the bare and full em vertices are shown in figure.[fig : dv ] ) which satisfies the full ward identity @xmath43 must be found , so that the perturbed current can be expressed as @xmath44 with @xmath45 determined by the kubo formalism @xmath46 where @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the metric tensor . by using the ward identity ( [ wi0 ] ) ,",
    "it s easy to show that @xmath49 , which further leads to the conservation of perturbed current @xmath50 .",
    "hence the linear response theory is indeed gauge invariant . under the framework of bcs mean field theory ,",
    "such full vertex can be obtained either by nambu s integral - equation approach @xcite or by the cfop approach .",
    "however , the @xmath3-limit ward identity provides an independent consistency check of the theory .",
    "the vertex given by the latter approach is proved to satisfy this condition @xmath51 details can be found in the reference @xcite .",
    "this identity not only builds a consistent connection between the one - particle thermodynamics and two - particle response functions but also the acts as the sufficient and necessary condition for the compressibility sum rule @xmath52        the expression of this gauge invariant interaction vertex given by the cfop approach is @xmath53 where the second term , @xmath54 corresponds to the excitations of nambu - goldstone modes due to the breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry , and the third term , @xmath55 is the famous mt diagram which is shown in figure.[fig : mt ] . the expressions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given in appendix.[app1 ] .",
    "these two terms originates from summing up the diagrams with photon - fermion interaction lines inserted at any possible position . by using the equalities @xcite",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 , it can be shown that @xmath60 combining with the equality @xmath61 the ward identity ( [ wi0 ] ) in the bcs mean field level can be proved .          in the spin channel , the u(1 )",
    "spin rotational symmetry is also `` gauged '' by introducing an effective external field .",
    "however , this symmetry is not broken by the order parameter .",
    "therefore we expect that the structure of the spin linear response theory is simpler than that of its density counterpart .",
    "the `` bare '' spin interaction vertex is dependent on the pseudo - spin : @xmath62 with the subscript `` s '' referring to the `` spin '' .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 indicates that the vertex has different signs for different pseudo - spin indices , see figure.[fig : s - v ] .",
    "it also respect the `` bare '' ward identity in the spin channel @xmath64 the spin interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath65 similarly , the perturbed spin current is also evaluated via the kubo formalism @xmath66 where @xmath67 the full spin interaction vertex @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 where the mt term is expressed as @xmath70 since the u(1 ) spin rotational symmetry is not broken below @xmath0 , then the full spin interaction vertex does not contain contributions associated with the nambu - goldstone modes . moreover , the ward identity is indeed satisfied in the mean field theory level @xmath71 therefore the perturbed spin current is conserved @xmath72 . in the spin channel , there is no well - defined @xmath3-limit ward identity for unpolarized fermi superfluids although such identity does exist for polarized fermi superfluids @xcite .",
    "this is because the equal - population case can not be approached from the population imbalanced case by simply letting the particle number difference approach zero .",
    "the above discussions show that the linear response theories in the density and spin channels are fully consistent with the bcs mean field approximation for fermi superfluids . however , when generalized to the whole bcs - bec crossover regime , the mean field approximation overestimates the critical temperature in the unitarity and bec side since the fluctuations of the non - condensed pairs are ignored .",
    "we next show a formally theoretical scheme in which the fundamental constraints are still satisfied when the pairing fluctuation effects are included .",
    "when we consider the situation that the interaction between fermions is stronger than the bcs attraction , the self - energy obtains corrections from the non - condensed pairs .",
    "hence the interaction vertex must be corrected correspondingly to ensure an exact validity of the ward identity and @xmath3-limit ward identity . in this paper , we adapt the @xmath2 formalism @xcite to discuss the pseudo - gap effect .",
    "the self - energy due to the non - condensed pair is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the @xmath1-matrix due to non - condensed pairs .",
    "the pair susceptibility is constructed in the @xmath2 formalism @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the full green function with pairing fluctuation effect included .",
    "here we assume that the coupling constant between fermions in non - condensed pairs , @xmath77 , is not necessarily equal to @xmath7 , the coupling constant between fermions in condensed pairs . to determine the pairing onset temperature @xmath78",
    ", we still use the thouless criteria , i.e. , @xmath79 is divergent at @xmath78 , or @xmath80 one possible reason that @xmath77 may not be equal to @xmath7 is that the thouless criteria can not reduce to the bcs gap equation even when @xmath81 . similarly , the @xmath1-matrix due to the condensed pair is @xmath82 , and the bcs self - energy is also expressed as @xmath83 .",
    "the order parameter is still determined by @xmath84 , which is non - zero below @xmath0 .",
