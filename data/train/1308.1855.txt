    "classical cepheid variable stars are primary distance indicators and rank among standard candles for establishing the cosmic distance scale , owing to the famous period - luminosity ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) relationship .",
    "companions to cepheids , however , complicate the situation .",
    "the contribution of the secondary star to the observed brightness has to be taken into account when involving any particular cepheid in the calibration of the @xmath0@xmath1 relationship .",
    "binaries among cepheids are not rare at all : their frequency exceeds 50 per cent for the brightest cepheids , while among the fainter cepheids an observational selection effect encumbers revealing binarity @xcite .    owing to some observational projects aimed at obtaining new radial velocities ( rvs ) of numerous cepheids carried out during the last decades ,",

    "this progress is visualized in fig .",

    "the data have been taken from the on - line data base on binaries among galactic cepheids ( http://www.konkoly.hu/cep/orbit.html ) .",
    "to get rid of the fluctuation at the left - hand part of the diagram , brightest cepheids ( @xmath2  mag ) were merged in a single bin because such stars are extremely rare among cepheids  see the histogram in fig .",

    ", spectroscopic binarity manifests itself in a periodic variation of the @xmath3-velocity ( i.e. , the rv of the mass centre of the cepheid ) . in practice , the orbital rv variation of the cepheid component",
    "is superimposed on the rv variations of pulsational origin .",
    "to separate orbital and pulsational effects , knowledge of the accurate pulsation period is essential , especially when comparing rv data obtained at widely differing epochs .",
    "therefore , the pulsation period and its variations have been determined with the method of the o@xmath4c diagram @xcite for each target cepheid .",

    "we performed an rv survey of cepheids with the 2.3  m anu telescope located at the siding spring observatory ( sso ) , australia .",
    "the main aim of the project was to detect cepheids in binary systems by measuring changes in the mean values of their rv curve which can be interpreted as the orbital motion of the cepheid around the centre - of - mass in a binary system ( change of @xmath3-velocity ) .",
    "the target list was compiled to include cepheids with a single - epoch rv phase curve or without any published rv data .",
    "several cepheids suspected to be members of sb systems were also put on the target list . in 64 nights between 2004 october and 2006 march we monitored 40 cepheids with pulsation periods between 2 and 30 d. additional spectra of some targets",
    "were obtained in 2007 august .",
    "medium - resolution spectra were taken with the double beam spectrograph using the 1200  mm@xmath5 gratings in both arms of the spectrograph .",
    "the projected slit width was 2 arcsec on the sky , which was about the median seeing during our observations .",
    "the spectra covered the wavelength ranges 42005200    in the blue arm and 57006700    in the red arm .",
    "the dispersion was 0.55    pixel@xmath5 , leading to a nominal resolution of about 1   .",
    "all spectra were reduced with standard tasks in iraf .",
    "reduction consisted of bias and flat - field corrections , aperture extraction , wavelength calibration , and continuum normalization .",
    "we checked the consistency of wavelength calibrations via the constant positions of strong telluric features , which proved the stability of the system .",
    "rvs were determined only for the red arm data with the task _ fxcor _ , applying the cross - correlation method using a well - matching theoretical template spectrum from the extensive spectral library of @xcite .",
    "then , we made barycentric corrections to every single rv value .",
    "this method resulted in a 1 - 2  km  s@xmath5 uncertainty in the individual rvs , while further tests have shown that our absolute velocity frame was stable to within @xmath623  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this level of precision is sufficient to detect a number of cepheid companions , as they can often cause @xmath3-velocity changes well above 10  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "discovery of six sbs among the 40 target cepheids was already reported by @xcite .",
    "the binarity of the three cepheids announced here could be revealed by involving independently obtained additional data ( see section  [ coralie ] ) .",
    "the individual rv data of the rest of the cepheid targets will be published together with the results of the analysis of the spectra .",
    "all three cepheids were among the targets during multiple observing campaigns between 2011 april and 2012 may using the fibre - fed high - resolution ( @xmath7 ) echelle spectrograph _ coralie _ mounted on the swiss 1.2 m euler telescope at eso la silla observatory , chile .",
    "the instrument s design is described in @xcite ; recent instrumental updates can be found in @xcite .",
    "when it turned out that these three cepheids have variable @xmath3-velocities , several new spectra were obtained in 2012 december - 2013 january and 2013 april .",
    "the spectra are reduced by the efficient online reduction pipeline that performs bias correction , cosmics removal , and flatfielding using tungsten lamps .",
    "thar lamps are used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "the reduction pipeline directly determines the rv via cross - correlation @xcite using a mask that resembles a g2 spectral type .",
    "the rv stability of the instrument is excellent and for non - pulsating stars the rv precision is limited by photon noise ; ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the precision achieved for cepheids is lower due to line asymmetries .",
