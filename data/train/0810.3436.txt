    "@xmath0 mesons are produced nearly at rest , with a visible cross section of @xmath8  3.1  @xmath9b and decay into @xmath10 ( br@xmath11% ) or @xmath12 ( br@xmath13% ) ; neutral and charged kaons have momenta of 110 and 127 me-.07em v , respectively .    the kaon pairs from @xmath0 decay",
    "are produced in a pure @xmath14 quantum state , so that the detection of a ( ) thus signals , or tags , the presence of a ( ) .",
    "this in effect creates pure  and  beams of precisely known momenta ( event by event , from kinematic closure ) and flux , which can be used to measure absolute  and  brs .",
    "similar arguments hold for @xmath15 and @xmath16 as well .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 can be distinguished by their mean decay lengths : @xmath19  0.6  cm and @xmath20  340  cm .",
    "the analysis of kaon decays is performed with the kloe detector  @xcite , consisting essentially of a drift chamber , dch , surrounded by an electromagnetic calorimeter , emc .",
    "a superconducting coil provides a 0.52  t magnetic field .",
    "the dch is a cylinder of 4  m in diameter and 3.3  m in length , which constitutes a fiducial volume for @xmath21 decays extending for @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the momentum resolution for tracks at large polar angle is @xmath23% .",
    "the emc is a lead / scintillating - fiber sampling calorimeter consisting of a barrel and two endcaps , with good energy resolution , @xmath24 , and excellent time resolution , @xmath25  54  ps@xmath26 ps .    in kloe , the identification of -interaction in the emc ( @xmath27  events in the following ) is used to tag the presence of  mesons . @xmath15 and @xmath16 decay with a mean length of @xmath28  90  cm and can be distinguished from their decays in flight to one of the two - body final states @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "momenta reconstructed from identification of 1-prong @xmath31 decay vertices in the dc peak around the expected values with a resolution of 11.5  mev , thus allowing clean and efficient tagging .",
    "in early 2006 , the kloe experiment completed data taking , having collected @xmath32  fb@xmath33 of integrated luminosity at the @xmath0 peak , corresponding to @xmath83.8 billion @xmath12 pairs , and to @xmath82.6 billion @xmath34 pairs",
    "in chpt calculations of the amplitude for k@xmath35 process , since all particles involved are neutral , there are non tree - level contributions . moreover , at @xmath36 , only finite chiral - meson loops contribute .",
    "br(k@xmath1 ) is predicted unambiguously at this level in terms of the couplings g@xmath37 and g@xmath38 , giving @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the most precise published measurement of this br is from na48 : br = 2.78(6)(4)@xmath40  @xcite .",
    "this result would suggest the need for a significant @xmath41 correction in the chpt calculation of the br .",
    "kloe searched for the decay @xmath42 in a sample of @xmath43 @xmath44 decays which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.9 fb@xmath33 .",
    "two prompt photons must be detected , and @xmath45 decays counted in the same sample , are used as normalization sample .",
    "kloe measured  @xcite : @xmath46 .",

    "[ ksggres ] , left panel . while the number of k@xmath48 observed by kloe",
    "is @xmath8700 , as compared to the @xmath87500 observed by na48 , kloe profits from the use of a tagged k@xmath49 beam and does not have to contend with irreducible background from k@xmath50    precise chpt theory calculation for this decay are done at @xmath36 .",
    "higher order effects are predicted to be at most of the order of @xmath8 20% of the @xmath36 decay amplitude .",
    "our measurement is consistent with negligible higher order corrections .",
    "the decay @xmath51 , like the decay @xmath52  or @xmath53 , is a flavour - changing neutral - current process , suppressed in the standard model and dominated by the two - photon intermediate state  @xcite . for both  and , the  channel is much more suppressed than the @xmath54 one ( by a factor of @xmath55 ) .",
    "using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath56 ) to order @xmath57 , the sm prediction for br@xmath58 is evaluated to be @xmath59 . a value significantly higher than expected would point to new physics .",
    "the best experimental limit for @xmath60 has been measured by cplear  @xcite , and it is equal to @xmath61 , at @xmath62  cl .",
    "@xmath63 million @xmath27  events are used as a starting sample for the @xmath51  search .",
    "@xmath51  events are selected by requiring the presence of two tracks of opposite charge with their point of closest approach to the origin inside a cylinder @xmath64 in radius and @xmath65 in length along the beam line .",
    "the track momenta and polar angles must satisfy the fiducial cuts @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the tracks must also reach the emc without spiralling , and have an associated cluster .",
    "the two - track invariant mass is evaluated in electron hypothesis ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "a preselection cut requiring @xmath69 has been applied , which rejects most of @xmath70 events , for which @xmath71 . the residual background has two main components : @xmath72  events , populating the low @xmath68 region , and @xmath73  events , spreading over the whole spectrum .",
    "the @xmath72  events have such a wrong reconstructed @xmath68 because of track resolution or one pion decaying into a muon .",
    "the @xmath73  events enter the preselection because of a machine background cluster , accidentally satisfying the @xmath27  algorithm .",
    "after preselection we are left with @xmath74 events . to have a better separation between signal and background ,",
    "a @xmath75-like variable is defined , collecting information from the clusters associated to the candidate electron tracks .",
    "a signal box to select the @xmath51  events can be conveniently defined in the @xmath76 plane .",
    "the @xmath75 cut for the signal box definition has been chosen to remove all mc background events : @xmath77 .",
    "the cut on @xmath68 is practically set by the @xmath78 cut , which rules out all signal events with a radiated photon with energy greater than @xmath79 , corresponding to an invariant mass window : @xmath80 .",
    "the signal box selection on data gives @xmath81 .",
    "the upper limit at @xmath62 cl on the expected number of signal events is @xmath82 .",
    "the total selection efficiency on @xmath51  events is evaluated by mc , and includes contribution from radiative corrections .",
    "the number of @xmath72  events @xmath83 counted on the same sample of  tagged events is used as normalization . the upper limit on br(@xmath51 )",
    "is evaluated as follows : @xmath84 using @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath88 our measurement improves by a factor of @xmath89 on the cplear result  @xcite , for the first time including radiative corrections in the evaluation of the upper limit .",
    "a strong interest for a new measurement of the ratio @xmath91 has recently arisen , triggered by the work of ref .",
    "the sm prediction of @xmath92 benefits from cancellation of hadronic uncertainties to a large extent and therefore can be calculated with high precision . including radiative corrections , the total uncertainty is less than 0.5 per mil  @xcite .",
    "since the electronic channel is helicity - suppressed by the @xmath93 structure of the charged weak current , @xmath92 can receive contributions from physics beyond the sm , for example from multi - higgs effects inducing an effective pseudoscalar interaction .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that deviations from the sm of up to few percent on @xmath92 are quite possible in minimal supersymmetric extensions of the sm and in particular should be dominated by lepton - flavor violating contributions with tauonic neutrinos emitted . using the present kloe dataset of @xmath82.5 fb@xmath33 of luminosity integrated at the @xmath0-meson peak ,",
    "we show that an accuracy of about 1  % in the measurement of @xmath92 might be reached .    in order to compare with the sm prediction at this level of accuracy",
    ", one has to treat carefully the effect of radiative corrections , which contribute several percent to the @xmath3 width .",
    "in particular , the sm prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite is made considering all photons emitted by the process of internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) while ignoring any contribution from structure - dependent direct emission ( de ) .",
    "of course both processes contribute , so in the analysis we will consider de as a background which can be distinguished from the ib width by means of a different photon energy spectrum",
    ".    given the @xmath21 decay length of @xmath890  cm , the selection of one - prong @xmath94 decays in the dc required to tag @xmath95 has an efficiency smaller than 50% .",
    "in order to keep the statistical uncertainty on the number of @xmath96  counts below 1% , we decided to perform a `` direct search '' for @xmath96  and @xmath97  decays , without tagging .",
    "since we measure a ratio of br s for two channels with similar topology and kinematics , we expect to benefit from some cancellation of the uncertainties on tracking , vertexing , and kinematic identification efficiencies .",
    "small deviations in the efficiency due to the different masses of @xmath98 s and @xmath9 s can be evaluated using mc .",
    "a powerful kinematic variable used to distinguish @xmath96  and @xmath97  decays from the background is calculated from the momenta of the kaon and the secondary particle measured in dc : assuming zero neutrino mass one can obtain the squared mass of the secondary particle , or lepton mass ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "while the one - prong selection is enough for clean identification of a @xmath97  sample , further rejection is needed in order to identify @xmath96  events : the background , which is dominated by badly reconstructed @xmath97  events , is reduced by a factor of @xmath810 by the quality cuts , but still remains @xmath810 times more frequent than the signal in the region around the electron mass peak .",
    "information from the emc is used to improve background rejection : electron clusters can be further distinguished from @xmath9 ( or @xmath100 ) clusters by exploiting the granularity of the emc , in particular using the spread of energy deposits on each plane ( @xmath101 ) . the pid technique described above selects @xmath96  events with an efficiency @xmath102 and a rejection power for background of @xmath103 .",
    "these numbers have been evaluated from mc .",
    "a likelihood fit to the two - dimensional @xmath101 vs @xmath99 distribution was performed to get the number of signal events .",
    "distribution shapes for signal and background were taken from mc ; the normalizations for the two components are the only fit parameters .",
    "the number of signal events obtained from the fit is @xmath104 .",
    "projections of the fit results onto the @xmath105 axes is compared to real data in fig .",
    "[ ksggres ] , right panel .    the primary generators for @xmath96  and @xmath97  decays include radiative corrections and allow for the emission of a single photon in the final state  @xcite .",
    "@xmath106 events with photon energy in the kaon rest frame @xmath107  mev ( where the de contribution is indeed negligible ) were considered as signal .",
    "the number of @xmath97  events in the same data set is extracted from a similar fit to the @xmath99 distribution the fraction of background events under the muon peak is estimated from mc to be less than one per mil .",
    "the number of @xmath97  events is 499251584@xmath10835403 . using the number of observed @xmath96  and @xmath97  events and all corrections , we get the preliminary result  @xcite @xmath109 this value is compatible within the error with the sm prediction , @xmath110 and with other recent measurements by na48  @xcite .",
    "three sources contribute to the present statistical uncertainty of 1.9% : fluctuation in the signal counts ( 1.1% ) , fluctuation in the background to be subtracted ( 0.7% ) , and statistical error on the mc estimate of the background ( 1.4% ) .",
    "the total error on @xmath92 should be reduced to @xmath111 after analysis completion .",
