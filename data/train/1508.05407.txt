    "in spite of all experimental tests that standard model ( sm ) has passed successfully , it contains many theoretical problems .",
    "therefore sm is assumed to be an effective theory that is valid up to a certain energy scale .",
    "solutions of these shortcomings are proposed by new physics beyond the sm which should exist at tev scale .",
    "hierarchy problem is the main motivation for the existence of new physics at the tev scale .",
    "it is the problem about higgs scalar receiving quadratically divergent loop contribution to its mass through its coupling to sm particles ; the top quark , the weak gauge bosons and its self quadratic term and the mass term requires fine - tuning of huge quantum corrections cancelling each other . in order to solve the hierarchy problem ,",
    "many extended theories are proposed beyond the sm such as supersymmetry , extra dimensional model , left - right twin higgs model and little higgs models .",
    "the little higgs models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem by regarding the sm higgs particle as a pseudo - goldstone boson of a new global symmetry group  @xcite .",
    "the models using collective symmetry breaking can be divided into two groups which provide a natural way giving the higgs boson mass : product group models and simple group models .",
    "their main difference is the choice of the new global symmetry . as a result of collective symmetry breaking ,",
    "little higgs models contain , in addition to the sm , new heavy particles whose contributions cancel the loop quadratic divergences in the higgs mass .",
    "this cancellation occurs between particles which have the same quantum numbers as the sm .",
    "there are several studies in literature on phenomenology of little higgs models  @xcite .",
    "also the models which have different theory space get constraints by electroweak precision measurement data  @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of the little higgs models is `` littlest higgs model '' ( lh )  @xcite .",
    "it is a product group model which is based on @xmath13 non linear sigma model .",
    "the global @xmath14 symmetry containing a gauged subgroup @xmath15\\times \\left[su(2)_{2}\\times u(1)_{2 } \\right ] $ ] is broken to a global @xmath16 symmetry at scale @xmath17 by a vacuum expectation value of order of @xmath18 .",
    "the gauged symmetry @xmath15\\times \\left[su(2)_{2}\\times u(1)_{2 } \\right ] $ ] is spontaneously broken into the @xmath19 , identified as the sm gauge group .",
    "this symmetry breaking results in fourteen goldstone bosons which are parametrized by a non linear sigma field .",
    "four of them are eaten by the heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath20 ) associated with the broken symmetry .",
    "after these gauge bosons obtain their masses , the remaining ten goldstone bosons will come the complex doublet ( @xmath21 ) and complex scalar triplet ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) of the electroweak gauge group which is identified as the sm higgs and complex triplet which gains a mass of the scale @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "also a new vector - like top quark ( @xmath12 ) which is the heavy partner of the sm top quark is taken into account to cancel the quadratically divergent contribution from higgs coupling to the sm top quark .",
    "the new heavy particles proposed by the lh interact with each other and with the sm particles .",
    "the heavy vector like top quark is commonly predicted by many extensions of the sm and limits on the existence of the new particles have been studied in the literature as model dependent and independent  @xcite .",
    "lhc collaborations have performed the searches for the heavy top quark using first run of lhc . the heavy top quark with mass less than 700 gev has been excluded by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite .",
    "in this work , the productions of the new heavy gauge boson @xmath11 and heavy top quark @xmath12 via @xmath24 in the littlest higgs model are examined .",
    "high energy linear @xmath0 colliders which have the clean environment are of particular importance to study production of the new heavy particles predicted by the little higgs models  @xcite . in literature , there are several studies which have analyzed the little higgs models in @xmath0 which can be transformed to @xmath25   and @xmath26 and lhc considering heavy top quark and heavy z gauge boson  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give a brief review of general features of the littlest higgs model . in sec .",
    "iii we will discuss associated production of heavy z boson and heavy top quark in @xmath0 collisions according to free parameters of the model .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "littlest higgs model is a non linear sigma model based on @xmath14 global symmetry which contains a gauged @xmath27_{1}\\times[su(2)\\times u(1)]_{2}$ ] subgroup .",
    "the global @xmath14 is broken into @xmath16 via vacuum expectation value of the sigma field at the @xmath18 scale @xmath28 1 tev  @xcite , @xmath29 the symmetry breaking vacuum expectation value is chosen as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 identity matrix . as a result of the symmetry breaking",
    "there will be fourteen massless goldstone bosons .",
    "four of these will be removed by the higgs mechanism when the @xmath27^{2}$ ] is broken to its diagonal subgroup which is identified as the @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the remaining goldstone bosons are parametrized by a non - linear sigma model field where the goldstone boson matrix @xmath33 is    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a complex doublet , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a complex electroweak doublet which is form    @xmath38    the kinetic term for the @xmath39 field can be written as  @xcite @xmath40 where  @xcite @xmath41\\ ] ] @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the @xmath44 and @xmath45 gauge fields , respectively , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the respective gauge couplings .",
