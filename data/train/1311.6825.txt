    "so far , the quarks are coupled to the chiral mean fields only via the vlasov term . to add additional dynamics and interactions ,",
    "we implement a collision term for the quasi - particles .",
    "this method is equivalent to the approach used in the bamps model @xcite .",
    "the quark s position space is divided into grid cells @xmath21 , allowing all particles within a cell to interact .",
    "the interaction probability is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 denoting an isotropic and constant cross section .",
    "additionally we want to be able to cool down or to heat up the system . implementing a virtual heat bath",
    ", the quasi - particles can interact with thermal particles sampled from a heat bath , allowing the particles to statistically gain or lose energy .",
    "figure [ cooldown1 ] shows the change of the system s temperature due to kinetic interactions of the quarks with a virtual heat bath . in this scenario ,",
    "the quarks are cooled from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "several test cases and scenarios have been simulated . in basic scenarios ,",
    "we have checked for numerical stability , energy conservation , vacuum properties and have compared the temperature dependent equilibrium properties with values from the literature @xcite .",
    "figure [ thermalblobb ] shows a thermal - droplets scenario . the system is initialised with a thermal woods - saxon potential to resemble a hot and dense fireball .",
    "then the system cools down by expansion and shows shell - like structures of the quark distribution and the chiral fields .",

    "both simulated systems are in a box and cooled down by interactions with the heat bath . without the chemical processes ,",
    "no phase transition occurs , and the system is trapped in the chiral - symmetry restored phase.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    extending the current model with chemical processes is not trivial if total energy should be conserved .",
    "the yukawa interaction allows for a @xmath26 reaction .",
    "however , this process is not a continuous one but acts simultaneously on the field and the particles .",
    "while creating and annihilating the particles is a simple numerical exercise , the quasi instantaneous particle - like interaction with the filed is completely undefined .",
    "this problem is discussed in the following section .",
    "in the linear sigma model , particles and chiral fields are coupled via the yukawa like coupling . in our model , this is implemented via the interaction potential in the vlasov equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the gradient of the field energy acts as a continuous force on the quarks , describing the interaction between the quarks and the mean fields .",
    "this interaction changes the quarks momenta but lacks dissipation and entropy production and thus can not drive the system to thermal equilibrium .    by including binary collisions ( see section [ quarkinteraction ] ) between the quarks , a kinetic thermalisation of the quarks",
    "can be achieved , but so far the model lacks thermal and chemical equilibration among the quarks and meson - mean fields , i.e. , collective coherent oscillations of the fields are not damped by the quark bath . in other models",
    "@xcite , the equations of motion are extended with a langevin - like coupling .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 field is damped with a dissipative term , and additionally a noise term is added .",
    "this allows for an effective thermalisation of the meson - mean fields , but the quarks are treated as a large ( thermalised ) reservoir , and the energy and momentum transfer from the mean fields to the medium is neglected .",
    "the friction term in the langevin - mean - field equation thus leads to a continuous rescaling of the quark energy , violating energy ( and momentum ) conservation .    to solve this problem we follow an ansatz motivated from kinetic theory .",
    "thus we treat the dissipation and noise of the mean fields as an interaction between the quarks and the mean fields in a `` collision like '' way , treating the interactions as local in time and with a non - continuous energy - momentum transfer .",
    "the main problem of this approach is to find an effective way to simulate such collision - like interactions between particles and mean fields since the here used classical transport approach lacks a clear interpretation in a kind of `` field - particle duality '' .",
    "here we use energy and momentum as a common feature of particles and fields and describe their exchange between particles and mean fields in a pragmatic stochastical way .",
    "the expressions for the energy of the mean fields follow from the lagrangian making use of noether s theorem applied to the symmetry under space - time translations , leading to the total energy and momentum of the field in a spatial volume @xmath27 , @xmath28\\\\ \\label{gkmomentum } { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{p } } } & = \\int_v { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^3 { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{x } } }",

    "we map this four - momentum to an energy and momentum transfer @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the meson - mean field , @xmath35 .    for a given field @xmath36 ,",
    "the equations of motion describe the propagation of the field to a later time @xmath37 . besides this normal propagation , we allow the field to suffer small kicks @xmath38 at given discrete times @xmath39 and positions @xmath40 .",
    "these kicks can both increase or decrease the field s energy , given by a variable @xmath41 .",
    "the change of the field @xmath42 is constrained by the energy - momentum equations ( [ gkenergy ] ) and ( [ gkmomentum ] ) : @xmath43 - e \\left [ \\phi({\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{x } } } , t_k ) \\right ] , \\\\",

    ", a closed solution can be found , if the potential @xmath44 can be inverted . in the multi - dimensional case , there is no unique solution to ( [ ediff1]-[pdiff1 ] ) anymore , and the field increment @xmath45 has to be parameterised . to obtain mathematical stability in the equations of motion ,",
    "the parameterisation has to be continuous , non - pointlike and must have the same parametrical degrees of freedom as equations ( [ ediff1 ] ) and ( [ pdiff1 ] ) ( two for the one - dimensional case and four for the three - dimensional case ) .",
    "we have chosen a travelling gaussian wave packet as a parameterisation .",
    "even though it is numerically more challenging , we have two advantages compared to the above described langevin approaches : a discrete control of the field energy change @xmath46 allows for the microcanonical description of a field - particle coupling without the need of an uncontrolled heat bath . secondly instead of a continuous and deterministic @xmath47 term , we can model a discrete and monte - carlo like energy transfer @xmath41 .    to test our method ,",
    "we were inspired by @xcite and have investigated a simple but well understood model , the classical damped harmonic oscillator coupled to a langevin equation @xmath48 with the usual dissipation - fluctuation relation for the noise term , @xmath49 these equations of motion describe a damped harmonic oscillator , which is driven by a random force , where @xmath50 is a gaussian random variable ( `` white noise '' ) which can increase or decrease the energy of the system by kicking the oscillator . on average , the oscillator will show a gaussian position distribution and an exponential energy distribution @xmath51 .    to simulate the oscillator with our method , we need to model a @xmath52 for the processes @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the random kicks can be calculated by using the relation @xmath55 which becomes @xmath56 for our numerical simulation , with @xmath57 as the external force .",
    "simulating the damping is more complicated , as we want to allow for non - continuous damping .",
    "therefore we come back to the simple damped oscillator : @xmath58 the oscillator loses energy via the dissipative term @xmath59 . in comparison , we simulate a harmonic oscillator with a dynamic damping , modelled by a stochastic and discrete energy loss , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a little kick which changes the energy of the system and is directly related to the external force @xmath57 . to simulate discrete random kicks at times @xmath39 ( @xmath62 ) , leading to energy changes @xmath63 , we set @xmath64 the probability for the oscillator to lose a given amount of energy @xmath33 is given by : @xmath65 the parameter @xmath66 can be seen as a ` steppiness ' scale of the system ; @xmath67 is the initial energy of the system , and the system can lose an amount @xmath68 in an interaction , leading to the same average energy loss as in the classical case , which scales as @xmath69 for @xmath70 , the original damped oscillator is restored , for @xmath71 , the oscillator s energy is damped via a discrete , statistically decaying exponential function .",
    "this can be nicely seen in figure [ fig1 ] .    .",
    "the statistical method has a scaling of @xmath72 . in the ensemble average ,",
    "both show same decay - properties.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    combining both the method of statistical energy gain and non - continuous damping , we can successfully describe a damped harmonic oscillator , coupled to a langevin force . instead of a continuous and fully random description",
    ", we can now control the energy flow in a discrete way .",
    "this allows us to couple the oscillator or any other wave equation to a finite , microcanonical heat bath or any other discrete system .",
    "we have presented a dynamical , non - equilibrium simulation of a linear @xmath0-model with constituent quarks .",
    "quarks , treated as test particles , and the chiral fields , treated on the mean - field level , are coupled via the corresponding mean - field equation . for additional dynamics ,",
    "a binary - collision term has been implemented for the quarks .",
    "elastic interactions allow an efficient thermalisation of the quarks . however , this does not hold for the chiral fields .",
    "coherent oscillations are not damped , and the lack of chemical processes , both in the quarks and the fields , does not allow for a consistent description of a dynamical phase transition .    to treat this problem , we developed a method to allow a kinetic and discrete monte - carlo like interaction between particles and classical fields .",
    "as a proof of concept we have demonstrated that a consistent mapping between the classical and continuous equations of motion for a harmonic oscillator coupled to a langevin force can be established .    as the next step , we will apply this simulation method to the full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional linear @xmath0-model , which will finally enable us to treat chemical reactions between the quarks and the chiral fields consistently within our vlasov - boltzmann dynamics .",
