    "exhibit highly specific plasmonic properties : the resonant values of the metal permittivity are determined by the geometric parameters of the corners  the apex angle and the curvature radius.@xcite a similar behavior was predicted for 3d particles of smoothed cubic shapes.@xcite generally , as the sharpness increases , the plasmons become superlocalized , i.e. localized on the scale of the curvature radius .",
    "the local values of electric field then exceed considerably those in the incident light wave .",
    "solid links between such superlocalized plasmons ( slps ) of metal corners and tips and the optical singularity at perfectly sharp wedges and cones have been established.@xcite    nanosize perturbations of metal surface , both random@xcite and regular,@xcite strongly affect plasmons and their contribution to optical phenomena .",
    "sharp perturbations of a flat metal surface also support slps which admit a relatively simple analysis including determination of plasmonic frequencies and field distributions.@xcite one can expect that a sharp perturbation provides almost the same slp properties whether it is placed on the flat metal surface or on a smooth nanoparticle surface .",
    "however , this expectation comes true only partially and its failure is worthy of attention .",
    "the point is that the frequencies of slps and lps depend on essentially different shape parameters , and for this reason they can eventually be close to each other . in this case , a strong hybridization of large - scale lps with short - shale slps of a nanoparticle can be anticipated .    in this paper , we analyze the slp - lp hybridization and its optical consequences for the simplest unperturbed nanoparticle shapes with non - degenerate lp spectra ( elliptic wires and spherical particles ) and sharp corner- and tip - shaped surface perturbations .",
    "for subwavelength particles , the full set of maxwell s equations reduces in the quasi - static approximation to the laplace equation for the electric potential @xmath0 .@xcite the latter satisfies the conventional boundary conditions including the relative ( to the dielectric background ) complex permittivity @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to transfer from the differential eigenvalue problem for @xmath0 in space to an equivalent integral problem for the surface charge density @xmath2.@xcite in this approach , the plasmonic eigenfunctions @xmath3 obey the integral equation @xmath4 where the eigenvalues @xmath5 are expressed by the real resonant permittivity @xmath6 , the kernels in the 3d case ( nanoparticle ) and the 2d case ( nanowire ) are @xmath7 @xmath8 is the 3d or 2d boundary of the particle , and @xmath9 is the unit vector of the external normal .",

    "is non - symmetric , its eigenvalues are real and its eigenfunctions are mutually orthogonal for the scalar product defined as  @xcite @xmath10 @xmath11 this allows us to normalize @xmath3 as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the surface value of the electric potential induced by the charge density @xmath14 and the brackets denote the surface integral .",
    "note that @xmath15 can be also obtained directly as a solution ( denoted as @xmath16 in ref .  ) of the integral problems",
    "adjoint to eq .  ,",
    "i.e. , with the arguments of the kernels permuted .    considering the particle in an external electric field @xmath17",

    "one can also calculate the normal component of the total electric field above the particle surface and determine its ratio to the external field applied in the same direction : @xmath24}{\\varepsilon_j - \\varepsilon(\\omega ) } \\langle \\phi_j({\\bf r}')\\ { \\bf n}({\\bf r}')\\cdot{\\bf n}({\\bf r } ) \\rangle\\ \\sigma_j({\\bf r}).\\ ] ] the absolute value @xmath25 gives the local light - field enhancement factor .",

    "and that reach their minimum absolute values @xmath27 at the resonant frequencies @xmath28 such that @xmath29 . accordingly , a strong resonant increase of the particle response can be expected if @xmath30 .",

    "quantitatively , the band of high polarizability here is less affected by the perturbation showing a smaller decrease near the avoided crossings .",
    "the difference stems apparently from the weaker lp - slp interaction in the 3d case ( for the same perturbation size ) as the tip - shaped perturbation is localized in all directions .",
    "note that the field enhancement factor here is much higher ( for the same perturbation curvature radius ) and reaches the values of the order of @xmath78 near the avoided crossings .",
    "to clarify the situation when two sharp perturbations are present , we consider a wire of elliptical cross section with a well separated pair of corner - shaped perturbations of the form .",

    "[ tworidges]b and [ tworidges]c .",
    "importantly , the difference in the perturbation height grants a well pronounced spectral isolation of these hot - spots and no interaction between them can be traced from our data .",
    "as we have seen , each small sharp perturbation of the nanoparticle shape supports plasmons superlocalized near the perturbation apex .",
    "their frequencies are determined by the corresponding perturbation shape .",
    "when one of slp frequencies is close to that of the ordinary lps ( localized on the whole particle ) a strong lp - slp hybridization occurs enabling an lp - slp synergy .",
    "the latter is very beneficial for the light - particle interactions : large resonant excitation cross - section of lps is combined with the high local - field concentration in slps . as a result ,",
    "the whole particle plays the role of a nano - antenna that couples free - space light to the nanoscale volume at the top of the perturbation .",
    "when several small sharp perturbations are present , they are generally independent from each other",
    ". accordingly , in real metal nanoparticles with possibly numerous small shape irregularities , only those slps will be selectively excited by light whose frequencies are close to the whole particle lp frequencies and only the corresponding perturbations will contribute to optical phenomena .",
    "the conditions of selective slp excitation are sensitive to the external conditions . by adjusting the background permittivity by 1020@xmath82",
    ", one can vary the local - field values by orders of magnitude ( see figs .",
    "[ abc2d]d , [ abc3d]d , [ tworidges]b , and [ tworidges]c ) .",
    "a similar effect can be achieved by changing the close environment , e.g. by displacing the adjacent nanoobjects .",
    "this paves the way for targeted design of multi - functional nanoscale optical systems based on metal particles with corner- and tip - shaped features .",
    "the chosen three - scale hierarchy of the particle shape , @xmath83 , implying smallness of the perturbations and their sharpness , is crucial for our considerations .",
    "it ensures the compactness of the hybridization regions ( especially in the 3d case ) and huge near - field enhancement near the perturbation apexes .",
    "thus , for example , downgrading to a two - scale shape with @xmath84 results in a dramatic drop of @xmath64 by several orders of magnitude . practically , the chosen scale hierarchy can be realized with the curvature radius of @xmath85  nm , the corner / tip height and width in the range of @xmath86  nm , and the particle size about @xmath87  nm .",
    "finally , the assumed ratio @xmath88 is a good estimate for silver in the visible , gold in the infrared , and aluminum in the ultraviolet.@xcite",
    "plasmon resonances of metal nanoparticles with small sharp shape perturbations are hybrids of plasmons of the two elementary types : the superlocalized plasmons ( slps ) supported of the perturbations and the localized plasmons ( lps ) of the unperturbed particles .",
    "an efficient optical excitation of an slp is possible due to a strong lp - slp hybridization when the slp frequency is close to an lp frequency .",
