    "it has been nearly fifty years since @xcite first proposed that core - collapse supernovae may be driven by neutrino energy deposition in the mantle from neutrinos produced and transported from a gravitationally collapsing core , and most current investigations of the core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion mechanism still center around this idea .",
    "colgate and white s seminal work was followed by increasingly sophisticated one - dimensional ( 1d ) models that eventually included multi - frequency ( spectral ) neutrino transport , the state of the art in weak interaction physics of the day ( the impact of the newly discovered weak neutral currents was part of the important progress made through these models ) , a nuclear equation of state , and general relativistic treatment of gravity @xcite .",
    "the culmination of 1d models was not to occur until almost forty years after colgate and white s original proposal , with simulations that implemented general relativistic boltzmann neutrino transport and hydrodynamics coupled to general relativistic gravity , using state of the art weak interactions and equations of state @xcite .",

    "in we compared the shock trajectories of our 2d models with their 1d counterparts and showed that prior to @xmath3100  ms after bounce these trajectories are quite similar , but thereafter the shock trajectories for the 2d models begin to diverge from their 1d counterparts .",
    "this result echoes many previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "whereas the radii of the 1d models begin to decline after 100  ms , having reached a plateau of about 190  km , the mean shock radii of the 2d simulations begin to increase .",
    "we remarked in on the similarity of the shock trajectories for the different progenitors during the quasi - stationary accretion phase , which lasts until about 150  ms after bounce .",
    "we attributed this to the fact that while the separate factors responsible for the radius of the shock during this phase , as given by equation  ( 1 ) of @xcite , are different for the different progenitors , their combinations are similar ( upper panel of figure  3 in ) .",
    "the expansion of the shock in the 2d models after 100  ms , in contrast to their 1d counterparts , is due to the onset of fluid instabilities below the shock .",
    "here we provide a detailed account of the development of asphericity from convection and the sasi ; the build - up to explosion ; the operation of the explosion mechanism ; the development of explosion energy ; the impact of accretion and large - scale morphology on the explosions ; and the growth and deflection of the proto - ns .",

    "the initial outward propagation of the shock from the core bounce and its subsequent stagnation is followed by a brief period ( @xmath310  ms ) of entropy - driven convection in the proto - neutron star ( proto - ns ) .",
    "after this prompt convection , the region between the proto - ns and the shock enters a period of quiescence during which the competition between neutrino energy emission and deposition establishes a neutrino net heating layer , or ` gain region , ' below the shock and a net cooling layer between the heating layer and the neutrinosphere @xcite .",
    "these two layers are separated by a gain surface at which net neutrino heating is zero .",
    "energy exchange between the neutrino radiation and the fluid is dominated by @xmath8  and @xmath9  absorption on free neutrons and protons , respectively , and the inverse processes .",
    "after the quiescent accretion phase two fluid instabilities , neutrino - driven convection and the sasi , emerge and come to dominate the dynamics below the shock .",
    "one or both of these instabilities cause the mean shock trajectory in multi - dimensional core - collapse simulations to diverge from those in 1d simulations , and have proven essential for initiating successful neutrino - driven explosions .",
    "a number of early multi - dimensional hydrodynamics simulations demonstrated that neutrino - driven convection does indeed develop in the heating layer and enhances the revival of the shock @xcite .",
    "convectively unstable entropy gradients occur in the heating layer for several reasons .",
    "first , neutrino heating is more intense near the gain surface than at larger distances , due to geometric dilution and absorption of neutrinos propagating outward .",
    "second , material advecting towards the gain surface is continually heated by neutrinos , gaining entropy as it moves inwards .",
    "convective flows enhance the effective neutrino heating efficiency because rising fluid elements have lower neutrino emissivities after adiabatic expansion , reducing losses due to neutrino cooling .",
    "reynolds stresses associated with convection also push the shock outward @xcite thereby reducing the pre- and post - shock velocities and increasing the residence time of matter in the heating layer . after the shock begins to propagate outward , asphericities in the shock surface funnel inflowing matter into accretion streams that reach the proto - ns and maintain the accretion luminosity while delivering material to be heated in the convective , or buoyant , heating cycle .",
    "these effects of multidimensional flows , including the continued accretion power after shock expansion starts , are not possible in 1d simulations and are likely the most important reason multidimensional models achieve explosions where 1d models do not .    the second important fluid instability is the sasi , the tendency of the accretion shock to undergo non - radial low - mode ( dipole , quadrapole , etc . ) deformations , even in the absence of a negative entropy gradient .",
    "this instability was discovered numerically by @xcite and has been investigated further by @xcite .",
    "low mode , non - spherical shock deformations that result from this instability during the period after shock stagnation increase the mean shock radius and deflect post - shock flows laterally , increasing the advection time of matter through the heating layer .",
    "furthermore , the low - mode core deformations get frozen in when the shock propagates outward and can potentially explain observed asymmetric explosion geometries and neutron star kicks @xcite .",
    "development of convection in the gain region , through which matter is continually flowing , requires that a given fluid element spend enough time in the gain region , relative to the convective growth timescale , for a perturbation to be sufficiently amplified to resist being swept through the gain surface into the cooling layer .",
    "@xcite found that the conditions for the onset of neutrino - driven convection requires that the quantity @xmath29",
    "\\frac{dr}{\\left| \\bar{v}_{\\rm r } \\right| } \\label{tadv_tconv}\\ ] ] exceeds a value of about 3 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33  are , respectively , the angle averaged gain radius , shock radius , radial velocity , and brunt - visl frequency ( unstable if positive ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 can be thought of as the ratio of the advection timescale , @xmath27 , to an average timescale for the growth of convection , @xmath28 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath34 signaling conditions favorable for the onset of neutrino - driven convection will depend on the magnitude and nature of the fluid perturbations .",
    "we evaluated @xmath34 numerically from equation  ( [ tadv_tconv ] ) for each of our models and plotted the results in figure  [ fig : early]a .",
    "the convective threshold @xmath35 is reached for each model about 70  ms after bounce . between 70 and 100  ms after bounce",
    ", @xmath34 rises to between 4 and 5 for the two less massive progenitors , but for the two more massive progenitors @xmath34 stays between 3 and 4 , and in the case of b25-wh07 @xmath34 barely rises above 3 .",
    "thus , less massive progenitors should be more prone to the growth of neutrino - driven convection in the heating layer 70100  ms after bounce than the more massive progenitors . that this is indeed",
    "the case can be seen in the entropy and radial velocity maps of the shocked regions at 85  ms after bounce ( figure  [ fig : entropy ] ) .",
    "convection is well developed in model b12-wh07 and is progressively less developed with increasing progenitor mass through model b25-wh07 , where convective activity is barely discernible at 85  ms after bounce .",
    "the differences in the advection to convection ratios can be understood using quantities plotted in the other panels of figure  [ fig : early ] .",
    "the advection timescales through the gain region ( figure  [ fig : early]b ; solid lines ) generally decrease with increasing progenitor mass between 70 and 130  ms after bounce .",
    "the advection time is a function of the advection velocity through the heating layer and width of the heating layer . for our simulations",
    ", the advection velocity increases with the progenitor mass .",
    "the models for more massive progenitors have higher mass accretion rates ( figure  [ fig : early]c ; dot - dashed lines ) , due to denser pre - collapse outer iron cores and silicon shells .",
    "the higher mass accretion rates lead to more massive proto - nss , stronger gravitational fields , and larger pre - shock and post - shock infall velocities for similar shock radii .",
    "moreover , the width of the heating layer , the difference between the shock and gain radii ( figure  [ fig : early]c ; solid and dashed lines , respectively ) , decreases with increasing progenitor mass as the models with the more massive progenitors have similar shock but larger gain radii .",
    "the radius of the gain surface is sensitive to the efficiency with which neutrinos radiate away energy delivered by accretion , and models with larger mass accretion rates are less effective at removing the accreted energy , resulting in larger gain radii for the more massive progenitors .",
    "pressure fluctuation power versus time after bounce for all models in modes @xmath36 through @xmath37 computed using equation  ( [ sasi_power1 ] ) .",
    "the blue dashed lines show the volume of the heating layer used in the power computation . ]",
    "the convective growth timescale @xmath28  ( figure  [ fig : early]c ; dashed lines ) is a function of the magnitude of the negative entropy gradient established in the heating layer , which increases with both the strength of the neutrino heating and the time a fluid element resides in the heating layer exposed to neutrino radiation .",
    "both the @xmath8  and @xmath9  luminosities ( figure  [ fig : early]d ; solid and dashed lines , respectively ) and rms energies ( figure  [ fig : early]d ; dot - dashed and short - dashed lines ) increase with increasing progenitor mass , due to the higher mass accretion rates ( figure  [ fig : early]c ; dash - dotted lines ) . compensating for this is the smaller accretion timescales for the higher mass progenitors , as discussed above .",
    "the result is that the convective growth timescales are nearly the same for all of the models . the decreasing advective timescale with increasing progenitor mass , together with the nearly identical convective growth timescales , results in a decreasing @xmath26 with increasing progenitor mass , and the tendency for the onset of convection to be progressively delayed with increasing progenitor mass .      to provide evidence for the operation of the sasi in our models , which should manifest itself globally , we plot in figure  [ fig : mode_power ] the time evolution of the total power in the first six legendre modes of the pressure fluctuations .",
    "the pressure fluctuation power is computed from the volume integral of the fractional variation of the pressure from its angular mean between the mean neutrinosphere radius @xmath38  and the mean shock radius @xmath31  as suggested by @xcite , @xmath39^{2 } , \\label{sasi_power1}\\ ] ] where legendre amplitudes @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "the power in the lower modes , particularly @xmath36 and @xmath43 , becomes appreciable at @xmath3100  ms after bounce for all models , slightly earlier for b15-wh07 and b20-wh07 .",
    "model b12-wh07 shows sasi - like oscillations characterized by several sign reversals of all odd modes with intervals of @xmath320  ms ( similar to the period reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and exhibits a persistent growing quadrupole ( @xmath43 ) deformation .",
    "the dipole deformation eventually becomes dominant after about 200  ms .",
    "the other models also show growing power in the lower legendre modes but do not exhibit repeated sign reversals .",
    "models b15-wh07 and b25-wh07 both have a sign reversal of the odd modes at about 130  ms after bounce , with the former showing a second and broader collective dip in the odd modes at @xmath3170  ms after bounce .",
    "the suppression of the low - mode sasi oscillations is caused by the buoyancy of large , high - entropy bubbles that form in the expanding lobes of material behind the shock , which inhibit their recontraction @xcite .",
    "after @xmath3200  ms , the modes in all models appear to have become non - oscillatory , and , with the exception of b20-wh07 , appear to be growing in proportion to the heating layer volume , while at the same time preserving their relative strengths .",
    "this reflects the fact that the comoving shock and gain region pattern relative to the origin in these models has been frozen in at this time  i.e. , @xmath44 in equation  ( [ sasi_power1 ] ) . for model b20-wh07 ,",
    "the mode power after @xmath3200  ms becomes almost constant , rather than increasing with the heating layer volume .",
    "this is a consequence of the off - center and more sphere - like explosion geometry of this model ( discussed further in section  [ sec : morphology ] ) causing the shock to have a more spherical shape relative to the center of the grid with time .",
    "the legendre mode power therefore declines with time relative to the heating region volume . for all of the models ,",
    "the oscillatory character of the low legendre modes switches to one of non - oscillatory growth with thermal runaway in the gain region and shock revival , as we discuss in the following sections .",
    "there is also qualitative evidence of the sasi in our simulations .",
    "a pattern of pole reversals in the radial velocity behind the shock is visible in the animated version of figure  [ fig : entropy ] for the b12-wh07 model with positive radial velocities behind the shock at one pole and negative radial velocities just below the shock at the opposite pole .",
    "this pattern reverses polarity concurrently with the sign changes in the @xmath36 coefficient of the pressure fluctuation power ( figure  [ fig : mode_power]a ) at 150 , 170 , and 185  ms .    it is tempting to find a parallel between the character of the fluid instabilities that first appear in the gain region after shock stagnation in our models , and the timing of the instabilities found by @xcite in their models u8.1 ( 8.1  @xmath0 ) and s27 ( 27  @xmath0 ) .",
    "they present detailed arguments to substantiate the fact that convection appears to arise first in the less massive model u8.1 , while the sasi precedes convection in the more massive model s27 . the much larger mass accretion rate through the gain surface of their model s27 , as compared with their model u8.1 , inhibits convection while being conducive to the onset of the sasi .",
    "our models do indeed exhibit a delay of convective activity that correlates with their mass , as discussed above , but we have not been able to adduce strong evidence of the sasi preceding convective activity in any of our models . a comparison of the ratio of advection to convection timescales @xmath34 ( figure  [ fig : early]a ) for our simulations with @xmath34 for their models ( figure  10 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that their model s27 exhibits a considerably greater delay before @xmath34 attains the critical value of 3 than is the case for any of our models .",

    "asphericity in the shock from the sasi and neutrino - driven convection focus the accretion into streams , which we have illustrated in figure  [ fig : stream ] for b15-wh07 at 225  ms after bounce using the entropy with velocity vectors in the accretion flow .",
    "the pre - shock accretion is radial and the entropy is below 4  @xmath45 , where @xmath46  is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the shock jump conditions require that the passage of the accretion flow through the shock reduces the flow s velocity and increases its density and temperature .",

    "( the rising buoyant neutrino - heated plumes have entropy larger than @xmath310  @xmath45 . )",
    "the shock jump conditions imply that the infall velocity component normal to the shock surface , but not the component(s ) tangential to the shock surface , are reduced when passing through the shock . in the supernova accretion shock , the unaltered tangential component of the incoming velocity results in a post - shock boundary layer flowing from positions with large shock radii toward those with small shock radii . in this example",
    ", the post - shock accretion material flows from both poles toward the shock minimum near the equator , forming a shock triple point . at a triple point",
    ", the shock surface can be very steep and nearly tangent to the radial inflow .",
    "the large component of the infall velocity tangent to the shock near a triple point leads to small decrements in the inflow speed at the shock such that the post - shock flow can be supersonic as illustrated in figure  [ fig : stream ] ( red ; lower panel ) .",
    "high - velocity and supersonic accretion streams forming at shock triple points have been discussed in 2d and 3d sasi simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "convection can also produce large lobular distortions of the shock and associated local shock minima that focus accretion into streams . together",
    "they make accretion streams ubiquitous in 2d ccsn simulations . because the tangential component of the velocity at the shock is not altered by the jump conditions , less kinetic energy is thermalized at the shock and is therefore available for delivery to the proto - ns , where it can contribute to eventual neutrino heating .",
    "thus , not only do multi - d simulations allow simultaneous accretion and shock expansion , but the accretion streams themselves frequently are , or become , supersonic .",
    "these supersonic accretion streams form secondary shocks at the proto - ns surface and thereby deposit considerable thermal energy , much of which adds to the neutrino luminosity . to the left of the equator in figure  [ fig : stream ] we can see a second accretion stream that is being cut off from the direct flow of accreted material from the shock . during the simulations accretion streams are cut off and new ones form until the radial velocity becomes positive throughout the post - shock layer and no more accreted material is directed into the streams .",

    "as the shock continues to move outward into lower density matter , energy gain by @xmath8  and @xmath9  absorption on free nucleons begins to dominate over energy loss by the inverse emission processes , and the radius of the gain surface begins to move inward relative to the shock , causing a heating layer to form and widen ( see figure  [ fig : early]c ) .",

    "figure  [ b12_b25_heating]a shows that the heating efficiencies of the models rise from essentially zero to about 10% at the same time that the heating layer is forming , for the obvious reason that the presence of a heating layer is integral to the definition of @xmath47 . once the heating layer has formed , the subsequent behavior of @xmath47 reflects a competition between ( 1 ) the decreasing density of this layer , which reduces the absorption opacities and hence the magnitude of @xmath47 , as the mass accretion rate and pre - shock density decrease with time , and ( 2 ) the effect of convection and the sasi in moving the shock out and increasing the volume of this layer , together with the contraction of the neutrinospheres , shown in figure  [ b12_b25_heating]b , with the consequent rise in the neutrino luminosities and rms energies ( figure  [ fig : early]d ) .",
    "the competing effects on @xmath47 almost balance at this time , and the heating efficiency increases slowly , from about 70  ms to about 160  ms after bounce .",

    "we account for the negative valued gravitational energy influxes in these percentages by maintaining the ratio of the kinetic energy and enthalpy influxes while scaling them so that their sum was that of the total energy influx ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "as is evident from figure  [ fig : b12_b25_source_summary ] , for all models enthalpy influx is the dominant source of energy into the analysis volume regardless of the choice of lower boundary .",
    "the relative contribution of direct neutrino heating increases for smaller @xmath158 as would be expected .",
    "the relative contribution of the other two sources , kinetic energy influx and nuclear heating , are only mildly dependent on @xmath158 . both exhibit a modest decrease with decreasing @xmath158 , except for the nuclear heating in model b12-wh07 , where the decrease is large .",

    "the overall morphology of the shock has an impact on the development of the explosion and , in particular , we believe that the difference in morphology for b20-wh07 relative to the other models helps explain its lower explosion energy .    from the mean , maximum , and minimum shock radii of the models ( figure  [ fig : shape]a ) , it is clear that the shock has been revived and explosions are developing for all models by @xmath3200  ms after bounce as was discussed in section  [ sec : expl_onset ] and .",
    "by @xmath3300  ms , the shocks in all of the models are expanding at a fairly steady pace and mean shock radii larger than 10000  km are eventually achieved in all of these simulations .",
    "a simple measure of the shock morphology is the shock deformation parameter @xmath162  defined by @xcite as @xmath163-\\min[{\\ensuremath{r_{\\rm shock}(\\theta)}}\\cos\\theta]}{2\\times \\max[{\\ensuremath{r_{\\rm shock}(\\theta)}}\\sin\\theta]}-1 . \\label{shock_deformation}\\ ] ] irrespective of the location of the origin , prolate , oblate , and spherical shock geometries are characterized by positive , negative , and vanishing values of @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "it is evident from the history of @xmath162  plotted in figure  [ fig : shape]b that the shock geometries in all models , with the exception of model b20-wh07 , develop a distinctly prolate structure at the onset of the explosion that is maintained throughout expansion .",
    "model b20-wh07 , by contrast , remains roughly spherical in shape for hundreds of milliseconds after the explosion develops , and only starting at @xmath3800  ms after bounce does a prolate shock geometry ( @xmath164 ) distinctly develop .",
    "we suspect that the tendency of the shocks in our models to assume a prolate shape ( eventually , in the case of b20-wh07 ) is , at least in part , a consequence of imposition of axisymmetry with an impenetrable polar axis ( reflecting boundary condition ) that forces flows converging at the pole to be directed either radially inwards or outwards along the poles .",
    "the trend of increasing diagnostic energy with progenitor mass evident in our models ( figure  [ expl_e_vs_t_12m_25m_comp]a ) is broken by b20-wh07 , which has a relatively low diagnostic explosion energy @xmath71 , between those of models b12-wh07 and b15-wh07 , rather than between b15-wh07 and b25-wh07 as the trend would otherwise imply .",
    "the slope of the diagnostic energy versus time for b20-wh07 ( figure  [ expl_e_vs_t_12m_25m_comp]a ) initially matches the slopes of its neighbors in mass , b15-wh07 and b25-wh07 , but the slope declines relative to those models about 300  ms after bounce , while the @xmath71  growth rate for b15-wh07 declines only after 600  ms and there is no abrupt flattening of the @xmath71  curve for b25-wh07 through 1400  ms after bounce .",
    "this relatively early decrease in @xmath71  growth rate for b20-wh07 seems tied to the morphology at the shock , particularly the nature of the accretion streams delivering material directly from the shock to the proto - ns .",
    "accretion streams can be seen in the low - entropy , negative - radial - velocity streams inward from the shock , shown in figure  [ b12_b25_entropy_250_tb ] at 250  ms after bounce , just after shock revival .",
    "the three models with the systematic trend in diagnostic energy , b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , and b25-wh07 , show a pronounced prolate shock structure with well - defined accretion streams inward from the shock .",
    "the shock shape for model b20-wh07 is more spherical , though off - center , than prolate .",
    "none of the down flows are being fed directly from newly shocked material , as a shell of material behind the shock , more than 100  km thick and moving outward , cuts off direct flow into the accretion streams by 240  ms after bounce . a similar transition to outward velocities behind the entire",
    "shock occurs more than 100  ms later for the other models , at about 370 , 500 , and 410  ms after bounce , respectively , for b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , and b25-wh07 .",
    "the mass accretion rates through the gain surface ( figure  [ fig : heat]c ) also confirm the mass accretion suggested visually by figure  [ b12_b25_entropy_250_tb ] .",
    "the mass accretion rate through the gain surface of model b20-wh07 falls to less than half that of the other models between 250 and 450  ms after bounce .",
    "because a significant fraction of the @xmath8  and @xmath9  luminosities at this time are generated by the gravitational energy released by the accretion of mass through the gain surface and neutrinospheres , it would be expected that the luminosities for model b20-wh07 show a significant decline at this time , relative to those of the other models .",
    "this is reflected in the luminosities of all neutrino species ( figure  [ fig : lumin ] ) .",
    "the @xmath8  and @xmath9  luminosities for model b20-wh07 do indeed show a significant decline during the 250450  ms interval , falling below those of b15-wh07 and almost to the level of b12-wh07 .",
    "we thus attribute the relatively low diagnostic energy of model b20-wh07 to a post - shock envelope structure that has been frozen at the time of shock revival and has inhibited the accretion streams and mass accretion through the gain surface ( figure  [ fig : heat]c ) and neutrinospheres relative to the other models at this critical time .",
    "these morphological differences in model b20-wh07 and their impact on the development of the explosion seem to be initiated by the growth of a large plume on the north , or right , pole of the simulation that spreads into the equatorial region just before the revival of the shock .",
    "this can be seen in the animation of figure  [ fig : entropy ] .",
    "this event seems to be the result of a stochastic variation in the growth of the buoyant plumes rather than related to any feature of the progenitor . confirming this supposition will require further examination as the available number of 2d simulations grows .",
    "note also in figure  [ fig : heat]c the very significant decline , by almost an order of magnitude , in the mass accretion rate of model b12-wh07 relative to the other models , beginning at @xmath3600  ms after bounce .",
    "this b12-wh07 mass accretion rate trough is the result of both the original lower density oxygen - rich layer being advected to the gain surface and the temporary choking off of the down flows .",
    "this accretion rate trough is correlated with the very slow growth of the explosion energies for this model beginning at this time ( figure  [ expl_e_vs_t_12m_25m_comp]a ) .",
    "these examples of the connection between mass accretion and the growth of the explosion energy are illustrative of an important aspect of the multidimensional dynamics of the neutrino - driven supernova mechanism precluded in spherical symmetry  mass accretion in streams can continue to deliver thermal energy to the proto - ns and enhanced neutrino emission by the release of the gravitational potential energy as the matter accretes on the proto - ns , thereby continuing to pump energy into the developing explosion . any inhibition of these accretion streams will be reflected in a slower growth of the explosion energy as seen in b20-wh07 .       rest mass ( a ) and velocity ( b ) of the proto - ns and inputs to the proto - ns velocity ( c ) for all models plotted versus time after bounce in the colors used in figure  [ fig : early ] . the velocities in panel  b are calculated by assuming momentum conservation ( equation  [ v_ns_mom_cons ] ; solid lines ) or by integrating the external forces acting on the proto - ns ( equations  [ accel_sources ] & [ v_ns_accel ] ; dashed lines ) .",
    "contributions to the velocity of the proto - ns by each term in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ accel_sources ] ) plotted in panel  c are : the gravitational force on the proto - ns by the matter exterior to it ( solid lines ) ; transport of momentum to and from the proto - ns ( dashed lines0 ; and pressure on the surface of the proto - ns ( dot - dashed lines ) . ]",
    "the proto - ns baryonic rest masses , @xmath165 , are plotted as a function of time in figure  [ b12_b25_ns_vs_tb]a , and are 1.461 , 1.676 , 1.806 , and 1.898 @xmath0  ( table [ tab : outcomes ] ) , respectively , for b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , b20-wh07 , and b25-wh07 at the time of this report , where we have defined the proto - ns as the matter with densities above @xmath166  @xmath19 .",
    "the baryonic masses can be translated to gravitational masses , @xmath167 , with the relation @xmath168 with the constant fit a wide range of eoss by @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath167 of 1.345 , 1.506 , 1.611 , and 1.685  @xmath0  for b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , b20-wh07 , and b25-wh07 , respectively .",
    "proto - ns growth is strong in the pre - explosive phase , but the growth rate drops sharply as the accretion rate from the infalling core decreases and matter passing through the shock increasingly becomes included in the outward flow , as is shown by the increasing mass of the gain region in figure  [ b12_b25_gain]a . from 300",
    "ms , when the shock is already launched , to 1200  ms after bounce , the proto - ns rest mass grows by 0.0226 , 0.0644 , 0.0160 , and 0.0443  @xmath0  for models b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , b20-wh07 , and b25-wh07 , respectively . the low growth rate of the b20-wh07 proto - ns mass also corresponds to the reduced accretion and reduced build up of explosion .",
    "( see section  [ sec : morphology ] . )",
    "another feature of the proto - nss in our models , evident from the gain surface accretion rates ( figure  [ fig : heat]c ) , is the lack of the so - called neutrino - driven wind phase , where mass accretion onto the proto - ns is replaced by a low - density , outward flowing wind from the proto - neutron star surface , driven by neutrino energy deposition .",
    "mass accretion through the gain surface at 0.010.1  @xmath114  is still occurring at the time of this report .",
    "there is some evidence of the increased entropy symptomatic of the neutrino - driven wind , but only for some latitudes , with accretion dominating overall .",
    "it has been established @xcite that neutron star velocities in the range of observations can be generated by the anisotropic mass ejection that arises naturally from fluid instabilities in simulations of neutrino - driven ccsne . since the proto - nss in chimera  models are tied to the origin and can not move when exchanging momentum with the surrounding gas , we compute the proto - ns velocity by two previously used methods .    in the first method , we assume conservation of linear momentum and compute the proto - ns velocity from the negative of the total linear momentum of the ejected gas @xcite , @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the velocity of the proto - ns and @xmath171 is the gas momentum integrated over the computational grid exterior to the proto - ns , where @xmath172 is the baryonic mass of the proto - ns star ; @xmath173 is a fiducial radius ( chosen to be 100  km ) inside which essentially all of the momentum transfer between neutrinos and matter occurs ; and @xmath174 is the surface of the computational grid .",
    "there is a neutrino contribution to the momentum given by @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the neutrino momentum integrated over the computational grid exterior to the proto - ns plus the neutrino momentum radiated out of the grid .",
    "this contribution is small and we do not include it further . from equation  ( [ v_ns_mom_cons ] ) we find the evolution of the proto - ns velocities plotted with solid lines in figure  [ b12_b25_ns_vs_tb]b .",
    "the second method involves computing the acceleration of the proto - ns by summing up all the forces acting upon it , and integrating with respect to time to compute the velocity @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath177 and then @xmath178 the proto - ns star velocities as a function of time for our models , computed from equations  ( [ accel_sources ] ) and  ( [ v_ns_accel ] ) using a fiducial radius @xmath179100  km for evaluation of the forces , are plotted in figure  [ b12_b25_ns_vs_tb]b with dashed lines .    for three of the models ( all but b12-wh07 ) the proto - ns velocity magnitude declines towards the end of the simulation .",
    "the velocity contributions from the three forces in equation  ( [ accel_sources ] ) are plotted in figure  [ b12_b25_ns_vs_tb]c . the dominant contribution to the proto - ns velocity",
    "is the gravity term , which is partially canceled by the momentum transport term , indicating that the dominant process giving rise to the proto - ns velocity is anisotropic mass loss with similar velocities .",
    "the cause of the decline in the magnitude of the proto - ns velocity is the continuing accretion of matter onto the proto - ns ( figure  [ fig : heat]c ) and the onset of mass ejection from the opposite pole from that which occurred at earlier times .",
    "it is gratifying to note that both methods of computing the proto - ns kick velocities yield similar velocities as a function of time , as it indicates that chimera  conserves linear momentum to good accuracy , despite not constructing the gravitational potential in chimera  to explicitly conserve linear momentum .",
    "the final proto - ns velocity has only been attained for model b12-wh07 , which has a final computed velocity of @xmath3100  @xmath180 . for the remaining three models we can only suggest that models b15-wh07 and b20-wh07 will have final velocities of @xmath3100200  @xmath180  and model b25-wh07 will have a final velocity of @xmath3500  @xmath180 .",

    "in this section we compare the results of our simulations with observations of ccsn explosion energies and synthesized @xmath4 mass , @xmath181 , as a function of progenitor mass .",
    "ultimately , the physical fidelity of simulations is judged in two ways .",
    "the first is verification , comparison to known solutions , and in the case of complex problems , to other simulations .",
    "the second is validation , comparison to experiment or observations .",
    "the comparisons in this section provide a measure of the veracity of our simulations .",

    "when possible , measuring the gamma - ray luminosity when the supernova envelope becomes transparent to gamma - rays is preferable ; however , this requires a nearby supernova . the nebular phase of a ccsn is powered by these radioactive decays , and the early nebular - phase bolometric luminosity , when the envelope is optically thick to gamma - rays and all the gamma - ray luminosity can be assumed to be thermalized and re - emitted , provides a minimum of the mass of @xmath4 synthesized @xcite , as a non - negligible portion of the thermalized energy is expended by the work it does on the expanding material @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this method of using the bolometric luminosity of a ccsn during its nebular phase as the `` bl method . ''",

    "we will refer to this method as the  s method . \"",
    "the principal uncertainties in such analyses are the distance to the observed supernova , the extinction of light as it passes through the interstellar medium ( in the host galaxy and the milky way ) , and the date of the explosion .",
    "correlating explosion parameters with the mass of the progenitor adds additional sources of uncertainty .",
    "the progenitor mass of an observed ccsn can best be ascertained if its image can be resolved in archival images of the host galaxy , preferably in images taken with a range of photometric filters .",
    "the publicly accessible hst archive has been particularly fruitful in this regard . to date ,",
    "almost all of the progenitors revealed in pre - explosion images of the location of ccsne have been red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "determining the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) progenitor masses , @xmath183 , from these images then depends on matching the inferred luminosities of these immediate pre - collapse rsgs with stellar evolutionary models leading up to core collapse .",
    "these comparisons depend on all the attendant uncertainties in stellar evolution modeling including those from convective and rotational mixing and reaction rates for advanced nuclear burning stages .",
    "additional uncertainties include the host galaxy distance , progenitor metallicity , extinction corrections for circumstellar dust surrounding the progenitor , which can potentially be destroyed by the x - ray and uv radiation of the supernova , and background subtraction of the light from stars in the progenitor s vicinity .",
    "consistency checks are possible if the progenitor can be determined to be a member of a stellar cluster with a determined age .",
    "this also can work as an alternative method of ascertaining the progenitor mass if the progenitor is in a compact cluster and can not be resolved ( e.g. , sn 2004dj ) .",
    "another method of determining supernova progenitor @xmath183  is to infer the ejecta masses through semi - analytical , or numerical radiation - hydrodynamics , modeling of the bolometric light curves and photospheric velocities .",
    "this requires corrections for estimated mass loss during progenitor evolution and a compact remnant mass estimate .",

    "typically , these models of explosions in rsgs predict significantly higher zams masses than those obtained by direct imaging .",
    "the reasons for this difference are unknown , but the most likely candidates are the assumption of spherical symmetry in the models @xcite , unaccounted inhomogeneity particularly in the outer layers @xcite , and possibly the lack of non - lte and spectral transport @xcite . alternately , the fault could lie in the stellar evolutionary models on which the analysis of direct images relies .",
    "we include results for progenitor masses from these recent radiation - hydrodynamics simulations , in part , to emphasize the uncertainty that persists in deriving zams and ejecta masses .",

    "for the two lighter progenitor models , this smooth decline continues through shock revival , but the two more - massive progenitor models experience a two - fold decrease in accretion rate ahead of the shock over a period of 20  ms , which is about five - fold faster than the previous halving of the accretion rate seen in the two less - massive progenitor models . for b20-wh07",
    "this accretion rate drop begins at 200  ms and for b25-wh07 at 220  ms after bounce .",

    "the fourth code ( castro ) has multi - dimensional transport and does not use the ray - by - ray approximation .",
    "@xcite concluded , from the lack of explosions in their simulations of the same @xcite progenitors used herein , that the ray - by - ray approximation may be enhancing the explosions in the simulations of the other groups by artificially correlating neutrino emission to the overall shock and hot bubble features .",
    "@xcite , in contrast , speculated the opposite  that the ray - by - ray approximation might be inhibiting strong explosions .",
    "here we examine certain aspects of the ray - by - ray approximation , noting , however , that a full examination will have to wait until a single code can compute the full dynamic evolution of the supernova engine with the ray - by - ray approximation and with otherwise identical neutrino transport that does not make the ray - by - ray approximation .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported on the development of a multi - angle , multifrequency , 3d neutrino transport solver . using this solver , they computed the stationary - state neutrino radiation field given a background taken from a 3d supernova simulation and compared it to a stationary state radiation field computed on the same background using a ray - based version of their solver",
    ". @xcite performed a similar study with castro . @xcite and @xcite express concern that the ray - by - ray approximation could alter the triggering of explosions by overheating in regions above the most intense neutrino emissivity .",
    "@xcite found that deviations in the heating rate were somewhat smaller than the luminosity deviations , and the largest deviations were found above the impact points of the accretions streams onto the proto - ns . as this excess heating in the ray - by - ray approximation occurs in strong ( often supersonic ) downflows , the impact on the overall explosion trigger and strength is likely reduced .",
    "we have computed the stationary state neutrino radiation field in the stellar background taken from our b12-wh07 model at 262  ms after bounce .",
    "our stationary state ( figure  [ b12-lum - image ] ; lower panel ) resembles those reported by the other authors , with radially oriented ` streaks ' of neutrinos emerging from the proto - ns , where they decouple at about 50  km .",
    "we can contrast this ` streaky ' field pattern with the actual @xmath8-luminosity field in our simulation at 262  ms after bounce ( figure  [ b12-lum - image ] ; upper panel ) .",
    "we can clearly see that the angular variation varies strongly with radius , which in turn indicates there is rapid temporal variability in the neutrinos emerging from the decoupling region , and _ a priori _ rapid variability in the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic conditions in this region .",
    "a computation of the stationary state radiation field for a _ given _ background will assume that local hydrodynamic and thermodynamic conditions are frozen in , particularly extremal conditions such as hot spots at the bases of accretion plumes .",
    "this will in turn exaggerate the relative angular variations of the neutrino radiation field determined by ray - by - ray and non  ray - by - ray approaches .",
    "the ray - by - ray approach has permitted simulation groups , including ours , to build simulations that include much of the neutrino physics , such as observer corrections in the radial direction and non - isoenergetic neutrino scattering , in 2d and 3d models , but at a price in fidelity that is not yet fully known . to connect ray - by - ray and non  ray - by - ray simulations , and to use both effectively toward understanding the supernova mechanism and its observational consequences , full comparison simulations with each scheme",
    "must be performed _ with the same physics _ , so that the ray - by - ray approximation can be better assessed .",
    "if gauged to be a good approximation , the ray - by - ray approximation can serve us well , as the community moves toward simulations with fully multidimensional transport .",
    "in this paper , we present results for four non - rotating axisymmetric core - collapse supernova simulations , designated b12-wh07 , b15-wh07 , b20-wh07 , b25-wh07 , initialized from progenitors with zero - age main sequence masses of 12 , 15 , 20 , and 25  @xmath0 .",
    "these models , evolved from the main - sequence to the onset of core - collapse by @xcite , were continued by us through core collapse , bounce , and shock revival to explosion with our chimera  code .",
    "our simulations were carried out to 1400  ms after bounce , a long time for such simulations , allowing the explosions to more fully develop .",
    "( model b15-wh07 had to be terminated at 1200  ms after bounce when the shock reached the edge of the grid at 20,000  km . ) some of the important observable outcomes of the simulations are summarized in table [ tab : outcomes ] . because of the length of the simulations , we were able to follow the development of the explosion energies of our models to the point where the explosion energy had nearly saturated for model b12-wh07 , and is increasing at a much reduced rate relative to the first few hundred ms of post - bounce growth for models b15-wh07 and b20-wh07 .",
    "model b25-wh07 clearly requires longer simulation time to finalize its explosion energy and other observable measures .    by @xmath370",
    "ms after bounce , distinct heating and cooling layers have been established behind the stagnated shock in all models , and conditions become favorable for entropy - driven convection in the heating layer . in models from more massive progenitors , greater neutrino heating , favoring convective growth , is more than compensated for by the reduced advection time of material through the heating layer , which suppresses convective growth , thus convection takes longer to become fully developed . by @xmath3100  ms after bounce , convection and the sasi push the shock outward relative to 1d counterparts .",
    "these instabilities cause the shock to undergo dipole and quadrupole distortions , the heating layer to expand , and the residency time for material in the heating layer to increase . increased @xmath8  and @xmath9  rms energies from the shrinking neutrinospheres and expansion of the gain region more than compensate for the density decline in the gain region , therefore the neutrino heating efficiencies slowly increase during the build up to explosion .",
    "most importantly , the ratio of the advection time scale to the heating time scale in the gain region increases , exceeding unity by @xmath3100  ms and 3 by @xmath3150  ms after bounce in each of our models , signaling the potential for thermal runaway .",
    "the mass of the heating layer , which initially decreases after formation of the gain region , grows as convection and the sasi push the shock out , providing another indication that thermal runaway is imminent .",
    "the mean , maximum , and minimum shock radii for all models grow rapidly starting at @xmath3200  ms after bounce , indicating that explosions are developing . with the exception of model b20-wh07",

    "we find that much ( @xmath360% ) of the growth of the explosion energy arises from the enthalpy influx upward through the lower boundary  the advection of neutrino heated and dissociated material into @xmath115 from below  and that this dominance of the enthalpy influx is maintained when the lower boundary of @xmath115 is varied between 200 and 350  km .",
    "we find only a relatively modest amount of the explosion energy comes from direct neutrino heating of already unbound material , or by the influx of kinetic energy .",
    "the nuclear energy release is also relatively modest , and occurs by nucleon and @xmath13-particle recombination , silicon burning , and oxygen burning , in sequence , as the shock propagates first through the silicon layers and then through the oxygen - rich layers of the progenitor .",

    "we demonstrate that assessing observable quantities requires the end of significant accretion onto the proto - ns and thus lengthly simulations that increase in simulated post - bounce time with progenitor mass .",
    "future simulations that capture fully developed explosions must be of similar duration and the computed domain must be of adequate size to contain the shock throughout , as illustrated by the premature termination of our b15-wh07 simulation",
