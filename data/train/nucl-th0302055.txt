    "in a series of papers @xcite it has been demonstrated that the lit technique allows a convenient calculation of inclusive photoreaction cross sections wherein final state interactions are fully included .",
    "further , the technique has been extended @xcite to exclusive reactions .",
    "a merit of the technique is that the calculation of continuum wave functions is avoided .",
    "in fact the differential equations to be solved are inhomogeneous and have solutions bounded at infinity .",
    "the work cited above is based on non - relativistic quantum mechanics and a nucleons - only subspace .    in order to treat meson photoproduction from nuclei",
    "it is desirable to see if the lit technique can be extended to a larger subspace i.e. one including nucleons and mesons .",
    "this would enable the full inclusion of both meson - nucleon and nn interactions in the production calculations .",
    "as a test we consider inclusive photoproduction of low energy ( @xmath1 mev ) @xmath0 mesons from deuterium . a traditional calculation of this process was reported by dressler , macdonald , and oconnell@xcite and by gupta , anand , and bhasin @xcite .",
    "both of these groups employed a simple yamaguchi potential @xcite with parameters chosen to account for deuteron binding and low energy nn scattering properties .",
    "we adopt this model with the parameters used in @xcite .",
    "thus this example attempts to apply the lit technique in the nn@xmath2 subspace where for simplicity only an nn interaction is included .",
    "although no @xmath3n scattering is contained in this model , this is not essential for testing the method .",
    "our results will show that it is indeed possible to apply the lit method to this problem and to extract the total photoproduction cross section .",
    "we should point out that our restriction to a simple nn potential for this test calculation does not modify these conclusions .",
    "this is clearly seen from the series of papers @xcite where a range of nn potentials , from simple phenomenological models to modern realistic potentials , have been used in 3-nucleon and 4-nucleon problems . in no case",
    "did the complexity of the nn potential model have any effect on the accuracy or implementation of the lit technique . with assurance that the formalism works the addition of a meson - nucleon interaction",
    "can be viewed as a technical point , the consequence of which would be more complicated numerics .",
    "low energy photoproduction is described by the kroll - ruderman @xcite operator @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the incident photon momentum and polarization vectors , respectively , and @xmath7 denotes the meson field operator @xmath8\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 the energy of the meson and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the usual creation and annihilation operators . here",
    "@xmath12 is the positive elementary charge , @xmath13 is the @xmath0-meson mass , @xmath14 is the @xmath2-n coupling constant , @xmath15 denotes the pauli spin matrix vector and @xmath16 the isospin operator .",
    "@xcite show that the kr term gives nearly the entire cross section for pion energies in the range considered here .",
    "due to cancellations other terms in the production operator i.e. terms required by gauge invariance , do not contribute significantly at low pion energies . with @xmath17 as the incident c.m .",
    "energy the response function @xmath18(@xmath17 ) for this process is @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the deuteron ground state with polarization @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:3 ] ) above @xmath24 denotes the wave function of the relative motion of the @xmath25 system with energy @xmath26 , and @xmath27 indicates an integration over all relative momenta and a sum over all final nucleon spins .",
    "the inclusive cross section is related to @xmath28 by @xmath29 relative momenta in the final state are taken as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the momenta of the final state neutrons and pion , respectively , and @xmath33 is the total mass @xmath34 with the mass of the neutron @xmath35 . as implied by this separation",
    "we are restricting ourselves to non - relativistic kinematics for both the nucleons and the pion .",
    "this allows the separation of the hamiltonian into jacobi coordinates for the nn@xmath2 three body system . in terms of these quantities",
    "the energy conserving @xmath36-function appearing in @xmath28 takes the detailed form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the reduced two - neutron - pion mass .",
    "finally it is more convenient to use the c.m .  energy above threshold @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of the deuteron .",
    "the lit , referred to hereafter as the transform , of the response function @xmath41 is then defined with @xmath42 as @xmath43 because of the relation of @xmath44 to @xmath45 , a straightforward integration of the above equation would leave the operator @xmath46 depending in a complicated way on the hamiltonian @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we proceed by setting @xmath5 appearing in the operator @xmath48 to a constant arbitrarily chosen `` pseudo - momentum '' @xmath49 . as a result",
    "we introduce a new transform @xmath50 , which depends on @xmath51 and takes the form @xmath52 where the lorentz function @xmath53 is solution of the inhomogeneous equation @xmath54 with @xmath55\\ ,        \\delta ( \\vec p_y - \\vec p_y^{\\ \\prime})\\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the inverse to the transform @xmath56 will lead to a corresponding response function @xmath57 and in turn will yield the correct cross section for @xmath58 .",
    "consequently for each photon energy the calculation of the transform and its inversion must be repeated .    as mentioned earlier",
    "the simple model here only includes an nn potential , i.e. ,  @xmath59 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the meson with respect to the @xmath60 pair appears in @xmath47 as the term proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "meson rescattering could be included by adding to @xmath47 appropriate potentials .",
    "although that would considerably complicate the numerical aspect , it would not affect the question posed here , namely : can the lit be inverted when the response function arises from a particle production process ?",
    "a problem is the slow fall - off of the response function for high @xmath45 values . from the definition of the transform it is clear that the response must behave asymptotically like @xmath62 where @xmath63 in order for the integral to converge . in the case of nuclear photoabsorbtion without pion production the response function falls off very rapidly for increasing @xmath45 resulting in @xmath64 also falling rapidly for large @xmath65 .",
    "inversion then gives an accurate account of @xmath41 over its entire range by calculating @xmath64 for a finite number of @xmath65 values . that the response function for inclusive photoproduction may have a significantly different asymptotic behavior",
    "can be seen from the basic kroll - rudermann @xcite cross - section for @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the nucleon energies , @xmath17 is the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath69 and @xmath70 the fine structure constant .",
    "this cross section approaches a constant for large @xmath17 and the response @xmath28 rises linearly in @xmath17 .",
    "in the next section it will be seen that the pion production response function for a finite nucleus is tempered at large @xmath17 by structure effects .",
    "nevertheless it still rises over a large energy region thereby requiring a different approach for the inversion of the transform .",
    "details of the model and the parameters used are given in the appendix .",
    "there it is seen that the vector @xmath71 can also be labeled by the final neutron - neutron spin and that the response function is therefore a sum of singlet and triplet contributions .",
    "the separable potential used here only has scattering in the spin @xmath72 , isospin @xmath73 channel while the @xmath74 , @xmath73 final state consisting of odd partial waves is non - interacting .",
    "1 shows the transform @xmath56 for the case @xmath75 mev .",
    "one notes that @xmath50 reaches a maximum at @xmath76 mev and then falls very slowly with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "also shown in this figure is the response function @xmath57 for @xmath77 .",
    "the response function behaves similarly to @xmath78 as one would expect since @xmath64 samples @xmath79 mainly from a region centered at @xmath80 .",
    "we note that @xmath57 does not rise linearly with energy as in the case of @xmath66 but falls off slowly with energy after reaching a maximum .",
    "unfortunately , the fall - off of @xmath78 with @xmath65 is so slow and covers such a large energy range that inverting it to obtain @xmath41 over the full range , as was possible in the earlier photoabsorption calculations , is not only very difficult but largely physically meaningless because our model is only valid for non - relativistic mesons .",
    "in fact the present model is only sensible for energies @xmath45 not exceeding approximately @xmath81 mev which corresponds to the maximal pion energy still being non - relativistic . our aim then is to calculate @xmath78 only for the segment @xmath82 mev and then invert it to extract @xmath57 for @xmath45 in the same energy range . since @xmath79 can be calculated directly the error can be easily assessed .",
    "the inversion process we use has already been described in @xcite but a brief account is as follows .",
    "the response function @xmath57 is written as a sum @xmath83 and the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 are determined by fitting @xmath86 to @xmath78 as computed from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : app1])-([eqn : app2 ] ) of the appendix .",
    "note that the threshold behavior @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the total spin , is appropriate to the photoproduction process @xcite and differs slightly from the form used in the earlier photoabsorption calculations .",
    "it turns out however that the quality of fit is nearly independent of which threshold behaviour is used .",
    "2 shows the quality of the fit obtained using @xmath89 . with",
    "the parameters so determined one can calculate the response functions and finally the inclusive cross section . as mentioned earlier this model problem is simple enough that the response functions are easily calculated in the traditional manner @xcite .",
    "3 shows the relative error between the response function as calculated from the lit technique ( @xmath90 ) and the one calculated in the traditional manner . over most of the energy range between @xmath91 mev",
    "the relative error is in the @xmath92 range .",
    "however near the threshold , i.e.  @xmath93 mev the response function tends to zero for @xmath94 and limited numerical accuracy produces an exaggerated relative error in this region .",
    "these effects are too small to be visible in a plot of the cross section however . finally our computed cross section along with data of booth _",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "the results of using the lit technique are indistinguishable from the traditional methods in @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to see the differences in the response functions that occur if one uses transforms calculated in different ranges of @xmath65 .",
    "one expects that because of the nature of the lorentz transform that one should only have to calculate the transform up to @xmath95mev , as was done above , if the response function was only required in the energy range @xmath91 mev . to show this we calculate the transform in four ranges @xmath96 where @xmath97 , and @xmath98mev .",
    "the respective response functions obtained by inverting each of these transforms is denoted by @xmath99 .",
    "5 shows the error in the @xmath100= 20,40,60 mev cases relative to the @xmath100= 70 mev case .",
    "one notes that the @xmath100= 20 mev case only is accurate for energies up to 20 mev , that the @xmath100= 40 mev case has a less than 1@xmath101 error at @xmath45= 40 mev , and that the @xmath100= 60 mev case has only a very small error up to 60 mev .",
    "we have shown that the lit technique can be used to calculate inclusive meson photoproduction cross sections in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "rather than fitting the transform over its entire range as was possible in earlier photoabsorbtion calculations one fits here only the low energy segment to obtain the low energy response functions .",
    "the model calculation used here shows that the response functions thus obtained are as accurate as numerical techniques will allow .",
    "our next step will be to add a pion - nucleon interaction to the hamiltonian in order to take account of pion scattering effects .",
    "the dynamical model of darwish , arenhoevel , and schwamb @xcite would provide a benchmark calculation against which to further check our method .",
    "it would also be of interest to apply these types of calculations to higher @xmath102 nuclei such as @xmath103he , @xmath103h , or @xmath104he .",
    "the lit technique extends readily to these cases as well as being able to handle realistic potentials including coulomb effects .",
    "one should expect to be able to study meson - rescattering effects with realistic nuclear models in a variety of light nuclei .",
    "we would like to thank h.  arenhvel for valuable comments .",
    "all authors acknowledge support from the italian ministery of research ( murst ) . in addition",
    "the work of c.r .  and e.l.t .",
    "is supported by the national science and engineering research council of canada .",
    "for the nn interaction we use the separable model of y.  yamaguchi @xcite , which is a pure @xmath88-wave interaction @xmath105 here the labels @xmath106 and @xmath107 refer to the spin - singlet and spin - triplet parts respectively .",
    "the following more up to date constants for this model have been taken from @xcite : @xmath108 these constants fit the deuteron binding energy , the experimental values for the singlet and triplet scattering lengths and the singlet effective range .    using this separable nn interaction",
    "one obtains for the deuteron ground state @xmath109 and a binding energy of @xmath110 mev .",
    "the lorentz function @xmath111 can be decomposed into its spin components as @xmath112 where @xmath113 with @xmath21 and @xmath114 the deuteron and photon polarization , respectively , and the function @xmath115 is a solution of @xmath116\\ ,    \\tilde{\\psi}^{s}_{m_s}(\\sigma,\\,k_{\\rm p},\\,\\vec{p}_x,\\,\\vec{p}_y )    -      \\lambda_{s}\\,g_{s}(p_x)\\ ,    c^{s}_{m_s}(\\vec{p}_y,\\,\\vec{\\delta } )    & &    \\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\\\\    \\qquad\\qquad   =    \\xi^{s}_{m_s , m_d,\\lambda }    \\ ,    { \\cal f}^{s}_{\\vec{\\delta}}(\\vec{p}_x )    \\quad,\\quad s\\in\\left\\{0,1\\right\\}\\quad ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 we take @xmath118=0.078 .    the constant @xmath119 with respect to @xmath120 is @xmath121^{-1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath122 . in the case of @xmath74",
    "this constant vanishes .",
    "the solution of the lorentz - equation therefore is @xmath123    and the transform @xmath56 is @xmath124",
