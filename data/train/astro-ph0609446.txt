    "mass loss from giants is of great importance to stellar evolution  low - mass stars lose up to 0.2 m@xmath1 on the giant branch .",
    "metal - poor globulars giants can probe metallicity dependances of this mass loss , exposing the universe s chemical enrichment history , and revealing how low - metallicity stars can produce large quantities of dust ( _ e.g. _ @xcite",
    "eight infrared - excessive giant branch stars in 47 tuc were observed in the mid - infrared with the eso la silla 3.6 m and timmi-2 spectrograph .",
    "clear silicate emission is present in v1 , corresponding to a mass loss rate of 10@xmath2 m@xmath1 yr@xmath3 ( estimated using the dusty code  @xcite ) .",
    "this work was published as @xcite .",
    "optical vlt / uves spectra were taken of 47 giant stars in six clusters , shown in fig .  1",
    ", in order to analyse differences between ir - excessive and normal stars at a range of metallicities . at @xmath4 100,000 , these represent some of the highest resolution data ever taken of globular cluster giants .",
    "the h@xmath5 and mid - ir ca ii triplet lines exhibit evidence for mass loss : core shifts of several km s@xmath3 exist in many stars , as does substantial emission .",
    "we are in the process of qualitatively analysing the h@xmath5 lines using the sei code @xcite and various other computational methods .",
    "we will then perform an abundance analysis and attempt to model the chromospheric emission .",
    "spitzer imaging of @xmath0 cen totalling 18.4 hours was taken in six bands from 3.670 @xmath6 m . we will produce the first multi - wavelength atlas of @xmath0 cen in the infrared .",
    "we can then use this to find dust - enshrouded objects in the cluster , and measure their mass loss rates and other characteristics .",
