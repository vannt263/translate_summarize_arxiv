    "structural , kinematical , and chemical properties of old , metal - poor stellar halos of galaxies have long provided valuable information on early formation histories of galaxies , in particular , galaxies in the local group ( lg ) ( e.g. , freeman 1987 ; majewski 1993 ; helmi et al .",
    "1999 ; morrison et al .",
    "2000 ; ibata et al .",
    "for example , the observed correlation between chemical and dynamical properties of galactic halo stars or lack thereof have enabled authors to discuss whether the galaxy was formed by a monolithic collapse within a few dynamical timescales ( eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ; norris & ryan 1991 ; chiba & yoshii 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of galaxy formation based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ( e.g. , bekki & chiba 2000 , 2001 ) have demonstrated that basic physical processes involved in the formation of the metal - poor , old stellar halo in a disk galaxy are described by both dissipative and dissipationless merging of subgalactic clumps and their resultant tidal disruption in the course of gravitational contraction of the galaxy at high redshift : understanding of star formation and chemical evolution histories in subgalactic clumps ( i.e. , progenitors of low - mass dwarfs ) are key for better understanding of the origin of galactic stellar halos .",
    "recently , several authors have extensively investigated the possible physical effects of reionization on galaxy formation , in particular , on star formation histories and physical properties of old stellar populations in low - mass dwarfs ( e.g. , bullock et al 2000 ; gnedin 2000 ; susa & umemura 2004 ; grebel & gallagher 2004 ; willman et al .",
    "some of these studies suggested that suppression of star formation resulting from reionization can be a very important physical process for better understanding the observability and the early star formation activities in dwarfs .",
    "these previous results , combined with those on stellar halo formation via hierarchical merging of low - mass subgalactic clumps ( bekki & chiba 2000 ; 2001 ) , therefore imply that _ the influence of reionization on the formation of dwarf galaxies may be imprinted in the physical properties of old stellar halos in bright galaxies . _",
    "although many observational and theoretical studies in the _ young _ universe have already provided important constraints on the cosmic reionization history ( e.g. , gunn & peterson 1965 ; benson et al .",
    "2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2003 ; santos 2004 ; wyithe & loeb 2004 ) , it remains yet to be explored in the _ present - day _ universe as to ( 1 ) whether old stellar halos of galaxies contain the fossil records of reionization history and ( 2 ) what observations of stellar halos can provide what clues to the possible influences of reionization on galaxy formation processes .",
    "physical properties of metal - poor , old stellar halos in galaxies beyond the lg have been recently investigated by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and large ground  based telescopes ( e.g. , harris et al . 2000 ; gregg et al .",
    "furthermore , recent numerical studies provided some specific predictions on star formation histories of dwarf galaxies under the influence of reionization ( e.g. , susa & umemura 2004 ) .",
    "thus it is quite timely to discuss the above questions based on the comparison between observations and numerical simulations addressing the possible influence of reionization on the properties of galactic stellar halos .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show that wide - field imaging of galactic halos by large ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , suprime - cam on subaru ) can provide vital clues to the possible influences of reionization on early formation history of galaxies .",
    "we first present the results of our numerical simulations and stress how structural and kinematical properties of stellar halos , which are formed from merging of small subgalactic clumps , depend on the epoch of reionization ( @xmath0 )",
    ". we then discuss ( 1 ) the origin of diverse stellar halo properties of galaxies of the lg in terms of reionization effects on halo formation and ( 2 ) the importance of ongoing and future wide - field optical imaging of the halos in better understanding galaxy formation .",
    "possible reionization effects on structural properties of globular cluster systems in disk galaxies are discussed in bekki ( 2005 ) .",
    "we simulate the formation of a milky way sized galaxy halo in a @xmath1cdm universe with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 km @xmath5 @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , and thereby investigate merging / accretion histories of subhalos that can contain low mass dwarfs .",
    "the way to set up initial conditions for the numerical simulations is essentially the same as that adopted by katz & gunn ( 1991 ) and steinmetz & mller ( 1995 ) .",
    "we consider an isolated homogeneous , rigidly rotating sphere , on which small - scale fluctuations according to a cdm power spectrum are superimposed .",
    "the initial total mass ( @xmath8 ) , radius , spin parameter ( @xmath9 ) , and the initial overdensity @xmath10 of the sphere in the standard model are @xmath11 , 30 kpc , 0.08 , and 0.26 , respectively .",
    "initial conditions similar to those adopted in the present study are demonstrated to be plausible and realistic for the formation of the galaxy ( e.g. , steinmetz & mller 1995 ; bekki & chiba 2001 ) .",
    "in addition to this standard models , we investigate models with different @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "we start the collisionless simulation at @xmath12 ( = 30 ) and follow it till @xmath13 ( = 1 ) to identify virialized subhalos with the densities larger than @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the critical density of the universe , at a redshift @xmath16 .",
    "this @xmath14 corresponds to the mean mass denstiy of a collapsed and thus gravitationally bound object at @xmath16 ( e.g. , padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "the minimum number of particles within a virialized subhalo ( @xmath17 ) is set to be 32 corresponding to the mass resolution of 3.8 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "this number of 32 is chosen so that we can find a virialized object at a given @xmath16 in a robust manner .",
    "for each individual virialized subhalo with the virialized redshift of @xmath21 , we estimate a radius ( @xmath22 ) within which 20 % of the total mass is included , and then the particles within @xmath22 are labeled as `` baryonic '' particles . this procedure for defining baryonic particles",
    "is based on the assumption that energy dissipation via radiative cooling allows baryon to fall into the deepest potential well of dark - matter halos .",
    "such baryonic particles in a subhalo will be regarded as candidate `` stellar '' particles to form stellar halos in the later dynamical stage , if the subhalo is later destroyed and baryonic particles initially within the subhalo is dispersed into the galactic halo region .",
    "thus , the present dissipationless models track the formation of stellar halos via hierarchical merging of subhalos , although the models are not adequate to the study of star formation histories in subhalos ( as was done in our previous studies , e.g. , bekki & chiba 2001 ) .",
    "previous theoretical studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet background radiation in a reionized universe can significantly reduce the total amount of cold hi and molecular gas that are observed to be indispensable for galactic active star formation ( e.g. , susa & umemura 2004 ) . in order to investigate this suppression effects of star formation on the final structural properties of the simulated stellar halos",
    ", we adopt the following idealized assumption : _ if a subhalo is virialized after the completion of the reionization ( @xmath0 ) , star formation is totally suppressed in such a subhalo . _",
    "then , hypothetical baryonic particles in the subhalos with @xmath21 @xmath23 @xmath0 will _ not _ be identified as stellar halo particles in the later stage , but those in the subhalos with @xmath21 @xmath24 @xmath0 will be regarded as progenitors of visible stellar halos .",
    "recent wmap ( _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ) observations have shown that plausible @xmath0 ranges from 11 to 30 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) whereas quasar absorption line studies give the lower limit of 6.4 for @xmath0 ( fan et al .",
    "guided by these observations , we investigate the models with @xmath0 = 0 ( no reionization ) , 6 , 8 , 10 , 13 , and 15",
    ". the adopted picture of single epoch of reionization might well be somewhat oversimplified and less realistic ( e.g. , gnedin 2004 ) , however , this idealized model can help us to elucidate some essential ingredients of the reionization effects on stellar halo formation .",
    "all the calculations have been carried out on the grape board ( sugimoto et al . 1990 ) .",
    "total number of particles used in our simulations is 508686 and the gravitational softening length is 0.38 kpc .",
    "we note that later accretion of satellites at @xmath25 is minor in the final structures of the simulated halos at @xmath26 , so the calculation is ended at @xmath27 to obtain the dynamically relaxed halo structures .",
    "we used the cosmics ( cosmological initial conditions and microwave anisotropy codes ) , which is a package of fortran programs for generating gaussian random initial conditions for nonlinear structure formation simulations ( bertschinger 1995 ) . in order to derive 2d distributions of @xmath28band surface brightness ( @xmath29 ) from the simulated density distributions of stellar halos , we assume that the stellar mass - to - light - ratio of 4.0 that is a reasonable value for stars with ages of @xmath30 gyr and metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath31 @xmath32 ( vazdekis et al . 1996 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that the projected radial density profiles of stellar halos depend strongly on @xmath0 in such a way that they are steeper for the models with higher @xmath0 .",
    "this result implies that radial density profiles of galactic stellar halos can contain fossil information on the reionization epoch . the physical reason for this dependence",
    "is described as follows . for the model with higher @xmath0 ( = 15 ) , only subgalactic clumps that are virialized before @xmath0 can have old stars ( i.e. , no suppression of star formation by reionization ) within it .",
    "they merge with one another in the early stage of the galactic collapse to form the first , single massive stellar halo around @xmath33 with a steep density profile resulting from violent relaxation of the merging .",
    "after that , subgalactic clumps that are virialized later than @xmath0 and thus do not contain stellar components merge with and accreted by the first massive halo .",
    "these lately merging subgalactic clumps are highly likely to be destroyed in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "consequently , if these subgalactic clumps contain stars initially within them , they are dispersed into the outer halo region and thus significantly flatten the radial density profile of the stellar halo . for the model with high @xmath0 ( = 15 ) , such later accretion can not flatten the radial density profile of the stellar halo so that it can show a steeper density profile .",
    "structural evolutoin of dark - matter halos due to hierarchical clustering process has already been demonstrated by zhao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and the same process is at work for the @xmath0-dependence of stellar halos in the present study .",
    "figure 2 shows how surface brightness ( @xmath29 ) distributions of galactic stellar halos in the @xmath34 band depend on @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that the model with higher @xmath0 ( = 15 ) shows a sharp edge in its projected light distribution of the stellar halo in comparison with the model with lower @xmath0 ( = 6 ) .",
    "the ratio of the half - mass radius of the stellar halo to that of the dark matter halo is 0.15 for @xmath35 and 0.71 for @xmath36 , which suggests that @xmath0 can control the compactness of the stellar halo distribution of a galaxy .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates that the outer stellar halo ( @xmath37  kpc ) is much fainter in the model with @xmath35 ( @xmath29 @xmath31 @xmath38 mag arcsec@xmath39 ) than in that with @xmath0 = 6 ( @xmath29 @xmath31 @xmath40 mag arcsec@xmath39 ) .",
    "figure 2 furthermore shows that a few stellar substructures can be seen in the outer stellar halo only for the model with higher @xmath0 ( = 15 ) , which implies that the observability of stellar halo substructures ( or inhomogeneity in luminosity distribution ) can also depend on @xmath0 .",
    "irrespective of @xmath0 , the stellar halos have prolate - triaxial shapes that follow the shapes of the dark matter halos in the present dissipationless simulations .",
    "therefore , the @xmath29 distributions of stellar halos depend on from which direction we observed the halos .",
    "it is accordingly noted here that the differences in shapes of stellar halos seen in figure 2 are not due to @xmath0 .",
    "thus the way of radially falling @xmath29 of stellar halos ( i.e. , presence or non - presence of outer sharp edges in @xmath29 ) , compactness of the halos , and the average value of @xmath29 can be regarded as fossil records of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 3 shows that @xmath29 distributions of galactic stellar halos depend on the initial mass densities of galaxies ( @xmath41 ) in the sense that the galactic stellar halo in the model with larger @xmath41 ( = 0.39 ) , shows higher @xmath29 as a whole .",
    "this is because total number of subgalactic clumps that can be virialized well before @xmath0 is larger in the model with larger @xmath41 .",
    "this result implies that if reionization can strongly suppress star formation for subgalactic clumps virialized after @xmath0 , @xmath29 distributions of stellar halos can be remarkably diverse even for galaxies with similar masses ( yet different @xmath41 ) owing to the @xmath41-dependence of the reionization effects .",
    "kinematical properties of stellar halos in the models with a given mass depend weakly on @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the maximum rotational velocity @xmath42 of stellar halos is appreciably larger in the model with @xmath0 = 6 ( @xmath43 km s@xmath44 ) than that with @xmath0 = 15 ( @xmath45 km s@xmath44 ) .",
    "this result of more rotation in the model with smaller @xmath0 is described as follows . for the model with @xmath0 = 6 ,",
    "subgalactic clumps which are virialized at @xmath46 and later merge with the galaxy contain a larger amount of orbital angular momentum .",
    "therefore , the outer halo stars formed from tidal destruction of these clumps can have a larger amount of intrinsic angular momentum after conversion of orbital angular momentum into intrinsic one in the merging processes .",
    "previous observations suggested that the radial density profile ( @xmath47 ) of the galactic stellar halo can be well described as @xmath48 corresponding roughly to @xmath49 in the projected profiles ( e.g. , sommer - larsen & zhen 1990 ; chiba & beers 2000 ) .",
    "considering the present result that @xmath47 of galactic stellar halos in the models with higher @xmath0 ( = 15 ) are as steep as @xmath50 and thus consistent with the observations , we suggest that the origin of the observed steep @xmath47 could be closely associated with reionization effects on the formation of subgalactic clumps of the galaxy at a relatively higher redshift ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "furthermore , the simulated halos with sharply truncated outer distributions in the models with higher @xmath0 suggest that the observed apparently sharp edge in the m31 stellar halo ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ) might well result from such reionization effects .",
    "one of the most remarkable results of previous observations for the m31 stellar halo is that it is dominated by moderately high - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath31 @xmath52 ) populations and shows a high stellar density compared with the galactic stellar halo ( e.g. , durrell , harris , & pritchet 2001 ; reitzel & guhathakurta 2001 ) . the origin of the high metallicity , high - density stellar halo of m31 was discussed in terms of the formation of m31 s bulge via past major merger event ( bekki et al .",
    "we here suggest an alternative scenario that the observed differences in metallicity distributions and structures of stellar halos between the two that have similar masses ( evans et al .",
    "2000 ) can be due to m31 s higher initial densities by which star formation and chemical enrichment proceeded more efficiently before reionization compared with the galaxy .",
    "we also suggest that the physical reason for the observed possible difference in the mean metallicities of stellar halos between m33 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath31 @xmath53 ; brooks et al . 2004 ) and the lmc ( [ fe / h ] @xmath31 @xmath54 ; borissova et al .",
    "2004 ) might well be the same as above for the galaxy - m31 difference .",
    "although observations suggest that structural properties and metallicity distributions of galactic stellar halos in the lg could be quite diverse ( e.g. , durrell et al .",
    "2001 ; alves 2004 ; brooks et al .",
    "2004 ) , it remains totally unclear whether such diversity can be seen in other galaxies beyond the lg .",
    "our simulations showed that physical properties of stellar halos in galaxies can be diverse , partly because initial protogalactic conditions of a galaxy ( e.g. , the mass density ) can determine to what extent reionization can influence star formation histories of subgalactic clumps that form the galaxy . in order to reveal radial structures of stellar halos in galaxies beyond the lg and possible influences of reionization on the halo formation in these galaxies",
    ", we need to conduct wide - field imaging for _ global _ light distributions in galaxies and measure the surface brightness distributions of the halos down to @xmath38 mag arcsec@xmath39 .",
    "for example , if we try to cover the 60kpc@xmath1860kpc halo region for a galaxy with the distance of @xmath31 10 mpc , we need @xmath55 wide - field imaging by a large telescope than can detect low - surface brightness stellar halos .",
    "such wide - field imaging naturally enables us to reveal some stellar halo properties possibly influenced by reionization , such as the outer sharp edges in the surface brightness distributions and the steep radial luminosity profiles .",
    "statistical studies of stellar halo properties by wide - field imaging for galaxies in different environments ( e.g. , clusters vs fields ) can also help us to understand different degrees of reionization effects on the stellar halo formation in different environments , which could result from possible inhomogeneity in reionization processes ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2001 ; wyithe & loeb 2004 )",
    ". this type of observations might well be formidable tasks for 8m - telescopes with wide - field imaging facilities : for instance , a few hour exposure with subaru suprime - cam would reach as deep as 29 mag arcsec@xmath39 in the @xmath34-band with sufficient s / n ratios .",
    "systematic observational studies of stellar halos by such telescopes will enable us to discuss differences in reionization influences on stellar halo formation between different galaxies and thus to understand better the origin of galactic stellar halos .",
