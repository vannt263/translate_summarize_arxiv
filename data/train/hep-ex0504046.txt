    "the magnitude of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath14 is a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a knowledge of its value is crucial to the understanding of @xmath15 violation within the sm , which is underpinned by knowledge of the so - called unitarity triangle ( ut ) .",
    "recent precise measurements of ut angle @xmath16(@xmath17 )  @xcite have focussed attention on @xmath14 , because it determines the side of the ut that is opposite @xmath16 , it directly tests the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism  @xcite for @xmath15 violation within the sm .    to date , inclusive measurements of @xmath14 have been reported by experiments operating on the @xmath7 resonance , namely cleo  @xcite , argus  @xcite , babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite , and by lep experiments operating on the @xmath18 resonance , namely l3  @xcite , aleph  @xcite , delphi  @xcite and opal  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath14 can be extracted from the measured rate of charmless semileptonic @xmath0-meson decays @xmath19 in a kinematic region that has to be chosen to minimise the impact of the large background from the charmed semileptonic @xmath0-meson decays @xmath20 .",
    "one such region is at the endpoint of the lepton momentum spectrum : in the rest frame of the decaying @xmath0 meson , leptons from @xmath21 decays attain a maximum momentum of @xmath22 gev/@xmath2 while for @xmath19 decays the maximum is @xmath23 gev/@xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of partial branching fractions to inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath0-meson decays from the yield of electrons and positrons in six overlapping momentum intervals .",
    "the intervals have lower limits commencing at @xmath24 through @xmath25 incremented in steps of @xmath26 and a common upper limit of @xmath27 , as measured in the centre of mass ( cm ) is equivalent to the centre of mass frame . ]",
    "we use two methods to extract @xmath14 , one that has been standard practice  @xcite ( dfn ) , and one that has been recently developed  @xcite(blnp ) . the dfn method involves extrapolation from a partial to a full branching fraction using the defazio - neubert prescription with given shape function parameters  @xcite followed by a routine to translate the full branching fraction to @xmath14  @xcite . the blnp method in contrast to the dfn method provides a more systematic treatment of shape function effects by incorporating all known contributions , includes power corrections , uses an improved perturbative treatment and directly relates the @xmath28 partial rate to @xmath14 . for both methods we use values for the parameters of the shape function that were determined using the @xmath29 photon energy spectrum measured by belle",
    "@xcite - meson decays in determining the @xmath30-quark shape function or distribution function was first discussed by bigi _ et _",
    "al  @xcite and neubert  @xcite . ] . in the case of dfn",
    "the procedure and measurements are given in ref .",
    "the same procedure was updated with predicted shapes of the @xmath29 photon energy distributions from ref  @xcite to yield values of shape function parameters relevant to the blnp method .",
    "the latter are equivalent to hqet parameters in the shape function scheme  @xcite .",
    "the results reported here are based on data collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric energy @xmath6 collider  @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a three - layer silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath31 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we use 27.0 fb@xmath32 and 8.8 fb@xmath32 integrated luminosity samples taken at ( on ) and 60 mev below ( off ) the @xmath7 resonance energy , respectively .",
    "the on sample consists of 29.4 million @xmath5 events .",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , all variables are calculated in the cm frame .",
    "the procedure for this analysis largely follows that of cleo  @xcite , and consists of examining the spectrum of electron candidates with momentum in the range @xmath33 , which includes both signal and sideband regions .",
    "we initially chose and optimised our selection criteria for the momentum region , @xmath34 .",
    "for ease of explanation we discuss the experimental procedure for this momentum interval and later describe the slight differences in the signal extraction for other momentum intervals .    in the cm frame",
    "the kinematic endpoint for decays of the type @xmath35 , including the non - zero @xmath0 momentum and detector effects , is 2.4 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath36 signal is extracted in the momentum region @xmath34 ( hi ) , while a lower range , from @xmath37 ( lo ) , is examined to evaluate the contribution from @xmath38 , which is then extrapolated to the hi region .",
    "the uncertainty on the fraction of @xmath39 within the hi region is a major source of systematic error for the determination of the branching fraction and @xmath14 . for choosing and optimising selection criteria we use a sample of events containing @xmath40 decays , generated via monte carlo simulation and based on a model described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( isgw2 ) , which predicts the form factors and branching fractions of the many exclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath0-meson decay channels that form the sample",
    ". we also generate samples based on an inclusive @xmath41 model , according to the prescription of defazio and neubert  @xcite , with shape function ( sf ) parameters that correspond to the residual @xmath0-meson mass ; + where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the masses of the @xmath30-quark and @xmath0-meson , respectively . ] and the average momentum squared of the @xmath30-quark inside the @xmath0-meson set to @xmath44 gev/@xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "these values were determined from the photon energy spectrum in @xmath47 decays measured by belle  @xcite . to examine the extent to which our results may vary due to uncertainties in @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we also generate four samples with parameters that define the long and short axes of the @xmath50 contour in the @xmath51 plane , corresponding to @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "to select hadronic events we require the multiplicity of tracks to be greater than four and the primary event vertex to be within @xmath56 cm radially and @xmath57 cm longitudinally from the detector origin .",
    "we make further requirements based on quantities calculated in the cm frame  that the sum of cluster energies in the ecl satisfies @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the cm collision energy , that the visible energy @xmath60 be at least @xmath61 , that the absolute sum of longitudinal track and photon momenta be less than @xmath62 , that the heavy jet mass be either at least @xmath63 or greater than @xmath64 gev/@xmath45 , and that the average cluster energy be less than @xmath65 gev .",
    "we also require that the ratio @xmath66 of the second to the zeroth fox - wolfram moment  @xcite be less than @xmath67 .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed from hits in the svd and the cdc .",
    "tracks are required to pass within a short distance from the interaction point ( ip ) of the @xmath6 collision , where the @xmath0-meson decays promptly . for improved data and mc agreement",
    ", tracks must be within the acceptance of the barrel part of the ecl ; @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the polar angle measured in the laboratory frame with respect to the direction opposite to that of the positron beam .",
    "tracks are identified as electrons on the basis of a matching energy cluster in the ecl , and , subsequently , upon the ratio of ecl - measured energy to cdc - measured track momentum , transverse shower shape in the ecl , ionisation energy loss in the cdc , and the acc light yield  @xcite .",
    "given the track requirements , electrons with momenta in the range @xmath70 are positively identified with a probability of @xmath71% while pions are misidentified as electrons with a probability of @xmath72% , as measured using samples of reconstructed @xmath73 and @xmath74 decays , respectively .    to reduce the contribution of electrons from @xmath75 and @xmath76 decays and photon conversions , our candidate electrons are paired with oppositely charged tracks identified as electrons in the event and rejected if their mass falls within either @xmath75 , @xmath76 or @xmath77 mass windows , defined as @xmath78\\,\\mathrm{gev}/c^2 $ ] , @xmath79\\,\\mathrm{gev}/c^2 $ ] and @xmath80\\,\\mathrm{gev}/c^2 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the photon conversion veto has the additional effect of removing electrons from @xmath81 dalitz decays .",
    "the yields of candidates that do not pass the @xmath75 veto requirement are compared in data and mc to determine a normalisation factor for mc - estimated backgrounds , which are described below .    since the dynamics of the hadronic part of @xmath36 is not well established , it is important that selection requirements retain acceptance over a wide range of @xmath82 ( dilepton invariant mass squared ) in order to minimise model dependence .",
    "additional event requirements are designed to reduce contributions from continuum ( @xmath83 where @xmath84 ) and qed - related processes ( including two photon and tau - pair events ) without introducing a @xmath85 bias . a set of `` energy flow '' variables is formed by grouping detected particles in bins of @xmath86 in @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the particle angle with respect to the candidate electron , and taking the energy sum in each bin . the energy flow in the backward direction @xmath89 is not used , as it is found to disproportionately reduce the acceptance in the low @xmath85 region .",
    "a fisher discriminant , denoted @xmath90 , is constructed from the remaining energy flow variables with coefficients chosen to best separate signal from continuum events .",
    "we also make use of a @xmath30-quark rare decay tag variable , denoted @xmath91 , and calculated as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the charge of the candidate electron , and @xmath94 are the number of tracks identified as positively and negatively charged kaons in an event , respectively .",
    "@xmath91 exploits the presence of lepton - kaon charge correlations evident in @xmath5 events wherein one @xmath0-meson decays via a @xmath95 transition whilst the other @xmath0-meson decays typically via @xmath96 transitions , thereby resulting in , on average , a net strangeness or kaon charge that is correlated to the charge of our candidate electron",
    ". the correlation does not exist in continuum events nor in @xmath5 events that do not involve the @xmath97 transition .",
    "charged tracks are identified as kaons by utilising specific ionisation energy loss measurements made with the cdc , light yield readings from the acc , and time of flight information from the tof . the average kaon identification efficiency and fake rate in the momentum range @xmath67@xmath98 , as measured in the laboratory frame , are @xmath99 and ( @xmath100)% , respectively .    to preserve signal efficiency ,",

    "the cut values are chosen to optimise the figure of merit @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath0 reflect the signal and continuum background expectation , respectively , as estimated from mc events , assuming the branching fraction measured by cleo  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath91 dependent cuts on @xmath90 reduce continuum backgrounds by 97% while retaining 33% of the @xmath106 signal .    to further suppress qed - related continuum backgrounds , the cosine of the angle between the thrust axis of the event and the @xmath107 direction @xmath108 , is required to be less than @xmath109 .",
    "crucially , the thrust axis calculation includes the missing momentum as a component .",
    "missing momentum is calculated as the difference between the momentum of the beams and the sum of the observed track and cluster momenta .",
    "placing a constraint on @xmath108 was found to bias the @xmath85 distribution in signal events less than a constraint imposed on the direction of missing momentum , which has been previously used by cleo  @xcite . the requirement on @xmath108 reduces qed - related continuum backgrounds by 50% with a signal inefficiency of 10% .",
    "the acceptance of the selection requirements as a function of generated @xmath85 for events containing electrons in the momentum interval @xmath34 from @xmath36 decay is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .     for events containing electrons in the region 2.2 - 2.6",

    "we describe below our evaluation of each as well as our procedures for evaluating the associated contributions to the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the continuum contribution is evaluated using the off data set . to account for the small difference in the momentum spectra due to the beam energy difference ( 0.6% ) , the electron momenta in off",
    "data are scaled by the ratio of on to off cm energies .",
    "the yields in off data are then scaled by the factor @xmath111 , determined by the on to off ratio of bhabha event yields in the barrel ecl . as a check of this procedure",
    ", we measure the yields in the momentum range @xmath112 , above the kinematic maximum for @xmath113 events .",
    "the resulting signal of @xmath114 electron candidates is consistent with zero , as expected .",
    "we assign systematic uncertainties based on a mc study of the detector response to bhabha events ( 0.4% ) , and the discrepancy with @xmath115 as calculated , similarly , with dimuon events ( 0.2% ) .",
    "the remaining contributions to background are from @xmath113 events and are estimated using a large monte carlo simulated sample of generic @xmath116 events  @xcite that contains roughly three and a half times the number of @xmath113 events in the on sample . the mc yield due to fakes from charged pions",
    "is corrected for the difference in fake efficiency measured by data and mc samples of @xmath74 decays .",
    "the error on the correction ( @xmath117 ) is assigned as the systematic uncertainty on the yield from pions .",

    "this factor is calculated from a fit of the mc - simulated momentum spectrum of vetoed electron candidates from @xmath75 in @xmath0-meson decays to the equivalent spectrum obtained from the data .",
    "this sample is statistically independent of the final event sample , and , moreover , may not contain neutrinos from primary @xmath0-meson decays , which is the case for events providing fake and secondary backgrounds .",
    "contributions from secondary electrons are assigned systematic errors based on the electronic branching fraction uncertainties and the difference between the mc normalisation calculated as described above and that according to the number of @xmath7 events ( 6% ) .",
    "overall , the latter uncertainty has a less than 0.5% effect on the eventual signal yield .",
    "the spectrum from @xmath118 is modelled using three components : @xmath123 ( hqet  @xcite ) ; @xmath124 ( hqet  @xcite ) ; and higher resonance charm meson states @xmath125 ( isgw2  @xcite ) . to improve the agreement with data , we re - weight the @xmath126 and @xmath124 components according to @xmath85 in order to match spectra generated with world average values of form factors  @xcite .",

    "it has been observed that the kekb collision energy has variations of @xmath132 over time and that this results in a measurable variation of the @xmath0-meson momentum over the running period of our on data sample .",
    "as our monte carlo generator assumes a fixed energy , we apply a shift to the reconstructed momentum in the mc to correct for the difference .",
    "the correction depends on the beam energy measurement in the same run period as our on data set , which is made using a fully reconstructed @xmath0-meson decay sample .",
