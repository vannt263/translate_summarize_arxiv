    "radiation from spin - powered pulsars at x - ray through optical wavelengths consists of thermal and nonthermal components ( see kaspi , roberts , & harding 2004 for a recent review ) . in very young pulsars , with characteristic ages @xmath14 kyr ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pulsar s spin period and its derivative ) , such as the crab pulsar , psr b150958 , and psr b054069 , thermal radiation from the neutron star ( ns ) surface is buried under a powerful nonthermal component from the ns magnetosphere , whose spectrum can be described by a power - law ( pl ) model , sometimes with a slowly varying slope .",
    "the luminosity of the magnetospheric component decreases with pulsar s age faster than the thermal luminosity ( at @xmath17 myr ) , so that the thermal component , with typical surface temperatures of @xmath181 mk , dominates in the x - ray ( and , sometimes , far - uv ) emission from middle - aged pulsars ( @xmath191 myr ; e.g. , psrs b0656 + 14 , b105552 , j0538 + 2817 , vela , and geminga  see pavlov , zavlin & sanwal 2002 ; zavlin & pavlov 2004 ) . old ( @xmath20 myr ) nss cool down very fast ( unless a heating process operates in the ns interiors ) , so that the bulk of their surface radiation is emitted at optical - uv wavelengths .",
    "however , as predicted by virtually all pulsar models , small spots around the ns magnetic poles can be heated up to x - ray temperatures by relativistic particles generated in the pulsar acceleration zones . these polar caps ( pcs )",
    "are too small to be detectable in the optical , but they can be seen in soft x - rays . whether the pc emission can be detected in x - rays , and the bulk surface emission in the optical , depends on the intensity of the magnetospheric component , which is is rather poorly investigated because old pulsars are very faint objects beyond the radio band .",
    "thus , studying the x - ray and optical emission from old pulsars allows one to understand evolution of the magnetospheric radiation at large ages and low spin - down energy losses , constrain the pulsar models through observations of pcs , and constrain the internal heating mechanisms through observations of thermal emission from the ns surface .",
    "similar problems have been addressed in x - ray and uv observations of the nearest millisecond ( recycled ) pulsar j04374715 ( @xmath21 ms , @xmath22 gyr , @xmath23 pc ) .",
    "observations with _",
    "rosat _ and _ chandra _ have shown that its pc emission dominates in soft x - rays , while the magnetospheric radiation is responsible for the hard x - ray tail , at @xmath24 kev ( zavlin & pavlov 1998 ; zavlin et al .",
    "far - uv radiation from this pulsar shows a thermal spectrum , emitted from the bulk of the ns surface with a temperature of @xmath25 mk ( kargaltsev , pavlov , & romani 2004 ) .",
    "however , millisecond pulsars represent a separate class because they were spun up ( recycled ) by accretion in close binary systems .",
    "their spin - down power , @xmath26 , is , as rule , much higher than that of `` ordinary '' old pulsars , which can affect their magnetospheric emission .",
    "heating mechanisms in these rapidly spinning objects can also be quite different .",
    "therefore , ordinary old pulsars deserve a separate investigation .    only two ordinary old pulsars , b1929 + 10 ( @xmath27 s , @xmath28 myr , @xmath29 erg s@xmath3 ) and b0950 + 08 ( @xmath30 s , @xmath31 myr , @xmath32 erg s@xmath3 ) were detected outside the radio band in the pre-_chandra_/  era . for , _ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations provided some temporal and spectral information ( yancopoulos , hamilton & helfand 1994 ; wang & halpern 1997 ) .",
    "its x - ray light curve shows one broad pulse per period , with a pulsed fraction @xmath33 .",
    "the detected x - ray spectrum can be described by a pl model with a photon index @xmath34 .",
    "on the other hand , the same spectrum can be interpreted as thermal emission with a blackbody ( bb ) temperature @xmath35 mk and emitting area of a @xmath36 m radius .",
    "the properties of the x - ray emission of are even less certain . although the pulsar was detected with",
    "_ rosat _ ( manning & willmore 1994 ) , the small number of source counts collected ( @xmath37 ) precluded a meaningful data analysis .",

    "further observations with narrower filters have shown that their optical radiation is likely of a nonthermal origin ( mignani et al .",
    "2002 ; zharikov et al .",
    "in particular , the bvri spectrum of  was found to be consistent with a pl model with a broad range of photon indices , @xmath392.05 . because of poor quality of the x - ray data available , the connection of the optical and x - ray spectra remained unclear .",

    "we present the analysis and interpretation of a recent   observation of , the oldest ordinary pulsar detected outside the radio wavelengths .",
    "we describe the  data in  2 and present the results of our timing and spectral analysis in  3 .",
    "interpretations of the broad - band spectrum are discussed in  4 . in ",
    "5 we compare the observed properties of   with the pulsar models and observations of other pulsars , including six old pulsars observed in x - rays . we summarize our results in  6 .",
    "observed  on 2002 may 89 ( orbit 442 ) for 83.9 ks and 58.0 ks effective exposures with the epic - mos and epic - pn instruments , respectively .",
    "for about 28 ks epic - mos1 was operated in full frame mode providing an image of a large area , @xmath40 , with time resolution of 2.6 s. for the rest of the time it was in timing mode , which provides high time resolution of 1.5 ms at the expense of one dimension of the image . epic - mos2 was in full frame mode for the whole exposure .",
    "epic - pn was used in small window mode which covers a @xmath41 region and provides a @xmath42 ms time resolution .",
    "all the epic instruments were used with medium filters .",
    "two reflection grating spectrometers ( rgss ) observed the target in the standard spectroscopy mode for 84.4 ks .    due to the high sensitivity and relatively high time resolution , the data collected with epic - pn are most suitable for studying the x - ray emission from .",
    "we used the epic - pn data processed with the most recent version of the sas package ( v.6.0.0 ) .",
    "time intervals with strong background flares at the beginning and the end of the observation were excluded , which , with account for the 70% efficiency of small window mode , resulted in a 51.1 ks effective exposure . the pulsar is clearly detected in the epic - pn image at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which differs from the radio position ( table 1 ) by @xmath45 , well within the @xmath46@xmath47 uncertainty of the epic absolute astrometry .",
    "the shape of the epic - pn image of the pulsar is consistent with that expected for a point - like source .",
    "we put a 3@xmath48 upper limit of @xmath49 photons s@xmath3 @xmath50 arcmin@xmath51 , on the surface brightness of emission from a possible pulsar - wind nebula at distances @xmath52@xmath53 from the pulsar .",
    "we extracted the source ( plus background ) photons from a @xmath54-radius circle centered at the pulsar position , which encircles about 82% of all detected source counts .",
    "for the analysis , we selected only single and double events ( with photon - induced charge detected in a single ccd pixel and two adjacent pixels with horizontal or vertical splits ) for which the instrumental response is known ( those events provide about 98% of all detected photons ) .",
    "the extracted count rate spectrum shows strong excesses of single and double events at energies below 0.2 and 0.4 kev , respectively ( cf .  van kerkwijk et al .",
    "2004 ) , probably caused by the internal epic - pn ` flickering ' . because the distribution of these detector background events is rather nonuniform over the field of view , they can not be reliably subtracted ; therefore we had to discard single events with @xmath55 kev and double events with @xmath56 kev .",
    "the background was estimated from several circles of the same @xmath54-radius centered at different positions .",
    "after the correction for the 82% encircled count fraction , we found the source count rate of @xmath57 counts s@xmath3 for single events in the 0.210 kev range . adding doubles with @xmath58 kev increases this value by 26% .",
    "because of the much lower sensitivity , the epic - mos instruments detected the pulsar at a very low rate of about 0.007 counts s@xmath3 , which makes the epic - mos1 data taken in timing mode hardly useful for the analysis because of a strong background contamination ( the same concerns the rgs data where the source count rate is even smaller ) .",
    "we also do not use the epic - mos data taken in the imaging mode because of uncalibrated changes in the low - energy spectral response of the epic - mos detectors .",
    "for the pulsation search , we used 1,568 events ( singles and doubles ) within the @xmath59 circle , in the 0.25.0 kev range , where the pulsar radiation prevails over the background .",
    "the source was estimated to contribute about 84% of the selected events .",
    "the photon times of arrival were transformed to the solar system barycenter with the `` barycen '' task of the sas package . using the tempo code , we calculated the radio ephemeris ( see table 1 ) based on observations of  in 2002 at the torun radio astronomy observatory ( the data provided by wojciech lewandowski ) . for the radio - pulsar frequency at the epoch of the  observation , the @xmath60 test ( e.g. , buccheri et al .  1983 ) yields values @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ,",
    "of which the latter is most significant : the probability to obtain this value by chance in one trial is @xmath64 .    using the radio data and the tempo code , we extracted the x - ray pulse profiles in radio phases ( @xmath65 corresponds to the phase of radio pulse maximum ) from the single - event data in four energy ranges , 0.20.5 , 0.51 , 15 and 0.25 kev ( see fig .  1 ) . at energies @xmath66 kev ( which contribute the bulk of the total detected emission )",
    "the light curves show two distinct peaks , centered at phases @xmath67 and 0.85 .",
    "the shapes of these peaks and the large pulsed fraction suggest a predominantly nonthermal origin of the pulsar emission at @xmath66 kev .",
    "interestingly , the separation @xmath68 between the peaks is about the same as @xmath69 between the radio pulse and interpulse , albeit the radio interpulse is a factor of 50 weaker than the main pulse ( everett & weisberg 2001 ) .",
    "the shape of the light curve at lower energies looks different .",
    "the highest peak in the light curves at @xmath66 kev ( at @xmath67 ) is strongly suppressed in the 0.20.5 kev pulse profile , so that the peak at @xmath70 becomes dominant in this energy band .",
    "additionally , the pulsed fraction in the 0.20.5 kev band is reduced to about 33% ( albeit with large uncertainties ) . to check whether the change in the shapes of the pulse profiles shown in the upper three panels of figure 1 is statistically significant",
    ", we applied the @xmath71 test as described by zavlin & pavlov ( 1998 ) .",
    "this test gives a probability of 97.1% that the shapes of the light curves extracted in the 0.20.5 kev and 15 kev bands are different .",
    "the same test shows that the shapes of the 0.20.5 kev and 0.51 kev light curves are different with a probability of 94.7% .",
    "therefore , it seems quite plausible that the change of the pulse shape and pulsed fraction is real . since one can hardly expect significant changes of pulsations in a single nonthermal component over such a narrow energy range , we consider the apparent energy dependence of pulsations as an indication of the presence of another emission mechanism(s ) , with the main contribution at @xmath72 kev .",
    "the epic - pn data on , reduced as described in  2 , were used for the spectral analysis . because of the small number of counts collected",
    ", phase - resolved spectroscopy can not produce useful results , so we have to use the phase - integrated spectrum .",
    "the epic - pn spectrum of the pulsar was binned in 32 spectral bins in the 0.210 kev range with at least 40 source counts per bin .",
    "this provides the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath736 in the spectral bins below 2 kev and @xmath744 at @xmath75 kev .",
    "we checked that varying the number of source counts per bin between 30 and 50 ( with @xmath76 in each of the spectral bins ) makes no significant effect on the results presented below .",
    "we also verified that the 0.410 kev spectrum composed of double events is well consistent with that obtained from single events .",
    "since the double - event spectrum is more noisy and contains only a quarter of the whole flux , we used only the single - event data for the further spectral analysis .",
    "we started from fitting the pulsar count rate spectrum with one - component thermal models ( blackbody [ bb ] and ns atmosphere ) and found the best - fit models to be much softer than the data at @xmath77 kev , which resulted in an unacceptably large minimum @xmath78 ( @xmath79 for @xmath80 degrees of freedom [ d.o.f . ] ) .",
    "a fit with two thermal components ( e.g. , bb+bb ) still has the same problem at @xmath81 kev .",
    "in addition , it yields an unreasonably high temperature , @xmath82 mk , and an unrealistically small size ( @xmath83 m radius ) for the harder component .",
    "this means that the observed spectrum at higher energies is of a nonthermal ( presumably magnetospheric ) origin , in agreement with the timing results (  3.1 ) .",
    "the ( absorbed ) pl model fits the data much better ( @xmath84 for 29 d.o.f .",
    " see fig .",
    "2 ) kev can be attributed to uncertainties in the calibration of the epic - pn detector . ] , yielding the photon index @xmath85 and the absorbing hydrogen column density @xmath86 ( @xmath87 errors are given here and below ) .",
    "the observed ( absorbed ) flux in the 0.210 kev range , @xmath88 erg s@xmath3 @xmath50 , corresponds to the ( unabsorbed ) isotropic luminosity pc ( brisken et al .",
    "@xmath89 erg s@xmath3 and the `` nonthermal x - ray efficiency '' @xmath90 .",
    "although the pl fit is ( marginally ) acceptable , and the derived fitting parameters look reasonable , the fit residuals show that the model is somewhat softer than the data at @xmath81 kev ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this can be considered as an additional argument supporting the suggestion in  3.1 that the x - ray emission of  consists of at least two components of different origin .",
    "it is natural to assume ( see  1 ) that , in addition to the magnetospheric emission , thermal emission from heated pcs contributes to the observed x - ray flux ( see  1 ) . as a first step in the two - component ,",
    "nonthermal plus thermal , fit , we added a standard bb model to the pl component .",
    "the fit gives the bb temperature @xmath91 mk , effective radius @xmath92 m , and bolometric luminosity @xmath93 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "( the superscript @xmath94 is used for the values as measured by a distant observer .",
    "the values as measured at the ns surface are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , where @xmath98^{-1}=[1 - 2gm / c^2r]^{1/2}$ ] . )",
    "the pl photon index of the nonthermal component is @xmath99 , while the nonthermal luminosity , @xmath100 erg s@xmath3 , corresponds to the nonthermal x - ray efficiency @xmath101 .",
    "the hydrogen column density derived from the bb+pl fit , @xmath102 , is almost the same as obtained from the pl fit above , and it does not contradict to independent estimates ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tools/w3nh/w3nh.pl ) .",
    "uv observations of stars at distances 110160 pc from the pulsar give @xmath103 in a range of 0.110 , with large uncertainties ( http://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/ismform ) . ] .",
    "the quality of the bb+pl fit , @xmath104 for @xmath105 , is somewhat better than that obtained with the single pl model , although , according to the standard _",
    "f_-test , the probability that the spectral data require the second component is not very high , 96.1% .",
    "the radius obtained from the bb+pl fit is much smaller than the expected pc radius , @xmath106 m. in addition , the isotropic bb emission from two symmetric pcs can not reproduce the strong pulsations for realistic @xmath107 ratio ( e.g. , zavlin , shibanov & pavlov 1995 ) .",
    "however , the spectrum and the beaming of thermal emission can be substantially different from those of bb emission if the ns surface is covered by a light - element ( hydrogen or helium ) atmosphere ( see zavlin & pavlov 2002 for a review on ns atmospheres ) .",
    "for example , if there is as few as @xmath108 g of hydrogen in the ns surface layers ( e.g. , as a result of accretion from the interstellar medium and/or fallback of a fraction of the envelope ejected during the supernova explosion ) , this hydrogen will rise to the surface forming an optically thick , purely hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "the spectrum emerging from a hydrogen atmosphere , which is almost fully ionized at the expected temperatures @xmath109 k and magnetic fields @xmath110@xmath111 g , is considerably harder at higher energies than the planck spectrum with the same effective temperature , so that fitting the observed spectrum with a bb model gives a higher temperature and a smaller size , compared to their actual values ( e.g. , pavlov et al .  1995 ) .",
    "in addition , strong magnetic fields in ns atmospheres affect the beaming and the spectrum of the emergent radiation ; in particular , the spectrum from a strongly ionized atmosphere shows an absorption line at the electron cyclotron energy @xmath112 kev .    to determine the effective temperature @xmath113 and the radius @xmath114 of pcs under the assumption of hydrogen atmosphere , we assume that the thermal x - rays are emitted from two similar , uniformly heated pcs around the magnetic poles of a centered magnetic dipole .",
    "in addition to the temperature and radius , the ( phase - integrated ) model spectrum depends on the magnetic field , inclination @xmath115 of the rotation axis to the line of sight , magnetic inclination @xmath116 between the magnetic and rotational axes , and the mass - to - radius ratio , @xmath107 , that is responsible for the redshift and bending of photon trajectories in the strong gravitational field of the ns . since a fit with",
    "so many fitting parameters would be essentially unconstrained , we have to choose fixed values for some of them .",
    "based on the results of the single pl and bb+pl fits , we restricted the absorption column density in a plausible range , @xmath117 , chose , as an example , @xmath118 g ( which is the magnetic field at the poles of an orthogonal rotator in the idealized magnetic dipole radiation model , @xmath119^{1/2}$ ] g ) , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 km ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) .",
    "we calculated the model specific intensities of emitted radiation on a @xmath113 grid and incorporated them in the xspec package .",
    "these intensities provide the spectra at different rotational phases as well as the phase - integrated spectrum ( see zavlin et al .",
    "1995 and zavlin & pavlov 1998 for more detail ) .",
    "the two - component ( pc+pl ) fit ( @xmath125 , for 27 d.o.f . ) resulted in the pc ( effective ) temperature @xmath126 mk and radius @xmath127 m ( as measured at the ns surface ) , the pl photon index @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "varying @xmath115 and @xmath116 between @xmath130 and @xmath131 and the mass - to - radius ratio in a plausible range of @xmath132@xmath133 changes the best - fit temperature by @xmath134 mk and the best - fit radius by @xmath135 m. the bolometric luminosity of the thermal component is @xmath136 erg s@xmath3 ( for two pcs ) , while the nonthermal component has the same luminosity as the best bb+pl fit .",
    "the best pc+pl fit , together with the two spectral components , is shown in figure 3 . as seen from this plot ,",
    "the thermal component dominates at @xmath137 kev , providing about 60% of the total flux observed in the 0.20.5 kev range .",
    "we checked that varying the magnetic field makes almost no effect on the inferred pc parameters as far as the cyclotron energy remains in the wien tail , @xmath138 g.      the pc model used in  3.2 for the analysis of the phase - integrated spectrum predicts a large variety in pulse profiles of the thermal emission , depending on the pulsar geometry , mass - to - radius ratio , and surface magnetic field ( zavlin et al .",
    "therefore , these parameters can be constrained from the comparison of the model light curves with the observed ones ( cf .",
    "pavlov & zavlin 1997 ) . to make such a comparison for",
    ", one first needs to single out the contribution of the possible thermal component in the observed light curve . assuming that the pulse shape of the nonthermal flux does not depend on photon energy in the observed x - ray range",
    ", we scaled the nonthermal light curve of the 15 kev band ( where the pc contribution is virtually negligible , @xmath139 ) to the 0.20.5 kev band , chosen for the thermal light curve analysis , and subtracted the scaled nonthermal light curve .",
    "the scaling factor of 0.31 was estimated as the ratio of the number of counts provided by the nonthermal component of the best pc+pl fit of  3.2 in the 0.20.5 kev band to the total number of counts in the 15 kev band ( varying the parameters of the pl component within the 1@xmath48 confidence range changes this factor by 15% only , which makes a negligible effect on the results presented below ) .",
    "the result of the light curve subtraction is shown in figure 4 .",
    "although the residual pulse profile is noisy because of the scanty statistics , it shows a structure around the phase @xmath140 which can be interpreted as a pulse of thermal emission .",
    "the pulsed fraction of this light curve is fairly large , with a lower limit of 35% .",
    "such a high pulsed fraction can not be obtained with the isotropic bb radiation for any @xmath115 and @xmath116 unless the ns mass - to - radius ratio is so ( unrealistically ) small , @xmath141 ( i.e. , gravitational redshift @xmath142 ) , that the effect of the gravitational bending is negligible .",
    "therefore , a strong magnetic field , @xmath143 g , is required to explain the large pulsed fraction .",
    "in strong fields , such that @xmath144 , the angular distribution of the emergent radiation shows a narrow beam along the direction of the magnetic field ( where the atmospheric plasma is most transparent for radiation ) and a rather broad hollow - cone beam around the magnetic field direction ( pavlov et al .  1994",
    "; zavlin & pavlov 2002 ) . if @xmath115 and @xmath116 are such that the narrow beam passes through the line of sight in the course of pulsar rotation , the observed flux can be very strongly modulated .",
    "because of the large errors in the residual light curve shown in figure 4 , fitting it with the multi - parameter pc models is hardly warranted .",
    "instead , we crudely determined domains of parameters where this light curve qualitatively agrees with the models . for several sets of @xmath145 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath107",
    ", we found best - fit @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath146 from spectral fits ( as described in  3.2 ) , used these values to compute the model fluxes as a function of phase , and folded these fluxes with the epic - pn response . comparing the model light curves with the residual light curve , we found that a reasonably good agreement can be achieved , for example , in the following ranges of parameters : @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149@xmath150 g , and @xmath1511.6 . at larger @xmath152 ,",
    "the peak direction of the narrow beam ( along the magnetic axis ) remains too far from the line of sight , which results in low modulation of the model flux .",
    "the modulation is also too low at small @xmath115 and/or @xmath116 , while at @xmath115 and @xmath116 close to @xmath131 we would see two peaks of comparable strength , in contradiction with the residual light curve . at higher magnetic fields ,",
    "the central beam becomes too narrow , so that the pulse profiles with a sufficiently large pulsed fraction are sharper than observed .",
    "an example of a reasonably good agreement is shown in the upper panel of figure 4 that presents a model light curve with @xmath153 g , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156/[r/10\\,{\\rm km}]=1.4 $ ] ( @xmath157 mk , @xmath158 m , and @xmath159 ) .",
    "the model pulsed fraction is @xmath160 .    in principle ,",
    "independent estimates on the angles @xmath115 and @xmath116 can be obtained from the phase dependence of the position angle of the linearly polarized radio emission ( radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ) . for , the estimates obtained by different authors are summarized by everett & weisberg ( 2001 ) .",
    "most of them suggest that  is an almost aligned rotator with only one pole visible : @xmath161 , @xmath162 . at such small angles , the pulsed fraction of the pc x - ray radiation , @xmath163 , is too low to be consistent with the residual light curve , even with account for the uncertainty in the light curve subtraction .",
    "the result of everett & weisberg ( 2001 ) , @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( an almost orthogonal rotator , with two poles visible ) , differs significantly from the others . the pulse profile for the pc model with these angles and @xmath153 g , @xmath121 and @xmath122 km ( @xmath166 mk and @xmath167 m , @xmath159 ) is shown in the lower panel of figure 4 .",
    "its pulsed fraction is @xmath168 .",
    "although the agreement does not look as good as in the upper panel , the deviation from the observational light curve is well within the uncertainties .",

    "5 ) can be crudely described by a pl spectral model , with a photon index @xmath169 ( zharikov et al .",
    "2004 ) was obtained neglecting the interstellar extinction .",
    "the large scatter of fluxes in the different optical bands and the resulting uncertainty of spectral slope are likely due to errors in subtraction of the flux of background objects near . ] .",
    "this means that both optical ( @xmath1705 ev ) and x - ray ( @xmath171 kev ) emission from  are nonthermal , most likely emitted by relativistic particles in the pulsar magnetosphere . from observations of younger pulsars , we know that the optical and x - ray parts of the nonthermal spectrum can be described by the same pl model for some of them ( e.  g. , psr b0656 + 14",
    "; see pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ) , while in others the optical spectrum is harder than the x - ray spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath172 ) , and it lies below the extrapolation of the x - ray power law as , for example , in the crab pulsar ( kuiper et al .",
    "the change of the spectral slope in the latter case can be attributed to , e.g. , deviation of the spectrum of emitting electrons from the pure pl or , less likely , to different populations of electrons emitting in the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "the two possible interpretations of the x - ray spectrum of   ( pure pl and pc+pl ) correspond to the different broad - band ( optical through x - rays ) spectra described above .",
    "the extrapolation of the single pl model with @xmath1731.9 towards lower energies exceeds the observed optical spectrum by a factor of 1030 , depending on @xmath174 and optical frequency . in this case",
    ", we have to assume a change in the pl slope somewhere in the euv or soft - x - ray range and a rather small @xmath175 , as demonstrated in the upper panel of figure 5 . on the contrary , the extrapolation of the pl component of the pc+pl model , which we consider more plausible than the single pl model , goes through the optical points , so that the nonthermal spectrum in the 1 ev  10 kev range can be described by a single pl with @xmath101.4 .",
    "the lower panel of figure 5 shows the broad - band spectrum for @xmath176 ; the corresponding broad - band nonthermal luminosity is @xmath177 erg s@xmath3 = @xmath178 , of which the optical luminosity is a small fraction ( e.g. , @xmath179 erg s@xmath3 = @xmath180 ) .",
    "because of the small emitting area , the thermal pc radiation falls about 3 orders of magnitude below the detected optical fluxes . on the other hand",

    "( 2004 ) detected thermal emission from the much older ( @xmath184 gyr ) millisecond pulsar j04374715 , corresponding to the surface temperature of about 0.1 mk .",
    "therefore , one could expect at least a similar surface temperature for the younger , unless millisecond pulsars are heated by a specific mechanism that does not work in `` ordinary '' pulsars ( e.g. , reisenegger 1997 ) .",
    "to illustrate the effect of such temperatures on the broad - band spectrum of , we assumed a bulk surface temperature @xmath185 mk and plotted the corresponding ( bb ) spectrum in the lower panel of figure 5 , for a ns radius @xmath186 km .",
    "this thermal component ( ts ) gives virtually no contribution into the observed x - ray range , but it would be observable in the far - uv range , at @xmath187  .",
    "since the bulk of the x - ray and optical emission observed from is nonthermal , it is interesting to compare it with the nonthermal emission from other spin - powered pulsars .",
    "we know from x - ray observations that the pulsar nonthermal luminosity shows a correlation with the spin - down power @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , possenti et al .  (",
    "2002 ) found a fit @xmath188 erg s@xmath3 , based on observations of 37 pulsars ( mostly with _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , and _ beppo - sax _ ) .",
    "however , the observed luminosities showed large deviations , up to 2 orders of magnitude , from this dependence .",
    "the scatter becomes even larger if one includes the upper limits for pulsars that were not detected in deep observations ( see some examples in  5.3 ) .",
    "such a scatter can be naturally explained by geometrical factors .",
    "firstly , the actual luminosity can be substantially different from the `` isotropic luminosity '' @xmath189 because pulsar s x - ray radiation is anisotropic , as we see from their pulsations , and even powerful and radio - bright pulsars can be quite faint in x - rays if the rotating x - ray beam misses the earth .",
    "secondly , the properties of the pulsar s magnetosphere and its radiation can strongly depend on the magnetic inclination @xmath116 that is unknown for most pulsars .",
    "therefore , more physical is the `` line of maximum luminosity '' in the @xmath26-@xmath190 plane , such that all the observed luminosities lie below that line .",
    "the ratio @xmath191 characterizes maximum efficiency of conversion of the spin - down power into x - ray radiation .",
    "possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested @xmath192 , in the 210 kev band , which implies that pulsars with low @xmath26 are less efficient x - ray emitters .",
    "the derived luminosity of the nonthermal component of  in the 210 kev range is @xmath193 erg s@xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath194 .",
    "these values exceed by a factor of 20 the prediction of the @xmath195@xmath26 correlation derived by possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , being close to the maximum values , @xmath196 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath197 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the nonthermal x - ray luminosity of is only a factor of 2 lower than that of the much more powerful ( @xmath198 erg s@xmath3 ) middle - aged ( @xmath199 kyr ) pulsar b0656 + 14 ( pavlov et al .  2002 ) , which means that b0656 + 14 is a factor of 3040 less efficient nonthermal x - ray emitter than b0950 + 08 . even less efficient , by a factor of about 600 with respect to b0950 + 08 , is the younger ( @xmath200 kyr ) vela pulsar ( pavlov et al .",
    "based on these examples , it might be tempting to speculate that the nonthermal x - ray efficiency grows with decreasing @xmath26 or increasing @xmath201",
    ". however , there are many other middle - aged pulsars whose efficiency is much higher than that of b0656 + 14 or vela , even with account for larger uncertainties in their distances .",
    "therefore , the most plausible reason for the high nonthermal x - ray efficiency of b0950 + 08 is not its low spin - down power or old age , but the above - mentioned geometrical effects .",
    "the optical part of the nonthermal spectrum of  also shows an optical efficiency , @xmath202 , much higher than those of the optically detected middle - aged pulsars ( geminga , b0656 + 14 , and vela ) , but comparable to those of most powerful , very young pulsars ( b054069 and crab ) .",
    "zharikov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that this shows `` non - monotonic evolution '' of the optical efficiency and speculate about its physical explanations .",

    "this means that a more plausible explanation is the same geometrical effect that is responsible for the apparent growth of the x - ray efficiency with age ( at @xmath207 kyr ) , derived from the very limited sample .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the fact that some old , low-@xmath26 pulsars show quite low x - ray efficiencies , contrary to b0950 + 08 and b1929 + 10 ( see  5.3 ) .",
    "the approximately constant value of @xmath203 suggests a common origin of the magnetospheric x - ray and optical emission and implies similar x - ray and optical beamings .",
    "finally , we can use the x - ray data to speculate about @xmath208-ray emission of .",
    "first , we can estimate the maximum photon energy @xmath209 up to which the spectral slope can remain the same as in the optical through x - ray range , from the condition that the total photon luminosity @xmath210 does not exceed @xmath26 .",
    "for example , it gives @xmath211 mev for the pl model with @xmath212 discussed in ",

    "1 gev range , a factor of 7 higher than the maximum possible contribution from the pl model of @xmath212 into this energy range .",
    "if , in future observations , @xmath208-ray emission is detected at @xmath214 mev or the detected @xmath208-ray flux exceeds the extrapolation of the x - ray pl spectrum at @xmath215 mev , it will mean that these @xmath208-rays are generated by a mechanism different from that responsible for the x - ray and optical emission .",
    "comparison of parameters of heated pcs with the predictions of pulsar models allows one to test these models and better understand the complex physical processes operating in spin - powered pulsars . the pc temperature and radius inferred from the data analysis",
    "strongly depend on the assumed model for thermal emission , while the bolometric luminosity is less sensitive to this assumption .",
    "for , the harder ns atmospheric emission yields a factor of 2 lower surface temperature and a factor of 25 larger emitting area than those obtained with the bb model , whereas the bolometric luminosities are approximately the same , @xmath216 erg s@xmath3 , corresponding to the `` pc efficiency '' @xmath217 ( per one polar cap ) . as we have shown in  3.2 , the assumption than the ns surface is covered with hydrogen leads to a pc radius , @xmath218340 m ( depending on the pulsar geometry and mass - to - radius ratio ) , that is in excellent agreement with the conventional estimate , @xmath219 m ( for @xmath122 km ) .",
    "different pulsar models predict quite different pc luminosities and efficiencies .",
    "a detailed analysis of pc heating , relevant to old pulsars , has been recently presented by harding & muslimov ( 2001 , 2002 ; hm01 and hm02 hereafter ) .",
    "they updated the space charge limited flow model ( arons 1981 ) by including the effects of general relativity on the electric field induced above the ns surface and taking into account inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of thermal x - rays from the ns surface by primary particles ( electrons ) accelerated in the ns magnetosphere . in these models ,",
    "the number of positrons accelerated downward to heat the pc is a tiny fraction of the number of primary electrons that are accelerated upward .",
    "the electron - positron pairs are created in the vicinity of ns surface in cascade processes initiated by @xmath208-ray photons emitted by the primary electrons . hm01 and hm02 calculated the luminosity of a pc heated by positrons produced through curvature radiation ( cr ) and radiation from ics .",
    "the former process dominates in pulsars with higher magnetic fields and shorter periods .",
    "pulsars with lower fields and longer periods are not capable of producing pairs through cr so that the positrons are produced through less efficient ics , which results in a lower pc luminosity .",
    "the period and magnetic field of are very close to the boundary between these two regimes ( the death line for cr pair production ; see fig .  1 of hm02 ) , so both heating mechanisms should be considered . the pc efficiency and",
    "the luminosity of a single pc heated by particles created through cr can be estimated from figure 7 of hm01 or figure 9 of hm02 : @xmath220 and @xmath221 erg s@xmath3 , exceeding by a factor of @xmath22240 the values we obtained from the spectral analysis .",
    "on the other hand , heating through ics ( at @xmath223 mk ) gives @xmath224 and @xmath225 erg s@xmath3 ( see figs .",
    "8 and 9 of hm02 ) , a factor of @xmath22224 lower than the observational result .",
    "this means that either pc heating by ics - produced positrons is more efficient than calculated by hm02 or , more likely , heating by cr - produced positrons is less efficient in the transition regime near the death line for cr pair production .",
    "the cr efficiencies were calculated by hm01 assuming a magnetic inclination angle @xmath226 ; they are expected to decrease with increasing @xmath116 , approaching @xmath227 at @xmath228 ( eq .  [ 68 ] of hm01 , after correcting the numerical coefficients : @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 in the conditions for applicability ; a.  harding 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "this limiting value is a factor of 10 lower than the @xmath232 estimated from the observation , so it seems plausible that the pcs of   are heated by cr - produced pairs if @xmath116 is close to @xmath131 .",
    "other models of pc heating have been briefly discussed by hm01 . as a rule , they predict pc luminosities much higher than observed ( see , e.g. , zavlin & pavlov 1998 ) , and their applicability to old , low-@xmath26 pulsars is unclear",
