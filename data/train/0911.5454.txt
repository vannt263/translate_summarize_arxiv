    "low dimensional sp@xmath0-bonded carbon materials have attracted tremendous attention because of their unique electronic properties and potential applications in nano - scale devices@xcite . for examples , depending on their diameters and chiralities , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) can be either metallic or semiconducting , and the later ones ( _ e.g. _ , semiconducting zigzag cnts ) are suitable for making nano - scale electronic devices@xcite .",
    "graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , which could be regarded as unrolled cnts , also exhibit unique electronic structures strongly dependent on the orientation of their edges and width@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , superlattices as well as various quantum structures based on cnts or gnrs have been the subject of active research in the past decades , and one - dimensional quantum wells and zero - dimensional quantum dots have been shown to form by either cnt - based@xcite or gnr - based@xcite structures .",
    "so far , most studies of cnts and gnrs have been conducted independently .",
    "the experimental realization of gnrs generally relies on standard e - beam ( or microscope ) lithography@xcite , chemical method@xcite , or synthetic method@xcite .",
    "quite recently , however , several promising methods were developed by using cnts to fabricate gnrs or cnt - gnr junctions via longitudinal cutting@xcite such as chemical attack or plasma etching to unzip cnts@xcite . besides , the side wall of cnts can be opened longitudinally by intercalation of lithium atoms or transition metal clusters and then ammonia followed by exfoliation@xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the degree of stepwise opening in cnts can be controlled by the experimental conditions , such as the amount of oxidizing agents , lithium atoms , or transition metal clusters , and partially open ( unzipped ) cnts ( or cnt - gnr junctions ) have been observed in transmission electron microscopy images@xcite .",
    "these experimental progresses imply that cnts and gnrs can be combined together with perfect - atomic - interfaces and new superlattices with cnt - gnr junctions can be realized@xcite . in such nanostructures ,",
    "the openings of cnts ( i.e. , curved gnr parts ) would offer various edges which are suitable for doping , adsorption , and chemical functionalization .",
    "in particular , zigzag edges have been found to exhibit localized edge states and unique magnetic ordering in gnrs and graphene nanostructures@xcite .",
    "being composed of both a cnt and a curved gnr ( with plenty edge structures ) , a partially open cnt is therefore expected to have more diverse electronic and magnetic properties than a pristine cnt or gnr , and these properties may be sensitively dependent on the opening degree .",
    "previous theoretical works only focused on partially open ( unzipped ) _ armchair _ cnts and demonstrated that they are by themselves magnetoresistive@xcite and spin - filter devices@xcite .",
    "in contrast , as far as we know , the physical properties of partially open _ zigzag _ cnts have been poorly investigated until now . in this work",
    ", electronic and magnetic properties of superlattices made of partially open zigzag cnts are investigated using spin - polarized density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "depending on the opening degree , the superlattices are found to show semiconducting or spin - polarized semiconducting / metallic behaviors .",
    "besides , some localized states appear around the fermi level and some of them could serve as quantum well states which can not be achieved in partially open armchair cnts . especially , magnetic ( spin ) ordering can be realized in these superlattice structures and mainly depends on the opening width rather than length unlike partially open armchair cnts .",
    "our calculations further suggest some special partially open zigzag cnts superlattices can also act as giant magnetoresistive devices under magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , the band gap as well as the localized states could be modulated by external transverse electric fields , and the conductance of two spin states may be tuned by a bias voltage along the tube axis .",
    "we carried out electronic structure calculations using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) potentials@xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the perdew - burk - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional@xcite implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite . the energy cutoff for a plane wave basis set is 400 ev . our models are optimized until energies are converged to 10@xmath1 ev and atomic forces are smaller than 0.02 ev /  . the supercell is sufficient large to ensure that the vacuum space between the adjacent cnts are at least 10    to avoid the interaction .",
    "three monkhost - pack _",
    "k_-point meshes are employed , yielding an @xmath2 1 mev per atom convergence of the total energy .",
    "the optimized geometrical structures are used to calculate the electronic and magnetic structures under uniform external electric field ( @xmath3 ) , implemented using a dipole layer in the vacuum as in the work of neugebauer and scheffler@xcite .    ,",

    "yellow and green balls represent carbon atoms on the perfect cnt and the open cnt parts , respectively .",
    "the openings are terminated with hydrogen atoms , represented by small white balls .",
    "the rectangle marks one supercell of partially open cnts .",
    "this figure shows the structure of nt(15 , 0 , 6)-ont(4 , 6 ) representing a partially open ( 15 , 0 ) cnt which has 6 ( 6 ) c - c dimer lines in the perfect cnt part ( open part ) along the tube axis , and the missing rows in the opening is 4.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    before the discussion of our models and results , we first introduce the definition of partially open cnt superlattices following the convention of previous work@xcite . as shown in figure 1 ,",
    "a partially open cnt consists of two parts : a perfect cnt part ( yellow color ) and an opening ( green color ) .",
    "we represent the system as nt(@xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath6)-ont(@xmath7 , @xmath8 ) where @xmath5 and @xmath4 correspond to the chiral vector of the cnt , @xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) is the length in the tube axis direction of the perfect ( open ) cnt in the units of columns of carbon atoms .",
    "@xmath7 is the missing width in units of carbon rows for the opening .",
    "for example , we denote the structure ( in figure 1 ) as nt(15 , 0 , 6)-ont(4 , 6 ) .",
    "such a supercell is repeated periodically in the tube axis direction to form a superlattice .",
    "a zigzag cnt could be either semiconducting or almost metallic at room temperature@xcite .",
    "thus , it is expected that partially open cnts obtained from distinct zigzag cnts may show different features depending on their chiralities . the ( 13 , 0 ) cnt ( with a band gap of @xmath2 0.72 ev in our caculations ) and the ( 15 , 0 ) cnt ( with a band gap of @xmath2 0.04 ev ) are considered to construct superlattices .",
    "we find that the electronic properties , especially the magnetic properties , of both kinds of partially open zigzag cnt superlattices depend more sensitively on the cutting width than the cutting length ; this is evidently different from the partially open armchair cnts@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for both ( 13 , 0 ) and ( 15 , 0 ) cnts , the spin - polarization takes place at the discontinuous zigzag edges of the opening when the cutting width @xmath9 5 .",
    "two different cutting widths ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are chosen to represent nonmagnetic ( nm ) and spin - polarized system , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we keep the total length of the superlattices as 2.56 nm ( @xmath6 + @xmath8 = 12 ) , and then change the cutting length @xmath8 . the results are listed in table i.    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     magnetic field @xmath12 can be applied to change the magnetic ( spin ) ordering of zgnrs and partially unzipped armchair cnts from the afm configuration to fm configuration@xcite .",
    "it has been estimated that the switching @xmath12 can be as low as 0.03 t at the liquid helium temperature ( 4k ) for zgnrs@xcite .",
    "similarly , it is expected that a magnetic field can also be used to turn the spin ordering of partially open zigzag cnt superlattices from afm ( ground state ) configuration to fm configuration .",
    "based on the unique electronic properties of partially open ( 15 , 0 ) cnt superlattices , we propose a magnetoresistance ( mr ) device [ a finite partially open ( 15 , 0 ) cnt superlattice connected to two semi - infinite intact metallic ( 15 , 0 ) cnts ] , with a very large value of mr .",
    "the afm ground state of partially open ( 15 , 0 ) cnt superlattices ( with @xmath7 = 6 ) is semiconducting with a band gap of @xmath2 0.20 ev ( figure 4a ) , so the conductance of the afm state around the fermi level is zero ( for an infinite superlattice ) or near zero ( for finite superlattice due to the coupling of the superlattice to electrodes ) .",
    "a sufficiently strong magnetic field @xmath12 will make the superlattice ferromagnetic and hence metallic ( figure 4a ) , which leads to new bands ( transport channels ) at low energies and a finite conductance near the fermi level .",
    "therefore , magnetic field @xmath12 can produce a dramatic change in the conductance of the system , which is quantified by the mr , defined as the relative change of the resistance when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "based on a conventional definition of mr ( mr@xmath13 ) , we expect a mr @xmath2 100% can be reached in @xmath2 0.20 ev energy range near the fermi level at low magnetic field @xmath12 around the liquid helium temperature .    .",

    "the inset of ( a ) and ( b ) are the corresponding geometric structures .",
    "the fermi level is set to zero.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the response of cnts to an external transverse electric field ( @xmath3 ) is also of interest for its future applications@xcite .",
    "our previous works show that the partially open armchair cnt behaves as an electric switching or a spin - filter under an @xmath3@xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to investigate the properties of partially open zigzag cnts under @xmath3 .",
    "as an example , we have considered nt(15 , 0 , 6)-ont(4 , 6 ) and nt(15 , 0 , 6)-ont(6 , 6 ) superlattices . for convenience , all the openings in the superlattices are put in the @xmath15 direction , shown as the insets of figures 5a and 5b .",
    "the @xmath3 has been applied in three directions ( @xmath17 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) perpendicular to the tube axis ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "figure 5 briefly shows the results of the two different superlattices under @xmath3 .    for nt(15 , 0 , 6)-ont(4 , 6 )",
    "superlattice , if @xmath3 is in the @xmath17 direction , the band gap changes little ( @xmath19 ev ) even under 0.5 v /    ( figure 5a ) .",
    "but the situation is opposite if the @xmath14 is in the @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) direction : the band gap decreases by @xmath2 86 % ( or @xmath2 72 % ) .",
    "such changes in the band gap is the response of localized states to external electric fields . from the band structures of nt(15 , 0 , 6)-ont(4 , 6 ) under @xmath3 = 0.3 v /    in @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions ( figure 5b )",
    ", we can clearly see that the gap change arises from the upwards / downwards shift of the two flat bands ( associated with the localized states ) relative to the unperturbed bands ( figure 2e ) when @xmath3 is applied in the @xmath16/@xmath15 direction . since the two localized states are mainly composed of the _ p@xmath20 _ orbital of carbon atoms on the top part of perfect cnt , their distributions are not uniform in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "thus , @xmath3 in the @xmath21 direction can effectively change the electrostatic potential of the localized states , and hence their energies .",
    "in contrast , there is no obvious difference in the @xmath17 direction for these localized states ( figure 2f ) , so @xmath14 will not result in a net energy change of each localized state , and consequently the energy gap does not change dramatically .",
    "our finding indicates that the energy of localized _ p@xmath20 _",
    "orbital states could be strongly influenced by the direction of charge polarization ( dipole direction ) induced by @xmath14@xcite .",
    "similar changes of energy gaps are also observed in the spin - polarized nt(15 , 0 , 6)-ont(6 , 6 ) superlattice ( data shown in figures 5c and 5d ) and nt(13 , 0 , 6)-ont(6 , 6 ) superlattice ( data not shown here ) .",
    "the above discussion demonstrates that the application of @xmath3 is an effective way to control the band gap of the superlattices .",
    "especially , the energy of the localized states can be modulated by this way for various practice purposes .    besides the @xmath17 and @xmath22 directions , the electric field can also be applied along the tube axis ( @xmath18 direction ) .",
    "our previous works show that if the electric field is transversely applied across the zgnrs or partially open armchair cnts , the occupied and unoccupied edge ( localized ) states associated with one spin orientation close their gap , whereas those associated with the other spin orientation widen theirs@xcite .",
    "then , the system can be forced into a half - metallic state by an appropriate applied electric field , resulting in an insulating behavior for one spin and metallic behavior for the other , and hence the conductance of the system becomes spin - polarized . the same idea may be applied to the partially open ( 15 , 0 ) cnts in the afm ground state : with a bias voltage ( electric field ) along the tube axis ( across the zigzag edges of the opening ) , the conductance of the two different spin states will be changed in different ways , even half - metallicity may be realized at high bias voltage .",
    "in conclusion , our results obtained from ab initio calculations demonstrate that the superlattices based on partially open zigzag carbon nanotubes have interesting electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "the localized states can be formed around the top of perfect cnt parts in such superlattices and the energy gap can be modified by the size of the opening .",
    "the width of the opening determines whether the ground state of the system is spin - polarized or not .",
    "interestingly , for the spin - polarized case , the spin states with antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering can be confined in a certain part of these structures .",
    "we also find that some partially open zigzag cnt superlattices are by themselves giant magnetoresistive devices .",
    "moreover , the band gap as well as the energy of localized states of the superlattices could be tuned by external transverse electric fields , and bias voltages along the tube axis direction may be used to control the conductance of two different spin states .",
    "these properties may be useful for future device application in nanoelectronics .",
