    "the hard x - ray transient pulsar 1a 111861 was discovered with the rotation modulation collimator ( _ rmc _ ) experiment on _ ariel v _ in 1974 @xcite .",
    "pulsations were detected in this source with a period of 405.3 s @xcite and the optical counterpart of this source was identified as he 3640 = wra 793 @xcite which is a highly reddened be star .",
    "the star has a visual magnitude of v = 12.1 and is classified as a o9.5iv - ve @xcite with strong balmer emission lines indicating the presence of an extended envelope .",
    "the uv spectrum shows many absorption features ; especially the civ line indicating a stellar outflow .",
    "the p - cygni profile gives a wind velocity in the range of 1600 @xmath2 300 km s@xmath3 and the general spectral profile is similar to that of the optical counterparts of other transient systems @xcite .",
    "the extinction value of @xmath4 = 2.8 @xmath2 0.3 mag . suggested the distance to be 4 kpc . from the corbet diagram @xcite for high magnetic field accreting pulsars ,",
    "the orbital period is expected to be around 350 days .",
    "the known correlation between the orbital period of be star binaries and @xmath5 ew of the optical companion also indicates a similar large orbital period @xcite for 1a 111861 .",
    "however , recently , detection of a 24-day binary period was reported by @xcite using _",
    "rxte_/pca data .",
    "_ einstein _ and _ exosat _ observations of this source were carried out in 1979 and 1985 respectively . during these observations",
    "the source was in a quiescent state and the luminosity calculated from the _",
    "exosat_/me observations was 0.5 - 3.0 @xmath610@xmath7 ergs s@xmath3 at 3 - 7 kpc .",
    "this confirms that in the quiescent state , centrifugal inhibition of accretion was not complete .",
    "three outbursts have so far been detected in this source .",
    "first outburst was in 1974 @xcite .",
    "the source had a second outburst that was first detected with burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "( _ cgro _ ) in 1991/1992 . during this period",
    "the source had a peak flux of about 145 mcrab and a spin down rate of 0.016 s / day @xcite .",
    "the source was also observed by the watch all sky monitor on _ granat _ @xcite .",
    "1a 1118616 was in quiescence for @xmath820 years and became highly active in 2009 january .",
    "the main outburst lasted only for about @xmath820 days .",
    "this third outburst , observed by _ swift_/xrt in january 2009 revealed a pulsation period of 407.68 s @xcite indicating a spin - down in between the outbursts .",
    "about three weeks after the start of the outburst , the source was also observed with the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( _ integral_/jem - x / isgri ) which detected a flaring activity after the main outburst @xcite .",
    "many observations of this source were carried out with _ rossi x - ray timing explorer_/proportional counter array ( _ rxte_/pca ) during this period , and the combined analysis of the _ rxte_-pca and high energy x - ray timing explorer ( hexte ) spectra revealed a cyclotron line absorption feature at 55 kev which gives a magnetic field strength of 4.8 @xmath6 10@xmath9 g for the neutron star @xcite .",
    "most of the transient high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) pulsars are known to have a be star companion . in be / x - ray binaries , x - ray emission is thought to be due to the accretion of matter by the neutron star from the slow , dense , radial outflow of the be star @xcite .",
    "these systems are observed to exhibit two different types of x - ray outbursts .",
    "one is short x - ray outbursts ( type - i outbursts ) lasting for a few days ( @xmath10 ergs s@xmath3 ) occuring in several successive binary orbits at orbital phase close to the time of periastron passage and other is giant x - ray outbursts ( type - ii outbursts ) lasting for several weeks ( @xmath11 ergs s@xmath3 ) and may start at any orbital phase .",
    "the current outburst in 1a 1118 - 61 appears to be a type - ii outburst but of shorter duration and smaller peak luminosity than the type - ii outbursts in most other be / x - ray binary pulsars .",
    "we have carried out a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the _ rxte_-pca observation of this source during the 2009 january outburst , to detect any intensity or energy dependence of the pulse profile , aperiodic variabilities and also to find a suitable spectral model in the 3 - 30 kev band .",
    "one component of the aperiodic variabilities seen in x - ray binaries is the quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ) , generally thought to be related to the innermost regions of the accretion disk .",
    "any inhomogeneous matter distribution or blobs of material in the inner disk may result in qpos in the power spectrum .",
    "this can give useful information about the interaction between accretion disk and the central object at different intensity levels .",
    "hmxb pulsars show qpos only at low frequency , i.e. in the range of 10 mhz upto about 1 hz .",
    "black hole x - ray binaries and low magnetic field neutron stars show qpos over a wide range of frequency from a few hz to a few hundred hz . studying qpos and their variations with energy and luminosity",
    "gives important clues about the mechanism of qpo production . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and the data used in the present work . in section 3",
    "we present the pulsation analysis , the power density spectra , the pulse phase averaged and pulse phase resolved spectroscopy using the _ rxte_-pca archival data followed by a discussion of the results in section 4 .",
    "during the 2009 outburst of the pulsar 1a 111861 , a series of observations were carried out with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "the _ rxte _ consists of two non - imaging instruments : pca & the hexte and an all sky monitor ( asm ) that is sensitive to x - ray photons between 1.5 - 12 kev .",
    "the data analyzed in this paper are from observations carried out using the pca detectors .",
    "the pca consists of five xenon proportional counter units , sensitive in the energy range of 2 - 60 kev with a total effective area of 6500 @xmath12 .",
    "a total of 144 ks of useful pca data was obtained from 26 pointings carried out during the outburst . for most of the pointings only one or two proportional counter units ( pcus )",
    "the long term light curves of 1a 111861 are shown in figure  [ asm - pcu ] for different energy bands .",
    "the top panel shows the asm light curve in 2 - 15 kev energy band with one day bin size , the middle panel shows the pcu2 light curve with a bin size same as spin period and the bottom panel shows the 15 - 50 kev light curve from the _ swift_-bat all sky monitor with a one day bin size . for the timing analysis presented in the next section , we have used standard1 mode data of the pca having 0.125 s time resolution and good xenon mode data .",
    "we have used standard2 mode data for spectral analysis and the spectral fitting was performed using _ xspec _ v12.6.0 .",
    "we created 2 - 60 kev light curves of the source with a time resolution of 0.125 s from the standard1 mode data .",
    "to remove data acquired during periods of earth occultations and satellite unstable pointing , we have created good time intervals ( gti ) by screening the raw data with an offset of @xmath13 0.02 degrees and elevation angle @xmath14 10 degrees .",
    "subsequently , the background count rate was subtracted from the light curves .",
    "the 2009 outburst lasted for @xmath820 days starting around mjd 54834 and reached its maximum at around mjd 54845 .",
    "the source count rate reached a peak value of about 600 c / s per pcu . in all but the last few pca observations , the pulsations at around 408 s",
    "is clearly seen in the light curves . to measure the pulse period and its changes , we first carried out a barycenter correction and then applied the pulse folding and @xmath15 maximization technique .",
    "all the single data stretches were not long enough to measure the pulse period with high enough accuracy to investigate the pulse period evolution during this outburst .",
    "the most accurate pulse period measurement we obtained from any single observation is 407.58 s ( mjd 54845 ) .",
    "the pulse profile for each day were created by folding the light curve at the pulse period determined for that day and are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the pulse profile showed significant evolution in shape during the outburst . at the beginning of the outburst",
    ", the pulse profile is complex with a smaller peak before the main peak . as the outburst progressed , the amplitude of the second peak decreased and on some days the pulse profile appears to have a main peak , a narrow minimum offset by 0.5 spin phase with respect to the main peak and two steps in between the main peak and the minimum , like a shoulder . at the end of the outburst ,",
    "the overall shape of the pulse profile is a simple sinusoid , but with many narrow spikes or flares .",
    "to check for any energy dependence of the pulse profiles of 1a 111861 , we created light curves using good xenon mode data .",
    "we selected the observation ( obs id - p94032/94032 - 04 - 02 - 07 ) carried out on jan 14 near the peak of the outburst having the highest signal to noise ratio .",
    "the profiles generated for different energy ranges are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . at low energies , the pulse profile has two peaks with the main peak leading by a phase of about 0.4 , a dip after the smaller peak and a step before the main peak . at high energy ,",
    "the pulse is made of a single asymmetric peak aligned with the main peak in the low energy pulse profile .",
    "the energy dependence of the pulse profile is seen to be very complex in 1a 111861 .",
    "the smaller peak , seen quite clearly in low energy range , becomes weaker with increasing energy and above 10 kev , instead of a peak , the minimum of the pulse profile occurs at this phase .",
    "the phase range at which the minimum and the step occurs in the low energy band , grows in intensity with increasing energy and at high energy this becomes the leading part of the pulse peak .",
    "we investigated this complex energy dependence of the pulse profile by carrying out pulse phase resolved spectroscopy described later .",
    "we created power density spectrum ( pds ) from the 2 - 60 kev light curves of 1a 111861 using the ftool-_powspec_. the light curves were divided into stretches of length 4096 s and the pds obtained from each of these segments in one observation were averaged to produce the final pds .",
    "the expected white noise level was subtracted and the pds was normalized such that the integral gives the squared rms fractional variability .",
    "a peak at around @xmath16 hz corresponding to the spin frequency and its harmonics are seen clearly in all the pds except in the last few observations .",
    "in addition to the main peak , a qpo feature is also seen at 0.09 hz .",
    "the continuum of the power spectrum was fitted with a model consisting of a power law component and a lorentzian and the qpo feature was fitted by adding another lorentzian .",
    "the frequency bins corresponding to the pulse frequency and its harmonics were avoided while fitting the continuum .",
    "the qpo feature was detected during the period 54841 to 54854 mjd .",
    "a representative power spectrum with the qpo feature , is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the quality factor ( @xmath17 ) of the qpo feature was about 5.4 and the detection significance of the qpo feature , including data from all the days when the qpos were detected is 7@xmath18 .",
    "the rms fractional variability calculated from the background subtracted data was @xmath19 . using the event mode data , we have measured the energy dependence of the qpo rms which is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the rms value of the qpo is found to increase up to 9 kev and then decrease .",
    "qpos were detected on five different days and a plot of the qpo frequency and rms fractional variability on these days is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the qpo frequency decreased from 0.09 hz to 0.07 hz over a span of 10 days along with the decay of the outburst .",
    "to study the spectral variations during the outburst , we selected observations carried out on jan 07 , 14 , 20 , 21 , 24 and jan 30 covering the entire outburst .",
    "we used standard2 mode data collected with pcu2 detector only to extract the source spectrum .",
    "the background spectrum was simulated using the _ pcabackest _ tool and appropriate background models for bright sources provided by the xte guest observer facility ( gof ) was used .",
    "we have used 0.5@xmath1 systematic error to account for the calibration uncertainties while fitting the spectra .",
    "we first tried to fit the 3 - 30 kev spectrum with a model consisting of an absorbed power - law with a high energy cut off and a gaussian for the iron line emission .",
    "this did not give a satisfactory fit with reduced @xmath15 in the range of 1.6 - 9.3 .",
    "addition of a black body component improved the fit , with reduced @xmath15 in the range of 1.0 - 2.0 for all six spectra .",
    "temperature of the black body component was obtained as about 0.18 - 0.36 kev on different days , which is common for bright accretion powered pulsars ( paul et al .",
    "however , we found that with this model , the pulse phase resolved spectra could not be fitted for all phase bins .",
    "for some of the phase resolved spectra , it gives a rather high reduced @xmath15 of more than 8.0 .",
    "if the complex energy dependence of the pulse profile is produced by different pulse phase dependence of two different spectral components , the two should dominate at different energies ; one above and one below the energy at which the pulse shape changes , ie .",
    "@xmath810 kev for 1a 111861 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a blackbody component of temperature of a few hundred ev is therefore unlikely to produce the observed energy dependence of the pulse profile .",
    "on the other hand , we find that a model consisting of partial covering of a power - law with high energy cutoff and a gaussian line emission describes all the pulse phase averaged spectra and the pulse phase resolved spectra quite well . a partial covering model is known to fit a wide range of x - ray spectra of hmxb pulsars @xcite . in the present case",
    ", this model does not leave any soft excess and thus does not require a black body component .",
    "the reduced @xmath15 is also smaller compared to other models .",

    "<S> we report detailed timing and spectral analysis of _ rxte_-pca data obtained from observations during the outburst of a transient x - ray pulsar 1a 111861 in january 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse profile showed significant evolution during the outburst and also significant energy dependence @xmath0 a double peaked profile upto 10 kev and a single peak at higher energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have also detected quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) at 0.070.09 hz . </S>",
    "<S> the rms value of the qpo is 5.2 @xmath1 and it shows a significant energy dependence with highest rms of 7@xmath1 at 9 kev . the qpo frequency changed from 0.09 hz to 0.07 hz within 10 days . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field strength calculated using the qpo frequency and the x - ray luminosity is in agreement with the magnetic field strength measured from the energy of the cyclotron absorption feature detected in this source . </S>",
    "<S> the 3 - 30 kev energy spectrum over the 2009 outburst of 1a 111861 can be well fitted with a partial covering power - law model with a high energy cutoff and an iron fluorescence line emission . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse phase resolved spectral analysis shows that the partial covering and high energy cutoff model parameters have significant changes with the pulse phase .    </S>",
