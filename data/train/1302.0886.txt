    "the understanding of inner - shell dynamics under strong optical fields @xcite is essential to develop alternative femtosecond x - ray characterization methods @xcite and schemes to control the x - ray interaction with atoms and molecules @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the emergence of optical control schemes in the x - ray regime is of special interest to develop new approaches to tailor the x - ray pulse , reduce electronic damage in x - ray imaging experiments , and understand the optical - induced atom - specific dynamics .",
    "resonant auger processes have been extensively studied @xcite in the absence of optical fields . here",
    "we address resonant auger processes under strong optical fields , in which inner - shell dynamics is controlled by resonantly coupling two core - excited states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "if the optical field is intense enough , the inner - shell excited - state populations can be manipulated in a few femtoseconds during their decay .",
    "[ fig_1 ]    we focus on the resonant excitation @xmath2 in neon by x rays .",
    "previous works @xcite demonstrated dramatic modification of the @xmath2 absorption cross section in the presence of a @xmath3 w/@xmath4 optical field due to the optical coupling between core - excited states .",
    "however , in the present work we show that such coupling induces observable effects in the auger electron spectrum even with a @xmath5 w/@xmath4 optical field . in this work , we identify two essential features in the resonant auger electron spectrum in the presence of a strong optical field .",
    "first , the angular anisotropies are imprinted in the so - called ( angle - integrated ) sidebands , a multipeak structure in the auger electron spectrum induced by the optical - dressed continuum @xcite .",
    "second , the optical field , besides dressing the continuum , also resonantly couples two core - excited states and efficiently transfers population among them .",
    "hence the auger electron spectrum is the result of the resonant auger decay from both core - excited states .",
    "furthermore , such femtosecond - scale optical manipulation permits the study of resonant auger processes from core - excited states not accessible via one - photon transitions from the ground state .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theoretical_model ] we introduce our theoretical model to describe the resonant auger process under an intense optical field . in section [ sec : results ] we present the two main contributions of our work : the observation in the auger electron spectrum of the optical manipulation of the core - excited states and of the resonant angular anisotropies in the sidebands . the conclusion of our paper is drawn in section [ sec : conlusion ] .",
    "in our theoretical model for ne , see appendices for a detailed description , the x rays couple the ground state ( @xmath6 ) with the rydberg core - excited state @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) , while the optical field couples the rydberg core - excited states @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we apply a @xmath9-type three - level model , analogously to ref .",

    "[ fig_3](b ) we clearly observe that the optical field efficiently transfers some population to the @xmath1 state in the parallel configuration .",
    "previously , the x - ray absorption cross section near the @xmath2 excitation was studied @xcite in the presence of a @xmath62 w/@xmath4 optical field .",
    "it was shown that , in the perpendicular case , the optical field increases the linewidth of the absorption peak due to ionization , but does not mediate a coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 states because of selection rules . however , in the parallel case such coupling is mediated and , besides the increased linewidth , it also gives rise to a splitting that reduces the absorption cross section at the resonant frequency . here , with a much lower optical intensity",
    ", we can observe this effect in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](a ) , where the ground state depletion , related to the x - ray absorption cross section , is larger in the perpendicular configuration by a population difference @xmath63 .",
    "although this optical effect is small in the x - ray absorption cross section for the considered intensity , we can easily discern the resonant coupling between core - excited states by measuring the auger electron spectrum , as the intensity is enough to transfer population to the @xmath1 state .",
    "we can calculate the angle - integrated auger electron spectrum by performing the integral @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the population at the energy @xmath66 ( see fig . [",
    "fig_3](c ) ) .",
    "for the perpendicular configuration , the main @xmath56-peak is located at @xmath67 ev , but additional peaks separated by an optical photon energy also appear .",
    "this multipeak structure , namely sidebands , is due to the continuum - continuum transitions , and its energy range is proportional to the square root of the optical intensity and the kinetic energy of the electron @xcite . in our case",
    ", the energy range spans more than 20 ev for @xmath60 w/@xmath4 due to the high kinetic energy of the auger electron .",
    "however , for the parallel configuration where some population is transferred to the @xmath1 state , the auger electron spectrum is the combination of the auger decay from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states dressed by the optical field , and it thus includes the main @xmath51-peak at @xmath68 ev and its sidebands in fig .

    "[ fig_4 ]    we now consider the effects of the pronounced anisotropies in the multiplet terms @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 of @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "sidebands have been theoretically and experimentally studied for normal auger processes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the effects of the auger angular distribution anisotropies on the structure of the sidebands have not been addressed .",
    "sidebands strongly depend on the emission angle of the auger electron with respect to the optical polarization axis ( opa ) .",
    "we show here that the angular parameter @xmath70 is manifested in the angle - integrated auger electron spectrum , specifically in the envelope of sidebands .",
    "we emphasize that this effect is caused by the combination of the anisotropy of the auger electron emission and the intrinsic anisotropy of the sidebands @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](c ) the channels @xmath57 and @xmath58 had similar angular distributions and consequently similar sideband envelopes .",
    "now , considering the multiplet , we expect a stronger optical dressing on the auger electron from channel @xmath71 ( angular distribution almost parallel to the opa ) rather than from channel @xmath72 ( angular distribution almost perpendicular to the opa ) . figs .",
    "[ fig_4](a ) and [ fig_4](b ) show the angle - integrated auger electron spectrum within 800 - 823 ev and 812 - 820 ev respectively .",
    "[ fig_4](b ) we observe the clear difference between the envelopes of the @xmath73-sidebands and the @xmath74-sidebands .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath73-sidebands decreases by a factor of ten in an energy range of 10 ev , while the @xmath74-sidebands only decrease by a factor of two in the same range .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the anisotropies is also evident in comparing the relative heights of the three multiplet peaks , which are different at every optical photon energy .",
    "finally we remark that the auger electron spectrum detected perpendicular to the opa does not present sidebands ( see inset of fig . [ fig_4](b ) ) , where the same peaks of fig .",
    "[ fig_2](c ) ( besides a small energy shift corresponding to the ponderomotive potential @xmath75 ev , analogous to the ati phenomenon @xcite ) are visible with an additional peak approximately at @xmath76 ev from the @xmath1 decay .",
    "this feature is of special interest because measurements perpendicular to the opa can obtain the resonant auger spectrum from the @xmath1 state without being obscured by sidebands .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed resonant auger processes under a strong optical field .",
    "we focus on the @xmath2 excitation in ne , accounting for a resonant coupling between two rydberg core - excited states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , induced by the optical field . with no coupling between core - excited states ,",
    "the @xmath0 decays into a continuum dressed by the optical field , yielding the multipeak structure of sidebands .",
    "the angular anisotropy parameter , defining the angular distribution of the auger electron , is manifested in the envelope of the ( angle - integrated ) sidebands . with coupling between core - excited states",
    ", one can manipulate their population on the timescale of the natural lifetime if the intensity is large enough .",
