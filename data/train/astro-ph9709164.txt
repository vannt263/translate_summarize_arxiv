    "when performing optical polarimetry of astronomical objects , we wish to answer three distinct , but related , physical questions .",
    "firstly , is the object polarized at all ?",
    "secondly , if it is , what is the best estimate of the polarization ? and thirdly , what confidence can we give to this measure of polarization ?",
    "in addition to these physical questions is a presentational one : in what format should the results be published , so that they will be of most utility to the scientific community ?",
    "the questions of quantifying and presenting data on linear polarization have been discussed at length by simmons & stewart  , who note that the traditional method used by optical astronomers , that of serkowski  , does not give the best estimate of the true polarization under most circumstances .",
    "using their recommendations , i present here a recipe for reducing polarimetric data .",
    "in this paper , i will not consider the origin of the polarization of light .",
    "it may arise from intrinsic polarization of the source , from interaction with the interstellar medium , or within earth s atmosphere .",
    "each of these sources represents a genuine polarization , which must be taken into account in explaining the measured polarization values .",
    "most modern optical polarimetry systems employ a two - channel system , normally a wollaston prism .",
    "such a prism splits the incoming light into two parallel beams ( ` channels ' ) with orthogonal polarizations - it functions as a pair of co - located linear analyzers .",
    "the transmission axes of the analyzers can be changed either by placing a half - wave plate before the prism in the optical path , and rotating this , or by rotating the actual wollaston prism .",
    "such a system is incapable of distinguishing circularly polarized light from unpolarized light , and references to ` unpolarized ' light in the remainder of this paper strictly refer to light which is not linearly polarized ; it may be totally unpolarized ( i.e. randomly polarized ) , or may include a circularly polarized component .    where a half - wave plate is used , an anticlockwise rotation @xmath0 of the waveplate results in an anticlockwise rotation of @xmath1 of the transmission axes .",
    "( for the theory of wollaston prisms and wave plates , see , for instance , chapter 8 in hecht . )",
    "we will suppose that channel 1 of the detector has a transmission axis which can be rotated by some angle @xmath2 anticlockwise on the celestial sphere , relative to a reference position @xmath3 east of north .",
    "( see figure  [ figeta ] . )",

    "the reference angle @xmath3 will depend on the construction of the polarizer , and will not , in general , be neatly due north . for mathematical convenience in the rest of this paper , we will take @xmath3 to define a reference direction , ` r ' , in our instrumental co - ordinate system and relate all other angles to it .",
    "such instrumental angles can then be mapped on to the celestial sphere by the addition of @xmath3 .",
    "since the light emerging in the two beams has traversed identical paths until reaching the wollaston prism , this method of polarimetry does not suffer from the systematic errors due to sky fluctuation which affect single - channel polarimetry ( where a single beam polarimeter alternately samples the two orthogonal polarizations ) .",
    "the two channels will each feed some sort of photometric array , e.g. a ccd , which will record a photon count . since",
    "such images are usually built up by a process of shifting the image position on the array and combining the results , we will refer to a composite image taken in one transmission axis orientation , @xmath2 , as a _",
    "mosaic_. we will denote the rate of arrival of photons recorded in channel 1 and channel 2 by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . from these rates , we can calculate the total intensity ( @xmath11 ) of the source , and the difference ( @xmath12 ) between the two channels :    @xmath13    @xmath14    we can also define a _",

    "suppose we have a beam of light , which has a linearly polarized component of intensity @xmath17 , whose electric vector points at an angle @xmath18 anticlockwise of r. its unpolarized component is of intensity @xmath19 .",
    "when such a beam enters our detector , we can use malus law  @xcite to deduce that @xmath20 and @xmath21 from which we find @xmath22 and , less trivially , @xmath23 .",

    "this method has been used , for example , by di serego alighieri _ et al .",
    "( their refinement of the method allowed for the correction of the @xmath27 for instrumental polarization at each @xmath26 , which was necessary as they were rotating the entire camera , their system having no half - wave plate . )",
    "we note that if there is any systematic bias of channel 1 compared to channel 2 , this will show up as an @xmath2-independent ( dc ) term added to the sinusoidal component when @xmath27 is fitted to the data .",
    "such bias could arise if an object appears close to the edge of the ccd in one channel , for example .",
    "polarized light is normally quantified using stokes parameterisation .",
    "( for basic definitions see , for example , clarke , in gehrels ( ed . )  . )",
    "four variables are used , but one , @xmath29 , is only applicable to circular polarization , which a system involving only half - wave plates and linear analyzers can not measure .",
    "the total intensity , @xmath11 , of the light is an absolute stokes parameter .",
    "the other two parameters are defined relative to some reference axis , which in our case will be r , the @xmath3 direction .",
    "thus we define : @xmath30 and @xmath31    _ normalized _ stokes parameters are denoted by lower case letters ( @xmath32,@xmath33,@xmath34 ) , and are found by dividing the raw parameters by @xmath11 .",
    "we note that @xmath12 and the normalized @xmath35 can be thought of as a stokes parameter like @xmath36 or @xmath37 , generalised to an arbitrary angle - and results which can be derived for @xmath12 ( or @xmath35 ) will apply to @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( or @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) as special cases .",
    "if the stokes parameters are known , then the degree and angle of polarization can be found : @xmath38 @xmath39 where the signs of @xmath32 and @xmath33 must be inspected to determine the correct quadrant for the inverse tangent .",
    "note that @xmath40 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 _ must _ be defined as above to be consistent with the choice of r as reference .",
    "we must now distinguish between the true values of the stokes parameters for a source , and the values which we measure in the presence of noise .",
    "we will use the subscript @xmath41 to denote the underlying values , and the subscript @xmath42 for individual measured values .    in particular , consider a source which is not polarized , so @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is undefined .",
    "since the @xmath46 and @xmath47 include noise , they will not , in general , be zero , and because of the form of equation [ defp ] , @xmath48 will be a definite - positive quantity . in short , @xmath48 is a _ biased _",
    "estimator for @xmath49 .",
    "there is no known _ unbiased _",
    "estimator for @xmath49 , and simmons & stewart   discuss at length the question of which estimator should be used .",
    "they conclude that the stokes parameters themselves are more useful than @xmath16 and @xmath18 in many applications , and it is recommended , therefore , that all published polarimetric data should ideally give the normalized stokes parameters , with or without evaluation and discussion of @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "given this preference for the stokes parameters it appears that one should eschew the curve fitting method in favour of direct evaluation of the parameters , at least when we only have data for the usual angles @xmath50 .",
    "in practice , observers will take several observations of an object at each transmission angle .",
    "this raises the question of how best to combine all the measured values @xmath51 to yield a single pair of ` best estimators ' for @xmath52 and @xmath53  a question which is dealt with by clarke _",
    "et al . _",
    "on the basis of this prior work and set of recommendations , it is now possible to present a ` recipe ' for reducing polarimetric data .",
    "the raw numbers which our photometric system produces will be a set of photon count rates @xmath54 and @xmath55 , together with their errors , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "errors arise from three sources : photon shot noise ; pixel - to - pixel variations in the sky value superimposed on the target object ; and imperfect estimation of the modal sky value to subtract from the image @xcite .",
    "the photons arrive at the detector according to a poisson distribution .",
    "let the total integration time for a mosaic taken at a given rotation of the polarizer , be @xmath58 . if the detector requires @xmath59 photons to arrive in order for one ` count ' to be registered , then the total number of photons incident to produce the measured signal is @xmath60 .    under poisson statistics , using units of ` numbers of photons '",
    ", the standard deviation of the number of photons arriving in this time - bin is the square root of the mean number arriving , _ viz . _  @xmath61 . in our detector - based count rate units , therefore , the error contributed is @xmath62 .",
    "provided @xmath63 ,  @xcite then the shot noise will be normally distributed , to a good approximation .    the modal value of a sky pixel , @xmath64 can be found by considering , say , the pixel values in an annulus of dark sky around the object in question , an annulus which contains @xmath65 pixels altogether .",
    "the root - mean - square deviation of these pixels values about the mode can also be found , and we will label this , @xmath66 . hence we can estimate the error on the mode , @xmath67 .    if we perform aperture - limited photometry on our target , with an aperture of area @xmath68 in pixels , we must subtract the modal sky level , @xmath69 , which will introduce an error @xmath70 .",
    "each individual pixel in the aperture will be subject to a random sky fluctuation ; adding these in quadrature for each of the @xmath68 pixels , we obtain an error @xmath71 .",
    "ultimately , the error on the measured , normalized , intensity , is the sum in quadrature of the three quantities , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "if the areas of the aperture and annulus are comparable , then both the second and third terms will be significant ; in practice , for long exposure times , the first ( shot ) noise term will be much smaller and can be neglected .",
    "this is important as , unlike the sky noise , the shot noise depends on the magnitude of the target object itself .",
    "if its contribution to the error terms is negligible , then sky - dominated error terms can be compared between objects of different brightness on the same frame .",
    "[ step]data check    [ smallshot ]    for each object observed in each channel of each mosaic , the photometry system will have produced a count rate @xmath75 with an error , @xmath76 .",
    "for each such measurement , calculate @xmath77 and verify that it is much less than @xmath76",
    ". then one can be certain that the noise terms are dominated by sky noise rather than shot noise .      in practice , for each target object , we will have taken a number of mosaics at each angle @xmath26 .",
    "we can immediately use each pair of intensities @xmath78 to find @xmath79 and @xmath80 using equations [ idef ] and [ sdef ] .",
    "since the errors on the two channels are independent , we can trivially find the errors on both @xmath79 and @xmath80 ; the errors turn out to be identical , and are given by : @xmath81    [ cbias ] take the mean value of all the @xmath80 by summing over all the values @xmath82 at all angles @xmath26 ; and obtain an error on this mean by combining in quadrature the error on each @xmath82 .",
    "if the mean value of @xmath83 , averaged over all the angles @xmath26 , is significantly greater than the propagated error , then there may be some dc bias .",
    "check [ cbias ] uses @xmath80 as a measure of excess intensity in channel 1 over channel 2 , and relies on the fact that there are similar numbers of observations at @xmath84 and @xmath85 to average away effects due to polarization .",
    "if , as may happen in real data gathering exercises , there are not _ identical _ numbers of observations at @xmath84 and @xmath85 , this could show up as apparent ` dc bias ' in a highly polarized object . in practice , however , we are unlikely to encounter this combination of events ; testing for bias by the above method will either reveal a bias much greater than the error ( where the cause should be obvious when the original sky images are examined ) ; or a bias consistent with the random sky noise , in which case we can assume that there is no significant bias .      once we are satisfied that our raw data are not biased , we can proceed . at this stage in our data reduction",
    ", we will find it convenient to divide our set of @xmath80 values , together with their associated @xmath79 values , into the named stokes parameters , @xmath86 and @xmath87    in the rest of this paper , symbols such as @xmath82 and @xmath88 , where not followed by @xmath89 , can be read as denoting ` either @xmath90 or @xmath91 ' , ` either @xmath92 or @xmath93 ' , etc ..

    "if the errors on the individual values are not comparable , but vary widely , we may need to consider taking a weighted mean .",
    "[ maxbig ] for a set of measurements of @xmath100 , take all the measured errors , @xmath88 ; and so find the mean error ( call this @xmath101 ) and the maximum deviation of any individual error from @xmath101 . if the maximum deviation is large compared to the actual error , consider whether you need to weight the data .    if the deviations are large , we can weight each data point , @xmath82 , by @xmath102 ; but we will not pursue the subject of statistical tests on weighted means here . in practice , one normally finds that the noise does not vary widely between measurements .",
    "we have already checked ( see check [ smallshot ] ) that the shot noise is negligible compared with the sky noise terms . therefore",
    ", the main source of variation will be the sky noise .",
    "if the maximum deviation of the errors from @xmath101 is small , then we can infer that the fluctuation in the sky pixel values is similar in all the mosaics .",

    "we can propagate the errors on individual measurements through our calculations ; or we can use the standard deviation , @xmath110 , of the set of sample values , @xmath82 .    in this paper ,",
    "i use the symbol @xmath88 to denote the measured ( sky - dominated ) error on @xmath82 , and @xmath111 for the standard error on the estimated mean , @xmath112 .",
    "the standard deviation of the population , which is the expected error on a single measurement @xmath82 , could be denoted @xmath113 , but above i used @xmath101 to make its photometric derivation obvious .",
    "using statistical estimators discards the data present in the photometric noise figures and uses only the spread in the data points to estimate the errors .",
    "we would expect the statistical estimator to be of similar magnitude to the photometric error in each case ; and a cautious approach will embrace the greater of the two errors as the better error to quote in each case .    because we may be dealing with a small sample ( size @xmath114 ) for some stokes parameter , @xmath12 , the standard deviation of the sample , @xmath110 , will not be the best estimator of the population standard deviation .",
    "the best estimator is  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , for example ) : @xmath115    in this special case of the * population * standard deviation , i have used the notation @xmath116 for clarity .",
    "conventionally , @xmath35 is used for the ` best estimator ' standard deviation , but this symbol is already in use here for a general normalized stokes parameter , so in this paper i will use the variant form of sigma , @xmath117 , for errors derived from the sample standard deviation , whence @xmath118 , and the ( statistical ) standard error on the mean is @xmath119    the mean value of our stokes parameter , @xmath112 , is the best estimate of the true value @xmath120 regardless of the size of @xmath114 .",
    "given a choice of errors between @xmath111 and @xmath121 , we will cautiously take the greater of the two to be the ` best ' error , which we shall denote @xmath122 .",
    "[ noiseok ]    we now have two ways of estimating the noise on a single measurement of a stokes parameter :    @xmath123@xmath101 is the mean sky noise level obtained from our photometry system : check [ maxbig ] obtains its value and verifies that the noise levels do not fluctuate greatly about this mean .",
    "@xmath123statistical fluctuations in the actual values of the stokes parameter in question are quantified by @xmath116 , obtained by applying equation [ stateq ] to the data from step [ getmean ] .",
    "we would expect the two noise figures to be comparable , and this can be checked in our data .",
    "we may also consider photometry of other objects on the same frame : check [ smallshot ] shows us that the errors are dominated by sky noise , and @xmath66 should be comparable between objects , correcting for the different apertures used : @xmath124    we therefore take the best error , @xmath125 , on a stokes parameter , @xmath12 , to be the greater of @xmath101 and @xmath116 .",
    "if our data passes the above test , then we can be reasonably confident that the statistical tests we will outline in the next sections will not be invalidated by noise fluctuations .",
    "the linear polarization of light can be thought of as a vector of length @xmath49 and phase angle @xmath126 .",
    "there are two independent components to the polarization .",
    "if either @xmath127 or @xmath128 is non - zero , the light is said to be polarized .",
    "conversely , if the light is to be described as unpolarized , both @xmath127 and @xmath128 must be shown to be zero .    the simplest way to test whether or not our target object emits polarized light is to test whether the measured stokes parameters , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , are consistent with zero .",
    "if either parameter is inconsistent with zero , then the source can be said to be polarized .    to proceed , we must rely on our assumption ( step [ assumenorm ] ) that the sky - dominated noise causes the raw stokes parameters , @xmath129 to be distributed normally",
    ". then we can perform hypothesis testing  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 12 and 16 ) for the null hypotheses that @xmath127 and @xmath128 are zero . here , noting that the number of samples is typically small ( @xmath130 ) we face a choice :    @xmath123either : assume that the sky fluctuations are normally distributed with standard deviation @xmath101 , and perform hypothesis testing on the standard normal distribution with the statistic : @xmath131    @xmath123or : use the variation in the @xmath82 values to estimate the population standard deviation @xmath116 , and perform hypothesis testing on the student s @xmath132 distribution with @xmath133 degrees of freedom , using the statistic : @xmath134    in either case , we can perform the usual statistical test to determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis that ` @xmath135 ' , at the @xmath136 confidence level .",
    "the confidence intervals for retaining the null hypothesis will be symmetrical , and will be of the forms @xmath137 and @xmath138 .    the values of @xmath139 and @xmath140 can be obtained from tables , and we define @xmath141 to be the greater of @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    ". then the more conservative hypothesis test will reject that null hypothesis at the @xmath136 confidence level when @xmath144 .",
    "in such a confidence test , the probability of making a ` type i error ' , i.e.  of identifying an * unpolarized * target as being polarized in _",
    "one _ polarization sense , is simply @xmath145 .",
    "the probability of correctly retaining the ` unpolarized ' hypothesis is @xmath146 .",
    "the probability of making a ` type ii error '  @xcite ( i.e.  not identifying a * polarized * target as being polarized in one polarization sense ) is not trivial to calculate .    now",
    "because there are two independent senses of linear polarization , we must consider how to combine the results of tests on the two independent stokes parameters .",
    "suppose we have a source which has no linear polarization .",
    "we test the two stokes parameters , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , for consistency with zero at confidence levels @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively .",
    "the combined probability of correctly retaining the null hypothesis for both channels is @xmath149 , and that of making the type i error of rejecting the null hypothesis in either or both channels is @xmath150 .",
    "hence the overall confidence of the combined test is @xmath151 .",
    "since the null hypothesis is that @xmath44 and @xmath45 is undefined , there is no preferred direction in the null system , and therefore the confidence test should not prefer one channel over the other .",
    "hence the test must always take place with @xmath152 .",
    "even so , the test does not treat all angles equally ; the probability of a type ii error depends on the orientation of the polarization of the source .",
    "clearly if its polarization is closely aligned with a transmission axis , there is a low chance of a polarization consistent with the null hypothesis being recorded on the aligned axis , but a much higher chance of this happening on the perpendicular axis . as the alignment worsens , changing @xmath45 while keeping @xmath49 constant , the probabilities for retaining the null hypothesis on the two measurement axes approach one another .",
    "consider the case where we have taken equal numbers of measurements in the two channels , so @xmath153 , and where the errors on the measurements are all of order @xmath101 .",
    "hence we can calculate @xmath139 for the null hypothesis as above",
    ". its value will be common to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 channels , as the noise level and the number of measurements are the same in both channels .",
    "now suppose that the source has intensity @xmath154 and a true non - zero polarization @xmath49 oriented at position angle @xmath45 .",
    "then we can write @xmath155 , and @xmath156 . to generate a type ii error ,",
    "a false null result must be recorded on both axes .",
    "the probability of a false null can be calculated for specified @xmath49 and @xmath45 : defining @xmath157 then the probability of such a type ii error is @xmath158 dx\\,dy.\\ ] ] clearly this probability is not independent of @xmath45 .",
    "find the 90% confidence region limits , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , and inspect whether @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath123if both stokes parameters fall within the limits , then the target is not shown to be polarized at the 81% confidence level . in this case",
    "we can try to find polarization with some lower confidence , so repeat the test for @xmath163 .",
    "if the null hypothesis can be rejected in either channel , then we have a detection at the 72.25% confidence level .",
    "there is probably little merit in plumbing lower confidences than this .",
    "@xmath123if , however , polarization is detected in one or both of the stokes parameters at the starting point of 90% , test the polarized parameters to see if the polarization remains at higher confidences , say 95% and 97.5% .",
    "the highest confidence with which we can reject the null ( unpolarized ) hypothesis for either stokes parameter should be squared to give the confidence with which we may claim to have detected an overall polarization .    in our hypothesis testing , we have made the _ a priori _  assumption that all targets are to be assumed unpolarized until proven otherwise .",
    "this is a useful question , as we must ask whether our data are worth processing further  and we ask it using the raw stokes parameters , without resorting to complicated formulae . to publish useful results , however",
    ", we must produce the normalized stokes parameters , together with some sort of error estimate , and it is this matter which we will consider next .",
    "consider a general normalized stokes parameter for some angle , @xmath2 : @xmath164 clarke _ et al . _   point out that the signal / noise ratio obtained by calculating @xmath165 is much better than that obtained by simply taking the mean , @xmath166 since the equation [ stilde ] involves the taking of only one ratio , where the two terms @xmath112 and @xmath167 have better signal / noise ratios than the individual @xmath82 and @xmath103 which are ratioed in equation [ sbar ] .",
    "we also note that errors on @xmath112 and on @xmath167 are not independent of one another .",
    "we can write : @xmath168",
    "if we propagate through the errors on the intensities , we find : @xmath169 ^ 2 + [ ( 1+\\tilde{s})\\sigma_{\\bar{n}_{2}}]^2}.\\ ] ]    in order to simplify the calculation , we recall that in check [ maxbig ] , we checked that the errors on all the @xmath82 ( and hence @xmath103 ) were similar .",
    "thus the mean error on _ one _  rate in _",

    "the construction of a confidence interval to estimate the error is actually independent of the choice of point estimator , although ( as mentioned above ) i believe that simmons & stewart s unwillingness to ` accept sets of zero interval as confidence intervals ' is unfounded , since physical intuition allows for the possibility of truly unpolarised sources ( i.e. with identically zero polarizations ) , and their arbitrary method of avoiding zero - width intervals can be dispensed with .",

    "in addition , i have suggested that it is possible to develop the statistical technique used by simmons & stewart   to obtain a simple probability that a measured object has non - zero underlying polarization .",
    "i have also suggested that there is a form of estimator for the overall degree of linear polarization which is more generally applicable than either the maximum likelihood or the wardle & kronberg   estimators traditionally used , and which is especially relevant in cases where the measured data include degrees of polarization of order 0.7 times the estimated error .",
    "modern computer systems can estimate the noise on each individual mosaic of a sequence of images ; this is useful information , and is not to be discarded in favour of a crude statistical analysis .",
    "a recurring theme in this paper has been the comparison of the errors estimated from propagating the known sky noise , and from applying sampling theory to the measured intensities .",
    "bearing this in mind , i have presented here a process for data reduction in the form of [ findangle ] rigorous steps and checks .",
    "the recipe might be used as the basis of an automated data reduction process , and i hope that it will be of particular use to the researcher  automated or otherwise  who is attempting polarimetry for the first time ."
