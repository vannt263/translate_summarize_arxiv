    "mott insulators are insulators which are caused by electron - electron interaction rather than the crystal structure . in sufficient low temperature , long range spin or orbital order",
    "will be established to get rid of the remaining entropy induced by the unfrozen spin or orbital degree of freedoms .",
    "various types of interesting long range order may appear in different systems , i.e. the anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) order , the non - collinear spin order as well as the orbital ordering states .",
    "the fruitfulness of the long range orders in the mott insulator phases is a consequence of the detailed balance among electron kinetic energy , interaction energy and the spin orbital coupling in the solid",
    ". therefore the _ ab initio _ study of the mott insulators is very crucial to achieve quantitative understanding about these materials .    while the first principle calculations for the mott insulators based on local density approximation ( lda ) always encounter problems generated by the strong correlation effect among those partially occupied localized orbitals in these materials .",
    "for example , the lda calculation incorrectly predict two typical mott insulators @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be metallic .",
    "this is due to the non - interacting form of the lda type wave function can not capture the electron correlation effect , especially the strong on - site correlation effect in the relatively local orbitals such as @xmath2 or @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "although lda underestimates the strong correlation effects in these materials , it still describes quite well the long range coulomb interaction and those less correlated _ s p _ bands . therefore a very efficient way to solve",
    "this problem is to implement the lda with some many body techniques which can treat the correlation effect better .",
    "the first example of such scheme is the lda+u method @xcite , in which the hartree - fock mean field treatment is adopted to capture the orbital physics .",
    "the lda+u method can correctly describe many mott insulators , i.e. the @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite . while since the wave function in lda+u is still the single slater determinant , it can only capture the static orbital or spin correlation but not the dynamical correlation effect .",
    "another attempt is the lda+gutzwiller method proposed very recently by two of the authors , where the gutzwiller variational approach @xcite @xcite is used to take into account the correlation effect ( lda+g ) .",
    "lda+gutzwiller is superior to lda+u in the sense that the dynamical correlation effect can be taken into account by the multi - configuration nature of the gutzwiller trial wave function .",
    "however , lda+g is still very difficult to be used in the finite temperate problems because it is a variational method .",
    "in the past twenty years , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite has been quickly developed to be a powerful method to solve the strongly correlated models on the lattice .",
    "dmft maps the lattice models to the corresponding quantum impurity models with the environment to be determined self - consistently by the dfmt self consistent equations .",
    "dmft keeps the full local dynamics induced by the local interaction and has been successfully applied to various of correlation systems , such as the mott transition in hubbard model @xcite @xcite , the pseudo gap behavior in high tc cuperates @xcite as well as the heavy fermion system @xcite @xcite .",
    "combined with lda , the lda+dmft has quickly become a very useful numerical tool for the first principle studies of strongly correlated materials , which has been successfully applied to many strongly correlated materials .",
    "the nuclei of dmft is to solve the anderson impurity model introduced by the dmft self consistent procedure",
    ". the solver could be either numerical and analytical .",
    "the most popular two numerical solvers are exact diagonalization @xcite @xcite method and hirsh - fye quantum monte carlo @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "besides , the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) solver @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite has also been developed recently and greatly boosted the progress in this field .",
    "however , the numerical methods are often very time - consuming and for large systems it is better to use some analytical solver which is much faster and can capture the basic physics as well .",
    "the analytical solvers include hubbard - i approximation @xcite @xcite , the equation of motion ( eom ) method @xcite , the iterative perturbation theory @xcite @xcite , the fluctuation exchange approximation(flex ) @xcite and the non - crossing approximation @xcite @xcite . among them the hubbard - i solver , which simply takes the atomic self energy , is very convenient and easy to be implemented in the existing _ ab initio _ codes .",
    "since it can capture the atomic multiplet effect ( hubbard bands ) in a very efficient way , the hubbard - i solver has been widely used to study the paramagnetic mott insulators . while the hubbard - i solver can not be directly applied to the mott insulator states with long range order , simply because the atomic self energy does not contain any information about the long range order in the system . the way to solve",
    "this problem is to go beyond the atomic approximation and include the leading order corrections from the heat bath as well .",
    "a second order strong coupling expansion solver has been developed by one of the authors in reference @xcite . although the long range ordering temperature can be correctly calculated using this solver , it also suffers from the following facts .",
    "i ) because the strong coupling expansion is based on the atomic limit without long range order , it is not valid to treat the systems with large order parameter , i.e. the af phase in low temperature with the fully developed af order .",
    "ii)due to the multiple summation over the configuration space , the calculation is still quite heavy for the multi - orbial system especially the _ f_-electron system .    in order to overcome the above two problems , in this paper we propose a new scheme to include leading order corrections from the heat bath",
    "the idea is quite simple : we use the second order perturbation theory to correct the energy level of each atomic eigenstates .",
    "then we construct the  atomic \" green s function and the corresponding self energy on a single site based on the re - normalized atomic eigen - energy . with the above procedure , we can obtain the main contribution of the heat bath to the self energy in the mott insulator case , which is the re - normalization of the eigen - energy of the atomic configurations . because only the eigen - energy not the occupation of the atomic configurations is treated by second order perturbation , the present method can be applied to very low temperature with quite large order parameters . with the present impurity",
    "solver the static inter - site spin or orbital correlation , such as the super - exchange process , can be taken into account .",
    "compared with the previous atomic expansion solver , this solver does not have multiple summations over the atomic configurations , which make it very fast and is more suitable for the study of the _ f_-electron systems .",
    "the paper is organized as the following .",
    "we will present the detailed formalism of the impurity solver in section ii .",
    "after that in section iii , we will benchmark it on both paramagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic mott insulator phases in the hubbard model . and finally we will carefully discuss the results and make the conclusion .",
    "the crucial part of the dynamical mean field theory is to solve the quantum impurity model with the following hamiltonian : @xmath6 the above expression is a general form of multi - orbital anderson impurity model with arbitrary local interactions as well as the heat bath introduced by dmft self consistent procedure . in this hamiltonian , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the combined spin and orbital indices , while @xmath12 denotes the energy levels in the heat bath .    in the lda+dmft study , we often need a fast impurity solver which can capture the most important features of the impurity problem . for the mott insulators ,",
    "such a fast solver can be constructed by doing perturbation around the atomic limit . in the present paper",
    ", we apply the  contour integral `` technique to obtain the electron green s function @xcite .",
    "the retarded form of the electron green s function on the impurity site can be written as @xmath13 in the above equations , @xmath14 is a contour in the complex plane , oriented counterclockwise , and surrounding all singularities of the resolvent @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the local part of @xmath17 ; @xmath18 denotes the @xmath18th eigen state of @xmath16 with the eigen value of @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the matrix element of local fermion operator @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is a proper vertex function to be discussed below ; @xmath23 is the partition function of the impurity problem and @xmath24 can be viewed as the ' ' propagator \" of the atomic eigen states . in the absence of hybridization takes the simple form of @xmath25 .",
    "when taking the hybridization part into account , @xmath24 can be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 can be viewed as the self - energy of the @xmath18th local configuration that comes from the hybridization between the impurity site and the bath .    in order to evaluate @xmath27",
    ", we use the method heuristic from the techniques in the large - n expansion .",
    "the self energy can be expressed in a diagrammatic way as it is introduced in detail in the review @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the mott insulator system , which only requires the lowest order diagram as shown in fig [ sepic ] .",
    "the expression of self - energy corresponding to the above diagram is : @xmath28 \\label{localse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the fermi distribution function , while @xmath30 is called the hybridization function in the dynamical mean field theory and its imaginary part is denoted as @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in equation ( [ localse ] ) .",
    "afterwards , for the sake of a simplest self - consistent approximation that provides a soluble set of equations , the vertex function in eqn.([gimp ] ) could be set @xmath32 and we now get the final expression of @xmath33 in eqn.([gimp ] ) .",
    "the local electrons quasi - particle spectrum functions are the direct result of the retarded form of the green s functions . for a given hamiltonian as eqn.([himp ] ) , one may use the equations above to evaluate the green s function .",
    "implemented with the dmft self - consistent condition described in the review @xcite , this method can be used as an impurity solver in the dmft study of the multi - orbital systems with complicated local interactions .",
    "the method shown above works well for mott insulator phase , and a few results will be shown in the next section .",
    "however , here we introduce a further approximation which makes the impurity solver much faster and more convenient .",
    "the main idea of this approximation can be interpreted as the following . for a mott insulator solution in dmft with long range order ,",
    "the most important effect of the heat bath is to modify the effective energy level of the atomic configurations .",
    "therefore in the present paper , we only consider the effect of heat bath in the renormalization of the atomic levels , but neglect the possible broadening of the atomic levels .    with the above consideration , eqn.([localspectrum ] ) can be approximated as @xmath34)\\\\ & \\equiv&1/(z-\\tilde{e}_{\\alpha})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] , and @xmath35 $ ] is the renormalized atomic level containing the second order correction of the hybridization function . because the green s function @xmath24 contains only one pole at @xmath36 , as the same form in unperturbed case , we call it",
    " single pole approximation \" . thus the electron green s function can be written in a similar form as the atomic green s function @xmath37\\label{gf2 } % \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the partition function is @xmath38 .",
    "correspondingly , the self energy that comes from local two - particle interactions becomes @xmath39 this self energy can be implemented in the dmft self consistent loop and we obtained a fast impurity solver for the mott insulators with the long range order fully developed . with the current approximation ,",
    "the dmft here is equivalent to a generalized static mean field approximation using the local many - body bases .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking can be well described by the difference in energy and occupation for atomic configurations which can be connected by symmetry , i.e. the singly occupied spin up and down states in the one - band hubbard model .",
    "therefore the super - exchange process can be thus captured through the self consistently determination of the hybridization function in the dmft loop .",
    "the spectral function of one - band hubbard model with various @xmath40 at half filling is plotted in fig [ singlepara ] .",
    "it works on the bethe lattice with the semicircular density of states    @xmath41 as usual .",
    "here we do not use the  single pole approximation \" , which means eqn.([localse ] ) is implemented . as a perturbation method around atomic limit , we echo the fact that this kind of solver is limited to integer filling and large @xmath40 @xcite , that is , the present solver is just good to study in the regime of mott insulating state .    as a comparison",
    ", we also exhibit the result of present solver with and without single pole approximation compared with that of dmft+nrg , see fig [ comparenrg ] .",
    "it shows that the result of present solver at large @xmath40 regime agrees well with that of nrg , and the single pole approximation captures the main features of the hubbard bands .",
    "in this section , we study the antiferromagnetic(af)-paramagnetic phase transition in single band hubbard model at half filling .",
    "we focus on the af order parameter @xmath42 on a given sublattice the nel temperature .",
    "henceforth we use the single pole approximation , with the self energy in eqn.([se2 ] ) .",
    "first we study the single band hubbard model on the bethe lattice with the semicircular density of state .",
    "fig.[orderparameter ] shows the magnetisation @xmath7 on one sublattice versus temperature @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the curves show that the phase transition is of second order , and the critical temperatures are about @xmath46 for @xmath44 and @xmath47 for @xmath45 respectively .",
    "likewise , we get @xmath48 under different @xmath40 and plot them in fig.[tcsemi ] .",
    "this result is comparable to that of dmft+qmc in large @xmath40 regime , as it is expected .",
    "we also apply this method to estimate the nel temperature on the 3d isotropic simple cubic lattice . as the dispersion relation is @xmath49 ,",
    "we choose @xmath50 to ensure that the half band width equals to @xmath51 .",
    "it is known that , in the large @xmath40 limit , on the 3d cubic lattice , the hubbard model is equivalent to a heisenberg model with an antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath52 , and the relation between the parameters reads @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the correct nel temperature of the model is @xmath54 @xcite while the weiss mean field gives the result @xmath55 @xcite",
    ". remember that we only take the lowest order of corrections to the local interactions , so the result should be close to the one of weiss mean field , see fig [ tccubic ] .",
    "we have also plotted in this diagram the hartree - fock neel temperature for the same model @xcite , which is completely wrong in the large u limit .",
    "it is intuitive to compare our results to that of heisenberg model , because the latter has been studied intensively .",
    "for example , we have compared the antiferromagnetic condensed energy . in the antiferromagnetic spin - wave theory for heisenberg model ,",
    "this condensed energy is @xmath56 on 3d simple cubic lattice @xcite , about twice as much as @xmath57 of weiss mean field .",
    "here we have calculated the energy difference between antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic solutions , at a temperature of @xmath58 which is sufficiently low and plotted it in fig [ econdensed ] together with the condensation energy obtained by spin wave theory for the corresponding heisenberg model .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the spin wave theory which indicate that our method works very well even in low temperature .",
    "we have also studied antiferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition in two - band hubbard model at half filling , using dmft with single pole approximation . because there are two band on one single site , the situation becomes much more complicated .",
    "here we only consider the simplest case .",
    "first , we consider two degenerate band , with semicircular density of states and the band width is set to be @xmath51 .",
    "second , we neglect the hopping between different orbits .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian can be written as @xcite @xmath59 there are three adjustable parameters above , which are @xmath40 the intra - band coulomb repulsive energy , @xmath60 the inter - band coulomb energy , and @xmath52 the interaction between different bands with the same spin . for @xmath61 , the third term on the right hand side in eqn.([twobandh ] ) contains the hund s coupling @xmath62 since @xmath63 .",
    "the discussions below are based on this hamiltonian .    here",
    "we further assume @xmath64 , which is true for systems with the cubic symmetry @xcite .",
    "the nel temperatures versus various @xmath40 obtained by us for @xmath65 and @xmath66 are shown in fig.[j ] respectively .",
    "the nel temperature of two band hubbard model with @xmath67 is lower than that of one band model with the same @xmath40 .",
    "this can be understood in the way that in a two band system at half filling , there is af order developed in two different orbitals .",
    "but there is no term to lock the relative fluctuation between them , which reduces its tendency to be anti - ferromagnetic . with non - zero hund s rule coupling @xmath52",
    ", such relative fluctuation between af order in different orbitals will be greatly suppressed , which result in the dramatic increment of the nel temperature as shown in fig.[j ] .",
    "this paper presents a new impurity solver based on the perturbation theory in the hybridization around the atomic limit . for the sake of speed and convenience ,",
    "we have introduced a further  single pole approximation \" with which we carefully studied the antiferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition in one band and two band hubbard model at half filling .",
    "the dmft with the current impurity solver thus provide a way to do mean field approximation with the atomic configurations rather than energy levels for the single particle states .",
    "comparing with the dmft+qmc on the single band hubbard model , the neel temperature obtained by this new impurity solver fits quite well with the dmft+qmc results , which indicate that is can be very useful in the lda+dmft studies for mott insulators .",
