    "there is an almost absolute consensus among the particle physics community that unknown physics must exist at energies of around the tev .",
    "indeed , the minimal higgs mechanism , so far completely untested , is quite unlikely to be the true mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking ; and even if it were , an additional explanation should be provided for the stabilization of the electroweak scale .",
    "another indication of new physics around these scales is given by , for example , the dark matter problem .",
    "low - energy supersymmetry is a leading candidate to fill that gap since it provides natural and simple explanations to those conundrums .",
    "however , over the last decade , two other things have become clear .",
    "first , that the structure of flavor symmetry breaking of the standard model is a very peculiar one , and second , that , quite unexpectedly , flavor physics experiments confirm it to great accuracy . indeed ,",
    "any new physics model one can think of leads naturally to violent flavor breaking , and the experimental limits on flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) are among the most stringent constraints that any model must satisfy .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is no exception : an enormous set of new flavor violating parameters arise from its supersymmetry - breaking sector , which in the quark sector can be understood as a general misalignment between quark and squark mass matrices .",
    "more specifically , a simultaneous flavor rotation of quark and squark fields diagonalizing the yukawa matrices leads to the so called super - ckm basis , in which no tree - level fcnc couplings are present .",
    "but in this basis the squark mass matrix @xmath3 is not generally diagonal , and an extra rotation of the squark fields is necessary to diagonalize this matrix , introducing strong interaction flavor violating couplings .",
    "therefore , susy contributions to flavor violating observables mediated by strong interactions will easily compete with the sm contributions , which are driven by weak interactions , and well tested experimentally .",
    "flavor constraints on these flavor violating parameters have been studied extensively , and the conclusion to be taken from those studies is , basically , that it is quite difficult to reconcile the relatively low susy masses required by naturalness with a generic flavor structure of the soft breaking terms .",
    "a solution to this problem is to assume that the structure of flavor violation of the new physics respects the hypothesis of minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , by virtue of which the yukawa couplings are the only source of flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "however , this is quite a pessimistic scenario for new physics searches in the quark sector , and it is useful for many purposes to go beyond it . indeed , present indications of new physics in @xmath4 and @xmath5 processes @xcite seem to require a departure from mfv .    in the mssm , a suitable approach for phenomenological studies that takes into consideration all these issues , is to assume that squark masses are very nearly degenerate .",
    "this case is parametrized by a squark mass matrix of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an `` average '' squark mass , and @xmath8 is a matrix with entries much smaller than one .",
    "these small parameters , or _ mass insertions _ , parametrize the departure from mfv , and constraints on their values derived from flavor observables provide valuable information for model building .",
    "they are usually treated as expansion parameters , which at leading order ( linear and quadratic in @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath1 processes respectively ) , define what is coventionally know as the _ mass insertion approximation _ ( mia ) @xcite .",
    "strong bounds have been derived for these quantities from fcnc processes @xcite and vacuum stability requirements @xcite as well as from charged - current processes @xcite .    however , it is also of interest to consider other scenarios with non - degenerate squark masses .",
    "for example , it has been argued that a `` hierarchical '' setup in which the first two generations of squarks are much heavier than the rest of the susy spectrum ( lying near the electroweak scale ) , can satisfy naturalness criteria @xcite . in this framework , correlation patterns between @xmath9 and @xmath1 observables can be quite different from the ones in the degenerate case . indeed , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in these scenarios the bounds from @xmath10 can be partially evaded , allowing for a large @xmath11 mixing phase .",
    "this would be of great relevance if the experimental indication for such a large phase @xcite is confirmed .    in order to perform",
    "phenomenological studies of these scenarios , corresponding calculations of flavor violating processes have to be performed . here",
    "we focus on @xmath1 processes , that is , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mixing .",
    "these low energy observables are more conveniently computed in the framework of an effective theory in which heavy modes have been integrated out .",
    "the most general effective hamiltonian relevant for @xmath1 processes is given in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) , where the wilson coefficients @xmath15 contain the information from heavy modes .",
    "then the observables are expressed as functions of the wilson coefficients and the matrix elements of the operators , and arise from the @xmath1 amplitude in the effective theory : @xmath16 where we have written the matrix elements of the operators in terms of tree level matrix elements @xmath17 .",
    "the matrix elements must be computed using some non - perturbative approach , for example in the lattice .",
    "the susy contributions are encoded inside the wilson coefficients , which are evaluated by matching the full theory ( mssm ) onto the effective theory at some matching scale @xmath18 . according to the renormalization group ( rg ) prescription for the resummation of large logarithms ,",
    "the matching scale @xmath18 must be close to the susy scale , and the scale at which matrix elements are computed must be close to a relevant mass scale in the effective theory ( for example @xmath19 in the case of @xmath20 mixing ) , and the wilson coefficients at the matching scale must be used as initial conditions for the rg evolution that provides the wilson coefficients at the low scale .",
    "this evolution is governed in particular by the anomalous dimensions of the operators .",
    "leading order ( lo ) strong interaction matching conditions in the mssm have been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and arise from the squark - gluino box diagrams shown in appendix  [ applo ] . the corresponding next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "corrections arise from the two loop diagrams shown in appendices  [ appir ] - [ appfin ] , and have been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the mass insertion approximation .",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix for the complete set of operators ( eq .  ( [ ops ] ) ) has been computed at nlo in qcd in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the computation of the nlo matching conditions beyond the mia , in the presence of arbitrary soft terms , and in particular for arbitrary squark mass splittings .",
    "the motivation for a nlo determination of the matching conditions is three - fold .",
    "first , lo matching conditions are both scale- and scheme - independent , so in order to get scheme independent results and nlo scale invariance it is necessary to go beyond the leading order .",
    "second , the leading order corrections are proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "since at lo neither the renormalization scale or the scheme can be specified for the strong coupling , lo results show a particularly high uncertainty related to the scheme and scale ambiguities .",
    "third , this uncertainty is particularly severe due to the large anomalous dimensions of the @xmath1 operators involved .",
    "these uncertainties are largely cured by the nlo corrections , from about 10 - 15% to a few percent , as shown explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 amplitude in the mssm up to nlo can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the lo and nlo contributions , and we have factored out a common @xmath21 .",
    "the matching of the full theory onto the effective theory is performed by imposing that the effective and mssm amplitudes are equal at and below a matching scale @xmath18 .",
    "an order by order identification of eqs .",
    "( [ aeff ] ) and ( [ afull ] ) leads to the following formula for the wilson coefficients : @xmath25 thus , the nlo matching calculation requires the computation of the matrix @xmath26 and the functions @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 is obtained from the renormalization of the operators of the effective theory , and its computation is described in section  [ sec : heff ] .",
    "this matrix has been computed before in several renormalization schemes ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and we agree with their results .",
    "the functions @xmath27 are obtained computing the one- and two - loop diagrams in the mssm ( see appendix  [ app1 ] ) .",
    "the details of this computation are described in section  [ sec : det ] , and the functions @xmath24 obtained here are the main new results of this paper .",
    "both calculations , the effective and the full theory amplitudes , are carried out in the ndr scheme ( dimensional regularization with anticommuting @xmath28 ) , with modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath29 ) of ultraviolet divergencies .",
    "also , we choose massless external quarks with zero external momenta .",
    "this choice of external states introduces infrared ( ir ) divergencies from diagrams in which a gluon connects two external legs .",
    "we regularize these divergencies with an unphysical gluon mass @xmath30 . while both @xmath26 and @xmath24 depend on the external states ( and are therefore ir divergent ) , this dependence cancels in the wilson coefficients , as expected .    after describing the computation of the relevant amplitudes ,",
    "we discuss briefly in section  [ sec : ren ] some issues related to the renormalization of ultraviolet divergencies and the renormalization scale dependence . in section",
    "[ sec : checks ] we mention some of the checks that can be done to ensure the correctness of the results . in section  [ sec : mia ] we show how reduce the exact results to the mia and to the mia with non - degenerate squarks , which allows to compare our results with those in ref .",
    "finally , some results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] .    before getting down to brass tacks",
    ", we would like to set some notation and specify some definitions related with rotation and mass matrices beyond leading order . at tree level ,",
    "the super - ckm basis is defined by doing a joint rotation in flavor space of quark and squark fields such as to diagonalize the tree level yukawa matrices .",
    "the resulting squark mass matrix is not diagonal and defines the tree level mass insertions . in this basis",
    "there are no tree level fcnc s .",
    "this matrix is diagonalized by an additional rotation of the squark fields , @xmath31 where @xmath32 denote the squark fields in the ( tree level ) super - ckm basis , and @xmath33 is the mass eigenbasis .",
    "the rotation matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 matrices , and the indices @xmath37 will be omitted hereon , which raises no confusion . in the mass",
    "eigenbasis , tree level fcnc s appear ; for example a flavor changing @xmath38-@xmath39-@xmath40 vertex is generated with the following feynman rule : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the color matrices and @xmath43 are the chiral projectors .    at nlo ,",
    "a subtlety arises because a squark - gluino loop generates a finite flavor - changing self energy for the quark fields ( see fig .",
    "[ fcse ] ) . at this point",
    ", one must specify what is meant by the super - ckm basis at nlo , since the definitions for the mass insertions depend on that choice .",
    "we believe that the most natural definition for the super - ckm basis is the one for which quark fields do not mix at one loop , and tree - level fcnc s are absent . in this case",
    "the rotation matrices , the mass insertions and the ckm matrix differ from the tree level ones",
    ". this criterium does not coincide with that in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it has no effect when comparing our results with ref .",
    "@xcite , since this is not an issue in the degenerate case .",

    "@xcite is that mass insertions are directly related with susy - breaking parameters in the lagrangian .",

    ", one must specify a renormalization scheme . here",
    "we choose to regularize ultraviolet divergencies in dimensional regularization , where @xmath54 identities between operators do not hold .",
    "this means that one must complete the effective hamiltonian with a set of evanescent operators that vanish in 4 dimensions but can give finite contributions beyond leading order if they are multiplied by a divergence .",
    "the choice of a set of evanescent operators is not unique , and different sets lead to different subtractions , so specifying this set is necessary to fix the renormalization scheme . here",
    "we choose the set of evanescent operators given in ref .",
    "@xcite . by requiring that the matrix elements of evanescent operators vanish in four dimensions",
    "one can omit these operators altogether from the effective hamiltonian once the renormalization has been performed .",
    "the calculation of the nlo effective hamiltonian amounts basically to the nlo renormalization of the operators .",
    "the matrix elements of the bare operators and of the renormalized operators are related through the renormalization constants : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the quark wave function renormalization factors and @xmath57 is the renormalization matrix necessary to renormalize properly the operators in the effective theory .",
    "the effective theory amplitude can then be written as @xmath58 where we have written @xmath59 and the second term contains the counterterms . in order to obtain the nlo renormalized operators @xmath60 in terms of tree level matrix elements",

    "however it can be easily translated to dimensional reduction ( dred ) and regularization - independent ( ri ) schemes by using the formulae in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fact , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the matrix @xmath26 can be thought of as _ defining _ the renormalization scheme , and eq .",

    "the same scheme must be used in the full theory calculation and in the evaluation of the matrix elements in order to obtain scheme - independent results for physical amplitudes .",
    "the nlo @xmath1 amplitude in the mssm is obtained by computing the one- and two - loop feyman diagrams listed in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "the one - loop contributions are the box diagrams shown in appendix [ applo ] ; the computation of these graphs is standard and will not be reviewed here .",
    "renormalization of the two - loop diagrams requires the inclusion of these boxes with vertex counterterms , as well as pentagons containing the self - energy counterterms .",
    "these one loop integrals must then be computed up to and including terms of @xmath65 , which provide the finite scale- and scheme - dependent contributions to the nlo amplitude .",

    "4 .   fierz rearrangement and spinor transpositions in order to express the spinor structures in terms of tree level matrix elements of the operators .",
    "let us describe in some detail each of these steps .",
    "since we are choosing massless quarks with zero external momenta , there are only two independent momenta appearing in the feynman integrals .",
    "one can then decompose the denominators such that each diagram can be expressed as a sum of terms of the following type @xmath78 where the @xmath79 s are some functions that depend in general on all the masses appearing in the feynman diagram ( including the fictitious gluon mass ) , and @xmath80 . also , @xmath81 and @xmath82 represent dirac and color structures .",

    "for example , @xmath87 in this way we can express each diagram as a sum of terms of the form @xmath88 at this point , care must be taken when manipulating the dirac structures @xmath81 and @xmath82 after contraction with the metric tensors . in particular , in @xmath89 dimensions ,",

    "the resulting scalar integrals can be further reduced to a set of one- and two - loop master integrals by the method of recurrence relations @xcite .",

    "one - loop corrections are finite , no @xmath98 divergencies can appear , so all @xmath98 terms should ( and do ) cancel directly .",
    "we also get automatic cancellation of @xmath99 terms for the diagrams shown in appendix [ appfin ] , as it should be .",
    "the rest of the diagrams ( those shown in appendix [ appuv ] ) contain @xmath99 divergencies that cancel against one - loop diagrams with vertex and self - energy counterterms .",
    "we will discuss the details of the renormalization in section [ sec : ren ] .",
    "after all the divergencies have been removed , 4d fierz identities can be used and transposition of spinors can be performed to put all spinor and dirac structures in suitable form . these structures must then appear in the precise combinations that constitute the tree level matrix elements of the physical operators , as for example , @xmath100 this , however , does not occur for individual diagrams , but only for certain groups of diagrams ( and of course for the amplitude as a whole ) . therefore this step provides an interesting check of the calculation , in particular of the relative sign between the different diagrams .",
    "the nlo quantities @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ afull ] ) are then obtained by summing all the contributions .",
    "in order to reduce the ultraviolet divergencies arising from the two - loop graphs , appropriate counterterms must be introduced . in particular , the squark - quark - gluino vertex , as well as the quark , squark and gluino wave functions and masses have to be renormalized . for reference ,",
    "the relevant renormalization factors in the @xmath62-ndr scheme up to @xmath101 are @xmath102 @xmath103 which are defined in the usual way .",
    "also , a non - diagonal squark - mass counterterm is necessary , because at one loop divergent flavor - changing squark propagators are generated .",
    "there are two ways of dealing with this issue : 1 ) renormalize the squark rotation matrices so that non - diagonal squark masses are zero at one loop . in this case",

    "there is an additional issue related with the fact that ndr is a regularization scheme that breaks supersymmetry . in particular ,",
    "the coupling @xmath106 appearing in the quark - gluon - gluon vertex and the coupling @xmath107 that appears in the quark - squark - gluino vertex , receive different radiative corrections in the ndr scheme . in the effective theory",
    "only @xmath106 appears , so when doing the matching it is convenient to have the mssm amplitude expressed solely in terms of this coupling .",
    "being this is an @xmath101 effect , one can set @xmath108 in the two - loop amplitude , but it gives a finite contribution of @xmath109 from the lo amplitude . at the end , this effect is corrected for by performing in the one loop amplitude the following replacement ( see @xcite ) , @xmath110    finally , one must address the wave - function renormalization of the external states .",

    "cancellation of ir divergences : both the amplitude in the effective theory and the amplitude in the mssm depend on @xmath123 , where @xmath30 is the gluon mass introduced to regularize the ir divergencies .",

    "we will expand in the external momentum , which is justified by the fact that the susy masses are much higher than the external quark masses .",
    "then , the self energies we are interested in are given by @xmath217 with @xmath218 .",
    "where , in the approximation @xmath221 , and keeping only the chirally enhanced terms , @xmath222 \\pi_l^{is*}&=&\\gamma_l^{id*}\\ \\sigma_{sd}^{rl}/m_s -\\gamma_l^{ib*}\\ \\sigma_{sb}^{lr}/m_b   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and correspondingly for @xmath50 .    at this point , we denote by @xmath223 the squark rotation matrices associated with the tree - level definition of the super - ckm basis , and @xmath81 the rotation matrices in the on - shell case . at tree - level",

    "the full results for the nlo wilson coefficients in terms of @xmath223 corresponding to the tree - level definition of the super - ckm basis can be obtained by making the substitutions of eq .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) in the lo expressions given in eq .",
    "( [ lowc ] ) .    in the degenerate mia case , these corrections cancel .",

    "( [ rel1 ] ) .",
    "the same happens with the other two terms arising from the @xmath228 , and in the other wilson coefficients .",
    "therefore , the two bases coincide in the mass insertion approximation with degenerate squarks .    finally , the relationship between the mass insertions defined in each basis can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) and ( [ rotrel ] ) .",

    "analogue relations for other mass insertions can be found accordingly . from this last relation",

    "the effect of the squark - gluino corrections to the external legs ( or the difference between the two definitions of the super - ckm basis ) , turns out to be numerically important because of the chiral enhancement .",
    "while this article was under revision , a phenomenological study of these corrections has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the conclusion that the bounds on some mass insertions ( corresponding to the tree - level definition of the super - ckm basis ) are modified considerably .",
    "these corrections have obviously no effect on the phenomenological bounds derived for the mass insertions associated to the on - shell definition of the super - ckm basis , and in this scheme the nlo corrections are well defined in the limit of vanishing quark masses . however , it is _ not _ a claim of the present paper that the on - shell scheme is in any way preferred to the tree - level one .",
    "in fact , the tree level scheme might be more convenient if one wishes to relate phenomenological bounds on these type of low energy processes to specific mechanisms of susy breaking .",
    "this issue has been already discussed in ref .",
