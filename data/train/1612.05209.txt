    "capacitively coupled plasma ( ccp ) radio frequency discharges are frequently used for applications such as plasma etching or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) processes in integrated circuit manufacturing .",
    "impact by energetic electrons leads to dissociation and ionization of feedstock gas , and thus creation of reactive radicals and ions .",
    "these applications usually require feedstock gases that are complex mixtures of reactive gases , often electronegative .",
    "one such electronegative discharge is the oxygen discharge .",
    "the oxygen discharge and its mixtures are of significance in various materials processing applications including etching of polymer films , ashing of photoresist , oxidation , and deposition of oxide films .",
    "the oxygen chemistry is complicated due to the presence of metastable atomic and molecular species .",
    "it is in particular the two low lying metastable molecular states designated by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are located 0.98 and 1.627 ev above the ground state , respectively , that play an important role .",
    "it is well established that collisions with these metastable states have in many cases larger cross sections and thus higher reaction rates than corresponding collisions with the ground state molecule .",
    "a volume averaged global model is an approach to get a detailed description of the plasma chemistry in low pressure discharges .",
    "global model studies show that the dominant species in the oxygen discharge is the oxygen molecule in the ground state , o@xmath0(x@xmath5 ) , followed by the oxygen atom in the ground state , o(@xmath6p ) .",
    "the singlet metastable states o@xmath0(a@xmath1 ) and o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) and the metastable atom o(@xmath7d ) are also present in the plasma in significant amounts @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent study shows that the o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) density can overcome the o@xmath0(a@xmath1 ) density in the pressure range below 100 mtorr @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath8-ions are in majority among the positive ions and the o@xmath9-ion density is much smaller and has a sharp decrease for pressures above 4 mtorr .",
    "it is also seen that the negative ion density ratio [ o@xmath10/[o@xmath11 is 5.3 at 1 mtorr , and 1.3 at 100 mtorr @xcite .",
    "such global models studies neglect spatial variations in the plasma parameters as well as the kinetics of the discharge .",
    "they allow us to explore the relative reaction rates for the creation and destruction of particular species over the pressure range of interest and therefore which reactions are of significance .    to explore the kinetics of the discharge we apply particle - in - cell monte carlo collision ( pic / mcc ) simulations . in a pic / mcc simulation",
    "the plasma is represented as a collection of macro - particles .",
    "equations of motion are solved for each macro - particle .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are calculated self - consistently using charge densities and currents produced by these macro - particles .",
    "we use the oopd1 ( object oriented plasma device for one dimension ) code to simulate the discharge .",
    "it has one dimension in space and three velocity components for the particles ( 1d-3v ) .",
    "the oopd1 code is supposed to replace the widely used xpdx1 series ( xpdp1 , xpdc1 and xpds1 ) .",
    "it was developed to simulate various types of plasmas , including processing discharges , accelerators and beams .",
    "the code is written in modular structure and it includes features such as relativistic kinematics and different weights for different species .",
    "earlier we developed a basic oxygen discharge model and benchmarked it against the well known xpdp1 code @xcite .",
    "later we explored adding the singlet metastable molecule o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) and the metastable oxygen atom o(@xmath7d ) to the reaction set @xcite .",
    "there we demonstrated that the addition of the singlet metastable molecule o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) has a significant influence on the discharge , such as on the electronegativity , the effective electron temperature , and the electron heating processes for a pressure of 50 mtorr .",
    "we found that it is , in particular , detachment by the metastable molecule o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) that has a significant influence on the discharge properties .",
    "in a subsequent study we explored how the addition of the singlet metastable molecule o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) modified the discharge properties in the pressure range 10  500 mtorr @xcite .",
    "we found that at low pressure ( 10 mtorr ) , ohmic ( collisional ) heating in the plasma bulk dominates and the heating mechanism evolves through a phase where both ohmic heating in the bulk and sheath oscillation ( collisionless ) heating contribute , and at higher pressure ( 50  500 mtorr ) , the electron heating occurs almost solely in the sheath region . at the higher pressures , detachment by the metastable singlet molecule o@xmath0(a@xmath12 )",
    "has a significant influence on the electron heating process but at the lowest pressures detachment by o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) has only a small influence on the heating process . at low pressure ,",
    "the electron energy probability function ( eepf ) is convex and as the pressure is increased the number of low energy electrons increases and the number of higher energy electrons ( @xmath13 ev ) decreases , and the eepf develops a concave shape or becomes bi - maxwellian @xcite .",
    "this contradicts what is observed for a capacitively coupled argon discharge where the eepf evolves from being concave at low pressure to become convex at high pressure @xcite and for the chlorine discharge where the eepf is found to be convex in the pressure range of 10  100 mtorr @xcite . in a more recent study we added the singlet metastable oxygen molecule o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) to the reaction set @xcite .",
    "we find that including the singlet metastable o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) further decreases the ohmic heating in the electronegative core and the effective electron temperature in the bulk region .",
    "the effective electron temperature in the electronegative core is found to be less than 1 ev in the pressure range 50  200 mtorr which agrees with recent experimental findings .",
    "furthermore , we have added an energy - dependent secondary electron emission yield for the positive oxygen ions o@xmath8 and o@xmath9 as well as the neutrals o@xmath0 and o @xcite .",
    "we find that including an energy - dependent secondary electron emission yield for o@xmath14-ions has a significant influence on the discharge properties , including decreased sheath width and increased electron density @xcite .",
    "other pic / mcc studies of the oxygen discharge have also indicated a significant role of the singlet metastable state o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) and in particular the detachment by the o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) on the overall discharge properties @xcite .",
    "however , these studies did not include a complete reaction set for creation and destruction of the metastable states and the metastables are not treated kinetically .    here",
    ", we investigate the spatio - temporal electron heating dynamics in a geometrically symmetric oxygen discharge by 1d-3v pic / mcc simulations .",
    "in particular we explore the influence of the electron detachment from the negative ion o@xmath15 by the singlet molecular metastables o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) and o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) on the spatio - temporal electron heating dynamics , the electronegativity , and the effective electron temperature .",
    "we assume a capacitively coupled discharge where one of the electrodes is driven by an rf voltage ( left hand electrode ) while the other ( right hand electrode ) is grounded .",
    "we assume the discharge to be operated at a single frequency of 13.56 mhz , and voltage amplitude of @xmath16 v with an electrode separation of 4.5 cm and a capacitor of 1 f in series with the voltage source .",
    "the simulation grid is uniform and consists of 1000 cells .",
    "the electron time step is @xmath17 s. the simulation was run for @xmath18 time steps or 2750 rf cycles . for the heavy particles we use sub - cycling and the heavy particles",
    "are advanced every 16 electron time steps @xcite .",
    "we assume that the initial density profiles are parabolic .",
    "we consider an oxygen discharge that consists of : electrons , the ground state oxygen molecule o@xmath19x@xmath20 , the metastable oxygen molecules o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) , and o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) , the ground state oxygen atom o(@xmath6p ) , the metastable oxygen atom o(@xmath7d ) , the negative oxygen ion o@xmath15 , and the positive oxygen ions o@xmath9 and o@xmath8 .",
    "the basic reaction set and cross sections included in the oopd1 code for the oxygen discharge excluding the metastable states is discussed in an earlier work and includes reactions among electrons , ground state molecules , ground state atoms , negative ions o@xmath15 , and positive ions o@xmath9 and o@xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the combined reaction set discussed in these three publications @xcite is referred to as the full reaction set in the discussion below .",
    "the reactions explored here in particular are detachment by the singlet metastable molecule o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) @xmath21 and detachment by the metastable o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) @xmath22 for the detachment by the metastable o@xmath0(@xmath23 ) we use the rate coefficient measured at 400 k of @xmath24 m@xmath25/s by midey et al .",

    "is estimated from the rate coefficient of @xmath33 m@xmath6/s , given by @xcite and then we allow it to fall as @xmath26 for @xmath34 mev and then remain constant .",
    "the neutral gas density is much higher than the densities of charged species , so the neutral species at thermal energies ( below a certain cut - off energy ) are treated as a background with fixed density and temperature and maintained uniformly in space .",
    "these neutral background species are assumed to have a maxwellian velocity distribution at the gas temperature ( here  @xmath35 = 26 mv ) . in the oxygen discharge ,",
    "the densities of the metastable oxygen molecules o@xmath0(a@xmath12 ) and o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) , oxygen atom in the ground state o(@xmath6p ) and the metastable oxygen atom o(@xmath7d ) are much larger than the number of charged species .",

    "<S> we use the one - dimensional object - oriented particle - in - cell monte carlo collision code oopd1 to explore the spatio - temporal evolution of the electron heating mechanism in a capacitively coupled oxygen discharge in the pressure range 10  200 mtorr . </S>",
    "<S> the electron heating is most significant in the sheath vicinity during the sheath expansion phase . </S>",
    "<S> we explore how including and excluding detachment by the singlet metastable states o@xmath0(a@xmath1 ) and o@xmath0(b@xmath2 ) influences the heating mechanism , the effective electron temperature and electronegativity , in the oxygen discharge . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the detachment processes have a significant influence on the discharge properties , in particular for the higher pressures . at 10 mtorr </S>",
    "<S> the time averaged electron heating shows mainly ohmic heating in the plasma bulk ( the electronegative core ) and at higher pressures there is no ohmic heating in the plasma bulk , that is electron heating in the sheath regions dominates . </S>"
