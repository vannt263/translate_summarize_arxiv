    "since their inception nearly two decades ago , gauge / string dualities keep generating profound insights into strongly - coupled gauge theories and have led to new perspectives and groundbreaking results over a broad range of physics subfields @xcite .    among the pioneering and most",
    "intensely studied application areas for these holographic dualities is qcd , the theory of the strong interactions , in its infrared regime .",
    "hence , various increasingly sophisticated and realistic string - theory - based ( i.e. `` top - down '' ) dual candidates for strongly - coupled large-@xmath3 yang - mills theories and qcd were constructed . in order to be at least halfway accessible by contemporary solution methods ,",
    "most of them use the gravity approximation for the string dynamics .",
    "this requires weak bulk spacetime curvatures and entails several well - understood limitations @xcite e.g. in the description of asymptotic freedom or linear regge trajectories .",
    "even within these restrictions , however , the technical ( and sometimes conceptual ) complexities encountered when attempting to calculate gauge - theory quantities beyond approximate mass spectra can be quite formidable .",
    "part of these problems arise from the absence of analytical solutions for even the simplest bulk quantities in practically all top - down duals .",
    "moreover , numerical approaches provide no fully satisfactory alternative .",
    "the numerical evaluation of more complex amplitudes like correlators is e.g. typically hampered by renormalization issues and often requires specifically designed , non - universal methods .",
    "in addition , numerical results reveal less of the underlying mathematical structure whose patterns and systematics often provide useful insights and intuitive guidance .",
    "to improve this situation , we intend to develop and adapt more sophisticated analytical approximation methods to deal with top - down gravity duals .",
    "they should be controlled ( i.e. systematically improveable ) and as transparent and universally applicable as possible .",
    "in particular , they should provide accurate analytical expressions for a complete set of dual quantities from which analytical results for all desired gauge - theory observables can be derived .",
    "in this letter we propose the whole tower of ( normalizable ) dual string modes , corresponding to the `` hadrons '' of interest , as a promising such set .    in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in witten s top - down gravity dual for three - dimensional yang - mills theory ( ym@xmath4 ) @xcite which emerges from @xmath3 parallel , non - extremal @xmath5 branes of type iib string theory in the near - horizon limit , with one of its flat dimensions compactified on a circle .",
    "this dual model suggests itself for our purposes because it is technically simple and reproduces important properties of the gluonic sector of qcd ( including confinement ) .",
    "in ref . @xcite , witten proposed a string dual for @xmath6 yang - mills theory in @xmath7 dimensions at large @xmath3 and for large t hooft coupling @xmath8 .",
    "this dual is based on the ads / cft correspondence between @xmath9 superconformal yang - mills theory in @xmath10 dimensions and a stack of @xmath3 coincident @xmath5-brane solutions of type iib string theory in 10 dimensions ( with r - r charge * @xmath3 * ) , or for small spacetime curvature by iib supergravity @xcite .",
    "conformal symmetry and supersymmetry are broken by generalizing the correspondence to non - extremal @xmath5 black - brane solutions with * * hawking temperature @xmath11 .",
    "one then decouples the near - horizon or `` throat '' region from the 10d minkowski gravity ( staying outside the horizon ) and analytically continues to euclidean time @xmath12 .",
    "this requires to periodically identify @xmath13 on the circle @xmath14 and to remove a cone singularity in the @xmath15 subspace by fixing the hawking temperature to @xmath16 with the horizon at @xmath17 . in the fefferman - graham",
    "coordinate @xmath18 , the metric then becomes @xmath19+r^{2}d\\omega_{5}^{2}\\label{eq : ads - bb}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is reinterpreted as the euclidean time .",
    "( the associated dilaton is constant . )    on the gauge - theory side the above procedure corresponds to compactifying the euclidean @xmath9 @xmath6 super - yang - mills theory ( i.e. the low - energy theory of the @xmath3 coinciding @xmath5 branes ) on @xmath21 , with anti - periodic , supersymmetry - breaking boundary conditions for the fermions around @xmath22 .",
    "hence the adjoint fermions acquire tree - level masses @xmath23 ( thus breaking conformal symmetry ) and render the scalar matter massive at the one - loop level . for sufficiently small @xmath24 the adoint matter decouples and",
    "only the gauge fields on @xmath25 remain massless ( protected by the gauge symmetry ) , with their dynamics approaching ym@xmath4 ( with an uv cutoff @xmath23 ) .",
    "the background geometry ( [ eq : ads - bb ] ) is dual to the gauge - theory vacuum .",
    "its scalar excitations , the @xmath26 `` glueballs '' , are associated with the ( gauge - invariant ) operator @xmath27 which in turn is dual to a bulk field with identical quantum numbers .",
    "the corresponding deformation @xmath28 of the gauge - theory action changes the yang - mills coupling @xmath29 and thus the ( boundary ) value @xmath30 of the dilaton field @xmath31 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath31 is the bulk field dual to @xmath32 . @xmath33",
    "the gkpw relation @xcite then identifies the generating functional of the glueball correlation functions as @xmath34=\\left\\langle e^{\\int d^{4}x\\varphi^{\\left(s\\right)}\\left(x\\right)\\mathcal{o}{}_{0^{++}}\\left(x\\right)}\\right\\rangle \\overset{n\\gg\\lambda\\gg1}{\\longrightarrow}e^{-s^{\\left(onsh\\right)}\\left[\\varphi^{\\left(s\\right)}\\left(x\\right)=\\varphi\\left(z=0,x\\right)\\right]}\\label{eq : gfun}\\ ] ] with the string partition function in the classical limit .",
