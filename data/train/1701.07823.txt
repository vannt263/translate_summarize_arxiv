    "skeletal muscle tissue is one of the main components of the human body , being about 40% of its total mass .",
    "its principal role is the production of _ force _ , which supports the body and becomes _ movement _ by acting on bones .",
    "the mechanism by which a muscle produces force is called _",
    "skeletal muscle tissue is a highly ordered hierarchical structure .",
    "the cells of the tissue are the muscular fibers , having a length up to several centimeters ; they are organized in fascicles , where every fiber is multiply connected to nerve axons , which drive the activation of the tissue .",
    "connective tissue , which is essentially isotropic , fills the spaces among the fibers .",
    "every fiber contains a concatenation of millions of sarcomeres , which are the fundamental unit of the muscle . with a length of some micrometers ,",
    "a sarcomere is composed by chains of proteins , mainly actin and myosin , which can slide on each other .",
    "this sliding movement produces the contraction of the sarcomere and , ultimately , the contraction of the whole muscle and the production of force and movement .    the aim of this chapter is to propose a mathematical model of skeletal muscle tissue with a reduced activation , which is typical of a geriatric syndrome named _ sarcopenia _ @xcite .",
    "about thirty years ago , the term sarcopenia ( from greek _ sarx _ or flesh and _ penia _ or loss ) has been introduced in order to describe the age - related decrease of muscle mass and performance .",
    "sarcopenia has since then been defined as the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength that occurs with advancing age , which in turn affects balance , gait and overall ability to perform even the simple tasks of daily living such as rising from a chair or climbing steps .",
    "according to @xcite , sarcopenia affects more than 50 millions people today and it will affect more than 200 millions in the next 40 years . there is still no generally accepted test for its diagnosis and many efforts are made nowadays by the medical community to better understand this syndrome .",
    "therefore it is desirable to build a mathematical model of muscle tissue affected by sarcopenia .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , in the biomathematical literature the topic of loss of activation has never been addressed .    in order to use the valuable tools of continuum mechanics , during the last decades",
    "the skeletal muscle tissue has been often modeled as a continuum material @xcite , which is usually assumed to be transversely isotropic and incompressible .",
    "the former assumption is motivated by the alignment of the muscular fibers , while the latter is ensured by the high water content of the tissue ( about 75% of the total volume ) . moreover , in view of some experimental tests , the material is assumed to be nonlinear and viscoelastic . focusing our attention only on the steady properties of the tissue , here we neglect the viscous effects and we set in the framework of hyperelasticity .",
    "in the model that we propose , there are three constitutive prescriptions : one for the hyperelastic energy when the tissue is not active ( _ passive energy _ ) , one for the activation and one for the loss of performance .",
    "as far as the passive part is concerned , we assume an exponential stress response of the material , which is customary in biological tissues .",
    "the particular form that we choose , being a slight simplification of the one proposed in  @xcite , has the advantage of being polyconvex and coercive , giving mathematical soundness to the model and stability to the numerical simulations .    a recent and very promising way to describe",
    "the activation is the _ active strain _ approach , where the extra energy produced by the activation mechanism is encoded in a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient in an elastic and an active part ( see section  [ d : subsec : activestrainmodel ] ) . unlike the classical _ active stress _",
    "approach , in which the active part of the stress is modeled in a pure phenomenological way and a new term has to be added to the passive energy , the active strain method does not change the form of the elastic energy , keeping in particular all its mathematical properties . moreover , at least in the case of skeletal muscles , the active strain approach seems to be more adherent to the physiology of the tissue , in the sense that at the molecular level the production of force is actually given by a deformation of the material , thanks to the contraction of the sarcomeres .",
    "the active part of the deformation gradient is a mathematical representation of such a contraction .",
    "the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient has been applied to an active striated muscle in @xcite .",
    "however , this decomposition involves only a part of the whole elastic energy , which is written as the sum of two terms for the case of a fiber - reinforced material .",
    "as far as we know , the active strain approach has never been previously applied to the whole elastic energy of a skeletal muscle tissue . as a drawback",
    ", the active strain approach can be a source of some technical difficulties ; for instance , in our case fitting the model on the experimental data is not so simple , see eq .  .",
    "furthermore , we consider the loss of performance , which is one of the novelties of our model .",
    "unfortunately , there are no experimental data on the elastic properties of a sarcopenic muscle tissue , at least to our knowledge ; hence we adopt the naive strategy of reducing the active part of the stress ( which is the difference between the stress of the material with and without activation ) by a given percentage , represented by the damage parameter @xmath0 ( see section  [ d : subsec : lossactivation ] ) . in this way",
    ", there is a single parameter in the model which concisely accounts for any effect of the disease .",
    "the proposed model can be numerically implemented using finite element methods . in section",
    "[ d : sec : numerical ] we present some results obtained using fenics , an open source collection of python libraries .",
    "actually , we consider a cylindrical geometry with radial symmetry , so that the numerical domain is two - dimensional and the computational cost is reduced . as far as the boundary conditions are concerned , we prescribe the displacement on the bases of the cylinder and let the lateral surface traction - free .",
    "such simulations show that the experimental results of  @xcite on the passive and active stress - strain healthy curves , obtained _ in vivo _ from a tetanized tibialis anterior of a rat , can be well reproduced by our model .",
    "further , the behavior of the tissue when @xmath0 increases is analyzed .",
    "an ongoing task is to perform a finite element implementation of the model when generic loads are applied , and to consider a realistic three - dimensional muscle mesh .",
    "we are now developing a truly hyperelastic model , where the expression of the stress takes into account also the dependence of the activation on the deformation gradient .",
    "actually , in this chapter the stress is computed as the derivative of the hyperelastic energy keeping the active part of the deformation gradient fixed .    in the future , it will be very interesting to find some connections between the damage percentage ( the parameter @xmath0 ) and other physiological quantities , such as the mass of the muscular tissue or the neuronal activity . another important topic will be the application of some homogenization techniques in order to deduce an improved constitutive equation for the skeletal muscle starting from its microstructure .",
    "skeletal muscle tissue is characterized by densely packed muscle fibers , which are arranged in fascicles . filling the spaces between the fibers and fascicles",
    ", connective tissue surrounds the muscle and it is responsible of the elastic recoil of the muscle to elongation . besides a large amount of water , the fibers themselves contain titin , actin and myosin filaments .",
    "the latter two sliding elements form the actual contractile component of the muscle , which is called _",
    "sarcomere_. since the fibers locally follow a predominant unidirectional alignment , transverse isotropy with respect to that main direction can be assumed .",
    "we hence begin by modelling the skeletal muscle tissue as a transversely isotropic nonlinear hyperelastic material with principal direction @xmath1 , which follows the alignment of the muscle fibers .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the deformation gradient tensor , @xmath3 the right cauchy - green tensor and @xmath4 the so called _ structural tensor_. if @xmath5 denotes the reference configuration occupied by the muscle , we describe its passive behavior by choosing a hyperelastic strain energy function @xmath6 where the strain energy density is of the form @xmath7+k_p-1\\right\\ } , \\label{d : wpassiva}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 here @xmath9 is an elastic parameter and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are positive dimensionless material parameters .",
    "the generalized invariants @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given by a weighted combination of the isotropic and anisotropic components ; in particular , @xmath11 measures the ratio of isotropic tissue constituents and @xmath14 that of muscle fibers .",
    "moreover , the term @xmath15 represents the squared stretch in the direction of the muscle fiber and is thus associated with longitudinal fiber properties , while the term @xmath16 describes the change of the squared cross - sectional area of a surface element which is normal to the direction @xmath1 in the reference configuration and thus relates to the transverse behavior of the material @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ d : biaxial ] ) .",
    "one of the mathematical features of the energy density is that it is polyconvex and coercive @xcite , hence the equilibrium problem with mixed boundary conditions is well posed .",
    "we remark that @xmath17 is the identity tensor @xmath18 in the reference configuration , so that @xmath19 , _",
    "i.e. _ we have the energy- and stress - free state of the passive muscle tissue ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the high content of water is responsible of the nearly incompressible behavior which is experimentally reported for muscle fibers , so that we can assume @xmath20    as is customary in hyperelasticity , the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor , known as _ nominal stress tensor _ , can be directly computed by differentiating the strain energy function : @xmath21   & = & \\frac{\\mu}{2}{\\f}\\left\\{e^{\\alpha(i_p-1)}\\left[\\frac{w_0}{3}{\\i}+(1-w_0){\\m}\\right]-{\\c}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{w_0}{3}{\\i}+(1-w_0){\\m}\\right]{\\c}^{-1}\\right\\}-p{\\f}^{-t } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a lagrange multiplier associated with the hydrostatic pressure which results from the incompressibility constraint .",
    "the material parameters of the model can be obtained from real data .",
    "more precisely , concerning the elastic parameter @xmath9 , we use the value given in @xcite , while the other two parameters have been obtained by least squares optimization using the experimental data by hawkins and bey @xcite about the stretch response of a tetanized _ tibialis anterior _ of a rat ( see fig .

    "[ d : paragoneebi ] we can see the comparison between the nominal stress in the direction of the stretch of the two models when the muscle fibers are elongated in their direction .",
    "one of the main features of the skeletal muscle tissue is its ability of being voluntarily activated .",
    "skeletal muscles are activated through electrical impulses from motor nerves ; the activation triggers a chemical reaction between the actin and myosin filaments which produces a sliding of the molecular chains , causing a contraction of the muscle fibers .    during the last decades",
    ", many authors tried to mathematically model the process of activation , mainly with two different approaches ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the most famous approach followed in the literature is called _ active stress _ and it consists in adding an extra term to the stress , which accounts for the contribution given by the activation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is an _",
    "ad hoc _ method , usually not related to the sliding movement of the filaments in the sarcomeres , which is the main mechanism of contraction at the mesoscale .",
    "more recently , the _ active strain _ approach was proposed by taber and perucchio @xcite in order to describe the activation of the cardiac tissue , following previous theories of growth and morphogenesis , as well as several models of plasticity .",
    "the method for soft living tissues is explained in @xcite .",
    "differently from the active stress approach , this method does not change the form of the strain energy function ; rather , it assumes that only a part of the deformation gradient , obtained by a multiplicative decomposition , is responsible for the store of elastic energy .",
    "this method is related to the biological meaning of activation and can be reasonably adopted also in our case . to the best of our knowledge , the active strain approach has never been followed for the skeletal muscle tissue in literature .",
    "we begin by rewriting the deformation gradient as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the elastic part and @xmath28 describes the active contribution ( see fig .  [",
    "d : figactivestrainapproach ] ) .",
    "the active strain @xmath28 represents a change of the reference volume elements due to the contraction of the sarcomeres , so that it does not contribute to the elastic energy .",
    "a reference volume element , distorted by @xmath28 , needs a further deformation @xmath27 to match the actual volume element , which accommodates both the external forces and the active contraction .",
    "notice that neither @xmath28 nor @xmath27 need to be the gradients of some displacement , that is , it is not necessary that they fulfill the compatibility condition @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the volume elements are modified by the internal active forces without changing the elastic energy , hence the strain energy function of the activated material has to be computed using @xmath31 and taking into account @xmath32 . if @xmath33 for some displacement @xmath34 , then from fig .",
    "[ d : figactivestrainapproach ] by a change of variables it is easy to see that @xmath35 the right - hand side of the previous equation is well defined also when @xmath28 does not come from a global displacement , and it describes the strain energy of the active body .",
    "we then obtain the modified hyperelastic energy density @xmath36    we now have to model the active part @xmath28 . since the activation of the muscle consists in a contraction along the fibers , we choose @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a dimensionless parameter representing the relative contraction of activated fibers ( @xmath39 meaning no activation )",

    "the activation parameter @xmath47 , which was assumed constant in the previous section , in fact usually depends on the deformation gradient . in typical experiments on a tetanized skeletal muscle",
