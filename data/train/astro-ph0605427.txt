    "in recent years , multi - wavelength observations of afterglow emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have provided great advancement in our knowledge of grb progenitor , afterglow emission mechanism , and their environment .",
    "nonetheless , the physical mechanism that creates the prompt gamma - ray emission with extremely short variability is still not resolved , thus understanding grb prompt emission spectra remains crucial to revealing their true nature .",
    "grb spectral analysis attempts to empirically characterize the spectra , which are generally well described , in the energy range of @xmath0 10 kev to a few mev , by two power laws joined smoothly at certain energies @xcite .",
    "the spectral parameters ( the power - law indices and the peak energy in the power density spectrum ) are then used to infer the grb emission and particle acceleration mechanisms .    currently , the most favored grb emission mechanism is the simple emission scenario of optically - thin synchrotron radiation by shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "this simple theoretical model , however , has previously been challenged by the observations in the context of grb prompt emission @xcite . while the synchrotron shock model can account for many of the observed spectra , a considerable number of spectra exhibit behavior inconsistent with this theoretical model .",
    "meanwhile , it is also true that many observed spectra could be fitted with various photon models statistically as well as each other , due to the limited spectral resolution of available data and detector sensitivity .",
    "since the photon models usually used in grb spectral analysis are parameterized differently , the resulting spectral parameters are found to be highly dependent on photon model choices @xcite . additionally , to deduce the emission mechanism from observations , spectra with fine time resolution are necessary because of the short timescales involved in typical emission processes ( i.e. , the radiative cooling time , dynamical time , or acceleration time ) .",
    "this is also indicated by the extremely short variability observed in grb lightcurves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the detectors finest time resolution is still longer than the shortest physical timescales involved to produce grbs .",
    "the integration times of spectra certainly depend on the capabilities of the detector systems as well as the brightness of events and photon flux evolution .",
    "grb spectral analyses , therefore , have been performed on various timescales , yet a comprehensive study of the relations between time - averaged and time - resolved spectra , and the effects of various integration times on spectral properties has not been done .",
    "thus , in order for the spectral parameters to meaningfully constrain the physical mechanisms , a comprehensive spectral study with finest possible spectral and temporal resolution , using various photon models , should be carried out with a sufficiently large database .    among all the gamma - ray experiments that have detected grbs , the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ;",
    "* ) , aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    "( _ cgro _ ; * ? ? ? * ) , provided the largest grb database from a single experiment , consisting of observational data for 2704 grbs ( m.s .",
    "briggs in preparation ) . for many of the batse grbs ,",
    "high time and energy resolution data are available .",
    "batse also provided wider energy coverage than current grb missions such as _ hete-2 _ and _ swift_. the batse data , therefore , are the most suitable for detailed spectral studies of grb prompt emission , both in quantity and quality .",
    "the previous batse grb spectral catalog ( * ? ? ? * sp1 hereafter ) consisted of 5500 time - resolved spectra from 156 bright grbs that occurred before october 1998 . the sp1 burst sample was selected from a set of 1771 grbs ( from the batse 4b catalog @xcite and the `` current '' catalog available online ) , nearly 1000 bursts less than what is currently available in the complete database .",
    "the sample was also limited to the bursts that provided more than eight spectra and therefore , excluded relatively shorter and weaker bursts .",
    "in addition , a combination of the large area detector ( lad ) and spectroscopy detector ( sd ) data was used , no time - integrated spectral fit ( i.e. , spectrum with integration time of the burst duration ) results were presented , and only one photon model was fitted to each spectrum .",
    "finally , the mathematical differences in parameterization of each model were not taken into account to obtain corrected overall statistics of the analysis results .",
    "we present in this paper the high - energy resolution spectral analysis of 350 bright batse grbs with fine time resolution .",
    "the main objective of this work is to obtain consistent spectral properties of grb prompt emission with sufficiently good statistics .",
    "this is done by a systematic analysis of the large sample of grb spectra , using a set of photon models , all fitted to each spectrum .",
    "our spectral sample includes both time - resolved and time - integrated spectra for each burst : the time - resolved spectra within each burst has the best possible time resolution for the high - energy resolution data types used , and the time - integrated spectra are the sum of the resolved spectra within the bursts , covering entire duration of the bursts .",
    "we obtain well - constrained spectral properties by studying characteristics of each photon model , taking into account the parameterization differences , and statistically determining the best - fit model for each spectrum .",
    "the analysis performed here is much more comprehensive and consistent than that of sp1 in the sense that ( i ) only lad data are used , ( ii ) the burst sample selections are more objective , ( iii ) five different photon models are fitted to each spectrum , both time - integrated and time - resolved , and ( iv ) the best - fit parameters of each spectrum are statistically determined .",
    "the use of various models allows us to compare the behavior of different models as well as to obtain unbiased statistics for the spectral parameters .",
    "we also note that the batse data and the detector response matrices ( drms ) used here have been regenerated since the publication of sp1 , with a refined detector calibration database .",
    "this provided more precise lad energy edges , thus assuring the improved accuracy of the spectral analysis .",
    "since our sample only includes bright bursts , there may be some bias in our analysis results . as reported previously in literature",
    ", there is a tendency of bright bursts being spectrally harder than dimmer bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is likely that our sample of bright bursts belongs to the harder side of the overall batse grb sample , on average ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is particularly important to keep this in mind when studying global correlations with our spectral analysis results .",
    "our selection criteria also excludes many bright short bursts with duration much less than a second . as a result ,",
    "only @xmath0 5% of our sample are short bursts ( duration @xmath1 2 s ) while short bursts comprises @xmath0 19% of the entire batse grb sample .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "we first describe the burst sample and analysis interval selection methodology in  [ sec : selection ] .",
    "the details of the spectral analysis methods are then discussed in  [ sec : analysis ] , including descriptions of the photon models used .",
    "we also discuss our simulation results in  [ sec : simulation ] , which were performed to assist us in interpreting the analysis results correctly .",
    "finally , the analysis results are presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] and summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we note that there are two ways of identifying a batse burst ; by the grb name (  grb _ yymmdd _ \" ) and by the batse trigger number .",
    "we use both the names and trigger numbers to refer to individual grbs throughout this paper .",
    "during its nine - year lifetime that ended in june 2000 , batse triggered on a total of 8021 gamma - ray transient events , of which 2704 events were identified as grbs .",
    "the batse detectors were sensitive enough to detect relatively weak grbs down to a peak photon flux in 256 ms of @xmath0 0.3  s@xmath2  @xmath3 ( 50  300 kev ) and a total energy fluence in 25  2000  kev of @xmath4  ergs  @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , many dim bursts do not provide enough signal above background for high energy resolution spectral analysis , particularly for time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , we need to select and limit our analysis to grbs with sufficient signal . in addition , the available data types and data ranges vary for each burst . in this section ,",
    "we describe the methodology employed for the burst selection , the data type selection , and time and energy interval selections .",
    "the primary selection was made based on the peak photon flux and the total energy fluence in the batse 4b catalog @xcite , as well as the current batse grb catalogfor the post-4b bursts .",
    "the catalogs list a total of 2702  grbs , of which two were later identified as non - grbs ( trigger numbers 5458 and 7523 ) . additionally , there are four triggered events that were later identified as grbs ( trigger numbers 1505 , 2580 , 3452 , and 3934 ) , bringing the total number of batse grbs to 2704 .",
    "the number is consistent with the final batse 5b catalog ( m.s .",
    "briggs et  al . in preparation ) .",
    "our sample was selected from these 2704  bursts .",
    "the burst selection criteria are a peak photon flux in 256  ms ( 50  300 kev ) greater than 10  photons  s@xmath2  @xmath3 or a total energy fluence in the summed energy range ( @xmath0 20  2000 kev ) larger than @xmath5 ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "having the criteria in either the peak photon flux or total energy fluence allows inclusion of short bright bursts as well as long bursts with low peak flux .",
    "the peak photon flux criterion remains the same as sp1 , although it was misstated in sp1 as a 1024-ms integration time .",
    "the energy fluence criterion has been lowered from the value used in sp1 so as to include more bursts , while still securing sufficiently good statistics .",
    "a total of 298 grbs satisfied these criteria .",
    "in addition , 573 grbs out of 2704 do not have flux / fluence values published in any batse grb catalog , mainly due to gaps in the four - channel discriminator data that were used to obtain the flux / fluence values .",
    "nonetheless , for many of these bursts , finer energy - resolution data are still available for spectral analysis , and some are bright enough to be included in this work .",
    "therefore , we estimated the photon flux and the energy fluence values for the bursts with no published flux / fluence values , using available data . to estimate the peak photon flux and energy fluence for such bursts",
    ", we used 16-channel mer data ( see  [ sec : data ] below for the description of the data type ) binned to a 256-ms integration time and fitted with a smoothly - broken power - law model ( described later in  [ sec : sbpl_model ] ) .",
    "the peak photon flux values ( in 256 ms , @xmath0 50  300 kev ) and the total energy fluence values ( in @xmath0 30  1900 kev ) were calculated from the fitted spectra . we note that using other photon models barely changed the outcome .",
    "there were some cases where mer data were not available but either herb or cont data existed .",
    "most of these cases , however , turned out to be noticeably very weak , or else all of the available data were not complete , and therefore did not qualify for inclusion . in this way , 55 grbs yielded peak photon flux or total energy fluence values well above our threshold criteria , and were therefore included in this work .",
    "out of these selected bright bursts , we found two cases ( trigger numbers 3366 and 7835 ) in which the published flux / fluence values were incorrect and the actual flux / fluence values were much lower than the criteria used here . consequently , these two bursts were excluded .",
    "we also found one case ( trigger number 5614 , peak photon flux @xmath6 182 photons s@xmath2 @xmath3 ) in which the burst was so bright that the indication of possible pulse pile - up was seen in the energy spectra of all available detectors and the data were not usable .",
    "thus , this burst was also excluded from this work .",
    "the resulting total number of grbs included in this spectral analysis was 350 .",
    "the grbs are listed in table [ tab : grblist ] , along with the data types , time and energy intervals , and numbers of time - resolved spectra contained .",
    "batse was specifically designed to detect grbs and to study their temporal and spectral characteristics in great resolution . in order to increase the grb detection probability , batse consisted of eight modules that were located at the corners of the _ cgro _ spacecraft , so as to cover the entire 4@xmath7 steradian of sky .",
    "each module comprised two types of detectors ; lad and sd .",
    "they were both nai(tl ) scintillation detectors of different dimensions designed to achieve different scientific goals .",
    "the lads were 50.8 cm in diameter and 1.27 cm in thickness , and provided burst triggering and burst localizations with high sensitivity .",
    "they were gain - stabilized to cover the energy range of @xmath0 30 kev  2 mev .",
    "the sds were 12.7 cm in diameter and 7.62 cm in thickness , and provided a higher energy resolution in @xmath0 10 kev  10 mev , depending on the gain of each detector at the time of a burst trigger .    in this spectral analysis ,",
    "only the lad data are used , mainly to take advantage of its larger effective area @xcite .",
    "another reason that only the lad data are used is due to a problem recently identified in the sd drms at energies above @xmath0 3 mev @xcite .",
    "these problems could give rise to uncertainties in the sd drms and make sd data unreliable for spectral analysis at high energies .",
    "moreover , limiting to one type of detector eliminates systematic uncertainties arising from different detector characteristics , and thus keeps the analysis more uniform . for each burst",
    ", the data from the lad with the highest counts are used .",
    "the lads provided various types of data products to be used for various purposes .",
    "the data were collected in either burst mode or non - burst mode .",
    "the burst mode data accumulation started when a burst was triggered , whereas the non - burst mode data were usually continuous , except for possible telemetry gaps .",
    "the burst mode data generally provided higher resolution either in energy or in time than the non - burst mode data .",
    "the three lad data types used in this work , in order of priority , are high energy resolution burst data ( herb ) , medium energy resolution data ( mer ) , and continuous data ( cont ) .",
    "the characteristics of each data type are listed in table [ tab : datatypes ] ( see sp1 for more complete list of batse burst data types ) .",
    "the herb and mer data are burst - mode data , for which the acquisition began at the time of a burst trigger , whereas cont was continuous , non - burst mode data .",
    "the accumulation time of the herb data is rate dependent , with minimum time - to - spill of 128 ms with a 64-ms increment .",
    "herb provides the highest energy resolution consisting of @xmath8 usable energy channels in energy range of @xmath0 30  2000 kev with modest sub - second time resolution , and thus is used as the primary data type . for each burst , the herb data for the brightest lad provides the finest time resolution , and was always selected for the analysis . the coarser - time resolution ( @xmath9 s )",
    "high energy resolution data ( her ) are used as background data for the herb , covering several thousand seconds before the trigger and after the herb accumulation is finished . however , especially for long , bright bursts , the herb data can often be incomplete since herb had a fixed memory space that could fill up before the burst was over . in this work ,",
    "we consider the herb data incomplete when the data do not cover the burst duration ( @xmath10 ) or when the data do not include the main peak episodes ( this could occur if a burst data accumulation was triggered by weak precursor ) .",
    "in such cases , or if herb was not available , 16-energy - channel mer data were used instead .",
    "although mer provides medium energy resolution , it has much finer time resolution ( 16 and 64 ms ) than herb , making it possible to re - create the time resolution of the missing herb . in the mer data ,",
    "the cont data are used as background ; therefore , the spectra accumulated before the trigger time and after 163.8 seconds ( the mer accumulation time ) are identical to those of cont , with 2.048-s integration times .",
    "the downside of using mer is that the data are summed over multiple sets of detectors ( usually two to four ) , and therefore , systematic errors tend to dominate over statistic errors , especially for bright bursts .",
    "systematic errors can not be modeled into the analysis and can contribute to large @xmath11 especially at lower energies due to the high counts .",
    "this systematic effects can also be visible in the single - detector data ( herb and cont ) but are much more often found in the mer data of bright bursts .",
    "examples of herb and mer spectra of the same bright burst ( grb 910503 , trigger number 143 ) that show such systematic deviations are seen in figure [ fig : system ] .",
    "possible contributions to the systematics include the uncertainties from the lad calibration @xcite and the drm @xcite .",
    "lastly , in the cases where neither herb nor mer were available for the analysis , 16-energy - channel cont data with 2.048-s time resolution from the brightest lad were used . despite the lack of sub - second time resolution",
    ", the advantage of cont is that the data are from a single detector and continuous .",
    "thus , significant precursor activities may be included in the analysis using the cont data .",
    "this was not possible for herb , because the data accumulations always started at triggers , and the background data ( her ) did not provide a sufficient time resolution for pre - trigger data .",
    "for each of 350 bursts , the data type used is listed in column 4 of table [ tab : grblist ] , and the total number of bursts using each data type is 270 ( herb ) , 52 ( mer ) , and 28 ( cont ) .",
    "we binned the data in time until each spectrum has a large enough signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the entire lad energy band to ensure acceptable statistics for the time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "the s / n is calculated based upon the background model of each burst .",
    "the background model is determined by fitting ( each energy channel separately ) a low - order ( @xmath12 4 ) polynomial function to spectra that cover time intervals before and after each burst , for at least a few hundred seconds . in cases where the background data are not available for a sufficiently long period ,",
    "the longest available time intervals were used , and the background model was checked against those determined using other lad data available for the same burst .",
    "the burst start time is usually the trigger time . in the cases where cont or mer were used ,",
    "bright pre - trigger activity ( containing significant amount of emission ) was also included in the analysis , and thus the start time can be negative relative to the trigger time .    in sp1 ,",
    "a minimum s / n of 45 was used for the time binning of spectra regardless of the data types used .",
    "the s / n level was chosen so that each spectral resolution element ( non - overlapping full - width at half - maximum resolution elements , of which there are about 16  20 in the lad energy range ) has approximately 10@xmath13 of the signal on average , assuming a flat spectrum .",
    "the noise ( or @xmath13 ) defined here is the poisson error of the observed total counts , including the background counts .",
    "binning by a constant s / n , however , usually yields on average a few times larger number of time - resolved spectra when mer data are used , than the herb and cont cases .",
    "this is because the mer data are summed over two to four detectors , while herb and cont are single - detector data , and thus the mer data have higher",
    "s / n to begin with , on top of having a finer time resolution . as a result , bursts with mer data were overrepresented in the time - resolved spectral sample of sp1 due to the choice of data type , which in turn slightly biased the spectral parameter and model statistics presented there .",
    "the mer bursts do provide more time - resolved spectra on average since we use the mer data for long , bright grbs ; however , this is caused by the nature of the bursts and should not be caused by the choice of data type . to minimize the over - representation caused by the data type selection , we investigated which s / n value for mer would yield comparable numbers of time - resolved spectra compared with herb binned by s / n @xmath14 , for the same bursts . since the mer data are mainly used for bright , long bursts , and",
    "also the oversampling problems are more likely to occur when the photon flux is high , we selected 15 bursts with high peak photon flux ( @xmath15 photons s@xmath2 @xmath3 in 128 ms , @xmath0 30  2000 kev , determined using herb data ) , for which both mer and herb data were available .",
    "we re - binned the herb data with minimum s / n of 45 , and reproduced the same number of spectra for the same time intervals with mer data , by increasing the minimum s / n in steps .",
    "we found that a minimum s / n of 45  _ per  detector _ could roughly accomplish this , regardless of the brightness , as shown in figure [ fig : snr ] .",
    "therefore , the minimum s / n used for the time binning is 45 @xmath16 number of detectors , with the exception of 10 mer bursts .",
    "these 10 bursts were mostly with three or four detectors and the minimum s / n was found to be too high , for various reasons , when compared with the available portion of single - detector data ( i.e. , herb or cont ) for the same burst .",
    "consequently , for these bursts , the minimum s / n was reduced by steps of 45 until the binning comparable to that of herb was achieved .    after time - binning by the minimum s / n , the last time interval , with a s /",
    "n less than the minimum value , was dropped .",
    "although the last time bin may constitute a significant tail portion of the burst , we found that this exclusion of the last time bin does not greatly affect the time - integrated spectral fits .",
    "this is true even when the resulting time interval that is fitted is much shorter than the @xmath10 of the burst ( e.g. , a burst with a very long tail ) . unlike for sp1 where bursts with less than eight spectra were dropped ,",
    "no bursts that satisfy the burst selection criteria described above are excluded , regardless of the resulting number of spectra after binning in each burst .",
    "this allowed the inclusion of 17 short grbs ( @xmath17 s ) as well as several dimmer bursts in this work .",
    "note that a set of time - resolved spectra comprises the time - integrated spectrum of each burst ; therefore , the time interval of the integrated spectrum is the sum of the intervals of all the resolved spectra within the burst .",
    "most integrated spectra cover the @xmath10 duration .",
    "columns 6 and 7 of table [ tab : grblist ] list the time intervals used for each burst",
    ". there are 11 bursts ( batse trigger numbers 298 , 444 , 1525 , 2514 , 2679 , 3087 , 3736 , 6240 , 6293 , 7457 , 7610 ) that provided only one spectrum as a result of the time binning .",
    "in addition , there are six weak bursts ( 2112 , 3044 , 3410 , 3412 , 3917 , and 6668 ) for which the detection of the entire event was @xmath18 : they provided only one spectrum of 28@xmath13 , 15@xmath13 , 26@xmath13 , 28@xmath13 , 40@xmath13 , and 28@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "these six spectra were still included in the sample for completeness .",
    "four of these six bursts are short grbs . for these bursts that provided only one spectrum ,",
    "the same spectra are considered as both the time - integrated and time - resolved spectra , and they are indicated by the prefix  w \" in column 1 of table [ tab : grblist ] .",
    "it must also be noted that there are eight bursts ( indicated by the prefix  c \" in column 1 of table [ tab : grblist ] ) whose time - integrated spectra were used for calibration of the eight lads @xcite . since the fits to a two - component empirical grb model (  [ sec : models ] , equation [ band_model ] )",
    "was used for the calibration , the time - integrated spectra of these calibration bursts are , by default , expected to give small @xmath11 values when fitted with a two - component model ( equations [ band_model ] & [ sbpl_model ] ) , although the time intervals used for the calibration and for this work are different .",
    "all lads were gain - stabilized ; therefore , the usable energy range for spectral analyses is @xmath0 30 kev  2 mev for all bursts .",
    "the lowest seven channels of herb and two channels of mer and cont are usually below the electronic lower - energy cutoff and were excluded .",
    "likewise , the highest few channels of herb and normally the very highest channel of mer and cont are unbounded energy overflow channels and also not usable . the actual energy range used in the analysis for each burst",
    "is shown in columns 8 and 9 of table [ tab : grblist ] .",
    "our sample consisted of 350 grbs , providing 350 time - integrated spectra and 8459 time - resolved spectra .",
    "we analyzed both time - integrated and time - resolved spectra , each fitted by a set of photon models that are commonly used to fit grb spectra .",
    "each of the photon models used consists of a different number of free parameters and thus , provides different degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) for each fit .",
    "this allows statistical comparisons among the model fits .",
    "the fitting procedures and the photon models are discussed in this section .      for the spectral analysis presented",
    "herein , we used the spectral analysis software rmfit , which was specifically developed for burst data analysis by the batse team @xcite .",
    "it incorporates a fitting algorithm mfit that employs the forward - folding method @xcite , and the goodness of fit is determined by @xmath11 minimization .",
    "one advantage of mfit is that it utilizes model variances instead of data variances , which enables more accurate fitting even for data @xcite .",
    "we analyzed both time - integrated and time - resolved spectra for each burst , using a set of photon models described below .",
    "we have selected five spectral models of interest to fit the batse grb spectra , three of which ( band , comp , and sbpl ) were also employed in sp1 . having a variety of models in fitting each spectrum eliminates the need for manipulating one model , such as the  constrained \" band function introduced by @xcite , which requires some presumptions of the form for the original photon spectrum .",
    "grb spectra are usually well - represented by a broken power law in the batse energy band . however , it is possible that the break energy lies outside the energy range , or that the spectrum is very soft or dim and the high - energy component is not detected .",
    "therefore , we use a single power - law and a power - law with exponential cutoff model that may accommodate such spectra , in addition to the more commonly - fit broken power - law models .",
    "we review each model used in the analysis below .",
    "all models are functions of energy @xmath19 , measured in kev .",
    "the first model is a single power law with two free parameters , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the amplitude in photons  s@xmath2  @xmath3  kev@xmath2 , @xmath22 is a spectral index , and the pivot energy @xmath23 was kept constant at 100 kev for this work .",
    "the use of this model was motivated by the fact that the break energy of a broken power law spectrum could lie well outside the lad passband .",
    "there may also be a case where the signal is weak and the break energy can not be adequately determined . in such cases ,",
    "the two - parameter single power law should be able to fit the spectra better than the other models with more parameters .",
    "the next model is the empirical model most widely used to fit grb spectra @xcite : @xmath24^{\\alpha-\\beta }              \\exp{(\\beta-\\alpha ) }               \\left(\\frac{\\textstyle e}{\\textstyle 100}\\right)^{\\beta } &     \\rm{if~~ } e \\geq e_{\\rm c},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 the model consists of four parameters : the amplitude @xmath21 in photons  s@xmath2  @xmath3  kev@xmath2 , a low - energy spectral index @xmath26 , a high - energy spectral index @xmath27 , and a @xmath28 peak energy @xmath29 in kev , which is related to the @xmath30-folding energy , @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath28 spectrum represents the total energy flux per energy band ( i.e. , power density spectrum , @xmath32 ) .",
    "we stress that the @xmath26 index characterizes an asymptotic power - law ( i.e. , the tangential slope determined at @xmath33 in a logarithmic scale ) .",
    "this may not characterize the actual logarithmic tangential slope determined within the data energy range , when the @xmath30-folding energy @xmath31 approaches the lower energy bound .",
    "it has now become common practice to use this empirical model to fit both time - integrated and -resolved grb spectra .",
    "very frequently , however , we find some time - resolved spectra can not be adequately fitted with this model . by fitting this model to both time - integrated and time - resolved spectra , we test the validity of the scope of this model .",
    "the beta model is a variation of the band , with a fixed high - energy index @xmath27 , and is only used to fit the time - resolved spectral fits .",
    "the fixed value of @xmath27 is determined from the time - integrated spectral fit using the regular band model .",
    "since @xmath27 is fixed in the fit , this is essentially a 3-parameter model with @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and @xmath29 .",
    "our motivation for using this model is to test the hypothesis that the energy distribution of the shock - accelerated electron remains constant throughout a burst .",
    "the post - shock electron distribution should be thermal at low energies and non - thermal ( power law ) at high energies @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum emitted by electrons in a power - law distribution , @xmath34 , is a power - law of index @xmath35 @xcite , which should correspond to the high - energy index , @xmath27 .",
    "it has been found that for fermi - type acceleration , the accelerated particles have a power - law distribution with index @xmath36 that is constant in time @xcite .",
    "therefore , if @xmath37 remains constant throughout a burst , @xmath27 should also remain constant in the context of the synchrotron shock model .",
    "in fact , it has been found with a smaller sample that the majority of grbs do not exhibit strong evolution in @xmath27 @xcite , so we examine this here with a larger sample .      the next model considered is a low - energy power law with an exponential high - energy cutoff .",
    "it is equivalent to the band model without a high energy power law , namely @xmath38 , and has the form @xmath39 like the pwrl case , @xmath23 was always fixed at 100 kev in this work ; therefore , the model consists of three parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and @xmath29 .",
    "there are many batse grb spectra that lack high - energy photons @xcite , and these no - high - energy spectra are usually fitted well with this model .",
    "another case where this model would be a good fit is when the @xmath30-folding energy ( @xmath40 ) approaches @xmath0 1 mev , and the high - energy index of the band model can not be determined by the data .",
    "the model is so named because in the special case of @xmath41 , it represents the comptonized spectrum from a thermal medium ; however , @xmath26 is kept as a free parameter here .",
    "note that when @xmath42 , the exponential term in the model diverges ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , and the resulting spectrum has a concave - up shape .",
    "the last model we have selected is a broken power law with flexible curvature at the break energy , and thus the model can accommodate spectra with very sharp breaks , as well as ones with very smooth curvature .",
    "this sbpl model is expressed by @xmath44 where @xmath45 the parameters are the amplitude @xmath21 in photons  s@xmath2  @xmath3  kev@xmath2 , a lower power - law index @xmath46 , a break energy @xmath47 in kev , a break scale @xmath48 , in decades of energy , and an upper power - law index @xmath49 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath21 represents the photon flux at @xmath23 .",
    "the model introduces a break scale @xmath48 as the fifth parameter ; this is thus a five - parameter model . like the pwrl and comp models above ,",
    "the pivot energy @xmath23 is always fixed at 100 kev here .",
    "the amplitude @xmath21 is determined at this @xmath23 , and it represents a convenient overall energy scale .",
    "this model was originally created to be implemented into mfit , and the full derivation is found in appendix [ ap : sbpl_model ] . the basic idea in deriving",
    "this model was to have the derivative of the photon flux ( in logarithmic scale ) to be a continuous function of the hyperbolic tangent ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main difference between this model and the band model is that the break scale is not coupled to the power laws , and it approaches the asymptotic low - energy power law much quicker than the band model case .",
    "therefore , the low - energy spectral index @xmath46 could characterize values that are closer to the @xmath50 power law indices indicated by the actual data points , than is possible with @xmath26 of the band model .",
    "note also that as @xmath51 , the model reduces to a sharply - broken power law .",
    "however , introducing a fifth parameter can be a problem in fitting the lad spectra .",
    "although the herb data provides 126 energy channels , the energy range encompasses only about 20 energy resolution elements , as mentioned earlier .",
    "fitting a four - parameter model to the herb data can already cause the covariance matrix between parameters [ @xmath52 to be ill - determined , resulting in unconstrained parameters .",
    "this is indicated by a condition number for [ @xmath52@xmath2 that is of the order of the reciprocal of the machine precision , meaning that the matrix is nearly singular ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently ,",
    "having an additional free parameter usually results in highly cross - correlated , unconstrained parameter determinations , and is not favored .",
    "for this reason , in sp1 , @xmath48 was fixed for each time - resolved spectral fit to the value determined by the time - integrated fit for the corresponding burst ; however , there is no reason to presume that @xmath48 remains constant throughout a burst , and also it could be problematic if the initial time - integrated break scale is unconstrained . on the other hand , we may not be able to constrain @xmath48 any better than a particular value , due to the finite energy resolution of the lads , even if the five - parameter model fit can be done . to resolve this issue",
    ", we have simulated sbpl spectra with various parameters and fitted these spectra with the sbpl model for various values of @xmath48 .",
    "the simulation results are discussed in  [ sec : sbpl_sim ] .",
    "we emphasize that the break energy @xmath47 of the sbpl model should not be confused with @xmath29 of the band and comp models .",
    "the break energy is simply the energy at which the spectrum changes from the low - energy to high - energy power law , whereas @xmath29 is the energy at which the @xmath28 spectrum peaks .",
    "the break energy @xmath47 is also different from the characteristic energy @xmath53 in the band model ( equation [ band_model ] ) , which is the energy where the low - energy power law with exponential cutoff ends and the pure high - energy power law starts .",
    "however , the @xmath28 peak energy of the sbpl spectra , as well as the spectral break energy of band , can be easily derived ( see the appendices [ ap : sbpl_ep ] and [ ap : band_eb ] ) for comparison among the various models , which we have done here for the first time . +",
    "in order to interpret the quantitative analysis results correctly , we first need to understand the general characteristics and behavior of each photon model when applied to the batse lad grb spectra . therefore , we have generated a large set of simulated burst spectra with various spectral shapes and signal strengths , and subjected them to our analysis regime . to create a set of simulated count spectra , a source photon model with specific parameters and a background count model of an actual ( typical ) lad burst",
    "are folded through the corresponding lad drm , and poisson noise is added .",
    "it should be noted that the simulated spectra do not include any sources of systematic effects that are present in the real spectra .",
    "there are two main objectives in simulating data for this study .",
    "one is to investigate the behavior of the band and comp models in the limit of low s / n and the other is to explore the break scale determination of sbpl .",
    "the broken - power law nature of the grb spectra indicates that there typically are considerably lower photon fluxes at higher energies .",
    "because of this , there is a good chance that the lads are not sensitive enough to detect the non - thermal high - energy power law component of spectra in fainter bursts . in such cases ,",
    "even if the original source spectra have high - energy components , our data may not be able to identify this component and therefore , the no - high - energy comp model may statistically fit as well as the band model . as an example",
    ", we show in figure [ fig : band_comp ] a comparison between the band and the comp photon spectra with the same @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and @xmath29 values .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the simulated four - parameter band spectra with low s / n could be adequately fitted with the three - parameter comp model , although there were some shifts in the comp - fit parameters . in order to validate this for our dataset and using our analysis tool ( rmfit ,  [ sec : fit ] ) , we have further explored these two models by creating sets of simulated burst spectra , based on the actual fit parameters of some of the observed grb spectra that clearly have high - energy components .    to start with",
    ", we selected a sample of six bright grb spectra ( three each with herb and cont ) to which the band model fits substantially better than the comp model , with well - constrained parameters , resulting in large @xmath11 improvements ( @xmath54 ) for the additional 1 dof .",
    "this assures that the observed spectra have a high - energy power law component that is statistically significant .",
    "based on the spectral parameters provided with the band fits to the sample spectra ( i.e. , spectra with high - energy component ) , sets of 100 simulated spectra with various s / n were created . for the s / n variation",
    ", we used the actual fitted amplitude value and the values decreased by a step of a factor of 10 until the s / n was a few . as a result , a total of 19 sets provided @xmath55 in the entire lad energy range , based on the typical lad background count model that was taken as input for the simulation .",
    "the sets of simulated spectra were then fitted with the band and the comp models .",
    "some example results are presented in table [ tab : comp_band_res ] ( upper two tables ) , where @xmath56 indicates a median value of the parameter @xmath57 and the standard deviation is @xmath58 .",
    "the fit results indicated that s / n @xmath59 is needed for the band fits to be better than the comp fits , at @xmath60 99.9% confidence level ( @xmath61 for @xmath62 ) .",
    "for spectra with s / n @xmath0 40 , the confidence level of improvements in band over comp were @xmath1 70% . given that the minimum s / n of our time - resolved spectra in this work was set to 45 , for many dimmer spectra we should only be able to determine a better fit between the band and comp by only about 1@xmath13 ( 68.3% ) , although this may depend on the spectral parameters in each fit .    in accord with the @xcite results , the comp model resulted in higher @xmath29 values and steeper values of @xmath26 , due to compensating for the lack of high - energy spectral component in the model .",
    "consequently , the difference in the comp @xmath29 and the actual @xmath29 value tends to be correlated with @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , a strong anti - correlation was always found between @xmath29 and @xmath26 in both band and comp fits , regardless of s / n or values of other parameters . as a result",
    ", the amplitude @xmath21 is also highly anti - correlated to @xmath29 because the parameter @xmath21 of band and comp is the photon flux at 100 kev of the low - energy power - law @xmath63 the exponential cutoff .",
    "this is different from @xmath21 of the sbpl model .",
    "we also fitted the five - parameter sbpl model to the same sets of simulated band spectra , to investigate the possible parameterization differences in the indices .",
    "we found that the sbpl @xmath46 tends to be smaller than @xmath26 while @xmath49 seems to be consistent with @xmath27 , as we expected .",
    "similarly , we have also simulated sets of comp spectra with low and high @xmath29 values ( 300 and 760 kev , respectively ) with different s / n ( @xmath64 ) , and fitted them with the band model .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : comp_band_res ] ( lower two tables ) . in the high @xmath29 case",
    ", we found that the band fits did not converge about a third of the time , regardless of the s / n .",
    "the fitting failure is caused by a very poorly - constrained parameter ( @xmath27 in this case ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the low @xmath29 case , the number of failed fits was significantly smaller for the spectra with lower s / n .",
    "in both cases , the @xmath65 and @xmath66 values fitted by the band model were consistent with the simulated comp parameters , while @xmath67 only gave upper limits in a range of @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "the simulation results suggest that the band model fails to converge when a spectrum has sufficient high - energy photon flux but lacks the high - energy power - law component with finite spectral index .",
    "the spectrum in such a case essentially is the comp model , which is the band model with @xmath38 ( see  [ sec : comp ] ) . as an example , figure [ fig : comp2 ] shows two comp models that produced simulated spectra with s / n @xmath0 80 but with different @xmath29 values . as mentioned above , the band model fails to fit the high-@xmath29 spectrum much more frequently than the low-@xmath29 one . from figure",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] , it is evident that the high-@xmath29 spectrum has much larger photon flux at about 1 mev although the overall signal strengths are similar .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that the spectra that the band model fails to fit lack a high - energy power law component , yet this does not mean that these are the no - high - energy ( nhe ) spectra identified by @xcite , which show no counts above 300 kev .",
    "another topic that needs to be addressed is the break scale ( @xmath48 ) of the sbpl model , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : sbpl_model ] .",
    "the purpose of this simulation is to test the feasibility of performing the 5-parameter sbpl model fits with @xmath48 as a free parameter , as well as to examine the capability of the determination of @xmath48 by alternatively using a set of 4-parameter sbpl models with fixed @xmath48 .",
    "first , we created sets of 100 simulated sbpl spectra with @xmath48 values 0.01 and between 0.1 and 1.0 with an increment of 0.1 ( 11 total , in decades of energy ) , while keeping the other parameters fixed at typical fit values of @xmath47 = 300 kev , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ fig : sbpl_bsc ] shows the 11 simulated spectra in @xmath28 , with @xmath21 = 0.05 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath72 ( in decades of energy ) is reasonable , considering that the lad spectra span less than two decades of energy .",
    "the spectrum with @xmath73 represents a sharply - broken power law . to provide variations in the signal strength ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath21 was set to a typical value of 0.05 in one group , and was 0.01 in the other group , corresponding to the median s / n of @xmath74 and @xmath75 per spectrum , respectively .",
    "each of the simulated spectra was then fitted with the full 5-parameter sbpl model allowing @xmath48 to vary , with a set of 4-parameter sbpl models , each with @xmath48 fixed to the 11 values mentioned above , as well as with the band and the comp models for comparison .      in figure",
    "[ fig : sbpl5par ] , we show the @xmath48 values found by the 5-parameter sbpl model fits , with @xmath48 as a free parameter . for the high s / n case ,",
    "the correct @xmath48 values were found up to @xmath76 , with relatively small dispersions .",
    "for the low s / n case , only the very sharp break ( @xmath73 ) was constrained by the 5-parameter fits . as for the other parameters associated with the fits",
    ", we found that even for the bright cases , the 5-parameter fits resulted in relatively large uncertainties in all parameters , which worsened as @xmath48 became larger .",
    "this was also indicated by the large cross - correlation coefficients among all parameters , resulting from the fits .",
    "this confirms that fitting five free parameters at once does not determine the parameter with a good confidence , regardless of the s /",
    "n of spectrum , and therefore , the full 5-parameter fit is not favored .",
    "it is , however , worth noting that despite the large errors , @xmath48 found by the 5-parameter fits may still provide a rough estimate of the break scale even for faint spectra , as a last resort .",
    "alternatively , we could employ the grid - search method @xcite using a subset of 4-parameter sbpl fits with various fixed values of @xmath48 to determine the real @xmath48 .",
    "having such a set of 4-parameter model fits to each spectrum enables us to construct a one - dimensional @xmath11 map for @xmath48 , showing @xmath11 as a function of @xmath48 . from the @xmath11 map , we can determine the most likely value of @xmath48 ( where the @xmath11 is minimum ) as well as the confidence interval , while having the other parameters still constrained .    the @xmath77 map obtained from a 4-parameter model fitting of the bright ( s / n @xmath0 100 ) simulated spectra",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : sbpl_c2map ] .",
    "we find from the @xmath11 map that for @xmath78 the set of 4-parameter fits yields a minimum for @xmath11 at the correct @xmath48 values with 1@xmath13 uncertainties less than @xmath79 .",
    "however , for @xmath80 , the @xmath48 value could not be sufficiently constrained , especially at the upper ends , and the band model starts to give satisfactory fits that are statistically comparable to the sbpl model fits .",
    "this suggests that in the case of @xmath80 we can only determine the lower limit of @xmath81 with confidence .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath82 , the uncertainties associated with other spectral parameters become large although they are still in agreement within the uncertainties with the simulated values . as for the faint spectra ( s / n @xmath0 30 )",
    ", we found that the total change in @xmath11 for the entire set of @xmath48 values was only about 4 , which is within the @xmath83 confidence interval for @xmath62 ; therefore , the correct value of @xmath48 can not be determined even with the use of 4-parameter fits , due to the low s / n . in such cases , however , we also found that the @xmath48 determined from the 5-parameter sbpl fit can be used as an estimate . in other words ,",
    "the fit using a 4-parameter model with @xmath48 closest to the @xmath48 found from the 5-parameter fit could yield parameters that are adequately constrained and still consistent with the actual simulated parameters .",
    "the simulation was done both with 128-energy channel data and 16-energy channel data , in order to investigate the possible effects that might arise from the energy resolution issues .",
    "we found no differences between the 128-channel data and the 16-channel data in determining the break scales .",
    "based on these simulation results , we concluded that the 4-parameter sbpl models with @xmath84 do not contribute much additionally to our analysis ; therefore , we decided to use a set of 4-parameter sbpl models with @xmath85 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 , as well as 5-parameter sbpl model with @xmath48 varied , and @xmath48 fixed to the time - integrated fit value ( for comparison with sp1 ) . with regard to cross - correlations among the spectral parameters , @xmath47 and @xmath49",
    "are found to be always strongly anti - correlated in both 4-parameter and 5-parameter fits .",
    "moreover , the 4-parameter fits where @xmath48 is fixed tend to produce higher anti - correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath46 than the 5-parameter cases , which is expected for the fixed break scale cases .",
    "not surprisingly , in the 5-parameter fits , the @xmath46 ( @xmath49 ) is more strongly correlated ( anti - correlated ) with @xmath48 , as @xmath48 becomes larger .",
    "there was no explicit difference found in these cross - correlations according to s / n , although in the faint case , the parameters were more difficult to be constrained .",
    "the simulated sbpl spectra were also fitted with the band and comp models .",
    "the results of the band and comp fits to the bright simulated sbpl spectra ( i.e. , s / n @xmath0 100 ) are summarized in table [ tab : sbpl_band_res ] .",
    "as seen in the table ( also in figure [ fig : sbpl_c2map ] ) , the band model is not able to adequately fit the sbpl spectra with relatively sharp break scale ( @xmath86 ) because of its rather inflexible , smooth curvature .",

    "generally , for sharply broken spectra with small @xmath48 , the @xmath29 and @xmath26 of band ( also comp ) are larger than the sbpl  @xmath29 \" and @xmath87 , while the band @xmath27 is smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "the opposite is true for smooth break spectra with large @xmath48 .",
    "the tendencies are clearly seen in the example @xmath28 spectra in figure [ fig : sbpl_band ] , in which the band and comp fits to the simulated sbpl spectra with @xmath73 and 0.5 are shown .",
    "the band model seems to fit the sbpl spectra with @xmath89 the best , at least for these given values of @xmath47 and @xmath90 .",
    "the band fit to this spectrum , in fact , resulted in @xmath29 consistent with the sbpl  @xmath29 \" and @xmath26 larger than @xmath87 , which agrees with what was found from the sbpl fits to the simulated band spectra in an earlier section (  [ sec : band_sim ] ) .",
    "we also observe in table [ tab : sbpl_band_res ] that the band fits yielded much smaller @xmath29 range ( @xmath91  kev ) than the simulated  @xmath29 \" ( @xmath92  kev ) .",
    "although the comp fits were significantly worse , the comp @xmath29 was always higher and @xmath26 was always softer than the band case , consistent with what we found in  [ sec : band_sim ] .    in terms of @xmath11 statistics , for the bright spectra with s",
    "/ n @xmath0 100 , we find that the sbpl model can fit substantially better than the band model ( at confidence level @xmath93 99.9% ) to the simulated sbpl spectra with @xmath94 ; however , for the higher values of @xmath48 , band begins to fit statistically as well as sbpl fits .",
    "also in the bright spectrum case , the comp model gave worse fits for all values of @xmath48 , due to the lack of a high - energy component , and thus the sbpl fits were always better for this given set of the simulated spectral parameters . in the case of dim spectra with s /",
    "n @xmath0 30 , on the other hand , the sbpl fitted better than the band or the comp model for @xmath73 and @xmath95 , but only at confidence level of @xmath0 90% . also for the dim spectra with @xmath96 , we found that the band and the comp fits are statistically as good as the sbpl fit .",
    "we fitted the five photon models ( pwrl , band , beta , comp , sbpl ; see  [ sec : models ] ) as well as sbpl with fixed break scales ( @xmath85 0.01 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , & time - integrated value ) to each of the 350 time - integrated spectra and 8459 time - resolved spectra .",

    "the results of the comprehensive spectral analysis performed herein constitute the richest resource of grb prompt emission spectral properties .",
    "therefore , careful examination of these results enables us to better constrain physical mechanisms for grb prompt emission process .",
    "these results also allows us to explore systematics that are internal to the spectral models employed .",
    "the overall performance of each model in fitting all spectra is summarized in table [ tab : goodfit ] , in which the percentages of acceptable fits yielded by each model are shown .",

    "therefore , we used the dof for 5-parameter fits to determine goodness of fits , since we are indeed allowing the break scale ( the fifth parameter ) to vary . from table",
    "[ tab : goodfit ] , it is clear that many spectra are adequately fitted with various photon models .",
    "as determined solely by the @xmath11 of the fits , the sbpl model seems to be able to fit the data better than the other models , as seen in the table [ tab : goodfit ] , although the values are only slightly better than those obtained by the band model .",
    "the time - resolved spectra provide better @xmath11 values , partially due to the lower s / n compared with the time - integrated spectra .",
    "this is especially evident in the results for the comp cases , possibly indicating the existence of nhe spectra within high - energy bursts @xcite .",
    "as expected , the pwrl model resulted in poor fits for most of the spectra . in the following sections , we look at the results of our spectral analysis in terms of the parameter distributions , the model statistics , the comparison between time - integrated and time - resolved spectra , correlations among the spectral parameters , evolution of high - energy power law index ( @xmath27 ) , and the comparison between short and long bursts .",
    "the spectral parameters can be compared by two different aspects ; namely , a comparison among parameters yielded by different models , and a comparison between time - integrated and time - resolved parameters .",
    "the comparison among the models reveals the internal characteristics of each model , whereas the comparison between the time - integrated and time - resolved parameters uncovers the differences internal to the spectra .    before comparing the fitted parameters of various models , there are some issues to be discussed . as mentioned in  [ sec : models ] , the parameterizations are different in each model . for clarity ,",
    "the free parameters in each model are summarized in table  [ tab : par ] .",
    "the main concern here is the difference in the low - energy spectral indices : @xmath26 of band and comp and @xmath87 of sbpl , where @xmath26 is the asymptotic power - law index , while @xmath87 is the index of the actual power law fit to the data .",
    "the natural consequence of this is that @xmath26 tends to be harder than @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) , when fitted to the same data , which was confirmed in the simulation study presented in  [ sec : simulation ] ( we note , however , @xmath98 if @xmath48 is large and/or @xmath47 is low ) .",
    "they are , therefore , not directly comparable . in order to minimize the discrepancies , an  effective \" @xmath26 ( @xmath99 )",
    "was introduced by @xcite .",
    "this is the tangential slope at 25 kev in a logarithmic scale , and is found to describe the data more accurately than the fitted asymptotic @xmath26 value .",
    "the 25 kev is the lower energy bound of lad and therefore , @xmath99 is the index of the low - energy power law within the data energy range .",
    "therefore , we employ the @xmath99 instead of the fitted @xmath26 values for band and comp fits in the following parameter distribution comparisons",
    ". a detailed discussion of @xmath99 can be found in appendix [ ap : aleff ] .",
    "another issue in comparing and presenting the spectral parameter distributions is the uncertainty associated with each parameter .",
    "the parameter distribution in a large sample can be effectively shown in a binned , histogram plot ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : fpar_aleff ] ) ; however , such a plot does not include the uncertainties associated with each value .",
    "consequently , the reliability of the distribution is not evident .",
    "one way of treating this problem is to only include well - constrained parameters in the distribution . here",
    ", we will refer to these parameters as _ good _ parameters .",
    "this certainly results in providing a reliable probability distribution of a given parameter , although it could also introduce some biases depending on how the _ good _ class of parameters are determined . to interpret such distributions correctly , the criteria used to determine the _ good _ parameters are reviewed here .",
    "we first applied a @xmath11 goodness - of - fit criteria of @xmath100 ( 99.7% ) for a given dof for each fit , to assure that the resulting parameters are meaningful , before they can be considered _",

    "this could occur in two cases ; ( i ) the comp fits when @xmath42 ( see  [ sec : comp ] ) and ( ii ) the sbpl fits when @xmath106 .",
    "the band model presumes @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , to obtain final @xmath29 distributions , band model fits with @xmath108 and comp fits with @xmath109 are excluded ( for sbpl with @xmath110 and @xmath106 , the @xmath29 was not calculated ) .",

    "therefore , the only requirement is that the parameter is within the data energy range , namely , between 30 kev and 2 mev .",
    "this is justified by the fact that all band and sbpl fits with @xmath47 values below 30 kev and above 2 mev are associated with very large uncertainties in low - energy and high - energy indices , respectively , as well as in @xmath47 .",
    "the maximum allowed uncertainty of 70% of the parameter value was set in order to include 85 ",
    "90% of all break energies .",
    "+ with these in mind , we can now examine the spectral parameter distributions for each model .",

    "they are found to cluster around @xmath111 by themselves , which is in between the typical low - energy and high - energy indices .",
    "we note the index value agrees with the median power - law index ( @xmath112 ; index values taken from gcn circularsand the swift grb table ) of time - integrated grb spectra observed with the burst alert telescope on board _ swift _ , in the energy range of 15  150 kev .    as seen in these plots and the table ,",
    "the corresponding parameters of different models are mostly consistent with each other within the dispersion . with the use of @xmath99 ,",
    "the low - energy index distributions ( figures [ fig : fpar_aleff ] and [ fig : bpar_aleff ] ) determined by the band , comp and sbpl models all seem to agree . as for the high - energy indices ( figures [ fig : fpar_beta ] and [ fig : bpar_beta ] ) , the sbpl fits and the band fits also yielded consistent distributions . in the @xmath29 distributions ( figures [ fig : fpar_ep ] and [ fig : bpar_ep ] ) , we find that the comp fits result in higher @xmath29 values and broader distribution than the band and sbpl ones . finally , the break energy distributions seen in figures [ fig : fpar_eb ] and [ fig : bpar_eb ] indicate that the typical break energies found by the band fits are softer than the @xmath29 of the same model , due to the curvature in the spectra .",
    "the high - energy tail populations in the break energy distributions are more noticeable than the @xmath29 cases , although they are not constrained .",
    "we also present in figures  [ fig : fpar_ds ] and [ fig : bpar_ds ] , the change in the spectral indices ; @xmath113s @xmath114 ( band ) , @xmath115 ( sbpl ) .",
    "this parameter has been previously examined by @xcite using the results of sp1 , in order to probe the grb emission process in the context of the synchrotron shock model .",
    "we show this here for the comparison with the sp1 results .",
    "the distributions of @xmath113s of the band and sbpl agree well , and are also consistent with the distribution obtained by @xcite .    in terms of comparisons between the time - integrated and time - resolved spectral parameters ,",
    "the most obvious difference is seen in the low - energy index distributions .",
    "the indices of time - integrated spectra are found to be softer than the time - resolved ones , except the pwrl case .",
    "peak energies , @xmath29 , also tend to be slightly softer in the time - integrated spectra , especially when fitted with the comp model .",
    "the differences are due to the fact that @xmath26 and @xmath29 are very often observed to strongly evolve during a burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "no significant difference in high - energy index distributions is seen .      since we have fitted the four models to all spectra",
    ", it is possible to statistically compare the models and determine the best - fit model to each individual spectrum .",
    "the comparison is , however , not straightforward because each model provides a different dof .",
    "a model that consists of a lower number of parameters is always preferred statistically over more complex models for the same @xmath11 .",
    "however , the data may require an extra parameter for a better fit , in which case it should result in a significant improvement in @xmath11 when the extra parameter is fitted .",
    "therefore , we look at the @xmath11 improvements in adding @xmath116 parameters ( @xmath117 ) , starting from the simplest model ( i.e. , pwrl ) to determine the best - fit models .    the four models employed , namely pwrl , comp , band , and sbpl , consist of 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 parameters , respectively . for each spectrum , we take the @xmath11 of the pwrl fit as a reference . we first compare the pwrl fit @xmath11 to the comp fit @xmath11 for @xmath62 , and find the confidence level in @xmath11 improvement .",
    "if the confidence level is greater than 99.9% , the comp fit is significantly better than the pwrl fit ; whereas , for confidence levels between @xmath118% , we can not statistically determine the better model between the two .",
    "the best - fit model in such a case is classified as pwrl / comp .",
    "a confidence level lower than 80.0% suggests that the pwrl is preferred .",
    "likewise , comparisons were made for all possible combinations of four models , with corresponding @xmath113dof .",
    "the confidence intervals of 99.9% and 80.0% were used for all comparisons involving pwrl , while 99.9% and 68.3% were used for the comparisons among the other models .",
    "these threshold values for the confidence intervals were decided based upon the simulation results described in full detail in  [ sec : simulation ] . in the simulation",
    ", we fitted a simulated spectrum of a particular model by the other models and examined the degree of improvement in each fitting .    in most cases , the @xmath11 probability was an adequate measure of the best fit determination ; however , we found some cases where the best - fit model found by @xmath11 probability was actually not better than the other models in terms of parameter constraints .",
    "therefore , in addition to the @xmath11 probabilities , the spectral parameters were also checked , requiring reasonable constraints on the additional parameter(s ) .",
    "if the best - fit model parameters are not constrained , the next statistically best - fit model with more constrained parameters was preferred .",
    "finally , in case a preferred model could not be determined solely by changes in @xmath11 , such as the pwrl / comp case above , again their parameters were compared and a model with more constrained parameter set was designated as the best - fit model .",
    "the results of the best - fit model determination are shown in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "it is seen that for many spectra , the comp , band , and sbpl models all resulted in comparably good fits ( c / b / s case in the table  [ tab : models ] ) . in most of these cases , the additional parameters were still well constrained , and the more complex models were meaningful .",
    "consequently , the sbpl fits were selected as the best - fit models , despite the complexity of the model , in many of the c / b / s case . to illustrate the goodness of fits of each model , a count spectrum of one c / b / s burst with all four model counts",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig:8087_csp ] .",
    "moreover , for the time - resolved spectra , in almost 30% of the cases , the comp and band fits were both found to be acceptable ( i.e. , c / b ) .",
    "for these spectra , the more complex band model was able to provide adequate parameter constraints , similar to the sbpl model in the c / b / s case above . in these cases , low - energy indices from all models",
    "were usually found in agreement within 1@xmath13 uncertainties ( if @xmath99 is used ) .",
    "we also find that comp tends to be preferable in fitting time - resolved spectra , because of the existence of more spectra without high - energy component , as well as the lower s / n in each spectrum compared with the time - integrated spectra . in addition , those best - fit by pwrl ( @xmath0 5% of all spectra ) were indeed among the dimmer , low s / n spectra . in the case of sbpl fit spectra ,",
    "many spectra provided smaller break scales ( i.e. , sharper breaks ) .",
    "henceforth , we refer to this set of models as the  best \" models , consisting of pwrl , comp , band , and sbpl , each with numbers presented in the row of table [ tab : models ] .",
    "a collection of parameters obtained with the best models , with the use of @xmath99 and calculated @xmath29 and @xmath47 , can be thought as a well - constrained , model - unbiased set of parameters best describing each spectrum in our sample .",
    "the time - integrated spectral fit results obtained with the best models are presented in table [ tab : results ] , for each burst . additionally , we show the spectral parameter distributions of the best models in figures [ fig : fpar_best1 ]  [ fig : bpar_best2 ] , for both the time - integrated and time - resolved cases . in these figures ,",
    "the distributions of each parameter of the best model and the contribution of each model that consists the best model are shown .",
    "also , the median values and the dispersion of these distributions are summarized in table [ tab : mode_best ] .",
    "we find the band model tends to fit spectra with harder low - energy indices , and especially in the time - resolved case , the comp model seems to fit those with much softer indices .",
    "the spectra with positive low - energy indices are dominated by the band model fits .",
    "most of the time - resolved comp spectra with low - energy indices less than @xmath119 were found to have low @xmath120 kev .",
    "the value of low - energy index @xmath119 corresponds to the fast - cooling case of the synchrotron emission spectrum @xcite . out of the 8459 time - resolved spectra ,",
    "407 spectra resulted in the low - energy indices above the synchrotron limit of @xmath121 @xcite by more than @xmath122 .",
    "meanwhile , for the high - energy spectral index distribution of time - resolved spectra , it seems those with harder high - energy indices are better fit by the sbpl model , while those with softer indices are better fit by the band model .",
    "we also find that the majority of sbpl with high - energy indices larger than @xmath123 have small differences in low - energy and high - energy spectral indices ( @xmath113s @xmath1 1 ) .",
    "in the distributions of @xmath29 and break energy , we observe no secondary populations at energy below 100 kev , which was previously indicated by the break energy distribution of time - resolved spectra in sp1 .",
    "the distributions of @xmath29 and break energy are different mainly due to the contribution of @xmath124 mev that is dominated by comp spectra .",
    "these represent very hard spectra with the actual @xmath29 values lying very close to or higher than the upper energy bound of our datasets ( @xmath125 1 mev ) . for such spectra , band or sbpl do not provide well - constrained high - energy spectral indices , and pwrl does not accommodate well the curvature of the spectra ; therefore , the comp fits were preferred .",
    "the @xmath113s distributions in figures [ fig : fpar_best2 ] and [ fig : bpar_best2 ] ( left panels ) show that the sbpl spectra generally have much smaller changes in the indices .",
    "most of those spectra with small differences in indices @xmath113s , have sharp breaks ( @xmath126 ) , and more than a half of them have high - energy indices @xmath127 , indicating the existence of another break energy at higher energy . finally , from the photon flux plots ( right panels in figures [ fig : fpar_best2 ] and [ fig : bpar_best2 ] ) , it is also found that the simpler models ( pwrl and comp ) are best fitted to weaker spectra , compared with more complex models ( band and sbpl ) , as expected .",
    "using the set of best models determined for each time - resolved spectrum , we can also examine which parts of the burst are well fit by which models .",
    "this in turn reveals the evolution of spectral shapes within bursts . in figures [ fig:3491_bestmdl ] and [ fig:3492_bestmdl ] , we present the best models as a function of time for two example bursts that exhibit the hard - to - soft and the  tracking \" behaviors .",
    "both behaviors are defined by @xmath29 and/or low - energy index evolution , which are commonly observed in grbs @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the low - energy index and @xmath29 are also shown along with the best model histories . in the hard - to - soft burst ( figure [ fig:3491_bestmdl ] ) ,",
    "the first two - thirds is best fit by band , sbpl , or the comp with high @xmath29 .",
    "the softer tail spectra of the burst are well fit by either pwrl with index less than @xmath128 ( indicating @xmath129 kev ) or comp with low @xmath29 .",
    "the last time interval of this burst was best fit by sbpl with @xmath130 kev , but with @xmath131 ( i.e. , concave - up shape ) , due to a few sigma excess counts in one energy channel at @xmath0 440 kev .",
    "on the other hand , in the tracking burst ( figure [ fig:3492_bestmdl ] ) , the rise and fall of each peak are well fit by the low-@xmath29 comp or pwrl .      for the comparison between the time - integrated and the time - resolved spectral parameters of the best models , we plot the total distributions of time - integrated and resolved parameters in figure [ fig : fb_best1 ] .",
    "these are the total distributions presented in figures [ fig : fpar_best1 ] and [ fig : bpar_best1 ] , but are now plotted on top of each other . also the median values of each parameter are summarized in table [ tab : spec_param ] , along with the dispersion of the distributions . in order to determine",
    "if the distributions of the time - integrated and time - resolved spectral parameters are consistent , we employed the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test @xcite .",
    "the k - s test determines the parameter @xmath132 , which measures the maximum difference in the cumulative probability distributions over parameter space , and the significance probability @xmath133 for the value of @xmath132 .",
    "the null hypothesis is that the two datasets are drawn from the same parent distributions ; therefore , a small @xmath133 rejects the hypothesis and indicates that the datasets are likely to be different .",
    "determined by the k - s statistics , we find a significant difference in the low - energy spectral index distributions of time - integrated and time - resolved spectra , with @xmath133 of 10@xmath134 ( @xmath132 = 0.23 ) . also , a less significant difference was found between the @xmath29 distributions with @xmath133 of 8 @xmath16 10@xmath135 ( @xmath132 = 0.10 ) .",
    "the distributions of the high - energy index and the break energy were consistent .",
    "this is in agreement with what we observed in the parameter distributions of individual model fits earlier (  [ sec : par_dist ] ; figures [ fig : fpar_aleff ]  [ fig : bpar_eb ] and table [ tab : mode_all ] ) , and is , again , due to the spectral evolution within each burst .",
    "we also compare the time - integrated and time - resolved distributions of sbpl break scales @xmath48 and @xmath113s in figure [ fig : fb_best2 ] .",
    "it can be seen from the break scale comparison that the time - integrated sbpl spectra are smoother ( larger break scales ) than the time - resolved ones .",
    "this is naturally expected because the integrated spectra are summations of resolved spectra with possibly various @xmath47 values , and therefore , any sharp break features may be smeared over . for the same reason , the tendency of smaller @xmath113s observed in integrated spectra is expected as well .",
    "it has been a common practice to fit the same broken - power law model ( band in particular ) to both time - integrated and time - resolved spectra .",
    "the model usually yields sufficiently good fits to both types of spectra ; however , if the time - integrated spectrum consists of a set of broken - power law spectra with evolving break energy and indices , it is possible that the time - integrated spectra deviates from a broken - power law shape .",
    "often , we do observe some indication of such deviations in the residual patterns obtained from time - integrated spectral fits to broken - power law models . to probe this",
    ", we explored how each time - resolved spectrum contributes to the time - integrated spectrum .",
    "the time - integrated spectra are usually considered as  average \" spectra ; however , averaging ( whether error / intensity - weighted or not ) the best - fit spectral parameters from each time - resolved spectrum does not yield the best - fit time - integrated spectral parameters .",
    "this is because the time - integrated spectra are averaged over count space rather than parameter space .",
    "consequently , if each of the fitted time - resolved spectral models are indeed accurately representing the observed spectral data , summing over the model photon counts should reveal more accurate time - integrated photon spectrum .",
    "therefore , for each of 333 bursts ( excluding 17 grbs with single spectra ) , we obtained the time - integrated photon flux by summing the best model photon counts in the time - resolved spectra and dividing by their total durations ; @xmath136 here , @xmath137 is the best model photon flux of each time - resolved spectrum as a function of photon energy , and @xmath138 is the accumulation time of each spectrum .",
    "the initial visual comparisons of @xmath139 plotted over the best - fit time - integrated spectral models suggested that they agree remarkably well for most of the grbs in our sample . for quantitative comparisons of @xmath139 to the actual best model photon flux , we employed the @xmath11 statistic @xcite : @xmath140 where @xmath116 is a number of energy bins",
    ", @xmath141 denotes @xmath139 per energy bin , @xmath142 is the actual time - integrated best model photon flux per energy bin , and @xmath143 is the variance associated with @xmath142 obtained from the fits . for each burst ,",
    "the @xmath144 statistics and the corresponding significance probability , @xmath145 , were determined ( for @xmath116 dof ) .",
    "based on the statistic , 29% of 333 bursts were rejected at 99% confidence level ( i.e. , @xmath146% ) due to large @xmath11 , and therefore , @xmath147 was different from @xmath148 .",
    "an example of such bursts is shown in figure [ fig:6198_spec ] .",
    "we found that these bursts with very small @xmath145 values were of the brightest of the burst sample in terms of peak photon flux ( figure [ fig : maxp ] ) .",
    "many of these bursts resulted in large @xmath144 because the brightest spectrum within the burst tends to dominate in the summation process .",
    "this caused @xmath147 to consistently have much larger flux than the best model photon flux , as seen in figure [ fig:6198_spec ] .",
    "the time - integrated spectral fits for most of these bursts also resulted in statistically poor spectral fits , with @xmath11 goodness of fit worse than @xmath122 , even with the best models . in very bright bursts ,",
    "the contribution of systematic uncertainties in the data is generally expected to be more evident ( see figure [ fig : system ] ) . as a result",
    ", the best - fit photon models may not represent the actual spectral shapes for these bursts .",
    "we also found that the majority of the bursts for which mer data were used fall into the group of small @xmath145 .",
    "this is likely because there are more systematic uncertainties present in the multiple - detector mer data than the single - detector herb or cont data .",
    "in addition , the mer bursts in this group tend to consist of a larger number of spectra .",
    "this is because the mer data type was used when the corresponding herb data were incomplete , which occurs frequently in the case of very bright bursts .",
    "furthermore , among the small-@xmath145 group , there are some bursts where the constructed photon flux @xmath149 seems to follow the actual time - integrated photon data points ( deconvolved with best models ) very well .",
    "one such example is shown in the figure [ fig:6630flnc_sp ] , for grb 980306 ( batse trigger number 6630 ) .",
    "although there seems be a slight offset in amplitude , it is remarkable that the shape of constructed photon flux ( @xmath147 ; dashed line ) traces the actual deconvolved data points of the time - integrated spectrum .",
    "the time - integrated spectral fit for this burst is still acceptable ( @xmath150 ; see table [ tab : results ] ) ; however , the deviations of the real spectral shape from a smoothly - broken power - law model are evident .    from these",
    ", we infer that the time - integrated spectrum can be constructed by summing over the photon model counts of each time - resolved spectra within the burst ( equation [ eqn : sumspec ] ) , provided that the best model in each time - resolved spectrum is an accurate representation of the observed spectral shape",
    ". the actual time - integrated spectrum may not be as simple as the best models fit to the spectrum , due to spectral evolution .",
    "the bursts with peak photon flux larger than @xmath75 photons s@xmath2 @xmath3 will likely suffer from large systematic uncertainties , with the results that the constructed spectrum does not represent the actual spectral shape , or has a shape that differs greatly from the best - fit model .",
    "therefore , the fitted spectral parameters of the time - integrated spectra may only represent the best parameter possibly fit by our simple models that are limited in their spectral shapes .",
    "the spectral parameter distributions should be interpreted with this in mind .",
    "this may also be applicable to the time - resolved spectra given that the cooling timescales ( both radiative and dynamical ) can be much shorter than the integration times of each spectrum .",
    "some empirical correlations among grb spectral parameters , such as between @xmath29 and low - energy index , have previously been reported with smaller samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correlations were found either within individual bursts or for a collection of time - resolved parameters . from inspection of scatter plots of the best parameters , we found no indication of strong global correlations among the time - integrated spectral parameters . on the other hand , among the time - resolved spectral parameters , broad positive trends between @xmath151low - energy index , @xmath152low - energy index , and @xmath151high - energy index , were visible in the scatter plots . to probe the existence of correlations among the spectral parameters derived from our sample",
    ", we calculated the spearman rank - order correlation coefficients , @xmath153 , and the associated significance probabilities , @xmath154 @xcite , for several combinations of spectral parameters of the best models .",
    "the null hypothesis is that no correlation exists ; therefore , a small @xmath154 indicates a significant correlation .    to eliminate the possible effects of a dispersion of @xmath29 and @xmath47 due to the cosmological redshift ( @xmath155 ) that varies from burst to burst ,",
    "it is best to look for parameter correlations within individual bursts . for each burst with a sufficient number of data points ( @xmath156 ) in our sample",
    ", we examined the correlations between combinations of low - energy and high - energy indices , @xmath29 , and @xmath47 , by determining @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "we use the best model parameters of each time - resolved spectrum within bursts , and also , for simplicity , we denote the low - energy and high - energy indices of the best model as @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , in this section . the number of parameter pairs ( @xmath116 ) in each burst was less than or equal to the number of time - resolved spectra ; however , this varied according to which parameter pair was considered since we used the best model parameters and certain parameters are not obtainable for certain resolved spectra .",
    "for example , within the same burst , it is possible that for an @xmath157 correlation , @xmath158 pairs were available , but for @xmath159 only @xmath160 were available . for most of the cases , @xmath116 was @xmath125 80% of the number of spectra and was always more than 10 .",
    "we note that the @xmath154 values take into account the actual @xmath116 in the calculation that determines each correlation significance .",
    "the resulting numbers of bursts considered for each correlation were summarized in table [ tab : corr_sum ] along with percentages of bursts with significant correlations between each pair of parameters .",
    "we considered the correlation significant if @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath153 and the associated @xmath154 of the bursts that showed significant correlations in at least one of the parameter pairs are listed in table [ tab : corr ] .    to illustrate some of the strong correlations , we show example scatter plots of each type of parameter pairs in figure [ fig : corr ] .",
    "the strongest positive correlation is found between @xmath29 and @xmath26 , in 26% of the bursts . in many cases ,",
    "the chance probabilities of these correlations are extremely low .",
    "positive correlations between @xmath163 are also evident , although only in half of the fraction of the @xmath29 cases .",
    "we note that the results were not significantly altered when unadjusted low - energy index ( regular @xmath26 for band and comp ) were used , instead of @xmath99 that we use here for the best model parameters .",
    "the @xmath47 value is equal to the @xmath29 value only when a spectrum has a sharp break .",
    "otherwise , a break scale or curvature determines the relation between them .",
    "therefore , the same degree of correlation is not expected for @xmath47 and @xmath29 . on the contrary , the @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 correlations",
    "are found in a much lower fraction of the bursts than the @xmath47/@xmath29 and @xmath26 cases , and are mostly negative .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the uncertainty associated with each parameter is not taken into account in determining the rank - order correlation , and @xmath27 is usually associated with relatively larger uncertainties than the other parameters .",
    "this can be seen in the scatter plots in figure [ fig : corr ] .",
    "the measurement uncertainties may have masked an actual correlation .",
    "we have also found significant positive correlations between @xmath29 and the time - resolved photon flux in 28% of grbs , and between @xmath26 and the photon flux ( 42% ) , indicating the tracking behavior .",
    "about 18% of grbs with the @xmath151flux correlation also belong to the group with the @xmath167flux correlation , and therefore show strong tracking behavior in both @xmath29 and @xmath26 .",
    "some of these also display overall hard - to - soft behavior , indicated by strong correlations of the parameters with time .",
    "these correlations among the spectral parameters should be accounted for within an emission model .",
    "the observed correlations between fitted model parameters indicate possible correlations between physical parameters at the grb emitting region .",
    "for example , according to the synchrotron shock model , @xmath29 should be related to the magnetic field strength and the minimum energy of accelerated electrons @xcite , whereas low - energy index may depend on the electron pitch - angle distribution or density of the absorbing medium @xcite . on the other hand , in the jitter radiation model",
    ", @xmath29 varies with the ratio between deflection and beaming angles of an emitting electron , and low - energy index depends on the ratio of strengths of large - scale and small - scale magnetic fields existing at the shock @xcite .",
    "finally , global correlations between the time - integrated @xmath29 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and energy or photon flux / fluence values ( including peak photon flux ) were also investigated .",
    "we found only one relatively significant correlation , between @xmath29 and total energy fluence , with @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "one of the most highly cited empirical correlations is the @xmath170 correlation found by @xcite .",
    "the amati relation is @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the peak energy in the source rest frame , namely , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 is an isotropic equivalent total emitted energy for a given distance .",
    "the relation was found by using a dozen grbs observed with _ bepposax _ with known redshift values @xmath155 .",
    "if true , such a correlation can provide strong constraints on the grb emission mechanism and the fundamental nature of grbs .",
    "it has recently been shown , however , that the amati relation suffers from a strong selection effect and is greatly inconsistent with a larger set of grb data obtained with batse @xcite .",
    "this was indicated by a limit in observed @xmath29 and energy fluence values ( and therefore independent of redshift ) that is implied by the amati relation .",
    "responding to the results , @xcite argued that taking into account the intrinsic scatter of the relation , the batse bursts may still be consistent .",
    "this claim , however , has also been challenged @xcite . to show how @xmath29 and energy fluence values in our sample are correlated , we plot @xmath29 vs.  total energy fluence in figure [ fig : eflnc_ep ] . on the scatter plot",
    ", we also show the limit on the amati relation and the maximum 3@xmath13 limit derived by @xcite .",

    ", we confirm that most of our bursts are significantly inconsistent with the amati limit .",
    "even for the 3@xmath13 ghirlanda limit , we observe more outliers than they found in their work .",
    "our well - constrained parameters strongly indicate that the amati relation is only valid for a small sample of selected bursts .",
    "since the beta model is a variation of the band model , we did not include the beta model in obtaining the overall model statistics above .",
    "the purpose of this model is to test whether the high - energy power - law index , @xmath27 , stays constant for the entire duration of a burst , which is expected in the simplest shock acceleration and the grb emission scenario .",
    "earlier work by @xcite found that 34% of 122 grbs investigated were inconsistent with the constant-@xmath27 hypothesis .",
    "note that most grbs in their sample overlaps with the sample presented herein . in @xcite , the @xmath27 values that were used as",
    "the constant values were the error - weighted average of @xmath27 obtained from fits to each of time - resolved spectra within bursts .",
    "these values are different from those obtained by the time - integrated fits , due to the following reasons .",
    "spectra with higher s / n usually have smaller error associated with their fits .",
    "therefore , they have more weight in determining the error - weighted average of @xmath27 .",
    "these spectra , however , may have much shorter integration times , because of the binning by s / n as well as the characteristics of herb data ( also used in @xcite ) . despite their large photon flux values , they may not provide large photon fluence counts due to the short time intervals . as discussed in the earlier section (  [ sec : flnc_vs_res ] ) , the time - integrated spectrum can be obtained by summing over the photon counts ( not count rate ) rather than error - weighted averaging of parameters .",
    "this resulted in the values used to test the constancy of the index in @xcite to be higher than those obtained from fits to the time - integrated spectra , which are used in this work .    in order to have sufficient time samples to study the time evolution of @xmath27 , as well as to be consistent with the @xcite analysis , our sample was limited to bursts that consist of at least eight spectra .",
    "additionally , there were some cases in which the time - integrated @xmath27 values were less than @xmath175 by more than 1@xmath13 , and thus lacking the high - energy power - law component ( i.e. , comp - like spectra ) . in these cases , fitting the time - resolved spectra with these small values is not meaningful for our purpose here , and therefore , those bursts were also excluded .",
    "the remaining total number of bursts in the sample was 210 .    to determine whether @xmath27 is consistent with being constant throughout a burst , we checked the resulting @xmath11 of the beta model fit to each time - resolved spectrum and calculated the corresponding goodness of fit .",
    "the maximum goodness of fit allowed was set to an equivalent chance probability of one per number - of - spectra in each burst in order to take into account the number of trials in each case : in other words , one spectrum in each burst was statistically expected not to give an acceptable beta fit .",
    "consequently , the goodness - of - fit allowed was always at least @xmath176% ( corresponding to a minimum number of spectra of eight ) .",
    "then , if all but one spectrum within a burst resulted in @xmath11 probabilities less than the given maximum goodness - of - fit level , the burst was considered to be consistent with having a constant @xmath27 .",
    "we call these bursts  constant-@xmath27 grbs \" and the others  varying-@xmath27 grbs \" hereafter .",
    "we found that nearly a half of the sample ( 108 out of 210 grbs ) are varying-@xmath27 grbs .",
    "the result differs from the result of 34% that was obtained by @xcite , who searched for a correlation between @xmath27 and time .",

    "our sample includes 17 short bursts ( @xmath181 s ) , which are listed in table [ tab : short ] .",

    "there is no significant difference between the spectral parameters of the short bursts and the rest ( long bursts ) , in both time - integrated and time - resolved spectra .",
    "this may be expected since our sample is limited to the brightest bursts , whereas the sample used in @xcite did not have such selection effects .",
    "@xcite found that brighter bursts tend to be harder , and our sample here belongs to the brightest of the five groups defined by @xcite . besides , we used mostly herb data for the short bursts , which may be missing a substantial portion of the emission of the short bursts due to the accumulation start time of the herb data ( @xmath182 64 ms after burst onset time ) . three short bursts , grbs 920414 , 980228 , and 000326 ( batse trigger numbers 1553 , 6617 , and 8053 ) , were bright enough to provide three to five time - resolved spectra ,",

    "the dispersions in the low - energy and high - energy index distributions were found to be comparable , @xmath186 .",
    "for the first time , @xmath29 and break energy , at which the two power laws are joined , have been made distinct .",
    "we presented the @xmath29 and break energy distributions separately , and found that @xmath29 tends to be harder than the break energy .",
    "this is due to the existence of curvature in spectra .",
    "@xmath29 becomes break energy only in a sharply - broken power - law spectrum .",
    "the @xmath29 distribution peaks at @xmath9 kev while that of the break energy peaks at @xmath187 kev , both with very narrow width of @xmath188 kev .",
    "we now know that there exist fainter , softer grbs with lower @xmath29 that batse would not have detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; therefore , the actual observed @xmath29 distribution of grbs should extend to a lower energy .",
    "the narrowness of the distributions , if real , implies an extremely narrow intrinsic distribution of these parameters , and poses a challenge for the internal shock model of grb prompt emission @xcite .",
    "there are small populations of grbs ( 7% of time - resolved spectra ) that have high - energy indices above 2 by more than 3@xmath13 .",
    "this indicates that there may be a small tail population of spectra with @xmath189 mev .",
    "it must be noted that the time - resolved spectral analysis results obtained here may be biased by the brighter ( higher photon flux ) portions of each burst because the herb data type was designed to sample more frequently during the intense episodes .",
    "since the @xmath29 values tend to be correlated with the photon flux in general @xcite , the spectra with higher @xmath29 might be over - sampled whereas those with lower @xmath29 are likely to be under - sampled .",
    "this may partially explain the differences observed in the @xmath29 distributions of time - integrated and resolved spectra .",
    "similarly , the low - energy indices also tend to correlate with @xmath29 ; therefore , the same type of bias may exist in the low - energy index distribution as well .",
    "we have also explored time - integrated spectra by reconstructing them from the time - resolved spectra , and identified cases where the actual integrated spectra deviate from the simple broken power - law model , due to spectral evolution within the integration time .",
    "therefore , fine time resolution data are crucial to more accurately represent the spectral shape using a relatively simple model . significant correlations among parameters are also observed in some grbs .",
    "the most evident positive correlation is found between @xmath29 and the low - energy index , in 26% of grbs considered . since our parameter sets are well constrained and unbiased by photon models , the correlations found are more likely to reflect intrinsic properties of grbs , rather than the instrumental or other systematic effects , as has been pointed out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a mild global correlation between @xmath29 and energy fluence in our sample was found .",
    "the significance of the correlation is much lower than what was found previously by @xcite , with a larger sample including many more dimmer bursts .    in its simplest picture",
    ", the synchrotron shock model assumes that the electrons are accelerated by the first - order fermi mechanism to a power - law distribution ( @xmath190 ) , which does not evolve in time .",
    "the electron index @xmath37 is then related to @xmath27 either as @xmath191 in case of the fast - cooling synchrotron spectrum , or as @xmath192 in case of non - cooling synchrotron @xcite .",
    "our constant @xmath193 then indicates @xmath194 or @xmath195 , respectively .",
    "the ultra - relativistic fermi - type acceleration results in @xmath196 @xcite ; therefore , if indeed the electron distribution remain unchanged within a grb , the fast radiative cooling of the electrons are more likely to be in effect at the source , as has been suggested @xcite . however , we found , using the beta model , that 51% of 210 grbs considered are inconsistent with the constant-@xmath27 hypothesis .",
    "finally , we found no significant difference between the spectral parameters of 17 short bursts and long bursts in our sample , which is possibly due to the instrumental effects .",
    "in addition , spectral evolutions , hard - to - soft or tracking , were found in three of the short bursts with enough number of time - resolved spectra .",
    "these evolution patterns are often observed in individual peaks of long grbs .",
    "it is important to note that the analysis presented here only includes bright grbs , which tend be spectrally harder in general than dim grbs .",
    "the global correlations we studied here between the spectral hardness and the burst intensity ( flux and fluence ) , would probably change somewhat , if dimmer bursts were included .",
    "another sample selection bias exists against very short grbs , due to the fact that we used the peak photon flux in 256 ms to determine the brightness of the bursts .",
    "many bright short grbs have duration much shorter than 256 ms , in which case the photon flux with 256-ms integration time may smear out the brightness .",
    "the short grbs included in our analysis , therefore , have duration @xmath125 256 ms , and only comprises less than 5% of our sample of 350 bursts .",
    "this is much less than the fraction of short grbs in the entire batse grb sample ( @xmath0 19% ) . the grb spectral database obtained in this work",
    "is derived from the most sensitive and largest database to date .",
    "therefore , these results set a standard for spectral properties of grb prompt emission with exceptional statistics .",
    "our analysis results can provide reliable constraints for existing and future theoretical models of the particle acceleration and grb emission mechanisms .",
    "the spectral database also allows for the spectral evolutions within each burst to be taken into consideration when constraining such models .",
    "the basic concept is that the power - law index changes smoothly from the low - energy index ( @xmath87 ) to high - energy index ( @xmath88 ) . since @xmath131 in general , we assume the index change is described by a negative hyperbolic tangent function , namely @xmath197 , as plotted in figure [ fig : tanh ] .",

    "the correction term is larger for lower @xmath101 values . in figure",
    "[ fig : band_aleff ] , we compare the band @xmath26 and @xmath99 of the time - resolved spectra in our sample . as seen in figure [ fig : band_aleff ] , @xmath99 correction lowers the index values , making them more consistent with @xmath87 of sbpl ( figure [ fig : bpar_aleff ] , bottom right panel ) .",
    "the correlation term neglected above is @xmath292 = 2\\left[r_{e_{\\rm peak},\\alpha } \\sigma_{e_{\\rm peak}}\\sigma_{\\alpha }     \\frac{25 ( 2 + \\alpha)}{e_{\\rm peak}^2 }     \\left(1 - \\frac{25}{e_{\\rm peak}}\\right ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath293 was found to be negative ( see  [ sec : band_err ] ) .",
    "consequently , the error estimated from equation [ eqn : aleff_var ] may also be larger than the actual values .",

    "<S> we present a systematic spectral analysis of 350 bright gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ; @xmath0 30 kev  2 mev ) with high temporal and spectral resolution . </S>",
    "<S> our sample was selected from the complete set of 2704 batse grbs based on their energy fluence or peak photon flux values to assure good statistics , and included 17 short grbs . to obtain well - constrained spectral parameters , </S>",
    "<S> several photon models were used to fit each spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we compared spectral parameters resulting from the fits using different models , and the spectral parameters that best represent each spectrum were statistically determined , taking into account the parameterization differences among the models . </S>",
    "<S> a thorough analysis was performed on 350 time - integrated and 8459 time - resolved burst spectra , and the effects of integration times in determining the spectral parameters were explored . using the results , we studied correlations among spectral parameters and their evolution pattern within each burst . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectral catalog is the most comprehensive study of spectral properties of grb prompt emission to date , and is available electronically from the high - energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog provides reliable constraints on particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in grbs . </S>"
