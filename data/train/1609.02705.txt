    "in the issue of communications in mathematical physics dedicated to rudolf haag s 80th birthday , brunetti , fredenhagen and verch  @xcite introduced _ locally covariant quantum field theory _ , a formulation of qft in curved spacetimes that is a far - reaching generalization of haag s framework of local quantum physics  @xcite ( also called algebraic qft ) . locally covariant qfts are expressed as functors from a category of spacetimes @xmath3 to a category of physical systems @xmath4 .",
    "the morphisms of @xmath3 correspond to embeddings of one spacetime as a subspacetime of another , while the morphisms of @xmath4 correspond to embeddings of one physical system as a subsystem of another .",
    "a functor @xmath5 therefore associates a physical system to every spacetime and also specifies how each spacetime embedding gives an embedding of these physical systems .",
    "thus , @xmath6 defines the theory on all spacetimes and incorporates the principle of locality from the start .",
    "locally covariant qft has proved to be a fruitful framework for the general analysis of qft in curved spacetime and has allowed various structural results or properties of flat spacetime qft to be transferred to curved spacetimes ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "examples include the spin - statistics connection  @xcite , the analysis of superselection sectors  , reeh  schlieder and split properties  @xcite , punctured haag duality  @xcite , and modular nuclearity  @xcite ; one can also discuss the question of whether a theory represents the same physics in all spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "these ideas also play a central role in constructions of perturbative qft in curved spacetimes  .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate and prove an analogue of the coleman ",
    "mandula ( cm ) theorem  @xcite for locally covariant qft on general parallelizable globally hyperbolic spacetimes of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the cm theorem originated as part of an intensive effort in the 1960 s to understand whether the internal and poincar symmetries of a qft in minkowski space could be combined ( ` mixed ' ) in a larger symmetry group other than as a direct product .",
    "these investigations led to a series of no - go theorems of increasing scope based on group theoretic grounds  @xcite or , as with the cm result itself ( and its generalizations to dimensions @xmath7",
    "@xcite ) , on dynamical considerations centred on the @xmath8-matrix .",
    "later , supersymmetry offered a potential loophole to these results , because fermionic charges interchange bosonic and fermionic fields and therefore also change spin .",
    "one of haag s most highly cited papers was his joint work with opuszaski and sohnius  @xcite , in which they showed that the structure of the super lie algebra in theories obeying certain basic requirements is tightly constrained : in the massive case , for example , internal and poincar symmetries commute and the fermionic charges must commute with translations and transform as rank-@xmath9 spinors under the lorentz group .    the cm theorem concerns a particular spacetime of high symmetry . for a generic spacetime with trivial isometry group , it is obvious that the internal and geometric symmetries combine as a direct product , and one might think that the cm theorem has nothing to say except for spacetimes of high symmetry ( see  @xcite for a recent cm analogue in de sitter spacetime ) .",
    "however , the viewpoint of locally covariant qft suggests a different approach . rather than focus on particular spacetimes , we will prove a result ( theorem  [ thm : cm ] ) that applies to the theory across _ all _ spacetimes , and is expressed in terms of properties of the corresponding functor .",
    "we caution that our result should not be viewed as a direct generalization of the cm theorem , but nonetheless maintain that it is a natural analogue thereof in the context of locally covariant qft .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cm ] shares with the cm theorem an emphasis on dynamics , but its method of proof is quite different , and the statement differs from the cm theorem in important respects : notably , it is valid in all spacetime dimensions @xmath0 and it is not assumed that the qft in question is interacting  whereas there are well - known free theories and two - dimensional models that evade cm .",
    "we comment more on these points below after first explaining the main ideas of our approach .",
    "it is necessary to recall two ways in which symmetry can be exhibited by a locally covariant theory @xmath5 .",
    "first , the _ spacetime symmetries _ of a spacetime @xmath10 are just the automorphisms @xmath11 in @xmath3 .",
    "any such automorphism is mapped automatically to an automorphism @xmath12 of the physical system @xmath13 of the theory on @xmath10 , and for two such symmetries one has @xmath14 by functoriality . in this way ,",
    "the ( generically trivial ) group @xmath15 of spacetime symmetries of @xmath10 is represented in the automorphism group of @xmath13 .",
    "second , the _ internal symmetries _ of the theory have a natural description .",
    "any functor @xmath6 has an associated group , @xmath16 , consisting of all natural isomorphisms of @xmath6 to itself . in locally covariant qft",
    ", @xmath16 is the global gauge group of the theory  @xcite .",
    "it follows from the definition that internal symmetries commute with spacetime symmetries .",
    "for this reason we will focus on their combination with the lorentz group .    in order to give the lorentz group some purchase in curved spacetimes , theorem  [ thm : cm ]",
    "is formulated for locally covariant theories defined on @xmath17 , the category of all @xmath18-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes equipped with a global coframe @xmath19 for the metric @xmath20 . among other requirements , a @xmath21-morphism @xmath22 between spacetimes with frames @xmath23 and @xmath24 obeys @xmath25 ( see section  [ sec : locfloc ] ) . the category @xmath21 provides a minimal setting for general locally covariant theories and was introduced in order to discuss the spin - statistics connection  @xcite ; it has also found use in the perturbative programme  @xcite . for our purposes",
    "the key point is that the restricted lorentz group @xmath26 acts on @xmath21 , by modifying the coframe as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "this group action leaves the metric and ( time)-orientation unchanged , and physical theories should be covariant with respect to it .",
    "lorentz covariance in this sense is neither an internal nor a spacetime symmetry ( indeed , it maps between backgrounds that are not generally linked by any morphism of @xmath21 ) .",
    "a similar situation occurs for rigid scaling , which also acts on @xmath21 and the category @xmath29 often used in locally covariant qft ; not all theories display rigid scale covariance , but it is useful to be able to distinguish and analyze those that do . we therefore make a systematic analysis of theories that are covariant under a group action on @xmath3 ( section  [ sec : wga ] ) and illustrate it using rigid scaling ( section  [ sec : scaling ] ) before passing to the discussion of lorentz symmetry and our main result ( section  [ sec : cm ] ) .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "suppose a group @xmath1 acts functorially on the category @xmath3 so that @xmath30 maps any spacetime @xmath10 to some @xmath31 and each morphism @xmath32 to some @xmath33 , with the identity acting trivially and @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "given a theory @xmath5 , each element @xmath30 determines a new theory @xmath36 obtained by defining @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    ", to avoid a proliferation of inverses .",
    "] we say that @xmath6 is @xmath1-covariant if all these theories are physically equivalent , meaning that there is a natural isomorphism between @xmath6 and each @xmath36 .",
    "as will be shown , these isomorphisms determine a group @xmath39-cocycle of @xmath1 with coefficients in the ( potentially nonabelian ) gauge group @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out ( theorem  [ thm : cohom ] ) that this @xmath39-cocycle is intrinsic to @xmath6 ; any other system of isomorphisms between @xmath6 and the @xmath36 results in a cohomologous @xmath39-cocycle ; in other words the @xmath1-covariance determines a distinguished cohomology class @xmath40_g\\in h^2(g,\\operatorname{aut}({{\\mathscr a}}))$ ] .",
    "associated with this class is a canonical group extension @xmath41 of @xmath1 by @xmath16 , under which the fields of the theory transform in multiplets ( theorem  [ thm : grouprep ] ) .",
    "a key question is whether such @xmath41-multiplets might contain inequivalent submultiplets for the action of @xmath1 that are mixed under the action of @xmath41 .",
    "this can be excluded ( for irreducible @xmath1-multiplets ) if @xmath41 is simply a direct product @xmath42 , which holds if @xmath40_g$ ] is trivial ( corollary  [ cor : nomix ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cm ] uses this general analysis to prove that any theory defined on @xmath21 obeying the timeslice property , additivity and dynamical local lorentz invariance is @xmath2-covariant with a trivial @xmath39-cocycle , where @xmath2 is the universal covering of the restricted lorentz group .",
    "these conditions will be described in detail later ; the first two are standard and express the existence of dynamics and the ability to build up the theory from subspacetimes ( as expected for a theory of quantum fields ) .",
    "the third uses relative cauchy evolution  @xcite , the dynamical response to perturbations in the background structures , to express invariance with respect to local changes of frame .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cm ] is proved by an explicit geometrical construction , using smooth deformations of the background frame to connect a given framed spacetime @xmath10 to one which differs from it only by a rigid lorentz rotation of the frame @xmath43 .",
    "the timeslice property induces an isomorphism between @xmath13 and @xmath44 which depends on the deformation only via its homotopy class ( as a result of local dynamical lorentz invariance ) so the covering group @xmath2 enters in a manner reminiscent of dirac s belt trick .",
    "one then shows these individual isomorphisms implement @xmath2-covariance with trivial @xmath39-cocycle . as a consequence ,",
    "the extended group is a direct product @xmath45 , and all fields of the theory transform in multiplets under true representations of @xmath2 .",
    "further , the possibility of noninteger spin can be related to the structure of the centre of the global gauge group .",
    "thus , a theory of observables alone , with trivial global gauge group , can only admit integer spin ; the same is true , for different reasons , of any theory initially defined on the category @xmath29 of globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "we have mentioned that theorem  [ thm : cm ] drops some crucial assumptions of the cm theorem . for example , the cm theorem requires interaction because some free minkowski theories have symmetries that mix fields of different spin .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cm ] replaces this by the assumption that the theory can be formulated in all spacetimes in a locally covariant fashion and that the symmetries under discussion are present in general spacetimes . to illustrate the point , consider free scalar and proca fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 with equal nonzero mass in @xmath48 minkowski space .",
    "the current @xmath49 is conserved on - shell and generates a group action that mixes @xmath46 and @xmath47 in a nonlocal fashion  @xcite .",
    "however , this symmetry does not extend to curved spacetimes by covariant derivatives , @xmath50 on - shell , for example ; in general there is no conserved rank-@xmath39 combination of @xmath46 and @xmath47 and their derivatives .",
    "] and so there is no contradiction with theorem  [ thm : cm ] : from a curved spacetime perspective , this higher spin symmetry is a quirk of the vacuum representation of the minkowski theory .",
    "similar remarks apply to factorizing models in @xmath51 minkowski space that evade the cm theorem  @xcite .",
    "further comments and extensions are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "three categories of spacetimes will be needed : @xmath29 , @xmath21 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath29 is the category of oriented globally hyperbolic spacetimes  @xcite with objects @xmath53 comprising a smooth paracompact manifold @xmath54 of fixed dimension @xmath0 and at most finitely many components , a smooth lorentzian metric @xmath55 on @xmath54 with signature @xmath56 , and an orientation @xmath57 and time - orientation @xmath58 represented as equivalence classes of nonvanishing @xmath18-forms or time - like @xmath9-forms .",
    "it is required that @xmath10 be globally hyperbolic : every @xmath59 is compact ( @xmath60 ) ; equivalently @xmath10 has cauchy surfaces .",
    "morphisms in @xmath29 are smooth isometric embeddings , preserving the orientation and time - orientation , and with causally convex image ; thus all causal relations between points in the image of a morphism are already present in its domain .",
    "@xmath21 is the category of framed globally hyperbolic spacetimes , the objects of which are all pairs @xmath61 , where @xmath54 is a smooth @xmath18-dimensional manifold with smooth global coframe @xmath62 such that @xmath63,[e^0])\\ ] ] defines an object of @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the _",
    "@xmath23-metric _ , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 $ ] is the equivalence class of nonvanishing @xmath23-timelike covector fields containing @xmath67 , and @xmath68 $ ] is the equivalence class of nonvanishing @xmath18-forms containing @xmath69 .",
    "thus we form the spacetime metric and ( time-)orientation from the coframe and require the resulting structure to be globally hyperbolic .",
    "a morphism @xmath70 in @xmath21 is determined by a smooth map @xmath71 that induces a @xmath29-morphism @xmath72 and obeys @xmath73 . in this way ,",
    "@xmath74 is promoted to a functor @xmath75 .    finally , @xmath52 is the category of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with spin structure , restricting to those for which the spin bundle is trivial ( which includes all orientable globally hyperbolic spacetimes in @xmath48 dimensions  @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be the universal cover of the restricted lorentz group @xmath76 , with covering homomorphism @xmath77 . in brief , the objects of @xmath52 are exactly those of @xmath21 , but a @xmath52 morphism from @xmath78 to @xmath79 is a pair @xmath80 where the @xmath29-morphism @xmath81 and map @xmath82 obey @xmath83 .",
    "composition of morphisms is given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 .",

    "therefore any theory @xmath6 on @xmath29 induces theories @xmath93 on @xmath52 and @xmath94 on @xmath21 , while any theory @xmath95 on @xmath52 ( e.g. , the dirac field  @xcite ) induces a theory @xmath96 on @xmath21 .    the category @xmath21 has a number of advantages : it is an operationally motivated arena for curved spacetime physics in which measurements are made with respect to a system of rods and clocks . unlike @xmath29",
    ", it admits theories of both integer and noninteger spin ; unlike @xmath52 , the objects and morphisms are given entirely in terms of observable structures .",
    "all three categories admit physically relevant group actions :    [ ex : scaling ] the multiplicative group @xmath97 acts on @xmath29 by rigid metric scaling : for each @xmath98 , there is a functor @xmath99 defined on objects by @xmath100 and so that @xmath101 has the same underlying map of manifolds as @xmath22 for any morphism @xmath22 of @xmath29 .",
    "the length of a curve in @xmath102 is @xmath103 times its length in @xmath10 ; alternatively , one may think of @xmath102 as a version of @xmath10 in which the fundamental unit of length has been divided by @xmath103 .",
    "given a theory @xmath104 we obtain a new theory @xmath105 for each @xmath98 ; the theory is ( rigidly ) scale covariant if all these theories are equivalent , i.e. , naturally isomorphic functors  see section  [ sec : scaling ] for a specific example .",
