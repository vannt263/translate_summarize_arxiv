    "@xcite , also known as ruppeiner geometry , of various black hole ( bh ) families .",
    "this has been studied over the past few years in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and recently in @xcite among several dozens of papers devoted to the use of this method to study bhs .",
    "our results so far have been physically suggestive @xcite , particularly in the myers - perry ( mp ) kerr bh case where the curvature singularities signal the initial onset of thermodynamic instability of such bh .",
    "the geometrical patterns are given by the curvature of the ruppeiner metric where @xmath0 is thermodynamic temperature of the system of interest .",
    "] defined as the hessian of the entropy on the state space of the thermodynamic system @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes mass ( internal energy ) and @xmath3 are other parameters such as charge and spin .",
    "the minus sign in the definition is due to concavity of the entropy function .",
    "interpretations of the geometries associated with the metric are discussed in @xcite plus references therein .",
    "it has been argued that the curvature scalar of the ruppeiner metric measures the complexity of the underlying interactions of the system , the metric is flat for the ideal gas whereas it has curvature singularities for the van der waals gas .",
    "we take note that most interesting ruppeiner metrics that we encounter have curvature singularities which are physically suggestive , but there are some known flat ruppeiner metrics that can be understood from a mathematical point of view we proved in man @xcite a flatness theorem which states that riemann curvature tensor constructed out of the negative of the hessian of the entropy of the form @xmath4 will vanish , where @xmath5 is an arbitrary analytic function and @xmath6 .",
    "the latter condition is necessary in order for the metric to be nondegenerate .",
    "this theorem has proven useful in our work on the dilaton bhs @xcite as it allows us to see the local geometry already by glancing at the entropy function .",
    "we also note that the signature of the ruppeiner metric corresponds to the sign of the system s specific heat , the signature is lorentzian for system with negative specific heat and euclidean when all specific heats are positive .",
    "we have observed that the ruppeiner curvature scalar diverges in the extremal limits of the kerr , mp and reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) ads bh whilst it is vanishing for rn , btz and dilaton bhs @xcite . despite the flat thermodynamic geometry one can extract useful information on the bh solutions by plotting the state space of such the flat geometry .",
    "normally it is done by first transforming the metric into a manifestly flat form and then bringing it into a recognizably minskowskian form .",
    "[ fig1 ]    incidentally there is a so - called _ poincar _ s linear series method for analyzing stability in non - extensive systems .",
    "the simplicity of this method is owing to the fact that it utilizes only a few thermodynamic functions such as the fundamental relations in order to study / analyze ( in)stabilities .",
    "this method can thus be applied to bhs although they are non - extensive systems .",
    "non - extensitivity in bhs is due to self - gravitation and furthermore the bhs can not be subdivided and the bh entropy scales with area instead of the volume . for the analysis we use the recipes given in @xcite without further elaboration . in the poincar method one",
    "plots a conjugacy diagram an inverse temperature versus mass and we can infer some information about the existence of instability if the turning point is present ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in higher dimensions bhs are more interesting objects due to richer rotation dynamics , and the appearance of extended black objects such as black strings . for more detailed and complete information",
    ". the higher - dimensional generalization of the 4d bhs is the myers - perry bhs . in 5d",
    "there is a black ring solution @xcite which is a bh with a horizon topology @xmath7 in asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "black strings and black branes suffer from instabilities known as the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite .",
    "the mp black holes with only one angular momentum turned on when spinning ultrafast also suffer from instabilities .",
    "the ruppeiner curvature scalar  @xcite for the mp bh with one spin is singular at @xmath8 which coincides with that found by emparan and myers in @xcite but in different coordinates and the bh temperature reaches its minimum at this point .",
    "this is where the mp bh starts behaving like black membrane ( which is an unstable object ) but the instability is believed to set in somewhat later when the mass of the system decreases plus that there are unstable dynamical modes due to metric perturbations which the poincar method does not see such as those recently investigated ( in various dimensions ) by dias in @xcite .",
    "attempts to analyze such the instabilities by means of thermodynamic geometry are being made in @xcite .",
    "the weinhold metric for the mp bh is flat and can be brought into a manifestly flat form by coordinate transformations .",
    "the state space of the mp bhs appears as a wedge embedded in a minkowski space and we call this diagram a _ thermodynamic cone_. as mentioned above one can obtain some information from the thermodynamic cone the bh entropy is vanishing on the light cone whereas the edge of the wedge is where @xmath9 which is the bh s extremal limit .",
    "the opening angle is unique for each bh and it increases as the number of dimensions increases . as we increase the number of dimensions the opening angle tends to the right angle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .          in @xcite",
    "the authors show that the method of thermodynamic geometry is consistent with the poincar stability analysis , and they are able to prove that one of the black ring branches is always locally unstable , showing that there is a change of stability at the point where the two black ring branches meet .",
    "their results using two different methods ( ruppeiner and poincar ) are consistent with each other .",
    "information geometry is a new approach for studying bh thermodynamics and possibly bh instabilities .",
    "this approach opens up new perspectives and sheds light on critical phenomena in bh systems .",
    "the signature of the thermodynamic metric and the curvature singularities correspond to the sign of the specific heat and the extremal limit of the bhs respectively .",
    "the curvature singularity is physically suggestive in that it signals the initial onset of instability in higher dimensional bhs .",
    "this method has so far been consistent with the poincar analysis .",
    "geometrical patterns of bh thermodynamics uncovered may play an important role in the context of quantum gravity .",
    "np would like to acknowledge the organizers of the ere2009 in bilbao for their kind support , and he would also like to thank roberto emparan for useful discussions .",
    "np and j thank ingemar bengtsson on various comments .",
    "finally np warmly thanks the kof group and department of physics , stockholm university for the kind hospitality ."
