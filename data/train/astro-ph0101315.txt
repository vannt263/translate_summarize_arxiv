    "an ultra high energy neutrino can interact via a charge current interaction , giving most of its energy to the secondary electron , which can then initiate an electromagnetic cascade or shower .",
    "askaryan @xcite predicted a negative charge imbalance in the cascade which gives rise to coherent cherenkov radiation at radio frequencies .",
    "the predicted flux of ultra high energy neutrinos is small and model dependent @xcite .",
    "an experiment to detect ultra high energy neutrinos using radio antennas requires a large volume because of the small flux .",
    "a dense , radio - transparent target is needed for the small shower size needed for coherence and small signal attenuaton .",
    "antarctic ice is suitable for this purpose .",
    "a detailed analysis of such an experiment was done @xcite which concluded that a modest array of antennas can detect many events per year .",
    "the radio ice cherenkov experiment ( rice ) at the south pole @xcite is a prototype designed to detect neutrinos with energy @xmath0 using this method .",
    "a reliable monte carlo simulation tool is needed to study the shower development , cherenkov radiation , detector , and data acquisiton system .",
    "one can also test the idea of coherent cherenkov emission at accelerator facilities by dumping bunches of electrons or photons in a dense target like sand or salt or any other suitable medium @xcite .",
    "zas , halzen and stanev ( zhs ) @xcite developed a monte carlo simulation to study electromagnetic showers and cherenkov emission in ice .",
    "buniy and ralston @xcite have also developed a method to estimate the coherent cherenkov signal by parametrizing the cascades .",
    "we have developed a geant monte carlo simulation primarily to study the coherent cherenkov emmission in ice but it can easily be modified for other similar studies with different materials .",
    "geant @xcite is a well known and widely used detector simulation package in particle physics .",
    "it allows access to all details of the simulation such as controls of various processes , definition of target and detector media , and a complete history of all events simulated .",
    "it can be used to simulate all dominant processes in the @xmath1 energy range .",
    "cross sections of electromagnetic processes are reproduced in geant within a few percent up to a hundred @xmath2 .",
    "we use geant to simulate electromagnetic cascades inside materials from which we extract track information .",
    "we take this track information and determine the resulting radio pulse using standard electrodynamics calculations .",
    "we also calculate other shower parameters using the track and energy information from geant .",
    "when a high energy electron ( @xmath3 ) or photon ( @xmath4 ) hits a material target , an electromagnetic cascade is created inside the material . _ bremmstrahlung _ and _ pair production _ are the dominant high energy processes at the beginning of the shower development . due to bremmstrahlung",
    ", an @xmath3 loses @xmath5 of it s energy on average over a distance @xmath6 , the _ radiation length_. the secondary @xmath4 can then produce an @xmath7 pair .",
    "the number of particles thus grows exponentially .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath8 lose energy due to _ ionization _ as they travel inside the material . after reaching a _ critical energy_(@xmath9 ) , when the energy loss due to bremmstrahlung is equal the energy loss due to ionization , @xmath3 , @xmath8 lose their energy mostly due to ionization and the cascade eventually stops .",
    "a rough estimate of the critical energy is @xmath10 which can be obtained by equating the radiation and the ionization loss formulae .",
    "@xmath11 is the atomic number of the medium .",
    "all models of an electromagnetic cascade , including a simplified model developed by heitler @xcite , and a more realistic model developed by carlson and oppenheimer @xcite , show similar basic features which include linear scaling of the track lengths and logarithmic scaling of the maximum position with primary energy .",
    "the cascade is concentrated near an axis along the direction of the primary . _",
    "multiple couloumb scattering _ is responsible for the transverse spread of the cascade . a quantity called",
    "_ moliere radius _ ( @xmath12 ) is determined by the average angular deflection per radiation length at the critical energy ( @xmath9 ) and is used to estimate the transverse spread .",
    "one can also look at the fraction of energy that escapes transverse to the shower axis @xcite to get a good estimate of @xmath12 . about @xmath13 of the primary energy",
    "is contained inside a tube of radius @xmath12 along the shower axis . a relationship between the moliere radius , the critical energy and",
    "the radiation length is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scale energy .",
    "low energy processes like _ compton _ , _ moller _ and _ bhabha _ scatterings and _ positron annihilation _ build up a net charge ( more @xmath3 than @xmath8 ) in the cascade , as atomic electrons in the target medium are swept up into the forward moving shower .",
    "high energy @xmath3 and @xmath8 in the cascade can travel faster than the speed of light in the medium and give rise to cherenkov radiation .",
    "the electric field due to a single charge moving uniformly from position @xmath16 to @xmath17 in the _ fraunhoffer _ limit , is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relative permeability and @xmath20 is the refractive index of the medium . the condition @xmath21 defines the cherenkov angle @xmath22 as @xmath23 . at or very close to the cherenkov angle or at low frequency ,",
    "the equation ( [ eq : pulse2 ] ) can be reduced to the form @xmath24 see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] for a description of various quantities in equations ( [ eq : pulse2 ] , [ eq : pulse3 ] ) .",
    "since on average , the electrons lose @xmath5 of their energy in each radiation length due to bremmstrahlung , one can fit an exponential to the energy loss data generated by the monte carlo and find a value for the radiation length ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this will serve as an internal consistency check to ensure that we are tracking all the particles along with their energies .",
    "we generated @xmath25 showers of @xmath26 electrons and recorded the energy loss due to bremsstrahlung .",
    "a fit to this gives a radiation length of @xmath27 .",
    "given the molecular composition , geant also calculates the medium s radiation length . for ice",
    "it is @xmath28 , which is in agreement with the value we calculated .",

    "we add the energy ( @xmath45 ) , of all the tracks that leave the cylinder without re - entering . by varying the radius of the cylinder we arrive at @xmath12 which is the radius of the cylinder when the fraction @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the initial energy of the cascade .",
    "we have checked @xmath12 for lead , iron and ice ( see table i ) .",
    "one can also calculate the critical energy ( @xmath9 ) using two different formulae quoted earlier .",
    "shower depth ( @xmath49 ) is measured in units of radiation length ( @xmath6 ) as @xmath50 .",
    "we have simulated @xmath51 electron - induced cascades in iron .",
    "the longitudinal profile was obtained by adding the number of particles with total energy greater than @xmath52 crossing planes at every half radiation length perpendicular to the shower axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iron]a .",
    "the number of particles agrees reasonably with egs4 simulation of the same shower @xcite .",
    "the greisen - rossi distribution for total number of particles ( electrons and positrons ) is shown by the dashed line .",
    "a least squares fit to the geant data with greisen - rossi distribution gives about @xmath13 confidence level .",
    "we used the same method to study the longitudinal profile of showers in ice .",
    "simulation shows the correct scaling behavior of the number of particles with the initial energy of the shower .",
    "the position of the shower maximum also shows the correct logarithmic scaling with the initial energy .",
    "the charge excess ( @xmath53 ) is defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the number of electrons and positrons respectively as functions of shower depth . according to our simulations ,",
    "the net charge imbalance is @xmath57 at the shower max .",
    "note that there is no direct experimental data on this .    a comparison of @xmath58 shower ( averaged over 20 showers ) with @xmath59 threshold from geant to the same from zhs monte carlo ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iron]b ) shows about a @xmath60 discrepancy for the total number of particles at the shower max .",
    "the discrepancy between the two simulations remains the same at higher energies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] , we show the charge excess in a @xmath61 shower from geant with kinetic energy threshold @xmath52 .",
    "this is an average of @xmath62 showers and the charge excess is broken down to different energy bins .",
    "it shows that most of the contributions to charge excess come from the energy range @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "the cherenkov pulse from a cascade is proportional to the total track length ( energy deposition ) of the cascade .",
    "our results show the correct scaling behavior of the track lengths with the initial energy ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "if we consider all processes to be elastic except ionization , then an upper bound for the total track length is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the average ionization energy loss per unit length . to determine ( @xmath68 ) we generated @xmath25 of @xmath69 tracks and kept a record of the rate at which energy was lost due to ionization .",
    "fig.[fig : pul]a shows the average ( @xmath68 ) for the @xmath25 tracks .",
    "it can be seen that the average value matches theoretical bethe - bloch result reasonably well .",
    "the average ionization loss in the relativistic rise region is approximately @xmath70 .",
    "to calculate the electric pulse from the cascade , we added up the contributions ( [ eq : pulse2 ] ) from all charged tracks .",
    "there are two assumptions we made to evaluate pulse ( [ eq : pulse2 ] ) and ( [ eq : pulse3 ] ) from geant track information .",
    "first , we assume an azimuthal symmetry about the shower axis , which allows us to evaluate pulse equations in 2-dimensions .",
    "this is a good approximation as long as we have many tracks in the shower .",
    "a typical @xmath61 shower has thousands of tracks and the number goes up as we increase the energy .",
    "we checked this approximation on a shower - by - shower basis and did not find any noticeable difference between the pulses evaluated in the @xmath71 plane and in the @xmath72 plane ( @xmath73 - is the shower axis ) .",
    "second , we evaluate the times @xmath74 and @xmath75 in ( [ eq : pulse2 ] ) and ( [ eq : pulse3 ] ) assuming that the particles travel at the speed of light .",
    "this is a good approximation if the frequency is not too high as can be seen from ( [ eq : pulse2 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pul]b , we calculate pulses ) and ( [ eq : pulse3 ] ) by @xmath76 from @xmath77 and @xmath61 showers at @xmath78 and @xmath79 frequencies .",
    "the pulse height at the cherenkov peak ( @xmath80 ) scales with the energy of the shower , and the gaussian half width is inversely proportional to the frequency which is analogous to a slit diffraction pattern .",
    "we find distinctive , coherent , cherenkov radio frequency emission from simulated electromagnetic cascades in ice with energies in the @xmath58 to @xmath77 range .",
    "the multi - purpose , detector simulation package geant provides a suitable modelleing of electromagnetic shower details for this purpose , with the flexibility to include hadronic cascades in future studies .",
    "this work also serves as an independent treatment of the problem , which has been studied previously @xcite .",
    "the geant generated showers are qualitatively in agreement with those in @xcite .",
    "the showers differ in several details ; however our far - field calculation of the pulse from a shower gives the same result up to a @xmath81 frequency as that of @xcite when both are applied to the same shower simulation .",
    "this has been checked explicitly by calculating the field using our field code and the track informtions from zhs code with the direct field output from zhs code for the same shower .",
    "the differences between a geant and a zhs shower of initial energy @xmath58 is summarized in table ii .",
    "the origin of differences between the two monte carlos is under study .",
    "our direct calculation of moliere radius , critical energy and shower population as a function of shower depth using geant all agree within a few percent with measurements or with published egs4 simulations for iron and lead @xcite .",
    "the extension to ice is straightforward and we expect the same level of reliability here .",
    "our results agree with the theoretically expected @xcite linear scaling of number of particles at shower maximum and logarithimic scaling of depth at shower maximum with energy .",
    "these are not straightforward results , since the theoretical predictions are based on inclusion of bremmstrahlung and pair production only , while the physics at the shower maximum is not dominated by these processes .",
    "it includes important contributions from compton , bhabha and moller processes as well , which give rise to charge imbalance and , consequently , coherent radio cherenkov field emission .",
