    "<S> recent electronic structure calculations for the title compounds performed by wu et .  _ al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are critically reconsidered , applying high precision full - potential bandstructure methods . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the bandstructure calculations presented by the authors contain several important inconsistencies , which make their main conclusions highly questionable .    in a recent paper wu et .  _ </S>",
    "<S> al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite presented bandstructure calculations for the quasi one - dimensional cuo - chain compound srcuo@xmath0 and the quasi two - dimensional material cacuo@xmath0 , both being of prototypical character and therefore of general interest . </S>",
    "<S> wu et .  </S>",
    "<S> _ al . _  </S>",
    "<S> used a full - potential linear combination of atomic orbitals method @xcite in the framework of the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and included on - site coulomb interaction corrections ( lsda+@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite claim that on the basis of their full - potential band structure experimental findings can be well fit with an @xmath1 of 5 ev , significantly smaller than @xmath1 values reported in previous calculations  @xcite .    however , there are obvious inconsistencies and important differences between the calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and previous studies @xcite , concerning ( i ) the proper symmetry in @xmath2-space , ( ii ) the widths and the orbital character of the shown bands , ( iii ) the total ( dos ) as well as the partial densities of states ( pdos ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we reinvestigated the electronic structures of cacuo@xmath0 and srcuo@xmath0 using two independent , well basis converged full - potential bandstructure methods to find out whether or not the differences mentioned above could be understood as a consequence of the differences between a full - potential @xcite and the earlier non - full - potential calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out lsda bandstructure calculations for cacuo@xmath0 within a full - potential minimum - basis local - orbital scheme ( fplo ) @xcite and within a full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) scheme @xcite , both in scalar relativistic versions . </S>",
    "<S> ( we note that relativistic effects are in the order of 0.1 ev only . ) in the fplo - scheme , modified ca 3@xmath3 , 4@xmath4 , 4@xmath5 , ( sr 5@xmath4 , 5@xmath5 , 4@xmath3 ) , cu 3@xmath3 , 4@xmath4 , 4@xmath5 , and o 2@xmath4 , 2@xmath5 , 3@xmath3 states were used as valence states for cacuo@xmath0 ( srcuo@xmath0 ) , the lower lying states were treated as core states . </S>",
    "<S> the wien97-code @xcite employs local orbitals ( lo ) to relax linearisation errors and to treat the o-2s and semicore cu-3p and ca-3s , 3p states . </S>",
    "<S> well converged basis sets of over 500 apw functions plus los were used . </S>",
    "<S> the radii of the atomic spheres in the latter case were 1.8 a.u .  </S>",
    "<S> for all atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the basic calculations were performed with 125 and 90 @xmath2-points in the fplo - scheme and in the wien97-code , respectively , for the irreducible part of the brillouin zone using the tetrahedron method . </S>",
    "<S> we itasize that the numerical convergence ( with respect to the number of @xmath2-points @xmath6 , the valence basis set , the potential and the density representataion ) of all calculated properties was carefully checked . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we will discuss first cacuo@xmath0 and afterwards srcuo@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we will concentrate on the bandstructure and then on the dos . </S>",
    "<S> both bandstructures obtained with the fplo and wien97 codes agree excellently with each other ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) and with previously published results @xcite . considering the bands in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one realizes the following points : the authors show a bandstructure with _ orthorhombic _ symmetry for the _ tetragonal _ crystal structure @xcite ( note the different dispersions in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite along the @xmath7-(100 ) and @xmath7-(010 ) direction , respectively , which must be equivalent for the tetragonal case ) . also , the band degeneracies at symmetry points are incorrect . as a consequence , the number of degeneracies in @xmath7-(001 ) direction ( @xmath8-direction ) differs from all other calculations ( 11 different bands instead of 8 different bands allowed by the crystal symmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to our results and to the results of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the authors find an additional , third band with sizable dispersion with its maximum at ( 001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the orbital character of our bands , in particular to find out which states are responsible for the relatively large dispersion in @xmath8-direction of about 1 - 2 ev discussed also by mattheiss et _ al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that these two strongly dispersive bands have predominant o 2@xmath9 character with a small admixture of cu 3@xmath10 states . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath8-dispersion of the antibonding band essentially made up by o 2@xmath5-@xmath11 and o 2@xmath5-@xmath12 orbitals with the cu 3@xmath13 orbital is only about 350 mev . </S>",
    "<S> just these states mediate the magnetic coupling between different layers . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the quasi two - dimensional character of the magnetic hamiltonian .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) we compare our results for the dos with those of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the width of their @xmath14-complex is too large by about 2 ev . the authors attribute this discrepancy to their choice of an ionic basis , which only means that their calculations are not basis set converged . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the large discrepancy between the dos of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and our s is evident from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) and 1(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> due to the ionic orbital basis used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the o 2@xmath5 states are shifted downwards by about 2 ev and the hybridisation with cu 3@xmath3 states is consequently reduced . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute simply the reduction of the bandwidth in the lsda+@xmath1 in the calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to a downwards shift of their cu 3@xmath3 states towards the incorrectly positioned oxygen 2@xmath5 states .    for our paramagnetic calculation </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dos is in excellent agreement with the dos reported in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that the occurrence of van - hove singularities at the band edges of the antibonding band , due to the nearly one - dimensional electronic structure of the compound , depends critically on the sufficiently large @xmath6 used in the calculation .    for the supercell calculation , we doubled the unit cell along the chain direction and started the self - consistent calculation with an antiferromagnetic arrangement of the cu spins along the chains @xcite . to describe properly some peculiarities </S>",
    "<S> related to the nearly one - dimensional electronic structure , we made several calculations varying @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we enlarged @xmath6 along the chain direction . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  2 . due to the nearly ideal one - dimensional dispersion of srcuo@xmath0 , the calculation results in an erroneous insulating groundstate for an _ insufficient _ @xmath6 . at least for @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> the artificial gap and the related singularities disappear and the results converge towards those of our paramagnetic calculation . </S>",
    "<S> possibly , the gap of 0.55 ev in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can be attributed qualitatively to an insufficient number of @xmath2-points . </S>",
    "<S> the reported relatively big magnetic moment of 0.33 @xmath16 is related to this artificial gap and to the unusualy small hybridisation of the cu 3@xmath3 states with the o 2@xmath5 states . </S>",
    "<S> an antiferromagnetic solution has been reported also by other authors @xcite though with an even much smaller gap and extremely small magnetic moments for the srcuo@xmath0-system . </S>",
    "<S> again , we attribute this gap ( notably smaller than that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite due to a larger @xmath6 ) to a still too small number of @xmath2-points .    to make this point more clear let us consider schematically the band structure in the folded zone picture in @xmath17 - ( 001 ) direction near the antiferromagnetic bragg point ( see fig .  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the weak hybridisation between the two subchains of the double chain leads to two slightly split bands . </S>",
    "<S> after the folding of these two bands in the doubled unit cell , new crossing points appear close to the new symmetry plane . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , dos routines result in a wrong interpolation if the crossing points are not at calculated @xmath2-points . </S>",
    "<S> the mentioned above splitting @xmath18 @xmath19 150 mev ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) provides an upper bound for the artificial gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for supercell calculations , especially for quasi one - dimensional electronic structures , one has to be very careful choosing @xmath6 in applying standard interpolation methods .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one finds the cu 3@xmath3 states in the pdos with a too small width as already discussed for cacuo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for an orbital projected dos , it is reasonable to use symmetry related orbitals with their quantization axis perpendicular to the cuo@xmath20 plaquette . in this representation </S>",
    "<S> only the cu 3@xmath13 orbital contributes considerably to the antibonding band ( instead of two cu 3@xmath3 orbitals shown in fig .  4 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , as found for cacuo@xmath0 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . the lsda+@xmath1 procedure used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite depends on the basis set representation and would require therefore the application of the same local orbital symmetry for both compounds in order to ensure a proper comparison between them .    to summarize , we discussed the main differences between the results of wu et _ al . _ </S>",
    "<S> and our / or previously published data @xcite basic paramagnetic lda calculations contain several serious inconsistencies , all conclusions reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with respect to lsda+@xmath1 are highly questionable . in particular , the large gap in srcuo@xmath0 at moderate @xmath1 might result from the artificial gap found in their lsda calculations .    * acknowledgment : * support for h.r . and </S>",
