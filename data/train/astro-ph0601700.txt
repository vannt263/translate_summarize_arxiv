    "the above values may follow the @xmath72 relation for elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the excess flux may be attributed to hot ism emission from the central galaxy",
    ". however , the x - ray temperature inferred from the hardness ratio is @xmath73  kev assuming a @xmath74 mekal model .",
    "this is marginally high for a typical elliptical galaxy .",
    "thus we might be looking at a superposition of the galaxy component and central emission from the cluster . given the present photon statistics , however , it is not possible to constrain further the origin of the emission .",
    "note that the total x - ray luminosity of unresolved low - mass x - ray binaries is expected to be of the order @xmath75 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and contributes only @xmath76% to the excess luminosity .",
    "x - ray emission from the central fifth image @xcite is unlikely : the contribution is estimated to be only @xmath77 counts ( i.e. , about @xmath78% of the central @xmath66 emission ) assuming that the x - ray emission from the fifth image has similar intensity ratios as those measured in the hst acs image .",
    "the observed profile may be better fitted by introducing the two - component @xmath46-models or increasing the inner slope parameter @xmath3 in the nfw - ssm model ; however , we will not pursue this process further since the above two models already provided acceptable fits to the data .",
    "a considerably deeper observation is needed to constrain further the gas profile in the innermost region .    from the image analysis ,",
    "the extent of the x - ray emission above the 3-@xmath63 background level is found to be @xmath79 ( figure  [ sb ] ) , which is close to an overdensity radius of @xmath80  mpc .      under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", we can infer the mass distribution of the lensing cluster from the x - ray temperature and surface - brightness profiles . because there is not a significant radial dependence of the x - ray temperature in the observations",
    ", we assume isothermality of the gas in the mass estimation . figure  [ fig : mx ] shows the cylindrical cluster mass projected within a radius @xmath81 derived from each surface mass distribution profile .",
    "we find that both models yield consistent mass profiles within the measurement errors .",
    "it is interesting to compare the mass derived from x - ray analysis with that from gravitational lensing .",
    "@xcite derived the cylindrical mass to be @xmath82 , and @xcite estimated @xmath83 . from figure",
    "[ fig : mx ] , it is clear that both mass estimations are in excellent agreement with the mass profile from the x - ray observation .",
    "for instance , we find the cylindrical masses within 100  kpc for the @xmath46-model and nfw - ssm model are @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy between x - ray and lensing masses has been reported in many lensing clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is often ascribed to the projection of the extra matter along line - of - sight , the elongation of the lensing cluster along the line - of - sight direction , or a departure from equilibrium . the excellent agreement between x - ray and lensing masses",
    "implies that none of these effects is significant for sdss  j1004 + 4112 .    for the nfw - ssm model and @xmath86 @xcite ,",
    "the virial mass and the concentration parameter are constrained to be @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the value of the concentration parameter is slightly larger than the theoretically expected median value for this virial mass and redshift , @xmath89 @xcite , but is within 2-@xmath63 scatter among different clusters .",
    "the observed source counts for the four images , a  d , are 1237 , 1580 , 1312 , and 763 , in the 0.57  kev band , respectively .",
    "light curves were produced with time resolutions of 2048 or 4096 sec .",
    "we did not find any clear sign of time variability within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "note that each component was extracted using a circular region with a radius of @xmath90 in the analysis presented in this section .",
    "the sum of the background and contamination from the cluster emission are estimated to be only @xmath91% of the source counts for a  c , and @xmath92% for d , and are negligibly small compared to the statistical errors of the source spectra .",
    "we measure the energy fluxes of lensed images in the _ chandra _ data by fitting each spectrum with a power - law plus gaussian line model ( see the next subsection for details ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : flux ] . the x - ray flux ratios differ significantly from those measured in the optical @xcite . since for fold lenses such as sdss  j1004 + 4112 , the two images near the critical curve are usually brighter than the other two images and since the optical flux ratios were reproduced with simple mass models @xcite , we believe that the x - ray , rather than the optical , ratios are `` anomalous '' . the optical / x - ray flux ratios of images c and d are almost the same , therefore the most natural interpretation is that the image a is demagnified by a factor of @xmath93 in x - rays .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the observation that image a appears to be a saddle - point image @xcite which is more likely to be demagnified by perturbations than the other images @xcite . while the optical data compared in table  [ tab : flux ] were taken on 2004 april 28 @xcite , the demagnification of image a in x - rays is further supported by optical observations on 2004 november 27 and 2005 april 26 with the magnum telescope @xcite . by linearly interpolating these two @xmath94-band imaging observations ,",
    "we infer optical flux ratios on 2005 january 1 to be b / a=0.69 , c / a=0.40 , and d / a=0.29 , which are not very different from those listed in table  [ tab : flux ] .    in table  [ tab : flux ] , we also show the values of @xmath30 to check the consistency of the x - ray and optical fluxes .",
    "the values are somewhat higher than the @xmath95 that is expected from the uv luminosity of sdss  j1004 + 4112 , @xmath96}$ ] ( assuming a magnification factor of @xmath97 for image a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the best - fit @xmath30-uv luminosity relation @xcite . from table  5 of @xcite , @xmath30 is @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "thus the derived @xmath30 is within the 1-@xmath63 ( 2-@xmath63 ) scatter for a ( b  d ) .",
    "the spectrum of the lensed quasar component is displayed in figure  [ fig : qso ] . to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio , the total spectrum ( sum of the images a",
    ", b , c , and d ) is plotted .",
    "we fit the spectrum with a power - law model .",
    "again , the galactic hydrogen column density is fixed to @xmath102 since we did not find significant intrinsic absorption .",
    "this model is rejected at the 90% confidence level ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we plot the residual of the data against the best - fit model in figure  [ sb]a , which shows @xmath104 excesses in adjacent bins around 2.3  kev in our frame .",
    "then we mask these bins and those to either side ( 9 bins from 2.262.66 kev ) and fit a power - law model .",
    "the chi - square becomes significantly smaller ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the above results suggest the presence of an emission line component at @xmath106  kev .",
    "we then fit the spectrum with a power - law plus gaussian line profile model ( see figure  [ fig : qso]b ) . in comparison to just a power - law model ,",
    "the fit was improved at the @xmath107% confidence level according to the @xmath108-test ( @xmath109 for three additional parameters ) .",
    "the fitting yields the power - law index @xmath110 , the centroid energy of the line @xmath111  kev , and the gaussian width of the line @xmath112  ev .",
    "the line centroid is consistent with the neutral iron k@xmath3 line at 6.4  kev in the quasar rest frame and the derived @xmath63 suggests that the line is intrinsically broad . from the result , we can compute the equivalent width @xmath113  ev in the quasar rest frame .",
    "the luminosity is @xmath114 in the 210  kev band . in the case of @xmath97 for the image a , though the lens models that are consistent with the data allow a wide range of @xmath115 @xcite , the intrinsic quasar luminosity is estimated to be @xmath116 ( 210  kev ) .",
    "this is within the luminosity range of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reduced chi - square of the best fit model is @xmath117 .",
    "there is a well - known negative correlation between the strength of the iron line and the x - ray luminosity in quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the derived equivalent width is larger by a factor of @xmath93 than that expected from the relation of @xcite and a factor of @xmath118 than that from recent _ xmm - newton _ observations @xcite .",
    "combined with the result in  [ sec : xrayflux ] , we speculate that microlensing demagnifies the x - ray continuum of image a , while keeping ( or amplifying ) the fe k@xmath3 line .",
    "moreover , microlensing of emission lines in the optical band has been detected for this lens system @xcite , providing additional evidence for the microlensing hypothesis .",
    "the relative enhancement of fe k@xmath3 line has often been observed in the x - ray emission of lensed quasars @xcite , and interpreted in terms of microlensing .",
    "indeed , the relative enhancement of fe k@xmath3 line can be reproduced if the emission is separated in two regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the strong fe k@xmath3 line is further explored by analyzing the spectrum of each image , rather than the sum of all images . to measure the line intensities ,",
    "we fit them with the power - law plus gaussian model . the centroid energy and the width of the line as well as the power - law index",
    "are allowed to vary in the fit .",
    "the best - fit parameters and the 90% errors are listed in table  [ tab : specfit ] .",
    "we found that the spectral parameters for the four images agree with each other at the 95% confidence level , although the parameters , particularly the line width , show large uncertainties .",
    "the fitting results are also statistically consistent with those derived for the total spectrum .",
    "we then performed spectral fitting with @xmath119 , @xmath63 and @xmath120 fixed to the best - fit values for the total spectrum ( figure  [ fig:4spec ] ) and calculated the equivalent widths ( table  [ tab : flux ] ) .",
    "although the errors are very large , the fe k@xmath3 line is detected most significantly for image a , supporting the interpretation above .",
    "we also find that the hardness ratios of the images are marginally consistent with each other ( see table  [ tab : flux ] ) .",
    "@xcite recently proposed that spectral differences between lensed quasar image components are due to small line - of - sight differences through quasar disk wind outflows .",
    "in particular , the author suggested that sdss  j1004 + 4112 components b - d suffer from absorption in a disk - wind outflow and that the blue enhancements in sdss  j1004 + 4112 a @xcite could be due to the alleviation of absorption along that sightline .",
    "indeed , the a - b diffference spectrum from keck / lris spectroscopy of c iv region @xcite resembles that of the troughs seen in a broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar .",
    "however , the observed line profiles and transitions involved ( e.g. , he ii ) mean that these features more plausibly result from excess _ emission _ in component a rather than absorption in component b. in addition , quasars with intrinsic uv absorption ( e.g. , bal troughs ) are generally x - ray faint due to a large intrinsic x - ray absorption ( @xmath121;e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , intrinsic absorption was not significantly detected in the x - ray spectra of the four images ; the 90% upper limit on the column density is obtained to be @xmath122 , and @xmath123 for a  d , respectively .",
    "here we assumed neutral absorbing material at @xmath5 . in the case",
    "that the absorber is highly ionized and has high velocity flow , as proposed by @xcite , x - ray spectra with considerably better statistics are required to test the model .",
    "moreover , if the differential absorption is responsible for the different x - ray spectra of a and b , we expect ( and @xcite predicts ) that the image a should be less absorbed in the x - ray . instead , however , component a has the smallest x - ray to optical flux ratio and the x - ray flux ratio is @xmath124 ( the 1-@xmath63 error ; see table  [ tab : flux ] ) .",
    "thus , given multiple independent indications , we conclude that the microlensing phenomenon is the most natural interpretation for the present data .",
    "we have presented results from _ chandra _ observations of sdss j1004 + 4112 , a large - separation gravitational lens system created by a cluster of galaxies .",
    "we have detected x - ray emission from the lensing cluster as well as four lensed quasar images .    from the cluster x - ray emission",
    ", we have constrained the bolometric luminosity and the temperature to be @xmath125 and @xmath39  kev , consistent with the luminosity - temperature relation of distant clusters .",
    "we have reconstructed the mass profile of the lensing cluster assuming isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium , and found that the mass within 100  kpc excellently agrees with that expected from strong lensing .",
    "x - ray emission from the lensed quasar images displays two anomalies : the presence of a strong fe k@xmath3 line and significant differences in the flux ratios from those found in the optical band . both of these features are suggestive of microlensing .",
