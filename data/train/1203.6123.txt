    "this paper will present an overview of some recent developments in the application of random matrix analysis to the _ topological combinatorics _ of surfaces .",

    "a map is an embedding of a graph into a compact , oriented and connected surface @xmath0 with the requirement that the complement of the graph in @xmath0 should be a disjoint union of simply connected open sets .",
    "if the genus of @xmath0 is @xmath1 , this object is referred to as a _ g - map_. the notion of @xmath1-maps was introduced by tutte and his collaborators in the 60s @xcite as part of their investigations of the four color conjecture .    in the early 80s bessis , itzykson and zuber ,",
    "a group of physicists studying t hooft s diagrammatic approaches to large n expansions in quantum field theory , discovered a profound connection between the problem of enumerating @xmath1-maps and random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "that seminal work was the basis for bringing asymptotic analytical methods into the study of maps and other related combinatorial problems .",
    "subsequently , in the early 90s , other physicists @xcite realized that the matrix model diagrammatics described in @xcite provide a natural means for discretizing the einstein - hilbert action in two dimensions . from that and a formal double scaling limit",
    ", they were able to put forward a candidate for so - called _",
    "2d quantum gravity_. this generated a great deal of interest in the emerging field of string theory .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a systematic review of this activity and to @xcite for a description of more recent developments related to topological string theory .",
    "all of these applications were based on the postulated existence of a @xmath2 asymptotic expansion of the free energy associated to the random matrix partition function , where @xmath3 denotes the size of the matrix , as @xmath3 becomes large .",
    "the combinatorial significance of this expansion is that the coefficient of @xmath4 should be the generating function for the enumeration of @xmath1-maps ( ordered by the cardinality of the map s vertices ) .",
    "in @xcite the existence of this asymptotic expansion and several of its important analytical properties were rigorously established .",
    "this analysis was based on a riemann - hilbert problem originally introduced by fokas , its and kitaev @xcite to study the 2d gravity problem .",
    "the aim of this paper is to outline how the results of @xcite and its sequel @xcite have been used to gain new insights into the map enumeration problem . in particular",
    ", we will be able to prove and significantly extend a conjecture made in @xcite about the closed form structure of the generating functions for map enumeration .    over time combinatorialists",
    "have made novel use of many tools from analysis including contour integrals and differential equations . in this work",
    "we also introduce nonlinear partial diferential equations , in particular a hierarchy of conservation laws reminiscent of the _ shallow water wave equations _",
    "@xcite ( see ( [ toda ] ) ) .",
    "this appears to make contact with the class of _ differential posets _ introduced by stanley @xcite ( see remark [ diffposet ] ) .",
    "the general class of matrix ensembles we analyze has probability measures of the form @xmath5\\right\\ } dm,\\,\\ , \\mbox{where}\\\\ \\label{i.001b } v_j(\\lambda ; \\ t_{j } ) & = &   \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda^{2 } +   \\frac{t_{j}}{j } \\lambda^{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defined on the space @xmath6 of @xmath7 hermitean matrices , @xmath8 , and with @xmath9 a positive parameter , referred to as the _ string coefficient_. the normalization factor @xmath10 , which serves to make @xmath11 a probability measure , is called the _ partition function _ of this unitary ensemble .    in previous treatments , @xcite ,",
    "we have used the parameter @xmath12 instead of @xmath9 . this was in keeping with notational usages in some areas of random matrix theory ; however , since here we are trying to make a connection to some applications in quatum gravity , we have adopted the notation traditionally used in that context .",
    "this also is why we have scaled the time parameter @xmath13 by @xmath14 in this paper .    for general polynomial weights @xmath15 it is possible to establish the following fundamental asymptotic expansion @xcite , @xcite of the logarithm of the _ free energy _",
    "associated to the partition function .",
    "more precisely , those papers consider weights of the form @xmath16 with @xmath17 even .    we introduce a renormalized partition function , which we refer to as a _ tau function _ representation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the principal object of interest is the _",
    "large n _ asymptotic expansion of this representation for which one has the result @xcite    @xmath20    as @xmath21 while @xmath22 with @xmath23 , called the t hooft parameter , held fixed .",
    "moreover , for @xmath24 for some @xmath25 ,    a.   [ unif ] the expansion is uniformly valid on compact subsets of @xmath26 ; b.   [ analyt ] @xmath27 extends to be complex analytic in @xmath28 ; c.   [ diff ] the expansion may be differentiated term by term in @xmath29 with uniform error estimates as in ( [ unif ] )    the meaning of ( [ unif ] ) is that for each @xmath1 there is a constant , @xmath30 , depending only on @xmath26 and @xmath1 such that @xmath31 for @xmath32 in a compact subset of @xmath26 .",
    "the estimates referred to in ( [ diff ] ) have a similar form with @xmath33 and @xmath34 replaced by their mixed derivatives ( the same derivatives in each term ) and with a possibly different set of constants @xmath30 .",
    "recently these results were extended to the case where @xmath17 is odd @xcite . in this case",
    "one should replace the normalized partiiton function ( [ tausquare ] ) by its szeg representation in terms of eignevalues ( [ szego ] ) .",
    "to explain the topological significance of the @xmath35 as generating functions , we begin with a precise definition of the objects they enumerate .",

    "what @xcite effectively showed was that the partial derivatives of @xmath42 evaluated at @xmath43 `` count '' a geometric quotient of a certain class of _ labelled g - maps_.    as a means to reduce from enumerating these labelled @xmath1-maps to enumerating @xmath1-maps , it is natural to try taking a geometric quotient by a `` relabelling group '' more properly referred to as a _ cartographic group _ @xcite .",
    "this labelling has two parts ; first the vertices of the same valence , @xmath44 have an order labelling @xmath45 and second at each vertex one of the edges is distinguished .",
    "given that x is oriented , this second labelling gives a unique ordering of the edges around each vertex .",
    "the fact that the coefficients of the free energy expansion ( [ i.002 ] ) enumerate this class of labelled @xmath1-maps is a consequence of ( [ i.002 ] ) ( i ) which enables one to evaluate a mixed partial derivative of @xmath46 in terms of the _ gaussian unitary ensemble _ ( gue ) where correlation functions of matrix coefficients all reduce to two point functions .",
    "( a precise description of this correspondence may be found in @xcite ) .    to help fix these ideas we consider the case of a @xmath17-regular @xmath1-map ( i.e. , every vertex has the same valence , @xmath17 ) of size @xmath47 ( i.e. , the map has @xmath47 vertices ) which is the main interest of this paper .",
    "the cartographic group in this case is generated by the symmmetric group @xmath48 which permutes the vertex labels and @xmath47 factors of the cyclic group @xmath49 which rotates the distinguished edge at a given vertex in the direction of the holomorphic ( counter - clockwise ) orientation on @xmath0 .",
    "the order of the cartographic group here is the same as that of the product of its factors which is @xmath50 . on the other hand",
    "the generating function for @xmath1-maps in this setting is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 = the number of labelled @xmath17-regular @xmath1-maps on @xmath47 vertices .",
    "the factor @xmath53 perfectly cancels the order of the cartographic group , making this series appear to indeed be the ordinary generating function for pure @xmath1-maps .",
    "however , for some @xmath1-maps the cartographic action may have non - trivial isotropy and this can create an `` over - cancellation '' of the labelling .",
    "this happens when a particular relabelling of a given map can be transformed back to the original labelling by a diffeomorphism of the underlying riemann surface @xmath0 . in this event",
    "the two labellings are indistinguishable and the diffeomorphism induces an automorphism of the underlying map .",
    "in addition , the element of the cartographic group giving rise to this situation is an element of the isotropy group of the given map .",
    "hence , as a generating function for the geometric quotient , ( [ gquoti ] ) is expressible as @xmath54 where @xmath55 = the number of vertices of @xmath36 , @xmath56 = the number of faces of @xmath36 and aut(@xmath36 ) = the automorphism group of the map @xmath36 .",
    "we have included the @xmath57-dependent form , ( [ gquotiii ] ) , of @xmath46 since that will play an important role later on and also to observe that this is in fact a _ bivariate _ generating function for enumerating @xmath1-maps with a fised number of vertices and faces .",
    "moreover , in this @xmath17-regular setting , one sees that the bivariate function is self - similar .",
    "this is a direct consequence of euler s relation : @xmath58 the presence of geometric factors such as @xmath59 is not uncommon in enumerative graph theory , a classical example being that of erds - rnyi graphs @xcite . in the quantum gravity setting these factors also have a natural interpretation in terms of the discretization of the reduction to conformal structures via a quotient of metrics by the action of the diffeomorphism group .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details on this attractive set of ideas .    in @xcite , @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "were explicitly computed for the case of valence @xmath62 .",
    "we quote , from the same paper , the following conjecture ( some notation has been changed to be consistent with ours ) :    _  it would of course be very interesting to obtain @xmath63 in closed form for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "the method of this paper enabled us to do so up to @xmath64 , but works in the general case , although it requires an incresing amount of work .",
    "we conjecture a general expression of the form _ @xmath65 _ with @xmath66 a polynomial in @xmath67 , the degree of which could be obtained by a careful analysis of the above procedure . \" _    here",
    "@xmath68 is equal , up to a scaling , to the generating function for the catalan numbers ; below it will signify @xmath69 which is similarly related to the generating function for the higher catalan numbers ( [ catalan ] ) .    over the years",
    "there have been a number of attempts to systematically address this question by studying the resolvent of the random matrix and associated schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "our methods take a different approach .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show how this conjecture can be verified and significantly extended . in particular",
    ", we will show that for the case of even valence , @xmath70 ,    [ thm51 ] for @xmath71 , @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",

    "our methods can be extended to the case of @xmath17 odd and the derivation of the analogue to theorem [ thm51 ] is in progress ( see section [ sec:6 ] ) .",
    "the route to getting these results passes through nonlinear pde , in particular a class of nonlinear evolution equations known as conservation laws which come from studying scaling limits of the recursion operators for orthogonal polynomials whose weights match those of the matrix models .",
    "this appeal to orthogonal polynomials also motivated the approaches of @xcite and @xcite . however to give a rigorous _ and _ effective treatment to the problem of finding closed form expressions for the coefficients of the asymptotic free energy , ( [ i.002 ] ) , requires essential use of riemann - hilbert analysis on the riemann hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "though we will not review this analysis here , we will state the consequences of it needed for our applications and reference their sources .",
    "in section [ sec:2 ] we present the necessary background on orthogonal polynomials and introduce the main equations governing their recurrences operators : the _ difference string equations _ and the _ toda lattice equations_. in section [ sec:44 ] we describe how ( [ i.002 ] ) can be used to derive and solve ( in the case of even valence ) the continuum limits of these equations which relates to the nonlinear evolution equations alluded to earlier . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we outline the proof theorem [ thm51 ] and in section [ sec:6 ] we describe the extension of this program to the case of odd valence and briefly mention what has been accomplished in that case thus far .",
    "this will also help to illuminate the full picture behind the idea of conservation laws for random matrices .",
    "let us recall the classical relation between orthogonal polynomials and the space of square - integrable functions on the real line , @xmath79 , with respect to exponentially weighted measures .",
    "in particular , we want to focus attention on weights that correspond to the random matrix weights , @xmath80 , ( [ i.001b ] ) with @xmath17 even .",
    "( recently this relation has been extended to the cases of @xmath17 odd @xcite , with the orthogonal polynomials generalised to the class of so - called _ non - hermitean _ orthogonal polynomials ; however , for this exposition we will stick primarily with the even case . ) to that end we consider the hilbert space @xmath81 of weighted square integrable functions .",
    "this space has a natural polynomial basis , @xmath82 , determined by the conditions that @xmath83 for the construction of this basis and related details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "with respect to this basis , the operator of multiplication by @xmath84 is representable as a semi - infinite tri - diagonal matrix , @xmath85 @xmath86 is commonly referred as the _ recursion operator _ for the orthogonal polynomials and its entries as _",
    "( when @xmath15 is an even potential , it follows from symmetry that @xmath87 for all @xmath17 . )",
    "we remark that often a basis of orthonormal , rather than monic orthogonal , polynomials is used to make this representation . in that case",
    "the analogue of ( [ multop ] ) is a symmetric tri - diagonal matrix .",

    "the boundary may be regarded as a curve of critical parameters for this deformation .",
    "this curve is precisely the locus where the riemann invariants , that determine the edge of the spectrum ( as described in [ 71 ] ) exhibit a shock .",
    "this scenario is reminiscent of that for the small @xmath400-limit of the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite in which the analogue of our boundary curve is the envelope of _ dispersive shocks_. in that setting it is the zakharov - shabat inverse scattering problem that shows one how to pass through the dispersive shocks and describe a continuation of measure - valued solutions with so - called _ multi - gap _ support .",
    "it is our expectation that coupling gravity to an appropriate conformal field theory ( to thus arrive at a bona fide string theory ) @xcite will play a similar role in our setting to determine a unique continuation through the boundary curve of critical parameters to a unique equilibrium measure with multi - cut support .",
