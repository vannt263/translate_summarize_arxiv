    "+ the strong - coupling physics of a conformal field theory living on the flat boundary of @xmath0 is mapped by duality to the weak - coupling quantum string theory ( quantum gravity ) in the @xmath10 bulk . this amazing spin - off of string theory connects @xmath11 physics in flat spacetime to quantum gravity in @xmath0 in a beautiful realization of the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "+ in this framework the gravitational dual of the de - confinement phase transition turns out to be the hawking - page transition between a cold gas of particles , and a schwarzschild ads bh @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of thermodynamics of bhs in ads spacetime is instrumental to the deeper understanding of the above scenario .",
    "+ on the other hand , schwarzschild ads bh suffers from the same pathologies as the corresponding solution without cosmological constant .",
    "for example , hawking temperature is divergent as the horizon is shrinks to zero , and there is a curvature singularity at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "+ recently , we have found pathology - free , regular bh solutions of einstein equations , that led to new predictions about the terminal phase of quantum evaporation @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite regular bh creation in a desitter background geometry was studied and it was found that these objects would have been plentifully produced during inflationary times , for planckian values of the cosmological constant .",
    "+ motivated by the promising results quoted above , we would like to analyze thermodynamical behavior of neutral , non - spinning , _ regular _ bh in @xmath0 background with @xmath12 .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in sect.(2 ) we review the @xmath13 einstein equations with a gaussian source and a negative cosmological constant .",
    "regular schwarzschild @xmath0 bh is introduced and discussed from a geometrical point of view . in sect.(3 ) we pave the way to the study of thermodynamics of the solution presented in sect(2 ) . and compute the hawking temperature , the bh entropy and off - shell free energy . in sect.(4 ) we study the phase transitions in our model .",
    "two regions of the ``  coupling constant  '' @xmath1 are described .",
    "a rich phase structure emerges in the weak - coupling regime @xmath14 , with important differences with respect to the hawking - page scenario in the near - extremal region .",
    "the resulting picture closely resembles first order phase transitions in a finite temperature quantum field theory@xcite . on the other hand in the `` string - coupling '' regime @xmath15",
    "there is always a single bh at any temeperature .",
    "finally , in sect(5 ) we summarize the results obtained and stress the novel features .",
    "in this section a brief review of the ideas underlying regular bh solutions of einstein equations is given .",
    "we work in @xmath13 spacetime being the proper dimension for the @xmath16 correspondence .",
    "+ the line element is a static , spherically symmetric solution of the @xmath13 einstein equations , with a negative cosmological constant @xmath17(ads ) . for the positive cosmological constant case ,",
    "see @xcite . the energy momentum tensor leading to the regular metric is of the anisotropic fluid form @xcite , with the gaussian matter source .",
    "this type of matter distribution emulates non - commutativity of space - time through a parameter @xmath18 corresponding to the area of an elementary cell .",
    "its components are given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a total mass - energy of the source and @xmath3 is a natural uv cut - off curing short distance infinities .",
    "these ideas , based on uv divergence - free field theory models described in @xcite and applied to a quantum gravity model , allow interpretation of parameter @xmath18 in different terms : string induced non - commutative geometry @xcite , zero - point length @xcite , etc . , depending on the assumed underlying fundamental quantum gravity theory .",
    "+ the advantage of our approach is that , contrary to the star - product approach description , there is no need to modify the metric part of einstein equations .",
    "rather ,  quantum ",
    "effects are incorporated through the energy - momentum tensor .",

    "different possibilities are determined by the interplay between uv and ir physics characterized by @xmath18 and @xmath28 parameters respectively . giving opposite contributions to the short distance energy density",
    "leads to three different situations : fine tuning of parameters leads to minkowski metric ; prevailing @xmath18 gives desitter , while prevailing @xmath28 leads to ads .",
    "+ the short - distance behavior allows an intriguing interpretation in terms of the effective gravitational coupling as follows : let us introduce @xmath29 as    @xmath30    the effect of the smeared coordinates can be interpreted as the vanishing of the `` _ _ running _ _ '' gravitational constant as @xmath31 .",
    "thus , our model can be viewed as an effective _ asymptotically free _ gravitational model as shorter distances are probed .",
    "we remark that the weakening of gravity leads _ only _ to the absence of curvature singularities but does not prevent formation of bhs . even in the case of the extremal bhs , the horizon radius @xmath32 is still few @xmath3 units and @xmath33 is big enough to create an event horizon .",
    "+ one of the novel features of the our regular solution is the existence of _ multiple _ horizons , unlike ordinary schwarzschild solution .",
    "unfortunately , due to the complicated metric function , horizon equation can not be solved explicitly .",

    "for @xmath53 there is no horizon and the solution ( [ sol ] ) represents a maximally localized mass in an ads background .",
    "+ the existence of a stable , minimal size , bh has interesting consequences which have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "if we assume the free parameter @xmath20 in the metric to be the mass of an `` elementary '' object , then the solution ( [ sol ] ) can be considered as a family containing _ particle - like _ , light objects for @xmath54 and _ black _ , massive object for @xmath48 .",

    "we found that , at large distances , the behavior is the same as in hawking - page scheme .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cosmological constant dominates in the deep infra - red .",

    ", there is no pure radiation phase , rather there are a _",
    "plethora _ of different bh states ranging from single , near - extremal configuration to multiple bh states with the same temperature , but different stability conditions .",
    "+ another very interesting feature of regular bhs is that in the strong - coupling regime there is always only a single bh at any temperature .",
    "+ while we were completing this paper , we came across of @xcite where the same model has been studied in @xmath11 .",
    "the ideas presented in that paper follow the same reasoning as in @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , looks more like a mathematical analogy based on the similarity between the van der walls @xmath120-@xmath121 curve , for a real gas , and the @xmath122 curve as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "although one may accept that this analogy is suggestive , it is hardly an exact correspondence since @xmath123 is interpreted as ``  pressure  '' .",
    "also it mixes intensive and extensive thermodynamical variables as noticed in @xcite .",
    "+ our intention in this paper was not to rely on any formal analogy , but to develop a physically based picture of the thermodynamical evolution of regular sads bhs studying the temperature and off - shell free energy .",
    "a very important out - come of our analysis is that relevant information can be extracted both from the graph of the hawking temperature and off - shell free energy .",
    "this gives alternative possibility with respect to finite temperature quantum field theory where information can be recovered only from the effective potential playing the role of off - shell free energy .",
