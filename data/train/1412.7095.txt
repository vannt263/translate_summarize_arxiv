    "the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation and its generalisations are successfully used to describe long weakly - nonlinear internal waves that are commonly observed in the oceans @xcite , as well as describing weakly - nonlinear shallow - water surface waves @xcite .",
    "the waves described by these models have plane or nearly - plane fronts .",
    "however , waves registered by satellite observations often look like a part of a ring , motivating the present study of annular waves ( see figure 1 for the image of a nearly annular internal soliton found at @xmath0 ) . a very large collection of images of various nonlinear internal waves can be found at @xmath1 observations of internal waves with curvilinear fronts have been reported in several studies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "internal waves have a strong effect on acoustic signalling , as well impacting submersibles , offshore structures , and underwater pipelines .",
    "they also significantly contribute to the ocean mixing processes .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop a good understanding of the main properties and behaviour of the waves . in natural oceanic environments",
    "these waves often propagate over currents , for example , tides , wind - drift currents , river flows , etc .",
    "thus , we aim to develop an asymptotic theory which could be used to model long ring waves in a stratified fluid over a shear flow . in this paper",
    "we focus on the basic balance between nonlinearity and dispersion , considering waves with cylindrical divergence on horizontal shear flows in the kdv regime .",
    "currently , there is a considerable interest to both internal and surface waves on sheared currents . among recent results ,",
    "the effect of a shear flow on the linear surface ship waves was studied by @xcite , while approximations to periodic travelling surface wave profiles in flows with constant vorticity have been obtained by @xcite . @xcite",
    "have studied how vorticity modifies the modulational instability properties of weakly - nonlinear surface wave trains .",
    "analytical considerations of the latter paper complemented an earlier study by @xcite and a strongly - nonlinear numerical analysis developed by @xcite .",
    "the complementary nature of the analytical weakly - nonlinear studies and strongly - nonlinear numerical modelling is also notable in the research on internal waves .",
    "analytical studies help to identify the main trends and dependencies , creating the framework for the discussion of the observed and modelled phenomena , while advanced numerical modelling allows one to describe important features of the waves in more realistic settings not amenable to theoretical analysis ( see , for example , the reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of various sheared currents on internal waves and their role in the oceanic processes have been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "modifications of large internal solitary waves by a background shear flow have been studied analytically by @xcite and modelled numerically , for example , by @xcite and @xcite , within the framework of two - dimensional simulations .",
    "three - dimensional numerical modelling , although expensive , has also been developed . in particular , large - amplitude internal waves in the strait of gibraltar",
    "have been modelled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "tidal generation of internal waves in the celtic sea has been modelled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that the waves generated in the strait of gibraltar are nearly annular ( see figure 1 ) , as are the waves generated near a sea mountain in the celtic sea ( see figure a1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the cylindrical ( or concentric ) korteweg - de vries ( ckdv ) equation is a universal weakly - nonlinear weakly - dispersive wave equation in cylindrical geometry .",
    "originally derived in the context of ion - acoustic waves in plasma @xcite , it was later derived for the surface waves in a uniform fluid , first from boussinesq equations @xcite , and then from the full euler equations @xcite .",
    "versions of the equation were also derived for internal waves in a stratified fluid without shear flow @xcite , and surface waves in a uniform fluid with a shear flow @xcite .",
    "the original equation is integrable @xcite , and there exists a useful map between ckdv and kp equations @xcite , while a generic shear flow leads to a nonintegrable ckdv - type equation .    in this paper , we study the propagation of internal and surface ring waves in a stratified fluid over a prescribed shear flow , generalising the previous studies .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive a 2 + 1 - dimensional ckdv - type model for the amplitudes of surface and internal waves , by finding an appropriate linear modal decomposition ( different from the known modal decomposition in cartesian coordinates ) and using techniques from the asymptotic multiple - scales analysis .",
    "the detailed structure of the wavefronts is analysed analytically , for the case of a two - layer model with a piecewise - constant current , in section 3 .",
    "we also obtain conditions guaranteeing that there are no critical levels , and calculate explicit expressions for the coefficients of the derived amplitude equation , listed in appendix a. some conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "we consider a ring wave propagating in an inviscid incompressible fluid , described by the full set of euler equations : @xmath2 with the free surface and rigid bottom boundary conditions appropriate for the oceanic conditions : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 are the velocity components in @xmath5 directions respectively , @xmath6 is the pressure , @xmath7 is the density , @xmath8 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath9 is the free surface depth ( with @xmath10 at the bottom ) , and @xmath11 is the constant atmospheric pressure at the surface .",
    "we assume that in the basic state @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is a horizontal shear flow in the @xmath14-direction , and @xmath15 is a stable background density stratification ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the vertical particle displacement @xmath16 as an additional dependent variable , which is defined by the equation @xmath17 and satisfies the obvious surface boundary condition @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the unperturbed depth of the fluid .",
    "we aim to derive an amplitude equation for the amplitudes of the long surface and internal waves .",
    "thus , we use the following non - dimensional variables : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the wave length , @xmath22 is the wave amplitude , @xmath23 is the typical long - wave speed of surface or internal waves ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 , respectively , where @xmath26 is a typical value of the buoyancy frequency , and @xmath27 is a typical depth of the stratified layer ) , @xmath28 is the dimensional reference density of the fluid , while @xmath29 is the non - dimensional function describing stratification in the basic state , and @xmath30 is the non - dimensional free surface elevation . in both cases non - dimensionalisation leads to the appearance of the same small parameters in the problem , the amplitude parameter @xmath31 and the wavelength parameter @xmath32 . in the second case , a third small ( boussinesq ) parameter will appear as well , but the boussinesq approximation is not used in the subsequent derivation .",
    "thus , it is natural to non - dimensionalise the general problem formulation , including both surface and internal waves , using the parameters of the faster surface waves , and measure the speeds of the internal waves as fractions of the surface wave speed , etc .",
    "however , if one is primarily interested in the study of internal waves , it is more natural to use the typical speed of the internal waves .    introducing the cylindrical coordinate system moving at a constant speed @xmath33 ( a natural choice is the flow speed at the bottom , as we will show later ) , considering deviations from the basic state ( the same notations @xmath34 and @xmath35 have been used for the projections of the deviations of the speed on the new coordinate axis ) , and scaling the appropriate variables using the amplitude parameter @xmath36 , @xmath37 we arrive at the following non - dimensional problem formulation in the moving cylindrical coordinate frame : @xmath38 + p_r = 0 , \\label{1a}\\\\   & & ( \\rho_0 + \\varepsilon \\rho ) \\left [ v_t + \\varepsilon \\left",

    "indeed , variables can be scaled further to replace @xmath41 with @xmath36 in the equations @xcite .",
    "we look for a solution of this problem in the form of asymptotic multiple - scales expansions of the form @xmath42 and similar expansions for other variables , where @xmath43 with the following set of fast and slow variables : @xmath44 where we define @xmath45 to be the wave speed in the absence of a shear flow ( with @xmath46 ) , while for a given shear flow the function @xmath47 describes the distortion of the wavefront and is to be determined . in this description , when a shear flow is present , the wave speed in the direction @xmath48 is not equal to @xmath45 , but to @xmath49 .",
    "the choice of the fast and slow variables is similar to that in the derivation of the ckdv - type equation for the surface waves @xcite , with the formal range of asymptotic validity of the model being defined by the conditions @xmath50 . to leading order ,",
    "the wavefront at any fixed moment of time @xmath51 is described by the equation @xmath52 and we consider outward propagating ring waves , requiring that the function @xmath47 is strictly positive . by writing ( [ 11 ] ) we anticipate that the solution of the linearised problem allows for a modal decomposition , similar to the well - known result in the cartesian geometry , but expect that it has a more complicated structure for the ring waves on a shear flow because of the loss of the radial symmetry in the problem formulation ( the shear flow is horizontal ) . to leading order , assuming that perturbations of the basic state are caused only by the propagating wave , we obtain @xmath53 where the function @xmath54 satisfies the following modal equations : @xmath55 and @xmath56 where we now have fixed the speed of the moving coordinate frame @xmath33 to be equal to the speed of the shear flow at the bottom , @xmath57 ( then , @xmath58 at @xmath10 , and the condition @xmath59 at @xmath60 implies ( [ m3 ] ) ) .",
    "of course , the physics does not depend on the choice of @xmath33 ( see a discussion in @xcite ) , but our derivation shows that the mathematical formulation simplifies if we choose @xmath61 . for a given density stratification the values of the wave speed @xmath45 , found assuming the absence of the shear flow , and the pair of functions @xmath54 and @xmath47 , found for a given shear flow , constitute solution of the modal equations ( [ m1 ] ) - ( [ m3 ] ) . unlike the surface wave problem considered by @xcite , the exact form of equations for the wave speed @xmath45 and the function @xmath47 depend on stratification .",

    "we obtain : @xmath106 since @xmath107 on the singular solution , we have @xmath108    thus , the amplitude equation reduces to the form of the 1 + 1 - dimensional ckdv - type equation ( i.e. @xmath109 ) for _ any shear flow _ , and not just for stationary and constant shear flows , as previously thought @xcite .    substituting the modal function ( [ mf ] ) into the expressions for the remaining coefficients ( [ c1 ] ) - ( [ c4 ] ) , the amplitude equation can be written as @xmath110 and the expressions for the coefficients can be brought to the previously known form @xcite : @xmath111 we note that unlike the formula for @xmath112 above , our representation of the coefficients by the formulae ( [ c1 ] ) - ( [ c4 ] ) does not involve multiple integrals .",

    "if there is no shear flow , i.e. @xmath113 , the ring waves become concentric waves . here , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "then , the derived equation ( [ ckdv ] ) again reduces to the form of the 1 + 1-dimensional ckdv - type equation @xmath117 and expressions for the coefficients are given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the modal function , satisfying the same equations as in cartesian geometry : @xmath120 this reduction agrees with the equation previously derived by lipovskii @xcite .",
    "thus , in both cases the derived amplitude equation ( [ ckdv ] ) correctly reduces to the previously derived models .",
    "importantly , in both of these previously studied cases the coefficient @xmath109 . however , it is not equal to zero in the general case of the waves in a stratified fluid with a shear flow .",
    "interestingly , johnson has caught the ` ghost ' of the additional term in his study of the surface waves on a shear flow . however , as we discussed earlier , the complicated formula for the coefficient @xmath121 given by johnson @xcite will lead to a zero coefficient for any shear flow .",
    "in order to clarify the general theory developed in the previous section and to illustrate the different effect of a shear flow on the wavefronts of surface and internal ring waves , here we discuss a simple piecewise - constant setting , frequently used in theoretical and laboratory studies of long internal and surface waves ( figure 3 , see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in these theoretical and laboratory studies , the model is often chosen to yield explicit formulae , but is regarded as a reasonable abstraction for a background flow with smooth density and shear profiles across the interface , in the long wave approximation .",
    "it is also necessary to note that this background flow is subject to kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability arising as short waves , which are excluded in the long wave theory due to the large separation of scales ( see @xcite and references therein ) .        here , in non - dimensional form , both the density of the fluid and the shear flow are piecewise - constant functions ( @xmath122 ) : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the thickness of the lower layer and @xmath125 is the heaviside function . in the rigid lid approximation ,",

    "long interfacial waves are observed both in experiments and in natural environments ( for example , see reviews by @xcite ) , which means that in the situations when they are observed there exist some extra mechanisms which prevent the development of the k - h instability . among such stabilising mechanisms not present in the simplified model",
    "are the continuity of the actual density and shear flow profiles , with a thin intermediate layer in between the two main layers , and surface tension ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "we see that the shear flow has very different effect on the surface and internal ring waves : the surface ring waves shown in figure 8 are elongated in the direction of the shear flow , while the interfacial ring waves shown in figure 9 are squeezed in the direction of the flow .",
    "we note that , in a different setting , the deformation of surface ship wakes by the sheared current was recently discussed by @xcite , which is related to the deformation of the surface ring waves .",
    "we also note that when the value of @xmath198 is increased , there is a threshold after which the equation for @xmath47 corresponding to interfacial waves does not have a real - valued solution .",

    "the modal equation is given by @xcite : @xmath201 in the two - layer case , the dispersion relation takes the form @xmath202 this dispersion relation also follows from the results obtained by @xcite for the free surface two - layer shallow water model . substituting the coefficients @xmath203 into the general solution of this quartic equation , one obtains the following formula for the wave speed @xmath204 : @xmath205 letting the cartesian coordinate frame move at the speed @xmath206",

    "both surface and internal waves can propagate when there is no shear flow ( @xmath207 . ) when the strength of the shear flow is increased ( @xmath208 ) , the difference between the speeds of the surface waves along and opposite the flow increases , while a similar difference for the internal waves decreases .",
    "this indicates that the wavefronts of the surface waves become elongated in the direction of the flow , while the wavefronts of the internal waves are indeed squeezed in this direction .",
    "the graph also shows the onset of the k - h instability for the long waves at @xmath209 and stabilisation for the values of the shear flow exceeding @xmath210 , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",

    "the critical layer is a region in the neighbourhood of a line at which the local wave speed is equal to the shear flow speed , see @xcite and references therein . in this paper , we only consider a relatively weak shear flow , when the critical layer does not appear , which we justify next .",
    "the wavefront can be described as @xmath211 following @xcite , we find that the local wave speed in the direction @xmath212 is given by @xmath213 so the critical layer occurs when @xmath214 which is equivalent to the condition @xmath215 when the linear problem formulation fails .",
    "note that @xmath216 .",

    "however , since @xmath228 represents the local wave speed in the direction of @xmath48 , we know that @xmath229 , implying that @xmath230 . thus , we can replace the exact condition ( [ cl ] ) with a simplified estimate : @xmath231    thus , if the shear flow satisfies both conditions ( [ ucl ] ) and ( [ crl ] ) , the long interfacial ring waves are k - h stable , and there are no critical layers .",
    "the coefficients of the derived @xmath232- dimensional amplitude equation ( [ ckdv ] ) for both surface and interfacial ring waves in this two - layer case are listed in appendix a.",
    "in this paper , we developed an asymptotic theory describing the propagation of long linear and weakly - nonlinear ring waves in a stratified fluid over a shear flow in the kdv regime .",
    "the theory is based on the existence of a suitable linear modal decomposition , which has more complicated structure than the known modal decomposition in cartesian geometry , when waves propagate along or opposite the horizontal shear flow . in our formulation ,",
    "the shear flow is horizontal , while the waves in the absence of the shear flow are concentric .",
    "thus , there is a clash of geometries , and it is not clear a priori that there is any modal decomposition .",
    "the developed linear formulation provides , in particular , a description of the distortion of the shape of the wavefronts of the ring waves by the shear flow , which has been illustrated by considering the classical setting of a two - layer fluid with a piecewise - constant current .",
    "the wavefronts of surface and interfacial ring waves were described in terms of two branches of the singular solution of the derived nonlinear first - order differential equation , constituting further generalisation of the well - known burns and generalised burns conditions @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the two branches of this singular solution could be described in parametric form , and an explicit analytical solution was developed for the wavefront of the interfacial mode in the case of the low density contrast .",
    "the constructed solutions have revealed the qualitatively different behaviour of the wavefronts of surface and interfacial waves propagating over the same shear flow .",
    "indeed , while the wavefront of the surface ring wave is elongated in the direction of the flow , the wavefront of the interfacial wave is squeezed in this direction .",
    "the derived @xmath232 - dimensional cylindrical korteweg - de vries type equation constitutes generalisation of the previously derived @xmath233 - dimensional equation for the surface waves in a homogeneous fluid over a shear flow @xcite and internal waves in a stratified fluid in the absence of a shear flow @xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", johnson has derived a @xmath232 - dimensional model @xcite , but as a by - product of our study we have shown that the complicated formula for one of the coefficients of his equation will yield zero coefficient for any shear flow , which then reduces the equation to a @xmath233 - dimensional model . finally , for the case of the two - layer model we also derived a constraint on the strength of the shear flow , which guarantees that there are no critical layers , and obtained explicit expressions for the coefficients of the derived amplitude equation in terms of the physical and geometrical parameters of the model , which provides a fully developed asymptotic theory for this case .",
    "further work will include numerical and analytical studies of the long weakly - nonlinear ring waves using the derived equation .",
    "it should be noted that the derived model can be generalised to include the effects of variable environment and rotation , similar to the existing studies for the plane waves ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the modal decomposition found in this paper",
    "can be used to derive other long ring wave models , similar to the benjamin - ono and intermediate - depth equations for the plane waves @xcite .",
    "finally , we conjecture that theoretical results developed in this paper are relevant to the description of the nearly annular internal waves observed in the oceans . such waves are generated in straits ( e.g. , in the strait of gibraltar , see figure 1 ) , river - sea interaction zones ( e.g. , by a columbia river plume , see @xcite ) and by scattering from localised topographic features ( e.g. , from a sea mountain in the celtic sea , see @xcite ) . while the observed waves are often strongly - nonlinear , previous studies of such waves within the scope of the kdv - like models and their generalisations suggest that this is a useful asymptotic regime for this class of problems ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "squeezing of the wavefronts of interfacial ring waves in the direction of the shear flow should be a prominent feature , and we conjecture that this might be a factor contributing to the change of the shape of internal waves generated by an exchange flow in the strait of gibraltar , visible in figure 11 for the waves propagating further into the mediteranian sea , as well as to the change of the shape of the internal spiral waves generated by a tidal flow near a sea mountain in figure a1 of @xcite .",
