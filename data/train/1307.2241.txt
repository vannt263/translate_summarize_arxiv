    "introducing heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos to the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics can provide a solution to several phenomena beyond the sm .",
    "for one , the active neutrinos acquire naturally small majorana masses through the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , in accordance with neutrino oscillation experiments . furthermore , the apparent asymmetry of matter over antimatter is explained via leptogenesis  @xcite through the @xmath2-violating leptonic decay of the heavy sterile neutrinos in the early universe .",
    "the resulting lepton asymmetry is then partially transferred to the baryon sector via sphalerons , i.e.  nonperturbative processes violating baryon plus lepton number ( @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "one of the inherent predictions of this framework is the majorana nature of the light neutrinos  the neutrino is its own antiparticle and @xmath0 is a broken symmetry .",
    "this allows , most importantly , for neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite , which has yet to be observed . until then",
    ", the question of the neutrino nature is still open , and neutrinos might just be dirac particles like all other known fermions . in order to generate the necessary sub - ev masses for the neutrinos , the yukawa couplings @xmath4 to the sm higgs boson @xmath5 then have to be tiny , @xmath6 . over the years",
    ", many models have been brought forward to explain these small couplings in a more natural way  @xcite , and even a leptogenesis mechanism with dirac neutrinos was proposed  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this so - called neutrinogenesis makes use of the fact that the yukawa couplings are too small to thermalize the right - handed neutrinos ( rhns ) in the early universe .",
    "the @xmath2-violating , but @xmath7-conserving , decay of some heavy particle can then create an asymmetry for left - handed leptons @xmath8 that is canceled by an asymmetry for the right - handed leptons @xmath9 . with all particles in equilibrium , these asymmetries would be washed out by the sphalerons ; however , due to the small couplings , any @xmath10 stored in the rhns will be smuggled past the sphalerons , which consequently create a nonzero baryon asymmetry only from @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting and very different route to motivate light dirac neutrinos has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a second higgs doublet @xmath11 is introduced , which couples exclusively to neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "a small vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , say @xmath12{ev}$ ] , is then the reason for small neutrino masses , while the yukawa couplings can be large .",
    "this leads to distinctive collider signatures  @xcite , but also makes standard neutrinogenesis impossible . in this paper",
    "we will provide a new kind of dirac leptogenesis , which relies on thermalized rhns and therefore works for the neutrinophilic two - higgs - doublet solution of small dirac masses .",
    "our mechanism uses the recently introduced framework of lepton - number - violating ( lnv ) dirac neutrinos  @xcite to create a lepton asymmetry from the @xmath2-violating decay of a heavy particle . as such",
    ", the mechanism is actually more reminiscent of standard leptogenesis than neutrinogenesis , even though it contains dirac neutrinos .",
    "let us briefly review the simplest model for lepton - number - violating dirac neutrinos , brought forward in ref .",
    "we work with a gauged @xmath0 symmetry , three rhns @xmath13 , one scalar @xmath14 to break @xmath0 , and one scalar @xmath15 as a mediator , all of which are singlets under the sm gauge group .",
    "the lagrangian takes the form @xmath16 @xmath5 being the sm higgs doublet .",
    "if @xmath17 does not acquire a vev , the neutrinos will be dirac particles with mass matrix @xmath18 .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses is , in this simple model , a result of very small couplings , @xmath19 .",
    "the symmetric yukawa coupling matrix @xmath20 is nondiagonal and complex in general , which is important for our leptogenesis application in the next section . the scalar potential takes the form @xmath21 with symmetric couplings @xmath22 . choosing the structure @xmath23",
    ", one can easily realize a potential with minimum @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which breaks @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "an exact @xmath28 symmetry remains , under which leptons transform as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , making the neutrinos dirac particles but still allowing for @xmath31 lnv processes . as a means to forbid majorana",
    "neutrino masses was also mentioned in ref  @xcite . ] the crucial @xmath32 term in the potential will induce a mass splitting between the real scalars @xmath33 in @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a common mass term that is of no importance here . since the @xmath33 can decay in either @xmath37 or @xmath38 , lepton number",
    "is clearly violated , even though our model has dirac neutrinos .",
    "the scalars also induce a @xmath39 scattering @xmath40 and potentially mediate neutrinoless quadruple beta decay @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "let us note that the @xmath28 symmetry left over after breaking @xmath0 could also be used as the stabilizing symmetry behind dark matter .",
    "for example , an even @xmath0 charge for a newly introduced dirac fermion would make it exactly stable , because all other fermions in the sm@xmath42 carry odd @xmath0 charge .",
    "as seen above , neutrinos are dirac particles in our model , yet @xmath0 is broken , which makes possible a real dirac lepto__genesis _ _ , where a lepton asymmetry is created by the @xmath2-violating @xmath43 decay of some heavy particle . in order for this to work , the decay has to take place after @xmath0 breaking and before the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , so that sphalerons can convert the lepton asymmetry to the baryons ( assuming @xmath44 as induced in our model ) .    for a simple realization , we use the framework of the previous section and add second copies of both @xmath17 and @xmath5 , both @xmath45 without vevs .",
    "below the @xmath0 breaking scale , @xmath46 and @xmath47 now split into four real scalars @xmath33 , with decay channels @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath47 is necessary to obtain @xmath2 violation in these decays ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : leptogenesis ] ) , as we will see below .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium decay of the lightest @xmath33 then has all the necessary qualitative features to create an asymmetry @xmath50 in the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this in itself would not suffice for baryogenesis , as the sphalerons do not see the right - handed @xmath50 , and the higgs yukawa couplings @xmath51 from eq .",
    "are too small to efficiently convert @xmath50 to the left - handed lepton doublets .",
    "this is where the second higgs doublet @xmath11 comes in , as it can have large enough yukawa couplings @xmath52 to thermalize @xmath53 and transfer @xmath54 .",
    "from there , sphalerons take over to convert @xmath8 to the baryons @xmath55 in the usual leptogenesis fashion ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    the second higgs doublet @xmath11 will be chosen to be neutrinophilic , i.e.  with a small vev  @xcite .",
    "while this is not strictly necessary for our version of dirac leptogenesis  for example , a vev - less @xmath11 with large yukawas would work as well , the neutrinos gaining mass via @xmath56it is the most interesting two - higgs - doublet model  @xcite for our purposes , as it additionally sheds light on the small neutrino masses .",
    "to this effect , let us mention briefly how the neutrinophilic nature of @xmath11 can be realized in our context .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we impose an additional global @xmath57 symmetry ( or a @xmath58 as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) under which only @xmath11 and @xmath53 are charged , forbidding all @xmath11 yukawa couplings except @xmath52 .",
    "the new symmetry is broken softly by a term @xmath59 in the scalar potential .",
    "a small @xmath60 is technically natural and will induce a small vev for @xmath11 , @xmath61 , which gives naturally small dirac neutrino masses @xmath62 .",
    "we stress that our additional @xmath0 symmetry and scalars , compared to refs .",
    "@xcite , in no way complicate or interfere with this realization of a neutrinophilic @xmath11 , so we will not go into any more details .",
    "-violating vertex and self - energy loop corrections to the lnv decay @xmath63 relevant for leptogenesis.,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    after these qualitative statements , let us delve into a more quantitative analysis of our leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "the scalar potential for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is more involved than before ( eq .  ) , but the only qualitatively new terms are @xmath67 as they lead to a mixing of the four real fields @xmath33 contained in @xmath66 after breaking @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath68 mass matrix for the @xmath33 is not particularly illuminating , and a diagonalization just redefines the couplings @xmath69 to the rhns ( see eq .  ) .",
    "since the resulting couplings are the only relevant ones for leptogenesis , we can skip all these steps and just work with four real scalar fields @xmath33 with masses @xmath70 and complex symmetric yukawa couplings @xmath71 , @xmath72 where implicit sums are understood and @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74 interactions will keep the sm particles and the new scalars and rhns in equilibrium above @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the effective number of degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath77 and @xmath78{gev}$ ] the planck mass .",
    "below @xmath79 , the real scalars @xmath33 will only be coupled to the sm via the higgs portal ( assumed to be small for simplicity ) and the rhn interactions from eq .  .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium condition for the decay of the lightest @xmath80 then reads @xmath81 @xmath82 being the hubble expansion rate of the universe at temperature @xmath77 ( not to be confused with the higgs fields @xmath83 ) . as with the bulk of leptogenesis models ,",

    ", the decay of the lightest @xmath80 then leads to a @xmath2 asymmetry due to interference of tree - level and one - loop diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : leptogenesis ] ) : @xmath86 where we already summed over flavor indices and included a factor of @xmath87 because two rhns are created per decay .",

    "vanishes because the trace of a hermitian matrix is real .",
    "one can also convince oneself that the second @xmath47 is indeed necessary for the @xmath2 asymmetry , as the couplings of just one field @xmath94 would lead to the yukawa - coupling relation @xmath95 and ultimately @xmath96 .",
    "let us consider one last limiting case before we move on : neglecting the @xmath46@xmath47 mixing terms in the scalar potential   gives @xmath97 , @xmath98 and the relations @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "assuming @xmath101 to be the lightest of the four scalars , @xmath102 does not contribute to @xmath103 by the argument given above .",
    "the contributions of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are opposite in sign , so that @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the asymmetry therefore vanishes for @xmath108 , as it should , because this would imply @xmath0 conservation .",
    "compared to other leptogenesis scenarios , the asymmetries from vertex and self - energy corrections in our model depend on different flavor parameters  even in the unflavored case  because @xmath109 for a general matrix @xmath110 .",
    "the asymmetries are nevertheless qualitatively reminiscent of standard leptogenesis , with the same rough behavior @xmath111ignoring the complex matrix structure of @xmath112 and assuming a hierarchy @xmath113 .",
    "a low - scale resonant leptogenesis is of course also possible in our framework , but goes beyond the scope of this paper .    the total lepton asymmetry , i.e.  the rhn number density @xmath114 relative to the entropy density @xmath115 , is then given by @xmath116",
    "since we assume equilibrium of the sm particles with the rhns as well as the sphalerons , we can use chemical potentials to describe the plasma .",
    "( note that @xmath0 is effectively conserved once the @xmath33 have dropped out . ) consequently , the chemical potential for the rhns has to be added to the usual set of equations  @xcite , resulting in the equilibrium condition @xmath117 , or @xmath118 for three generations ( and an arbitrary number of higgs doublets ) , compared to @xmath119 for standard leptogenesis with one higgs doublet .",
    "the condition @xmath117 can also be understood with the help of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out that @xmath120 vanishes if only left - handed fermions and the sphalerons are in equilibrium .",
    "since we introduce fully thermalized right - handed partners to all left - handed fermions , it is no surprise that @xmath117 remains valid .    with all of the above",
    ", it should be clear that our lnv dirac neutrinos can accommodate the observed baryon asymmetry @xmath121 in this novel leptogenesis scenario .",
    "we refrain from a parameter scan , as the yukawa couplings @xmath122 and masses @xmath70 are in any way hardly constrained by other processes or related to other observables , at least for the very heavy @xmath33 considered here .",
    "this leptogenesis mechanism is testable nonetheless , because it requires additional interactions for the rhns .",
    "let us therefore discuss the last crucial piece of the puzzle : the thermalization of the rhns .",
    "the @xmath53 asymmetry needs to be transferred to the left - handed sector before the ewpt in order to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "correspondingly , we need stronger - than - usual interactions for the rhns , in our case by means of the second higgs doublet @xmath11 in @xmath52 . at temperatures above the electroweak scale ,",
    "the interaction rates go with @xmath123 , which equilibrates the rhns if @xmath124  @xcite .",
    "this does not lead to problems because , below the ewpt , the interaction rate drastically changes its form ; the charged higgs @xmath125 , for example , mediates an @xmath126 scattering with rate @xmath127 , i.e.  suppressed by the mass .",
    "the rhn decoupling temperature @xmath128 is then given by the condition @xmath129 at least for large @xmath130 .",
    "if the rhns decouple before the left - handed neutrinos , i.e.  @xmath131{mev}$ ] , the rhn contribution to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath132 will be diluted  @xcite : @xmath133^{4/3 }   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have @xmath134 , and recent planck data constrain @xmath135 at @xmath136 c.l .",

    "these values can even explain the long - standing deviation of the best - fit value of @xmath132 from the sm value @xmath142 , as recently emphasized in ref .",
    "consequently , the second higgs doublet @xmath11 puts the rhns in equilibrium above the ewpt to generate the baryon asymmetry , and then it naturally decouples them to satisfy and ameliorate cosmological constraints . taking the flavor structure of the yukawa couplings @xmath143 into account",

    "this asymmetry resides in the right - handed neutrino sector and requires a second higgs doublet to transfer it to the left - handed leptons and ultimately baryons .",
    "if the second doublet couples exclusively to neutrinos , its small vacuum expectation value can in addition provide a natural explanation for the smallness of the neutrino masses without invoking small yukawa couplings .",
    "the unavoidable partial thermalization of the right - handed neutrinos contributes to the relativistic degrees of freedom in perfect agreement with the persisting observational hints .",
