    "the corresponding energies are    @xmath13    for the harmonic oscillator basis and @xmath14 for the landau basis .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the coulomb interaction matrix element for spatially separated charge carriers , with @xmath4 the length of the separation ( see fig .",
    "[ systemfig ] ) .",
    "then , the matrix element between any two pairs of single - particle states for the @xmath6 case is written as @xmath16    it should be noted that @xmath17 is a 2d in - plane vector .",
    "many authors have found various expressions for these elements @xcite .",
    "for example , using the two - dimensional fourier transform for the coulomb potential @xmath18 it is possible to express the coulomb matrix element in terms of finite sums in the form",
    "@xcite @xmath19    the @xmath20 expresses the conservation of the angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "we have , for convenience , defined the quantities @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "although expression ( [ exact ] ) involves finite sums , it is inefficient for computing matrix elements that involve states of high angular momentum .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the computation of the large factorials .",
    "this renders the calculation of the matrix elements computationally expensive .",
    "an alternative way of calculating the coulomb matrix element is to write @xmath25 by expanding the exponential inside the integral , replacing the result in ( [ forma elemento directo ] ) and integrating the angle and radial variables , we arrive at an explicit infinite series .",
    "the remaining step of calculating the infinite series was tackled successfully in @xcite by making use of a series acceleration algorithm ( different from the one used in this work ) .",
    "let us now proceed to derive an expression for the general case @xmath26 .",
    "the coulomb interaction in this case reads @xmath27",
    "@xmath3 being the angle between the 2d in - plane vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ systemfig ] ) , and the vector @xmath30 being defined as @xmath31 . note that @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath32 are perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "manipulations analogous to those in the previous case , and use of @xmath34 lead to the following expression for the coulomb matrix elements @xmath35    where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the confluent hypergeometric funtion @xcite .",
    "this expression reduces in an equivalent form to ( [ exact ] ) when @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "although our expression involves an infinite sum , we can apply a numerical convergence procedure in order to make the computation of the matrix elements more tractable . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no expression nor procedure for a practical calculation of the coulomb matrix elements of spatially separated charge carriers in a two dimensional confining potential . as mentioned in the introduction , this result is of significant practical importance in finite system studies in various condensed matter systems .",
    "incidentally , we would like to note first that it is possible to reduce the matrix elements satisfying @xmath40 to only radial integrals of complete elliptic functions of the first kind @xmath41 , as long as @xmath42 .",
    "such a simplification is not possible when @xmath6 mainly because of the singular behaviour of the coulomb interaction in such a case .",
    "the resulting integrals read @xmath43 having defined the radial function @xmath44 although the radial integrals have convergence problems for high values of the radial quantum numbers , due to the oscillatory nature of the laguerre polynomials , the elements that can be computed agree with our results which make use of the series acceleration algorithm to be discussed presently .",
    "we calculate the infinite series in the @xmath45 index that appears in ( [ indirecto ] ) using a u - type levin transform to accelerate the convergence @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to construct an alternate series which converges much faster than the one we have at hand .",
    "intuitively , this could be done if there was a way to simulate the asymptotic behaviour of the remainder @xmath46 of the series for large values of @xmath47 .",
    "we can achieve this by constructing functions @xmath48 such that @xmath49 @xmath50 being of order unity .",
    "having done this , we can then write @xmath51 such that the coefficients @xmath52 satisfy @xmath53 . by doing this",
    ", the asymptotic behaviour of the series will have been coded into the @xmath48 quantities .",
    "now we must find a prescription for the coefficients @xmath52 .",
    "this can be done by writing , for large @xmath47 , the expression @xmath54 this expression is reasonable so long as the functions @xmath55 satisfy three conditions : first , we must have @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath58 , so that ( [ asymp ] ) holds ; second , for @xmath59 we must have @xmath60 when @xmath61 ; and third we must require that @xmath62 , so that , in taking the large @xmath47 limit , all terms @xmath63 vanish at the same rate .",
    "the constants @xmath64 are still unknown at this stage of the derivation .    with these definitions ,",
    "the @xmath65 partial sum @xmath66 of our series can be written as , for large @xmath47 , @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the exact value of the series we want to compute . finally , we truncate the sum , thus eliminating asymptotic terms : @xmath69 the corresponding change of notation from the exact @xmath68 to the truncated @xmath70 should be clear . notice that the expression ( [ series_result ] ) tells us that the value @xmath70 is such that all @xmath71 equations , for @xmath47 running from @xmath47 to @xmath72 , hold simultaneously .",
    "that is to say , the truncated value @xmath70 depends on all terms which add up to @xmath70 itself and , thus , it is as if it `` feelt '' the overall behaviour of the most important terms of the series . in this sense",
    ", the value calculated through the use of the u - type levin transform can be thought of as an extrapolation of the final sum that uses information from only the first few terms of the complete series .",
    "the more terms we keep in the truncation , the better the extrapolation .    in order to find the approximation",
    "@xmath70 to the full sum , it is necessary to solve the @xmath71 equations for the @xmath71 unknowns @xmath70 and @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the resulting problem of calculating the series has been reduced to computing the solution of a @xmath71 dimensional matrix inversion problem",
    ". the larger the value of @xmath74 , the better the approximation to the exact value .",
    "the u - type levin transform uses the choices @xmath75 @xcite and @xmath76 , which have proven to behave well for a large family of series @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is a real number that can be chosen to improve the rate of convergence .    as an example , in our calculations , an element such as @xmath78 required @xmath79 terms of the series to achieve convergence up to the tenth decimal place using the term - by - term sum , whereas it required less than @xmath80 terms using the levin transform , and was calculated in half the time using a standard linear solver . it should be noted that the number of terms needed to achieve convergence will depend on the matrix element that is being calculated and that the calculation time will depend on the machine and the procedure used to solve the linear system that results from the levin transform .     for : * ( top ) * in the ordering of the harmonic oscillator basis . *",

    "the parentheses denote the quantum numbers @xmath81,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we first evaluate some particular matrix elements in order to get a feeling of how they vary as functions of the distance @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig_diag ] ) , we show the behavior of the coulomb matrix elements of the form @xmath84 as functions of the separation between the planes , for both the oscillator and landau basis . for both basis sets",
    ", there is a general decaying behaviour .",
    "clearly , when @xmath85 , all elements must approach zero .",
    "refer to the appendix for the notation used for the basis sets .",
    "although , there is a one - to - one correspondence between both basis sets , there is a physical reason which justifies showing the calculations in both basis .",
    "the landau basis corresponds to the solution of a charged particle moving in an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion .",
    "this system is infinitely degenerate with respect to the angular momentum quantum number and , hence , its ordering is conceptually different to the finite number of degenerate energy levels of the two dimensional harmonic oscillator system .",
    "thus , showing the calculation in each basis set is relevant for each of the two different types of in - plane confinement .",
    "next , we construct a set of elements which involves pairs of states with fixed total angular momentum ( i.e. using sets of two - particle states with some predetermined value of their total angular momentum ) . in order to do this ,",
    "such states were randomly chosen for the cases @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_angmom ] ) .",
    "the general exponentially decaying behaviour observed in these plots seems to suggest that there is a scaling behaviour behind elements with predetermined total angular momentum .",
    "this last observation leads to an interesting behaviour which is worth emphasizing .",
    "although all elements get suppressed in general as the distance is increased , they do not all approach zero at the same rate .",
    "such a behaviour can be seen clearly in the top plot of fig.([fig_angmom ] ) : one of the curves crosses two other curves , indicating that it is decaying faster than the other two .",
    "this tells us that , as @xmath4 varies , the entries in the matrix representation of the coulomb interaction vary in nontrivial ways with respect to each other . in the very large @xmath4 limit",
    "i.e. when @xmath85 , we may obtain an expansion for the rate of decay @xmath88 so that not all elements tend asymptotically to zero at the same rates , the rate depending on the indices of the states used in the matrix element .",
    "hence it is possible , by changing the distance between the planes , for a system of charge carriers to exhibit different types of dynamical behaviour , as opposed to just interacting in a kind of screened coulomb potential produced by the separation .",
    "* ( top ) * and @xmath87 * ( bottom ) * as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "this was done with the oscillator ordering . ]    in fig .",
    "( [ directindirect ] ) we show the most relevant elements for the dynamics of coulombian systems , namely @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the so - called direct and exchange terms , using the first energy shell of the landau basis .",
    "note how , as we increase the interplane distance , the direct terms get more suppressed , relative to the @xmath6 value , than the exchange ones .",
    "also , the exchange elements decay faster than the direct ones as we change the index @xmath91 , a behaviour that is general for every @xmath4 .",
    "this decay is expected because the exchange elements involve integrals of amplitudes which can interfere destructively when summed over , as opposed to the direct elements which involve probability densities which are always positive .",
    "finally , the maximum value of the direct term is actually shifted from its diagonal value @xmath92 , and this maximum gets further shifted as @xmath4 increases",
    ". however , the maximum for the exchange plot remains at the diagonal point , although this is actually again the same diagonal ( and , thus , direct ) matrix element @xmath92 .    .",
    "* bottom : * exchange coulomb matrix element of the form @xmath93 .",
    "both plots were done with the index @xmath91 running through the first 60 states of the first landau level , title=\"fig : \" ] . *",
    "bottom : * exchange coulomb matrix element of the form @xmath93 .",
    "both plots were done with the index @xmath91 running through the first 60 states of the first landau level , title=\"fig : \" ]      since the coulomb matrix elements connect two pairs of two - particle states through the coulomb interaction , we can use them to weigh how probable it is for a particular transition to occur as a function of the distance @xmath4 . in order to study a simple transition , we computed the matrix elements for a given pair of initial states and several pairs of final states , all pairs having zero total angular momentum .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_trans ] ) .",
    "each continuous line is the absolute value of the transition amplitude for a given distance @xmath4 and each point represents a final state , as explained in the caption of the figure .",
    "the succession of lines go from @xmath6 through @xmath94 . as @xmath4 increases ,",
    "all points ( i.e. all considered transitions ) generally get suppressed .     value . as @xmath4 increases",
    ", the lines get suppressed .",
    "the initial state corresponds to two particles in @xmath95 ( * top * ) and @xmath96 ( * bottom * ) .",
    "the final two - particle states are ordered horizontally according to the list : @xmath95 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath96 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 . ]    once again , we note that the rate at which each coefficient gets suppressed is not the same for all , the diagonal transition being typically the most significant one , as further calculations of other similar cases have shown .",
    "in fact , when @xmath4 is of order @xmath110 ( i.e. when the distance is of the order of the oscillator length ) , almost all of the coefficients are negligible , except for the diagonal ones .",
    "this reasonably shows that , when the planes are separated beyond the characteristic distance of the system , all transitions get suppressed , albeit at unequal rates .    finally , as a more physical application",
    ", we have considered the simple case of an electron and a hole spatially separated in an effective mass hamiltonian with a harmonic potential .",
    "the eigenstates of this system are those of a single spatially indirect exciton .",
    "the hamiltonian , in dimensionless units , reads @xmath111 in this expression , we have made the convenient definition @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath77 parameter denotes the ratio between the coulomb and harmonic oscillator energies , and the @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the dimensionless harmonic oscillator energies of the electron and the hole , respectively .",
    "the diagonalization for the @xmath86 block of the hamiltonian is shown in fig.([fig_couldiag ] ) .",
    "as before we notice the unequal rates of change as @xmath4 is varied only this time it is evidenced with the eigenenergies of the exciton . as @xmath4 increases , the spectrum tends to the harmonic oscillator energies for two particles with total zero angular momentum , as expected .     for zero total angular momentum .",
    "each continuous line represents a fixed value of @xmath4 .",
    "the inset shows the binding energy , defined as @xmath115 ( i.e. the portion of the energy of the bound electron - hole pair which is due solely to the coulomb interaction ) , as a function of the interplane distance @xmath4 ]      as a consistency check of the above results , we computed an identity involving the coulomb matrix elements , reminiscent of the sum rules encountered in atomic physics .",
    "namely , it can be checked that , provided @xmath40 , we can integrate out the angular integrals exactly to obtain a relation of the form @xmath117 with @xmath118    ) as a function of the number of oscillator states @xmath119 used in the summation , starting from the two particle states which are closer to the state @xmath120 ( the @xmath91 in horizontal axis is an index that denotes the @xmath121 element of the two - particle oscillator basis of the form @xmath119 ) . in this particular example , the state @xmath120 is the ground state .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines are the exact values calculated with the right hand side of eq.([consistency ] ) . ]",
    "note that the convergence of the curve corresponding to @xmath122 is slower than that of the other curves .",
    "this has a simple and clear physical meaning .",
    "as the spatial separation between the planes becomes smaller , it will be easier for the coulomb interaction to induce transitions starting from two particles in the oscillator ground state to two particles in two other higher oscillator states .",
    "this means that all amplitudes that we add in the sum rule become more significant as @xmath4 becomes smaller and , thus , the sum will require more and more terms which involve higher oscillator states . notwithstanding this",
    ", there is clear convergence .",
    "the radial integrals can be evaluated numerically by various methods , which makes the computation of the right hand side of ( [ consistency ] ) completely independent from our main numerical approach , which is in turn used to compute the left hand side .",
    "we found that the relation ( [ consistency ] ) was very well satisfied , as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig_convergence ] ) .",
    "in the work presented here , we have shown the procedure and results of a numerical calculation of the coulomb matrix elements of spatially separated charge carriers confined either by a two dimensional parabolic quantum dot or through the use of a magnetic field .",
    "we have found that , in a very important way , each matrix element is affected differently as @xmath4 is varied .",
    "this could lead to different and interesting physical regimes of a system subject to interparticle coulomb interaction .",
    "although the procedure we have implemented above has worked quite well , it should be noted that , as with any numerical algorithm , care must be taken in evaluating elements with too high a difference in quantum numbers of the involved states e.g. high differences between the @xmath123 and @xmath124 or @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "these cases can become pathological because of the highly oscillatory nature of the associated wavefunctions .",
    "we would like to emphasize the relevance of the procedure presented here . with such elements ,",
    "theoretical studies can be carried out that are comparable with experimental systems .",
    "furthermore , this study is relevant for describing and understanding many - body effects such as collective behaviour and quantum correlations .",
    "work that involves the in - depth study of spatially indirect excitons within a finite system framework using hartre - fock and bcs type approximations is already on the way .",
    "for such a study , the matrix elements computed in the present paper will be critically needed .",
