    "the hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) effect @xcite discovered in @xmath1 was at the heart of the development of the field of quantum optics .",
    "indeed , this discovery led to numerous remarkable multiphoton experiments which have not only deepened our fundamental understanding of multiphoton interference @xcite but have also led to numerous applications in information processing @xcite and imaging @xcite .",
    "the hbt effect fundamentally reveals the second - order coherence of a thermal source .",
    "for example , second - order temporal correlations can be measured after the interaction of multi - mode thermal radiation of given bandwidth @xmath2 with a beam splitter : two detectors at the beam splitter output ports have twice the chance to be triggered at equal times than with a relative time delay longer than the coherence time @xmath3 of the thermal field .",
    "it is interesting to modify the described hbt scheme by adding two unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometers at the beam splitter output ports , the `` control '' port @xmath4 and the `` target '' @xmath5 , as depicted in ( a ) .",
    "we further consider path lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that the time @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the speed of light , is much larger than the coherence time of the source .",
    "can we observe second order interference by performing correlation measurements at equal detection times at the output of the two mach - zehnder interferometers ?",
    "interestingly , in this paper we show that second - order interference between the two pairs @xmath10 and @xmath11 of optical paths ( _ multipath correlation interference _ ) can be observed even if the time delay @xmath8 imprinted by each path in the pair @xmath12 with respect to each path in the pair @xmath13 is much beyond the source coherence time .",
    "furthermore , we describe the similarities and differences between this second - order interference effect and the one demonstrated by franson @xcite in @xmath14 by using a two - photon entangled source .",
    "the fundamental interference phenomenon described here is also of interest in view of the recent studies of simulations of quantum logic operations and entanglement correlations using classical light @xcite . in particular , by considering the interferometric scheme in ( b ) , we demonstrate how this interference effect is able to simulate the result of a controlled - not ( cnot ) logic operation @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined as following : we demonstrate how multipath correlation interference can be observed with a thermal source in section [ sec : intdesc ] ; we apply this novel phenomenon to the simulation of a cnot gate operation in section [ sec : clc ] ; we show how this second - order interference effect can be generalized to interferometers based on arbitrary - order correlation measurements in section [ sec : mpn ] ; and we conclude with discussions in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we consider here the interferometer in ( a ) .",
    "the interferometer has only one source , which generates in the input port @xmath15 thermal light with a given horizontal polarization @xmath16 .",

    "the expectation value depends now on the interference between _ only _ two contributions @xmath69 and @xmath70 associated with the pairs of optical paths @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the paths @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the interferometer are correlated with the paths @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , and _ only _ the corresponding path pairs @xmath71 and @xmath72 _",
    "interfere_. this interference occurs even if the differences @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , between the path lengths in each mach - zehnder interferometer are much larger than the coherence length of the source ( see ) .",
    "indeed , for a thermal source , the interfering contributions @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see ) do not depend on the relative path lengths in each mach - zehnder interferometer but _ only _ on the difference between the delays @xmath79 and @xmath80 between the detected photons in the two output ports before the propagation through the two pairs @xmath71 and @xmath72 of paths , respectively . since these time delays are very small compared to the coherence time of the source ( see ) both pairs @xmath71 and @xmath72 contribute to the observed second - order interference .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the interferometer described here with the famous franson interferometer @xcite , where the state at the output of the beam splitter in ( a ) is substituted by a two - photon entangled state and the coincidence rate for detecting a photon at the same time in both output ports is measured . for a full comparison ,",
    "we first determine the coincidence rate associated with the absorption of a single photon from the field at each of the two output ports of the interferometer in ( a ) considered here .",
    "this corresponds to measure the standard second - order correlation function @xcite in at approximately equal detection times @xmath81 ( see ) and in the conditions ( [ eq : cnot conditions 02a ] ) and ( [ eq : cnot conditions 02aa ] ) for the interferometric optical paths . in particular , by adding the product @xmath82 of the intensities at the two output ports to the second - order interference term @xmath83 found in , we obtain a second - order correlation function @xmath84 with visibility @xmath85 .",
    "this is a crucial difference between the interferometer described here and the franson interferometer , where the second - order correlation function measured at the output at equal detection times manifests second - order interference with @xmath0 visibility . instead , in the interferometer in ( a )",
    ", @xmath0-visibility interference is only achieved by measuring the correlation between the fluctuations in the number of detected photons , where the `` background '' constant term @xmath86 is effectively `` subtracted '' from the second order correlation function .",
    "therefore , the emergence of this interference effect is very different from the physics of two - photon interference based on energy - time entanglement in the franson interferometer .",
    "indeed , in the franson interferometer the interference between the two pairs @xmath87 and @xmath88 of optical paths emerge from the fact that the two input entangled photons are emitted at the same time and the joint emission time is uncertain in the quantum sense .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-visibility second - order interference can be observed even if the first - order coherence length is much less than the difference @xmath89 between the path lengths . in the interferometer",
    "described here , instead , neither an entangled source is used nor any entanglement process occurs . therefore , coincidence events do not necessarily correspond to the absorption from the field of photons which entered the interferometer at the same time . in principle",
    ", the detected photons could have taken any of the four possible pairs of paths from the source to the two detectors .",
    "nonetheless , the interference term @xmath39 in the second - order correlation function , emerging from the measurement of the correlation between the fluctuations in the number of detected photons as an average over all the possible experimental outcomes , contains only the contribution of two indistinguishable pairs @xmath71 and @xmath72 of correlated paths . between the path lengths",
    "in which limit this interference effect for an ideal stationary thermal source .",
    "this is of course not the case in `` real world '' experiments . ] in particular , the interference pattern depends on the _ difference _ @xmath90 in between the relative phases @xmath91 , with @xmath29 , in the two mach - zehnder interferometers .",
    "differently , in the franson interferometer the resulting interference pattern depends on the _ sum _ of the relative phases in the two mach - zehnder interferometers .",
    "the interference phenomenon based on multipath correlations demonstrated in the previous section can be used to reproduce on - demand correlations in different degrees of freedom without the use of entanglement . here , we address , for example , the simulation of a cnot gate operation by encoding these multipath correlations in the polarization degree of freedom .    for this purpose",
    ", we consider the interferometer in ( b ) .",
    "the source at the input port @xmath15 is again described by .",
    "the @xmath16-polarized thermal light impinges on the balanced beam splitter bs1 and , by using half - wave plates , is prepared at the `` control '' port @xmath4 and `` target '' port @xmath5 in two general polarizations @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . here",
    ", the @xmath16 and @xmath94 polarization directions are indicated by the vectors @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "thereby , by introducing the polarization rotations @xmath97 the interferometer transformation associated with the first part of the interferometer connecting the input ports @xmath98 with the ports @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 where we used the expression for the balanced beam - splitter transformation @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "the second part of the interferometer consists of a `` control '' interferometer connecting the ports @xmath4 and @xmath103 and a `` target '' interferometer connecting the ports @xmath5 and @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , the global interferometric evolution is described by the two polarization - dependent transformations @xmath105 and @xmath106 defining the diagonal matrix @xmath107 in particular , in the control interferometer , the light in the polarization modes @xmath16 and @xmath94 at the output of the first polarizing beam splitter pbs1 acquires the time delays @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , with @xmath9 the speed of light , before being recombined at the output of the second polarizing beam splitter pbs2 .",
    "this leads to the control transformation @xmath110 on the other hand , the light in the target interferometer is coherently split into two different paths and recombined by the balanced beam splitters bs2 and bs3 , respectively , independently of the polarization .",
    "the light polarization is unchanged in the path of length @xmath111 .",
    "instead , in the path of length @xmath112 the polarization modes @xmath16 and @xmath94 are flipped ( @xmath113 ) by the not - gate operation @xmath114 implemented by a half - wave plate with axes rotated by @xmath115 with respect to the @xmath16 and @xmath94 axes .",
    "thus the overall target evolution is described by the transformation @xmath116 by using and , we derive the total interferometer matrix @xmath117    we finally address the detection process , consisting of measuring the polarization - dependent correlation between the fluctuations in the number of photons @xmath118 and @xmath119 detected at the control and target ports @xmath29 , respectively , with polarization @xmath120 at time @xmath121 .",

    "appb ] we show , that , in the limits and , becomes @xmath130 with @xmath131 defined in ( [ eq : limit of omega 0 ] ) .    here , similarly to a cnot gate operation , the control path @xmath132 associated with the polarization mode @xmath16",
    "is correlated with the target path @xmath111 where the light polarization remains unchanged ; instead , the control path @xmath133 associated with the polarization mode @xmath94 is correlated with the target path @xmath112 where a not - gate operation occurs . moreover , analogously to the scheme in ( a ) , the two pairs @xmath12 and @xmath13 of optical paths interfere .",
    "let us fully compare now the interferometer in ( b ) with a _ genuine _ cnot entangling operation on the two - qubit input state @xmath134 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are expressed as superpositions of the polarization states @xmath137 and @xmath138 , corresponding to single - photon occupations of the h and v modes , respectively .",
    "a cnot - gate operation on this input state leads to the output entangled state @xmath139 where @xmath140 polarization - correlation measurements over the state @xmath141 occur with a probability @xmath142 comparing with in the limit @xmath143 , we obtain the expectation value @xmath144 which takes into account all the possible outcomes for the product of the photon - number fluctuations measured at the output of the interferometer in ( b ) .",
    "we emphasize that no entanglement process occurs in the interferometer ; therefore the proposed scheme is not an entangling gate .",
    "nonetheless , the measurement of the correlation between the photon - number fluctuations at the two output ports allow us to simulate a cnot - gate operation .",
    "as a `` bonus '' , we find that the correlation signal can be enhanced on demand by increasing the square @xmath145 of the source mean - photon rate , making it robust against technological losses .    as an example , if we fix the polarization angles @xmath146 and @xmath147 in the setup in ( b ) , the expectation value in reads @xmath148 simulating the @xmath149-visibility correlations typical of a bell state @xmath150 even if no bell state is produced .",
    "indeed , neither an entangled source is used , as for example in the experiment of sanaka , kawahara and kuga @xcite , nor an entanglement process occurs in the interferometer as in a genuine cnot gate operation .",
    "nonetheless , an observer @xmath104 can provide to a separate observer @xmath103 the measured fluctuations @xmath151 in the number of photons for a polarization angle @xmath152 ( in a given computational base ) unknown to @xmath104 , who can infer the value of @xmath152 only based on his / her corresponding measurements of @xmath153 ( with @xmath154 in the same computational base ) .",
    "interestingly , differently from a genuine bell state , the correlation between the measurements of the two observers @xmath103 and @xmath104 emerge _ only _ from the expectation value of the product of the corresponding photon number fluctuations @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",

    "this prepared initial state propagates through a @xmath162-port polarization - dependent interferometer , consisting of polarization rotations and @xmath25-type transformations as in ( b ) . finally , the polarization - dependent correlation between the photon - number fluctuations is measured at the @xmath157 output ports at approximately equal detection times .",
    "we emphasize that for @xmath164 one may also measure this correlation by subtracting the product of the independent light intensities at the two detectors from the standard second - order correlation function . differently , in higher order interferometric networks it may be useful to directly measure the correlation between the photon - number fluctuations .",
    "experimentally , the precision in measuring the expectation value of the product of the photon - number fluctuations @xmath165 at each output port @xmath166 of a given network depends on the number @xmath167 of performed measurements . for large numbers @xmath167 of measurements the distribution of the measured mean values is normal around the expectation value with an indetermination given by the indetermination in the distribution of the measurement outcomes normalized by the root of @xmath167 .",
    "evidently , the indetermination in the distribution of the measurement outcomes depends intrinsically on the given @xmath157-order interference network . in general , a scaling in the number of resources typical of a quantum network with genuine entanglement can not be achieved by the scheme described here .",

    "in particular , we introduced a novel interferometer ( see ( a ) ) where full correlations between the interferometric paths @xmath74 and @xmath76 ( @xmath73 and @xmath75 ) emerge at the interferometer output from measuring the correlation between the fluctuations in the number of detected photons at the two output ports .",
    "we showed how the interference between the two pairs @xmath72 and @xmath71 of correlated optical paths occurs even if the time delay imprinted by each path in one pair with respect to each path in the other pair is much larger than the source coherence time .",
    "we also pointed out the differences and the similarities between this interferometer and the well known franson interferometer where an entangled two - photon source is used instead of a thermal source .",
    "the interference effect demonstrated here can be easily observed experimentally : 1 ) it relies on one of the most natural sources which can be easily simulated in a laboratory by using laser light impinging on a fast rotating ground glass @xcite ; 2 ) the calibration of the interferometric paths and of the detection times ( see , and ) can be easily achieved in the case of a thermal source , where the coherence time can range from the order of @xmath168 to @xmath169 . in an analogous way , multipath correlation interference can be also experimentally observed in the spatial domain with a spatial - mode dependent thermal source @xcite .    in conclusion",

    "<S> we theoretically demonstrate a counter - intuitive phenomenon in optical interferometry with a thermal source : the emergence of second - order interference between two pairs of correlated optical paths even if the time delay imprinted by each path in one pair with respect to each path in the other pair is much larger than the source coherence time . </S>",
    "<S> this fundamental effect could be useful for experimental simulations of small - scale quantum circuits and of @xmath0-visibility correlations typical of entangled states of a large number of qubits , with possible applications in high - precision metrology and imaging . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , we demonstrate the polarization - encoded simulation of the operation of the quantum logic gate known as controlled - not gate .    </S>",
