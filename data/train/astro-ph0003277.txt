    "the resonance line doublet of li - like is a sensitive probe of hot collisionally ionized or warm very low density photoionized gas in the intergalactic medium and galaxy halos .",
    "the @xmath141031.92 , 1037.62 doublet has been detected in absorption toward qsos over a wide range of redshifts ( see  1 in tripp & savage 2000 ) .",
    "the lowest redshift absorbers are particularly interesting because the redshifts of galaxies near the qso sight lines can be measured , and the relationship between the absorber properties and environment can be studied .",
    "furthermore , cosmological simulations predict that a substantial fraction of the baryons in the universe are in a shock - heated phase at @xmath15 k at low @xmath16 ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "1999 ) , and preliminary results indicate that low-@xmath16 systems may indeed be an important baryon reservoir ( tripp & savage 2000 ) . in a previous paper , savage , tripp , & lu ( 1998 ) studied an intervening absorber associated with two galaxies at @xmath17 0.225 in the spectrum of the radio - quiet qso h1821 + 643 using a combination of low resolution _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ spectra with broad wavelength coverage and a high resolution _ hst _",
    "spectrum with very limited wavelength coverage .",
    "we have re - observed this qso with an echelle mode of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst _ , which provides a resolution of @xmath17 km s@xmath2  ( fwhm ) with broad wavelength coverage . in this paper",
    "we present in  2 and  3 new results on one probable and four definite absorption line systems in the stis h1821 + 643 spectrum . in ",
    "4 we discuss the implications of the high rate of occurance of absorbers at low redshift .",
    "the direct information we obtain about the highly ionized state of the gas from the presence of allows us to estimate the baryonic content of these systems .",
    "we conclude that systems are likely to harbor an important fraction of the baryons at the present epoch .",
    "h1821 + 643 was observed with stis for 25466 seconds on 1999 june 25 with the medium resolution fuv echelle mode ( e140 m ) and the 0.2@xmath180.06  slit .",
    "this stis mode provides a resolution of @xmath19 46000 or fwhm @xmath20 7 km s@xmath2  ( kimble et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the data were reduced as described by tripp & savage ( 2000 ) including the scattered light correction developed by the stis instrument definition team .",
    "the spectrum extends from @xmath11150 to 1710    with four small gaps between orders at @xmath21 1630  . throughout this paper wavelengths and redshifts",
    "are heliocentric .",
    "we first searched the spectrum for absorbers by checking for lines with the velocity separation and relative line strengths expected for the doublet .",
    "this identified the four definite systems .",
    "we then searched for lines associated with known ly@xmath6  absorbers , and this revealed the probable system ( see below ) .",
    "a selected sample of the spectrum is shown in figure  [ samplespec ] .",
    "this portion of the spectrum shows the doublet at @xmath4  = 0.22497 as well as a much weaker doublet at @xmath4  = 0.22637 .",
    "both of these absorbers are discussed in  3.1 .",
    "in addition to the systems in figure  [ samplespec ] , the stis echelle spectrum shows new absorbers at @xmath4  = 0.24531 and 0.26659 which have small equivalent widths ; these systems are briefly discussed in  3.2 along with a possible system at @xmath4  = 0.21326 . the @xmath4  = 0.21326 system is a strong ly@xmath6/ly@xmath22 absorber with a @xmath23 line detected at the expected wavelength of @xmath241031.93 .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath241037.62 line is blended with milky way @xmath241259.52 absorption due to two high velocity clouds , so we consider this a probable but not definite detection .",
    "the component structure establishes that this blend is mostly due to milky way , but it is possible that an @xmath241037.62 line of the right strength is present as well . in principle",
    "this could be proved by comparing the @xmath241259.52 line strengths to the @xmath251250.58 , 1253.81 line strengths . however",
    ", this does not yield a clear result at the current s / n level due to ambiguity of the continuum placement near 1259  .",
    "restframe equivalent widths ( @xmath26 ) of absorption lines detected in the systems , measured using the software of sembach & savage ( 1992 ) , are listed in table  [ lineprop ] .",
    "note that the quoted errors in equivalent width include contributions from uncertainties in the height and curvature of the continuum as well as a 2% uncertainty in the flux zero point .",
    "integrated apparent column densities ( savage & sembach 1991 ) are also found in table  [ lineprop ] with error bars including contributions from continuum and zero point uncertainties . to measure line widths",
    ", we used the voigt profile fitting software of fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) with the line spread functions from the cycle 9 stis handbook .",
    "four of the five absorption systems in table  [ lineprop ] are within a projected distance of 1 @xmath27 mpc or less of at least one galaxy with @xmath28 300 km s@xmath2 , and some of them are close to multiple galaxies ( see table 1 in tripp et al .",
    "these absorbers are also displaced from the qso redshift by 7100 km s@xmath2  ( @xmath4  = 0.26659 ) to 17100 km s@xmath2  ( @xmath4  = 0.22497 ) . finally , the profiles are relatively narrow . therefore these are probably intervening systems that trace the large - scale gaseous environment in galaxy envelopes and the igm rather than `` intrinsic '' absorbers ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "since the doublets at @xmath4  = 0.22497 and 0.22637 shown in figure  [ samplespec ] are separated by only @xmath1340 km s@xmath2 , they are probably related and we discuss them together .",
    "two emission line galaxies are known at heliocentric redshifts of 0.22560 and 0.22650 at projected distances of 105 and 388 @xmath27 kpc from the sight line km s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 and @xmath29 = 0.0 . ]",
    "( tripp et al .",
    "in addition to the doublet , the stis spectrum shows strong absorption lines due to ly@xmath6  , ly@xmath22 , ly@xmath30 , @xmath241206.5 , and possibly @xmath24977.02 at @xmath4  = 0.22497 ; the absorption profiles of most of these species are plotted on a velocity scale in figure  [ stack22497 ] .",
    "the lines of and are not detected at greater than 3@xmath31 significance , and upper limits on their equivalent widths and column densities are listed in table  [ lineprop ] along with upper limits on and .",
    "figure  [ stack22497 ] provides several indications that these systems are multiphase absorbers .",
    "several components are readily apparent in most of the @xmath4  = 0.22497 profiles including the lines ( see also figure  [ samplespec ] ) .",
    "fitting of the profile yields @xmath32 = 7.7@xmath33 and 1.6@xmath34 km s@xmath2  for the two well - detected components at @xmath35",
    "= 3 and + 25 km s@xmath2 , respectively",
    ". however , the component velocity centroids and @xmath32-values are not compatible with a homogeneous mixture of and .",
    "for example , the profile shows a prominent narrow component at @xmath36 25 km s@xmath2 , and there is no obviously corresponding component in the profiles .",
    "while thermal doppler broadening can make the profiles broader than those of , at most the increase will be a factor of @xmath37 , and this is inadequate to produce the breadth of the observed lines .",
    "thus we are compelled to consider a mixture of phases , some of which show up in , while others are prominent in .    in the case of the at @xmath4  = 0.22637 , which is also visible in figure  [ stack22497 ] , the multiphase nature",
    "is suggested by an offset of 60 km s@xmath2  between the ly@xmath6  and velocity centroids .",
    "also we note that no absorption is significantly detected at the velocity of the suggesting that the hydrogen is thoroughly ionized in the gas",
    ". this absorber may be analogous to the highly ionized high velocity clouds seen near the milky way which show strong high ion absorption with very weak or absent low ion absorption ( sembach et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the two new systems at @xmath4  = 0.24531 and @xmath4  = 0.26659 are plotted in figure  [ weak ] .",
    "a striking feature of these weak absorbers ( and the candidate at @xmath4  = 0.21326 ) is that while their column densities are comparable , the strengths of their corresponding absorption lines are significantly different ( see table  [ lineprop ] and figure  [ weak ] ) . for example , @xmath7()/@xmath7 ( ) = 5.2@xmath38 in the @xmath4  = 0.24531 system while @xmath7()/@xmath7 ( ) = 1.2@xmath39 in the @xmath4  = 0.26659 absorber .",
    "the contrast is even more dramatic with the @xmath4  = 0.21326 absorber , which has @xmath7()/@xmath7 ( ) @xmath8 . for reference , in collisional ionization equilibrium ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) , gas with solar metallicity at the peak ionization temperature should have @xmath7()/@xmath7 ( )",
    "@xmath1 100 .",
    "the large variablility of the observed / ratio could indicate that the metallicity of the absorbers varies substantially , or this could be due to differences in the physical conditions and ionization of the gas .",
    "if , for example , these are multiphase absorbers with the lines arising in a cool phase which is embedded in a hot phase which produces the absorption ( e.g. , mo & miralda - escud 1996 ) , then the wide variations in the / ratio could simply be due to interception of fewer cool phase clouds in one absorber compared to another .",
    "a full analysis of the range of physical conditions of these absorbers will be presented in a later paper .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the ly@xmath6  profile of the @xmath4  = 0.26659 system is rather broad and relatively smooth ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ weak ] ) , which may indicate that this absorber is collisionally ionized and hot .",
    "however , fitting a single component to the @xmath4  = 0.26659 ly@xmath6  profile yields @xmath40 , which implies that @xmath41 k. at this temperature the ionization fraction is rather small in collisional ionization equilibrium ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) , and an unreasonably high metallicity is required to produce the observed @xmath7 ( ) and @xmath7 ( ) in the same gas .",
    "this may be another indication that these are multiphase absorbers or that the gas is not in ionization equilibrium .",
    "the new stis data in this paper provide an opportunity to evaluate the number density of low-@xmath16 absorbers per unit redshift ( @xmath42 ) and a lower limit on their cosmological mass density .",
    "if we neglect continuum placement uncertainty and other systematic error sources , the stis e140 m spectrum of h1821 + 643 is formally adequate for @xmath43 detection of narrow lines with @xmath44 30 m  at @xmath45 1188   ( @xmath4  @xmath46 0.151 for @xmath241031.93 ) . however , the continuum placement ambiguity substantially increases the uncertainty in @xmath26 for weak lines .",
    "moreover , broader resolved lines spread over more pixels have higher limiting equivalent widths ( limiting @xmath47 ) , so broad weak lines may not be detected at the @xmath48 level .",
    "consequently , the @xmath42 derived below should be treated as a lower limit .",
    "we require detection of both lines of the doublet with @xmath44 30 m , and we exclude one absorber  = 0.2967 .",
    "this system is not listed in table  [ lineprop ] but is discussed in detail in savage et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and oegerle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . ] within @xmath49 5000 km s@xmath2  of @xmath0 to avoid contamination of the sample with intrinsic absorbers .",
    "this results in a sample of three systems  = 0.22497 , 0.24531 , and 0.26659 .",
    "we exclude the probable system at @xmath4  = 0.21326 , and the @xmath4  = 0.22637 system falls below the equivalent width threshold . ] over a redshift path of @xmath50 = 0.063 ( after correction for a loss of @xmath50 = 0.061 for spectral regions in which either of the lines is blocked by ism or extragalactic lines from other redshifts ) . therefore the most probable @xmath51 48 for @xmath44 30 m  and 0.15 @xmath52 @xmath4  @xmath52 0.27 , and",
    "we conservatively conclude that @xmath53 17 at the 90% confidence level ( following the gehrels 1986 treatment for small sample statistics ) .",
    "this is a remarkably high number density .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the sample is extremely small and , since very little is known about _",
    "weak _ lines at low redshift , it remains possible that @xmath42 is unusually high toward h1821 + 643 for some reason .",
    "however , there is supporting evidence that @xmath42 is generally high : ( 1 ) a similar @xmath42 is derived from stis echelle spectroscopy of pg0953 + 415 ( tripp & savage 2000 ) , and ( 2 ) one or two additional intervening absorbers are evident in the h1821 + 643 spectrum which did not satisfy the selection criteria to be included in the sample .",
    "more observations are needed to build the sample of weak lines at low @xmath16 .    for comparison , low to moderate redshift absorbers with @xmath44 20 m  have @xmath54 ( churchill et al .",
    "1999 ; see also tripp , lu , & savage 1997 ) .",
    "the _ stronger _ absorbers are less common ; burles & tytler ( 1996 ) report @xmath55 for systems with @xmath44 210 m  at @xmath56 = 0.9 . evidently , the @xmath42 of the weak lines is substantially larger than @xmath42 of other known classes of low @xmath16 metal absorbers and is more comparable to that of low @xmath16 weak ly@xmath6  absorbers , which have @xmath11 100 for @xmath44 50 m  ( tripp et al . 1998 ; penton et al .",
    "2000 ) .    following analogous calculations ( e.g. , storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1996 ; burles & tytler 1996 ) , the mean cosmological mass density in the absorbers , in units of the current critical density @xmath57 , can be estimated using @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mean atomic weight ( taken to be 1.3 ) , @xmath60 ( ) is a representative ionization fraction , ( o / h)@xmath61 is the assumed mean oxygen abundance by number in the absorbers , @xmath62 ( ) is the total column density from the @xmath63 absorbers , and @xmath64 is the absorption distance interval ( bahcall & peebles 1969 ) , corrected for blocked spectral regions . with the sample defined above , we have @xmath65 } h_{75 } ^{-1 } $ ] where [ o / h ] = log ( o / h ) - log ( o / h)@xmath66 . to set a conservative lower limit on @xmath67 ( ) , we assume [ o / h ] = @xmath680.3 and @xmath60 ( ) = 0.2 ( which is close to the maximum value in photo- or collisional ionization , see tripp & savage 2000 ) , which yields @xmath67 ( ) @xmath69 .",
    "if we set the mean metallicity to a more realistic value such as [ o / h ] = @xmath681 , @xmath67 ( ) increases to @xmath70 .",
    "similar lower limits on @xmath67 ( ) have been derived by tripp & savage ( 2000 ) using a slightly less sensitive sample based on stis echelle spectroscopy of pg0953 + 415 and earlier goddard high resolution spectrograph observations of h1821 + 643 .",
    "the lower limit assuming ( o / h ) = 1/10 solar is comparable to the combined cosmological mass density of stars , cool neutral gas , and x - ray emitting cluster gas at low redshift , @xmath71 0.006 ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "though still uncertain due to the small sample,(o vi ) estimates , see tripp & savage ( 2000 ) . ]",
    "small redshift path probed , and uncertain ( o / h)@xmath61 , these preliminary lower limits on @xmath67 ( ) suggest that absorbers contain an important fraction of the baryons in the low redshift universe .",
