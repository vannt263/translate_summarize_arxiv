    "there is a general quest for understanding of complicated phenomena in terms of a limited set of degrees of freedom , chosen through some method appropriate for the problem at hand .",
    "many approaches are available , in areas ranging from field theories to atomic physics ( see , e.g. , the reviews in ref .",
    "these are typically based on the concept of `` relevant degrees of freedom '' , or on the introduction of collective motion and collective paths  which are two ways to express rather similar principles !    more specific to the nuclear problem studied in this paper ,",
    "the old question `` what is the correct choice of collective coordinate in a many - body system '' has had quite a few partial answers , see the review  @xcite for a discussion of some of these .",
    "the holy grail of this approach is a method that determines a collective path self - consistently , based only on knowledge of the hamiltonian governing the system .",
    "preferably the method chosen should allow us to measure whether the limited dynamics in a few coordinates makes sense at all , or in the language used above , address the question `` how effective are the effective degrees of freedom ? '' .",
    "the constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov method is commonly used to describe collective paths in nuclear physics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this approach , where the collective subspace is generated by a small number of one - body constraints , also goes by the name of generalised cranking .",
    "the one - body constraints usually consist of a few carefully chosen multipole ( particle - hole ) operators , as well as a few generalised pairing ( particle - particle ) ones . for large scale realistic problems such as the description of nuclear fission the number of generalised cranking operators needed in order to make",
    "a realistic calculation becomes very large .",
    "there is also no reason to limit the constraints to the standard choices ; other degrees of freedom , especially those involving spin - orbit interactions might also be important .",
    "a more satisfactory method should allow the cranking operators to be determined by the nuclear collective dynamics itself .",
    "one such approach , followed in this paper and set out in detail in the review paper  @xcite ( a similar approach , plus relevant references , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , leads to a very well - defined approach , which can in principle be solved knowing the hamiltonian and model space . to find the adiabatic collective path we use the local harmonic approximation ( lha ) .",
    "it consists of a constrained mean - field problem that needs to be solved together with a local random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which determines the constraining operator .",
    "this approach lacks practicality , since the size of the rpa problem is , for a system with pairing , proportional to the size of the single - particle space squared .",
    "even though enormous matrices can routinely be diagonalised on modern computer systems , the algorithm requires repeated diagonalisation of such a matrix , which makes an implementation in realistic calculations prohibitively time consuming .",
    "this requires a solution , or at least a good approximation , and this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "a first approach to solving the problem has been suggested in the work of one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "the best way to test such ideas is to use a semi - realistic model , where approximations can be tested against the full method , such as the pairing - plus - quadrupole model as employed by barranger and kumar  @xcite in their seminal work .",
    "it has been shown in the past  @xcite that at equilibrium the rpa can be solved quite efficiently using a simple basis of operators .",
    "related work by nesterenko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite may also have some bearing on this problem , but will not be investigated here . in short ,",
    "the idea is that the basic operators of the model , weighted by a suitable power of the quasi - particle energies , give excellent results .",
    "the state dependence induced by the quasi - particle energies is crucial to the success of the approach , and is the main difference with methods based on `` naive '' constraints .",
    "since the original work was only done at equilibrium , we must still check that such a basis of operators provides a good solution along the collective path , and we indeed find some important modifications to the method discussed in  @xcite .",
    "once a collective path has been found we can diagonalise the collective one - body hamiltonian along this path , including all the zero modes arising from broken symmetries .",
    "this will give information on how the collective motion influences the ground state properties of the nuclei .",
    "in several of the examples discussed below we find low lying states with pairing collapse which influence the collective behaviour of the system .",
    "if we now quantise the collective dynamics , we _ must _ include the pairing rotations .",
    "this is due to the fact that a point with collapsed pairing behaves similarly to the origin in polar coordinates , with the pairing phase playing the role of the polar angle . in this work we shall only study the effect of the pairing - rotational modes , ignoring collective rotation for the time being .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we briefly present the basic principles of our approach , to highlight those issues that will make the results easier to understand .",
    "the practical form of the equations for the type of many - body problem considered here is also discussed , and the form of the approximation is introduced .",
    "results are then given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and finally we draw some conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the formalism , as set out in detail in  @xcite , is based on time - dependent mean field theory , and the fact that a classical dynamics can be associated with it .",
    "the issue of selecting collective coordinates , and determining their coupling to other degrees of freedom , thus becomes an exercise in classical mechanics .",
    "furthermore , if we assume adiabaticity , a slow motion where the hamiltonian can be expanded to second order in momenta , we have a problem that can be solved .",
    "the solution can be stated without any direct reference to the original nuclear many - body problem and the choice of the interaction .",
    "we assume a classical hamiltonian depending on a set of real canonical coordinates , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , and conjugate momenta , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , of the form ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 thus parametrise @xmath6 @xcite ) @xmath7 we shall use a tensor notation , where we use upper indices for coordinates and lower indices for momenta .",
    "when the same symbol appears as both upper and lower index there is an implicit sum over that index .",
    "the potential @xmath8 and the mass matrix @xmath9 are given by an expansion of @xmath10 in powers of @xmath5 in zeroth and second order , respectively , @xmath11 terms of higher order ( such as @xmath12 ) are supposed to be negligible .",
    "the kinetic energy in the lagrangian formalism contains the inverse @xmath13 of the mass matrix , @xmath14 , and can be interpreted as an inner - product in the tangent space to a curved manifold .",
    "the inverse of the mass matrix @xmath9 , is thus the metric tensor ; in other words the matrix @xmath13 represents the riemanian geometry in configuration space , since it measures lengths in the tangent space .",
    "this clearly would not be the case if we had higher order terms in the kinetic energy .",
    "the central part in our approach to large amplitude motion is a search for collective ( and non - collective ) coordinates @xmath15 which are obtained by an invertible point transformation of the original coordinates @xmath0 , preserving the quadratic truncation of the momentum dependence of the hamiltonian  , by @xmath16 and the corresponding transformation relations for the momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 where we use a standard notation for the derivatives , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the adiabatic hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2 ] ) , is then transformed into @xmath22 in the new coordinates .",
    "the new coordinates @xmath15 are now to be divided into three categories : the collective coordinate @xmath23 , the zero - mode coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which describe motions that do not change the energies and finally the non - collective coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 . [",
    "the approach can easily be generalised to include more than one collective coordinate , but that will not be discussed here . ]",
    "the collective coordinate is determined by means of the solution to the local harmonic approach , which consists of a set of self - consistent equations .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "the force equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the zero - modes ( also called nambu - goldstone or spurious modes ) and @xmath30 represents a set of lagrange multipliers ( which in nuclear physics are usually called cranking parameters ) .",
    "@xmath31 is a lagrange multiplier for the collective mode , stabilising the system away from equilibrium ( we shall often denote it as the generalised cranking parameter ) .",
    "the local rpa equation @xmath32 where the covariant derivative @xmath33 is defined in the usual way ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 zero modes correspond to zero eigenvalues of the rpa . in principle",
    "great care needs to be taken to have zero modes behave correctly away from equilibrium .",
    "the symplectic rpa  @xcite is the correct way to do so ; unfortunately it is rather cumbersome , and as a practical approximation we shall ignore the corrections arising from this approach here . in this paper we will also neglect the covariant corrections to the rpa , since they are time - consuming to calculate .",
    "this means that we do not treat the zero - modes absolutely correctly .",
    "the collective path is found by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : force1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : localrpa1 ] ) self - consistently , i.e. , we look for a path consisting of a series of points where the lowest non - spurious eigenvector of the local rpa equations also fulfils the force condition . in the minimum of the potential the spurious solutions decouples from the other collective and non - collective solutions .",
    "when we are following the collective path away from the minimum one can use special techniques , called the symplectic version of the theory , to avoid mixing of the spurious solution and the physical solutions  @xcite .",
    "this has the disadvantage that it is numerically much more difficult to implement . in this paper",
    "we have chosen to ignore the effects of the spurious admixtures to the rpa wave - functions , but these are expected to be small , at least close to the minimum . as a result there will be a finite overlap between the collective coordinate and the spurious operators .",
    "the price paid for these approximations is that at points where rpa frequencies should cross we get narrow avoided crossings .",
    "the narrowness is a measure of the severity of the truncation errors .",
    "one way to by - pass such problems , is to use a basis of operators , where such crossings are extremely rare .",
    "the local harmonic approximation has been described in  @xcite . there",
    "the structure is discussed in great detail , as is the transition between nuclear physics and classical mechanics . here",
    "the formalism is extended to include pairing and constraints on particle number .",
    "we start with the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations ; in this case one finds that a natural choice for the coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the real and imaginary parts of the generalised density matrix in its locally diagonal form  , where the change in the pairing density , @xmath36 , can be parametrised as  @xcite @xmath37    we want to find a solution of the local rpa equation , @xmath38 , at the generalised density @xmath39 satisfying the generalised cranking equation ( [ eq : force1 ] ) @xmath40_{q q ' } - \\lambda f^{\\text{new}}_{q q ' } -       \\sum_{\\tau = n , p } \\mu n^{\\text{new}}_{\\tau\\,q q'}= 0 ,      \\label{eq : cranking1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is also an eigenvector of the rpa equation  ( [ eq : localrpa1 ] ) at @xmath39 and @xmath41 are the particle number operators for neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath42 at the previous point as input , and try to find a point a fixed length @xmath43 further along the path , that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : cranking1 ] ) for the `` old '' value of @xmath42 .",
    "subsequently , a new @xmath42 is found by solving the rpa equations , and this procedure is repeated until eqs .",

    "the initial values @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the results obtained at the previous self - consistent point on the collective path .",
    "@xmath43 is a measure of the step length in the collective coordinate and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dq1 ] ) is actually a linear approximation to the integral definition of the change in collective coordinate @xmath49 the value of @xmath43 depends on the normalisation of @xmath42 . in the following",
    "we choose the normalisation in such a way that the collective mass , @xmath50 , is position independent , @xmath51 equation  ( [ eq : cranking2 ] ) is solved iteratively by a constrained minimisation , where the change of the generalised density in the @xmath52th step of the mean - field iteration is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the step length in the mean - field iteration @xmath55 is chosen to be small for small @xmath52 , to make sure that the iterations converge , but can be chosen larger as the iteration approaches the minimum of the constrained mean - field .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are calculated from the set of conditions discussed below . for each @xmath60",
    "the @xmath52-iteration is initiated by choosing @xmath61    there are two types of constraints that give the undetermined parameters in the method described above : the fixed size of the steps in the collective coordinate  ( [ eq : dq1 ] ) and the constraint on particle number .",
    "the particle numbers are constrained by requiring that @xmath62 does not change the expectation values @xmath63 .",
    "such a constraint can be written in differential form as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "we also have to constrain @xmath66 in a similar way @xmath67 the six conditions ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : drn1][eq : drn2 ] ) ) give a set of equations which can be solved for the six parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for each @xmath52 and @xmath60 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath72 can be found in the appendix .",
    "the quality of the collective coordinate found above can be quantified and calculated .",
    "this is done by calculating the decoupling measure , @xmath73 , derived in  @xcite .",
    "one way of calculating @xmath73 is by computing the inverse mass matrix @xmath74 and then calculate @xmath75 where we can approximate the derivative by the finite differences @xmath76 the decoupling measure is then calculated to be @xmath77 where we have uses the normalisation eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmass ] ) .",
    "this quantity is straightforward to evaluate , but it is easier to understand from an alternative expression for @xmath73 , which is based on the generalisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dq1 ] ) to all coordinates @xmath78 this leads to @xmath79 i.e. , @xmath73 is the sum of squares of the change of the non - collective coordinates with the collective coordinate .",
    "this is clearly zero for exact decoupling .",
    "one of the main difficulties of applying the lha method to realistic nuclear problems is the effort required in diagonalising the large - dimensional rpa matrix repeatedly within the double iterative process . to limit the computational effort we use the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to reduce the size of the rpa matrix .",
    "there it was shown that the rpa equation can be solved with good accuracy by assuming that the rpa eigenvectors can be described as a linear combination of a small number of state - dependent one - body operators . the quality of the results , and the number of operators needed depends strongly on the choice of the set of operators .",
    "how to choose these operators is a longstanding problem in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "we select a small number of one - body operators @xmath80 , @xmath81 , assuming that the rpa eigenvectors can be approximated as linear combinations of the @xmath80 .",
    "the approximate rpa vector @xmath82 is then given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the expectation value of @xmath80 .",
    "to determine the coefficients @xmath85 the rpa matrices are projected onto the subspace @xmath86 : @xmath87 the rpa equation can then be expressed as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a eigenfrequency of the projected rpa .",
    "the rank of the matrix we need to diagonalise to solve the rpa problem has been reduced from the number of 2-quasi - particle degrees of freedom to the number of one - body operators chosen .",
    "after having made a semi - classical approximation , which leads to a classical hamiltonian , we need to remember that we are studying a quantum system .",
    "the standard technique to deal with this is to treat the classical hamiltonian as a quantum one , and to calculate the eigenfunctions and energies .",
    "this is superficially similar to the generator coordinate method , especially in the gaussian overlap approximation @xcite , but it is actually rather different . the key point is the appearance of the kinetic terms , which correspond to time - odd generator coordinates ( usually not include in the gcm ) .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can include all manner of quantum corrections to the potential energy , especially if we are interested in _ absolute _ values of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "on the other hand , shape mixing  a spread of the wave function along the collective path  is rather insensitive to these quantum corrections .",
    "therefore , we shall consider the hamiltonian along the collective path without further quantum corrections .",
    "one must include the zero modes when quantising the hamiltonian , since they describe rotational and other excitations .",
    "quantisation of the hamiltonian in a metric coordinate space turns the kinetic energy into a laplace - beltrami operator ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the relevant space , @xmath90 the collective schrdinger equation can then be written as @xmath91 in this paper we discuss calculations with one true collective coordinate , and a number of additional momenta for the zero modes ( denoted as @xmath92 ) : two or three angular momenta , depending on whether the state is axial or not , and two operators connected to a change of phase of the proton and neutron pairing gap , associated with pairing rotation .",
    "these latter quantise as @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the potential @xmath95 is invariant under all the zero - modes , and only depends on the collective parameter , @xmath96 the laplace - beltrami operator , @xmath97 , with variable ( but diagonal ) mass matrix , where the zero - mode masses are given by @xmath98 , can then be written as @xmath99 where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is identical to @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cmass ] ) , and thus equals 1 .",
    "below we shall write @xmath103 for the neutron and proton pairing - rotational masses .",
    "these are calculated as @xmath104 and the rotational moments of inertia are defined in the usual way .",
    "since the potential and the masses are independent of the zero - mode coordinates the wave - function @xmath105 can be separated into various pieces , @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the quantum numbers for neutron and proton pairing rotation , and @xmath109 are the usual rotator quantum numbers .",
    "we shall be looking at ground states ( bandheads ) only , and therefore we shall now use @xmath110 , and since pairing rotational excitation corresponds to a change in particle number , we shall be use @xmath111 as well .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lb1 ] ) acting on @xmath105 can now be rewritten as @xmath112 here we see the typical reason to absorb the factor @xmath113 into the wave function : it removes the linear derivative term , and we obtain a `` centrifugal '' potential in its place .",
    "this is fully consistent with the standard procedure for separation of variables in radially symmetric problems in two and three dimensions as can be found in any quantum mechanics textbook . using ( [ eq : wf1 ] )",
    "to separate variables , the schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : se1 ] ) can be written as @xmath114    since we wish the wave function @xmath105 to be normalisable we require it to be finite , and we must then insist that @xmath115 goes to zero when @xmath116 does . in the present work that only occurs when either of the pairing gaps collapses and",
    "thus @xmath117 is zero , and we shall ignore the rotational moments of inertia , which do not change very quickly . below we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : se2 ] ) on a grid with the boundary condition that @xmath118 . at points where @xmath119 the condition @xmath120 holds exactly ; for other cases applying this boundary condition will only give an upper limit on energy .",
    "the scaling of the wave - function removes @xmath116 from expectation values , and the expectation value of any local operator @xmath121 can evaluated as @xmath122 which shows that @xmath123 must be normalised according to @xmath124",
    "to test the projection basis discussed in section  [ sec : plha ] we implement our method for a interaction and configuration space that where the approximation can be compared with exact results .",

    "these avoided crossings also show that more then one collective coordinate would be needed for a accurate description of the collective motion . in the @xmath146-soft nucleus",
    "@xmath220gd the collective coordinate is of a more complicated structure which can also be seen in the non - harmonic shape of the potential energy .",
    "our projected local rpa method for calculating the collective path gives very good agreement with the results obtained using the full rpa .",
    "the method is very useful when calculating self - consistent large amplitude collective motion in large a configuration space .    by solving the one - dimensional `` radial '' schrdinger equation along the collective path",
    "we are able to examine the effect of the collective motion on ground state properties . in cases where the collective path ends with a collapse of the pair field",
    "we must include the effect of pairing rotations on the low energy spectrum .",
    "it is surprising that almost all our calculations are dominated by states with collapsing pairing ; there may well be important lessons in this feature .",
    "the reason they occur so frequently is the presence of low - lying configurations without pairing .",
    "one might ask whether this is an artifact of our model , and whether larger configuration - spaces with more complicated interactions would behave differently .",
    "such calculations are clearly called for , but we do not expect dramatically different results , since pairing mainly acts in a small region around the fermi - surface .",
    "there is also a slight possibility that the approximations we made in our treatment of spurious admixtures contributes to these effects .",
    "the surprising importance of the pairing collapse is the main result of our calculations that is usually not seen in a standard constrained mean - field calculation .    in this paper",
    "we have implemented a method to find the adiabatic self - consistent collective path for a nuclei . a technique to truncate the basis in which the rpa equations are solved has been improved and a good agreement between the full and truncated rpa is found . to solve the rpa equations in a limited basis",
    "has proven to be a useful and practical way of calculating the collective path within the local harmonic approximation .",
    "we intend to apply similar techniques to the interesting problem of collective motion at finite rotational frequency in the near future .",
    "it remains to be investigated how we can include the covariant terms in the rpa in a suitable approximation .",
    "this work was supported by the uk engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) under grant gr / n15672 .",
    "the six conditions ( eqs .  ( [ eq : dq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : drn1][eq : drn2 ] ) ) gives a set of equations which can be solved for the six parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for each @xmath52 and @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath229 we get @xmath230 for all other @xmath52 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : drni1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : drni2 ] ) together with the constraints  ( [ eq : dq1][eq : drn2 ] ) give @xmath231 these equations can easily be generalised to incorporate additional constraint operators like angular momentum .",
    "they are slightly more complicated than those shown in other work  @xcite , since we have chosen to fix the step size in the collective coordinate .",
