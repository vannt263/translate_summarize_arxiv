    "this critical velocity @xmath191 is equal to the bogoliubov speed of sound @xmath192 in all directions . in a pdbec",
    ", the anisotropic quasiparticle dispersion relation leads directly to the prediction of an anisotropic superfluid critical velocity , and to the possibility of a critical velocity lower than that of the unperturbed condensate .",

    "the scattering probability for impurity atoms ( related to the viscosity of the fluid ) is indeed non - zero at velocities lower than the superfluid critical velocity for the unperturbed gas , demonstrating that the critical velocity is suppressed along the direction of raman scattering .",
    "this scattering at low velocities occurs through the excitation of quasiparticles near the local minimum ( the `` artificial roton '' ) in the lower dispersion relation .",
    "however , this scattering channel is weak for small values of the rabi frequency @xmath36 , and thus the scattering strength @xmath197 remains weak until the curve joins that of the uncoupled condensate and the scattering strength is increased by phonon scattering .",
    "the effects of increasing the rabi frequency are twofold .",
    "first , as @xmath36 increases , the internal state composition of the `` artificial roton '' excitation becomes more similar to the internal state composition of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this causes an increase in the scattering strength ( as indicated also in the calculations of @xmath134 shown in figures [ fig : smuandspivarymu ] and [ fig : smuandspivaryrabi ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , because of this overlap of the internal state composition , the energy of these excitations is increased , approaching the energy given by the one - component bogoliubov spectrum , albeit with an appropriately modified effective mass .",

    "<S> one experiment at jila explored how a spatially - selective coupling between two trapped hyperfine levels of a rubidium condensate leads to a `` winding '' of the order parameter , akin to the phase winding of the order parameter which occurs due to rotation about a vortex core , and how this winding is recurrently `` undone '' due to the motional dynamics of a two - component condensate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation illustrates that vortices in such a novel system should not be metastable ( similarly predicted for spinor condensates @xcite ) , a major modification from the superfluid behaviour of a single component gas .    in a similar vein </S>",
    "<S> , we have previously considered the novel superfluid properties introduced to a two - component bose condensed atomic gas which is coupled by a spatially periodic coupling field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this spatially - periodic coupling results from intersecting , non - collinear laser beams which induce a raman coupling between two internal states of the ultracold gas . </S>",
    "<S> the raman coupling introduces an anisotropy to this periodically - dressed fluid which should manifest itself in an anisotropic superfluid critical velocity . </S>",
    "<S> controlling various parameters of the raman coupling laser beams allows one to dramatically alter this critical velocity , leading to the dissipation of superfluid flow at velocities much lower than the critical velocity for the uncoupled bose condensate .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop further a theory describing the dissipation of superfluid flow in a periodically - dressed bose - einstein condensate . using the bogolibov approximation theory which was introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the possible disspation of superfluid flow is treated by analyzing the scattering of massive impurities which flow through the superfluid . in analogy with similar calculations for a scalar bose - einstein condensate @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , impurity scattering at low impurity velocities is found to be suppressed by the energetics of the quasi - particle spectrum ( related to the landau criterion for superfluidity @xcite ) , by the suppression of density fluctuations in the low - momentum phonon regime @xcite , and by variations of the internal - state compositions of quasiparticles at different wavevectors . </S>",
    "<S> these effects combine to give a smooth evolution in the disspation rates for superfluid flow as the raman coupling strength is increased , gradually converting an uncoupled two component bose - einstein condensate ( essentially a scalar superfluid ) to a periodically - dressed condensate with dramatically different superfluid properties . </S>",
    "<S> this superfluid dissipation rate gives an appealingly clear signature for future experimental studies . </S>"
