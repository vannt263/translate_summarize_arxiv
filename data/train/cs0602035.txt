    "description coding ( mdc ) aims at creating separate descriptions individually capable of reproducing a source to a specified accuracy and when combined being able to refine each other .",
    "the classical scheme involves two descriptions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : twochannel ] .",
    "the total rate @xmath1 is split between the two descriptions , i.e.  @xmath2 , and the distortion observed at the receiver depends on which descriptions arrive . if both descriptions are received , the distortion @xmath3 is lower than if only a single description is received ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "existing mdc schemes can roughly be divided into three categories : quantizer - based , transform - based and source - channel erasure codes based .",
    "quantizer - based schemes include scalar quantization  @xcite , trellis coded quantization  @xcite and vector quantization  @xcite .",
    "transform - based approaches include correlating transforms  @xcite and overcomplete expansions  @xcite .",
    "recently , schemes based on source - channel erasure codes have been introduced  @xcite .",
    "for further details on many existing mdc techniques we refer to the survey article by goyal  @xcite .",
    "the present work is based on lattice vector quantization and belongs therefore to the first of the categories mentioned above .    the achievable rate - distortion ( r - d ) region for the two - channel problem with respect to the gaussian source and mean - square error fidelity criterion has been known for at least two decades  @xcite .",
    "the procedures leading to the achievable region were however non - constructive , and the puzzle of designing a system capable of achieving the performance promised by theory remained unsolved . in 1993 vaishampayan designed a practical mdc scheme for the scalar case  @xcite .",
    "the idea was to quantize the source by a central quantizer and then apply an index - assignment algorithm that uniquely mapped all reconstruction points of the central quantizer to reconstruction points in two side quantizers , thereby obtaining two coarser descriptions of the source . if both descriptions were received , the inverse map was applied and the performance of the central quantizer was achieved , whereas if only one of the descriptions was received the source was reproduced at the resolution of one of the side quantizers .",
    "the scheme developed in  @xcite was , however , @xmath6 db from the lower bound on the mdc distortion product for gaussian sources  @xcite .",
    "later , vaishampayan et  al .  described an entropy - constrained multiple - description scalar quantization system  @xcite that , under high - resolution assumptions , is @xmath7 db from the lower bound  @xcite .",
    "recently , practical schemes for two descriptions have been introduced  @xcite , that in the limit of infinite - dimensional source vectors approach the lower bound .",
    "similar to @xcite , these schemes exploit the idea of having only one central quantizer followed by an index - assignment algorithm that maps each central quantizer reconstruction point to pairs of side quantizer reconstruction points .",
    "the quantizers used in  @xcite are all lattice vector quantizers .",
    "it is common to distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric mdc . in the symmetric case",
    "the entropies of the side descriptions are equal and the distortions of the side descriptions are also equal whereas in the asymmetric case entropies and distortions are allowed to be unequal .",
    "multiple - description lattice vector quantization ( md - lvq ) for the symmetric case was first considered in  @xcite where for given target entropies of the side descriptions @xmath8 as well as maximum allowable distortions @xmath9 of the side descriptions the central distortion @xmath10 is minimized .",
    "it is shown that exploiting the structure in lattices makes it possible to consider only a limited region of the lattices , which makes the solution computationally feasible without sacrificing optimality .",
    "a key observation in  @xcite is that the side distortions depend on the scaling of the lattices but are independent of the specific types of lattices .",
    "in fact the side distortions can be expressed through the normalized second moment of a sphere .",
    "asymmetric md - lvq is presented in  @xcite where the central distortion @xmath10 is minimized for given target entropies @xmath11 and maximum allowable side distortions @xmath12 .",
    "a property of all the schemes presented in  @xcite is that a simple scaling of the lattices allows adaptation to changes in target entropies without the need of any iterative training procedures . in @xcite",
    "it is observed that the scheme developed in  @xcite is not able to continuously trade off central distortion versus side distortions .",
    "however , using non - lattices obtained by slightly modifying the lattices in  @xcite in an iterative fashion that alternates between optimizing the encoder while keeping the decoder fixed and optimizing the decoder while keeping the encoder fixed , it is possible to obtain a continuous range of redundancies .",
    "the problem of achieving a continuous range of redundancies is treated in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "the schemes mentioned above all consider two descriptions and the extension to more than two descriptions is not straightforward .",
    "state - of - the - art schemes for more than two descriptions are based on source - channel erasure codes  @xcite which are fundamentally different from the quantizer - based approaches considered above .",
    "schemes based on source - channel erasure codes rely upon the assumption that at least @xmath13 out of @xmath14 descriptions are received , for some pre - specified @xmath13 .",
    "if less than @xmath13 descriptions are received , the quality of the reconstructed source is poor and if @xmath13 or more descriptions are received a good quality can be achieved . among the few quantizer - based approaches which consider more than two descriptions are  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a special case of the general @xmath0-channel symmetric multiple - description problem where only a single parameter controls the redundancy tradeoffs between the central and the side distortions . with a single controling parameter it is possible to describe the entire symmetric r - d region for two descriptions as shown in  @xcite but it is not enough to describe the symmetric achievable @xmath0-channel r - d region .",
    "as such the proposed scheme offer a partial solution to the problem of designing balanced md - lvq systems .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the central and side quantizers which , under high - resolutions assumptions , minimize the _ expected distortion _ at the receiving side subject to entropy constraints on the side descriptions for given packet - loss probabilities .",
    "the central and side quantizers we use are lattice vector quantizers as presented in @xcite .",
    "the central distortion , in our scheme , depends upon the lattice in question whereas the side distortions only depend on the scaling of the lattices but are independent of the specific types of lattices . in the case of three descriptions",
    "we show that the side distortions can be expressed through the normalized second moment of a sphere as was the case for the two descriptions system presented in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that this is true in the general case of an arbitrary number of descriptions .",
    "while state - of - the - art quantizer - based mdc schemes  @xcite mainly deal with only two descriptions , we construct balanced quantizers for an _ arbitrary _ number of descriptions . in the presented approach the expected distortion observed at the receiving side",
    "depends only upon the number of received descriptions , hence the descriptions are mutually refinable and reception of any @xmath13 out of @xmath14 descriptions yields equivalent expected distortion .",
    "this is different from successive refinement schemes  @xcite where the individual descriptions often must be received in a prescribed order to be able to refine each other , i.e.  description number @xmath15 will not do any good unless descriptions @xmath16 have already been received .",
    "we construct a scheme which for given packet - loss probabilities and a maximum bit budget ( target entropy ) determines the optimal number of descriptions and specifies the quantizers that minimize the expected distortion .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] we briefly review specific lattice properties and introduce the concept of an index - assignment algorithm .",
    "the actual design of the index - assignment algorithm is deferred to section  [ sec : label ] .",
    "reconstruction of the source and optimal construction of the labeling function is also presented in section  [ sec : label ] . in section",
    "[ sec : highrate ] we present a high - resolution analysis of the expected distortion .",
    "we describe how to construct the quantizers in section  [ sec : construction ] and numerical evaluation follows in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "appendices contain proofs of theorems .",
    "in this work we use lattices as vector quantizers . for a general treatment of quantizers based on lattices , see  @xcite .",

    "notice that two @xmath14-tuples which are translates of each other by some @xmath65 must not both be assigned to central lattice points located within the same region @xmath85 , since this causes assignment of the same @xmath14-tuples to multiple central lattice points .",
