    "the last couple of years have witnessed the birth and explosive development of a new research area , namely quantum biology . for many years the possibility of non - trivial quantum effects in biological systems was thought to be impossible due to the large amount of noise that characterize such systems . during the last few years however , very surprisingly , a host of experimental and theoretical works have pointed to the possible presence of such effects .",
    "notable results concern the existence of quantum coherence in photosynthesis @xcite and quantum effects in the so called `` chemical compass '' @xcite .    of particular interest is the possible existence of non - trivial entanglement in biological systems .",
    "the reason is that entanglement has dramatic effects , in particular it leads to a vastly increased capacity of information processing .",
    "indeed , entanglement is at the core of quantum computation .",
    "the capacity of quantum systems to perform many other tasks is also significantly increased by entanglement . given these benefits",
    "it is very tempting to suspect that biological systems may make use of entanglement . on the other hand , the existence of entanglement in biological systems",
    "was thought to be even more unlikely than that of mere quantum coherence because entanglement is extremely fragile and almost impossible to survive in the presence of noise .",
    "very recently , however , it was realized @xcite that the intuition about the fragility of entanglement was based on considering the behavior of quantum systems at thermal equilibrium .",
    "biological systems , however , are not at equilibrium - they are open driven systems , far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "such systems are capable of `` error correction '' and may actively maintain entanglement in presence of noise .",
    "this raises the possibility that non - trivial entanglement may actually be present in biological systems .    in @xcite",
    "a simple mechanism was presented by which a molecule subjected to forced oscillations , out of thermal equilibrium , can maintain quantum entanglement between two of its quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "crucially , entanglement can be maintained even in the presence of very intense noise , so intense that no entanglement is possible when the forced oscillations cease .",
    "a potential biological system in which such an effect may take place is that of complex molecules ( such as proteins ) undergoing forced conformational changes . at present , no such system has been experimentally observed , for the simple reason that no experiment has yet been carried out to look for it . to be able to do that it is imperative to first gain a better theoretical understanding of the model",
    "this is the scope of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ tdhamiltonian ] we present the abstract model of a moving `` two - spin molecule '' with time - dependent coherent hamiltonian ; then we investigate the system behavior and the entanglement dynamics under the influence of two distinct environments : in section [ bosonicbath ] we consider a bosonic heat bath representative of a large number of harmonic oscillators , and study its influence both in the markovian and non - markovian regime . to relax the working assumption of periodic oscillations , we further introduce stochasticity in the classical motion of the molecule , and include an additional source of noise to illustrate the robustness of the entanglement generation .",
    "in section [ spingas ] we extend our study to the spin gas model .",
    "the final section [ conclusion ] is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "in the following , we consider bio - molecular systems that undergo controlled conformational changes , using a semi - quantal picture .",
    "we assume that the conformational motion of the molecular structure can be described , to a very good approximation , classically .",
    "in addition , however , we identify selected quantum degrees of freedom , embedded in this `` backbone structure '' and localized at several classically defined sites , which interact with a strength dependent on their distance ( see fig .",
    "( [ allostericdevice ] ) .        in the following ,",
    "we consider two quantum degrees of freedom which are forced to move along some predetermined trajectories and interact via dipolar coupling .",
    "each of these degrees of freedom shall be represented by a quantum mechanical two - level system . for easy reference ,",
    "we call such a model system , a `` two - spin molecule '' @xcite . it can be regarded as an elementary example of a molecular machine which , as we shall see , is able to persistently generate entanglement . as such",
    ", it also presents a building block which could be exploited in more complex bio - molecular motors .     and the background field @xmath0 are position dependent .",
    "( fig . taken from @xcite),width=302 ]    in more detail ,",
    "the mechanism is described as follows : the conformational changes in the molecule force the two localized spins ( or , more generally , two - level systems ) to come close or move apart , inducing an effective time - dependent coupling , both between the two spins and between each spin and a local field , as described in fig .",
    "( [ conf ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it will be assumed ( this is essential ) that the de - coherent environment is so noisy that no static entanglement between the two spins can exist in the static steady state , which is achieved when the molecular configuration is fixed to any of the possible ones .",
    "as we shall see in the following , if the molecular configuration oscillates in a periodic way , cyclic generation of fresh entanglement can persist even in the long time limit .",
    "this feature will persist even in the presence of an additional source of dephasing , which would generally eliminate all coherence from the system .",
    "finally , we shall generalize these considerations to more realistic scenarios involving non - markovian environments and stochasticity in the classical motion .",
    "in the following , whenever we refer to spins , we may imagine spin-@xmath1 magnetic moments interacting via a dipolar coupling and subjected to a background magnetic field . to perform our study",
    ", we further assume that the two spins are coupled with the usual ising type interaction which depends only on the distance @xmath2 between the spins , and that there exists a local magnetic field which induces a ( zeeman ) energy level splitting .",
    "the energy splitting is also assumed to depend only on the inter - spin distance @xmath2 , which thus plays the role of an effective parameter for the overall molecular configuration .",
    "explicitly , the hamiltonian for the system is @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 are pauli operators of the @xmath6-th spin , @xmath7 is the local level splitting , and we express everything in units of the planck constant ( @xmath8 ) . since the molecule undergoes conformational changes , the distance @xmath2 between the two spins becomes a function of time : @xmath9 .",
    "the explicit time dependence of @xmath10 is determined by the specific choice of the molecular motion : initially , we consider forced periodic oscillations , while we later include an additional stochasticity . with this model , the molecular motion leads to an effective time dependent hamiltonian for the system that we can write as @xmath11 where , here and in the following , we use the short notation @xmath12 for all the quantities which depend on the distance @xmath2 and so implicitly on the time @xmath13 . for notational simplicity , we introduce the energy scale @xmath14 in terms of which the eigenenergies of the system hamiltonian @xmath15 and the corresponding eigenstates can be written as @xmath16 with @xmath17it can be seen that the energy spectra of the system hamiltonian @xmath18 , and in particular the ground state @xmath19 , depends on both the interaction strength @xmath20 and the local field @xmath21 , and thus is also time dependent . in case of weak spin - spin interaction @xmath22 ,",
    "e.g. when two spins are spatially separated from each other , the system hamiltonian can be approximated as @xmath23 , and the ground state approaches the separable state @xmath24 . as the spins move closer and the spin - spin interaction increases , the ground state changes according to @xmath25 in eq.([spectra ] ) .",
    "in particular , the entanglement contained in the ground state @xmath25 is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio @xmath26 , and can be quantified by the measure of concurrence @xcite .",
    "concurrence is zero for separable states and reach its maximum value @xmath27 for maximally entangled states ; here it can be calculated as @xmath28^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the complex conjugate of state @xmath25 ( expressed in the computational product basis , already used in eq.([spectra ] ) ) . in the meantime , the relative energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state @xmath30 decreases with the ratio @xmath31 .    before taking the environment into account ,",
    "it is worth looking at the adiabatic coherent evolution of the oscillating molecule , which will facilitate our discussions in the following sections .",
    "if the system hamiltonian changes slowly in time , the instantaneous eigenspaces of @xmath18 will undergo an independent evolution .",
    "the widely used condition that assures the adiabatic dynamics for closed quantum systems is @xmath32 for a detailed discussion concerning the validity of the adiabatic approximation we refer to @xcite . for the time - dependent system hamiltonian introduced in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) one easily gets @xmath33 and @xmath34 thus the adiabatic condition can be explicitly expressed as @xmath35 whenever the adiabatic condition is satisfied , the molecule that is initially in an eigenstate of the system hamiltonian will remain in the corresponding eigenstate , that is to say @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the dynamical phase and @xmath38 represents a geometric phase .",
    "one can check from eq.([de1]-[de2 ] ) that @xmath39 is fulfilled @xmath40 and all times .",
    "thus no geometric phase is accumulated , i.e. @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , and the adiabatic evolution can be expressed as follows @xmath43",
    "the coherent part of the spin dynamics due to the time - dependent system hamiltonian has to be incorporated into a more complex description which takes into account the presence of an environment .",
    "the actual environment of biological systems is very complex and probably sophisticated , and far from being thoroughly understood .",
    "however , one can adopt certain representative and well - investigated decoherence models to gain first insights into the open dynamics of bio - molecules .",
    "we first demonstrate the essential idea by considering the familiar decoherence model of spins coupled with independent thermal baths consisting of a large number of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the hamiltonian of the individual thermal bath coupled to the @xmath6-th spin ( @xmath44 ) is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the creation and annihilation operators for the @xmath42-th bath oscillator mode and @xmath48 the corresponding mode frequency .",
    "the coupling between the spin and the thermal bath is described by the following interaction hamiltonian @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the coupling amplitude to mode @xmath42 .    within the born - markov approximation , and by assuming that the adiabatic condition for closed quantum systems eq.([acc ] ) is satisfied , we have derived a time dependent lindblad - type quantum master equation @xcite for the system dynamics under the rotating wave approximation , which reads as @xmath51+\\mathcal{d}(t)\\rho(t)=\\mathcal{l}(t)\\rho(t ) , \\label{me0}\\ ] ] with the following dissipator @xmath52\\rho(t ) a^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha}[\\omega(t)]-a^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha}[\\omega(t ) ] a_{\\alpha}[\\omega(t)]\\rho(t)\\right\\}+h.c .",
    "a_{\\alpha}[\\omega(t)]=\\sum_{\\delta_{i j}(t)=\\omega(t ) } { \\left\\langle \\epsilon_{i}{(t)}\\right| } \\sigma_x^{(\\alpha ) } { \\left| \\epsilon_{j}{(t)}\\right\\rangle } \\times { \\left| \\epsilon_{i}{(t)}\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle \\epsilon_{j}{(t)}\\right| } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words ,",
    "the time dependence of the system hamiltonian introduces an implicit time dependence into the lindblad generators @xmath53 $ ] , as well as into the rates @xmath54 ( a sort of one - side fourier transform of the thermal bath correlation function , see @xcite ) .",
    "notice that , as already discussed for eq.([hamiltonian ] ) , the time dependence of @xmath55 ( and so also @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) is actually due to its dependence on the distance @xmath2 between the spins , from which the short notation , e.g. , @xmath58 .",
    "the bosonic thermal bath is characterized by its spectral density function @xmath59 which contains information on both the density of modes in the frequency domain and the strength of their coupling to the system . in the following ,",
    "we choose an ohmic spectral density @xmath60 , with cutoff frequency @xmath61 .",
    "the memory time of the thermal bath strongly depends on the cutoff frequency and so does its markovian or non - markovian behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the energy scale of the system transition frequencies , the reservoir loses its memory quickly , and is called markovian . the corresponding correlation function exhibits a sharply peaked kernel in the limit @xmath64 . in this case",
    ", one can simplify the spectral density as @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "we thus can write the fourier transformation of the thermal bath correlation function as @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the bosonic distribution function at inverse temperature @xmath69 .    in order to establish a comparison between the static and dynamic cases , we first consider the situation in which the two - spin bio - molecule is fixed in a static configuration . since the two spins are coupled to independent thermal baths at the same temperature , the corresponding quantum master equation mixes the energy eigenstates in the sense that the molecule is driven towards its thermal equilibrium state @xcite at the reservoir temperature @xmath70 . for each spin - spin interaction strength @xmath71 and local magnetic fields @xmath72 , the entanglement of the corresponding thermal equilibrium state , defined by @xmath73 , is quantified by @xcite @xmath74 with @xmath75 the partition function . after some calculations , it can be seen that the first derivative of @xmath76 with respect to @xmath69 is always non negative @xmath77 which means that the static thermal entanglement decreases as the temperature increases ; in particular , static entanglement can not survive if the temperature is higher than a certain critical temperature @xmath78 .",
    "in other words , if the molecule stays in a fixed configuration , entanglement will finally disappear for high enough temperatures , e.g. see fig .",
    "( [ fte ] ) . in this sense , the bosonic heat bath , even though it may not be a very realistic model of a biological environment , plays a useful role in our investigation .",
    "it is an example of an unfavorable environment , which can not introduce any entanglement by itself .     for @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "here @xmath83 can be varied independently , but it is their relative value which determines the dynamical behavior .",
    "therefore , here and in the following , we use dimensionless quantities obtained by setting the thermal energy @xmath84 as the unit of the energy scale ( so that @xmath85 ) with respect to which all the other parameters are determined , for example @xmath86 indicates that @xmath87.,width=302 ]    here we address the key question : _ what happens if one takes into account the molecular motion ? _ and in particular : _ can entanglement possibly build - up through the classical motions of the molecule ? _ the answer is affirmative and we demonstrate in the following that entanglement can indeed persistently recur in an oscillating molecule , even if the environment is so hot that any static thermal state is separable , i.e. the temperature @xmath88 for all possible molecular configurations encountered during the motion .      before proceeding , it is useful to present a simple qualitative picture which illustrates the idea of how entanglement can be established through classical motion even in noisy environments .",
    "we consider the following simple process : at time @xmath89 , two spins are far way from each other and the spin - spin interaction is very weak compared to the local magnetic fields .",
    "thus the system hamiltonian can be approximated as @xmath90 . due to the presence of the thermal bath",
    ", the molecule is driven into its thermal equilibrium state with the corresponding ground state population denoted as @xmath91 .",
    "if the local energy level splitting @xmath92 is comparable or larger than the thermal energy scale , @xmath93 , the ground state population @xmath91 at this distant configuration will be relatively larger than the corresponding populations of the other energy levels .",
    "nevertheless entanglement does not appear since the ground state is separable ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "let us further assume that the spins come closer at such a speed that the coherent evolution due to the system hamiltonian is adiabatic . while the spins approach each other , their interaction becomes stronger and the energy eigenstates adiabatically change into the ones of @xmath15 .",
    "in particular the ground state @xmath95 becomes more and more entangled as the coupling strength between spins increases , as indicated by the fact that its concurrence @xmath96 is an increasing function of the ratio @xmath31 .",
    "following this reasoning , it is possible that entanglement appears as a transient phenomenon as long as the adiabatic change of @xmath55 is still fast compared to the thermalization time scale @xmath97 with @xmath98 for the chosen simple ohmic spectral density .",

    "the dissipative environment now plays its usual destructive role .",
    "moreover , if the thermalization rate is fast compared to the adiabatic change of the system hamiltonian , entanglement is greatly suppressed .      to counter - act the detrimental effect of the environment and to sustain the generation of entanglement as a non - transient phenomenon , a persistent supply of free energy is needed .",
    "this is an organized form of energy which , as in our mechanism , can be introduced by conformational changes .",

    ", the essential condition for the proper function of the mechanism is that the dominant contribution to @xmath15 is due to the background field when the spins are far away , and due to their interaction when they are closest .",
    "this is a natural assumption , since the interaction generally increases when the distance is reduced .",
    "we assume that the two spins start from the distant configuration and are initially in the corresponding thermal equilibrium state .",
    "notice that this particular initial condition is irrelevant for the system asymptotic dynamics that we are interested in . at time",

    "the state of the molecule is driven out of thermal equilibrium , and entanglement is generated .",
    "when the spins move back to their distant configuration , the thermalization tends to increase the population of the ground state ( due to the increasing energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state ) , and thus effectively resets the system to a favorable condition .",

    "we rephrase our problem within the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics : in this formulation , the actual evolution of a quantum state is determined by the coherent sum of all the possible evolutions weighted via a phase proportional to the corresponding ( classical ) action .",
    "the presence of an environment in contact with the system leads to an additional weighting factor , the so - called influence functional @xcite .",
    "the influence functional depends on the system s possible evolution and on the properties of the bath , and in general is non - local in time .",
    "this formalism is particularly convenient in case of environments composed of non - interacting harmonic oscillators , where one can obtain an analytical expression for the influence functional @xcite .",
    "the part of the summation involving the system s degrees of freedom has to be performed numerically , and a particularly favourable prescription was introduced by makri & makarov under the acronym of quapi ( quasi adiabatic propagator path integral ) @xcite .",
    "their method allows one to include a finite time memory via a truncated influence functional which takes into account only a few of the last propagation steps .",
    "the memory time is determined by how many time steps are included and by how long each of them lasts : @xmath139 . in principle , the longer @xmath140 the further one can relax the markovian assumption . in practice , however , the computational effort scales exponentially with @xmath141 and the error in the single - step propagation quadratically in @xmath142 . to overcome these limitations , each simulation has to be performed with different parameters and one has to perform two extrapolation procedures : the first keeps constant @xmath140 while @xmath143 to obtain precise estimate with finite memory , the second increases @xmath144 to extrapolate the infinite memory time limit .",
    "these technical procedures are extensively presented in @xcite and are beyond the aim of this work : here we do not want to precisely quantify the amount of entanglement generated under a specific system - environment interaction , but our goal is to demonstrate that the mechanism we introduced is indeed robust and is not confined to the born - markov regime .",
    "however , we have selectively performed the extrapolation procedures for several points along the curves : the agreement is always good ( on the % level ) and consistent with the values of entanglement found before the extrapolations .",
    "the extent of the memory effects is determined by the so called bath response function brf : to properly take into account the non - markovianity of the environment , the memory time @xmath140 has to be larger than the bath correlation time given by the width of the brf , see fig .",
