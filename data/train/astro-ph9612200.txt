    "much of the information about the conditions in the vicinity of compact accreting objects , the region where most of the accretion kinetic energy is themalized and converted into radiation , has so far come from observations and modeling of their energy spectra .",
    "specifically , the observations of power - law high energy ( @xmath2 kev ) spectra has established the process of unsaturated comptonization of soft photons by hot electrons as the main process by which these spectra are produced ( see e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) .",
    "however , the spectral information alone does not suffice to determine the physical parameters of the system , since it can only determine the combination of the thomson depth , @xmath0 , and the electron temperature , @xmath3 , which is relevant to the comptonization of soft photons by the hot electrons , namely the comptonization parameter @xmath4 defined as @xmath5 , for @xmath6 . in this respect , one should bear in mind that for quasi - spherical , free - fall accretion , the above parameters , _ i.e. _ @xmath7 , are independent of the mass of the accreting object , provided that the accretion proceeds at the same fraction of its eddington value .",
    "thus , in order to completely determine the physical parameters of these systems , additional , independent information is needed to set the scale of the radius and the density of the emitting region , information which can only come from the dynamics of accretion .",
    "these arguments have motivated the study of time variability of accreting sources and in particular of galactic black hole candidates ; it was thought that the absence of a solid boundary in these bright sources would allow one to probe the dynamics of accretion onto the black hole .",
    "however , the study of time variability of black hole candidate sources , in particular the archetypal galactic source cyg x1 , has yielded a number of results which were rather unexpected when viewed within the standard framework of the viscous accretion disk model for the dynamics of matter accretion and emission of radiation from these sources : ( a ) the fluctuation power spectral densities ( hereafter psd ) are generally power laws of indices @xmath8 in the variability frequency @xmath9 , _",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see e.g. van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "the values of the slope , @xmath12 , of the psd are thus significantly flatter than these expected from exponential shots associated with the turbulent dynamics of the accreting gas near its last stable orbit ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "furthermore , the turnover frequency , @xmath14 , is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with the dynamics responsible for the emission of high energy radiation . for cyg x1 , the archetypal galactic black hole candidate , @xmath15 ( flicker noise ) , while @xmath16 hz , a far cry from the khz frequencies expected on the basis of dynamical considerations .",
    "( b ) in addition to these broad band spectral features , the psd of black hole candidates also exhibit qpo s .",
    "the observation of these features , thought to result from the  beating \" between the keplerian frequency of an accretion disk and the rotation of an underlying neutron star , poses a problem for systems thought to contain black holes .",
    "( c ) the spectral  temporal studies of miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) of the time lags between hard and soft photons as a function of the variability frequency @xmath9 , has indicated that these lags , at least in cyg x1 , decrease with increasing variability frequency @xmath9 , thus ruling out comptonization by an electron cloud of uniform density and temperature .    motivated by the discrepancy of the above systematics of time variability in black hole candidates from those expected on the basis of the  standard \" dynamical models of viscous accretion disks , we present in this study an alternative model for the time dependent spectral formation of comptonized radiation which can reproduce the basic observational features described above . in ",
    "2 we describe our model and demonstrate the relation between the psd shapes and the slopes of the photon energy spectra ; we also emphasize the nature of the white noise spectra below @xmath14 as well as the physics associated with the low value of this turnover frequency . in ",
    "3 we discuss the issue of the very low - frequency noise and we briefly review the relevance of the present model to rxte observations of cyg x-1 in its low and high states .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarize our results in  4 .",
    "our study uses as background the model of chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ; hereafter ct95 ) , i.e. quasi - spherical accretion with a centrifugally supported shock , which thermalizes the accretion kinetic energy and gives rise to the hot electrons responsible for the comptonization of soft photons .",
    "however , we postulate , in addition , that the quasi - spherically accreting component behaves like a hot  atmosphere \" of constant electron temperature @xmath17 kev and , more importantly , with a density profile @xmath18 in radius , extending to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is schwarzschild radius .",
    "this atmosphere is thought to be the result of preheating of the accretion flow by the radiation produced at the shock , as discussed by zeldovich & shakura ( 1969 ) and chang & ostriker ( 1985 and references therein ) ( see additional discussion on the issue of this specific density profile in  4 ) .    we assume , for simplicity , that the geometry of this configuration is spherical and that there is a source of soft photons within the spherical shock boundary of radius @xmath21 .",
    "the electron density is considered to be constant , @xmath22 , inside this boundary and @xmath23 in the atmosphere outside .",
    "the discontinuity of a factor 4 in density across the boundary @xmath21 is to account for the density jump across the shock .",
    "the physical size of this cloud is determined by the total optical depth @xmath0 .",
    "we have calculated the response of this configuration , i.e. the region interior to the shock plus the extended atmosphere , to an impulsive input of soft photons within the radius of the shock .",
    "the calculations were carried out by a modified monte carlo code based on the method described in hua & titarchuk ( 1995 ) .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show the resulting light curves at different energy bands for clouds with @xmath24 and 3 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 light seconds and outer radius of the atmosphere @xmath28 0.5 light seconds .",
    "it is apparent that their shapes have the form of power laws over the time range @xmath29 s to @xmath30 1 s , followed by an exponential cutoff at times of order a few seconds . for comparison ,",
    "the exponential light curves from a cloud with uniform density @xmath31 @xmath26 , radius @xmath32 cm ( @xmath33 light seconds ) the same electron temperature @xmath3 and @xmath34 are also shown ( dotted curves ) .      for a density distribution which is a power law , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath52 ( we herein consider the case @xmath53 ) @xmath54 .",
    "one can establish , by looking at the geometry of photon trajectories in a spherical geometry of radius @xmath55 , that for a photon which has scattered at radius @xmath56 the average distance before escape is given by @xmath57~,\\ ] ] indicating that for small values of @xmath56 the average delay time @xmath58 of photon escape after one scattering relative to the light crossing time of the entire atmosphere of size @xmath55 is @xmath59 the linearity between the scattering time @xmath44 and the delay time @xmath58 allows us to substitute @xmath58 in equation ( 2 ) above , leading to a light curve which is a power law in @xmath60 ( or better in @xmath58 ) with index equal to that of the density profile index @xmath61 .",
    "the monte carlo calculations shown in figure 1 support the arguments presented above .",
    "the slope of the the light curve for the uniform sphere of small scattering depth is close to zero ( dotted curve ) and that of the atmosphere considered here is close to -1 ; we have also used a density distribution appropriate to free - fall _ i.e. _ @xmath62 with results in accordance with the above arguments .",
    "it is well known ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1985 ) that for photons escaping from a source of finite size , the distribution of number of scatterings is an exponential i.e. @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the scattering number and the parameter @xmath65 is inversely proportional to the mean number of scatterings , @xmath66 , which is greater than @xmath67 for clouds with total optical depth @xmath68 .",
    "thus , as expected on the basis of this argument , the light curve has an exponential turnover at delays longer than @xmath69 times the scattering time at the largest decade of radius .",
    "these arguments therefore present the possibility that measuring these light curves , e.g. by computing the resulting psds , can provide _ a tool for uncovering the density profile of the atmosphere _ .    as the optical depth of the atmosphere increases , multiple scattering ( diffusion )",
    "effects in the extended atmosphere become more important and the above arguments , which rely on the single scattering approximation , have to be reformulated .",
    "the power law indices of the light curves evolve to smaller values ; in fact , in the uniform sphere case and for very large optical depths , as well known , the light curves become rising in time ( see e.g. hua & titarchuk 1996 ; hereafter ht96 ) .",
    "the flattening of the light curves is indicated clearly in our our monte carlo calculations presented in figures 1a and 1b .",
    "this change in the light curve slopes reflects directly on the resulting psd spectra , shown in figures 1c and 1d .",
    "it can be seen there that the psd curves are also power laws in fourier frequency @xmath9 , since the fourier transformation of a power - law , @xmath70 , is also a power - law in frequency @xmath71 .",
    "thus the flattening of the light curves leads to steepening of the psd spectra , which however , as a rule , are flatter than those corresponding to the psd of a uniform source ( @xmath72 ; dotted curves ) , which correspond to exponential - shot light curves .",
    "assuming that the temperature of the extended  atmosphere \" is constant , a change in its total optical depth @xmath0 , which results in a change of the light curve index and a steeper psd , will manifest itself , in addition , in the energy spectrum of the escaping radiation : the increase in optical depth will lead to a harder energy spectrum for the emerging photons . therefore , our considerations , supplemented by the monte carlo calculations , support to the conclusion that , under the assumption of the existence of an  atmosphere \" with the density profile described above , _ there should exist well defined correlations between the slopes of the escaping photon spectra and those of the psd_. we believe that rxte is uniquely suited to search and document the presence of such correlations .    in figure 2",
    "we plot the energy spectrum ( solid curve ) resulting from the extended atmosphere with parameters @xmath73 kev and @xmath74 .",
    "it is seen that it is almost identical to that from a uniform plasma cloud with the same electron temperature @xmath3 but a different optical thickness @xmath34 ( dashed curve ) . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the energy spectrum from a uniform cloud with the same temperature and @xmath74 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "it is seen that this spectrum is harder than the other two .",
    "this is because for the same total optical thickness ( @xmath74 ) , photons in the uniform cloud find it harder to escape than those in the @xmath75 atmosphere .",
    "this example shows clearly that spectroscopic analysis alone can not provide complete information about the source structure and to get a complete picture of the spectral formation it is necessary to analyze in conjunction the temporal as well as the spectral data .",
    "the time information is of course of vital importance for setting the physical scale of the system .",
    "since it is believed that comptonization is the main mechanism for the production of x - rays , measurements of the time lags between two different energies in the x - ray band should give us a direct estimate of the density of the region at which comptonization takes place .",
    "based on simple arguments concerning the dynamics of accretion onto compact objects , the associated time lags are expected be of the order of msec for galactic objects . it is worth noting that , for the uniform density hot clouds considered almost exlusively todate in the literature , the time lags between soft and hard photons are constant and independent of the fourier frequency @xmath9 .",
    "extensive caculations of this type ( _ i.e. _ of scattering in clouds of uniform density ) are given in ht96 .",
    "for the non - uniform density profile of the extended atmosphere discussed herein , the shape of the phase lag as a function of the variability frequency @xmath9 also changes . in figure 3",
    ", we plot the phase lags of photons in the 10  20 kev band relative to those in 1  10 kev band , for the four cases depicted in figure 1 , as a function of @xmath9 . as in figure 1",
    ", the dotted curve corresponds to the configuration of the uniform cloud described earlier and its shape is similar to those displayed in figures 14  17 of ht96 , except that here the curve extends to higher frequencies with a roughly constant slope instead of a sharp drop .",
    "this is because in present analysis we use much finer time bins than before .",
    "however , the maximum at frequency @xmath76 ( ht96 , eq .",
    "11 ) is clear and sharp . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase lags corresponding to the @xmath75 atmosphere configuration ( solid curves ) are much flatter and there is no maximum present across the entire range of frequencies .",
    "it is interesting to point out that this type of phase lag is hinted in the ginga observations of cyg x-1 ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 ) and also seen in the recent observations of the high state of cyg x-1 ( swank et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "as pointed out in ht96 , the psd associated comptonized photons of a given energy , depends strongly on the energy of the source , soft photons . in figure 1",
    ", the source photons have a blackbody temperature 2 kev . in figure 4",
    ", we present the psd curve ( solid curve ) in the energy range 10  20 kev resulting from the same configuration as that of @xmath34 in figure 1 , but with the source photons at blackbody temperature @xmath77 kev . compared to the corresponding psd curve in figure 1",
    ", it is seen that psd with lower source photon energy is steeper , in agreement with the analysis of ht96 .    in figure 4 , we also present one more psd ( dotted ) curve , corresponding to the same light curve as the solid one but for different time ranges and time bins . for the solid curve the light curve",
    "is calculated over a range of 4 seconds in 4096 bins . for the dotted curve , the light curve",
    "is calculated over 32 seconds in the same number of bins .",
    "it is seen that the psd turns flat for frequencies below @xmath78 hz while keeps parallel to the solid one above @xmath14 except at the highest frequency end , which is obviously due to aliasing ( see e.g. press et al .",
    "it is found from examining the light curve that the time scale corresponding to @xmath79 seconds is actually the time scale of the light curve beyond which the latter drops virtually to zero .",
    "thus we have found a possible physical meaning for the shoulder ( break ) frequency @xmath14 in the psd curves , which is common in the psd of many sources , namely , it indicates the time scale of the light curve , or alternatively the size of the extended @xmath75 atmosphere .",
    "the  white noise \" below @xmath14 reflects the average frequency of the shots while the power - law above @xmath14 reflects the time structure within one single shot .",
    "in addition to the fluctuation psd described above , galactic x - ray sources exhibit power - law type psd at frequencies much lower than @xmath14 , so that the white noise component at @xmath80 appears only as a shoulder in the much broader psd spectrum .",
    "we have thus reasons to believe that this very low frequency component in the psd is separate from the one described above .",
    "one should bear in mind that at radii @xmath81 , related to the dynamics associated with this component in the psd , the effects of preheating are thought to be small and accretion proceeds in the form of the standard viscous @xmath61-disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 hereafter ss73 ) . as a result , one can consider the fluctuations in the accretion rate @xmath82 to be resulting from small random variations in the viscosity parameter @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath83 .",
    "this model was considered by lyubarskij ( 1995 ) , who , by solving the angular momentum diffusion equation , showed that the resulting accretion rate and hence the luminosity , has a flicker - type fluctuation spectrum , provided that the characteristic time of the fluctuations in @xmath61 are of the order of the viscous time scales , and the fluctuations in @xmath61 at different radii are uncorrelated .",
    "we provide here a heuristic derivation of this fact for the sake of completeness of the discussion .",
    "the accretion time @xmath84 from a radius @xmath85 in an @xmath61-disk is    @xmath86^{-1}.\\eqno(4)\\ ] ] the variation @xmath87 in the viscosity parameter @xmath61 in an annulus leads to the mass accretion rate variations @xmath88 .",
    "in fact the contribution in the mass variation caused by the viscosity variations is proportional to the annulus area @xmath89 , the surface density @xmath64 and inversely proportional to the accretion time @xmath84 _ i.e. _ , @xmath90 in different accretion disk regions ( ss73 ) ( region * a * : @xmath91 and @xmath92 , region * b * : @xmath93 and @xmath92 , region * c * : @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) there are different dependences of the surface density @xmath64 and thickness of disk @xmath95 on radius . for region *",
    "a * , @xmath96 , @xmath95 is almost constant and hence @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "4 ) ; for region * b * , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; for region * c * , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . despite the differences in the behavior of the main parameters over the disk one can check by substituting the above expressions of @xmath64 , @xmath95 and @xmath84 in eqs . 4 and 5 that the mass ( or luminosity ) variations are the same for all zones * a - c * , namely @xmath104 and thus the resulting power spectrum @xmath105 is @xmath106 in other words if the amplitude of the variations in @xmath61 are the the same at different radii then the amplitudes of accretion rate ( luminosities ) variations are the same at different time scales ( lyubarskij 1995 ) .",
    "we have presented above a model which implies corelations between the spectral and temporal properties of accreting compact objects and have pointed out that this relation , along with independent measurements of the electron temperature @xmath3 , can allow a complete specification of the physical parameters of these systems , including the density profile of the extended atmosphere .",
    "much of the present discussion relies on the specific form of the density @xmath107 of the accreting matter as a function of radius @xmath85 .",
    "clearly , this is not the free - falling solution customarily used in association with spherically symmetric accretion , so a few comments are in order .",
    "if the presence of the extended atmosphere is due to the effects of preheating , as suggested in  1 , then at the edge of this atmosphere , at @xmath108 , one would expect the random and rotational velocities of matter to be comparable and that the subsequent evolution of the accreting fluid in radius to be predominantly governed by the removal of its angular momentum .",
    "the agent responsible for this process is considered herein to be the interaction of the fluid with the photons produced at the base of the extended atmosphere , _",
    "i.e. _ near the schwarzschild radius @xmath109 .",
    "in order to estimate the effectiveness of this process we compare the free - fall time scale , @xmath110 , with that of the viscous time scale , @xmath111 , assuming that the density has the required profile . assuming that the density profile of the atmosphere has the form @xmath112 between radii @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , mass conservation dictates that the the infall velocity , @xmath116 , will also have a similar scaling between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath117 , yielding for the free - fall time @xmath118 .",
    "the photons can achieve the required angular momentum removal if @xmath119 .    under the assumed density and velocity scalings ,",
    "the angular momentum of the fluid at a radius @xmath85 would be @xmath120 .",
    "this fluid interacts and transfers its angular momentum to photons diffusing from the interior regions of the atmosphere which carry substantially smaller angular momentum .",
    "the specific density profile we have assumed , which implies an equal optical depth per decade of radius , guarantees that : ( a ) the angular momentum of the photons , as they traverse each decade in radius , is much smaller than the local angular momentum of the fluid . (",
    "b ) the photons interact with the fluid at every decade in radius with probability @xmath121 before their escape , carrying away angular momentum at a rate @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the total luminosity of accretion .",
    "the viscous time scale for the fluid at radius @xmath85 is then the time required for the fluid at radius @xmath85 to get rid of its angular momentum , _ i.e. _ ,      the luminosity @xmath123 is given simply by the total accretion rate @xmath125 and the innermost radius of the accretion disk @xmath126 , _ i.e. _ @xmath127 with the parameter @xmath65 allowing for accretion onto the compact object other than that associated with the spherically accreting component ( most likely associated with a viscous geometrically thin disk ) . substituting the expression for @xmath123 onto equation ( 8) above yields for the viscous time scale @xmath128",
    "the above expression indicates that the removal of the angular momentum of the accreting matter by the photons produced near @xmath129 can in fact proceed on dynamical time scales and thus preserve the assumed density profile provided that @xmath130 , _",
    "i.e. _ that the total accretion rate ( including an additional component , most likely from an accretion disk ) is @xmath131 times that associated with the spherically symmetric component .",
    "we reiterate that , most likely , this process is possible only for the density profile prescribed above ( @xmath18 ) , since this is the only profile which allows for significant photon scattering , and hence removal of angular momentum , from a large range of radii .",
    "the presence of the extended atmosphere discussed above , due presumably to upstream heating of the accreting matter , may bear relevance not only to accreting black holes as discussed herein , but also to accreting neutron stars , with the overall similarity of their psd spectra ( van der klis 1995 ) not being simply coincidental .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that coherent oscillations of this configuration ( the extented atmosphere ) may in fact be related to the qpo phenomenon , a phenomenon prevalent among all members of the more general class of accreting compact sources , whether neutron stars or black holes .",
    "the observed qpo frequencies are generally smaller than those associated with the dynamical motions near a black hole or a neutron star , and similar to those associated with the outer radius @xmath114 of our model , implying the possible relevance of this characteristic time scale in these systems too .",
    "this model may also bear relevance to the recently discovered khz qpo s in four lmxbs ( strohmayer 1996 , zhang 1996 ) , as this is the time scale expected for variability in the centrifugally supported shock presumably present at the base of the extended atmosphere , especially in objects containing neutron stars rather than black holes ( titarchuk & lapidus 1996 ) .",
    "the presence of a reflection - by - cold - matter component and fluorescent @xmath132 line emission in the observed spectra of black hole candidates and agns ( e.g. ebisawa et al 1996 ) could also be related with an extended atmosphere of the type discussed above : a significant fraction of hard photons can in the present case random walk over the entire extended atmosphere and the possibility arises that it can be reflected by far - away , relatively cold parts of the visous accretion disk to produce the required components .",
    "in addition to the above and in accordance with the model of ct95 , one would expect a variation in the temporal properties of accreting compact sources while at their different spectral states . as discussed by ct95",
    ", the changes in the spectral states derive from the presence of a sufficiently large number of soft photons from the viscous accretion disk to cool the electrons to temperatures at which comptonization is ineffective .",
    "this manifests as a prominent thermal - like peak at energies @xmath133 kev . under the same conditions",
    ", one could expect the extended hot atmosphere to be absent , a fact which should manifest itself in the associated psd by the absence of power at the lowest frequencies .",
    "we have presented above a model which implies the existence of a correlation between the temporal and spectral properties of accreting compact sources .",
    "our model is consistent with certain general characteristics associated with the psd of accreting compact sources observed to date , in particular with their spectral forms and the breaks associated with the low frequency turn - overs .",
    "it is also consistent with the observed frequency dependent phase lags between photons of different energies and can also account for their photon spectra .",
    "this model is specific enough that we believe can it be meaningfully tested by combined spectal - temporal measurements of these sources .",
