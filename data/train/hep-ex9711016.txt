    "the hermes experiment was designed primarily to study the spin structure of the nucleon in polarized deep inelastic electron / positron nucleon scattering .",
    "it uses the polarized positron beam at hera and an internal gas target . for more details , see the other hermes contributions to these proceedings , ref .",
    "@xcite    the strength of hermes lies in its ability to detect the scattered positron and the hadronic final state . at hermes",
    "many particles such as @xmath0 s can be reconstructed from the final state hadrons in numbers that make detailed analysis of their properties possible .",
    "since the @xmath1 decay violates parity , the polarization can be reconstructed from the angular distribution of the decay products . at hermes the target and",
    "beam polarization will affect the @xmath1 polarization , either by transfer of polarization from the nucleon s quarks , or through the polarized virtual photon .",
    "hermes can detect the current and target fragmentation region of @xmath1 production .",
    "the current fragmentation will give information about the @xmath2 quark fragmentation and the target fragmentation will provide insight into the polarization of the strange sea .",
    "in the current fragmentation region ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the fraction of available longitudinal momentum , defined to be along the beam line , transferred to the hadron in the @xmath5 center of mass frame ) @xmath1 s acquire their polarization during the polarized quark fragmentation .",
    "aleph @xcite and opal@xcite have recent significant negative results for longitudinal polarization from @xmath6 decays in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "this is due to the fragmentation of @xmath8 quarks which are highly polarized @xcite . for deep inelastic scattering , the @xmath2 is the dominant quark @xcite and a substantial longitudinal @xmath1 polarization would be a signature for spin transfer of the virtual photon to the @xmath2 quark and correspondingly of the @xmath2-quark polarization in the @xmath1 .    for a positron or electron beam of polarization @xmath9 on an unpolarized target",
    "the resulting @xmath1 polarization is predicted to be ( for a small positron scattering angle)@xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the depolarization factor , @xmath12 is the polarization transferred from the beam positrons to the @xmath1 , @xmath13 is the charge for quark @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the spin average quark distribution for the nucleon , @xmath16 is the spin dependent fragmentation function for a quark fragmenting into a @xmath1 , and @xmath17 are the corresponding spin - independent fragmentation functions .",
    "information about the u - quark fragmentation function ratio @xmath18 in the current fragmentation region can be obtained .",
    "estimates of precision for an experiment like hermes based on the @xmath2 quark dominance have been calculated elsewhere @xcite .      in the target fragmentation region ( @xmath19 )",
    "the struck quark has non - zero net longitudinal polarization , and ellis model @xcite suggests that the remnant @xmath8 quark will have a _",
    "negatively - correlated _ polarization which is transferred to the @xmath1 .",

    "measurement of @xmath26 in the target fragmentation region will give insight into the polarization of the strange sea quarks .",
    "since the @xmath27 decay violates parity , its polarization can be determined by the angular distribution of its decay products . to measure longitudinal @xmath1 polarization ,",
    "the cosine of the angle between the direction of the @xmath1 momentum in the lab and the proton ( @xmath28 ) in the @xmath1 rest frame is reconstructed and the mean value calculated ( @xmath29 ) . however , the acceptance of the hermes spectrometer is asymmetric in @xmath28 .",
    "this is because the pion s momentum is much softer than that of the proton , and the pion is more likely to miss all or part of the hermes acceptance .",
    "it is necessary , therefore , to reverse the beam polarization and compare @xmath28 distributions for both helicities to obtain the polarization .",
    "hermes had two periods of dedicated unpolarized target running in 1996 and 1997 between which the beam helicity was reversed .",
    "an unpolarized target allows for a higher density ( @xmath30  @xmath31  s@xmath32 ) than the polarized target , so that a large number of deep inelastic events can be collected over a short period of time .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1 analysis becomes simplified since it does not have to take into account the polarization transfer from the target nucleons .",
    "a short summary of the events collected for the two periods of running is shown in table  [ tab : unpol ] .",
    ".summary of hermes statistics collected during unpolarized target running .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     overall there is a factor of 4 improvement in statistics , a larger fraction of events are in the target fragmentation region , and a very good reduction of the acceptance - caused asymmetry in the @xmath28 angular distribution .",
    "it is also proposed to have a transversely polarized target .",
    "the transverse @xmath1 polarization for a transversely polarized target and unpolarized electron beam is predicted to be@xcite : @xmath33 the @xmath34 are the transversity difference quark distributions in the nucleon and the @xmath35 are the @xmath1 transverse fragmentation functions . using a transverse target will allow us to measure transverse @xmath1 polarization @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , it might be possible to measure the transverse structure function @xmath36 via @xmath1 asymmetries@xcite .",
    "hermes will extract a preliminary longitudinal @xmath26 from 1996 and 1997 data in the near future .",
    "the expected statistical accuracy for @xmath26 is about 0.013 for @xmath37 @xmath1 s in each helicity data set . continuing in 1999 , hermes will increase the @xmath1 statistics and explore target fragmentation with the lambda wheels .",
    "the possibility of running with a transversely polarized target promises more exploration of interesting @xmath1 physics ."
