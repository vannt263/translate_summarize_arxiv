    "since 2009 may 2 , the _ kepler _ spacecraft has been collecting science - quality photometric data of more than 150,000 stars . based on the first 5 months of data , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b11 ) identified 1235 planet candidates associated with 997 host stars .",
    "analysis of the first 16 months of data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b12 ) yielded additional 1091 viable planet candidates  termed kepler objects of interest , or kois .",
    "the almost uninterrupted accurate _ kepler _ light curves of these kois enable the community to detect minute changes in the observed transit light curves .",
    "this is especially true for the individual times of transit , which for some kois show variation ( = ttv ) relative to a linear ephemeris that assumes a constant keplerian orbit .",
    "these ttvs can indicate a dynamical interaction with additional objects in the system , as was predicted by the seminal works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , ttvs turn out to be a crucial tool in the study of systems with known multiple transiting planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , ttvs can do much more .",
    "they may indicate dynamical interactions with unseen , otherwise undetected , additional objects in the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it can be useful to perform a systematic search for ttv in all kois , as was done in the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f11 ) and was continued with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f12 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s12 ) works , based on the first six quarters of kepler data .",
    "this paper is a follow - up of f11 , f12 and s12 studies ( see also the catalog of rowe et al . , private communication ) , presenting a systematic analysis of the first _",
    "twelve _ quarters of the _ kepler _ data of all kois .",
    "the goal is to produce an easy - to - use catalog that can stimulate further analysis of interesting systems and statistical analysis of the sample of kepler kois with significant ttvs .    after presenting the details of our pipeline and the catalog itself ( section  [ analysis ] )",
    ", we derive a few statistical characteristics of each ttv series that can identify the ones with significant variations ( section 3 ) .",
    "sections 4 and 5 list @xmath4 systems with highly significant ttvs , and section  [ comments ] comments on some interesting systems , in particular the ones for which the derived ttvs could be of a non - dynamical origin . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we present a few basic statistical features of the sample of the @xmath2 systems , and briefly discuss the possible use of the catalog .",
    "the catalogs of b11 and b12 ( http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/planet _ candidates.html ) listed @xmath5 kois , out of which we did not analyze @xmath6 kois . these included @xmath3 kois for which b12 had only one transit ( b12 had 20 systems with only one transit , but since then kepler additional data showed more transits for seven of them , so we were left with only 13 with one transit ) , one koi that did not have a measured transit duration , and seven kois with transit duration of less than one hour , too short for our analysis .",
    "we therefore analyzed the light curves of @xmath7 kois .",
    "we used the publicly available pdc long - cadence ( ftp://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/lightcurves/tarfiles ) data , which used the bjd@xmath8 timings .",
    "we started by phase - folding the _ kepler _ light curve of each koi with its ephemeris in b12 , in order to obtain the best possible template for the transit light curve ( see below for details ) .",
    "we used the best - fit transit model as a template to measure the actual timing of each individual transit timing ( = tt ) and derive its o - c  the difference between the tt and the expected time , based on the linear ephemeris . for kois with high enough snr ( see below ) , we derived the tts while allowing the duration and depth of each transit to vary as well . considering our template just as a mathematical function , finding the timing , duration and depth of a transit was equivalent to moving the center of the template or stretching it in the time and flux dimensions . in our approach , we searched for the minimum of the sum - of - squared residuals , the standard @xmath9 function , in the three - parameter space . similarly to @xcite , we iterated the procedure , aligning the transits based on their measured timings , in order to generate a better transit model , and then re - analyzed the individual transits . finally , we modified @xmath10 , the timing of the first transit , and the period of each koi , whenever we detected a significant linear trend in our o - cs , and re - derived the o - cs relative to the new ephemerides .",
    "although the main focus of this paper was the ttvs of the kois , we opted to vary the three parameters of the template simultaneously for kois with high enough snrs , because we found a few kois for which the transit duration or depth did vary significantly , either because of physical processes , or as a result of some observational effects .",
    "one example is koi-13 , for which @xcite have found some indications for a long - term variation of the impact parameter , equivalent to detecting variation of the transit duration .",
    "our analysis , now based on twelve quarters , confirms the result of @xcite , and is presented in figure  [ koi13_tdv ] .",
    "one can see the highly significant linear duration variation of koi-13 , which amounts to @xmath11 peak - to - peak modulation over the entire data span . for such cases",
    "the simultaneous analysis of timing , duration and depth is an advantage , and , in principle , can yield better timing of each transit .",
    "however , for low - snr transits , minimizing the @xmath9 function with respect to the three parameters simultaneously could yield a completely erroneous result , based on some accidental local minimum in a noisy @xmath9 surface .",
    "in fact , for systems with even lower snr , fitting the timing alone could yield misleading minima .",
    "we therefore divided the kois into three groups , according to their typical snr for a _ single _ transit , defined as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the relative transit depth , @xmath14 is the relative uncertainty per point , derived from the scatter of the light curve outside the transit , and @xmath15 is the averaged number of points per single transit . for each koi we derived the median of its transit snrs .",
    "we considered three classes of kois :    * @xmath16  this class included @xmath17 kois .",
    "we did not perform any analysis for objects of this class , due to the poor snr .",
    "* @xmath18  this class included @xmath19 kois , for which we have calculated tts , while fixing the transit duration and depth , derived from the best - fit model . * @xmath20  for the 721 kois in this class , we derived simultaneously the transit timing , duration and depth .",
    "our default choice for the transit templates was the @xcite model , which we derived for each koi s folded light curve through a @xmath9 minimization .",
    "however , since some transits showed slight asymmetries , e.g. , koi-13 @xcite , and other transits had snr values which were too low for a convincing mandel - agol fit , we used two additional models as possible templates : `` legendre - based '' and `` fermi - based '' models , which are described below .",
    "we computed these three models for each koi , and chose the model with the lowest @xmath9 value as the transit template .",
    "however , due to the astrophysical basis of the mandel - agol model  in contrast to the other two which were merely mathematical heuristics  we preferred the mandel - agol model whenever it gave a good enough fit .",
    "hence , we chose the mandel - agol model also in cases where its r.m.s .  exceeded the r.m.s .  of the other two models by up to 5% .",
    "below we provide a few details about the three models :    * we used our own code to fit the @xcite model , with a quadratic limb - darkening law , using coefficients that we interpolated from @xcite tables , assuming @xmath21 , solar metallicity , and _ kepler _ kic temperature @xcite .",
    "* the legendre - based model had the form : + @xmath22 + where @xmath23 was the legendre polynomial of order @xmath24 , @xmath25 was the normalized phase of the transit , such that at the beginning of ingress @xmath26 , and at the end of egress @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 were linear parameters found analytically , and @xmath30 were the maximum orders we allowed for each function .",
    "we optimized the model by varying the phases of @xmath31 and @xmath32 within the orbital period .",
    "we avoided local bumps in the model by reducing its three orders ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) separately and by using linear fits to overcome local changes in convexity . *",
    "the fermi - based model had the form : + @xmath36,\\ ] ] + where @xmath25 was the phase of the transit , as for the legendre model , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 were free parameters , standing for the transit phase , ingress and egress steepness , width and depth of the transit . in order to obtain a more `` transit - like '' shape , we replaced the points at the bottom part of the transit with a parabola , with its width as another free parameter , under the constraint that the resulting function and its first derivative were both continuous .    for most kois",
    "the pipeline selected the @xcite model ( 1829 kois ) .",
    "it chose the legendre - based model when there was a significant asymmetry in the folded light curve of the transit ( 87 kois ) , and the fermi - based one only when the snr of the folded light curve was low ( 44 kois ) .",
    "we analyzed each transit after fitting a polynomial to the light curve on the two sides of the transit , in order to remove stellar and instrumental long - term photometric variations during the transit .",
    "we derived the timing , and when appropriate the duration and depth , of each transit by minimizing the standard @xmath9 function using the    matlab fminsearch    function , based on the nelder - mead simplex method @xcite , assuming each measurement had the same error .",
    "our pipeline then made sure that the @xmath9-minimum found was indeed the global minimum by an automated grid search over the parameter space .",
    "we then used the @xmath41-test to compare the transit model with the timing ( and duration and depth when appropriate ) found against a constant flux assumption ( no transit at all ) , and rejected all transits with an @xmath41-test false alarm probability ( = fap ) larger than 0.025 .",
    "for these cases , the transit timing table quotes no timing ( nor duration and depth ) .",
    "we estimated the errors of the three quantities from the inverted hessian matrix , calculated at the minimum .",
    "the error of each individual _ kepler _ measurement was based on the scatter of the light curve around the polynomial fit before and after each transit .",
    "when the hessian matrix turned out to be singular , we assigned an error that was equal to the median of the other errors derived for the koi in question .",
    "whenever that was the case we marked the error with an asterisk in the table of transit timings .    for each koi , we ignored outlying timing , duration and depth values when their corresponding o - c values were too different from the other o - cs of that koi , or their error estimate was too large .",
    "usually , a large error meant that some photometric measurements during that transit were erroneous .",
    "we rejected outliers based on both global and local mean and scatter .",
    "a value was considered an outlier if it deviated from the mean by more than five times the scatter of the series , defined as 1.4826 times its median absolute deviation ( mad ) , plus three times its own error .    in order to check the obtained uncertainties for the transit timings , we computed for each koi the scatter of its o - c values , @xmath42 , and compared it with its typical error , derived for each koi by the median of its timing uncertainties  @xmath43 .",
    "we expect these two values to be similar for systems with no significant ttv .",
    "this is indeed the case , as can be seen in figure  [ madvsmed_error ] .",
    "the kois with o - c scatter larger than their uncertainties are those with significant ttvs .",
    "another approach to check our error estimate is to compare the typical derived error of a koi with the snr of its transit .",
    "one can expect the timing precision to improve with higher snr . in order to see whether this is really the case ,",
    "figure  [ med_errors_vssnr ] shows the median error , @xmath43 , versus the median snr of that koi , presenting a tight correlation over the whole range of snr , which goes from 2.5 to 1000 .",
    "the plot is consistent with the simple relation @xmath44 which is also plotted in the figure .",
    "the last two figures suggest that our error estimate is realistic .",
    "we present our results in two tables , available at ftp://wise-ftp.tau.ac.il/pub/tauttv/ttv .",
    "table  [ tab : ephemeris ] lists the modified ephemerides of the kois , based on our analysis , together with the durations and depths of their transits , derived from the folded light curve .",
    "the transit duration is quoted as a fraction of the orbital period and the depth in units of the stellar intensity outside the transit .",
    "table  [ tab : ttv ] lists our derived o - cs , relative to our modified ephemerides , for 167934 transits of 1960 kois with @xmath45 . of those ,",
    "duration and depth changes , in units of the transit model duration and depth , are given for @xmath46 transits of 721 kois with @xmath47 .",
    ".linear ephemerides of the koi transits , together with their durations and depths [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : short ]",
    "in this section we comment on a few kois from tables [ tab : ttv_interesting][tab : short ] .",
    "in particular , we phase - folded the light curves of all @xmath4 systems with their orbital period , and searched for a secondary dip . for eleven systems we found a significant secondary dip , in most cases at phase @xmath48 , which we interpreted as either an eclipse of a secondary star , or a planetary occultation .",
    "we also point out any periodic ttv modulation that could have been induced either by the long cadence sampling or by the stellar spot periodic activity . some of these systems were analyzed in a similar way by sz13 , who used six quarters of _ kepler _ data to look for ttv periodicity .",

    "the folded light curve displays a shallow occultation . *",
    "koi-@xmath50 ( figure 4 ) : the ttv modulation has one of the largest amplitudes in the sample .",
    "one cosine function was not enough to model the modulation , and therefoe the o - cs include at least two different frequencies .",
    "this might be the result of some non - linear effect of the dynamical interaction .",

    "we present here @xmath4 kois with highly significant ttvs , @xmath2 with long - term modulations ( section 4 , table 4 ) , and 13 kois with short - period low - amplitude ttv periodicities ( section 5 , table 5 ) . out of the @xmath2 systems ,",
    "@xmath91 show clear periodicities , with well determined periods and amplitudes .",
    "another @xmath92 kois have periods too long to be established without a doubt . for those we need to wait for more data before the ttv period can be safely determined .",
    "another six systems display coherent modulations , but not a clear stable periodicity .",
    "we have found an indication for some correlation , of @xmath93 , between the koi period and the period of its ttv , as can be seen in figure  [ pvsorbitalp ] .",
    "this is of no surprise , as the orbital period of a planet determines the natural time scale of the dynamical interaction , and therefore one can expect the ttv periodicity to be correlated with this time scale .",
    "another correlation , of @xmath94 , between the amplitudes and the periods of the detected ttv periodicities , emerged from our sample ( see figure  [ avsp ] ) , as was predicted , for example , by @xcite .",
    "the same correlation appeared when we plotted the amplitude in units of the koi orbital period .",
    "we point out a possible non - dynamical origin of some of the ttvs presented here .",
    "in particular , the short - period modulations could be due to either the long cadence sampling of _ kepler _ or the stellar spot periodic activity ( sz13 ) .",
    "we found evidence that five out of the @xmath3 short - period detected ttvs are due to the stellar periodicity .",
    "we also found that koi-@xmath49 and @xmath68 show a periodicity induced by the kepler sampling .",
    "the sample of @xmath4 kois with significant ttvs includes @xmath95 systems discussed by f11 ( @xmath96 kois ) , f12 ( @xmath97 kois ) , @xcite ( @xmath98 kois ) , and @xcite ( @xmath99 kois ) , all based only on a fraction of the data available now .",
    "references to those four works can be found in table  [ tab : ttv_interesting ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare the analysis of f11 , f12 and @xcite on one hand and the present results on the other hand , and see how doubling the time span can change our assessment of the nature of the modulation . in many cases the time span of the first six quarters was not long enough to detect a local maximum _ and _",
    "minimum of the ttv modulation , and therefore the periodicity of the modulation could not be estimated .",
    "one illustrious example is koi-142 , with its peak - to - peak amplitude of more than 1200 min ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one could hope that the accumulating details of the observed ttv could give some hints for the orbital elements of the perturbing unseen planet , at least for some of the single kois .",
    "however , as discussed already by @xcite and @xcite , the amplitude and periodicity of the ttv modulation depends on various parameters , in particular the mass and the orbital period of the unseen planet and how close the orbits of the two planets are to some mean motion resonance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is quite difficult to deduce the parameters of the unseen planet , although some stringent constraints can be derived , as was done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we hope that the available catalog will motivate a similar work on other single - koi systems with significant ttv",
    ".    one parameter that has interesting implications on our understanding of planetary formation is the relative inclination between the orbital plane of the observed planet and that of the presumed interacting planet for the cases of single kois with significant ttvs .",
    "relative inclination can induce a precession of the orbital motion of the observed planet , which can manifest itself in a modulation of the transit duration and depth .",
    "although the focus of the present work is on the ttvs , the catalog , which includes derived tdvs and tpvs , can , in principle , help to identify systems with a relative inclination .",
    "furthermore , stringent upper limits on tdvs and tpvs for systems with detected ttvs can help to constrain the relative inclinations between the planets .",
    "however , an observed precession is not necessarily induced by a planet with a non - vanishing relative inclination .",
    "an observed precession of the orbital plane just proves that the total angular momentum of the system is not parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the transiting planet .",
    "the origin of the precession could also be a misalignment of the stellar rotation axis relative to the angular momentum of the planet , an idea that was unthinkable not long ago , but has now a solid evidence in the accumulating data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "an example is koi-13 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figure  [ koi13_tdv ] ) .",
    "regardless , we suggest that systems with detected significant tdvs and tpvs deserve further close study .",
    "finally , we present here a systematic ttv analysis of twelve quarters of _ kepler _ observations of all kois .",
    "one could expect that the derived ttvs , for the single kois in particular , could help in constructing a _ statistical _ picture of the frequency and architecture of the population of the planetary multiple systems of the kepler kois ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to perform such a statistical analysis one needs to model the dependence of the detectability of ttv coherent modulation on the parameters of the unseen perturbing planet .",

    "<S> , we have found @xmath2 kois that showed highly significant ttvs , and @xmath3 that had short - period ttv modulations with small amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two effects that could cause _ apparent _ periodic ttv  the finite sampling of the observations and the interference with the stellar activity , stellar spots in particular . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss some statistical aspects of our detected ttvs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ttv period is correlated with the orbital period of the planet and with the ttv amplitude . </S>"
