    "in the impulse approximation ( ia ) , lepton - nucleus interaction is described as a two step process : in the first step , the lepton interacts with a single bound nucleon , and in the second one , the resulting particles propagate inside the nucleus .",
    "the ia formalism is the basic framework in which @xmath01-gev leptons scattering is described : on one hand , it is the approach applied to understand electron scattering , and , on the other , it is used to model neutrino interactions  @xcite .",
    "the status of these two cases is quite different : for electrons a lot of experimental data exist , whereas for neutrinos precise measurements are still missing . due to this lack of knowledge ,",
    "reliable theoretical models are needed in the next generation of precise neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite , possibly with liquid argon target .    to construct a successful model of neutrino - nucleus scattering",
    ", the following procedure seems to be well justified :    * relevant kinematical region in energy and momentum transfer has to be identified , * description of a  nucleus for electron scattering should be formulated in this kinematical region , * performance of the electron scattering model must be confronted with the existing data , and , if the agreement is satisfactory , * the same treatment of nuclear effects should be applied to neutrino interactions .",
    "this is the basic logic of this paper , in which we propose a  model to describe the @xmath01-gev neutrino scattering off medium - mass nuclei , such as calcium and argon .",
    "the article reports continuation of the research started in ref .  , where a  less sophisticated description was applied to argon , and ref .",
    "@xcite , where the model was introduced .    in the ia regime ,",
    "a nucleus is described by means of the spectral function ( sf ) .",
    "the sf contains information about the momentum distribution in conjunction with the distribution of binding energy of nucleons inside the the nucleus .",
    "evaluation of the sf for medium nuclei requires several approximations . in our presentation",
    ", we try to identify and justify all the theoretical assumptions , but the most important argument for the correctness of our model is the agreement of its predictions with the data for electron scattering .",
    "detailed verification of the description is performed using two targets , namely oxygen and calcium .",
    "oxygen was selected because of additional opportunity to compare results with a  more systematic theoretical approach to modeling of the sf  , whereas the calcium nucleus is most similar to argon s , for which precise measurements have been performed .",
    "our description of is confronted also with the theoretical results of butkevich and mikheyev  . finally , a comparison with the few known data for electron scattering off argon  @xcite is done as well .",
    "basic computations of quasielastic inclusive scattering are standard and can be found elsewhere  .",
    "the outcome of numerical calculations depends on several assumptions which specify the implementation of the sf model .",
    "we apply the recent bbba05 parameterization of the proton and neutron form factors  @xcite .",
    "the off - shell hadronic current matrix elements are evaluated with the use of the standard de forest prescription  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the electromagnetic case , we adopt a  procedure to impose electromagnetic current conservation .",
    "such prescription is not unique , and for this reason , in the case of weak interactions , we avoid analogous manipulations with the vector part of the current and rely on the de forest approach only .",
    "an important ingredient in calculations is the treatment of final - state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "there are several approaches to deal with them , e.g. , the wentzel - kramers - brillouin method , relativistic mean - field approach  , or correlated glauber approximation  . in the previous article",
    ", we adopted the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) and disregarded fsi beyond the pauli blocking , arguing that this approach is sufficient to describe neutrino scattering . in this paper , the presented model is validated by confronting it with a large sample of electron scattering data and this comparison requires inclusion of fsi .",
    "we consider two fsi effects : pauli blocking and reinteractions of the struck nucleon with the spectator system described by means of the time - independent optical potential  .    in the lepton energy range of @xmath01  gev , two dynamical mechanisms are most important : quasielastic ( qe ) scattering ( throughout this article we use the terminology of the neutrino community ) and single pion production through the @xmath1 excitation .",
    "they clearly manifest themselves as two peaks in the electron differential cross section in energy transfer for fixed scattering angle .",
    "our numerical computations include the qe dynamics only .",
    "the reason is that our concern is to define a  systematic procedure to construct sf , and it is sufficient to test it in the case of the qe process .",
    "thank to this , we avoid dynamical issues in which the theoretical situation is not completely clear , namely the nonresonant background and two - particles  two - holes excitations  .",
    "however , we have to pay the price for the constraint on the dynamics we adopted ; in comparisons of our predictions with the experimental data , for higher values of the energy transfer some strength is systematically missing . strictly speaking ,",
    "we verify our model only in the kinematical region of energy transfers below the qe peak .",
