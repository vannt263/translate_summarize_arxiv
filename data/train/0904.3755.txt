    "arranged in a body - centered tetragonal lattice , the molecules are well separated from each other so that the magnetic interaction between them is negligible and , to a good approximation , the magnetic clusters respond independently to an external magnetic field . there is a strong magnetic anisotropy along the symmetry ( c axis ) of the crystal that creates a barrier against spin reversal of approximately 60 k , a barrier that can be reduced by applying a magnetic field along the easy axis of magnetization @xcite .",
    "each molecule in the crystal can be modeled with the effective hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 k , @xmath3 k , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a small symmetry - breaking term that gives rise to tunneling @xcite ; @xmath6 is the component of the spin lying along the c - axis of the crystal and the magnetic field @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the applied magnetic field and @xmath9 is the magnetization .",
    "the anisotropy barrier allows the spins to be prepared in a metastable state anti - parallel to an external magnetic field . when a molecule s spin reverses , making a transition from the metastable well to the ground state of the stable well , the zeeman energy is released to phonons ( heat ) which diffuse to neighboring molecules and thermally stimulate further reversal .",

    "the minor species relaxes prior to and independently of the major species .",

    "the overall behavior of avalanches of the major and the minor species , each acting alone , can largely be understood with the help of eq .",
    "[ arrhenius ] .",
    "the blocking temperature is the temperature above which the spins can freely reverse on the time scales relevant to the experiment and is closely related to the relaxation rate .",
    "turning on the heater results in slow heating of the crystal until the temperature approaches the blocking temperature , at which point the spins can reverse and an avalanche may occur . since the relaxation rate is much higher for the minor species , we expect that the ignition threshold should be lower .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) showing much lower ignition temperatures for the minor avalanches than the major species avalanches .",

    "the minima in the major avalanche ignition temperatures at the fields @xmath49 t , @xmath28 t , and @xmath50 t correspond to a reduction of the major species barrier by quantum tunneling .",
    "this decrease in the ignition threshold was discussed at some length for these data in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at first glance",
    "one may attribute the minima in the minor ignition temperatures to a similar process of quantum tunneling at the resonant fields relevant to the minor species . however , this is not so .",

    "the vertical black lines drawn on fig . [ fig6 ] indicate the center of the minor species resonance fields . for fields below @xmath53 t ,",
    "the entire minor species magnetization reverses during an avalanche .",

    ", all the minor species magnetization has relaxed , precluding the possibility of igniting an avalanche .",
    "similarly , the avalanche speeds for the minor species exhibit behavior that should not be confused with quantum enhancement of the avalanche speed .",
    "the apparent peak in the minor avalanche speeds occurs at a lower field than the minor species tunneling resonance . as the field is increased and approaches the minor species resonance near @xmath51 t , a portion of the minor species magnetization relaxes prior to the ignition of the avalanche .",
    "this loss of magnetization is equivalent to the loss of fuel available to burn in chemical deflagration , which leads to slower speeds .",
    "non - monotonic behavior is also observed for the avalanche speeds of the _ major _ avalanches .",
    "although small at low fields , there is an apparent increase of speed at @xmath50 t and @xmath55 t , consistent with quantum tunneling of the majority spins .",
    "these major avalanche data were presented and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar quantum enhancement of the avalanche speed should also be present for the minor avalanches ; however , it is overwhelmed by the effect of the loss of magnetization prior to ignition . in order to observe the quantum enhancement of avalanche",
    "speeds in either species of avalanche , one must create conditions that eliminate the pre - ignition losses by preparing the magnetization at lower temperatures or sweeping the external field at a faster rate .",
    "the theory of magnetic deflagration of garanin and chudnvosky @xcite gives an approximate formula for the speed of propagation of a planar deflagration front , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the temperature reached at the front , @xmath58 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath59 is the spin relaxation rate ( eq . [ arrhenius ] ) , and @xmath60 is the barrier against spin reversal .",
    "applying procedures reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can obtain a fit to the theory for the major species avalanches as follows .    in order to calculate @xmath57 for a particular avalanche ,",
    "we require the average energy released per molecule and the heat capacity .",
    "the average energy released per molecule as it relaxes is proportional to the zeeman energy , @xmath61 the parameter @xmath62 is introduced to account for avalanches with different fractions of initial metastable spins .",
    "for instance , if all spins ( both major and minor ) relax during the avalanche , then @xmath63 ; if the fully magnetized major only ( minor only ) species relaxes during an avalanche then @xmath64 @xmath65 . given @xmath66 , the maximum possible temperature ( @xmath67 ) during an avalanche",
    "is calculated as the upper limit of the following integral : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the specific heat capacity per molecule @xcite .",
    "for the major species avalanches , values of @xmath67 are obtained that range from @xmath70 to @xmath71 k. since the density of minor species is small , @xmath67 for the minor species avalanches ranges between @xmath72 and @xmath73 k. we assume the heat loss through the surfaces of the crystal are negligible , therefore @xmath74 .    the barrier for the major species molecules , @xmath75 , is calculated from the spin hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] .",
    "the magnetization , @xmath9 , produces an internal field of @xmath76 mt that has a clear effect on the avalanche speeds ( as evidenced by fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we take into account its effect on @xmath75 by setting @xmath77 mt , where @xmath78 is the externally applied field .",
    "omitting the data at resonant magnetic fields ( where the avalanche speeds are enhanced by quantum tunneling ) these calculated values for the major species avalanches are used to obtain the fit to eq .",
    "[ eom ] shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) .",
    "the thermal diffusivity was allowed to vary with temperature as @xmath79 ; based on results obtained by applying this analysis to an extensive data set ( see @xcite ) , we set the exponent @xmath80 and obtained a  best \" fit for @xmath81 m@xmath39/s .",
    "a similar procedure used to fit the available data for the minor species avalanches yields a thermal diffusivity that has a temperature dependence @xmath82 with @xmath83 . as shown by the dashed lines in figure [ fig6 ] ( b ) ,",
    "two separate fits are applied : at low fields , all the minor species molecules are available and relax during the avalanche , and we estimate that @xmath29 , while at higher fields approximately half the minor spins have relaxed prior to ignition and @xmath31 .",
    "there is a large error associated with applying this analysis to the minor species , as the minor species spin density is known only approximately and there are fewer data points than for the major species .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the temperature dependence one deduces by fitting to the theory is sharply positive , with a temperature exponent that is substantially greater than @xmath84 .",
    "this is quite unexpected , as thermal diffusivity generally decreases with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the fact that , for both major and minor species avalanches , fits to the theory of magnetic deflagration of garanin and chudnovsky @xcite produce thermal diffusivities that @xmath85 with temperature suggests that assumptions we used in the analysis may be unwarranted , or that the theory is incomplete in its present form .",
    "we now examine the data obtained for the combined avalanches , where both major and minor species relax during the avalanche . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the magnetic data for an avalanche triggered at @xmath16 t show that a small amount of relaxation precedes the large peaks due to the major species avalanche .",
    "this precursor is the reversal of the spin magnetization of the minor species just before that of the major species .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the separation of the two species as reflected in the temperature profiles .",
    "for all samples measured , the two species do not relax simultaneously during an avalanche below a field on the order of @xmath86 t which varies from crystal to crystal . at low fields the minor species relaxes prior to and independently of the major species , while above this field the major species and minor species ignite together and propagate as a single front ; the transition between these two regimes appears to be discontinuous .",
    "it is analogous to grass and trees that can sustain separate burn fronts that abruptly merge into a single front when the grass becomes sufficiently hot to ignite the trees .",
    "this interesting behavior warrants further investigation @xcite .",
    "the presence of the minor species in the combined avalanches significantly lowers the ignition threshold as well as increasing the avalanche speed .",
    "in fact , as shown in figs . [ fig7 ]",
    "( b ) and ( c ) , the ignition temperatures and speeds for the combined avalanches are nearly equal to those of the minor avalanches .",
    "this suggests that the presence of the metastable minor species acts as a catalyst for the major species in analogy with the behavior of a catalyst in a chemical reaction .",
    "a close look at the ignition temperatures of the minor avalanches and the combined avalanches in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( b ) , reveals similar minima .",
    "this is due to the loss of minor species magnetization prior to the ignition of the avalanche .",
    "however , the minima occur at different fields . in the following section , we make the analogy with a catalyst more complete by explaining the shifts in the resonant fields between the minor and the combined avalanches .      the shift in the minor species resonant fields can be explained by carefully taking into account the dipolar field due to the major species .",

    "the locations of the tunneling resonances for the minor species are determined by the total field , @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the shift of the minor species resonance field relative to the middle curve is a direct measure of the dipolar field due to the fully magnetized major species , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 mt .    the shift due to @xmath95 is also reflected in the ignition temperatures and avalanche speeds shown in figs .",
