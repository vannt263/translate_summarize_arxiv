    "the recent precision measurement of the muon anomaly @xmath6   at the brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite has led to renewed interest in accurate measurements of the cross section for @xmath9 annihilation into hadrons .",
    "contributions to the photon spectral functions due to quark loops , are not calculable for low hadronic mass states because of the failure of perturbative qcd in such conditions .",
    "a very clean way out has been known for a long time  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the hadronic piece of the spectral function is connected by unitarity to the cross section for @xmath0hadrons .",
    "a dispersion relation can thus be derived , giving the contribution to @xmath6  as an integral over the hadronic cross section multiplied by an appropriate kernel .",
    "an example of a first complete estimate of the correction was given in 1985 , @xmath10=707(6)(17),-10 , @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath0  contributes 500 out of the 700 value above .",
    "the cross section for @xmath0  becomes negligible above 1 gev .",
    "the most recent measurements of ( @xmath0 ) in the energy interval 610@xmath11961 mev come from cmd-2 at novosibirsk . they claim a systematic error of 0.6% with a statistical error of 0.7% @xcite .",
    "their data have been used most recently together with @xmath12 and   data up to 3 gev , in an attempt to produce a firm prediction for comparison with the bnl result@xcite .",
    "there is unfortunately a rather strong disagreement between the @xmath13 value obtained using @xmath0  data and @xmath12 decay data , after isospin corrections .",
    "finally the @xmath0  based result disagrees by 3   with the bnl @xcite measurements .",
    "there are thus many reasons for new measurements of the  annihilation cross section into two pions .",
    "initial state radiation , isr , is a convenient mechanism which allows studying @xmath0  hadrons , over the entire energy range from 2@xmath14 to @xmath15 , the center of mass energy of the collision . in the case of interest",
    "it is potentially vitiated by the possibility of final state radiation . for a photon radiated before annihilation of the  pair ,",
    "the  system energy is @xmath16 , thus one measures the coupling to pions of an off - mass shell photon of mass m ( ) . for a photon radiated by the final state pions , the virtual photon coupling to the   pair has a mass @xmath15 . by just counting powers of @xmath17 , the relative probability of isr and fsr",
    "are equal .",
    "this requires very careful estimates of the two processes in order to be able to use the reaction @xmath0  to extract ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the karlsruhe group has given much attention to this problem and has also developed the eva and phokhara monte carlo programs @xcite - @xcite which are fundamental to our analysis . in the following",
    "we will refer to the invariant mass squared of the  system as @xmath18 .",
    "in general the  and  cross section are related through : @xmath19 integrating the cross section above , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 we get @xmath22 eq . [ eq : h ] defines the radiator function @xmath23 . in the following we will drop the variable @xmath24 which is a constant in the present work . the radiator function @xmath25 used in our analysis is obtained from the phokhara monte carlo program .",
    "our present analysis is based on the observation of ref.@xcite , that for small polar angle of the radiated photon , the isr process vastly dominates over the fsr process . at lowest order",
    "the  cross section diverges as @xmath26 , just like ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we limit ourselves in the following to studying the reaction @xmath0  with @xmath27 or @xmath28 . for small @xmath29 ,",
    "the di - pion system recoiling against a small angle photon will results in one or both pions being lost also at small angle .",
    "we are therefore limited to measuring ( ) for @xmath30550 mev",
    ". we will be able to investigate the cross section near threshold , as soon as next to leading order calculation for fsr become available .",
    "this is of great importance , since there are no recent , good measurements of ( ) at low mass , which weigh strongly in the estimate of @xmath13 .",
    "the kloe detector @xcite consists of only two elements : a large , precision drift chamber and an electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the detector design was optimized for @xmath31 study in neutral kaon decays , for k mesons produced in the decay of @xmath32 mesons almost at rest , @xmath3312.5 mev / c .",
    "the measurements reported in the following rely heavily on the drift chamber .",
    "its large dimensions , 4 m diameter , use of he and a magnetic field of 0.52 t allow measuring momenta and direction of charged particles with very high accuracy .",
    "because of our choice of accepting only events with @xmath34 , the photon does not reach the calorimeter .",
    "the two relevant parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath35 are obtained from the reconstructed tracks of events with two opposite charge particles forming a vertex near the  interaction point .",
    "the quality of the detector is fully described by the mass squared resolution and the resolution in measuring the production angle of single tracks or the angle of the vector sum of the two track momenta .",
    "we find @xmath360.2% for @xmath37=500 mev , without much change over the range studied and @xmath3810 mrad , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath41 for large angle tracks .",
    "the calorimeter still plays an important role in the measurement .",
    "its exceptional timing resolution , @xmath42 ps and high segmentation provide particle identification allowing us to distinguish pion from electrons and muons , as discussed later .",
    "it is also used in the luminosity measurement ,    the kloe detector is operated at , the frascati , running at @xmath43 mev .",
    "beams cross in  at an angle of 25 mrad , resulting in a momentum of the @xmath32 mesons of 12.5 mev / c along the @xmath44-axis .",
    "we use a coordinate system where the @xmath44-axis points to the center of the colliders , the @xmath45-axis bisects the two beam lines and the @xmath46-axis is vertical",
    ". the precise values of @xmath15 and @xmath33 is measured on a run by run basis using bhabha events , to accuracies significantly better than 100 kev .",
    "the rms machine energy spread is 350 kev , measured with  pairs in kloe .",
    "the excellent kloe resolution allows us to efficiently selected  events , without photon detection , because of their clean signature : two tracks from the interaction point .",
    "we assume that the event is of the type @xmath0@xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the undetected photon polar angle",
    ", @xmath50 is the angle with the @xmath45-axis of the vector -*p*+-*p*- .",
    "the fiducial volume for  events has been chosen in order to maximize the acceptance for  events due to isr .",
    "the main background processes are @xmath0@xmath0  and radiative bhabha scattering . at low mass",
    "the final state @xmath51 becomes important but requiring small @xmath35 removes most of this final state .",
    "we rely otherwise on kinematics and particle identification , i d , in order to reject the mentioned backgrounds to a negligible level . from studies with eva ,",
    "confirmed with phokhara , a good compromise for the fiducial volume is @xmath34 and @xmath52 for the polar angle of both tracks at the interaction point .",
    "these requirements ensure abundant statistics for the measurement and contamination of fsr hard radiation well below the 1% level .",
    "the efficiency for the events falling inside the fiducial cuts is contained in the value of the radiator , obtained from phokhara .",
    "we note that no detected photon is required , nor are events rejected if photons are present .",
    "the two tracks must form a vertex close to the interaction point .",
    "we require that the vertex coordinates @xmath53 satisfy @xmath54 cm and @xmath55 cm .",
    "we also require @xmath56 or @xmath57 mev / c to remove spiraling tracks .",
    "90 to 95% of the  events survive these requirements .",
    "this result is obtained from monte carlo studies and examination of @xmath0  decays .",
    "a fraction of radiative bhabha events , , survives kinematical selection , see sec .",

    "we have developed a particle i d method , using approximate likelihood estimators which are effective in distinguishing pion and electrons .",
    "the likelihood is based on time - of - flight vs momentum comparison and on the shape and magnitude of the energy deposits in the calorimeter by the charged particles .",
    "correlations , which are significant , between used variables are ignored .",
    "two likelihood functions have been built using actual data : one , @xmath58 to test the pion hypothesis and one for @xmath59 , since the energy deposition of the two particles is different , in particular at these energies .",
    "this is not necessary for electrons . ]",
    "( using @xmath60 events ) and the other , @xmath61 to test the electron hypothesis ( using bhabha events ) .",
    "we require that candidate pion tracks have a greater likelihood of being pions than of being electrons .",
    "we use as discriminating variable @xmath62 and we accept as pions particles with @xmath63 , see fig .",
    "[ likelihood ] .",
    "the efficiency for pions is 98% and 3% of the electrons survive rejection .",
    "we require that only one of the two particles satisfy the pion i d requirement ( or ) achieving an efficiency of 100% with some very small residual background .",
    "requiring that both tracks are pions ( and ) leads to a 5% loss .",
    "we use the and for evaluating backgrounds , see later .      for an @xmath64 final state lorentz invariance",
    "allows us to compute the mass of @xmath44 , which we call @xmath65 from @xmath66 for @xmath67 , the value of @xmath65 peaks at @xmath68 thus allowing selection of signal events .",

    "the signal events above the region @xmath71 mev are due to additional isr or fsr radiation .",
    "the cut on @xmath65 rejects a fraction of events with additional radiation .",
    "the implications are discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "data were taken in july through december 2001 , for an integrated luminosity of =140.7 pb . after fiducial volume and selection cuts we find 1.5,6 , events .",
    "[ fig : nraw ] gives the  mass squared distribution of the  events in bins of 0.01 gev in @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath72 peak and the @xmath72-@xmath73 interference structure are clearly visible , demonstrating the excellent mass resolution of the kloe detector . to obtain the cross section",
    ", we subtract the residual background from this spectrum and divide by the selection efficiency and the integrated luminosity :    @xmath74      the [ @xmath69 plane population of signal and background events is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtrkvsq2 ] .",
    "the amount of background in the signal region is obtained by fitting the @xmath65  spectrum of the selected events , in slices of @xmath18 with the @xmath65  spectra for signal , @xmath75  and @xmath76  events obtained from monte carlo simulation .",
    "an example of such a fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkg1 ] , left .",
    "background from @xmath77  events appears at higher @xmath65  values and the missing mass , @xmath78 , peaks at @xmath79 .",

    "the result of the fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkg2 ] which shows the relative contribution of the different backgrounds to the observed signal .",
    "the shape of the background distribution is well reproduced by the monte carlo simulation ensuring that systematic uncertainties are smaller than the fit errors .    other possible contributions , such as the reaction @xmath0  with the electrons going down the beam pipe , have been studied and shown to be negligible given our event selection criteria .",
    "the integrated luminosity is measured using large angle bhabha ( lab ) events , with the kloe detector itself .",
    "the effective bhabha cross section at large angles ( @xmath81 ) is about @xmath82 nb .",
    "this cross section is large enough so that the statistical error on the luminosity measurement is negligible .",
    "the number of lab candidates , @xmath83 , is counted and normalized to the effective bhabha cross section , obtained by monte carlo : @xmath84 the precision of this measurement depends on the correct inclusion of higher order terms in computing the bhabha cross section .",
    "we use two independent bhabha event generators : bhagenf ( @xcite , @xcite ) and babayaga ( @xcite ) . for each generator a systematic error of @xmath85 is quoted by the authors .",
    "the two result for the luminosity agree to better than 0.2% .",
    "lab events are selected with cuts on variables which are well simulated by the kloe monte carlo simulation .",
    "the electron and positron polar angle cuts , 55@xmath86125 , is based on the calorimeter clusters , while the energy cuts , @xmath87 mev , is based on drift chamber information .",
    "the background from @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath77 events is well below @xmath90 and is subtracted .",
    "all selection efficiencies ( trigger , emc cluster , dc tracking ) are @xmath91 and are well reproduced by the detector simulation program .",
    "we also obtain excellent agreement between the experimental distributions ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) and those obtained from monte carlo simulation , see fig .  [",
    "fig : bhabha ] .",
    "finally , corrections are applied on a run - by - run basis for fluctuations in the center - of - mass energy of the machine and in the detector calibrations .",
    "the experimental uncertainty in the acceptance due to all these effects is 0.4% .",
    "we assign a total systematic error for the luminosity of @xmath94 .",
    "an independent check of the luminosity measurement is obtained using @xmath0  events .",
    "we find agreement to within @xmath95 .",
    "these efficiencies have been obtained from control samples of ,  and  events selected without requiring the vertex .",
    "the efficiencies have been parameterized as a function of single track parameters ( charge , momentum and angle ) combined using monte carlo simulation .",
    "the largest source of systematic error in this procedure arises from the difference between the kinematics of the control samples and the signal .      .",
    "the efficiency for the @xmath96 cut has been evaluated from data by accepting one track and studying the distribution of the other one .",
    "the systematic error introduced by the @xmath96 cut is negligible , since we use the or ,  at least on particle is a pion , for which the efficiency is 100% for  events .",
    "the efficiency for the @xmath65 cut is obtained as a by - product of the residual background evaluation ; the result of the fit provides the efficiency in each @xmath18 bin .",

    "the @xmath65 efficiency has been obtained with our reference monte carlo simulation , which uses the phokhara version 1.0 generator .",
    "phokhara simulates the full nlo qed correction for  annihilation with the emission of additional photons from the initial state . in order to estimate the systematic effect due to the generator we have repeated the exercise using a different generator , babayaga ver.3.5 , the same generator used in the luminosity measurement . in this generator",
    ", isr is treated using the parton shower approach .",
    "the resulting value for the @xmath65 efficiency differs from that evaluated with phokhara by @xmath95 .",
