    "in the first phases following their formation , neutron stars are probably strongly magnetized and can emit intense electromagnetic dipole radiation at the expense of their rotational energy .",
    "these energy losses will produce a non ",
    "negligible radiation pressure on the surrounding medium , inhibiting any possible accretion of interstellar material ( see e.g. lipunov 1992 ) .",
    "after the radiation pressure has dropped , the flow penetrates inside the accretion radius , proceeding unaffected until the magnetospheric ( alfvn ) radius is reached , where the magnetic pressure becomes equal to the ram pressure of the infalling gas . at this point accretion can continue if the centrifugal acceleration exerted on the matter flowing along the field lines is smaller than the gravitational acceleration : in order to have accretion from the interstellar medium ( ism ) a relic magnetic field @xmath2 g and a rotational period greater than a few seconds are needed ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) , which are not implausible for old neutron stars ( onss ) .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , onss should appear as weak , soft x  ray sources , as firstly suggested by ostriker , rees & silk ( 1970 ) .",
    "the detection of onss is a long - sought goal of x  ray astronomy such that it was included as a possible target for the _ einstein _ mission ( helfand , chanan & novick 1980 ) , but the first systematic study of the observability of these sources with rosat was carried out by treves & colpi ( 1991 ) , who found that , in the most favourable case of polar cap accretion , thousands of onss should appear in the rosat pspc all sky survey .",
    "a complete analysis by blaes & madau ( 1993 ) essentially confirmed the results of treves & colpi ( 1991 ) .",
    "zane et al . ( 1995a ) reconsidered the detectability of onss with rosat and found that , for polar cap accretion , onss may contribute up to 10% of the unresolved x ",
    "ray background , although in this case about 10 sources deg@xmath3 should be observable by rosat at the sensitivity limit of @xmath4 c s@xmath1 .",
    "finally , in two recent investigations shemi ( 1995 ) and zane et al . (",
    "1995b ) have studied the detectability of nearby onss . to date ,",
    "good evidence for ons candidates has been presented by stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and walter , wolk & neuhuser ( 1996 ) , who found that two unidentified x  ray sources detected in either the _ einstein _ extended medium sensitivity survey or in the rosat all sky survey may actually be powered by an accreting ons .",
    "a different approach for the search of onss was suggested by blaes & madau ( 1993 ) and colpi , campana & treves ( 1993 ) , who indicate as a very promising environment for their detection nearby giant molecular clouds , where the density of the ism is sufficiently high for a single neutron star to emit a considerable amount of radiation .",
    "however , in this case also the absorption of the ism will be enhanced and the detectability will crucially rely on the delicate balance between the emitted luminosity and the absorbed flux . as shown by blaes & madau ( 1993 ) , colpi , campana & treves ( 1993 ) and zane et al .",
    "( 1995a ) , some molecular clouds in the vicinity of the sun are expected to contain a large number of onss emitting at relatively high rates and then representing the most favourable sites for the observability of these sources .    on the wake of these studies ,",
    "we have performed a systematic investigation of the x  ray sources detected by rosat pspc in the direction of two molecular clouds ( cygnus rift and cygnus ob7 ) , which should be particularly favourable as far as the expected number of onss is concerned .",
    "as we will see , the definition of a systematic searching strategy is very important when dealing with large number of sources and , to this end , the theoretical investigation of the expected emission properties turns out to be certainly a key ingredient .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      for the four sources with no optical counterpart , pspc count rates in the different bands have been extracted manually from the data , with an accurate estimate of the background , in some case contaminated by extended emission . the relevant information about the candidates ( two in each cloud ) can be found in table 5 .",
    "as it can be seen from table 4 , all four sources come from pointings with long exposure times and with a large number of gsc identifications , which ensures an accurate boresight correction .",
    "source ob72 lies just outside the outer rim of the cloud ( see figure 1 ) , but we decided not to discard it from the sample .",
    "7.7 truecm    source rift2 might have counterparts at different wavelengths .",
    "the poss plate shows a very faint ring ",
    "like structure ( @xmath5 diameter ) in the x  ray error box , reminiscent of a supernova remnant or a planetary nebula .",
    "the position of the source is compatible with that of the iras source 20179 + 4102 , which has a 100 @xmath6 m flux of 75 jy ( iras catalogs and atlases 1985 ) . putting the distance at 0.7 kpc , this translates roughly to a luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath1 . at the same distance",
    "the radius of the optical ring would be @xmath8 pc .",
    "if the ring and the iras sources were the same object , it would be too small and faint to be a supernova remnant , while the planetary nebula hypothesis could not be ruled out .",
    "in absence of a clear identification we do not exclude the source from our candidates list .",
    "as can be seen from tables 2 , 3 and 5 , our predicted number of sources is larger than the number of unidentified objects detected by rosat . in particular , figure 2 shows the expected number of onss and the observed number of unidentified objects in our sample as a function of threshold . by comparing the two curves , it is clearly visible that predictions are too `` optimistic '' , although it should be stressed that , by purpose , theoretical calculations have usually been performed under the most favourable assumptions .",
    "the fact that the observed number of ons candidates is smaller by a factor 310 indicates that the range of parameters of our model needs to be more constrained .",
    "as already discussed , there are several sources of uncertainties which may influence theoretical predictions , such as the velocity distribution and density of onss , the strength of the relic magnetic field ( related to the possible inhibition of accretion ) , the neutron star birth rate , the total number of onss , the indetermination in the exact value of the gravitational capture radius @xmath9 and the validity of the fluid approximation for the average ism .",
    "scattering by molecular clouds and spiral arms ( dynamical heating ; wielen 1977 ) may boost a fraction of low velocity stars to higher speeds , reducing the number counts up to an order of magnitude ( madau & blaes 1994 ) .",
    "also , evidence has been found ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ) for a neutron star mean birth velocity much higher than the one obtained by narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) .",
    "recently , blaes , warren & madau ( 1995 ) have shown that preheating of the ambient gas to temperatures higher than @xmath10 k may significantly reduce the accretion rate , hence decreasing the number of detectable objects .",
    "our onss searching strategy was aimed to select x  ray objects in molecular clouds which , within their error boxes , do not have any optical counterpart in the poss plates .",
    "additional information is clearly needed to assess the true nature of these objects .",
    "the detection of an x  ray pulsation in the range of 11000 s will clearly indicate that we are observing an ons ; however high magnetic fields are needed which could prevent accretion and could harden substantially the emitted spectrum ( see e.g. nelson et al .",
    "1995 ) , moving the peak emissivity outside the rosat energy range . in absence of x ",
    "ray pulsations , a spectral criterion could be used to individuate onss : in the case of low magnetized or unmagnetized onss we expect an x  ray spectrum which show a significant hardening with respect to a black body at the neutron star effective temperature , as discussed in zampieri et al .",
    "an additional feature could be a high column density , testifying that the x  ray object lies within ( or beyond ) the molecular cloud . as can be seen from tables 2 and 3 ,",
    "the expected hardness ratios for onss embedded in the clouds or beyond them are near to unity . in this respect ,",
    "the observed @xmath11 of three of our candidates are consistent with the hypothesis that the sources are located within the clouds , whereas one source ( rift1 ) can not certainly lie within the cloud because of its measured value of the hardness ratio @xmath12 ( see table 5 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that its spectral properties are consistent with those of a foreground ons located at @xmath13 100300 pc ( see also table 2a , @xmath14 c s@xmath1 ) .",
    "we checked that , at this distances , rift1 should not be detectable even at the lowest sensitivity limits ( @xmath15 c s@xmath1 ) of euve ds .    from the lack of optical counterparts in the digitized poss plates",
    ", we can estimate a lower limit for the observed x  ray to optical flux ratio ( @xmath16 ) for our ons candidates .",
    "the limiting magnitude in the regions of the four candidates is @xmath17 20 ; using the conversion to magnitude @xmath18 by king and raff ( 1977 ) we can adopt this limit as a conservative limit on @xmath18 , since only blue objects would break this assumption and the bluest unabsorbed stars have b  v=@xmath19 . for the conversion between rosat countrate and flux we adopted the relation by fleming et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , appropriate for sources of stellar nature .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath20 are between 0.4 and + 0.1 .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) use the value of @xmath16 as a chief criterion for determining the nature of the x  ray emitter .",
    "in addition to compact objects , high @xmath16 are associated also with bl lacs , cluster of galaxies , young supernova remnant and heavily extincted pre  main sequence stars . while an extragalactic origin seems unlikely for sources on the galactic plane in the direction of molecular clouds ,",
    "the other possibilities still can not be excluded .",
    "follow  up deep observations will be necessary to further investigate the nature of these ons candidates .",
    "in particular , deep x ",
    "ray pointings in the direction of these four sources would be very useful to measure with more precision the x  ray spectral properties .",
    "also , uv observations in the lex band of euve at the lowest sensitivity limits would be desirable to verify the absence of ultraviolet emission .",
    "finally , deep optical observations are certainly needed to search for the presence of possible fainter counterparts within their error circle and to put a better constraint on the @xmath16 ratio .",
    "in the calculation of the expected number of onss we have used the analytic approximation to the ons distribution computed by zane et al .",
    "( 1995a ) , which is based on the evolution of the f population ( characterized by the lowest value of the mean velocity ) of model b of narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) and on the assumption of a uniform spatial distribution of neutron stars : @xmath21\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the spatial volume integration element , @xmath23 pc@xmath24 is the number density of onss averaged in the local region around the sun ( @xmath25 kpc , @xmath26 pc ) , @xmath27 is the present total number of onss in the galaxy and @xmath28 is an analytic fit to the cumulative velocity distribution derived by zane et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .    the count rate ( measured at earth ) in a certain spectral interval ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) of a star which emits a monochromatic flux of radiation @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the distance of the source",
    ", @xmath34 is the absorption cross  section of the ism ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) and @xmath35 the hydrogen column density .",
    "@xmath36 is the effective area and @xmath37 the bandpass of the detector ( @xmath38 kev and @xmath39 kev for rosat pspc ) .",
    "clearly , at a certain distance @xmath40 an ons will be detectable if its count rate @xmath41 is above the sensitivity limit @xmath42 of the detector .",
    "then , at @xmath40 there exists a limiting value of the star luminosity , @xmath43 which depends on the emission properties and the absorption of the ism , below which an accreting neutron star does not give rise to a count rate above the threshold of the detector and hence is not observable .",
    "from equation ( 1 ) this translates directly into an upper limit for the star velocity , @xmath44 .",
    "alternatively , a star with a given luminosity @xmath45 , or velocity @xmath46 , will be observable up to a maximum distance @xmath47 at which @xmath41 goes below @xmath42 .",
    "then , the total number of onss which can be observed in a certain interval of distance [ @xmath40 , @xmath48 and within a solid angle @xmath49 can be calculated from equation ( a1 ) summing up all the neutron stars that are contained within the volume @xmath50/3 $ ] and integrating over @xmath46 : @xmath51 } & = & n_{ons}\\ , \\int_{v_{j+1}}^{v_j } v(v ) { { dg}\\over { dv } } dv + \\nonumber\\\\ & & + n_{ons } v(v_{j+1 } ) g(v_{j+1})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in equation ( a3 ) the integral goes from the maximum velocity of detectability at distance @xmath52 , @xmath53 , to the maximum velocity at @xmath40 , @xmath54 , whereas the second term on the right hand side accounts for all the stars with luminosity above threshold throughout all of the spatial volume considered .",
    "the integral has been evaluated numerically using a lobatto quadrature and @xmath47 has been interpolated at the appropriate value of @xmath46 from a table of entries previously calculated ( an extensive use has been done of a local cubic interpolation procedure ) .",
    "we note that for each threshold there exists an absolute upper limit to the distance of detectability which corresponds to the star with the minimum accretion velocity @xmath55 and maximum emitted luminosity .",
    "we note also that in each interval of distance [ @xmath40 , @xmath48 the ism density must be constant in order to ensure the regularity of the function @xmath47 and hence the correct computation of the integral .",
    "we have estimated the spatial boundaries @xmath56 and @xmath57 of cygnus rift and cygnus ob7 ( @xmath58 is the position of the cloud center ) by inverting for the cloud width @xmath59 the expression @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the cloud volume and @xmath62 its apparent angular surface ( taken from dame et al .",
    "1987 ; see also table 1 ) . using these boundaries , the expected number of onss in each cloud has been evaluated from equation ( a3 ) .",
    "moreover , with the same technique , it is possible to calculate also the expected number of foreground and background onss accreting from the average ism , which are seen in the direction of the clouds but are not embedded within them .",
