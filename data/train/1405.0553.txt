    "to derive the various boundary conditions , we consider two discrete time random walks . we implement the random walk process as follows : in each time step one of the random walks is chosen at random and it jumps left or right with equal probabilities . therefore , the coordinates @xmath108 and @xmath109 evolve according to @xmath110 consequently , the distances @xmath27 and @xmath28 change as follows @xmath111 when @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "to derive the diffusion equation @xmath112 with @xmath113 we write the recursion equation @xmath114 we now expand the left - hand as a first - order taylor expansion in time and the right - hand side as a second - order taylor series in space . the diffusion equation is subject to the boundary conditions @xmath115 these boundary conditions follow from the jump rules along the lines @xmath32 and @xmath31 respectively , @xmath116 in the second case , with probability @xmath117 , the second random random walk tries to overtake the maximum set by the first walker and thus , it is annihilated ( absorbed by the boundary @xmath31 ) .",
    "as function of the initial coordinates @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the probability @xmath120 satisfies a recursion equation analogous to @xmath121 leading to the diffusion equation for @xmath8 with @xmath113 .",
    "the boundary condition follows from the recursion @xmath122 to derive this equation , we have to take into account all relevant initial conditions where @xmath123 is the initial maximum .",
    "the first term corresponds to , the second to , and the third includes contributions from two initial conditions : and .",
    "of course , we are interested in the behavior along the line @xmath47 which corresponds to @xmath124 , but the problem is well defined for all @xmath125 , a region which lies entirely inside the first quadrant ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) in the @xmath118-@xmath119 plane . finally , we stress that in our reduced two - variable description , we `` integrate '' over the initial maximum @xmath123 ."

    "<S> our results thus far concern diffusion in one spatial dimension , yet closely related questions can be asked of brownian motion in arbitrary dimension @xmath103 . </S>",

    "<S> the notion of competing maxima could also describe the span of colloidal particles undergoing simple or anomalous diffusion @xcite .    in summary , we studied maxima of brownian particles in one dimension and found that the probability that such maxima remain ordered decays as a power law with time . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent characterizing this decay varies continuously with the diffusion coefficients governing the motion of the particles . </S>",
