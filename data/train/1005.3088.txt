    "in the scenario of emergent spacetime @xcite , the notions of spacetime and distance are not fundamental , but they are just infrared phenomena which appear only after underlying dynamics of fundamental degrees of freedom are averaged over . therefore , to compare the infrared dynamics of such a scenario with the conventional spacetime formulation of physics such as the general relativity ,",
    "it is necessary to give an appropriate definition of distance and derive the metric tensor field on an emergent spacetime .",
    "an explicit example of such a definition is given in the noncommutative geometry , where the notion of distance is defined through a laplacian or a dirac operator on a noncommutative spacetime @xcite .",
    "another example is given in the simplicial quantum gravity , where such operational definitions of distance have been used for comparisons with the general relativity @xcite .    because of the infrared character of the notion of distance , different operational definitions of distance are not generally identical in short distances but converge in long distances .",
    "this implies that a metric tensor field on an emergent spacetime could be derived more directly from application of a renormalization procedure to underlying small distance dynamics of fundamental degrees of freedom . in this paper",
    ", i will discuss a renormalization procedure for the tensor models , which are models of emergent space , and see how a metric tensor field emerges .",
    "the tensor models were originally proposed to describe the simplicial quantum gravity in more than two dimensions @xcite .",
    "although the subsequent developments @xcite have demonstrated some interesting connections to the loop and spin foam quantum gravities , the tensor models seem to have not yet become a fully successful approach under the original interpretation of the tensor models based on the diagrammatic relations between the tensor models and simplicial manifolds in more than two dimensions . in view of this status ,",
    "the author has proposed another interpretation of the tensor models as theory describing dynamics of fuzzy spaces @xcite .",
    "this reinterpretation has the following advantages compared with the original one .",
    "firstly , a three - tensor is enough to describe all the dimensional spaces .",
    "secondly , the semiclassical analysis of the tensor models can be considered to have the physical meaning that a classical solution and small fluctuations around it correspond to a background space and field theories , respectively .",
    "lastly , the diffeomorphism invariance of the general relativity can naturally be incorporated into the symmetry of the tensor models .",
    "indeed , the tensor models which are fine - tuned to possess classical solutions with certain gaussian forms have numerically been analyzed , and the agreement between the tensor models and the general relativity , but may be @xmath0 , or other invariants .",
    "] has been obtained in various dimensions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a first step to generalize the above results of the fine - tuned tensor models to more general tensor models .",
    "it will be proven that the gaussian configurations are the attractors of the three - tensor under a renormalization procedure .",
    "since these gaussian configurations can be parameterized by a scalar and a symmetric two - tensor , it will be argued that , in general situations , the infrared dynamics of the tensor models will be described in terms of scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "coupled field theories of the metric tensor and a scalar have been considered for various physical reasons @xcite .",
    "for example , motivated by mach s idea on inertial induction , the brans - dicke theory @xcite has a scalar field which plays as a variable gravitational  constant \" . in string theory , the dilaton field",
    "is necessarily introduced to keep the worldsheet conformal invariance after quantization @xcite .",
    "scalar fields are actively discussed to model the dark energy and the dark matters , which have clearly been shown to exist in the universe by recent astrophysical observations @xcite",
    ". therefore it will be highly interesting , if it is concluded that the tensor models necessarily generate a scalar field as well as the metric tensor field in their infrared dynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : tensor ] , the tensor models in this paper and the gaussian configurations are introduced . in section",
    "[ sec : renormalization ] , a renormalization procedure for the tensor models is introduced . in section [ sec :",
    "proof ] , it is proven that the gaussian configurations are the attractors of the three - tensor under the renormalization procedure . in section [ sec",
    ": example ] , two numerical examples are given for showing how configurations converge to gaussian configurations by iterations of the renormalization procedure . in section [ sec : scalartensor ] , it is argued that the infrared dynamics of the tensor models should be described in terms of scalar - tensor theories of gravity",
    ". the last section is devoted to summary , discussions and future directions . in appendix",
    "[ app : details ] , some details of the proof in section [ sec : proof ] are provided .",
    "the general idea of regarding the tensor models as theory describing dynamics of fuzzy spaces is based on the observation that a fuzzy space is characterized by an algebra of functions on it , @xmath1 @xcite . by considering the three - tensor @xmath2 to be a dynamical variable ,",
    "one can obtain the tensor models as theory of dynamics of fuzzy spaces .",
    "depending on the detailed choices of a dynamical variable and a symmetry , there exist various kinds of tensor models .    in this paper ,",
    "the dynamical variable of the tensor models is a totally symmetric real three - tensor @xmath3 , which satisfies [ eq : defc ] & c_abc , + & c_abc = c_bca = c_cab = c_bac = c_acb = c_cba .",
    "+ the tensor models are assumed to be invariant under the orthogonal transformation , [ eq : onsym ] c_abc = m_a^a m_b^b m_c^c c_abc ,  mo(n ) .",
    "then an example of an invariant action can be given by [ eq : action ] s=- c_abcc_abc+ c_abcc_dbcc_defc_aef- c_abcc_adec_bdfc_cef , where the repeated indices are assumed to be summed over , and @xmath4 are real coupling constants .",
    "this is one of the simplest actions , which is known to have a number of classical solutions corresponding to various dimensional fuzzy spheres and tori @xcite . in section [ sec :",
    "example ] , i will use its classical solutions as examples for applying the renormalization procedure introduced in section [ sec : renormalization ] .",
    "next , let me introduce the gaussian configurations @xcite . in concrete applications ,",
    "the indices of the three - tensor are taken to be discrete and finite , but , as ideal cases , let me assume the indices to be continuous and infinite in the following discussions . in the coordinate basis ,",
    "the gaussian configurations are defined to take the form , [ eq : cx ] c^g_x_1 x_2 x_3=b , where @xmath5 are @xmath6-dimensional coordinates @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive real constants , and @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a constant real symmetric two - tensor and is assumed to be positive - definite to demand exponential damping of @xmath12 at large mutual distances among @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is redundant in the sense that it can be absorbed into the rescaling of @xmath11 , but it will be kept for the later convenience to characterize the order of the fuzziness , @xmath13 , while @xmath14 .",
    "because of the obvious translational invariance of , it is more convenient to express in the momentum basis and @xmath15 . ] . by applying fourier transformation to the indices @xmath5 of , one obtains [ eq : cp ]",
    "c^g_p_1 p_2 p_3= a ^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a positive constant proportional to @xmath8 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the inverse of the matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the algebra of functions on a usual continuous space is given by @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath22 by identifying @xmath23 with the structure constant of the algebra , @xmath24 . in",
    ", the delta functions are smoothened by gaussian functions .",
    "in addition , ( or ) has the poincare invariance . thus the three - tensor ( or ) can be considered to represent a @xmath6-dimensional fuzzy infinite flat space @xcite .",
    "the philosophy of the kadanoff - wilson renormalization procedures is in iterations of coarse graining processes . in a discrete system ,",
    "such a process is generally a discrete step of defining new renormalized dynamical variables by averaging over contributions of underlying dynamical variables on nearby sites . on a fixed lattice , the meaning of nearby sites",
    "can obviously be defined by giving a renormalization scale , but in a gravitational system , one has to take into account the fact that a scale is a dynamical quantity determined by dynamical variables .",
    "hence , in analogy with a gravitational system , a renormalization step in the tensor models should be expressed solely by the dynamical variable , and it will generally take a form , [ eq : ren ] c^r_abc = r(c)_abc , where @xmath25 is a totally symmetric three - tensor as a function of @xmath2 , and @xmath26 is a new renormalized dynamical variable obtained after one step of a renormalization procedure .",
    "the @xmath27 symmetry is assumed to be respected in .",
    "in fact , there exist various possibilities of a renormalization procedure @xmath28 , but i assume that the qualitative behavior in the infrared limit will not depend on the details of the choice of @xmath28 , if it is taken appropriately .",
    "the simplest choice of @xmath28 @xcite is as follows .",
    "let me consider a configuration of @xmath2 which is not far from the gaussian form .",
    "then , if @xmath29 are nearby points , @xmath30 gives a function averaged over within the distance of order @xmath13 from @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , one can consider another averaged function @xmath31 , and take the product of these averaged functions , @xmath32 , which will determine a renormalized structure constant .",
    "contracting the unwanted indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one obtains a renormalized three - tensor as [ eq : renproc ] r(c)_abc = c_adec_bdfc_cef . note that this expression respects the @xmath27 symmetry .",
    "it is obvious that there exist various possibilities to insert @xmath23 into to change the detailed way of averaging over .",
    "i assume that these changes do not alter the essential properties of the infrared behavior of a renormalization procedure .",
    "i will show a numerical evidence for this robustness in section [ sec : example ] . in the following section ,",
    "i will discuss the simplest renormalization procedure .    in general , the renormalization procedure does not change the number of degrees of freedom , and",
    "hence this is not the same as the usual kadanoff - wilson renormalization procedure . but as will be discussed in section [ sec : scalartensor ] , after a number of iterations of the renormalization procedure , the degrees of freedom can be accumulated into a scalar and a two - tensor field .",
    "let me first discuss the uniqueness of the gaussian configurations up to the second order of momenta in the exponential , under the assumption of the momentum conservation .",
    "since @xmath35 must be totally symmetric , the most general expression up to the second order is given by [ eq : cpgen ] c_p_1p_2p_3=&a + & ^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are symmetric , and the momentum conservation is expressed by the delta function . because of @xmath38 , the sum in the first line vanishes .",
    "moreover , by using @xmath39 , the expression in the second line can be converted to that in the third line .",
    "thus is the most general expression up to the second order of momenta in the exponential .",
    "now let me apply the renormalization procedure to the gaussian configuration .",
    "noting that the contraction of indices must be taken for pairs of @xmath40 and @xmath15 in the momentum basis , one obtains r(c^g)_p_1p_2p_3&=c^g_p_1 q_1 q_2 c^g_p_2 -q_1 q_3 c^g_p_3 -q_2 -q_3 + & = a^3 ^d ( p_1+p_2+p_3 ) d^dq ( -(p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 + 2q^2 + 2(p_1+q)^2 + 2(p_2-q)^2 ) ) + & = a^3 ^ ( - ( p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 ) ) ^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) , where @xmath41 . is for @xmath11 , while @xmath42 . ]",
    "this expression is again a gaussian configuration , and the parameters @xmath43 are renormalized as [ eq : renaal ] a_r&=a^3 ^ , + _ r&= .",
    "this proves that the gaussian configurations or are on the trajectories of the renormalization procedure .    in the following ,",
    "i will show that the gaussian configurations are the attractors of the three - tensor under the renormalization procedure . for simplicity",
    ", let me assume that @xmath44 . this simplification does not ruin the generality of the discussions below , because a linear transformation of the momenta in can transform a general positive - definite @xmath20 to @xmath45 .",
    "let me consider a small deviation from the gaussian configurations in the form , [ eq : devc ] c_p_1 p_2p_3=a(1+f(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) ) ( -(p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2))^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) , where the function @xmath46 represents a deviation from , and must be symmetric with respect to its arguments .",
    "note that this deviation does not violate the translational invariance or the momentum conservation .",
    "the violating case will be discussed in section [ sec : scalartensor ] .",
    "now let me discuss the renormalization of the deviation @xmath46 .",
    "let me assume that the deviation is so small that the renormalization procedure can be approximated by the linear approximation in @xmath46 .",
    "the linear approximation is enough to see whether the gaussian configurations are attractive or not . applying the renormalization procedure to , one obtains [ eq : rendev ] r(c)_p_1p_2p_3&=c_p_1 q_1 q_2 c_p_2 -q_1 q_3 c_p_3 -q_2 -q_3 + & a^3 ^d ( p_1+p_2+p_3 )",

    "i consider an @xmath46 which contains only a finite number of polynomials of @xmath49 . in",
    "the coordinate basis , such a deviation corresponds to adding a finite number of polynomials of @xmath50 to the constant @xmath8 in .",
    "therefore such a deviation is local in the sense that it does not change the exponential damping behavior of @xmath51 at large mutual distances among @xmath5 .",
    "a general deviation with such damping behavior may have an expression with an infinite number of polynomials .",
    "but , because of the damping behavior , it will be enough to consider only the central region , and it will be possible to approximate a deviation with good accuracy by a finite number of polynomials . then the proof below will be applicable also for such general cases .    because of the momentum conservation @xmath38 , the expression of @xmath46 in terms of @xmath49 is not unique , that causes difficulties in the proof .",
    "this ambiguity can be avoided by expressing @xmath46 solely in terms of two of the momenta .",
    "since @xmath46 is symmetric with respect to the momentum arguments , there exist three equivalent expressions , each of which can be obtained from each choice of two momenta , as [ eq : fbyh ] & f(p_1,p_2,p_3)|_p_1+p_2+p_3=0 + & = f(p_1,p_2,(-p_1-p_2))=_m , n=0 m+n1^m+nm ^ h^_1  _m;_1 ",

    ", the integration over @xmath58 of each term will generate terms of lower or equal degrees .",
    "therefore the renormalization procedure closes with the form in , and it can be expressed as a linear transformation with an upper triangular matrix , [ eq : renlin ] (    h_r0 + h_r2 +   + h_rm    ) = (    r_00 & r_02 &  & r_0 m + 0 & r_22 &  & r_2 m + 0&0 & & + 0&0&0 & r_mm    ) (    h_0 + h_2 +   + h_m    ) , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 symbolically represent the coefficients of the terms of degree @xmath61 in @xmath46 as in and @xmath48 , respectively , and @xmath62 symbolically represents the sub - matrix relating @xmath63 to @xmath60 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the linear transformation determine whether the gaussian configurations are attractive or not under the renormalization procedure .",

    "thus the proof in section [ sec : proof ] will be applicable to each patch , and a number of iterations of the renormalization procedure on @xmath2 will result in a gaussian configuration on each patch",
    ". then the collection of the gaussian configurations of all the patches will define a gaussian configuration depending on locations in the whole space .",
    "such a generalized gaussian configuration may be expressed as [ eq : gaussgen ] c_x_1x_2x_3=e^(x_1)+(x_2)+(x_3 ) g(x_1)^14 g(x_2)^14 g(x_3)^14 ( -(d(x_1,x_2)^2+d(x_2,x_3)^2+d(x_3,x_1)^2 ) ) , where @xmath103 is a scalar field , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is the geodesic distance between @xmath5 and @xmath106 on a background of a metric tensor field @xmath107 .",

    "the comparison between the light modes in the tensor models and the general relativity has shown some remarkable agreements @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the discussions in this section show the possibility that a scalar field also appears in the infrared dynamics of the tensor models .",
    "thus , in general situations , the infrared dynamics of the tensor models will be described in terms of scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "then it becomes a question why a scalar field has not shown up in the previous analysis of the fine - tuned tensor models .",
    "this is probably because , while the fuzzy analogue of the diffeomorphism invariance coming from the symmetry of the tensor model constrains the two - tensor field to appear as a gauge field , the dynamics of the scalar field strongly depends on the details of the tensor models , and its appearance as a light mode is not always guaranteed .",
    "in this paper , i have discussed a renormalization procedure for the tensor models which have a totally symmetric real three - tensor as their only dynamical variable . it has been proven that configurations of certain gaussian forms are the attractors of the three - tensor under the renormalization procedure .",

    "are generally not local .",
    "then what is really assumed is that the non - local fluctuations are not important in the infrared dynamics of the tensor models .",
    "this is a problem of dynamics , which could be studied in numerical manners .    in this paper ,",
    "the dynamical variable of the tensor models is a totally symmetric real three - tensor .",
    "a natural extension of this is to consider a three - tensor satisfying the generalized hermiticity condition , which was considered in the original proposals of the tensor models @xcite .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to consider two real three - tensors , one of which is totally symmetric and the other is anti - symmetric .",
    "thus this extension will inevitably introduce an anti - symmetric two - tensor field by similar discussions as in this paper .",
    "then the whole content of fields will agree with the massless fields in the bosonic string theory @xcite .",
    "it would be highly interesting to study the properties of this new field to see whether this agreement is just an accident or has more meaning .",
    "another interesting direction is to apply the renormalization procedure to the actual analysis of the tensor models .",
    "as explained at the end of the previous section , it is presently not clear why a scalar field has not shown up in the previous analysis of the tensor models which are fine - tuned to have gaussian classical solutions @xcite .",
    "probably this is because the scalar field can appear as a light field only on limited conditions . in this regard",
    ", the tensor model with the action will be interesting to study , because it is known to have various physically interesting classical backgrounds without fine - tuning of the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the model will also be interesting as an example to study the characteristics of the scalar - tensor theories describing the tensor models .",
    "the forms of scalar - tensor theories of gravity depend on the physical motivations @xcite . among them ,",
    "the idea of brans - dicke @xcite seems very interesting in the present context , because , in the scenario of emergent spaces and gravity , the gravitational constant will be a dynamical quantity which will be determined not only by a background spacetime but also by matter distributions .",
    "in this appendix , for @xmath112 , i will explicitly obtain all the independent forms of the functions @xmath113 , which are symmetric with respect to @xmath49 and are defined only on the momentum conserved plane , @xmath38",
    ". then @xmath114 is computed by to obtain the eigenvalues of @xmath74 .        apparently , for @xmath76",
    ", there exist two functions which are symmetric with respect to @xmath49 as [ eq : k2app ] f_1(p_1,p_2,p_3)&=h_1^ ( p_1p_1 + p_2p_2 + p_3p_3 ) , + f_2(p_1,p_2,p_3)&=h_2^ ; ( p_1p_2 + p_2p_3 + p_3p_1 ) .",
    "however these are not independent , because , by substituting @xmath115 into , these functions turn out to have the same form as f_1(p_1,p_2,-p_1-p_2)&=2 h_1^ ( p_1p_1 + p_2p_2 + p_1p_2 ) , + f_2(p_1,p_2,-p_1-p_2)&=-h_2^ ; ( p_1p_1 + p_2p_2 + p_1p_2 ) .",
    "thus there exist only one independent form . substituting @xmath116 into ,",
    "one finds f_1r^equal(p_1,p_2,-p_1-p_2)=()^ f_1(p_1,p_2,-p_1-p_2)=f_1(p_1,p_2,-p_1-p_2 ) .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath117 are 1 .      for notational simplicity ,",
    "let me first introduce some short - hand notations , p^3&h^ p_p_p _ , + ( p_1 ^ 2 , p_2)&h^ ; p_1p_1p_2 , and so on",
    ". these are convenient , because one can compute without taking so much care of the tensors @xmath53 .",
    "the following formulas hold as usual : ( p_1+p_2)^3&=p_1 ^ 3 + 3p_1 ^ 2 p_2 + 3p_1 p_2 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 3 , + ( ( p_1+p_2)^2,p_3)&=(p_1 ^ 2 + 2p_1p_2+p_2 ^ 2,p_3)=(p_1 ^ 2,p_3)+2 ( p_1p_2,p_3)+(p_2 ^ 2,p_3 ) , where @xmath118 , and so on . with these notations , there exist two apparently independent forms , [ eq : fk31 ] f_1&=&p_1 ^ 3+p_2 ^ 3+p_3 ^ 3=-3 ( p_1 ^ 2p_2+p_1p_2 ^ 2 ) , + f_2&=&(p_1 ^ 2,p_2)+=(p_1 ^ 2,p_2)+2(p_1p_2,p_1+p_2)+(p_2 ^ 2,p_1 ) , [ eq : fk32 ] where i have used @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , @xmath116 and @xmath119 are not independent , because , by substituting @xmath120 into , one can derive the same form as .",
    "thus it is enough to consider only @xmath119 , and , by substituting it into , one obtains f_2r^equal=()^ f_2 .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath121 are @xmath80 .      with similar simplified notations as above ,",
    "there exist three apparently different forms , f_1&=p_1 ^ 4+p_2 ^ 4+p_3 ^ 4=2(p_1 ^ 4 + 2p_1 ^ 3p_2 + 3 p_1 ^ 2 p_2 ^ 2 + 2p_1p_2 ^ 3+p_2 ^ 4 ) , + f_2&=(p_1 ^ 3,p_2)+ + & = -2(p_1 ^ 3,p_1)-2(p_2 ^ 3,p_2)-(p_1 ^ 3,p_2)-(p_2 ^ 3,p_1)-3(p_1p_2(p_1+p_2),p_1+p_2 ) , + f_3&=(p_1 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2)+ + & = ( p_1 ^ 2,p_1 ^ 2)+(p_2 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2)+3(p_1 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2)+2(p_1p_2,p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2 ) , where i have used @xmath122 , which comes from @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , @xmath116 can be obtained from @xmath119 by substituting @xmath124 , and therefore is not independent .",
    "another substitution of @xmath125 into @xmath119 results in a new form , f_4=(p_1 ^ 2,p_1 ^ 2)+(p_2 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2)+(p_1 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2)+2(p_1p_2,p_1p_2)+2(p_1p_2,p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2 ) .",
    "of course , this @xmath126 is not an independent form because this is derived from @xmath119 . but",
    "as will be shown below , this form is needed to express @xmath127 .",
    "for this reason , it is convenient to divide the whole space of the form @xmath119 into the form of @xmath126 and the rest , and regard @xmath126 as an independent form . by subtracting @xmath128 from @xmath126 ,",
    "one obtains a simpler expression , f_5=(p_1 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2)-(p_1p_2,p_1p_2 ) .",
    "thus there exist three independent forms , @xmath129 , where @xmath130 denotes the rest of @xmath119 explained above .",
