    "the proof of ( [ ubd ] ) is more involved and depends on estimating the survival probability of a somewhat complicated `` superdual '' process .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ tdecay ] is completed at the end of section  [ sdecay ] .",
    "systems with cooperative branching , but different death mechanisms have been considered before in the literature .",
    "in particular , noble @xcite and neuhauser @xcite have studied a `` sexual reproduction process '' in which particles perform cooperative branching ( but no coalescence ) and die with constant rate .",
    "the name of this process is a bit misleading since it does not distinguish organisms with different sexes .",
    "an interesting feature of it is that the corresponding mean - field model exhibits a first order phase transition , which is reflected in meta - stable behavior of the spatial model with strong mixing or long - range interaction .    in the physics literature , considerable attention has been paid to the `` pair contact process '' where again the reproduction mechanisms is cooperative branching , but the death mechanism is annihilation ( two particles are simultaneously removed ) . whether this model belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class is the subject of ongoing debate @xcite .",
    "our motivation for studying the cooperative branching - coalescent is multifaceted . as detailed below , we regard the model as an interesting toy model in and by itself , both from a biological and mathematical perspective . in addition , the model is of relevance due to connections to other interesting models for which it is potentially harder to prove the results that we can obtain here .    from a purely mathematical perspective , the cooperative branching - coalescent is interesting because of the critical behavior in the extinction phase ( proved in theorem  [ tdecay ] ) , which sets it apart from more usual models exhibiting a phase transition between extinction and survival , such as the contact process .",
    "this criticality arises from the fact that extinction is driven by coalescence alone , a property presumably shared with other models that are more difficult to treat .    from a biological perspective , we have two , rather different motivations for studying cooperative branching .",
    "first of all , interpreting particles as organisms , we may view the cooperative branching - coalescent as a model for population dynamics .",
    "the assumption that only pairs of individuals can reproduce is , of course , rather natural .",
    "although usually , the members of such a pair need to be of opposite sex ( a fact not incorporated in our model ) , there are in fact quite a lot of organisms ( such as snails ) that are hermaphroditic , that is , each individual plays the role of both sexes , but that do not self - fertilize . in this interpretation ,",
    "the random walk dynamics models dispersal of organisms while the coalescence represents a death rate that is quadratic in the local population size .",
    "such a quadratic death rate naturally models deaths due to competition between individuals for limited space and resources @xcite .    to make the model more realistic , one could ( as in @xcite ) also add a linear component in the death rate , representing spontaneous deaths that are not due to competition with other individuals . doing so would , however , radically change the properties of the model . in particular , this would destroy the validity of theorem  [ tdecay ] and presumably yield a model in the universality class of the contact process .",
    "for these reasons , we have chosen not to do this .",
    "our second biological motivation for considering the cooperative branching - coalescent comes from the study of balancing selection ( sometimes also called heterozygosity selection or negative frequency dependent selection ) .",
    "this is the that genetically similar individuals often compete more strongly with each other than with genetically more different individuals .",
    "this could , for example , be due to the fact that genetically more different individuals need a somewhat different set of resources for survival .    in order to model this effect ,",
    "neuhauser and pacala @xcite introduced a variation of the voter model in which types that are locally in the minority have an advantage ( due to the presumed smaller competition with neighbors ) .",
    "a very similar model , dubbed the `` rebellious voter model , '' was introduced in @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations backed up , in part , by rigorous mathematics ( see @xcite and references therein ) have shown that typically , such models in dimensions @xmath131 tend to have an invariant law in which both types are present for all values of the selection parameter , but in dimension one undergo a phase transition between noncoexistence and coexistence as the selective advantage for locally rare types is increased .",
    "proving the existence of this phase transition , and in particular the existence of the noncoexisting phase , has proved to be difficult , however . both through duality and by considering the corresponding `` interface model '' ( as explained in @xcite )",
    ", noncoexistence can be shown to be equivalent to the extinction of a branching  annihilating particle system , where single particles give birth to two offspring at once , and pairs of particles annihilate each other , with certain rates .",
    "such systems are parity - preserving ( i.e. , even / oddness of the initial number of particles is conserved ) , so extinction needs to be interpreted as starting from even initial states , since odd systems can never die out completely .",
    "these systems are similar to the cooperative branching - coalescent in the sense that single particles can not die , and hence extinction relies on the recurrence of one - dimensional random walk .",
    "it seems that in the extinction regime , these systems effectively behave like a small perturbation of annihilating random walks without branching . in particular",
    ", it seems likely that their density and survival probability ( started from an even number of particles ) decay like @xmath132 , just as for the cooperative branching - coalescent ( theorem  [ tdecay ] ) .",
    "contrary to the cooperative branching - coalescent , however , none of these statements are proven .",
    "this is mainly due to two difficulties .",
    "first , these parity - preserving branching ",
    "annihilating particle systems are not monotone , so the usual coupling arguments fail , and in general one does not even know if increasing the branching rate makes survival more likely ( although this is certainly what one sees in all simulations ) .",
    "second , in a parity - preserving branching ",
    "annihilating particle system , single particles can still branch , even though most of the particles created in such branchings are believed to be quickly lost again due to annihilation .",
    "this is related to the problem of ( strong ) interface tightness for the rebellious voter model , which has recently been shown to imply noncoexistence @xcite ( although it remains an open problem to show either occurs ) .    using the results of our present paper",
    ", we can describe a simple variation of a one - dimensional voter model in which rare types have an advantage and for which the existence of a phase transition between noncoexistence and coexistence can be proved .",
    "consider a one - dimensional , nearest neighbor multitype voter model in which initially each site has a different type .",
    "we assume the usual voter model dynamics , that is , the type of each site is updated with rate one , at which event it is replaced by the type found on either side immediately to the left or right of it , with equal probabilities . in addition , with rate @xmath48 , we assume that each singleton , that is , each site that is occupied by a type that occurs nowhere else , gives birth to a completely new type which is placed on one of its neighboring sites , with equal probabilities . let @xmath133 denote the type of site @xmath41 at time @xmath21 in this model .",
    "then a little thinking convinces one that @xmath134 defines a cooperative branching - coalescent with cooperative branching rate @xmath69 , started in the fully occupied state .",
    "note that @xmath135 is the set of interfaces of @xmath136 , that is , boundaries where different types meet",
    ". now theorem  [ tphase](a ) together with ( [ upper ] ) show that @xmath136 tends in law to a constant configuration for @xmath137 but to an invariant law in which different types coexist for @xmath107 .",
    "this model is obviously somewhat artificial since it depends crucially on the nearest - neighbor property of the interaction , which implies that at all times each type present in the population occupies a single interval .",
    "moreover , the assumption that singletons give birth to a _",
    "new _ type is not well motivated from the biological point of view .",
    "nevertheless , the general behavior of the model seems to be similar to that of other , better - motivated models with balancing selection such as the rebellious voter model of @xcite .",
    "in fact , we may view the model we have just described as a variation on the rebellious voter model in which interface tightness and monotonicity of the interface model have been built in artificially .",
    "as such , we hope that it may also shed some light on this and similar models .",
    "in this context we should also mention another related one - dimensional model , the cooperative caring double branching annihilating random walk ( ccdbarw ) , that was recently introduced and analyzed by blath and kurt in @xcite and that partially motivated our present paper . in this model , new particles can only be created by clumps of at least two particles at neighboring sites .",
    "in contrast to our cooperative branching - coalescent they are created in pairs ( double branching ) on either side of the clump .",
    "in addition , particles perform a random walk . unlike in our model , particles that land on the same site do not coalesce but annihilate each other .",
    "the dynamics of the ccdbarw are somewhat complicated and contrary to the cooperative branching - coalescent it can not be started in infinite initial states .",
    "one of its motivations is that it demonstrates rather dramatically the nonmonotonicity of the classical dbarw , another parity - preserving branching  annihilating system .",
    "blath and kurt showed that the ccdbarw has parameter ranges for survival as well as for extinction , which implies that at least one phase transition between survival and extinction must occur .",
    "( however , note that due to lack of monotonicity in this model a scenario with multiple phase transitions can not be ruled out . )",
    "the cooperative branching - coalescent has certain nice properties , such as monotonicity ( see lemma  [ lmonot ] ) , which allow us to give rather short proofs of theorems  [ tphase ] and [ tdecay](a ) . beyond these basic facts ,",
    "however , many questions concerning the model remain open and seem to require a substantially bigger effort to be solved .",
    "one of the difficulties of the cooperative branching - coalescent is the lack of a simple dual model , such as one has for the contact process ( which is self - dual ) or for the rebellious voter model @xcite . a result by gray @xcite that holds for general attractive spin systems implies that the cooperative branching - coalescent has a dual taking values in the set of finite collections of finite subsets of @xmath18 , but this is a fairly complicated process to work with .",
    "in the present paper , we content ourselves with a process that is only a `` subdual '' ( as explained in section  [ stermin ] below ) , which nonetheless shows that some properties of the full dual can be controlled and which also provides the basis of the proof of our theorem  [ tdecay](b ) .",
    "we intend to discuss the relation of our subduality with gray s full dual in a separate paper .",
    "much progress in the understanding of cooperative branching - coalescents can be expected from a better understanding of the full dual process .    in this section , we list and discuss a number of open problems concerning the cooperative branching - coalescent .",
    "generalize theorems  [ tphase ] and [ tdecay ] to higher dimension .",
    "it is not hard to define generalizations of the cooperative branching - coalescent to higher - dimensional lattices @xmath138 @xmath139 . for such models , the basic lemmas  [ lmonot ] and  [ lsubad ] will remain true , and also theorem  [ tphase ] can probably be generalized without too much difficulty . in transient dimensions",
    "@xmath140 , a bit of care is needed in defining survival , since it is possible that two or more particles separate forever .",
    "the right definition of survival now seems to be that with positive probability there are pairs of particles at neighboring positions at arbitrary late times .",
    "generalizing theorem  [ tdecay ] to higher dimensions is less straightforward since even for the pure coalescent it is known that the decay of the density has a different asymptotics now , namely @xmath141 in @xmath142 and @xmath143 in dimensions @xmath140 ; see @xcite .",
    "prove equality @xmath112 of the critical parameters from theorem  [ tphase ] .",
    "even an inequality in either way would be interesting here .",
    "for the contact process , the analogous result is a simple consequence of self - duality , which is not available here .",
    "one possible approach is through the following problem .",
    "prove that survival implies a positive edge speed .    here",
    ", a positive edge speed means that for the process started with only the negative axis occupied , @xmath144 this sort of a result could potentially be used to set up a comparison with supercritical oriented percolation .",
    "this is related to the work of bezuidenhout , gray and grimmett @xcite and @xcite , which , however , does not easily generalize to our model because of the lack of positive correlations .",
    "a more modest problem is whether @xmath107 or @xmath110 ( or both ) imply a positive edge speed .",
    "prove any estimate for the critical exponent associated with the density of the upper invariant law or the survival probability .",
    "this looks like a hard problem but any argument that allows one to compare with the contact process ( believed @xmath116 ) or rebellious voter model ( conjectured @xmath145@xmath146 , see the discussion in @xcite ) would be valuable .    for @xmath107",
