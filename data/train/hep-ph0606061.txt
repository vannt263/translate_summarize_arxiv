    "<S> we point out that , if r - parity is broken spontaneously , the neutralino can decay to the final state majoron plus neutrino , which from the experimental point of view is indistinguishable from the standard missing momentum signal of supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the regions of parameter space where this decay mode is dominant and show that they are independent of r - parity conserving susy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , ( a ) only very weak limits on r - parity violating couplings can be derived from the observation of missing momentum events and ( b ) at future collider experiments huge statistics might be necessary to establish that r - parity indeed is broken . </S>",
    "<S> parameter combinations which give calculated relic neutralino density larger than the measured dark matter density in case of conserved r - parity are valid points in this scenario and their phenomenology at the lhc deserves to be studied .    </S>",

    "<S> valncia + edificio institutos de paterna , apt 22085 , e46071 valencia , spain + 6@xmath0 june 2006    is r - parity broken ? </S>",
    "<S> undoubtedly , a definite , affirmative answer to this question would have profound implications for both , particle physics and cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> low - energy precision data can be used to derive limits on r - parity violating ( ) couplings @xcite , but experimental proof that r - parity indeed is broken can only come from the observation of a decaying lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) at a future collider experiment .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present and discuss a scenario with spontaneously broken r - parity where the model can be easily confused with the usual minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with conserved r - parity despite the fact that the lsp decays within a typical detector of present and future high energy experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate here on neutral lsps as this is the case which has been studied mostly by experimental groups . however , in principle the lsp could be charged and quasi - stable on collider time scales and , thus , be observable .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose supersymmetric particles exist with masses , such that they can be produced at the lhc . to obtain evidence that the lsp decays , </S>",
    "<S> at least the following two conditions need to be met : ( i ) the decay length should not be ( much ) larger than the size of a typical detector . and , ( ii ) a minimum percentage of lsp decays , the exact number depending on the susy spectrum and the luminosity of the collider , of course , should lead to visible final states . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to estimate that neutralino ( @xmath1 ) lsp decay lengths , for typical susy masses in the vicinity of @xmath2(100 ) gev , drop below @xmath3 m for couplings larger than - very roughly - @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> condition ( ii ) , however , is more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> consider the lepton number violating part of the _ explicit _ superpotential @xcite @xmath5 together with the corresponding bilinear soft terms , @xmath6 for trilinear , final states of @xmath1 decays always involve either two quarks and/or charged leptons . in bilinear , scalar neutrino vacuum expectations values ( vevs ) induce couplings such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which lead to the decay @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically @xcite , however , the branching ratio of this mode is always br(@xmath10 ) @xmath11 , since ( a ) br@xmath12 and ( b ) the coupling @xmath7 necessarily is @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in explicit condition ( ii ) is automatically fulfilled .    _ spontaneous _ violation of r - parity ( s- ) @xcite , on the other hand , implies the existence of a goldstone boson , usually called the majoron ( j ) . in s - the neutralino can then decay according to @xmath14 , i.e.  completely invisible . </S>",
    "<S> below we will show that this decay mode can in fact easily be the dominant one , with branching ratios very close to 100 % . from the point of view of accelerator phenomenology , models with spontaneous violation of r - parity thus can resemble the mssm with conserved r - parity and huge statistics might be necessary before it can be established that r - parity indeed is broken .    before turning to the details of the calculation , </S>",
    "<S> two more comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , experiments on solar and atmospheric neutrinos have shown that neutrinos have non - zero masses and mix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many models have been proposed , which potentially can explain these data . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of lepton number violation in inevitably implies majorana neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> thus , significant _ upper _ bounds on most parameters follow from oscillation experiments @xcite as naturally implies a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> even the simplest bilinear model can explain measured neutrino masses @xcite , as can s- @xcite , if some specific combinations of parameters obey certain _ lower _ bounds , see below . in our numerical calculations </S>",
    "<S> we will always use parameters fitted to neutrino physics . </S>",
    "<S> a short comment on how our results are affected by other choices of parameters is given near the end of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , recent wmap data @xcite have confirmed the existence of non - baryonic dark matter and measured its contribution to the energy budget of the universe with unprecedented accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> because the neutralino as a dark matter candidate is lost , most advocates of susy declare undesirable . </S>",
    "<S> however , this does not mean that in models with , the dark matter problem could not be solved . </S>",
    "<S> possible dm candidates in are ( i ) light gravitinos @xcite , ( ii ) the axion @xcite or ( iii ) its superpartner , the axino @xcite , to mention a few .    turning to the definition of our model , we note that early versions of spontaneous used the left sneutrinos to break lepton number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models are now ruled out by lep and astrophysical data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model we consider @xcite therefore extends the mssm by three additional singlet superfields , namely , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with lepton number assignments of @xmath18 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential can be written as @xcite @xmath19 the first three terms are the usual mssm yukawa terms . </S>",
    "<S> the terms coupling the lepton doublets to @xmath15 fix lepton number . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the field @xmath17 with the higgs doublets generates an effective @xmath20-term a l next to minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last two terms , involving only singlet fields , give mass to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , once @xmath21 develops a vev .    for simplicity we consider only one generation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> adding more generations of @xmath15 or @xmath16 does not add any qualitatively new features to the model . </S>",
    "<S> note also , that the superpotential , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : wsuppot ] ) , does not contain any terms with dimension of mass , thus potentially offering a solution to the @xmath20-problem of supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the soft supersymmetry breaking terms of this model can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic guiding principle in the construction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : wsuppot ] ) is that lepton number is conserved at the level of the superpotential . </S>",
    "<S> however , at low energy , i.e.  after electro - weak symmetry breaking , various fields acquire vevs . besides the usual mssm higgs boson vevs @xmath22 and @xmath23 , these are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> . note , that @xmath28 generates effective bilinear terms @xmath29 and that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 violate lepton number and r - parity spontaneously .    once r - parity is broken , majorana neutrino masses are generated . </S>",
    "<S> after some algebraic manipulations one can express the effective ( 3,3 ) neutrino mass matrix in seesaw approximation as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : eff ] ) resembles closely the structure found for the neutrino mass matrix in the explicit bilinear model at the one - loop level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the field content of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : wsuppot ] ) the spontaneous model produces two non - zero neutrino masses already at tree - level . note , </S>",
    "<S> that the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 go to zero ( and thus one of the two neutrino masses vanishes at tree - level ) in the limit when either @xmath39 _ and _ @xmath40 vanish or , equivalently , @xmath41 _ or _ @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrino physics puts a number of constraints on the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for the current paper the exact details are unimportant , however , the most essential constraint for the following discussion is that both , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are small . </S>",
    "<S> if some of the singlet fields are light , i.e.  have masses in the range of @xmath47 tev , @xmath46 can be as small as @xmath48@xmath49 ( implying @xmath50@xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other extreme , independent of the singlet spectrum , @xmath46 can not be larger than , say , @xmath52 , due to contributions from sbottom and stau loops to the neutrino mass matrix @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the requirement that @xmath53 , together with the assumption of @xmath54 , can be used to find a rather simple expression for the majoron , in the basis @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that neutrino data ensures @xmath54 even for @xmath30 as small as @xmath58 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the majoron in our model is mainly a gauge singlet . </S>",
    "<S> constraints from the measurements of the invisible width of the @xmath59 boson @xcite as well as all astrophysical bounds @xcite are therefore easily satisfied . note , that the majoron has no component in the @xmath21 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the lightest neutralino , the neutrinos and the majoron in general is a complicated function of singlet and doublet parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the limit @xmath60 one can derive a simple approximation formula , given by @xmath61 here , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the matrix which diagonalizes the neutrino mass matrix at tree - level . </S>",
    "<S> the dots in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : majcl ] ) stand for higher order terms . </S>",
    "<S> equation([eq : majcl ] ) serves to show that for constant @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 as @xmath30 goes to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> this is as expected , since for @xmath68 the spontaneous model approaches the explicit bilinear model . </S>",
    "<S> note , that only the presence of the field @xmath69 is essential for the coupling eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : majcl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath16 is absent , replace @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations presented below are done with the program package spheno @xcite , extended to include r - parity violation . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the singlet states of the model are too heavy to be produced at future collider experiments such that only mssm particles are observed . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the smallness of the parameters guarantees that r - parity violating decay modes of all supersymmetric particles can be neglected except for the lsp and that also susy particle production cross sections are completely mssm - like . </S>",
    "<S> we will study only points where the lightest neutralino @xmath71 is the lsp .     </S>",
    "<S> for msugra parameter point sps1a @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) same points , decay length versus @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main result of the current paper.,title=\"fig:\",width=321,height=226 ]   for msugra parameter point sps1a @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this is the main result of the current paper.,title=\"fig:\",width=321,height=226 ]    -120 mm ( a )    ( b )    as can be seen from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : majcl ] ) , adjusting @xmath44 and @xmath32 from neutrino data , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eff ] ) , one expects that the most important parameters for the decay @xmath72 are @xmath73 and , equivalently , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : sumvis](a ) we plot the sum over the branching ratios of neutralino decays containing at least one visible particle in the final state as a function of @xmath74 , for fixed values of all other parameters except @xmath7540 tev . for this plot </S>",
    "<S> all mssm parameters were chosen in such a way that the sparticle spectrum as well as all production cross sections very closely resemble the values of the spa point spsa1a @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this point one expects about 2.5 @xmath76 neutralinos at the lhc for a total luminosity of 300 fb@xmath77 . as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sumvis](a ) demonstrates , the total number of events with at least some visible energy in the final state drops in this example below 100 ( 10 ) for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note , that in any susy event there are two @xmath71 and that with such small branching ratios at most one of them decays visibly . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , establishing that the @xmath71 decays at the lhc becomes challenging .    for completeness , in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this is potentially in conflict with an interesting feature of this model , namely the invisible decay of the lightest doublet higgs boson into two majorons @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : higgsinvis ] we show the ratio @xmath89 for the same points as shown in fig .  </S>",
