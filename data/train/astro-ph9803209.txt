    "interest in the effect of hard uv and x - ray radiation on stellar atmospheres and stellar evolution began in earnest with work on x - ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , but the subject has since been revisited in the context of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .    consider a star of effective temperature @xmath2 and an agn of luminosity @xmath3 .",
    "the incident power per area from the agn is equal to @xmath4 at the `` heating '' distance @xmath5 heating of the stellar surface by the agn is important at distances @xmath6 .",
    "fabian ( 1979 ) was apparently the first to suggest that heating by agn radiation might substantially affect the envelopes of nearby stars , resulting in enhanced mass loss . edwards ( 1980 ) argued that when a star approached within @xmath6 , the irradiated photosphere would develop supersonic horizontal winds carrying heat from the illuminated hemisphere to the shadowed side .",
    "edwards conjectured that enhanced mass loss could then occur , resulting in a `` cometary star '' as the stellar outflow is accelerated radially away from the agn .",
    "matthews ( 1983 ) noted the importance of direct radiation pressure from the agn , arguing that this could ablate matter tangentially from the stellar photospheres of giant or supergiant stars .",
    "voit & shull ( 1988 ) discussed the effects of x - rays on the upper atmosphere of a star near the agn .",
    "they argued that x - ray heating of a @xmath7 @xmath8 star ( @xmath9 ) would result in a hot , ionized wind , with temperature at the critical point @xmath10 ; radiation pressure in c iv , n v , and o vi resonance lines would contribute to the acceleration of the wind .",
    "they concluded that stars which are already red supergiants could develop winds with @xmath11 , where the distance from the agn is @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "these mass loss rates exceed normal mass loss rates for red supergiants only within a distance of @xmath14 .",
    "they estimated the mass loss due to ablation by radiation pressure ( @xcite ) for a @xmath15 star to be @xmath16 provided @xmath17 .",
    "there has also been some exploration of how agn radiation might affect the evolution of stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . tout et  al .",
    "discussed the evolution of stars immersed in a blackbody background with temperature @xmath18 , concluding that the main sequence evolution is largely unaffected , but that the star will expand to a radius @xmath19 times larger than usual during the `` red giant '' phase of evolution .",
    "note , however , that the energy density of agn radiation equals a @xmath20 blackbody at a distance of only @xmath21 from the agn .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear how their conclusions would have to be modified for the anisotropic and nonthermal radiation field of the agn .",
    "these discussions of the effects of agn radiation on stellar atmospheres and evolution have led some to consider a `` bloated stars scenario '' ( bss ) to explain the origin of the agn broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "the bss proposes that the blr consists of the stellar winds and/or expanded envelopes of stars irradiated with agn radiation ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the attractiveness of this scenario stems from its efficient use of known resources : stars are believed to be present near the `` central engines '' of agn , their gravity provides a possible `` containment '' mechanism for blr clouds , there is ample mass with which to replenish the clouds , and the mass shed provides material to fuel the agn .",
    "so far , however , no specific model has successfully explained how all these mechanisms might function , though pieces of the puzzle have been explored ( @xcite ) .",
    "high signal / noise measurements of line profiles indicate that the number of discrete clouds or bloated stars must be large , perhaps exceeding @xmath22 for mrk  335 ( arav et  al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath23 for ngc  4151 ( arav et  al .",
    "such large numbers appear to challenge the bss , but the difficulties may not be insurmountable .",
    "recent observations and photoionization models of baldwin et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) and ferland et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) offer some concrete evidence for the bss .",
    "they find that the blr seems to contain several distinct components .",
    "one ( component `` a '' ) has sharp ( fwhm @xmath24 ) , symmetric line profiles centered on zero velocity , while another ( component `` b '' ) appears to be outward - flowing , peaked at zero velocity but with a long blue tail ( down to @xmath25 ) .",
    "they interpret `` a '' as the expanded envelopes of stars , and `` b '' as their radiatively accelerated , outflowing winds .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to call attention to the fact that irradiation of a star by hard x - rays from the agn will result in the generation of lyman-@xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) photons within the stellar atmosphere , and the pressure of these trapped resonance - line photons may contribute to mass loss .",
    "the possible importance of ly@xmath0  photons was suggested previously by puetter [ unpublished , cited in penston ( 1988 ) and voit & shull ( 1988 ) ] .",
    "voit & shull rejected puetter s suggestion , arguing that the ly@xmath0  pressure could be estimated to be @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the equivalent width of the ly@xmath0  absorption profile of the gas between the point of interest and the surface , and @xmath28 is the gas temperature .",
    "voit & shull then used @xmath29 to obtain an upper limit @xmath30 which , for stars of interest , is insufficient to `` bloat '' the atmosphere . however equation ( [ eq : pvoitshull ] ) presumes the radiation field within the gas to be close to a blackbody at the gas temperature @xmath28  an assumption which need not be valid when ly@xmath0  photons are being generated within the gas by nonthermal processes , such as h(1s@xmath312p ) excitation by photoelectrons and secondary electrons in a non - maxwellian `` tail '' to the electron energy distribution function .",
    "it is therefore essential to estimate the rate of production of ly@xmath0  photons , and to examine their diffusion in physical space and frequency space as well as the possibility of photon `` destruction '' by , for instance , collisional de - excitation of electronically excited h atoms .    in  [ sec - linetrans ]",
    ", we give a brief treatment of resonance - line transfer , extending the detailed calculations of neufeld ( 1990 ) .",
    "in particular , we derive an expression for the case of a semi - infinite , absorbing slab of material .",
    "since resonance - line photons created in a stellar atmosphere will almost certainly not be able to scatter through the entire star without being absorbed , this limit is an excellent approximation . in  [ sec - model ] , we apply our calculational method to a simple , plane parallel , irradiated model atmosphere . in  [ sec - results ] , we present the results . in  [ sec - summ ] we summarize and discuss implications and further directions for work .",
    "most current photoionization treatments , including cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) , use the escape probability approximation to address resonance - line radiation transfer . for example , elitzur and ferland ( 1986 ) use the escape probability approximation ( epa ) to derive the frequency - integrated radiation intensity @xmath32 for a resonance line at frequency @xmath33 , corresponding to a transition from level @xmath34 to level @xmath35 , to be @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the planck function at the line excitation temperature ( which is calculated from the level populations ) and @xmath38 is the line width . the radiation pressure @xmath39",
    "is given , as usual , by @xmath40 in this purely local treatment , the escape probability approximation assumes that a resonance photon at a point @xmath41 has a probability @xmath42 per scattering of `` escaping '' to a defined boundary @xmath43 , where it is assumed photons free - stream to infinity .",
    "thus , the differential radiation pressure @xmath44 at any point @xmath41 is given by @xmath45    confusingly , it is this _ differential _ radiation pressure which elitzur and ferland ( 1986 ) and cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) refer to as the `` line radiation pressure . '' we will always use the term `` pressure '' and the symbol @xmath46 for the physical pressure ( momentum flux ) at point @xmath41 due to particles @xmath47 such as gas particles or resonance line photons .",
    "we will use the term `` differential pressure '' and the symbol @xmath48 for the pressure difference due to particles @xmath49 between the point of interest @xmath41 and the boundary point @xmath43 .",
    "elitzur and ferland ( 1986 ) note that the line width @xmath38 is the `` crucial parameter '' in this calculation of the radiation pressure .",
    "in particular , it is not well understood how to calculate @xmath38 at extremely large optical depths when the escape probability is comparable to the `` destruction probability '' per scattering , for example due to collisional de - excitation .    however , the case of very large optical depth is precisely that which neufeld ( 1990 ) considers using a completely different approach .",
    "he presents in  ",
    "23 of his paper an _ exact _ and _ analytic _ calculation derived from fourier transforming a diffusion equation .",
    "he solves this equation for a unit delta - function photon source in a uniform , optically thick ( but finite ) slab , with and without a finite destruction probability .",
    "in particular , at optical depth @xmath50 with a source at @xmath51 , the angle - averaged intensity @xmath52 and frequency - integrated intensity @xmath53 are given in terms of infinite series [ e.g. , his equation ( 2.7 ) ] . unfortunately , these series converge rather slowly .",
    "however , we show below that if we take the limit of a semi - infinite slab , then the angle - averaged intensity @xmath52 can be expressed in terms of analytic functions which can be integrated numerically with relative ease .",
    "below , we first present the notational conventions we use , and then proceed with our derivation of the intensities @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the case of a semi - infinite slab .",
    "neufeld ( 1990 ) defines @xmath56 as the ratio of the natural line width to the doppler width and @xmath50 as the mean optical depth : and @xmath57 used by neufeld ( 1990 ) , harrington ( 1973 ) , and other workers : @xmath58 where @xmath59  is the absorption cross section at line - center . ]",

    "consider a slab of total thickness @xmath80 .",
    "for a ly@xmath0  emissivity per unit volume @xmath81 , we define the injected power per unit area per unit optical depth as @xmath82 the excitation temperature @xmath83 at optical depth @xmath50 is found by integrating @xmath54 near line center over all source locations @xmath84 , weighted by @xmath85 , to obtain the total intensity at line center , and comparing with a blackbody intensity : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the usual planck function at the excitation temperature @xmath83 , evaluated at line center . since the majority of scatterings occur near line center , the local level population for ly@xmath0  should be given by @xmath88 where the @xmath89 s are the level populations , @xmath90 s are the statistical weights , and @xmath91 .",

    "hence , it is the scattering in the damping wings of the line profile , which does not significantly affect the level population but which greatly affects the line width , which is inaccurately calculated by cloudy in the escape probability approximation . in comparing the excitation temperature to the kinetic temperature , we see from figure  7 that there is a region of column density @xmath194 in which @xmath83 exceeds @xmath195 by a factor @xmath196 . hence , the naive estimate of the radiation pressure using equation ( [ eq : pvoitshull ] ) may be as much as a factor of @xmath197 too small .    our objective has been to carry out an exploratory investigation of the importance of ly@xmath0  pressure in the atmosphere of a star which is being irradiated by an agn .",
    "this study has involved a number of simplifying approximations . in particular , we have treated the atmosphere as plane - parallel with normally - incident irradiation ; this , of course , precludes examination of the important streaming effects which appear likely to ensue from the transverse pressure gradients which must arise from the non - uniform irradiation of the stellar surface .    in view of the neglect of the transverse pressure gradients and resulting motions , we have not iterated to a fully self - consistent solution .",
    "our hydrostatic equilibrium is obtained using cloudy s estimate for the radiation pressure rather than our more accurate result for @xmath182 . nor have we addressed the issue of stability or included radiation pressure from lines other than ly@xmath0  and from the star s own luminosity .    with these numerous simplifications , we find that in low gravity stars , the differential pressure due to ly@xmath0  can rise to @xmath19% of the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "we have developed a formalism for computing the ly@xmath0  pressure in a plane - parallel stellar atmosphere .",
    "the treatment of resonance - line trapping given in  2 can be incorporated into already developed stellar atmosphere codes . for conditions",
    "believed representative of the blr ( ionizing flux of @xmath198 ) , stars with @xmath186 will develop an appreciable pressure due to trapped ly@xmath0   photons in their atmospheres .",
    "we have neglected numerous complicating factors , all of which appear likely to enhance the rate of mass loss .",
    "first of all , the gravitational acceleration @xmath199 , rather than the assumed @xmath200 . as a result",
    ", the outer layers of the atmosphere will have a larger scale height and must ultimately go over into a thermal wind , even if the lower layers are essentially hydrostatic and stable . with the outer layers of the atmosphere photoionized and heated to @xmath201 , a fluid element will have positive enthalpy at @xmath202 .",
    "furthermore , we have neglected the radiation pressure due to resonance lines other than ly@xmath0 , as well as the radiation from the star itself .",
    "ferland ( 1997 ) reports that including radiation pressure from all resonance lines rather than just a select few sometimes increases the total radiation by an order of magnitude ( using cloudy s escape probability approximation , of course ) . since no part of our derivation in  2 depends explicitly on the resonance line being ly@xmath0 , it is straight forward to extend our calculation to include other resonance lines .",
    "most important , however , is the fact that except along the `` axis ''  the line from the center of the star to the agn  the atmosphere will be subject to substantial tangential stresses due to three effects related to anisotropic irradiation by the agn :    1 .   the momentum deposited by absorbed photons  at anywhere other than the axis",
    ", the momentum will have a tangential component ; 2 .",
    "transverse gradients in the ly@xmath0  pressure  at any particular radial column density @xmath164 , the ly@xmath0  production rate will be greater along the axis , where x - rays are entering radially ; and 3 .",
    "transverse gradients in the gas temperature  the rate of x - ray heating will be largest along the axis , where the zenith angle is zero .",
    "these tangential stresses must result in significant tangential flows , with flow velocities that might approach escape speeds along the `` terminator , '' perhaps resulting in a `` cometary star '' as envisioned by edwards ( 1980 ) and matthews ( 1983 ) .",
    "it would obviously be of great interest to calculate axisymmetric fluid - dynamical models of red giant atmospheres subject to intense x - ray irradiation in order to investigate the effects of tangential stresses .",
    "it should be noted , of course , that we lack a quantitative theory for mass loss even from unperturbed evolved stars , so we are hardly poised to develop a definitive treatment including this new complication .",
    "nevertheless , it does appear likely that trapped ly@xmath0  may help drive mass loss in low-@xmath90 stars subject to intense x - ray irradiation .",
    "the extra ly@xmath0  radiation pressure and associated tangential stresses might induce such evolving stars to `` bloat '' further and lose mass prematurely , so that the population of stars near the agn core could be skewed from the average throughout the galaxy .",
    "finally , we note that none of our calculations are dependent on the gravitating object being a star .",
    "recently , walker and wardle ( 1998 ) have suggested the existence of a population of cool , self - gravitating clouds in the galactic halo to account for `` extreme scattering events '' which occur in monitoring the flux of compact radio sources .",
    "they propose clouds of approximately a jovian mass with a radius of about an au , which would correspond to a gravitational acceleration @xmath203 at the `` surface . '' with a total column density of @xmath204 , the majority of the agn energy flux would be absorbed well before reaching ( and disrupting ) the center of the cloud .",
    "the proposed particle number density of @xmath205 corresponds well to that inferred by ferland et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) and baldwin et  al .",
    "thus if these self - gravitating , sub - stellar clouds exist in host galaxies of agn , they seem to be potential candidates for the origin of the blr .",
    "it is unclear , though , how they could exist with a high metal content , as required by blr observations , without rapidly cooling and collapsing ( in much less than a hubble time ) prior to exposure to agn irradiation .",
    "although we conclude that x - ray induced ly@xmath0  pressure would not be significant for main sequence stars near agn , it could be important either for lower gravity stars which have evolved off the main sequence up the giant branch , or for substellar , self - gravitating clouds .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the resulting cometary structures can account for the required blr covering factor and cloud population , and the agn mass supply .",
