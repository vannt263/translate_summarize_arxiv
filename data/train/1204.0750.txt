    "given  @xmath4 and a bounded open set @xmath5 with @xmath6-boundary , the @xmath0-perimeter of a ( measurable ) set @xmath7 in @xmath2 is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the complement of  @xmath1 , and @xmath10 denotes the following nonlocal interaction term @xmath11 here we are using the standard convention for which @xmath12 if either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "this notion of  @xmath0-perimeter and the corresponding minimization problem were introduced in  @xcite ( see also the pioneering work  @xcite , where some functionals related to the one in   have been analyzed in connection with fractal dimensions ) .",
    "recently , the @xmath0-perimeter has inspired a variety of literature in different directions , both in the pure mathematical settings ( for instance , as regards the regularity of surfaces with minimal @xmath0-perimeter , see  @xcite ) and in view of concrete applications ( such as phase transition problems with long range interactions , see  @xcite ) . in general , the nonlocal behavior of the functional is the source of major difficulties , conceptual differences , and challenging technical complications .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for an introductory review on this subject .",
    "the limits as  @xmath3 and  @xmath15 are somehow the critical cases for the @xmath0-perimeter , since the functional in   diverges as it is . nevertheless , when appropriately rescaled , these limits seem to give meaningful information on the problem .",
    "in particular , it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath16 approaches the classical perimeter functional as  @xmath15 ( up to normalizing multiplicative constants ) , and this implies that surfaces of minimal @xmath0-perimeter inherit the regularity properties of the classical minimal surfaces for  @xmath0 sufficiently close to  @xmath17 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "as far as we know , the asymptotic as  @xmath3 of  @xmath18 was not studied yet ( see however  @xcite for some results in this direction ) , and this is the question that we would like to address in this paper .",
    "that is , we are interested in the quantity @xmath19 whenever the limit exists . of course",
    ", if it exists then @xmath20 since @xmath21    we will show that , though  @xmath22 is subadditive ( see proposition  [ t1 ] below ) , in general it is not a measure ( see proposition  [ t2 ] , and this is a major difference with respect to the setting in  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath22 is additive on bounded , separated sets , and it agrees with the lebesgue measure of @xmath23 ( up to normalization ) when  @xmath1 is bounded ( see corollary  [ cor ] ) . as we will show below , a precise characterization of  @xmath24 will be given in terms of the behavior of the set  @xmath1 towards infinity , which is encoded in the quantity @xmath25 whenever it exists ( see theorem  [ tf ] and corollary  [ cor ] ) .",
    "in fact , the existence of the limit defining  @xmath26 is in general equivalent to the one defining  @xmath22 ( see theorem  [ tf1](ii ) ) .    as a counterpart of these results",
    ", we will construct an explicit example of set @xmath1 for which both the limits  @xmath24 and  @xmath27 do not exist ( see example  [ exx ] ) : this says that the assumptions we take can not , in general , be removed .",
    "also , notice that , in order to make sense of the limit in  , it is necessary to assume that for any  @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , if  @xmath29 is smooth , then   is always satisfied . ]",
    "@xmath30 to stress that   can not be dropped , we will construct a simple example in which such a condition is violated ( see example  [ ex2 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we collect the precise statements of all the results we mentioned above .",
    "section  [ sec_proofs ] is devoted to the proofs .",
    "we define  @xmath31 to be the family of sets  @xmath7 for which the limit defining  @xmath24 in   exists . we prove the following result :    [ t1 ] @xmath22 is subadditive on  @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 for any @xmath1 , @xmath33 .    first ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the normalized lebesgue measure  @xmath34 , that is the standard lebesgue measure scaled by the factor @xmath35 , namely @xmath36 where , as usual , we denote by @xmath37 the @xmath38-dimensional sphere .",
    "now , we recall the main result in  @xcite ; that is ,    [ thm_ms](see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) ) .",
    "let @xmath4 .",
    "then , for all @xmath39 , @xmath40    an easy consequence of the result above is that when  @xmath41 and  @xmath42 then  @xmath24 agrees with  @xmath43 ( in fact , we will generalize this statement in theorem  [ tf ] and corollary  [ cor ] ) .",
    "based on this property valid for subsets of  @xmath2 , one may be tempted to infer that  @xmath22 is always related to the lebesgue measure , up to normalization , or at least to some more general type of measures .",
    "the next result points out that this can not be true :    [ t2 ] @xmath22 is not necessarily additive on separated sets in  @xmath44 , i.e. there exist @xmath45 such that @xmath46 , but @xmath47 .",

    "there is a natural condition under which  @xmath24 does exist , based on the weighted volume of  @xmath1 towards infinity , as next result points out :    [ tf ] suppose that @xmath53 for some @xmath54 , and that the following limit exists @xmath55 then  @xmath56 and @xmath57where @xmath58    as a consequence of theorem [ tf ] , one obtains the existence and the exact expression of @xmath24 for a bounded set @xmath1 , as described by the following result :    [ cor ] let  @xmath1 be a bounded set , and @xmath53 for some @xmath54",
