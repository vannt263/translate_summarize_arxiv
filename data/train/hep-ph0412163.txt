    "the known 3 - 3 - 1 models proposed nearly twelve years ago are good candidates to describe some new phenomena we expect to see in the near future @xcite .",
    "they offer a novel phenomenology like , for example , being an appropriate framework to study in details bilepton through @xmath7 production in linear colliders @xcite , also within other observational capabilities @xcite .",
    "they provide a natural theoretical explanation to the families replication problem .    despite these and other curious features the early model versions present a severe limitation .",
    "the problem is that , like in any standard model gauge group extension , they predict a bunch of new particles .",
    "if from one side we have a base for computing new states production , on the other side we must worry about the consequences of the additional degrees of freedom .",
    "new particles already arising at the tev scale affect significantly the coupling evolution with energy .",
    "in fact , even if these states do not appear directly as on shell states , their degrees of freedom effectively contribute to the dynamics according to the renormalization group equations .",
    "this problem is particularly dramatic in the model versions we shall discuss here .",
    "such versions belong to the class of 3 - 3 - 1 models where the third component in the lepton triplet is a positive charged particle @xcite . there",
    "the su(3)@xmath0u(1)@xmath1 gauge coupling constants , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , are linked by the following relation involving the electroweak mixing angle @xmath10 @xmath11 this relation is valid above the energy scale @xmath12 where all symmetries become evident inside this theoretical framework .",
    "evidently , the symmetry breakdown su(3)@xmath0u(1)@xmath13 su(2)@xmath0u(1)@xmath2 has to be postulated to have occurred when a scalar field @xmath14 condensates with @xmath15 .",
    "but eq . ( [ polo ] ) requires @xmath16 , which is in accordance with direct measurement .",
    "( [ polo ] ) when confronted with the current value @xmath17 @xcite gives rise to a trouble in these models .",
    "the point is that their su(2)@xmath0u(1)@xmath2 effective theory has almost the same standard model minimal particle content , apart from few additional scalar multiplets .",
    "therefore , the renormalization group equation solutions in this case show us that @xmath18 increases with energy .",
    "it means that eq .",
    "( [ polo ] ) points to a nonperturbative regime at energy values which we shall be just interested .",
    "the equation defines the initial value @xmath19 and since it comes from an abelian group it also increases with energy , being close to one for energies around few tev in the minimal models .",
    "consequently it is a serious problem for the perturbative approach and it could make the models less appealing .    for example , running @xmath20 with only the minimal standard model representation content we see that it reaches the value @xmath21 at the energy scale @xmath22 tev @xcite .",
    "a study of perturbative limits in 3 - 3 - 1 models was carried out in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that perturbation theory can not be used already above scales of few tev if we consider the minimal versions with or without supersymmetry .",
    "there are some 3 - 3 - 1 constructions which do not have the problem above @xcite .",
    "but the ones considered here account for doubly charged bileptons intermediating processes where partial lepton number is violated , representing a very distinct signal to search for @xcite .",
    "other aspects and recent work on these models can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "it is proposed an additional matter content to the early 3 - 3 - 1 models where perturbative treatment can be applied without such tight restrictions .",
    "we see that the simplest representations to be added to the minimal versions are four octets , three of vectorial leptons plus and a scalar one . with them",
    "there is a prediction of a decreasing behavior for @xmath20 in a certain range of energy .",
    "the new exotic leptons are interesting also from the phenomenological point of view under the standard model gauge group in the see - saw mechanism @xcite , and also under the extended group we consider here @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] we study the renormalization group equations to understand how the nonperturbative limit appears in the minimal models .",
    "we then define a condition which should be satisfied in the model extensions , in order to make them perturbatively safe .",
    "we , then , justify the choice of the new representations content to be introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec : running ] we show how the perturbative limit is raised in two 3 - 3 - 1 models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : deces ] it is suggested a possible decoupling off all the scalars for energies below @xmath23 . we finish in sec .",
    "[ disc ] with the discussion of our results .",
    "at the su(2)@xmath0u(1)@xmath2 energy scale the renormalization group equations dictating the running of the gauge couplings at one loop level are given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the coupling constants of the su(2)@xmath27 , u(1)@xmath2 groups , respectively .",
    "the third equation involving the qcd coupling constant is irrelevant for our purposes here at this approximation level , and so it will not enter in our developments . as we have said above , for posterior use in the context of the 3 - 3 - 1 models we denote the gauge coupling constants @xmath28 for the groups su(3)@xmath27 , u(1)@xmath1 , respectively . in a generic gauge group",

    "for @xmath42 we use @xmath43 where @xmath44 for the standard model and @xmath45 for the 3 - 3 - 1 models .",
    "below @xmath23 the @xmath20 running is then , according to the standard model gauge group , @xmath46 we see that for a su(2 ) content presenting asymptotic freedom , i. e. @xmath47 as @xmath48 , @xmath20 increases with the energy . above the scale",
    "@xmath23 we run the renormalization group equations with particles in the full su(3)@xmath0u(1)@xmath49 representations . in the minimal models when we consider @xmath50 tev ,",
    "then perturbative expansion in @xmath9 makes sense only at energy values lower than @xmath51 tev @xcite .",
    "it jeopardizes the perturbative analysis of the neutral exotic vector boson @xmath6 which is one of the model predictions , since its mass is naively expected to have a lower limit near this perturbative upper bound .",
    "we observe that for a su(2 ) content @xmath52 presenting asymptotic freedom , i. e. with @xmath53 growing when @xmath54 , then @xmath4 decreases in the same energy interval improving the perturbative validity in such models . from eqs .",
    "( [ rccgeral ] ) and ( [ sin321 ] ) it is deduced that the condition for accomplishing this is that @xmath55 inserting the @xmath56 value at the @xmath57 pole , the condition between the coefficients turns out to be @xmath58 .",
    "so , if we want to satisfy it some additional fields in nontrivial su(2 ) representations must be considered . in order to give a bigger contribution to @xmath59 than to @xmath60",
    "their hypercharge must be small .    to be more explicit",

    "we have omitted right - handed neutrinos since , like any neutral singlet representation , they are not relevant for our purposes here . the effective su(2)@xmath0u(1)@xmath2 theory coming from this model , when the condensation @xmath76 occurs , have the same light multiplets which dominate the spectrum of the standard model plus an extra scalar isodoublet @xmath77 .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) ( where for future reference it is also shown the same running for the model with a scalar sextet ) .",
    "the scale @xmath23 is then below this value and so the energy @xmath90 at which the pole is attained is such that @xmath91 tev .",
    "the landau - like pole behavior with @xmath23 has been studied in ref .",
    "for example , if @xmath92 tev we have that at energies @xmath93 tev , @xmath94 and @xmath95 tev so that the model looses its perturbative character below the exotic neutral vector boson @xmath6 mass . in part",
    "this is due to the fact that the right handed components of the exotic quarks , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , necessary to complete the su(3)@xmath27 representations have a value of the u(1)@xmath1 charge larger than the other particles .",
    "thus , they are the major contribution to the @xmath98 running . under the assumption that they are much above the @xmath6 scale , the perturbative limit is pushed a little above . but",
    "this brings these quarks out of experimental reach .",
    "we would like to pursue the possibility of keeping them observable at tev scale . to make the exotic quarks very heavy means that the vev @xmath99 is very high and since this is also responsible for giving mass to all new fermions in the su(3)@xmath27 triplets and the new gauge bosons , it would bring almost all the predictions of the model out of experimental reach .",
    "of course , this is not interesting from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ bi1 ] ) and ( [ bi2 ] ) that multiplets having large hypercharge take us in the opposite direction of satisfying ( [ condb ] ) .",
    "isodoublets of vectorial leptons or / and scalars with zero hypercharge could then be considered . but the number of them needed would be , at least , eight of vectorial leptons or thirty two of scalars with components having electric charge @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    the simplest solution is to have exotic isotriplets . preferentially fermionics . from eqs .",
    "( [ bi1 ] ) and ( [ bi2 ] ) one can also see that the minimal number of isotriplets are three , all of vectorial leptons with @xmath102 .",
    "they are written as @xmath103 transforming as @xmath104 under the standard model group .",
    "they must be color singlets , otherwise qcd asymptotic freedom would be lost .",
    "this isotriplet couples with the usual matter .",
    "it has interesting consequences in the see - saw mechanism and it does not represent cosmological troubles if they belong to the electroweak scale , as it was studied along with other phenomenological aspects in @xcite . to be consistent with the @xmath105 decay width , their components must be heavier than @xmath106 .",
    "now the lowest dimensional su(3 ) , with u(1)@xmath49 charge zero , representations which contain an isotriplet decomposes under the standard model su(2)@xmath107u(1)@xmath2 group as @xmath108 the subscripts refer to their hypercharge value @xmath84 .",
    "the sextet gives rise to a @xmath109 isotriplet which could also do the job but it has a @xmath110 isosinglet .",
    "it could be assumed to be heavy not affecting the spectra below @xmath23 .",
    "but we want to avoid such an assumption .",
    "it would be needed also three sextets of fermions if the @xmath110 singlet components were heavy , plus a scalar one to generate masses .",
    "the octet on the other hand has the advantage of having an isosinglet and an isotriplet both neutrals in hypercharge which , therefore , do not contribute to @xmath60 .",

    "they can be made heavy if a scalar octet is present and it condensates at the @xmath23 , as we are going to discuss below .",
    "we shall then consider here the exotic vectorial leptons in three fermionic octets since they are the simplest solution . with them",
    "we also do not need to concern with anomalies .",
    "they have the form @xmath112 transforming as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "when it is introduced a representation like this , with all spinor components of the matter fields belonging to the same multiplet , differently from the usual chiral constructions , gauge invariance does allow for initial mass terms for the fields in these representations .",
    "therefore , there would be a bare mass term like @xmath115 in the lagrangian in its symmetric fase .    to satisfy the condition in eq .",
    "( [ condb ] ) the @xmath111 lepton isodoublets @xmath116 and @xmath117 in eq .",

    "then @xmath111 isodoublets in @xmath128 decouple when @xmath129 , when the following relations are satisfied @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a mass scale belonging to the standard model mass spectrum .",
    "the first relation above leaves the isotriplets @xmath132 in @xmath133 with appropriate masses below @xmath23 .",
    "the last two relations in ( [ vinc ] ) ensure that the masses of the components of the isodoublets @xmath134 and @xmath135 are heavy enough , since @xmath136 breaks the electroweak su(3)@xmath27 symmetry down to the su(2)@xmath27 group @xmath137 and the isodoublets are , in this way , decoupled of the standard model particle mass spectrum .",

    "( [ vinc ] ) .",
    "the simple analysis presented here is not complete but it is sufficient for the purposes of showing that the higher hypercharge fields can be heavy .",
    "thus , only the vector lepton isotriplets @xmath132 together with the known fields contribute to the renormalization group equations at energies @xmath140 .    in the last stage of symmetry breakdown when the standard model group reduces to the electromagnetic abelian gauge group , u(1)@xmath141 , we see from the term @xmath142 in eq .",

    "in fact , the only massive scalar state which could be free of mass contributions coming from @xmath136 would belong to the neutral scalar imaginary part , the pseudoscalar .",
    "but in the minimal model , i. e. , without regarding the octets , there is just one massive pseudoscalar and it might be heavy , since its mass is of order @xmath99 . of course , careful mass spectral analysis should be done but the arguments we just have given indicate that it really should happen . because of the reason that the major contributions to the renormalization group equations are due to the fermions , it is not expected that the perturbative limit will change significantly when the scalars are omitted below @xmath23 . but to produce any fundamental scalar would require energies @xmath201 .",
    "we have shown that the addition of octet representations can turn 3 - 3 - 1 models perturbatively viable at the upcoming tev energy scale .",
    "the main effect is that they predict a running to the electroweak angle , or better @xmath18 , such that it decreases with the increasing of the energy until the scale @xmath23 which characterizes the appearance of a su(3)@xmath0u(1)@xmath1 electroweak symmetry .",
    "it could be tested providing a direct test of exclusion for the extended models we have presented here . with the electroweak angle evolving in this way",
    "the u(1)@xmath1 coupling constant , @xmath9 , starts to run with a value which is lower than the one appearing in the minimal models . from this point @xmath18 begins to increase with energy but it will reach values near @xmath21 at energies bigger than tens of tev .    the same behavior could be accomplished with other representations different from octets .",
    "but these representations would be in general bigger than the ones we have considered here , and they would need more complicated mechanisms to decouple isomultiplets with large hypercharge . if instead we consider exotic leptons in sextets it is necessary to assume that the isosinglets with @xmath109 belonging to them are decoupled at energies @xmath202 . thus octets are simpler and more convenient .",
    "although the additional representations turn the su(3)@xmath27 gauge coupling , @xmath203 , looses its asymptotic freedom , it becomes bigger than one at energies much higher than @xmath204 .",

    "different from the exotic charged vector bosons , this neutral one does not receive contribution to its mass due to the scalar octet and it is bounded according to @xmath205^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\mu_{_{331}}. \\label{zlmass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is valid for both models here .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath206 , which is quite reasonable since as @xmath136 , @xmath207 also breaks the symmetry down to the standard model group .",
