    "at the periphery of solar active regions , rooted in strong flux concentrations , there are cool loops with temperatures of 1mk @xcite and under , with footpoints that often adopt fan - like geometries ; the so - called `` fan loops '' .",
    "high cadence euv movies of these loops reveal upward propagating motions with projected velocities of 50",
    " 150 @xmath0 @xcite that have been interpreted as flows , but also waves @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic analyses show that these loops have temperatures of 0.6  1 mk and densities comparable to those of the core loops , and emit particularly strongly in , , and lines @xcite , which have an ionization equilibrium temperature @xmath1 k. perhaps in contradiction to the upward propagating disturbances , the emission of these lines is consistently red - shifted @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the downflowing plasma that has been observed off - limb in high cadence monochromatic imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fans can live for hours and days @xcite , but the individual structures evolve on timescales of the order of tens of minutes .    also at the periphery , there are low density areas at 1  2 mk , that are hardly noticeable in emission when compared to the core loops .",
    "in fact , only recent spectral measurements from the extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board _ hinode _ have revealed that these areas are very distinct in doppler maps for their characteristic strong blue - shifts and enhanced broadening of  lines @xcite .",
    "the shifts in the spectral line profiles are up to 50 @xmath0 , but asymmetries in the blue wings expose contributions from plasma at 100  200 @xmath0 @xcite , indicative of outflows that often persist for many days .",
    "these regions lie over or near magnetic flux concentrations of a single polarity @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that these persistent blue - shifts in the outskirts of active regions are the spectral signature of the disturbances observed by euv imagers in the 1 mk loops and suggest that the upflows are related to spicule activity .    in this paper , we find short timescale variability in the blue wing enhancements in the 195.119   line , supportive of the transient nature of the disturbances precursors .",
    "we do not , however , find any obvious relationship between the temporal response of the low density plasma at 1 mk and the evolution of the high density 0.6 mk loops . we do observe disturbances propagating out in the 195.119 monochromatic imaging , which is qualitatively consistent with the blue - shifts , but no outward disturbances are detected in the 275.368   line .",
    "time sequences in this line show downward propagating trends that are consistent with the red - shifted emission of the line .",
    "we present results from two active region data sets obtained with the extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer @xcite on board _ hinode _ @xcite .",
    "the eis instrument is a high spatial ( 1  or 2  per pixel ) and spectral ( 22 m ) resolution imaging spectrograph .",
    "it observes coronal and transition region spectral lines in two wavelength ranges : 170  210   and 245  290  .",
    "users can opt between narrow slit spectroscopy ( 1  and 2  slits ) or wide slit imaging ( 40  and 266  slits ) .",
    "eis observed active region ( ar ) 11048 on 2010 february 17 . the observing sequence ( 10:45  15:27 ut ) consisted of @xmath2 images made out of fifteen consecutive 10s exposures at adjacent solar positions , resulting in a 3 minute cadence .",
    "despite the fact that the full spectral range is exposed on the detector , only a limited number of spectral windows is retrieved .",
    "we will discuss here in more detail images from two spectral lines : 275.368   and   195.119  .",
    "the spectral purity of these images is 0.9  .",
    "the imaging sequence was preceded and followed by two narrow slit ( 1 ) @xmath3 rasters .",
    "the rasters are sparsely sampled : the slit takes 3  steps between every exposure ( 50 s ) , which allows a faster scanning of the target .",
    "the rasters serve as a spectral diagnostics reference , in particular for the line - of - sight velocity .",
    "top panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : context_images ] show slot images of the active region for the two lines of interest , plus 262.98  .",
    "the dotted line encloses the field - of - view of the rasters .",
    "they are located over the low density regions at the periphery of the active region .",
    "notice that in that region shows also bright high density loops .",
    "some of the spectral properties of this ar were also discussed by @xcite .    on 2010",
    "march 8 eis observed the decaying ar 11045 .",
    "the observing sequence starts with a context @xmath4 fully sampled raster ( 1  slit , 60 s exposures ) , followed by the 3 minute cadence slot imaging ( 17:23  20:55 ut ) . to investigate the short term variability of the spectral signatures ,",
    "the sequence is followed by a set of sparsely sampled rasters ( 2  slit , 4  steps ) that cover a @xmath5 area in 6 minutes from 21:41 ut until 00:03 ut .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : context_images ] show a view of the active region and the different fields - of - view .",
    "the electronic version of the manuscript contains movies of both datasets .",
    "data were processed using standard eis software .",
    "this involves subtraction of the dark current and correction of artifacts like cosmic rays and warm and hot pixels .",
    "images were co - aligned using standard cross - correlation techniques .",
    "this removes both the spacecraft jitter and the displacement of the slot images along the wavelength direction on the detector due to the orbital changes in temperature @xcite .",
    "investigations of apparent motions in active region peripheral loops have been presented before .",
    "the novelty of this work is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we provide the first look at the motions with relatively high cadence ( 3 minute ) monochromatic ( 0.9  ) imaging , which should clarify any ambiguities from line blending that is present in euv imagers . secondly , we present the first analysis of the short timescale spectral variability of the blue - shifted low density regions . prior to these results",
    "we will discuss the morphological relationship between the bright red - shifted loops and the dim blue - shifted loops .",
    "[ fig : rasters ] shows the rastered areas of both active regions outlined with dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : context_images ] .",
    "the first column is the radiance , followed by doppler velocities and line widths .",
    "these quantities correspond to the gaussian fit of the spectral profiles , a two gaussian fit in the case of the 195.119   to account for the blend with the 195.179   line @xcite .",
    "contours of the emission have been put on top of the maps for reference .",
    "note that the intensity scaling is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : context_images ] .",
    "there are several difficulties with measuring doppler velocities with eis and @xcite describe them in some detail .",
    "first , we need to correct for the orbital drift of the spectrum on the detector and then we have to assume a reference wavelength as our zero velocity .",
    "we use 195.119   and 275.368   , as suggested by @xcite    the blue - shifts and width enhancements are located in regions that are dim compared to the core of the active region .",
    "this is now well known from eis spectra @xcite .",
    "the line is weak outside the clearly defined loops , so the doppler velocities and widths are only shown for the areas with high signal - to - noise ( @xmath6 ) . as discussed by @xcite these cool loops are consistently red - shifted .",
    "width enhancements can also be detected in the march 8 dataset .",
    "they mostly correspond to the dim areas in between the bright loop footpoints .                        in general , fig .",
    "[ fig : rasters ] suggests that the bright loops are co - spatial with the blue - shifts .",
    "there are differences , however , when we look at the details .",
    "extended loop structures in have a correspondence in in the february 17 dataset , but not as much on march 8 .",
    "some of the outward propagating motions , that will be discussed in the next section , occur in areas where no sizable emission can be seen , for instance the south west corner of the february 17 dataset",
    ". an explanation could be that at this location only the footpoints of the loops hosting the disturbances have a cooler signature .",
    "that is what movie 1 , available in the electronic version , shows .",
    "the march 8 dataset , however , shows significant areas of the field - of - view that have dim emission and strong blue - shifts with no noticeable signatures in the cooler line , e.g. , around [ 385,490 ] .",
    "movie 2 confirms this and rules out the possibility of a time dependent origin for the discrepancy .",
    "what we can not completely rule out is that the absence of a cooler plasma counterpart in these areas is just due to the instrument s sensitivity .",
    "movie 1 and movie 2 , available in the electronic version of the manuscript , show the variability of the two active regions peripheral loops for the two spectral lines , 275.368   and 195.119  , side by side .",
    "the february 17 dataset shows disturbances propagating radially out from the blue - shifted area presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rasters ] .",
    "this also occurs in the march 8 observations .",
    "these apparent motions are comparable to the ones observed with _ trace _ and xrt/_hinode _ @xcite .",
    "our observations therefore confirm that the phenomenon is observable at 1mk : the eis wide slit images isolate a very narrow ( 0.9  ) and blend free spectral region around the line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ trace _ 171   and 195   passbands can be ambiguous in this respect because both bands have significant contributions from plasma at 0.6 mk , namely and lines @xcite , precisely the lines in which the cool peripheral loops manifest themselves .",
    "an analogous argument can be made about the broad temperature response of xrt filters .",
    "these outward propagating disturbances are not observed in the images .",
    "[ fig : rdiff1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rdiff2 ] show examples of time distance plots for various representative locations in both active regions .",
    "each figure compares the time dependent intensity fluctuations of and along four loop segments .",
    "the time - distance plots were constructed in the following manner .",
    "following @xcite we first manually selected the points along the segment .",
    "the points were used as spline knots to define a loop coordinate system ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) where @xmath7 goes along the loop s axis and @xmath8 perpendicular to it . from this",
    "interpolated straightened loop segment we extracted the intensity along the axis ( 1  across ) and plotted it as function of time .",
    "this is shown in logarithmic scale in the middle panel . to its right",
    "we also show the running difference , i.e. the difference between two consecutive intensity values at a particular location . the running difference time - distance plots have been smoothed ( boxcar of three pixels ) to increase the signal - to - noise .    the loops are shown as a solid red line .",
    "the top two loops were selected based on the propagating lanes followed by the disturbances .",
    "the bottom two outline clearly defined loops in the images .",
    "the time - distance plots in show features very similar to ones seen by _ trace _ and xrt : recurrent inclined ridges that represent intensity fluctuations propagating along the loops as function of time .",
    "the velocity of propagation ranges between 40 ",
    "130@xmath9 , as the reference solid blue lines show .",
    "these are propagation velocities on the plane - of - the - sky and therefore only lower limits .",
    "therefore , for , we find qualitative consistency between the spectral blue - shifts and the upward apparent motions in the imaging .",
    "the time - distance plots of the top two loops do not exhibit any distinct variability .",
    "in particular , most of the emission of this line at the south west corner of the image s field - of - view is noise .",
    "the bottom loops do experience some variability .",
    "we observe downward propagating intensity changes at lower speeds 15  20@xmath9 , qualitatively consistent with the spectral redshifts measured in the rasters . similar downflows in loops have also been observed off - limb @xcite .",
    "if this is a manifestation of cooling loops , we do not see any evidence of them in the hotter line .",
    "the picture , however , can be more complicated than just downflows , as the last panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdiff1 ] shows , where the ridges show oppositely directed trends .",
    "@xcite already pointed out the rather complex evolution of these fan loops comparing them to `` rippling curtains '' .",
    "ultimately , what seems clear from the comparison of the time - distance plots is that there is no evidence that the structures and the intensity fluctuations they exhibit in ( 1.3 mk ) and ( 0.6 mk ) are related to one another .",
    "as stated before , sensitivity can be an issue in the case of the cooler and weaker line , however , it does not explain why we do not see the downward trends in .",
    "the time - distance plots of the march 8 dataset may appear less compelling due to the data gaps .",
    "movies 1 and movie 2 show , however , that both examples portray the same phenomenom .",
    "this is important , because the march 8 dataset allows us to look into the time - dependent spectroscopic properties .",
    "we have confirmed that there are outward propagating disturbances at 1 mk that originate in blue shifted areas at the periphery of active regions .",
    "the time - distance plots clearly show that the perturbations are discrete in nature , but spectroscopically we only know that they can persist for days @xcite .",
    "we investigate therefore the variability of the doppler shifts in short timescales to determine whether that transient nature is also reflected in the line profiles .",
    "[ fig : scan_steps ] shows a sequence of radiances and doppler shifts for the two spectral lines in the march 8 dataset .",
    "the field - of - view corresponds to the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : context_images ] .",
    "the rasters , consisting of fifteen 20 s exposures with 4  steps in between , result in a 5 minute cadence .",
    "we only show a third of that cadence in the figure .",
    "it confirms that and are consistently blue and red shifted .",
    "[ fig : spec_profiles ] shows in its left panel the doppler shift and width variations of the line at one particular location . while the changes observed in the main component of the line are small , within the standard deviation ( dashed lines ) , we do detect asymmetric wing enhancements in the blue side of the line profiles , on timescales as short as the 5 minute cadence ( see right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_profiles ] ) .",
    "the enhancements occur at velocities of @xmath10 .",
    "this result confirms the suspicion that the reported asymmetric profiles discussed by @xcite and @xcite can have a short term nature , which favors an association with the discrete outward propagating intensity disturbances .",
    "the spectral line , however , is dominated by emission that exhibits a rather constant line - of - sight velocity of @xmath11 .",
    "we have investigated the time dependent spectral properties of areas at the periphery of active region cores . in 195.119    ( 1.3 mk )",
    "we find recurrent intensity disturbances originating in low density regions that propagate outwards along loop structures at projected velocities of 40  130 @xmath9 .",
    "this is consistent with the characteristic blue - shifted emission measured along the line - of - sight at their footpoints .",
    "the spectral profiles are dominated by small and constant shifts ( @xmath12 ) in the main component of the spectral line , but reveal transient intensity enhancements in the blue wing at velocities of @xmath13 , on timescales as short as the available cadence : 5 minutes .",
    "this is supportive of the interpretations of the fluctuations as a result of transient events @xcite , although we have not been able to establish a connection with the cooler temperatures .    in 275.368   ( 0.6 mk )",
    "the same areas alternate apparent voids with high density bright loops characterized by emission which is consistently red - shifted .",
    "no sign of the recurrent outward propagating disturbances is detected , but when trends are present they are generally downward at velocities of @xmath14 , qualitatively consistent with the spectral measurements at the footpoints .",
    "we find therefore no evidence that the structures and the intensity fluctuations visible at 1 mk and 0.6 mk are inter - related .",
    "given that _ trace _ 195   images can be contaminated by the emission of 0.6 mk cool lines @xcite , this is the first confirmation that the outward propagating disturbances take place at 1 mk temperatures .",
    "outward propagating perturbations have also been observed by _ trace _ in its 171   filter images , which are mostly dominated by emission from -x lines .",
    "we do not observe those perturbations in the fan loops , which suggests either that the eis instrument is not sensitive enough to detect them or that the perturbations observed on the 171   fan loops are coronal in nature and a result of the broader temperature response .",
    "new coordinated observations of eis and aia/_sdo _ , with similar filters , should shed some light on this issue .",
