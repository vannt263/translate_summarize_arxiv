    "understanding accretion onto black holes remains one of the most active areas of research in astrophysics today , both for probing black hole properties and because of their impact on larger - scale problems in galaxy and structure formation .",
    "in many nearby galaxies , the model of a central black hole gravitationally capturing ambient gas ( bondi accretion ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a vital part of our understanding of how black holes are accreting .",
    "the key to understanding the dynamics of gas in the systems of interest lies in correctly modeling the behavior of the accreting gas once it falls within the gravitational influence of the black hole , the bondi radius @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath7 is the sound speed of the gas in the vicinity of @xmath8 . in the absence of angular momentum ,",
    "the black hole is predicted to gravitationally capture the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounding it at the bondi rate @xmath9 , where @xmath10 for an adiabatic process and @xmath11 is the density of the gas at @xmath8 . for observed central @xmath11 values of many nearby elliptical galaxies or sgr a@xmath12 , observed",
    "luminosities are orders of magnitude smaller than what would be predicted based on the bondi accretion rate and assuming a standard 10% radiative efficiency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these observational results imply that the radiative efficiency of the infalling gas is exceedingly low and/or that much less material is accreted by the black hole than the bondi formula implies .",
    "the very weak radiation from most nearby massive black holes has prompted a significant theoretical effort aimed at explaining the very low radiative efficiencies and/or accretion rates .",
    "the central idea is that accretion proceeds via a hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) rather than a canonical thin accretion disk .",
    "early riaf models include the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the advection - dominated inflow - outflow solution ( adios ; * ? ? ?",
    "determining which ( if any ) of these scenarios describes low-@xmath13 black hole systems is of fundamental importance to our understanding of accretion physics and black hole demography .",
    "observational work has focused on using spatially unresolved spectral information to constrain theoretical models . while such studies have been successful in ruling out classical adaf models in some instances ( e.g. , sgr a@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the main limitation has been the inability of even _",
    "chandra _ to resolve the accretion flow inside @xmath8 and directly determine the density profiles of the accretion flow , as it is the shape of the density profile that most strongly distinguishes the theoretical models . while adafs , cdafs , and adios models all predict that the compression of gas within the accretion flow within the bondi radius leads to a @xmath14 relation for the gas , the models predicted significantly different radial density profiles ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .    in this letter , we present for the first time spatially resolved temperature and density profiles within the bondi radius of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "dynamical modeling of the stellar kinematics of the bulge of ngc 3115 has confirmed that it harbors a 12 @xmath15 black hole @xcite . at a distance of 9.7 mpc @xcite ,",
    "this makes ngc 3115 the nearest @xmath16 black hole . despite its large mass ,",
    "the black hole is very radio quiet , with a core 5 ghz luminosity of less than @xmath17 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 @xcite , several orders of magnitude lower than other black holes of similar mass .",
    "the black hole is also undetected in x - rays , with a _",

    "the estimated bondi accretion rate based on the previous observed density of @xmath19 @xmath20 @xcite in the central part of the galaxy is @xmath21 , implying an expected luminosity @xmath22 erg s@xmath3 if accretion occurred with @xmath23 efficiency .",
    "the lack of radio power argues that it is unlikely that jets are interacting strongly with the gas inside @xmath8 .",
    "ngc 3115 ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) was observed with _ chandra _ on 2001 june 14 , 2010 january 27 , and 2010 january 29 for 37 , 41 , and 77  ks , respectively .",
    "all the data were reprocessed using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software version 4.3 and the _ chandra _ calibration database ( caldb ) version 4.4.1 .",
    "we used a local background that is extracted from the 7090   annulus centered at the x - ray peak .",
    "the background region is far enough from the center so that the source removed surface brightness of the x - ray emission is basically flat beyond 70 .",
    "the background only contributes less than about 1% of the emission ( 0.56.0  kev ) within the bondi radius ( @xmath24 ) and less than about 7% for the ambient region beyond the bondi flow ( 410 ) .",
    "errors are given at @xmath25 level unless otherwise specified .",
    "@xcite optical contour .",
    "the inset is the 2.06.0 kev image of the central 25@xmath26 region .",
    "there is not a point source at the center , but a plateau in the diffuse x - ray surface brightness . ]",
    "we extracted spectra in annuli centered at the central peak of the extended x - ray emission .",
    "this peak was detected as a source by ciao _",
    "wavdetect_. however , further analysis shows that a modeled circular gaussian width of this peak emission is twice extended as that of a nearby bright point source and that the central source is static ( varied less than 2@xmath27 ) within and between the observations .",
    "thus , it is dominated by a concentration of hot gas and unresolved binaries rather than a single compact accreting object .",
    "we included this peak emission but excluded all the other sources detected by _ wavdetect _ during the analysis .",
    "the unresolved x - ray emission is mainly contributed by unresolved low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries ( cv / abs ) , and the diffuse hot gas component that we are interested in .",
    "the very soft emission from the gas and the very hard emission from the unresolved lmxbs are easy to separate spectrally .",
    "no appreciable emission is expected from the gas above 2 kev , so we can use the 26 kev emission as a lever arm for estimating the amount of unresolved lmxb flux in the 0.52.0 kev band and subtract it accordingly if we assume an appropriate spectral model for the lmxbs . @xcite",
    "have shown that the summed spectra of resolved low-@xmath13 ( @xmath28 erg s@xmath3 ) lmxbs in the bulge of m31 are very similar to more luminous lmxbs .",
    "hence , it is valid to assume that the unresolved lmxb emission can be spectrally modeled as the brighter resolved sources .",
    "we found that the fainter , softer source like those that make up the galactic ridge emission ( cv / ab ) contributes similarly to the soft flux of the gas based on @xmath13@xmath29 scaling relations within @xmath30 for this component , where @xmath29 is the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xmath31-band luminosity .",
    "hence , including this component is essential in the analysis .",
    "for the lmxb component , we take @xmath32 measured from the combined spectrum of all the resolved point sources within @xmath33 of ngc 3115 . for the cv / ab component , we fitted the unresolved x - ray emission of m32 , which is believed to be truly gas free @xcite , using an absorbed thermal + power - law model .",
    "the best - fit temperature is @xmath34 kev and the power - law index is @xmath35 , which are consistent with the values measured by @xcite .",
    "the cv / ab normalizations of each annulus are determined by the @xmath13@xmath29 scaling relation derived from m32 .",
    "we used the x - ray spectral fitting package ( xspec ) for spectral analysis .",
    "the 2001 and 2010 spectra of each annulus in the 0.56.0  kev energy range were fitted jointly to the three - component absorbed model ( phabs in xspec)a thermal model ( apec in xspec ) for the gas , a power - law ( powerlaw in xspec ) for the unresolved lmxbs , and a combination of thermal + power law ( apec + powerlaw ) model for the cv / abs .",
    "the absorption is fixed at the galactic value of @xmath36  @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we fit the temperature of the thermal gas component .",
    "the normalizations of the thermal gas and the lmxb components are allowed to vary and untied .",
    "since the abundance can not be constrained from the spectra , we fixed it to solar value . using 0.2",
    "solar only increases the best - fit temperature by @xmath38 and increases the gas normalizations by a factor of four .",
    "the derived density only increases by a factor of two and all our conclusions remain the same .",
    "all the other parameters are fixed as described above .",
    "the spectra were fitted using the @xmath39-statistic .",
    "varying @xmath40 or @xmath41 by their @xmath25 uncertainties or varying the cv / ab normalizations by @xmath42 ( that is larger than their @xmath25 uncertainties ) only changes the best - fit gas temperature or the gas normalizations by @xmath439% .",
    "the projected temperature profile is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : t_n_profile ] .",
    "although the error bars are quite large , it can be seen that the trend is rising toward the center as expected in a bondi flow . we have also constructed a physical model with a temperature profile expected in a bondi flow ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) and a density profile taken from our best - fit model ( @xmath45 ; see section  [ sec : sb ] below ) .",
    "the simulated projected temperature profile is consistent with our measured profile . in particular ,",
    "the simulated projected temperature within the 2   region is biased low with respect to the deprojected ( physical ) temperature and is consistent with our measured low value .",
    "thus , the bias in the central temperature may be explained by the projection of the cooler gas from the outer region .",
    "is shown in solid line . ]    for a measured ism temperature of 0.3 kev in the outer most bin , this corresponds to @xmath8=112224 pc ( 24@xmath46 ) depending on the adopted black hole mass estimate ( 1@xmath47 ) .",
    "careful selection of the boundary radius suggests that the onset in the increase in temperature begins at @xmath30@xmath48 , rather than at @xmath49 . to confirm this ,",
    "we have performed a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulation to address the significance of the rise in temperature just within a radius of @xmath30 . the distribution ( normalized probability ) and the cumulative probability of the simulated temperature ratios between the @xmath49@xmath30 and the @xmath30@xmath50 annuli are plotted in figure  [ fig : mcmc ] .",
    "the mcmc test suggests that the temperature ratio is larger than 1.13 at the 90% confidence level . assuming that the temperature beyond @xmath8 is constant and @xmath51 inside @xmath8@xmath52 @xcite . ] , the expected temperature ratio at 3  and at @xmath8 ( 4 ) is 1.33 , which is consistent with the peak ratio of 1.4 in the mcmc simulation .",
    "@xmath30 ( @xmath53 ) and the @xmath30@xmath50 ( @xmath54 ) annuli .",
    "the vertical line cuts the cumulative probability at 10% . ]",
    "the harder spectrum within @xmath30 is not the spurious result of any hard central point source .",
    "we obtained the same overall result even when we excised the inner @xmath55 .",
    "the effect of unresolved x - ray binaries has been properly accounted for by quantifying the unresolved emission in the 2.06.0 kev band and extrapolating to lower energies .",
    "the effect of a large number of softer accreting white dwarfs , stellar coronae , etc .",
    ", has also been taken into account in our analysis .",
    "such an increase in the temperature is exactly what is expected in all models in which the black hole is gravitationally capturing the ambient gas ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , a similar spike in ism temperature was found at the center of ngc 4649 and was interpreted as confirmation of a @xmath56@xmath57 black hole @xcite , although in this galaxy @xmath8 is unresolved by _",
    "chandra_. finally , the lack of detectable radio emission from the core of ngc 3115 argues against heating of the gas from jets .",
    "we have calculated the surface brightness profiles for the thermal gas , cv / ab , and lmxb components .",
    "the cv / ab profile was calculated using the same @xmath13@xmath29 scaling relations mentioned above .",
    "the lmxb profile was calculated by assuming that the emission above 2  kev is contributed by the lmxbs only , and its contribution to the soft emission was calculated by the assumed spectral model above . the gas profile in the soft band",
    "was calculated by subtracting the cv / ab and lmxb contributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : sb ] shows the surface brightness profiles for the three components in the 0.51.0  kev energy band .",
    "the upper limit is chosen to maximize the contribution from the gas component with respect to the other two components .",
    "note that the gas component is clearly detected within @xmath58 and is rising more steeply compared to the stellar ( cv / ab ) component toward the center .        with the surface brightness profile for the hot gas component",
    ", the electron density profile can be deprojected .",
    "we converted the count rate in each annulus into flux using the xspec apec model with a temperature of 0.45  kev and solar abundance .",
    "the temperature was taken as the mid value of the best - fit temperature of the central 02  bin and the ambient temperature .",
    "since the emissivity mainly depends on density , the precise value of temperature is not important at our level of accuracy .",
    "we have tested the density profiles derived using different temperatures between 0.30.6  kev .",
    "all the derived density profiles are consistent within the error bars .",
    "the flux was then deprojected into emissivity , @xmath59 , at each radius using a method described in @xcite and also described in @xcite .",
    "this technique calculates the emission measures of each spherical shell starting from the outer most annulus toward the center , and the emission measure of each subsequent shell is calculated by subtracting the projected emission from the outer shells . the electron density",
    "can then be converted from the emissivity by the relation @xmath60 , where the emissivity function @xmath61 depends on the temperature and the abundance .",
    "the emissivity function is taken from the same apec model .",
    "the deprojected electron density profile is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : t_n_profile ] .",
    "the errors were estimated by running @xmath62 monte carlo simulations .",
    "fitting the density profile within @xmath30 to a power law gives @xmath63}$ ] .",
    "this is consistent with the power law index of @xmath64 in the @xmath30@xmath65 region .",
    "accretion models predict that gas within the bondi radius flows toward the smbh .",
    "the increases in the temperature and density of thermal gas toward the center are direct evidence that the gas is being gravitationally captured by the smbh .",
    "resolving the temperature and density profiles within the bondi radius can provide tight constraints to accretion models .",
    "our 150 ks _",
    "chandra _ observation of ngc 3115 supports that there is a rise in temperature inside @xmath8 compared to the galaxy s ism temperature outside @xmath8 , exactly as expected from accretion models .",
    "we have shown that the onset in the increase in temperature begins at @xmath66@xmath48 rather than at 2 .",
    "this supports that the mass of the smbh is at the upper end of the @xmath67@xmath0 range @xcite .    in previous studies where the bondi accretion flow could not be spatially resolved",
    ", the overall spectrum has to be modeled to constrain accretion model . with the spatially resolved spectra we have measured",
    ", we can draw definite conclusion for the first time on the dynamical properties within the bondi radius . in these regions ( @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the schwarzschild radius ) ,",
    "the electron temperature is fairly well determined since the gas is essentially virial and one temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , observations of the bremsstrahlung emission in x - ray give direct information on the density of the outer regions of the bondi flow and thereby the accretion rate on the outside ( @xmath70 ) .    because the uncertainties in our measurements are still large , we do not attempt to compare the observational results to state - of - art theoretical models . instead , we focus on the simplest classical models . in the early analytic models ( adafs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it was argued that the radiative efficiency is low because the accretion flow is a hot two - temperature plasma in which most of the energy is carried into the black hole by the ions .",
    "if the electrons  which produce the radiation we observe  receive very little of the energy in the system , the radiative efficiency will be much lower than the standard value of @xmath7110% . in adaf models ,",
    "the accretion rate is argued to be similar to the bondi rate and the dynamics of the inflowing gas is similar to that of spherical bondi accretion , even though the inflow has angular momentum .",
    "contrary to adaf and bondi predictions , more recent analytic models suggest that when the radiative efficiency is low , very little of the mass available at large radii actually accretes onto the black hole , with most of it being blown away at all radii in an outflow ( adios ; * ? ? ? * ) or continuously circulating in convective eddies ( cdaf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accretion rates @xmath72 are strongly supported by global numerical simulations of thick disk accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    ", we assume the self - similar structure of the accretion models extends from the vicinity of the smbh out to the bondi radius ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the classic bondi / adaf models , @xmath73 , while in cdafs the redistribution of gas via convection predicts a much flatter density profile , @xmath74 .",
    "the adios models allow the accretion rate to vary with radius and the density profile is modified as @xmath75 , where @xmath76@xmath67 characterize the density and accretion rate suppression . in our 150 ks observation , we have constrained @xmath77 from the density profile , which is consistent with the value of @xmath78 measured from the spatially unresolved spectrum of sgr a@xmath12 by @xcite , although they can not put constraints from their data .",
    "taken at face value , we have barely ruled out the classical bondi / adaf model and the classical cdaf model at about @xmath79 , provided that the density profile has a single power - law index within @xmath8 .",
    "however , theoretical models also suggest that the regions we have resolved are still in transition from the ambient ism to the accretion flow @xcite and the slope in these regions can be different from the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the measured density slope within @xmath8 is consistent with that beyond .",
    "thus , the adaf / cdaf models might not be ruled out .",
    "more theoretical work is needed to interpret the data .",
    "nevertheless , the data suggest that the transition does not finish until at least @xmath80 for either the classical bondi / adaf or the cdaf models . the density profile around @xmath81@xmath82",
    "does provide some direct constraints to theoretical models , e.g. , thermal conduction can change the power - law index of the density by about 0.5 around those regions @xcite .",
    "we determined that the bondi accretion rate of ngc 3115 is @xmath83  yr@xmath3 . assuming a 10% radiative efficiency , the accretion luminosity at @xmath8 ( @xmath4  erg  s@xmath3 ) is about six orders of magnitude higher than the upper limit of the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus .",
    "such a discrepancy can be explained if the accretion rate is lower than the classical bondi rate .",
    "for example , the accretion rate for the adios or cdaf models is suppressed and scales with radius as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter in the standard thin disk model @xcite . using a typical value of @xmath86 to calculate @xmath87 at @xmath88 , @xmath89 should be close to 1 to explain the discrepancy .",
    "it is also quite possible that the gas has non - negligible angular momentum that should be more important at smaller radii .",
    "this can reduce the accretion rate near the event horizon ( e.g. , proga & begelman 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , the radiation efficiency can be lower than the canonical value of 0.1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?"
