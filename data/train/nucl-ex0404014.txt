    "event anisotropy analysis is a powerful tool for studying properties of the early stage in high - energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "recent results of event anisotropy analysis suggest that finite @xmath2 ( second harmonic coefficient of fourier expansion of azimuthal distributions ) is present up to relatively high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 gev/@xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "measurement of @xmath5 s can reach very high @xmath6 and thus should permit study of the effect of hard processes , e.g. jet quenching , on @xmath0 .",
    "the dominant source of photons seen in the experiment is from meson decays ( mainly from @xmath5 s ) , and there have been several measurements on @xmath0 of charged hadron and identified @xmath5 up to high @xmath6 close to 10 gev/@xmath4 . as a next step in the systematic study of @xmath0 at high @xmath6",
    ", we have investigated subtracting the hadronic decay contribution from the @xmath0 of the measured photons to determine the feasibility of seeing the direct or thermal photon @xmath0 .",
    "we have also investigated the measured electron spectrum , which includes contributions from hadron decays and conversion photons ( referred to as  _ photonic electrons _ \" ) .",
    "these effects are well studied  @xcite and we extract the charmed electron distribution after subtractions .",
    "we adopt the same method in electron @xmath0 analysis to obtain the charmed electron @xmath0 .",
    "event anisotropy analysis is an application of the fourier expansion of azimuthal particle distributions . here",
    "we focus on the elliptic component of the event anisotropy . due to momentum conservation and rotational symmetry",
    ", the odd order harmonics will be canceled when we add positive and negative rapidity regions . additionally assuming that the contribution of higher order of harmonics is negligible , the distributions are described by @xmath7                                    \\bigr )                                    \\nonumber                              =     c                                    \\bigl (                                      1 + 2 v_{2}^{m } \\cos[2(\\phi-\\phi_{r } ) ]                                    \\bigr ) ,     \\label{eq_fourier}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the rapidity and @xmath9 is the azimuthal angle of the particle , @xmath10 is the reaction plane , @xmath11 is the 2nd order of the fourier coefficient measured by detectors , and @xmath12 is a constant .",
    "the reaction plane is defined using beam - beam counters  @xcite ( @xmath13=3.1@xmath144.0 ) with a resolution due to signal size of @xmath0 and multiplicity on the detector .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 is broadened by the uncertainty of the reaction plane definition .",
    "the method of @xmath11 correction we adopted , described in reference  @xcite , results in a real @xmath2 corrected by the reaction plane resolution @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the resolution for the 2nd harmonic . since the reaction plane is distributed uniformly , the efficiency of the detector is canceled .",
    "hence , we fit the number of particles as a function of @xmath17 by equation  ( [ eq_fourier ] ) to obtain @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath5 @xmath2 analysis is performed in the following steps : 1 ) counting the number of @xmath5 s from invariant mass from two photons measured by the emcal  @xcite as a function of @xmath17 for each centrality and @xmath19 bin , 2 ) fitting the distribution by equation  ( [ eq_fourier ] ) , and 3 ) reaction plane resolution correction to @xmath11 .",

    "the additional contributions to the systematic error are the following : ( 1 ) particle identification cut , ( 2 ) reaction plane determination , and ( 3 ) error propagation in ",
    "_ photonic electron _ \" subtraction ( only for charmed electron @xmath0 ) .",
    "the total systematic error is estimated by adding the contributions quadratically .",

    "the upper limit of the @xmath19 range is defined by the available statistics while the lower limit of @xmath19@xmath211 gev/@xmath4 results from hadron contamination in the emcal .",

    ", the meson @xmath0 remains different from that for baryons .",
    "this suggests a scaling rule called quark coalescence  @xcite , related to the different number of quarks in mesons and baryons , which might indicate that the hadron @xmath0 is generated during the early partonic stage before the hadronization . a simple check of a coalescence picture in @xmath0 is normalization of both @xmath0 and @xmath6 by the number of constituent quarks .",

    "one scenario is that @xmath31 mesons are made from completely thermalized charm and light quarks ( shown by solid line ) , while the other is that there is no interaction of the @xmath4-quarks , so that the flow contribution in @xmath31 s is only from the light quarks ( dashed line ) . the non - photonic electrons decay from charmed and bottomed mesons ; those in the @xmath6 range we showed are dominantly charmed meson decay .",
