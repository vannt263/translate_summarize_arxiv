    "this quantization scheme constructs the quantum pd in two steps :    \\1 ) the players payoff relations are re - expressed in terms of joint probabilities corresponding to generalized epr - bohm experiments involving a bipartite system shared between two players . in a run each player receives one part of the system",
    "while having two observables both of which are dichotomic .",
    "a player s strategy is defined to be entirely classical that consists of a linear combination ( with real and normalized coefficients ) of choosing between his / her two observables .",
    "the scheme embeds the classical game within the quantum game by placing constraints on joint probabilities .",
    "these constraints guarantee that for factorizable joint probabilities the classical game emerges along with its particular outcome .",
    "\\2 ) as a set of joint probabilities that violates bell s inequality must always be non - factorizable , the corresponding quantum game is constructed by retaining the constraints on joint probabilities , obtained in the last step , while they can now be non - factorizable .    by constructing quantum games from non - factorizable joint probabilities , which a quantum mechanical apparatus can provide , this quantization scheme avoids state vectors and brings out the essence of quantum games without referring to quantum mechanics  an important consideration in developing the present approach to quantum games .",
    "game theory finds applications in a range of disciplines  @xcite and we believe that more accessible approaches to quantum games remain in need of development .",
    "it turns out that in this quantization scheme the constraints on joint probabilities obtained for the game of pd , which embed the classical game within the quantum game , come out to be so strong that the subsequent permitting joint probabilities to become non - factorizable can not change the outcome of the game .",
    "the quantum pd game that is played in this framework , therefore , generates an outcome identical to the one obtained in the classical game in which both players defect .",
    "this finding motivates us in the present paper to investigate if non - factorizable joint probabilities can bring out some non - classical outcome for a refinement of the ne in the pd game , while not affecting the ne itself .    in this paper",
    "we show that surprisingly this indeed is the case .",
    "that is , with an epr - bohm type setting for playing a quantum game a set of non - factorizable joint probabilities is able to produce a non - classical outcome in the quantum pd game to a well known refinement on the set of symmetric nash equilibria  called an evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess )  @xcite .",
    "this contrasts interestingly with the reported result  @xcite that for the same game , non - factorizable joint probabilities are unable to produce a non - classical outcome for a ne and the classical ne remains intact as the unique solution of the quantum pd game .    using the quantization schemes of eisert et al .",
    "@xcite  and marinatto and weber  @xcite , the game - theoretic concept of an ess was originally investigated in the area of quantum games by iqbal and toor in a series of papers  @xcite and was reviewed by iqbal and cheon in a book chapter  iqbalcheonchapter .",
    "the present paper addresses the issues raised in these publications using the new approach towards constructing quantum games recently proposed by iqbal and cheon  @xcite ,  which exploits non - factorizable property of quantum mechanical joint probabilities in the construction of quantum games .    in a recent paper  @xcite we have investigated a quantum version of the matching pennies game played in this quantization scheme to find that non - classical ne emerge in this game for sets of ( quantum mechanical ) joint probabilities that maximally violate chsh form of bell s inequality  peres .",
    "the present paper considers the pd game in this quantization scheme and explores the fate of a well known refinement of the ne concept in relation to joint probabilities becoming non - factorizable .",
    "an ess is the central solution concept of evolutionary game theory  weibull , samuelson ( egt ) . in egt genes",
    "are considered players in survival games and players strategies are the behavioral characteristics imparted by genes to their host organism , while the payoff to a gene is the number of offspring carrying that gene  @xcite .",
    "the players strategies ( which the players genes play until the biological agents carrying those genes die ) and their payoffs become related as host organisms having favourable behavioral characteristics are better able to reproduce than others .    referring to a pool of genes , the notion of an ess considers a large population of players ( genes ) in which players are matched in random pair - wise contests .",
    "we call the two players in an interaction to be player @xmath0 and player @xmath1",
    ". each player can play the strategy @xmath2 or the strategy @xmath3 in a pair - wise interaction and the payoff matrix for the game is given as    @xmath4    where the two entries in the bracket are player @xmath5 s and player @xmath1 s strategies , respectively .",
    "for example , player @xmath5 s payoff is @xmath6 when both players play the strategy @xmath2 .",
    "it is found useful to define    @xmath7    to be player @xmath5 s and player @xmath1 s payoff matrices , respectively .",
    "we write players payoffs as @xmath8 where subscripts @xmath5 or @xmath1 refer to the players and @xmath9 and @xmath10 in bracket are player @xmath5 s and player @xmath1 s strategies , respectively",
    ".    an ess deals with symmetric games in which    @xmath11    saying that , for example , player @xmath5 s payoff when s / he plays @xmath9 and player @xmath1 plays @xmath10 , is same as the player @xmath1 s payoff when s / he plays @xmath10 and player @xmath5 plays @xmath9 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be either @xmath2 or @xmath12 . in words , in a symmetric game a player s payoff is determined by the strategy , and not by the identity , of a player .    for a symmetric game using subscripts in payoff relations",
    "becomes redundant as @xmath13 denotes payoff to an @xmath9-player against a @xmath10-player .",
    "this allows not to refer to players at all and to describe @xmath13 as the payoff to @xmath9-strategy against the @xmath10-strategy .",
    "the game given by the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) is symmetric when @xmath14 .",
    "the game of pd is a symmetric game , which is defined by the constraint @xmath15 .",
    "assume that , in random pair - wise contests , the strategy @xmath9 is played by a number of players whose relative proportion in the population is @xmath16 whereas the rest of the population plays the strategy @xmath17 .",
    "egt defines the fitnesses @xcite of the strategies @xmath9 and @xmath18 as    @xmath19    in terms of which the strategy @xmath17 is called an ess when @xmath20 i.e.    @xmath21    since @xmath22 , the terms containing @xmath16 can be ignored effectively .",
    "so @xmath23 implies @xmath24 . if , however , @xmath25 , we need to consider the terms containing @xmath16 . in this case",
    ", @xmath23 requires that @xmath26 .",
    "we then define an strategy @xmath17 to be evolutionarily stable iff for all strategies @xmath27 either    @xmath28    this definition shows that an ess is a symmetric ne  @xcite satisfying an additional stability property .",
    "the stability property ensures that  @xcite if an ess establishes itself in a population , it is able to withstand pressures of mutation and selection . using a game - theoretic wording , an ess is a refinement on the set of symmetric nash equilibria and , though being a static solution concept , it describes dynamic evolutionary situations .",
    "we consider game - theoretic solution - concept of an ess in quantum mechanical regime by observing that quantum mechanics can make only probabilistic predictions and any setup for a quantum game must have a probabilistic description .",
    "that is , when a quantum game is constructed using joint probabilities , even the so - called one - shot game must first be translated into some appropriate probabilistic version before one considers its quantum version .",
    "this translation permits us , in the following step , to introduce ( quantum mechanical ) joint probabilities ( that may not be factorizable ) and to find if and how such probabilities can change the outcome of the game .    to achieve this in view of the ess concept , we consider an epr - bohm type setting  @xcite consisting of a bipartite dichotomic physical system that the two players share to play the game ( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "this system can be described by the following @xmath29 joint probabilities @xmath30 with @xmath31 :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is player @xmath5 s outcome , that can have a dichotomic value of @xmath34 or @xmath35 , obtained when s / he plays the strategy @xmath2 or @xmath12 .",
    "we associate @xmath36 and @xmath37 that then assigns a value for @xmath38 . similarly , @xmath39 is player @xmath1 s outcome , that can have a dichotomic value of @xmath34 or @xmath35 , obtained when s / he plays the strategy @xmath2 or @xmath12 .",
    "the same association @xmath36 and @xmath37 then assigns a value for @xmath40 .",
    "for example , the joint probability corresponding to the situation when player @xmath5 s outcome @xmath33 is @xmath34 when s / he plays @xmath12 ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , while player @xmath1 s outcome @xmath42 is @xmath35 when s / he plays @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) , is obtained from ( cerenotation ) as @xmath44 .",
    "we now define players payoff relations when they play the game ( [ matrix ] ) using this ( probabilistic ) physical system to which the @xmath29 joint probabilities ( [ cerenotation ] ) correspond ,    @xmath45    where    @xmath46    here @xmath47 indicates transpose and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the probabilities , definable over a large number of runs , with which alice and bob choose the strategies @xmath2 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "joint probabilities are normalized i.e.    @xmath48    a nash equilibrium strategy pair @xmath49 is then obtained from the inequalities :    @xmath50    and a symmetric game , defined by the conditions ( [ symmetric game ] ) , is obtained when    @xmath51    as it is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in case joint probabilities are factorizable one can find @xmath52 $ ] such that  @xcite    @xmath53    and the nash inequalities ( [ ne ] ) are reduced to  @xcite    @xmath54    where r@xmath55  @xmath56  r@xmath57  @xmath58 .    when joint probabilities are factorizable , the conditions ( [ conds for symmetric game ] ) to obtain a symmetric game can be shown to reduce to @xmath59 and the payoff relations ( [ payoffs ] ) are then simplified to    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    and @xmath62 .",
    "the second inequality in ( [ ne ] ) is @xmath63 that becomes @xmath64 for a symmetric game .",
    "comparing it to the first inequality in ( [ ne ] ) gives @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the definition of a symmetric ne is reduced simply to @xmath67 .",
    "evaluating the two parts of the ess definition ( [ ess - def ] ) from a symmetric game payoff relations ( [ sym - game - payoffs ] ) we find    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "now @xmath71 and @xmath72 are evaluated using ( [ sym - game - payoffs - parts ] ) as    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 . recall that pd is defined by the constraints @xmath76 and we have @xmath77 , which asks for a natural association of the strategy of defection in pd to the strategy @xmath78 played in the present setting .",
    "when both players play this strategy we obtain from the eq .",
    "( [ sym - game - payoffs ] ) @xmath79 , which is the payoff to each player in the classical game when they both defect . with this association eqs .",
    "( [ ess - def - parts ] ) give @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which correspond to the first and second parts of the ess definition ( ess - def ) , respectively .",
    "for this strategy if we take    @xmath82    then the two parts of the ess definition are reduced to    @xmath83    as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , for pd both @xmath86 .",
    "as @xmath77 and @xmath87 is a probability we require the constraint @xmath88 so @xmath89 , from which one obtains @xmath90 i.e.    @xmath91    along with this , of course , we also have @xmath76 . the extra requirement ( [ extra - req ] ) defines a subset of the games that are put under the name of a generalized pd . for this game",
    "the result ( ess - factorizable ) states that the strategy @xmath78 is not an ess , though it is a symmetric ne , when joint probabilities are factorizable , in the sense described by ( [ factorizability ] ) , and have the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) imposed on them .",
    "there can be several different possible routes in obtaining a quantum game .",
    "the general idea is to establish correspondence , as a first step , between classical feature of a physical system and a classical game in the sense that classical game results because of those features . in the following step ,",
    "the classical feature are replaced by quantum feature , while the obtained correspondence in the first step is retained .",
    "one then looks at the impact which the quantum feature has on the solution / outcome of the game under consideration . as the mentioned correspondence",
    "can be established in several possible ways , there can be many different routes in obtaining a quantum game .    to consider ess in quantum pd we translate playing of this game in terms of factorizable joint probabilities , which is achieved in the previous section .",
