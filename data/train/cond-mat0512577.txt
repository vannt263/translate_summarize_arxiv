    "in our microscopic theoretical description of the charge response , electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) and lattice dynamics of the high - temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) in the framework of the linear response approach we focus on the specific features of their solid - state chemistry .",
    "this is different from the overwhelming number of attempts relying on simplified models with strongly reduced model hamiltonians .",
    "nevertheless , this seems necessary since the phenomena observed in the cuprates hardly even occur in the other known compounds .",
    "one important feature neglected for example in the popular models of hubbard type is the proximity of the htsc s , even in the optimally doped case , to the layered ionic crystals where besides short - ranged correlations strong long - range coulomb interaction and strong ( nonlocal ) epi exists . in the absence of full ab initio methods for the htsc s to tell us what the correct starting point would be , such insight is essential , besides the proximity of the materials to an antiferromagnetic state .",
    "models with strongly reduced electronic degrees of freedom may be useful for the discussion of theoretical ideas in general rather than for detailed calculations of the material specifica of the cuprates .",
    "the strong ionic nature of the htsc s is modeled in our approach by an ab - initio rigid ion model ( rim ) , used as a reference frame for the local ionic , rigid charge response and the epi , respectively . the important and characteristic nonlocal , non - rigid contribution to the electronic density response and the epi in the htsc s",
    "is calculated in terms of microscopically well defined charge- and dipole fluctuations ( cf s and df s ) .",
    "the latter are excitable on the electronic shells of the ions in the crystal .",
    "this is , because most of the charge in the htsc s contributing to bonding is concentrated on the latter .",
    "additionally , covalent metallic features of bonding are approximatively taken into account @xcite . in the calculations a sufficiently broad orbital freedom ( cu3d , cu4s and o2p )",
    ", the full three - dimensional coulomb interaction as well as the short - ranged local repulsions , in particular the important on - site repulsion mediated by the localized cu3d orbitals , is considered quantitatively .",
    "all the resulting couplings appearing in the dynamical matrix and the epi are microscopically well defined and can be calculated .",
    "the results obtained so far agree well with the experimental phonon dispersion .",
    "for a recent review , see ref . .",
    "the model for the electronic polarizability matrix @xcite @xmath1 of the optimally- , and overdoped metallic state of the htsc s , describing the kinetic part of the charge response , is obtained in a first step from the kohn - sham parameters ( usually interpreted as bandstructure ) within the local density approximation ( lda ) of density functional theory ( dft ) . the indices",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 denote the orbital degrees of freedom in the elementary cell of the crystal , i.e. cu3d , cu4s and o2p .",
    "@xmath4 is a wavevector in the first brillouin zone .",
    "however , such a model , applied to lacuo overestimates the coupling along the @xmath5-axis and thus underestimates the real anisotropy in the cuprates .",
    "modifications to improve the charge response along the ionic @xmath5-axis have been investigated in ref . .",
    "given the nearly two - dimensional electronic structure of the cuprates and thus a very weak interlayer coupling , electron dynamics and phonon dynamics will be on the same time - scale in a small region around the @xmath5-axis .",
    "this needs a non - adiabatic treatment with dynamical screening of the bare coulomb interaction and phonon - plasmon mixing in the metallic state of the htsc s @xcite .    in the absence of a rigorous quantitative description for the insulating ( undoped ) state of the htsc",
    "s , the model for @xmath6 has been designed to be consistent with the characteristic electronic charge response for an insulator with a gap in the charge excitation spectrum .",
    "this is achieved by fulfilling rigorous sum rules for the density response in terms of the polarizability matrix in the long - wavelength - limit @xcite .",
    "these sum rules , see section [ secthree ] , can be considered as orbital resolved closed forms to represent the change of the charge response in a metal - insulator transition in terms of the electronic polarizability or the compressibility of the electronic system , respectively , as a primary tool to characterize the ground state .",
    "finally , a suitable model is proposed for the underdoped state of the p - doped htsc s , where a description of the low - energy excitations remains a theoretical challenge and where the question how the metallic charge conduction emerges from the doped insulator is poorly understood .",
    "this model describes a novel metallic state with an insulator - like , incompressible charge response related to the localized cu3d orbitals at the cu sublattice interspersed with a metallic , compressible charge response related to the more delocalized o2p orbitals at the oxygen sublattices of the cuo plane . in this way a partial ordering of the conducting carriers in the cuo plane is obtained . with regard to our modeling of the metallic state for the optimally and",
    "overdoped htsc s such an ergodicity breaking delocalization - localization transition in the underdoped state in terms of the compressibility means a compartmentalization of configuration space .",
    "this means that some parts of configuration space can not be approached or are hardly accessible to the particles . on the other hand , this should be accompanied by a reciprocal compartmentalization of momentum space , according to the uncertainty relationship @xmath7 . indeed , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies in underdoped cuprates @xcite , reporting a  two component  electronic structure with a pseudogap around @xmath8 and only part of the fermi surface surviving as an  arc  around the node , point to compartmentalization of momentum space too .",
    "the compartmentalization of momentum space counteracts the reduction of the electron scattering rate brought about by the pauli - principle in a fermi - liquid , at least partially .",
    "thus , the scattering rate and the life time of the carriers no longer will follow the well known scaling with energy and temperature of a fermi - liquid .",
    "consequently , the normal state should display non - fermi - liquid properties in our model for the underdoped state of the cuprates , also seen in the experiment . in the corresponding superconducting state",
    "an increase of the kinetic energy as in bcs by the ",
    "smearing  of the fermi surface would not be present because the latter is not developed .",
    "on the other hand , phase coherence in a phase ordering scenario would enhance the mobility of pairs and decrease the kinetic energy .",
    "such a description of a delocalization - localization crossover of the electronic structure ( e.g. due to doping ) accompanied by a pseudogap phenomenon in terms of consecutive orbital - selective compressibility - incompressibility transitions in the presence strong nonlocal epi may also be useful to model the charge correlations in other systems besides the cuprates characterized by a mixture of localized and delocalized orbitals .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sectwo ] the theory and modeling is briefly reviewed to set the frame .",
    "section [ secthree ] presents our calculated results of the phonon dispersion for the underdoped and overdoped state of lacuo .",
    "moreover , the phonon anomalies related to the high - frequency oxygen bond - stretching modes and the phonon density of states for the insulating , underdoped , optimally doped and overdoped state of lacuo are calculated .",
    "a discussion of the modeling of the electronic state in the cuprates consistent with the corresponding phonon calculations is provided .",
    "finally , a summary will be presented in section [ secfour ] .",
    "from a general point of view our treatment of the electronic density response and lattice dynamics in terms of df s and cf s can be considered as a microscopic ( semi - ab - initio ) implementation of the phenomenological dipole - shell model or the charge - fluctuation models , respectively . for a general formulation of phenomenological models for lattice dynamics that use localized electronic variables as adiabatic degrees of freedom ,",
    "see for example ref . .",
    "this formulation covers shell models , bond - charge models and charge - fluctuation models . while in this approach",
    "the coupling coefficients are treated as empirical fitting parameters , the essential point in our microscopic scheme is that all the couplings can be calculated .    in the following a survey of the theory and modeling",
    "is presented .",
    "a detailed description can be found in ref . and in particular in ref . where the calculation of the coupling parameters is presented .",
    "the local part of the electronic charge response and the epi is approximated in the spirit of the quasi - ion approach @xcite by an ab initio rigid ion model ( rim ) taking into account covalent ion softening in terms of ( static ) effective ionic charges calculated from a tight - binding analysis ( tba ) .",
    "in addition , scaling of the short - ranged part of certain pair potentials between the ions is performed to simulate further covalence effects in the calculation in such a way that the energy - minimized structure is as close as possible to the experimental one @xcite .",
    "structure optimization and energy minimization is very important for a reliable calculation of the phonon dynamics through the dynamical matrix .",
    "the rim with the corrections just mentioned then serves as an unbiased reference system for the description of the htsc s and can be considered as a first approximation for the insulating state of these compounds .",
    "starting with such an unprejudiced rigid reference system non - rigid electronic polarization processes are introduced in form of more or less localized electronic charge - fluctuations ( cf s ) at the outer shells of the ions . especially in the metallic state of the htsc",
    "s the latter dominate the nonlocal contribution of the electronic density response and the epi and are particularly important in the cuo planes .",
    "in addition , _ anisotropic _ dipole - fluctuations ( df s ) are admitted in our approach @xcite , which prove to be specificly of interest for the ions in the ionic layers mediating the dielectric coupling and for the polar modes .",
    "thus , the basic variable of our model is the ionic density which is given in the perturbed state by    @xmath9    @xmath10 is the density of the unperturbed ion , as used in the rim , localized at the sublattice @xmath11 of the crystal and moving rigidly with the latter under displacement .",

    "the dipole density @xmath15 is obtained from a modified sternheimer method in the framework of lda - sic @xcite .",
    "all sic - calculations are performed for the average spherical shell in the orbital - averaged form according to perdew and zunger @xcite . for the correlation part of the energy per electron @xmath18 the parametrization given in ref . has been used .",
    "the total energy of the crystal is obtained by assuming that the density can be approximated by a superposition of overlapping densities @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath10 in eq .",
    "are also calculated within lda - sic taking environment effects , via a watson sphere potential and the calculated static effective charges of the ions into account .",
    "the watson sphere method is only used for the oxygen ions and the depth of the watson sphere potential is set as the madelung potential at the corresponding site .",
    "such an approximation holds well in the htsc s @xcite . as a general rule ,",
    "partial covalence reduces the amplitude of the static effective charges in mixed ionic - covalent compounds like the htsc s , because the charge transfer from the cations to the anions is not complete as in the entirely ionic case . finally , applying the pair - potential approximation we get for the total energy :    @xmath20    the energy @xmath21 depends on both the configuration of the ions @xmath22 and the electronic ( charge ) degrees of freedom ( edf ) @xmath23 of the charge density , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 in eq .",

    "in contrast to the metallic state , _ off - diagonal _ elements of the polarizability matrix describing _ nonlocal _ polarization processes necessarily must occur and interfere in order to correlate the charge response in such a way that eqs .",
    ", are satisfied .",
    "physically this is related to the fact that in an insulator a perturbation , e. g. a change of the electron - ion potential , is only incompletely screened .",
    "consequently , the selfconsistent change of the potential at the orbital degree of freedom @xmath3 nonlocally contributes to the cf s of the orbital @xmath94 in the unit cell .",
    "this is quite different from the metallic case where the diagonal elements of @xmath6 dominate and off - diagonal elements can be neglected in most cases . as mentioned in the introduction , the model for the polarizability of the metallic state is based on lda calculations which , however , have to be modified to correct for the overestimation of the @xmath5-axis coupling in lda - based investigations @xcite .",
    "so , a model taking into account cu3d , 4s , 4p , and o@xmath952p orbitals in the cuo plane results @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cu4s orbital the effect of the cu4p orbital on the phonon dynamics is only weak , so we have neglected the latter in the present calculations and enhanced the contribution of @xmath96 slightly . besides the cf s also anisotropic df s",

    "the resulting calculated phonon dispersion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "we get an overall agreement with the experimental dispersion curves .",
    "a few branches show larger deviations between experiment and theory .",
    "however , in particular the important phonon anomalies ( high - frequency oxygen bond - stretching modes ) , which are a major theme in the recent literature and the present paper , too , are well described by our theory , see fig.[fig04 ] below .",
    "this also holds true for the steep @xmath97 branch which results from the large anisotropy of the real material and can not be described with pure lda based calculations leading to an overestimation of the coupling along the @xmath5-axis , see ref .",
    "freezing - in the unstable @xmath98 tilt mode at the @xmath99 point correctly indicates the experimentally observed structural phase transition from the high - temperature tetragonal ( htt ) to the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) structure .",
    "the actual transition , of course , can not be studied in the harmonic approximation because the anharmonic contribution to the energy must be considered @xcite . however , from our calculations in ref .",
    "we find that the soft tilt mode found in htt is stabilized in lto in harmonic approximation and thus the structural transition is essentially driven by the long - ranged ionic forces in the material .",
    "the non - empirical potential - induced breathing ( pib ) model @xcite like our model reflects the strong tendencies to ionic forces in the htsc s .",
    "this model also correctly predicts , that the tetragonal structure is unstable to the @xmath99-point tilt mode .",
    "however , it can not be applied to the metallic phase .",
    "moreover , other unstable phonon branches are found in this model .",
    "the width of the phonon spectrum is considerably overestimated .",
    "for example , the pib result for the planar oxygen breathing mode at the @xmath99-point in the insulating phase is about 34 thz in comparsion to the experiment ( @xmath100 21.8 thz ) and to our calculated result of 21.6 thz , see fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "the pib results are comparable to our calculations performed with the ab - initio rigid ion model using nominal ionic charges @xcite , neglecting the covalence correction for the ionic charges and the pair potential .",
    "taking the latter effects into account , as mentioned in section [ sectwo ] , the correct width of the spectrum is obtained and , with the exception of the tilt mode at @xmath99 , all unstable phonon branches disappear @xcite .",
    "so , we obtain a suitable reference system for the htsc which allows for the investigation of the additional nonlocal , non - rigid screening effects in terms of cf s and df s .",
    "empirical shell model calculations for the lattice dynamics of several cuprates have been performed in ref . .",
    "the fitting to the experimental results is quite satisfactorily emphasizing again the importance of the ionic forces .",
    "however , in the fitting the harmonic @xmath99-point tilt - mode was assumed to be stable , which is at least questionable , because of the low temperature orthorhombic structure . for a description of the metallic phase free - carrier screening of the homogeneous electron gas",
    "is additional assumed , but the softening of the phonon anomalies can not be accounted for by this type of screening . on the other hand , our calculations , see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , lead to very good results for the phonon anomalies .",
    "accordingly , we can relate the anomalous softening to the characteristic ionic , inhomogenous electronic structure of the htsc , leading to strong nonlocal epi in terms of localized cf s in the outer shells of the ions controlled by the coupling coefficient @xmath55 in eq .    in the model for the insulating phase in order to simulate stronger correlation effects as in the metal cu4s orbitals",
    "are neglected and only the cf s of the cu3d orbitals at the cu and o2p orbitals at the o@xmath95 are considered as on site cf s and the polarizability is adjusted so as to obey the sum rules from eq . .",
    "the calculated results for the phonon dispersion can be found in ref . .",
    "similarily as for the metallic state a good agreement with the experiments is obtained . in particular , a significant reduction of the phonon anomalies as compared to the optimally doped material is well reproduced and attributed to the incompressibility of the electronic state . including the screening contribution via anisotropic df s , the longitudinal and transverse optical modes of @xmath101 and @xmath102 symmetry are well described .",
    "an ab initio calculation of the polarizability @xmath66 for the htsc s , which besides strong electron correlations also should include the strong nonlocal epi found in our calculations in the self - energy of the electrons , seems not possible in the near future . in particular",
    "this holds for the insulating and underdoped state .",
    "however , modeling @xmath66 according to the the sum rules - guarantees that the constraints on the charge response in the different phases are fulfilled and , moreover , allows for the possibility to theoretically design condensed matter states with properties between that of a conventional metal and an insulator , respectively .",
    "this seems necessary to describe the physics in the underdoped cuprates where a strange metallic state does appear .",
    "our modeling of the correlation phenomenon and the delocalization - localization transition from the metallic state of the htsc s via the underdoped state to the undoped ( insulating ) state has been achieved with help of the sum rules by consecutive orbital selective compressibility - incompressibility transitions , see ref . , and for a detailed review ref . .",
    "starting from the metallic side , representing in our model the doping range from optimally doped to overdoped , all the admitted orbitals , i.e. cu3d , 4s and o2p , are taken to be compressible , metallic consistent with an emerging quasi - particle description and a well defined fermi surface .",

    "our calculation of the orbital occupation numbers @xcite from a tba of the first principles electronic ( metallic ) bandstructure of lacuo @xcite indicates that besides the cu3d in particular the more delocalized cu4s state must be included as an additional edf at the cu site .",
    "this , as already mentioned , is different from our modeling of the insulating - and underdoped state where we have neglected a contribution from the cu4s orbitals and only used the localized cu3d - and the o2p orbitals as edf s in order to simulate stronger correlation effects in these states .    approaching the delocalization - localization transition from the metallic region when p - doping is decreased first the cu3d component of the wavefunction is admitted in our model to become incompressible , insulator - like in the underdoped regime by assuming that the corresponding single particle density of states @xmath103 is suppressed at the fermi level for the correlated localized cu3d orbitals , because of the cost in energy from hopping of the charge carrier to the cu sites , but not so for the more delocalized o2p orbitals at the o@xmath95-sublattices in the cuo plane where the holes are predominantly injected to in p - type cuprates .",

    "the corresponding electronic state for this model ( pseudogap model , pgm ) expressing the dichotomy between a localized and delocalized component has been defined by the following sum rule @xcite ,    @xmath106    we realize from this equation , that nonlocal polarization processes are necessary to depress the density of states at @xmath107 via the cu3d component and correspondingly the low energy single particle excitations .",
    "finally , near half filling in addition to cu3d , the o2p component of the electronic state has been modeled as incompressible too , and the charge - transfer insulator is formed according to the sum rules , for both the cu3d and o2p orbitals .",

    "a more detailed discussion of the phonon anomalies is given below .",
    "another difference of the theoretical results as compared with those of the insulating state given in ref .",
    "is of _ qualitative _ nature and is related to the axial polarized @xmath97-branches . in the modeling of the underdoped state we have",
    "partially incompressible regions , however , the total compressibility is never zero in this state , because a real space organization of the low lying charge excitations is allowed and a metallic ( gapless ) charge transport is enabled via the hole - doped o2p orbitals at the oxygen network in the cuo plane . as a consequence the @xmath101 mode splittings",
    "are closed due to metallic screening , in particular the very large  ferroelectric ",
    "mode splitting , observed and calculated in the insulating state @xcite and the @xmath97-branch with the steep dispersion characteristic for metallic behaviour , being absent in the insulating state , reappears as is visible from fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .",
    "altogether , we conclude that our modeling of the insulating , underdoped and optimally doped state of lacuo is consistent with the measured phonon dispersion .",
    "we now discuss some qualitative aspects of our modeling of the electronic state of the cuprates suggested by the phonon calculations . in the model for the underdoped state",
    "a metallic mobility behaviour is mediated via the o2p component of the wavefunction localized at the oxygen network of the cuo plane where the holes are injected too , but blocked along the cu - o links because of the large on - site repulsion of the cu3d component .",
    "thus , by this partial ordering we have hole rich and hole poor regions of the conducting carriers on a microscopic scale in a translational invariant way ultimately driven by competing energy contributions .",
    "note , that the various inhomogeneous selforganized charge and spin ordered configurations discussed in the litertature @xcite formally can be considered as certain  defect structures ",
    "( e.g. stripes ) of our model if the spin - degrees of freedom are explicitly considered . in case such structures",
    "are experimentally observed they express the tendency to restore an insulating mott state in certain extended ( incompressible ) regions of the material .    from an energetic point of view",
    "the ground state should simultaneously minimize the zero point kinetic energy of the doped charge carriers and the exchange energy where both compete which each other . because of the incompressible localized cu3d states the holes are expelled from the antiferromagnetic regions by coulomb correlation .",
    "thus , an independent particle picture where an electron feels a time - averaged local density of the other electrons with a corresponding local potential ( like e.g. in lda ) no longer holds . in this way",
    "the exchange energy is optimized ( no spins need to be switched because of the restricted motion of the holes ) while on the other hand , there is a gain in kinetic energy in the hole rich regions by delocalization of the electronic structure ( hopping of the holes ) via the compressible , metallic o2p component of the wavefunction . at the same time the exchange energy can be neglected in this region of configuration space if the delocalization effect is strong enough .",
    "spin degrees of freedom and their correlations are not explicitly included in our modeling but implicitly support the latter because residual antiferromagnetic correlations can lead to an additional lowering of the kinetic energy by virtually hopping to the cu3d states .",
    "this correlates the charge transport in the regions of excess charge to the remaining antiferromagnetic spin order in the hole poor regions at the cu sublattice .",
    "so , we have a picture that can be regarded as resulting from a kind of separation of spin and charge , being mutually relevant in different regions of the cuo plane .",
    "low energy charge excitations occur in the hole rich regions where spin effects are depressed but are blocked in the hole poor regions , where the spin degrees of freedom are most important at low energy and high - energy ( virtual ) cf s induce an antiferromagnetic coupling on the cu sublattice .",
    "then , in our modeling of the metallic state at higher doping the cu3d and the additionally allowed delocalized cu4s component become compressible , metallic .",
    "the incompressibility of cu3d can be thought to be destroyed by an increased population of the cu4s orbital . in ref .",
    "it has been shown that the cu4s admixture to the electronic states of the htsc is relevant and due to a gain in correlation energy .",
    "the dominant charge transfer resulting from the atomic correlations is from the localized cu3d to the more delocalized cu4s orbitals .",
    "the calculations in ref . are based on an ab - initio method ( local ansatz method ) that adds correlations as corrections to a single - particle self - consistent ground state obtained from a hartree - fock calculation .",
    "an increased hybridization of cu4s with the @xmath110 orbitals can be expected to further relaxing the kinetic energy when doping is increased . as a consequence ,",
    "the blocking of the metallic charge response at the cu sites in the underdoped state is lifted and metallic behaviour is now also possible via the cuo links .",
    "altogether , this seems to be consistent with an emerging quasiparticle picture , a progressively weakening of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations and the development of a well defined fermi surface as described by the sum rules from eqs .",
    ", in our approach .",
    "the growing importance of the cu4s component in the wavefunction leading to enhanced delocalized cf s at the cu sites in the screening process is also mapped to a corresponding renormalization of the phonon anomalies as compared to the situation where the latter are neglected , see ref . and",
    "the discussion below .",
    "so , from our calculation additionally to cu3d and o2p an increasing contribution of the delocalized cu4s component to the metallic state of the cuprates is important to understand the charge response and the corresponding phonon softening in the real material at least at higher doping levels .    the importance of the cu4s orbital for a realistic description of the electronic structure of the htsc s has also been pointed out in ref . and ref .",
    "in the latter work , the hopping range has been identified as an essential material - dependent parameter and the intralayer hopping beyond nearest neighbours as well as the interlayer hopping proceeds via the cu4s orbital .",
    "it ist further concluded that materials with higher @xmath111 have larger hopping ranges and in materials with highest @xmath111 the axial orbital , essentially a hybrid between cu4s , cu3d@xmath112 and apical oxygen 2p@xmath113 , is almost pure cu4s .",
    "moreover , the importance of cu4s for an accurate description of the partial charge distributions in the htsc s is pointed out applying the  local ansatz  ab initio method , which allows to add correlations as corrections to a hartree - fock ground state@xcite or density functional theory @xcite , respectively .",
    "now we address the question concerning the possible nature of a superconducting state of the htsc s that would be consistent with our modeling of the normal state . the suppression of the local cf s in our model for the underdoped state related to the incompressible cu3d orbitals due to the large on - site repulsion competes with the superconductivity because of the enhanced phase fluctuations according to the number - phase uncertainty relationship @xmath114 . in such a phase",
    "disordered superconductor pairing without long - range phase coherence is possible , i.e. there is an intermediate temperature range @xmath115 where electron pairs exist which have not condensed .",
    "such a precursor pair formation scenario is for example discussed in context with a kinetic energy driven pairing mechanism related to certain self organized local charge inhomogenities in form of stripes @xcite where pairing originates from strong repulsive interactions .",
    "pair formation is thought to be realized in form of spin singlet pairs resulting in a spin gap by the  spin gap proximity  effect @xcite because it seems favourable that , under appropriate circumstances , the pairs can spread out somewhat into the antiferromagnetic neighbourhood of a stripe .",
    "however , up to now there is no experiment that proves the pairing is either kinetic energy driven or due to stripes .",
    "note in this context , that the stripe scenario has been questioned by recent experiments which find that the observed nanoscale disorder in the htsc s is due to dopant disorder @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the possibility of precursor pairs of some kind is theoretically explored , the strong nonlocal epi found in our calculations expressed by the corresponding large changes of the self - consistent potential an electron feels according to eq .",
    ", in particular for the generic phonon anomalies @xcite and even larger for the non - adiabatic @xmath5-axis phonons @xcite , should be taken into account in the electronic self - energy and the polarizability besides the short - ranged electron - electron repulsion that leads to spin- and charge correlations in a many body treatment of a preformed pair state and the resulting gaps in the normal as well in the superconducting state .",
    "for a recent review of the important role of the epi for the normal state properties and the pairing in the htsc s we also refer to ref . .",
    "altogether , in the normal state one can expect two types of gaps in our modeling for the underdoped htsc s the  correlation gap  and consistent with that modeling possibly a ",
    "precursor pairing gap  which are both linked by the short - ranged correlations introduced through the localized , incompressible cu3d orbitals .",
    "while the former gap should correspond to the high - energy pseudogap seen in arpes , the latter might be related to the low - energy gap found by the same experimental technique @xcite .",
    "different from the underdoped state in our modeling of the optimally doped metallic state _",
    "all _ the orbitals become compressible , metallic with enhanced cf s particularly in the cu4s orbitals .",
    "so , we have a qualitative change to an electronic ground state with a well defined fermi surface . in such a state",
    "a fermi surface instability with a simultaneous evolution of pairs of quasi particles would be consistent with the normal state and can lead to a bcs - type ordering . with regard to predominantly a phase ordering transition in the underdoped state optimal doping with a maximal @xmath0 can be thought of as defining a gradual crossover to an overdoped state with predominantly a bcs - type pairing transition .",
    "arguments in favour of such a crossover scenario also have been presented in ref . .",
    "according to the modeling of the charge response supported by our phonon calculations there are higher energy cf s related to the localized cu3d orbital and low energy cf s of the more delocalized o2p - and especially the cu4s orbitals and a critical mixing of both via a population of cu4s and a corresponding change of the populations of cu3d and o2p and the related hybridization obviously is required to achieve @xmath111 in the optimally doped material .",
    "the localization - delocalization transition in the normal state expressed as an incompressibility - compressibility transition of the cu3d states corresponds to a phase ordering - pairing transition in the superconducting state .",
    "next , we report new calculations of the phonon dispersion for the overdoped state of lacuo which can be compared with recent experimental results for the phonon anomalies @xcite .",
    "an important message from these calculations is a further growing of the importance of the delocalized cu4s component in the electronic wave function which seems consistent with an improved fermi liquid quasi - particle picture , an increased coupling along the @xmath5-axis and the dying out of the antiferromagnetic correlations , and an epi which becomes more local .    in earlier calculations",
    "@xcite we already have recognized the inclusion of cu4s into the orbital basis as an important  tuning parameter  for the delocalization of the electronic structure of the htsc s and the strength of the phonon anomalies .",

    "on the other hand , certain charge inhomogeneities observed in the htsc s because of the reduced screening will couple nonlocally to the lattice and additional softening , compared with the system free of inhomogeneities , of the oxygen - bond - stretching - like modes ( obsm ) can be expected due to the sensitivity of the latter to charge doping as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "for example , in the presence of a periodic charge order at a certain wavevector compatible with its period , anomalous softening and related mode splitting according to the broken rotational and translational symmetry should occur . also non - periodic",

    "strong phonon softening of the obsm has been observed in htsc s at doping levels associated with static stripes at a wave vector corresponding to the charge order . from the calculated results of the anomalies in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] for the system with unbroken symmetry it can be expected that the strength of the anomalies in the inhomogeneous case sensitively should depend on the possibility of the inhomogeneous structure ( e. g. stripe ) to be incompressible , insulating or compressible , metallic , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the electron correlation which result in an antiferromagnetic spin correlation in the htsc s should favour the cf s in the obsm and enhance screening against the tendency of a suppression of the cf s by the large on - site repulsion at the cu , because if the spins in neighbouring cu orbitals were to be parallel , they would not both to be able to transfer to the neighbouring oxygens or between the cu ions themselves . on the other hand , if they are antiparallel they can do .",

    "these cf s , however , are _ qualitatively _ different in the insulating and the metallic state , respectively , because of the gap for charge excitations in the insulator .",
    "this helps to understand the anomalous softening of the mode during the insulator - metal transition . as has been shown in ref .",
    "the cf s @xmath148 from eq . are constrained in the insulator with cf s allowed at the cu and o@xmath95 sublattices according to the following sum rule    @xmath149    the sum over @xmath2 denotes the cf s in the cuo layer .",
    "@xmath150 , so eq . particularly holds at the @xmath144 point of the brillouin - zone .",
    "in contrast to the constraint expressed by eq . for the insulating state , which means that local charge neutrality of the cell is maintained under a perturbation due to o@xmath119 ,",
    "no such a restriction is present for the metallic state . unlike for lacuo in the insulating state ,",
    "where only _ intra - layer _ charge rearrangements according to the sum rule eq . are allowed ( fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] ) , in the metallic state o@xmath119 induces cf s at cu and o@xmath95 that have the same sign in the whole cuo layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] ) .",
    "this finally leads to cf s of alternating sign in consecutive cuo layers , i.e. to an _ inter - plane _ charge transfer in the adiabatic regime that provides an effective screening mechanism for the long - range coulomb interactions and generates the anomalous mode softening of o@xmath119 during the insulator - metal transition .          in the last topic of this paper we present calculations for the phonon - density of states of lacuo",
    "according to our modeling of the insulating- , under- , optimally- and overdoped state of the htsc s .",
    "experimental studies by inelastic neutron spectroscopy of the phonon - density of states of lacuo report unusual shifts for high - frequency obsm during the insulator - metal transition indicating a strong epi @xcite .",
    "similar results are found for lacuo in ref . where besides a shift of the high - frequency part of the spectrum to lower frequencies the development of ",
    "new\"oxygen lattice vibrations centered in the optimally doped probe around 70 mev are observed near the doping induced insulator - metal transition and attributed to the mixing of these vibrations with metallic cf s .        our calculations for the phonon - density of states displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig09 ] , [ fig10 ] allow for a detailed study of the changes of the spectrum during the insulator - metal transition . with the help of the calculated atom - resolved phonon - density of states in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] and the phonon dispersion the characteristic modes indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] can be identified .",
    "the peak denoted as @xmath151 is caused by vibrations of the apex - oxygen , o@xmath113 .",
    "@xmath152 is related to the high - frequency oxygen vibrations , @xmath102 , at the @xmath153 point polarized in the cuo plane .",
    "@xmath55 is the planar oxygen breathing mode , o@xmath131 , and @xmath154 results from the oxygen half - breathing mode ( @xmath118 mode ) . in agreement with the experiments we find globally a shift of the high - frequency part of the phonon - density of states and also the development of spectral weight ( peak @xmath154 ,",
    "see also fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( c ) ) passing from the insulating to the metallic state which we can assign to the @xmath118 anomaly at 69 mev in our calculations for the optimally doped phase .",
    "thus , the  new ",
    "oxgen lattice vibrations found in the experiments consist dominantly of the half - breathing modes , as supposed in ref .",
    ". an important change of the spectrum related to the insulator - metal transition can be extracted from figs .",
    "[ fig09 ] , [ fig10 ] , because @xmath152(@xmath102 ) and @xmath55(o@xmath131 ) are interchanged .",
    "so we have not just a global softening but also a very characteristic rearrangement of the high - frequency part of the spectrum , linked to the development of the phonon anomalies and the corresponding softening upon doping .",
    "within our microscopic modeling of the insulating- , underdoped- , optimally- and overdoped electronic state of the htsc s we have performed calculations for lacuo of the complete phonon dispersion curves , dynamic charge inhomogeneities induced by nonlocal epi and the total - and atom - resolved phonon density of states .",
    "our calculations emphasize the role of the doping dependence of the generic phonon anomalies and their selective sensitivity to both localization ( correlation ) effects provided by the cu3d orbitals and delocalization effects via the cu4s states .",
    "thus , these anomalies are suitable probes to mirror the localization - delocalization transition of the electronic structure of the cuprates in terms of phonons .",
    "we have found good agreement with the corresponding measured phonon dispersion and phonon - density of states and have presented an interpretation of the results . in order to reach these results , both , long - ranged coulomb interactions of ionic origin as well as short - ranged repulsiv interactions together with a sufficient set of orbital degrees of freedom are neccesary .",
    "a purely ionic model leads to a considerable overestimation of the width of the phonon spectrum and to unstable branches besides the tilt mode . including additionally covalent corrections a suitable starting model for the htsc",
    "can be found that cures the disadvantages of the pure ionic description .",
    "using such a model as an unprejudiced _ rigid _ reference system the effects of the important nonlocal _ non - rigid _ electronic polarization processes in terms of localized cf s and df s have been studied . the latter localized screening effects and",
    "not a homogenous electron gas screening allows for a quantitative calculation of the phonon anomalies and the dispersion . by the present investigations our earlier studies",
    "have been extended to the underdoped and overdoped state .",
    "predictions of the dispersion in the latter case have been made .",
    "an important aspect of the calculations , besides the efforts to explore the phonon dynamics and the epi in the htsc s as strongly correlated systems , where these topics presently are not well understood , in particular in the insulating- and underdoped state , is to give additional support to our modeling of the electronic state .",
    "this is achieved in terms of consecutive orbital selective incompressibility - compressibility transitions .",
    "such a modeling of the normal state qualitatively also provides a possible picture of the superconducting state that points from a phase ordering transition in the underdoped regime to a bcs - like pairing transition for higher doping .",
    "optimal @xmath0 should mark a gradual crossover point .",
    "the localization - delocalization crossover in our approach corresponding to a phase ordering - pair ordering crossover in the superconducting state is essentially related to the increase of an occupation with doping of the delocalized cu4s orbitals progressively mixing into the cu3d - o2p dominated electronic state of the underdoped material .",
    "simultaneously an emerging quasiparticle picture with a well defined fermi surface is consistent with our modeling upon doping .",
    "finally , the strong and material specific nonlocal epi effects found in the calculations demonstrate the important role of the phonons for the physics of the cuprates .",
