    "tverberg s 1966 theorem @xcite , which states that any set of @xmath1 points in @xmath2 can be partitioned into @xmath3 subsets whose convex hulls intersect , is a seminal result that has inspired many interesting variations , extensions , and analogues  starting with the `` topological tverberg theorem '' of brny , shlosman & szcs @xcite and zaydin  @xcite .",
    "see section [ sec : tverberg s theorem and its relatives ] for a brief review and matouek @xcite for a friendly textbook treatment .    here",
    "we propose a new , simple and elementary , proof technique that combines a concept of `` tverberg unavoidable subcomplexes '' ( which contain at least _ one _ simplex from each tverberg partition ) , see section  [ sec : t - unavoidable - subcomplexes ] , with the observation that tverberg points that equalize the distance from such a subcomplex can be obtained from maps to an extended target space , see section  [ sec : constraining_function ] .",
    "this technique allows us to derive many of the variations and analogues directly from the original topological tverberg theorem with surprising ease .",
    "for example , our ansatz produces _ directly from the topological tverberg theorem _ a colored version that is stronger than ivaljevi & vreica s 1992 `` colored tverberg s theorem '' @xcite ( but weaker than the _ optimal _ colored tverberg theorem @xcite from 2009 ) ; see section  [ sec : colored ] .",
    "similarly we obtain directly from the topological tverberg theorem a strengthened version of the `` generalized van kampen  flores theorem '' of sarkaria @xcite and volovikov @xcite from 1991/1996 ; see section  [ sec : prescribing_dimensions ] . as another example",
    ", our machinery reproves sobern s 2013 `` tverberg theorem with equal barycentric coordinates '' and at the same time produces a new topological version of this result ; see section  [ sec : soberon ] .",
    "our machinery uses the topological tverberg theorem as a _ black box _ : it provides the core for our proofs , but the proof technique relies only on the result , not on its proof .",
    "thus , for example , an extension of the topological tverberg theorem to some @xmath3 that are not prime powers would immediately yield the same extension for our derived results . in place of the black box result",
    "we can also use the optimal colored tverberg theorem ; in section  [ sec : optimal ] we thus obtain further results of the `` colored tverberg '' type . the black box result can also be replaced by tverberg s original theorem if the constraint functions are affine ; in this case no prime power restriction on the number of parts is needed .",
    "thus we obtain a new affine version of the topological tverberg theorem for @xmath0-wise disjoint simplices ; see section  [ sec : j - wise ] .",
    "similarly , from the tverberg theorem for maps to manifolds by volovikov @xcite one `` automatically '' gets extensions of our results for maps to manifolds .",
    "for every drawing of a tetrahedron in the plane either a vertex will end up on top of the opposite face or two opposite edges intersect in the drawing .",
    "this is a first instance of a tverberg type result , which holds true in any dimension as was proved by johann radon ( 1921 ) :    _ _    radon s theorem . for any subset @xmath4 with ( at least ) @xmath5 elements",
