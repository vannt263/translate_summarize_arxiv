    "the sensitivity of exoplanet detection instrumentation and techniques has dramatically improved over the past decade .",
    "this has enabled significant progress towards the detection of terrestrial - sized exoplanets using the radial velocity and transit methods . in particular , the _ kepler _ mission has yielded a plethora of exoplanet candidates @xcite , many of which have been confirmed by virtue of their multiplicity @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of the _ kepler _ mission is to determine the frequency of earth - sized planets in the habitable zone ( hz ) , which is the region around a star where water can exist in a liquid state on the surface of a planet with sufficient atmospheric pressure .",
    "several earth - sized planets have been located in this region as a result of these _ kepler _ observations @xcite .",
    "the inner and outer boundaries of the hz for various main sequence stars have been estimated using one - dimensional climate models by @xcite .",
    "these boundary estimates have been revised in recent years by the same group , including the extension to later spectral types @xcite and the consideration of different planetary masses @xcite .",
    "the hz calculations are available through the habitable zone gallery @xcite , which provides hz calculations for all known exoplanetary systems .",
    "an important aspect of these hz calculations is that they provide a means to estimate the fraction of stars with earth - size planets in the hz , or @xmath4 .",
    "much of the recent calculations of @xmath4 utilize _ kepler _ results since these provide a large sample of terrestrial size objects from which to perform meaningful statistical analyses @xcite .",
    "the transit method has a dramatic bias towards the detection of planets which are closer to the host star than farther away @xcite .",
    "for example , the geometric transit probabilities of mercury , venus , and earth for an external observer are 1.2% , 0.64% , and 0.46% respectively .",
    "additionally , a shorter orbital period will result in an increased signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the transit signature due to the increased number of transits observed within a given timeframe .",
    "the consequence of this is that _ kepler _ has preferentially detected planets interior to the hz which are therefore more likely to be potential venus analogs than earth analogs .",
    "an example of this is kepler-69c which was initially thought to be a strong hz candidate @xcite but subsequent analysis showed that it s more likely to be a super - venus @xcite . since the divergence of the earth / venusian atmospheric evolutions is a critical component for understanding earth s habitability , the frequency of venus analogs ( @xmath1 ) is also important to quantify .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in this section , we will calculate the occurrence rate of terrestrial size planets that receive a flux which puts them between the runaway greenhouse limit and atmospheric erosion caused by incident stellar flux .",
    "we call this region the `` venus zone '' ( vz ) to identify those exoplanets that are either in the runaway greenhouse state or in the process of losing their atmosphere due to the close proximity to their host star ( see section [ bound ] )",
    ". the extent of the vz and hz boundaries are shown in the left panel of figure [ koihz ] as a function of stellar effective temperature .",
    "we calculate the occurence rate of vz planets for gkm stellar spectral types , using the data from @xcite ( for m - dwarfs ) and @xcite ( for k & g - dwarfs ) .",
    "both these studies calculate the planet occurrence rate based on the following equation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the semi - major axis of planet @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the host star s radius of planet @xmath7 , @xmath9 is the number of stars around which planet @xmath7 could have been detected and @xmath10 is the number of planets with the radius @xmath11 and period @xmath12 .",
    "the ratio @xmath13 is the inverse of the probability of transit orientation , which is considered to take non - transiting geometries into the estimation of occurrence rate .",
    "@xcite use @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the completeness correction factor for each @xmath16 bin , and @xmath17 stars in their survey of brightest ( kepler magnitude 1015 ) gk spectral types .",
    "to calculate the occurrence rate for m - dwarfs , we use the @xmath9 values provided within the period - radii cells of figure 15 of @xcite , which give the number of stars around which a planet from the center of the grid cell would have been detected with a signal - to - noise ratio above @xmath18 .",
    "this should still give us nearly the same occurrence rate , or an underestimate of the actual value .",
    "this is because , as pointed by @xcite , the @xmath9 values calculated by @xcite and used in their estimate of @xmath4 are generally lower in value than the center of the grid cells values we use from figure 15 .",
    "if this is the general trend , i.e. , if we are overestimating @xmath9 systematically , then our calculated occurrence rates for m - dwarfs can be considered as a lower bound to the actual value .    in the case of occurrence rates for k & g - dwarfs , completeness correction factors from @xcite",
    "are available ( see figure   s11 , supplementary information ) .",
    "as mentioned above , they also provide @xmath17 stars .",
    "therefore , all the required values are available to calculate the occurrence rate using equation [ rateeq ] .",
    "we identify those planets that are in the appropriate period - radius bin from each data set .",
    "we consider planets with @xmath19r@xmath20 as terrestrial size , and count all the planets in the vz . restricting the outer edge of vz to the runaway greenhouse flux limit from @xcite for different stars , and the inner edge to the empirical relation between stellar flux and planetary gravity for venus from figure [ innerfig ] ( @xmath21 times incident flux on earth ) , there are 22 planets in the m - star sample of @xcite . with these conditions , using equation [ rateeq ] , the occurrence rate of terrestrial size planets that are potentially venus analogs around m - dwarfs is @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , there are @xmath22 planets in the k @xmath23 g - star sample of @xcite within the vz .",
    "the corresponding occurrence rate around k @xmath23 g - stars is @xmath3 .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated by ( 1 ) calculating the effective number of stars searched ( detected planets in the sample divided by the occurrence rate ) ( 2 ) constructing a binomial cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) representing the likelihood of finding specified number of planets given the effective number of stars searched and the probability of finding a planet ( i.e , occurrence rate ) , ( 3 ) finding the number of planets corresponding to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 percentiles in the cdf , ( 4 ) calculating the new occurrence rates by dividing the number of planets from percentile ranges with the effective number of stars searched and ( 5 ) finally subtracting these new rate bounds from the original rates . a list of all the planet candidates are provided in tables [ table1 ] @xmath23 [ table2 ] . a comparison of the various classifications of the candidates as described here is shown in the right panel of figure [ koihz ] .",
    "several caveats are to be noted : ( 1 ) none of these are confirmed planets , and are only candidates .",
    "in fact , a recent study by @xcite showed that two of the planet candidates ( koi  1422.02 and koi  2626.01 ) in the hz are larger than previous estimates . this may remove some planets out of contention and thus reduce the occurrence rate .",
    "the uncertainties in the stellar parameters and thus planetary radii are not well constrained , so this may also add to the uncertainty in our occurrence estimate @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite used the q1q6 sample .",
    "it is likely that an expanded dataset may increase the occurrence rate around m - dwarf stars .",
    "so the net effect may not change the rate estimate significantly .",
    "( 2 ) we use an upper flux limit of @xmath21 times earth flux .",
    "this number arises from figure [ innerfig ] , by finding the intersection point for venus on the `` cosmic shoreline '' ( the solid line ) .",
    "our terrestrial size planet has a radius range of @xmath19 r@xmath20 .",
    "correspondingly , the flux limit can vary depending on the size ( or gravity ) of the planet .",
    "this in turn changes the occurrence rate ( i.e , a planet with lower gravity has a lower flux limit , and hence a lower estimate of the occurrence rate ) .",
    "our estimates above are in this sense an average value that encompasses the terrestrial size planets .",
    "( 3 ) although we define an outer boundary of the vz , there are planetary properties that could push this out even further , such as sufficiently increased co@xmath26 levels that could push an atmosphere into runaway greenhouse even at larger distances .",
    "however , the probability of runaway greenhouse will start to drop dramatically with increasing distance beyond the vz .",
    "thus , our calculation of @xmath1 using the defined vz likely encompasses most venus analogs .",
    "( 4 ) just as planets in the hz should be considered `` earth - like candidates '' until their properties can be confirmed via spectroscopy , planets inside the vz should be considered `` venus - like candidates '' until spectral measurements and characterization efforts are undertaken .",
