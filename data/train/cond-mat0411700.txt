    "raman scattering in spin - ladders was studied in a number of papers ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the obtained experimental data was analyzed by several theoretical approaches @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . however in none of these papers the exact formula for the raman cross section was used . in the present paper",
    "we obtain the _ exact _",
    "formula for the special class of spin - ladder models with exact singlet - rung vacuum .",
    "this family of models was first suggested in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath0 has the following form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 here @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are spin-@xmath6 operators associated with cites of the ladder and @xmath7 is an identity matrix .",
    "the auxiliary term @xmath8 in ( 2 ) is need only for normalization to zero the lowest eigenvalue of the @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 of rung - rung interaction .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that when the following conditions @xmath11 are satisfied then the lowest ( zero eigenvalue ) eigenstate of @xmath10 is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the rung - singlet state . in this case",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) has the simple tensor - product form : @xmath14    in order to obtain the full spectrum of @xmath10 we shall also define the following triplet states : @xmath15    all other eigenstates of @xmath10 are separated into the following sectors : singlet @xmath16 , triplet @xmath17 , quintet @xmath18 with eigenvalues : @xmath19 , and two triplets @xmath20 with eigenvalues : @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1)-(3 ) commutes with the following magnon number operator @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the associated with the @xmath25-th rung projection operator on triplet states .",
    "corresponding to ( 1)-(4 ) one - magnon states were obtained in @xcite .",
    "suggesting the following bethe form for two - magnon states @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the total spin and @xmath28 the list of additional parameters ) : @xmath29 we obtain in standard way @xcite the following @xmath30 equation : @xmath31 } & \\nonumber\\\\ & + ( 2j_{\\bot}-3j_c)a_s(m , n;\\beta)=ea_s(m , n;\\beta),&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and bethe condition for amplitudes : @xmath32 here @xmath33 .    for each @xmath27 the eq .",
    "( 11 ) has two solutions .",
    "the scattering solution : @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and the bound solution : @xmath36 where the real parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfy the following condition : @xmath39 from ( 14 ) and nonnegativity of @xmath40 follows that @xmath41    the corresponding to ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) eigenvalues are : @xmath42    as we see from ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) the translation invariant states correspond to @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "following sugai @xcite we shall consider only the case when the incident and scattered light have parallel polarization directions both lying in the plane of the ladder and forming an angle @xmath46 with respect to vertical bonds ( rungs ) .",
    "the zero - temperature two - magnon raman scattering cross section as a function of frequency and @xmath46 can be expressed using fermi s golden rule @xcite,@xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of rungs . within the fleury - loudon - elliot approach the effective raman hamiltonian @xmath49 have the following form @xcite,@xcite ( we also take into account interactions across diagonals ) : @xmath50 here @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants and @xmath54 is the angle between rung and diagonal directions .",
    "operators @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the following : @xmath59    expressing @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath55 from the auxiliary operators : @xmath60 and taking into account the eq .",
    "( 6 ) we represent @xmath61 in the factorized form : @xmath62}^2i_0(\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath63    formula ( 22 ) expresses the polarization angle dependence of raman cross section however it may be applied in a straightforward way only for @xmath64 @xcite .    from the eq .",
    "( 6 ) , translational and @xmath65 invariance of @xmath66 follows that only translation invariant singlet two - magnon states contribute to the formula ( 23 ) . separating the contributions from scattering and bound states we obtain : @xmath67    from ( 12 ) and ( 13 )",
    "follows : @xmath68 we obtain from ( 26)-(29 ) the final expressions for the cross sections : @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the step function and @xmath71 is the rescaling parameter .    from ( 15 ) and ( 31 ) follows that the contribution from bound states @xmath72 exist only for @xmath73 . the behavior of @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 also essentially depends on the parameter @xmath76 . when @xmath77 the formula ( 30 ) reduces and the line - shape has a singularity at @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath79 it lies in the top of the two - magnon continuum however for @xmath80 in the bottom . for @xmath81",
    "the cross section @xmath82 is a regular function of @xmath75 and has the maximum in the point @xmath83 .    in order to study the line - shape in more detail we shall find its inflection points . calculating the second derivative of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath75 we",
    "obtain the following condition : @xmath84 since @xmath85 , the polynomial @xmath86 for @xmath81 has only 0 or 2 zeros in the interval @xmath87 . from standard calculation",
    "follows that @xmath86 has the maximum @xmath88 in the point @xmath89 .",
    "it is evident now that for @xmath90 the line - shape of @xmath82 has two inflection points .",
    "from the straightforward calculation follows that @xmath91 only for @xmath92 where @xmath93 ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) .",
    "it may be easily proved in a straightforward way that @xmath96 , so @xmath97 .    in the case ( 33 ) the line - shape near the @xmath98 is similar to van - hove singularity . for @xmath99",
    "this `` singularity '' lies near the top of the two - magnon continuum however for @xmath100 near the bottom . in both the cases",
    "the line - shape of raman scattering is strongly _",
    "asymmetric_. the case @xmath101 with no inflection points may be interpreted as a broad maximum .",
    "some line shapes corresponding to different values of @xmath102 are presented in the fig . 1 .",
    "as it follows from ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) for @xmath103 the top ( bottom ) of the two - magnon continuum and the bound two - magnon state have the same energy : @xmath104 . it was proposed in @xcite that in this case the resonance between bound and scattering states leads to a redistribution of raman intensity and merging of singularity .",
    "however as we see from ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) in our model this conjecture fails",
    ". moreover the singularity in @xmath82 appears only in the resonance @xmath77 cases .",
    "raman scattering in @xmath105 and @xmath106 were reported in @xcite .",
    "it was pointed that for both materials the corresponding line - shapes are strongly asymmetric and have one maximum instead of two .",
    "this fact was considered as strange and there were suggested some conjectures to interpret it . for example",
    "it was supposed in @xcite that in @xmath107 there is no spin - gap and the magnetic ordering is 2d , or the spin - gap is so small ( about 10 @xmath108 that can not be observed by the used experimental resolution .",
    "the asymmetry of the line - shape for @xmath109 was interpreted in @xcite as originating from next - nearest neighbor interactions . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that the second peak in the line - shape of @xmath109 is not observed because it is dominated by phonon peak . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that the asymmetry originates from resonance with two - triplet bound state .",
    "in our paper we have demonstrated that the line - shape asymmetry in spin - ladder raman scattering is not something strange and outstanding but may appear in a sufficiently big class of models .",
    "of course we do not pretend that for some values of exchange parameters our toy model necessary describes the real materials such as @xmath109 or @xmath105 .",
    "nevertheless perhaps the true ground state is in some sense `` close '' to our idealized one ( 5 ) and we may believe that our model correctly represents some general qualitative features of real materials . in this context",
    "we emphasize that the _ exactly calculated _",
    "raman scattering line - shape may be strongly asymmetric without any additional assumptions such as next - nearest neighbor interactions , resonance with bound state or dominating by phonon peak .",
