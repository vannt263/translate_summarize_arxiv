    "the dicke model  @xcite describes the interaction of a number ( @xmath5 ) of two - level atoms ( qubits ) with a single bosonic mode and has been a paradigmatic example of collective quantum behavior .",
    "it is closely related to many fields in quantum optics , quantum information science , and condensed matter physics . the superradiant behavior by an ensemble of quantum dots  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , and coupled arrays of optical cavities has been used to simulate the strongly correlated systems  @xcite .",
    "quantum integrability is an often - mentioned concept in the description of a quantum system , however it is not well defined to date  @xcite , in sharp contrast with the classical integrability , mostly due to the markedly different ways to count the degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) in the quantum and classical mechanics .",
    "this situation becomes more serious for the dicke model , where the classical limit is lacking because of the quantum nature of the finite number of levels , one can not define integrability from any classical limit . in the semi - classical limit , where the boson mode is treated as a classical field",
    "while the discrete level is kept as a quantum entity , the signatures of chaos emerge in the dicke model  @xcite , even in the rabi model ( single qubit )  @xcite .",
    "one appealing way to address the quantum integrability is looking at the energy level statistics .",
    "the corresponding berry - tabor criterion  @xcite states that a quantum system is integrable if the level statistics is possionian .",
    "however it relies on the semiclassical arguments and only concerns quantum systems with continuous d.o.f .",
    "the level statistics of the finite but large @xmath6 dicke model is shown to be possionian below and wigner - dyson above the critical coupling  @xcite . while the level statistics of rabi model is neither poissonian nor wigner  @xcite , which is characteristics of genuinely integrable models .",
    "recently , braak proposed that if the eigenstates of a quantum system can be uniquely labeled by @xmath7 quantum numbers , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the numbers of the discrete and continuous d.o.f , then it is integrable  @xcite . by this novel criterion , the @xmath10 dicke model is non - integrable  @xcite , while the rabi model is integrable@xcite .",
    "implications of the ( non)-integrability in the dicke model with arbitrary number of qubits should be generally interesting .    despite the simplicity of the full dicke model ,",
    "its solution is however highly non - trivial .",
    "many approaches have been developed and extended to the this model  @xcite . among them , the exact eigensolutions in the finite @xmath6 dicke model are very crucial to get some deep insights , but they are mainly limited to numerical diagonalization in truncated bosonic fock space  @xcite . recently , chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have presented numerical exact solutions to this model using extended coherent states ( ecs )  @xcite , where the truncation of the hilbert space can be alleviated systematically .",
    "it has been extensively shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that as compared with the photonic number ( fock ) basis , ecs is exhibited to be valid for a large region of the hamiltonian parameter space by analyzing the converged energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "more recently , an analytical exact solution , which is mathematically well defined , to the rabi model  @xcite has been discovered by braak  @xcite using the representation of bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the bargmann space of analytical functions  @xcite .",
    "a so - called @xmath3-function with a single energy variable was derived yielding exact eigensolutions . alternatively , using ecs , this @xmath3-function was recovered in a simpler , yet physically more transparent manner by chen _",
    "et al . _",
    "the continuous extensions to the analytical treatments for the dick - type model with less than @xmath11 qubits have also achieved progress  @xcite . among them , complicated @xmath12 determinant @xmath3-functions were derived in the bargmann representation for the @xmath10 dicke model  @xcite . by using the ecs , @xmath3-function resembling the most simple one without a determinant in the rabi model was given for the @xmath13 dicke model  @xcite and @xmath14 determinant @xmath3-function was derived in the rabi model with two arbitrary qubits  @xcite . a generally concise analytic solutions to the dicke model of arbitrary number of qubits , which is a counterpart to the previous numerical exact solution  @xcite , should be highly called for .    on the other hand , quantum correlations among qubits , viewed as quantum information resources ,",
    "have also attracted extensive interest .",
    "a dozen qubits are sufficient in the applications to quantum information technology .",
    "however , only bipartite quantum correlations have been studied in the dicke model  @xcite , and multi - partite quantum correlations have not been explored , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the multi - partite quantum correlations can be used to implement operations in the measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite and high - precision metrology  @xcite , thus is most important from the experimental viewpoint .",
    "however , it was difficult to characterize multi - partite quantum correlations in many previous efforts   @xcite .",
    "recently , the theory of multipartite entanglement has been achieved much progress , especially the computable entanglement monotone  @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "multi - qubits have been constructed in several solid devices recently , such as the well - known greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states  @xcite of more than two qubits using the complete circuit and full set of gates  @xcite .",
    "the path to scalability is prerequisite to realize the quantum computation and quantum information processes .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we demonstrate a successful derivation of a concise @xmath3-function for the arbitrary @xmath6 dicke model for by means of ecs  @xcite . for @xmath15 or @xmath16 ,",
    "the @xmath3-function is a @xmath17 determinant , which are very feasible to calculate all eigensolutions for the dicke model with a dozen qubits .",
    "the non - integrability of the finite @xmath6 dicke model is then discussed in terms of the level distribution dictated by the @xmath3-functions .",
    "second , using the exact eigensolutions , we study the dynamics of the genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) from the maximum entangled states , such as bell states for @xmath13 and ghz states for @xmath10 and @xmath18 .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "2 , we introduce the model hamiltonian and briefly review the previous numerical exact techniques based on the ecs .",
    "section 3 describes the detailed analytic scheme for the solutions to the finite @xmath6 dicke model .",
    "the @xmath3-functions are derived explicitly . in sec . 4",
    ", we illustrate that the exact spectra can be easily obtained by the stable zeros of the @xmath3-function and discuss the implications of the present derivation with the non - integrability of the finite @xmath6 dick model . as an example of the applications of the present method , the exact dynamics of the gme of the dicke model",
    "is studied using the obtained exact eigensolutions in sec .",
    "a summary is given in the final section .",
    "the hamiltonian of the finite @xmath6 dicke model can be written as ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the qubit splitting , @xmath22 creates one photon in the common single - mode cavity with frequency @xmath23 , @xmath24 describes the atom - cavity coupling strength , ( we usually denote@xmath25 ) , and @xmath26where@xmath27 @xmath28 is the pauli operator of the @xmath29-th qubit , @xmath30 is the usual angular momentum operator , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the angular raising and lowing operators and obey the @xmath33 lie algebra @xmath34=2j_z,[j_z , j_{\\pm } ] = \\pm j_{\\pm } $ ] .",
    "this hamiltonian posses a @xmath35-symmetry like the rabi model and exhibits a second - order quantum phase transition at @xmath36 in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by the dicke state @xmath37 , which is the eigenstate of @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the eigenvalues @xmath40 and @xmath41 . throughout this paper ,",
    "the unit is taken of @xmath42 .",
    "previously , we have proposed a numerical exact approach for dicke model of arbitrary @xmath6 by ecs  @xcite .",
    "the wave function is described in the basis @xmath43 where the photonic state is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the photonic vacuum state , @xmath46and @xmath47 is the truncated bosonic number in the fock space of the new operator @xmath48 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath49 can be determined through the exact lanczos diagonalization . in that work ,",
    "we have solved the dicke model for more than one thousand qubits numerically , and obtained some critical exponents with high accuracy .",
    "it was numerically shown later that increasing the number of atoms imposes a strong limit to the states in the fock basis , but not in the ecs scheme  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the similar or same ansatz for the wavefunction like ( [ wavefunction ] ) have been used in many recent works for the dick - type models .    in the next section",
    ", we will propose an analytic scheme to the exact solution for the finite @xmath6 dicke model .",
    "we will demonstrate that the @xmath15 and @xmath0 dicke models can be treated in an unified way . in the matrix form of the dicke state basis",
    ", the hamiltonian takes a tridiagonal type .",
    "the diagonal element is @xmath50 . while two typical off - diagonal elements are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the kronecker delta .",
    "we introduce @xmath2 pairs of displaced operators as @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath6 even case is excluded here , because it is just the original photonic operators without displacement and will be independently treated later . by @xmath57 ,",
    "the diagonal element @xmath58 becomes @xmath59 specially , the diagonal element @xmath60 for @xmath61 can be transformed into the form with free particle number operators .",
    "then we propose the wavefunction in fock space of @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 are coefficients and @xmath65 are the number states in @xmath66 .",
    "the latter is just called as ecs  @xcite with the following property @xmath67 where the vacuum state @xmath68 is the eigenstate of the one - photon annihilation operator @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath70 .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under the transformations @xmath79and @xmath80 , due to the associated conserved parity .",
    "so the wavefunction in the series expansion in @xmath81 should take @xmath82 should be proportional to @xmath83 . comparing the dicke states @xmath84 and @xmath85 gives @xmath86 left multiplying @xmath87 and with the use of @xmath88 ,",

    "for the most simple rabi model , we only have one linear equation with either parity , and the relevant coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be determined recursively from the initial value @xmath93",
    "@xcite , because eqs .",

    "( [ exceptional ] ) and the corresponding energy levels in the spectral graph . generally , @xmath125 , owing to the different parity dependent conditions .",

    "it should be stressed here that the level crossing in two parity subspace does not occur at an exceptional eigenvalue , and therefore the doubly degenerate state at the level crossing has the regular spectrum with fixed parity for the @xmath5 dicke model , in sharp contrast with the rabi model .",

    "they do not belong to the true eigenvalues and can be excluded very easily .",

    ", we find that at the same coupling strength ( @xmath224 ) between the single - mode cavity and the individual qubit , the gme for more qubits are more stronger , which will be an advantage if gme for more qubits act as the resource in the quantum information processing .",

    "we argue that the poissonian statistics at the weak coupling observed in literature is the consequence of rather many very small avoided crossings than many true level crossings .",
