    "bipartite and multipartite entanglement is one of the features that give rise to many of the developments of quantum computation and information , like quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite , among others @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the entanglement of a composite state is thus a main task to be done . for this purpose ,",
    "the schmidt decomposition @xcite has proven to be a valuable tool , for systems with just two components .",
    "in this paper we consider the case of continuous variables entanglement . for us , these variables may be @xmath0 which commute as phase space variables do .",
    "we also refer to continuous variable entanglement in systems described by momentum and/or energy observables .",
    "precisely , the entanglement of continuous variables stems from the original epr article @xcite .",
    "however , the treatment of systems with continuous variables is far from straightforward . until now ,",
    "schmidt decomposition in the continuous case required solving the corresponding integral equations @xcite .",
    "they had to be discretized , losing the continuous dependence of the initial state . here",
    "we propose a method to perform the schmidt decomposition for this case , to the accuracy desired , keeping the continuous character of the variables .",
    "this method consists of two steps :    \\1 ) we decompose the bipartite system wave function , @xmath1 , by using two discrete and complete sets of orthogonal functions , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , of @xmath4 , in the form :    @xmath5    the purpose of this step is to transform the continuous problem into a discrete one ( a necessary step for the numerical computation ) , while preserving the continuous dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "\\2 ) then we apply the ( finite dimensional ) schmidt procedure to ( [ eq11 ] ) in order to write the wave function @xmath1 as diagonal sum of biorthogonal terms :    @xmath6    the orthogonal functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 -the modes- will be some particular linear combinations of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , respectively . notice that we are using the schmidt procedure for discrete systems to obtain the decomposition for the continuous case .",
    "this is much more tractable , as it implies diagonalizing matrices instead of solving integral equations .",
    "the rationale for this procedure is the expectation that only a few @xmath11 will suffice : a handful of appropriate orthogonal functions will approximate @xmath1 to the desired accuracy .",
    "we finish by pointing out some properties of this method , namely    \\a ) we obtain complete analytic characterization of the modes @xmath7 , @xmath8 to the desired precision .",
    "our method surpasses the standard numerical procedures in that keeps the continuous features present in @xmath1 .",
    "\\b ) we remark the portability of the attained modes @xmath7 , @xmath8 that are ready for later uses .",
    "\\c ) for the physical system analyzed in this paper ( biphoton ) , we found that with @xmath12 @xmath13 matrices the error was of around @xmath14 , that is , the number of @xmath11 functions required is small .",
    "for other systems studied that we do not include here , the convergence was even better : for the case of two electrons which interact electrostatically , the obtained error with @xmath15 matrices was of @xmath16 ( schmidt number @xmath17 ) .    in this paper",
    "we begin with a detailed exposition of our method in sect .",
    "then , in sect",
    ". [ s4 ] we apply it to a relevant case : the entanglement of two photons created by parametric down - conversion .",
    "we compare our results ( leading to well known , continuous functions ) with those computed by numerical methods @xcite that produce sets of points : discrete functions .",
    "both methods agree remarkably well . finally , in sect .",
    "[ delta ] we decompose the dirac delta , a case of physical and mathematical interest .",
    "we consider a bipartite quantum system formed by two subsystems @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "some examples are two photons entangled by parametric down - conversion , a photon emitted by an excited atom and as a result entangled with it or two charged particles which interact electrically .",
    "this system is described by the vector state    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the creation operators of a particle associated to the subsystems @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are continuous variables associated to @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , which can represent momenta , energies , frequencies , or the like . in general",
    ", the analysis is made in an ad hoc kinematical situation in which @xmath23 and @xmath24 turn out to be one - dimensional variables , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . in the following we assume this is the case .",
    "in addition , there can be discrete variables ( like the spin ) to be treated with the schmidt method , that we do not include here to avoid unwieldy notation .",
    "our method works as follows :    we consider two denumerable , complete sets of orthogonal @xmath4 functions @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath27 , each one associated to each particular subsystem @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these functions obey    @xmath30    \\1 ) our first step is to expand the wave function @xmath1 as a linear combination of the @xmath31 , translating the continuous problem into a discretized one .",
    "thus we work with the discrete coefficients of the linear combination , though the continuous character of the state is preserved in the @xmath32 dependence of the @xmath31 functions .",
    "the expansion reads :    @xmath33    where the coefficients @xmath13 are given by    @xmath34    \\2 ) our second step is to apply the schmidt decomposition to the discretized bipartite state ( [ eq24 ] ) , as is usually done for finite dimension hilbert spaces ( diagonalizing matrices , instead of solving integral equations ) . in order to do this ,",
    "it is necessary to truncate the expansion ( [ eq24 ] ) , something that is possible to a certain accuracy due to the fact that latexmath:[$\\int dp dq    and the expansion is in orthogonal functions , so the coefficients @xmath13 go to 0 with increasing @xmath36 ( see below ) .",
    "we truncate the series ( [ eq24 ] ) at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , without loss of generality .",
    "the schmidt procedure leads to ( [ eq12 ] ) , where    @xmath40    here the matrix @xmath41 is the ( transposed ) eigenvectors matrix of @xmath42 :    @xmath43    and @xmath44 are the eigenvalues of @xmath45 .",
    "there are two sources of error in this procedure :    \\a ) truncation error : this is the largest source of error in our method .",
    "inescapably , the series ( [ eq24 ] ) must end at some finite @xmath46 , @xmath47 when attempting to obtain some specific result .",
    "this step is possible to a certain accuracy because the function @xmath1 is square - integrable and we are expanding it into orthogonal functions , so @xmath48 and thus @xmath49 when @xmath50 .",
    "the particular choice of the orthogonal functions @xmath51 will affect how fast the @xmath13 go to zero .",
    "hence , the election of these functions for a particular physical problem will be a delicate task . to reach the same accuracy with different sets @xmath52 it will be necessary in general to consider a different pair of cut - offs @xmath53 for each of the sets .",
    "b ) numerical error : this is a better controlled source .",
    "it includes the error in calculating the coefficients @xmath13 via ( [ eq25 ] ) and the one produced when diagonalizing the matrix @xmath54 .",
    "the suitable quantity to control the convergence for a particular @xmath1 and a specific set @xmath52 is the well known ( squared ) distance @xmath55 between the function @xmath1 and the schmidt decomposition obtained with cut - offs @xmath53 ( mean square error ) :    @xmath56    this expression gives the truncation error .",
    "it will go to zero with increasing cut - offs according to the specific @xmath52 chosen .",
    "another easily computable , less precise way of controlling the convergence is given by the fact that ( with no cut - offs ) @xmath57 and thus    @xmath58    is other measure of the truncation error , where here @xmath59 is calculated with cut - offs @xmath53 .",
    "would we compute the @xmath60 exactly , then @xmath61 . in practice this can not be done because our @xmath60 are the eigenvalues of the @xmath62 matrix @xmath63 , that depend slightly on @xmath64 .",
    "both distances behave in a very similar way , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig1bis ] , though @xmath65 is more easily computable than @xmath66 .",
    "the election of the two sets of orthogonal functions for a particular physical problem , @xmath67 can be approached from two different points of view , according to the feature one desires to emphasize : fundamental or practical .",
    "the election of the orthogonal functions in a particular problem can be done according to the specific intervals in which the variables @xmath68 take values for that case .",
    "typical examples of discrete sets of orthogonal functions are the orthogonal polynomials , defined in a variety of intervals . for example , a possible choice to describe one dimensional momenta @xmath69 , are the hermite polynomials , @xmath70 .",
    "the equivalence sign indicates here that the polynomial must be accompanied by the square root of the weight function in order to be correctly orthonormalized , and normalization factors must be included .",
    "if , on the other hand , the variable of interest in a specific problem is bounded from below , like the energy of a free massless particle @xmath71 , then the election could be laguerre polynomials , @xmath72 .",
    "the criterion for choosing the orthogonal functions @xmath51 according to the intervals in which @xmath23 , @xmath24 are defined has a fundamental character .",
    "for example , the localizability in configuration space of the fourier transforms of the modes ( [ eq26 ] ) , ( [ eq27 ] ) , depends critically on the intervals in which these modes are defined @xcite .",
    "only if we choose the functions @xmath51 to be defined exactly in the same intervals as the amplitude @xmath1 , may the fourier transforms of the modes have the right localization properties . in spite of that , this point of view may not be the most suitable one , as it may give slower convergence than the point of view presented below .      in this case ,",
    "the election is approached with the goal of improving the convergence .",
    "the @xmath51 are chosen here according to the functional form of @xmath1 .",
    "the closer the lowest modes are to @xmath73 the lesser the number of them necessary to obtain the required accuracy .",
    "what we are looking for here are @xmath51 that maximize @xmath74 for low @xmath46 , @xmath47 .    in some cases",
    "this practical point of view will be more useful than the fundamental one .",
    "for example , suppose the amplitude for a particular problem is of the form @xmath75 , with @xmath76 a slowly varying function of @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "in this particular case it is reasonable to choose the functions @xmath51 as hermite polynomials , because their weight functions are indeed gaussians .",
    "this leads to @xmath77 , and similarly for @xmath10 .",
    "we call this approach practical because the convergence is reached faster",
    ". there is a price : the information relevant to localization might be lost .",
    "in this section we consider a realistic case of biphotons already studied in the literature @xcite : two photons entangled in frequency through parametric down - conversion .",
    "we apply our method to this physical system in order to obtain the schmidt decomposition and the structure of modes without losing the analytic character within the target accuracy .",
    "the system under study is a biphoton state generated by parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) of an ultrashort pump pulse with type - ii phase matching .",
    "the amplitude in this particular case takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath78\\nonumber\\\\\\times \\mathrm{sinc}\\{l[(\\omega_o-\\bar{\\omega } ) ( k'_o-\\bar{k})+(\\omega_e-\\bar{\\omega})(k'_e-\\bar{k})]/2\\}\\label{eq41}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 are the frequencies associated to the ordinary and extraordinary fields respectively , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the inverse of group velocities at the frequency @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the inverse group velocity at the pump frequency @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the pdc crystal length and @xmath86 is the width of the initial pulse .",

    "these polynomials were used in @xcite for pdc in some particular cases which are exactly solvable .",

    "we did a careful analysis of this , that for brevity we do not show here . notice that our conclusions would not apply in the case @xmath99 .",

    "in fact , the parity and number of nodes is determined by them , taking into account that @xmath111 is a polynomial of degree @xmath47 , parity @xmath112 and having @xmath47 nodes .",
    "a good approximation to the @xmath113 obtained with our procedure is    @xmath114    this expression has a deviation ( squared distance ) of @xmath115 from the whole mode obtained including terms until @xmath116 , which is the greatest power appearing for @xmath102 . on the other hand , @xmath117 . from ( [ eq410 ] )",
    "it can be seen that in this mode the even components are greater than the odd ones ( these are negligible ) , so it is an even state , as shown in fig .",

    "we chose another type of orthogonal function for ( [ eq46 ] ) ( laguerre , legendre , ... ) , the convergence would have been much worse because of the specific shape of that amplitude .",
    "another interesting case is the dirac delta .",
    "here we have @xmath128 and we take the same interval @xmath129 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "we obtain straightforwardly @xmath131 .",
    "this gives    @xmath132    which is just the resolution of the identity as given in ( [ eq23 ] ) .",

    "this expression can be seen as an infinite entanglement case , in the sense explained below .",
    "the fact that all the weights are equal to one , makes sense only because we are considering a distribution , not an @xmath4 state .",
    "the sum of the squares of the weights , which must be equal to the square of the norm of the function @xmath1 , diverges because the dirac delta is not square - integrable .    a possible measure of the entanglement of a state @xmath1 in its schmidt decomposition ( [ eq12 ] ) is given by the von neumann entropy @xcite    @xmath134    this is usually called the entropy of entanglement .    the state of @xmath4 closer to ( [ eq33 ] ) is the case of an entangled state with @xmath135 diagonal terms with equal @xmath60 , when @xmath135 goes to infinity .",
    "to be correctly normalized it verifies @xmath136 , @xmath137 and    @xmath138    this is the maximum entanglement case .",
    "this provides an estimate of the entropy of the dirac delta ( were it in @xmath4 ) .",
    "the origin of our interest in the @xmath139 comes from the fact that @xmath1 may evolve in time towards a dirac delta , as it happens in time dependent perturbation theory of quantum mechanics .",
    "the entanglement in these cases would increase with time towards its maximum , corresponding to the dirac delta .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a method for computing the schmidt decomposition of a bipartite state with continuous degrees of freedom . in the existing literature",
    "@xcite the decomposition produced sets of points as approximation to the modes .",
    "our method gives linear combinations of the well known orthogonal functions as approximation to them .",
    "when these functions are chosen properly , a handful of them is enough to reach the desired accuracy .",
    "we introduce some criteria for the control of convergence and truncation error .",
    "the result of our method for the decomposition of a biphoton state produced by parametric down - conversion agrees with the numeric results in the literature @xcite .",
