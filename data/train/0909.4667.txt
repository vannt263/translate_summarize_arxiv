    "the design of a neutrino factory has been put forward and discussed in international studies , such as in refs .",
    "especially the most recent study , the international scoping study of a future neutrino factory and super - beam facility  @xcite , has laid the foundations for the currently ongoing design study for the neutrino factory ( ids - nf )  @xcite .",
    "this initiative from about 2007 to 2012 is aiming to present a design report , schedule , cost estimate , and risk assessment for a neutrino factory .",
    "it defines a baseline setup of a high energy neutrino factory with two baselines @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the `` magic '' baseline ) operated by two racetrack - shaped storage rings , where the muon energy is 25  gev ( for optimization questions , see refs .",
    "there are no near detector ( nd ) specifications yet , and the systematics treatment is done in an effective way by signal and background normalization errors uncorrelated among all channels and detectors",
    ". therefore , there are a number of questions currently raised within the ids - nf :    * study of the potential of near detectors to cancel systematical errors .",
    "* study of the characteristics of the near detectors , such as technology , number , _",
    "etc._. * study of the use of the near detectors for searches of new physics .    for the near detectors at a neutrino factory",
    ", a summary of options can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the work",
    "@xcite , a more refined systematics treatment including cross section errors , flux errors , and background uncertainties is simulated to address several of these questions by globes ref .",
    "both the physics results of the high energy neutrino factory for standard oscillations and also sensitivities of nonstandard interactions are presented .",
    "geometry of the muon storage ring and possible near detector ( nd ) locations ( not to scale ) .",
    "the baseline @xmath2 is the distance between production point and near detector , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3",
    ". this figure is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    at first , we consider the geometry of the storage ring and possbile near detector locations as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] where @xmath4 is the length of the decay straight , @xmath5 is the distance from the nearest point in the decay straight to the detector and the baseline @xmath2 is the distance between the production point and the near detector . then we could define limiting cases in terms of geometry .",
    "+ in this case , the neutrino beam divergence is smaller than the detector diameter for the farthest decay point of the decay straight @xmath6 , _ i.e. _ , the full flux ( integrated over the angle ) is seen by the detector from any decay point in the straight .",
    "+ in this case , the beam diameter given by the opening angle applied to the size of detector is of the order of the detector diameter at the nearest decay point @xmath7 , where the near detector takes effects as a far detector for any decay point in the straight .",
    ".[tab : nd ] definition of near detectors . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     because there are no tau neutrinos in the beam , the most interesting option may be to use near detectors to measure @xmath8 appearance , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the high energy neutrino factory with nd3 and two ( symmetrically operated ) additional 2  kt opera - like emulsion cloud chambers ( ecc ) as simulated in ref .",
    "@xcite and described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath9 channel at the neutrino factory , and operate them at @xmath10 corresponding to nd5 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : ring ] ) .",
    "the nomad limits for the zero - distance effect could be improved by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , if it is possibe that source and matter nsi are connected at a generic level assuming dimension six effective operators generated at the tree level by messagers from a high energy scale  @xcite , even the matter nsi parameter @xmath11 becomes quite strongly limited , exceeding the bound from lepton universality .",
    "furthermore , cp violation from matter nsi may become measurable down to 0.0005 in @xmath11 .",
    "we have included the geometry of the source and the detectors in the event rate calculations in the definitions of qualitatively different near detectors .",
    "in addition , we have refined the systematics treatment including cross section errors , flux normalization errors and background uncertainties . for the characteristics of the near detectors for standard oscillation measurements",
    ", we have found that two near detectors should be operated on - axis ( with respect to the decay straights ) if the muons and anti - muons circulate in different directions in a racetrack - shaped ring .",
    "if the neutrino factory has only one baseline , such as a high energy ( @xmath12 ) neutrino factory with @xmath13 , the near detectors are mandatory for the leading atmospheric parameter measurements . for the @xmath14 and",
    "mass hierarchy discovery reaches , we have not found any significant impact , because these measurements are background limited .",
    "for the cp violation discovery reach , the near detectors are important , because the unknown atmospheric parameters lead to intrinsic unknown backgrounds from the cp - even terms , which can be controlled by the near detectors .",
    "for a two baseline high energy neutrino factory , such as the ids - nf baseline setup with @xmath15 combined with @xmath16 , we have demonstrated that the considered systematical errors cancel even without near detectors and good flux monitoring . finally , we have considered opera - like near detectors for @xmath8 appearance to measure non - standard interactions ( nsi ) .",
    "we have demonstrated the nomad limits for the zero - distance effect could be improved by about two orders of magnitude . in a word ,",
    "two near detectors are mandatory for a successful neutrino factory operation with one baseline , and a good enough flux monitoring will be useful for some physics measurements . however , a two baseline high energy neutrino factory may prove to be very robust with respect to systematical errors , even if the systematics goals in the initial one baseline operation phase can not be achieved .",
