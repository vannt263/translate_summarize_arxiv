    "i am measuring the equivalent widths of emission lines in the @xmath0600 galaxies from the sample of cohen _ et al . _  ( 2000 ) and cohen ( 2001 ) in the region of the hdf - north with @xmath1 .",
    "this redshift survey , based on spectra from lris at the keck observatory , is more than 93% complete for @xmath2 in the hdf itself and for @xmath3 in the flanking fields , comprising a circle 8 arcmin in diameter centered on the hdf .",
    "while all the measurements are carried out automatically with a script , they must be checked by hand .",
    "so far i ve completed checking the results for 254 galaxies , all with spectra taken by me .",
    "the analysis of these emission line strengths is in progress .",
    "equivalent widths have been measured both using a feature and blue and red continua bandpasses defined in the rest frame as well as using gaussian fitting .",
    "we adopt the emitted luminosity in the 3727   line of [ oii ] as our primary indicator of the star formation rate because of the wider redshift range over which it can be detected , given that at present we are restricted only to optical spectra for galaxies in our sample .",
    "all luminosities are given in the rest frame , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the sed formalism of cohen ( 2001 ) is used to derive all continuum luminosities .",
    "emission line luminosities are calculated using the measured equivalent width and the inferred continuum luminosity deduced from broad band large aperture photometry .",
    "we are thus assuming that the 1 arc - sec wide slit passes a reasonable sample of the total galaxy light , i.e. that emission is not concentrated just in the region of the galactic nucleus .",
    "as an example of the analyses that can be carried out with this data , figure 1 shows @xmath4 ( luminosity of the [ oii ] emission line in the rest frame ) as a function of redshift .",
    "an arrow indicates the luminosity in this emission line corresponding to a sfr of 100 @xmath5/yr . the mean local star formation rate for emission line galaxies from the universidad complutense de madrid survey ( gil de paz _ et al .",
    "2000 ) is indicated as well .",
    "these local sfr measures include reddening corrections , while our data do not .",
    "the effect of a reddening correction corresponding to the mean adopted @xmath6 of 0.5 mag is indicated on the figure . adopting this value as a typical reddening",
    ", we find sfr rates among the galaxies in this distant sample which cover approximately the same range as in local samples of emission line galaxies .    in figure 2",
    "we show the star formation rate per unit mass ( sfr/_m _ ) for these 254 galaxies .",
    "this parameter is an indicator of the current sfr divided by the mean sfr over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "we use the rest frame luminosity emitted in the 3727 emission line divided by the rest frame luminosity at @xmath7 as a measure of the specific sfr .",
    "the former is dominated by emission from the youngest stars in a galaxy , with high luminosity per unit mass , while the latter is dominated by the light from any older population that may be present , and is much less affected by the possible presence of luminous young stars .    the specific star formation rate parameter is plotted as a function of redshift . as suggested by guzman _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) based on a much smaller sample of galaxies , the upper bound of the specific sfr is independent of redshift .    however , the luminosity of those galaxies with the highest specific sfr increases with redshift . at the present epoch ,",
    "high specific sfr is associated primarily with low luminosity ( presumably low mass ) galaxies , but at @xmath8 , the most luminous galaxies show this high specific sfr .    to summarize the results we have found thus far , our data in the hdf demonstrate that star formation in distant galaxies is quite similar to that in the local universe .",
    "the range of equivalent widths of the most common diagnostic lines is similar over the full range of redshift probed here , @xmath9 .",
    "we define the specific sfr as the star formation rate per unit luminosity ( equivalent to sfr per unit mass for a constant @xmath10 ratio , a reasonable approximation for luminosity at rest frame @xmath7 ) .",
    "this ratio is effectively the current sfr divided by the mean sfr over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "the maximum specific sfr over the full range of redshift probed here is similar to that of local star forming galaxies .",
    "however , the most massive galaxies seen at @xmath11 are forming stars at this rate while locally , high specific star formation rates are seen mostly in low mass galaxies .",
    "it appears that the high specific sfr seen in galaxies at @xmath11 is associated with a mode of star formation in which the whole galaxy , not just the nucleus or a few isolated hii regions , participates ."
