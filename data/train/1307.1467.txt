    ", the mw clouds and the extragalactic data seem to exhibit a much tighter correlation , which is shown in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](a ) . kdm12 only included the c2d+gb clouds from h10 and the l10 clouds at the two different extinction thresholds , while here we add all data from h10 , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we take the total mass in gas and the total mass in sink particles above a given @xmath29 threshold and divide both by the cloud area that is above that extinction threshold to measure @xmath1 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "finally , we compute @xmath31 for class ii ysos , routinely applied by observers @xcite , such that our procedure to place the simulation data in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](b ) matches the observational method as closely as possible .",
    "note that this procedure does not necessarily reflect the true rate of star formation in the simulations ( studied in detail in fk12 ) , but places the simulation data as they would be placed if processed by an observer , who does not have any information about the time evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](b ) shows that the simulations are consistent with the observations and roughly agree with the l10 clouds measured at the same extinction threshold , @xmath4 .",
    "comparing the simulations with one another , we arrive at three conclusions .",
    "first , for a fixed mach number , the simulations with compressive driving exhibit higher @xmath2 and @xmath0 than the respective simulations with mixed and solenoidal driving .",
    "secondly , @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath32 , while @xmath0 stays almost constant .",
    "thirdly , magnetic fields reduce @xmath2 , but only very marginally .    evaluating the same simulations as in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](b ) not only at @xmath4 , but at a range of extinction thresholds ,",
    ", we obtain the distribution of simulation data shown in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](c ) .",
    "we find that the roughly linear proportionality between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is primarily driven by changes in the extinction value defining the clouds .",
    "this was already seen when we compared the l10 clouds at @xmath3 and @xmath4 in panel ( a ) .",
    "the only difference is that the simulation data do not have the dynamic range ( because of limited numerical resolution ) to reach down to the very low extinction values in the l10 clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](c ) confirms the effect of increasing sonic mach number seen in panel ( b ) , i.e.  clouds with higher @xmath32 shift to lower @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath1 is almost fixed for a given @xmath29 threshold , but @xmath33 varies with cloud size @xmath34 and mach number ( which is why clouds with mach 50 have about @xmath35 lower @xmath2 than mach 5 clouds in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm]b ) as the simulations roughly follow the @xcite relations for the velocity dispersion and density as a function of cloud size ( see fk12 , table  2 ) . a substantial fraction of the observed scatter in @xmath2",
    "may thus be explained by variations in the turbulent mach number .",
    "if the clouds that form stars actually follow the larson relations in the same way as the simulations do here , then we may relate the observational data directly to the simulation data .",
    "however , some regions do not follow the standard larson relations ( e.g.  the central molecular zone ( cmz ) ; see * ? ? ? * and potentially also extragalactic systems ) , such that those regions will probably not be consistent with the simulations .",
    "however , the scatter seen in the observations may still be attributable to variations in the larson relations .",
    "to substantiate this finding , we add theoretical model curves in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](d ) .",
    "these models are based on the statistics of supersonic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in self - gravitating systems @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the best - fitting multi - freefall pn model in fk12 and compute @xmath36 where @xmath37 , i.e.  the product of gas density @xmath38 and size @xmath34 of the cloud structure . equation  ( [ eq : sigsfr ] ) is the same as equation  ( [ eq : kdm ] ) , but instead of a constant proportionality factor @xmath17 , we evaluate the dimensionless function @xmath39.\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eq : epssf ] ) is derived from an integral over the high - density tail of the log - normal probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the turbulent gas density @xcite @xcite , at which point star formation typically shuts off due to feedback processes .",
    "we thus conclude that a log - normal pdf is a reasonably good approximation for a simple theoretical model of the sfr , even when the density structure comes from a mixture of turbulence , gravitational instabilities , feedback , or cooling and heating processes @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath40 expressed in terms of the logarithmic density , , where @xmath41 is the mean density and @xmath42 is the logarithmic mean density .",
    "this integral is weighted by @xmath43 to estimate the mass fraction of gas above a critical density @xmath44 and weighted by a freefall - time factor to construct a dimensionless sfr : @xmath45 note that the factor @xmath46 is evaluated _ inside _ the integral because gas with different densities has different freefall times @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath17 is the same as in equation  ( [ eq : kdm ] ) , and @xmath47 @xcite accounts for the uncertainty in the timescale factor , which was measured to @xmath48 in fk12 .    the variables @xmath49 and @xmath44 in equation  ( [ eq : epssf ] ) are the standard deviation of the density pdf @xcite , @xmath50 $ ] , and the critical density @xcite , @xmath51}$ ] with @xmath52 and the virial parameter @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath54 was measured in fk12 and physically motivated in @xcite .",
    "combining all this yields @xmath55 , i.e.  a dimensionless sfr as a function of four basic cloud parameters : @xmath56 , @xmath32 , the turbulent driving parameter @xmath57 @xcite , and the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure , @xmath58 .",
    "since we concluded from the simulations above that magnetic fields only have a relatively weak effect ( with very strong magnetic fields , the sfr is reduced by a factor of 23 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* fk12 ) , for simplicity we only consider theoretical cases without magnetic fields in the following ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "although there is no doubt that magnetic fields modify the picture , they are unlikely the primary controller of the order - of - magnitude variations that we see in the observations . for the same reason , we only consider a fixed , intermediate turbulent driving parameter @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we further use the total efficiency @xmath15 as before .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](d ) shows equation  ( [ eq : sigsfr ] ) evaluated for four cloud sizes @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath19 , according to the velocity dispersion ",
    "size relation @xcite , @xmath68 with @xmath69 , typical for molecular gas with temperatures of about and standard solar composition @xcite .",
    "we also note in this context that @xcite and @xcite find that the sfr depends slightly on metallicity , introducing changes by a factor of 23 , so the order - of - magnitude variations seen in observations can not be explained by metallicity effects alone , but they may contribute .    in order to cover the range of @xmath29 and @xmath2 in the observations , we vary the density along each theoretical model curve as a free parameter . using the density  size relation @xcite @xmath70 with a typical density scale @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the atomic mass of hydrogen ) , similar to the simulated clouds in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](b ) and similar to the l10 clouds for @xmath4",
    ", we obtain the filled diamonds in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](d ) , which agree well with the computer models for that extinction threshold .",
    "we also add the open diamonds , representing the same theoretical data , but for @xmath35 larger and smaller density scale @xmath41 .",
    "for a given density scale , @xmath0 is almost independent of @xmath32 , only @xmath73 for constant @xmath1 as we saw above for the simulation data .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 in equation  ( [ eq : epssf ] ) increases with @xmath32 ( because increasing @xmath32 leads to stronger gas compression and thus higher relative sfrs , see fk12 ) , effectively compensating the decrease of @xmath2 with @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , leading to a weak dependence of @xmath78 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "changing the density scale @xmath41 in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](d ) means that the virial parameter is about unity for the filled diamonds and about @xmath79 and @xmath66 for the open diamonds , respectively to the right and to the left of the filled diamonds ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "such a systematic correlation of @xmath56 with @xmath0 is rather unexpected , which is why we add another panel ( e ) where we keep @xmath80 in equation  ( [ eq : epssf ] ) along each model curve .",
    "although variations in @xmath56 by at least two orders of magnitude are measured for mw clouds @xcite and certainly contribute to the scatter , the overall mach number dependence remains , even if we enforce @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](e ) additionally shows the @xcite ( hc ) version of our model for @xmath74 with otherwise identical parameters and @xmath81 ( see fk12 for details of that model ) .",
    "the mach number dependence is stronger , because the critical density in the hc model is @xmath82 unlike in the pn model , where @xmath83 ( see fk12 , table  1 ) .",
    "both the multi - freefall pn and hc models support the basic idea that variations in the star formation relation may be caused by variations in the mach number , but the details of that dependence are subject to significant uncertainties , introduced by the particular choice of model .    finally , figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](f ) shows the effect of varying the efficiency in equation  ( [ eq : epssf ] ) for fixed @xmath26 , which covers a substantial fraction of the observed variations in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for any point in the relation , there is a degeneracy between the mach number and the efficiency , which can only be broken by measuring both @xmath32 and @xmath17 simultaneously .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that the observed scatter in the star formation law can be primarily explained by physical variations in the turbulent mach number @xmath32 and the star formation efficiency @xmath17 .",
    "we find that the observed scatter is not random , but instead depends systematically on @xmath32 and @xmath17 . for a fixed extinction threshold or fixed @xmath1 , we find that @xmath73 , if the standard larson relations are in effect .",
    "although some regions do not follow the standard larson scalings ( e.g.  the cmz and possibly extragalactic regions ) , we still expect a variation of @xmath2 also in such cases , albeit with a potentially different dependence .",
    "we further find that for fixed @xmath1 , the variations in @xmath0 may be explained by variations in the star formation efficiency , systematically @xmath84 ( see figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm]f ) .",
    "the theoretical model , equation  ( [ eq : epssf ] ) , also implies that some fraction of the scatter may be explained by variations in the virial parameter @xmath56 , the turbulent driving parameter @xmath85 , and the thermal - to - magnetic pressure ratio @xmath58 .",
    "we note that @xcite have also recently developed an analytic model for @xmath0 based on the log - normal density pdf and investigated the mach number dependence of their model in the context of kennicutt - schmidt relations , such as plotted in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens ] .",
    "they use mach numbers in the range 120 , gas scale heights of and density thresholds of to explain observations of mw clouds , discs and starbursts .",
    "the relatively low mach numbers come about , because they chose to evaluate @xmath32 for temperatures of the warm interstellar medium ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "it is , however , the cold , molecular phase with @xmath87 ( where a log - normal pdf seems reasonable ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which stars form , so the relevant mach numbers for the star - forming gas are about an order of magnitude higher than assumed in @xcite , because @xmath88 .",
    "our simulations and theoretical models in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm ] make direct predictions that can be tested with observations .",
    "if the mach number and star formation efficiency were indeed the primary physical reasons for the variations in the star formation relation , then measuring @xmath32 and @xmath17 in clouds and galaxies will eventually enable us to test these predictions .",
    "for example , the clouds and yso data in the mw are in the expected range , and , consistent with our theoretical models .",
    "the placement of the cmz is also consistent with @xmath89 , given the uncertainties in the data .",
    "however , measurements of @xmath32 and @xmath17 in extragalactic systems are more difficult . for arp  220 , with large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "arp 220 ( the rightmost downward pointing triangle in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](a ) ) would be more consistent with @xmath90 for @xmath15 , which means that either our model is incorrect or @xmath17 is relatively small for that galaxy , or the measurements of @xmath32 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath91 are so uncertain for arp 220 that it can not be used to falsify the model , or the standard larson relations do not apply for arp 220 , such that a direct matching of mach numbers there and in our models ( that assume standard larson scaling ) can not be done with the present data .",
    "finally , the smc has velocity dispersions of @xmath66@xmath92 @xcite , which gives for , basically consistent with our theoretical model in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm ] , but also with large uncertainties , so we need future observations that simultaneously constrain @xmath32 and @xmath17 .",

    "the simulations were run at lrz ( pr32lo ) and jsc ( hhd20 ) .",
    "here we discuss caveats and limitations of the present study .",
    "first , unlike the classical kennicutt - schmidt relation , which only requires measurements of column - integrated quantities , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the kdm12 model requires an additional estimate of the volume density @xmath38 to compute the freefall time for the abscissa @xmath2 .",
    "the current estimate of @xmath38 by kdm12 assumes that the gas is homogeneously distributed along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "this is clearly an oversimplification , because the gas along the los has likely a range of densities and potentially contributions from different cloud components in the case of very long los .",
    "eventually , a refined model would take the multi - freefall contributions of the pdf of gas densities along the los into account .",
    "secondly , most of the mw cloud and yso data use a fixed star formation time scale of @xmath93 for the class ii phase @xcite to estimate @xmath0 . however , the exact value of @xmath0 depends on the evolutionary phase and requires information about the time evolution of the cloud , which is not available from observations .",
    "thus , estimates of @xmath0 are highly uncertain and some spread of the data is likely caused by this effect .",
    "as a function of beam smoothing factor for @xmath15 ( lower set ) and @xmath94 ( upper set ) . varying the telescope resolution merely shifts the data along the star formation law , @xmath95 ( shown as the dotted lines for @xmath15 and @xmath96 for @xmath26 simulations ; green symbols ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : telescope ] shows the influence of the telescope resolution .",
    "we made synthetic observations of the simulations as in figure  [ fig : sfrcoldens_kdm](b ) , but with up to @xmath97 beam smoothing ( @xmath97 reduced telescope resolution or observing the same cloud at a @xmath97 greater distance ) .",
    "although @xmath0 and @xmath2 are both reduced by beam smoothing , they are reduced by roughly the same factor , such that @xmath74 is almost independent of telescope resolution .",
