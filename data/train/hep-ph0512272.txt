    "as is well - known unitarity triangle fits indicate the prominent role of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism@xcite in cp violation and flavour physics . the huge amount and the variety of cp collected data allows for a systematic search of physics beyond the standard model ( sm)@xcite@xcite .",
    "a quite general and natural framework to go beyond the sm is :    1 .",
    "allow for new physics in every place except in weak tree - level dominated processes .",
    "2 .   assume @xmath12 unitarity .",
    "this framework is general enough to include practically all models of new physics ( np ) except those that explicitly violate @xmath12 unitarity .",
    "going beyond @xmath12 unitarity makes the analysis almost impossible in a model independent way@xcite .",
    "we will proceed in the first part with assumptions 1 and 2 .    to go on with this analysis",
    "it is very important to understand the key role played by a measurement of the unitarity triangle phase @xmath7 .",
    "it is very convenient to write the ckm matrix in the following way@xcite@xcite:@xmath16where the rephasing invariant cp violating phases  are@xcite@xmath17it has been shown from @xmath12 unitarity -@xmath18- that @xmath19 and @xmath20 even outside the sm@xcite .",
    "so @xmath21 is too small to consider its measurement . @xmath22 and @xmath10 , accompanying @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , will enter only in loop processes : virtual transitions @xmath25 .",
    "therefore processes that in the sm measure @xmath22 and @xmath10 could be contaminated by np .",
    "_ processes that measure _ @xmath22 _ in the sm framework will be no longer evidence of cp violation in the ckm matrix in the presence of np_. the unique measurable phase that can be extracted from tree - level processes and therefore not contaminated by np is @xmath7 , because it can appear in a tree - level transition @xmath26 npbotella .    we can conclude that just @xmath7 and the moduli of the first two rows are the unique parameters whose extraction from experimental data is not contaminated by np . or put in another way , these parameters -extracted from weak tree - level decays- are valid in all the models included in our assumptions 1 and 2 .    in section",
    "ii we will parametrize and clarify the np physics contributions to the contaminated flavour and cp observables . having seven experimental data of the ckm matrix in these general class of models , in section iii",
    "we will address the question of the dominance of the ckm mechanism as the origin of cp violation in these models . at the same time , with the contaminated observables , we will set bounds on the np contributions . finally in section iv we will study potential large deviations of @xmath10 from its sm value in models that violates @xmath12 unitarity .",
    "as we have explained the measurements of @xmath22 will be contaminated by np .",
    "also it is known that @xmath22 measurements come always from the @xmath22 contribution to @xmath29 mixing .",
    "the simple reason why @xmath22 contributions to @xmath14 decay amplitudes can not be measured - in a clean theoretical way- is because it always enter in the sm with a second weak phase .",
    "therefore it is enough to parametrize the np contributions to the @xmath29 mixing .",
    "we follow reference branco99 to write the off diagonal mixing matrix as@xmath30the sm corresponds to @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in this way we get@xmath33and therefore , by defining@xmath34we have for the experimental observables@xmath35    clearly an independent knowledge of the full ckm matrix together with the @xmath36 asymmetry @xmath37 and the mass difference @xmath2 will give us the opportunity to test for the np parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    as we will see in the next section ,",
    "the actual knowledge of the moduli of the ckm matrix in the first two rows is not enough to know the entire ckm matrix , so the measurement of gamma is of paramount importance in order to complete the knowledge of the ckm matrix and to proceed with the np analysis .",
    "gamma can be obtained from the phase of the rephasing invariant quartet @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "a way of measuring it from pure tree - level decays is trough the interference of the two pure charged currents decay paths @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite@xcite .",
    "babarbabar1 and belle@xcite have presented results using the dalitz plot analysis in @xmath43 with the subsequent decay @xmath44 . if any potential np in @xmath45 mixing is neglected@xcite , as seems reasonable , these analysis provide a measurement of gamma free from np contributions .",
    "other relevant ways of measuring @xmath7 are the methods to measure  @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "by now it is well - known that using eq.([phases1 ] ) one has @xmath47 by definitionsilva04@xcite .",
    "so a measurement of @xmath48 is nothing else than a measurement of @xmath49 .",
    "the main channels are @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", the presence of penguin pollution could become np pollution , so one has to be much more careful in these processes .",
    "the relevant observables are@xmath52to understand the effects of np let us first neglect the sm penguin pollution and treat the @xmath53 channel as if it were a pure tree level and therefore without np pollution in the decay amplitudes .",
    "in these case we have in the @xmath54 channel@xmath55where @xmath56 .",
    "the cp asymmetry measures @xmath57 .",
    "once we include penguin pollution , the gronau and london isospin analysis can be partially summarized with the following formula@xcite@xcite@xmath58where @xmath59that tell us that @xmath60 can be extracted from the experimental data including branching ratios and @xmath61 . but",
    "@xmath62 in the sm and therefore in our np scenario is a pure tree - level amplitude with weak phase gamma - is proportional to the @xmath63 piece- , so we will have that the observable @xmath60 will be@xmath64we conclude that the usual way of measuring @xmath48 in @xmath53 decays provides us with a measurement of @xmath65 even in the presence of np in the @xmath4 piece@xcite . obviously",
    "the knowledge of @xmath66 from @xmath67 converts these @xmath48 methods in another way of extracting @xmath7 from tree - level pieces .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "within this class of models , in order to investigate whether the present experimental data already implies that ckm is complex , one has to check whether any of the unitarity triangles is constrained by data to be non - flat , i.e. to have a non - vanishing area .",
    "if any one of the triangles does not collapse to a line , no other triangle will collapse , due to the remarkable property that all the unitarity triangles have the same area .",
    "this property simply follows from unitarity of the 3@xmath83 ckm matrix .",
    "the universal area of the unitarity triangles gives a measurement of the strength of cp violation mediated by a @xmath70-interaction and can be obtained from four independent moduli of @xmath71 .",
    "the fact that one can infer about cp violation from the knowledge of cp - conserving quantities should not come as a surprise@xcite .",
    "it just reflects the fact that the strength of cp violation is given by the imaginary part of a rephasing invariant quartet@xcite , @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , which in turn can be expressed in terms of moduli , thanks to 3@xmath83 unitarity . restricting ourselves to the first two rows of @xmath71 , to avoid any contamination from np , a possible choice of independent moduli would be @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "one can then use unitarity of the first two rows to evaluate @xmath78 , which is given , in terms of the input moduli@xcite , by @xmath79note that eq .",
    "( [ j1 ] ) is exact , but the actual extraction of @xmath78 from the chosen input moduli , although possible in principle , it is not feasible in practice .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the present experimental values of @xmath80 and @xmath77 , assuming gaussian probability density distributions around the central values .",
    "we plot in fig.([jpdf ] ) the probability density distribution of @xmath81 , generated using a toy monte carlo calculation .",
    "only @xmath82 of the generated points satisfy the trivial normalization constraints and , among those , only @xmath83 satisfy the condition that the unitarity triangles close @xmath84 .    as we have mentioned , including the experimental data @xmath37 and @xmath85 still does not give evidence of a complex @xmath71",
    ". we can not conclude if @xmath71 is the dominant contribution to cp violation , although we can set bounds on the np parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in fig.([gamma0 ] ) we plot 68% ( black ) , 90% ( dark grey ) and 95% ( grey ) probability regions of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the apex @xmath86 of the @xmath87 unitarity triangle . in fig.([rfi0 ] ) we represent joint pdf regions in the plane @xmath88 , @xmath89 . because @xmath7 gives the apex of the triangle , it is clear from fig.([gamma0 ] ) that there is essentially no restriction on @xmath90 . on the contrary , because the moduli of the first two rows put an upper bound on @xmath91 and upper and lower bounds on @xmath92 , we can see in fig.([rfi0 ] ) significant constraints on @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "including the measurement of gamma in fig.([gamma0 ] ) will fix the unitarity triangle and the @xmath71 matrix .",
    "the enormous effort developed at the b - factories belle and babar has resulted in the first measurements of @xmath7 in tree - level decays @xmath43 , @xmath95 , where the two paths to @xmath96 or @xmath97 interfere in the common decay channel @xmath98 . from a dalitz - plot analysis ,",
    "belle @xcite has presented @xmath99 and babar @xcite @xmath100 , together with the solutions obtained by changing @xmath101 .",
    "we average conservatively both measurements to the value @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , which we take as a quantitative measurement of a complex ckm matrix _ independent of the presence of np at the one - loop weak level_.    babar has also presented a time - dependent analysis of the @xmath104 channel @xcite , that once supplemented with the @xmath105 and @xmath106 branching ratios @xcite and the measurement of the final polarization , can be translated @xcite into the measured value @xmath107 where the last error comes from the usual @xmath108 isospin bounds is the usual @xmath109 but where we have introduced @xmath66 instead of @xmath22 as the phase in the @xmath110@xmath111 mixing . ]",
    "because the measurement is sensitive to @xmath113 , @xmath114 presents a fourfold ambiguity @xmath115 . in the @xmath116 channel the pentagon isospin analysis  from quasi - two - body decays  needs more statistics and/or additional assumptions .",
    "a time - dependent dalitz - plot analysis in the channel @xmath117 has been presented by babar @xcite , with the result @xmath118.since this analysis is sensitive to both @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the resulting ambiguity is just a twofold one @xmath121 .",
    "it is remarkable that these two solutions are in good agreement with two of the solutions coming from the @xmath51 channel .",
    "this important property will be used to eliminate two of the four solutions coming from the @xmath51 channel .",
    "the situation in the @xmath53 channel does not yet allow a full isospin analysis and the isospin bounds are quite poor . furthermore babar and",
    "belle measurements are still in some conflict , so that we will not use these results .    as before , we average the data from @xmath51 and @xmath68 but only keep the two solutions consistent with the @xmath68 channel data .",
    "our averaged values are @xmath122 , ( @xmath123 ) .    to analyze the implications for the dominance of the ckm mechanism for cp violation and the presence of np",
    ", we add both measurements @xmath7 and @xmath124 to the previous analysis presented in figs.([gamma0 ] ) and ( [ rfi0 ] ) .    in fig.([gamma1 ] ) we represent the analogue of fig.([gamma0 ] ) .",
    "we conclude @xcite that a real ckm matrix is excluded at a 99.92% c.l .",
    "and the probability of @xmath125\\cup \\lbrack -170^{\\circ } ; -10^{\\circ } ] $ ] is 99.7% .       in fig([rfi1 ] ) we can see three solutions in the @xmath126 plane with @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in these plots",
    "one has in general four solutions corresponding to the two values of @xmath7 ( @xmath57 ) and to the two signs of @xmath129 the last solution corresponds to @xmath130 .",
    "it is the inclusion of both @xmath7 and @xmath57 constraints that almost eliminates the @xmath131 solutions .",
    "the first solution is obviously the sm one , and the semileptonic asymmetry @xmath132 - not included here - is starting to play an important role@xcite in the exclusion of the solution @xmath133 .",
    "it is important to stress that having an irrefutable piece of evidence for a complex ckm matrix , in a framework where the presence of np is allowed , has profound implications for models of cp violation . in the particular case of models with spontaneous cp violation",
    ", a complex ckm matrix favours the class of models where , although yukawa couplings are real , the vacuum phase responsible for spontaneous cp violation also generates cp violation in charged - current weak interactions .",
    "conversely , the evidence for a complex ckm matrix , even allowing for the presence of np , excludes the class of models with spontaneous cp violation and a real ckm matrix at a 99.92% c.l ..",
    "within the sm and any extension where @xmath135 is unitary , like supersymmetric or multi higgs doublet models , we have the relationbotella03 @xmath136which shows that @xmath137 in any model where @xmath138 ckm unitarity holds . in particular , within",
    "the sm one obtains at 90% cl @xmath139the only models in which @xmath10 can be significantly larger than @xmath140 are those in which @xmath135 is not unitary , what can only be achieved by enlarging the quark sector .",
    "the most simple way of doing this is with the introduction of new quark singlets @xcite .quark singlets often arise in grand unified theories and models with extra dimensions at the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "they have both their left- and right - handed components transforming as singlets under @xmath141 , thus their addition to the sm particle content does not spoil the cancellation of triangle anomalies . in these models , the charged and neutral current terms of the lagrangian in the mass eigenstate basis are@xmath142where @xmath143 and @xmath144 , @xmath145 denotes the extended ckm matrix and @xmath146 , @xmath147 are hermitian matrices . @xmath148 and @xmath149 are not necessarily diagonal and thus flavour - changing neutral couplings ( fcnc ) exist at the tree level , although they are naturally suppressed by the ratio of the standard quark over the heavy singlet masses .",
    "moreover , the diagonal @xmath150 couplings , which are given by the diagonal entries of @xmath148 and @xmath149 plus a charge - dependent term , are also modified . within the sm @xmath151 , @xmath152 for @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 for @xmath153 .",
    "the addition of up - type @xmath13 singlets modifies the first two of these equalities , while the addition of down - type @xmath156 ones modifies the last two .    in models with a down quark singlet , from orthogonality of the second and third columns of @xmath145 ,",
    "one obtains the generalization of eq.([sinchi1])@xmath157 , one obtains@xcite@xcite that at most @xmath158 , thus implying that in this class of models @xmath10 can not be significantly larger than @xmath159 .    in model with an up quark singlet , from orthogonality of the second and third rows of @xmath145 , one gets@xcite@xmath160 in contrast with models containing down - type singlets , where the size of all fcnc is very restricted by experiment , present limits on @xmath161 are rather weak .",
    "the most stringent one , @xmath162 with a 95% cl , is derived from the non - observation of single top production at lep , in the process @xmath163 and its charge conjugate .",
    "this bound does not presently provide an additional restriction on the size of @xmath10 . in models with extra up singlets",
    "@xmath164 can be of order @xmath165 , yielding @xmath166 . from eq.([sinchi3 ] ) , one derives some important phenomenological consequences .",

    "_  at rates observable at lhc__. in addition , the modulus of @xmath161 obeys the equality @xcite@xmath169this relation shows that conditions for achieving @xmath168 are to have a small deviation @xmath170 of @xmath171 from unity ( which is allowed by the measurement of @xmath172 and @xmath173 @xcite ) and a deviation of @xmath174 from unity of order @xmath159 .",
    "this deviation is only possible if the mass of new top quark @xmath175 is bellow @xmath176 tev , again testable at lhc .",
    "finally the @xmath177 mass difference sets bounds on @xmath178 that for large @xmath167 - @xmath179 - translate into bounds on @xmath180 in such a way that deviations of unitarity in the first row are not observable . by the same token , large values of @xmath10",
    "will be correlated with an important contribution to @xmath181 mixing @xcite .    the shaded area in fig.([rangechi ] )",
