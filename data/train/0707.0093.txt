    "the problem of stacking  @xmath0 blocks on a table so as to achieve maximum overhang has a long history .",
    "it appears in physics and engineering textbooks from as early as the mid 19th century ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem was apparently first brought to the attention of the mathematical community in 1923 when j.g .",
    "coffin posed it in the  problems and solutions \" section of the american mathematical monthly  @xcite ; no solution was presented there .",
    "the problem recurred from time to time over subsequent years , e.g. , @xcite , achieving much added notoriety from its appearance in 1964 in martin gardner s  mathematical games \" column of _ scientific american _ @xcite .",
    "most of the references mentioned above describe the now classical _ harmonic stacks _ in which @xmath0 unit - length blocks are placed one on top of the other , with the @xmath3 block from the top extending by @xmath4 beyond the block below it .",
    "the overhang achieved by such stacks is @xmath5 .",
    "the cases @xmath6 and  @xmath7 are illustrated at the top of figure  [ fig : opt34 ] above , and the cases @xmath8 and @xmath9 are shown in the background of figure  [ fig : pz ] . verifying that harmonic stacks are _ balanced _ and can be made _",
    "( see definitions in the next section ) by minute displacements is an easy exercise .",
    "( this is the form in which the problem appears in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "harmonic stacks show that arbitrarily large overhangs can be achieved if sufficiently many blocks are available .",
    "they have been used by countless teachers as an introduction to recurrence relations , the harmonic series and simple optimization problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many readers of the above mentioned references were led to believe that @xmath10 , the overhang achieved by harmonic stacks , is the _ maximum _ overhang that can be achieved using  @xmath0 blocks .",
    "this is indeed the case under the restriction , explicit or implicit in some of these references , that the blocks should be stacked in a _",
    "one - on - one _ fashion , with each block resting on at most one other block .",
    "it has been known for some time , however , that larger overhangs may be obtained if the one - on - one restriction is lifted .",
    "three blocks , for example , can easily be used to obtain an overhang of  1 .",
    "ainley @xcite found that four blocks can be used to obtained an overhang of about 1.16789 , as shown at the bottom right of figure  [ fig : opt34 ] , and this is more than 10% larger than the overhang of the corresponding harmonic stack . using computers , paterson and",
    "zwick @xcite found the optimal stacks with a given limited number of blocks .",
    "their solutions with 20 and 30 blocks are shown in figure  [ fig : pz ] .",
    "now what happens when @xmath0 grows large ?",
    "can general stacks , not subject to the one - on - one restriction , improve upon the overhang achieved by the harmonic stacks by more than a constant factor , or is overhang of order @xmath1 the best that can be achieved ? in a recent cover article in the _ american journal of physics _ ,",
    "hall @xcite observes that the addition of counterbalancing blocks to one - on - one stacks can double ( asymptotically ) the overhang obtainable by harmonic stacks .",
    "however , he then incorrectly concludes that no further improvement is possible , thus perpetuating the order @xmath1 `` mythology '' .",
    "recently , however , paterson and zwick @xcite discovered that the modest improvements gained for small values of  @xmath0 by using layers with multiple blocks mushroom into an exponential improvement for large values of  @xmath0 , yielding overhang of order @xmath2 instead of just @xmath1 .",
    "but is @xmath2 the right answer , or is it just the start of another mythology ? in their deservedly popular book _",
    "mad about physics _",
    "@xcite , jargodzki and potter rashly claim that inverted triangles ( such as the one shown on the left of figure  [ fig : pyramid ] ) are balanced .",
    "if so , they would achieve overhangs of order @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out , however , that already the @xmath12-row inverted triangle is unbalanced , and collapses as shown on the right of figure  [ fig : pyramid ] , as do all larger inverted triangles .",
    "the collapse of the @xmath12-row triangle begins with the lifting of the middle block in the top row .",
    "it is tempting to try to avoid this failure by using a diamond shape instead as illustrated in figure  [ fig : collapse ] .",
    "diamonds were considered by drummond  @xcite , and like the inverted triangle , they would achieve an overhang of order @xmath11 , though with a smaller leading constant .",
    "the stability analysis of diamonds is slightly more complicated than that of inverted triangles , but it can be shown that @xmath13-diamonds , i.e. , diamonds that have @xmath13 blocks in their largest row , are stable if and only if @xmath14 . in figure",
    "[ fig : collapse ] we see a practical demonstration with @xmath15 .",
    "-diamond in theory and practice.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] -diamond in theory and practice.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    -diamond in theory and practice.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] -diamond in theory and practice.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    it is not hard to show that particular constructions like larger inverted triangles or diamonds are unstable .",
    "this instability of inverted triangles and diamonds was already noted in @xcite .",
    "however , this does not rule out the possibility of a smarter balanced way of stacking @xmath0 blocks so as to achieve an overhang of order @xmath11 , and that would be much better than the above mentioned overhang of order @xmath2 achieved by paterson and zwick @xcite .",
    "paterson and zwick did consider this general question .",
    "they did not rule out an overhang of order @xmath11 , but they proved that no larger overhang would be possible .",
    "thus their work shows that the order of the maximum overhang with @xmath0 blocks has to be somewhere between @xmath2 and @xmath11 .",
    "we show here that an overhang of order @xmath2 , as obtained by  @xcite , is in fact best possible .",
    "more specifically , we show that any @xmath0-block stack with an overhang of at least @xmath16 is unbalanced , and must hence collapse .",
    "thus we conclude that the maximum overhang with @xmath0 blocks is of order @xmath2 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a precise mathematical definition of the overhang problem , explaining in particular when a stack of blocks is said to be _ balanced _ ( and when it is said to be _ stable _ ) . in section",
    "[ sec : wall ] we briefly review the paterson - zwick construction of stacks that achieve an overhang of order  @xmath2 . in section  [ sec : mass ]",
    "we introduce a class of abstract mass movement problems and explain the connection between these problems and the overhang problem . in section  [ sec",
    ": bounds ] we obtain bounds for mass movement problems that imply the order @xmath2 upper bound on overhang .",
    "we end in section  [ sec : concl ] with some concluding remarks and open problems .",
    "we briefly state the mathematical definition of the overhang problem . for more details , see @xcite . as in previous papers ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite , the overhang problem is taken here to be a two - dimensional problem : each block is represented by a frictionless rectangle whose long sides are parallel to the table .",
    "our upper bounds apply , however , in much more general settings , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "stacks are composed of blocks that are assumed to be identical , homogeneous , frictionless rectangles of unit length , unit weight and height  @xmath17 .",
    "our results here are clearly independent of @xmath17 , and our figures use any convenient height .",
    "previous authors have thought of blocks as cubes , books , coins , playing cards , etc .",
    "a stack @xmath18 of @xmath0 blocks resting on a flat table is specified by giving the coordinates @xmath19 of the lower left corner of each block @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the upper right corner of the table is at @xmath21 and that the table extends arbitrarily far to the left .",
    "thus block @xmath20 is identified with the box @xmath22\\times [ y_i , y_i+h]$ ] ( its length aligned with the @xmath23-axis ) , and the table , which we conveniently denote by @xmath24 , with the region @xmath25\\times ( -\\infty,0]$ ] .",
    "two blocks are allowed to touch each other , but their interiors must be disjoint .",
    "we say that block @xmath20 _ rests _ on block @xmath26 , denoted `` @xmath27 '' , if and only if @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 , i.e. , block @xmath20 rests on the table .",
    "if @xmath27 , we let @xmath32\\times \\{y_i\\}$ ] be their _ contact interval_. if @xmath33 , then @xmath34 and @xmath35 . if @xmath36 then @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the _ overhang _ of a stack is defined to be @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath18 be a stack composed of  @xmath0 blocks .",
    "if  @xmath20 rests on  @xmath26 , then  @xmath26 may apply an upward force of @xmath40 on  @xmath20 , in which case  @xmath20 will reciprocate by applying a downward force of the same magnitude on  @xmath26 . since the blocks and table are frictionless , all the forces acting on them are vertical .",
    "the force  @xmath41 may be assumed to be applied at a single point @xmath42 in the contact interval @xmath43 .",
    "a downward gravitational force of unit magnitude is applied on  @xmath20 at its center of gravity @xmath44 .",
    "[ d : equi ] let @xmath45 be a homogeneous block of unit length and unit weight , and let @xmath46 be the @xmath23-coordinate of its left edge .",
    "let @xmath47 be the positions and the magnitudes of the upward forces applied to  @xmath45 along its bottom edge , and let @xmath48 be the positions and magnitudes of the upward forces applied by  @xmath45 , along its top edge , on other blocks of the stack .",
    "then , @xmath45 is said to be in _ equilibrium _ under these collections of forces if and only if @xmath49 the first equation says that the _ net force _ applied to  @xmath45 is zero while the second says that the _ net moment _ is zero .",
    "[ d : bal ] a stack @xmath18 is said to be _ balanced _ if there exists a collection of forces acting between the blocks along their contact intervals , such that under this collection of forces , and the gravitational forces acting on them , all blocks are in equilibrium .",
    "the stacks presented in figures  [ fig : opt34 ] and  [ fig : pz ] are balanced .",
    "they are , however , _",
    "precariously _ balanced , with some minute displacement of their blocks leading to imbalance and collapse .",
    "a stack can be said to be _ stable _ if all stacks obtained by sufficiently small displacements of its blocks are balanced .",
    "we do not make this definition formal as it is not used in the rest of the paper , though we refer to it in some informal discussions .",
    "a schematic description of a stable stack and a collection of balancing forces acting between its blocks is given in figure  [ fig : fg ] .",
    "only upward forces are shown in the figure but corresponding downward forces are , of course , present .",
    "( we note in passing that balancing forces , when they exist , are in general not uniquely determined .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as _",
    "static indeterminacy_. )    we usually adopt the convention that the blocks of a balanced stack are numbered consecutively from bottom to top and from left to right .",
    "block @xmath50 is then the leftmost block in the lowest level while @xmath51 is the rightmost block at the top level . for every @xmath52 , we let @xmath53 be a collection of upward balancing forces applied by blocks in @xmath54 on blocks in @xmath55 .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : fg ] . )",
    "we refer to  @xmath53 as the collection of forces that cross the @xmath56-th _ slice _ of the stack .",
    "let us examine the relationship between two consecutive collections  @xmath53 and  @xmath57 .",
    "the only forces present in  @xmath53 but not in  @xmath57 are upward forces applied to  @xmath20 , while the only forces present in  @xmath57 but not in  @xmath53 are upward forces applied by  @xmath20 to blocks resting upon it .",
    "if we let @xmath47 be the positions and the magnitudes of the upward forces applied to  @xmath20 , and @xmath58 be the positions and magnitudes of the upward forces applied by  @xmath20 , and if we let  @xmath46 be the @xmath23-coordinate of the left edge of  @xmath20 , we get by definitions  [ d : equi ] and  [ d : bal ] , that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "block  @xmath20 thus _ rearranges _ the forces in the interval @xmath61 $ ] in a way that preserves the total magnitude of the forces and their total moment , when its own weight is taken into account .",
    "note that all forces of  @xmath62 act in non - positive positions , and that if  @xmath63 is the most overhanging block in a stack and the overhang achieved by it is  @xmath13 , then the total magnitude of the forces in  @xmath64 that act at or beyond position  @xmath65 should be at least  @xmath66 .",

    "stacks that achieve a maximum overhang are on the verge of collapse and thus unstable . in most cases ,",
    "however , overhangs arbitrarily close to the maximum overhang may be obtained using stable stacks .",
    "( probably the only counterexample is the case @xmath6 . )",
    "paterson and zwick @xcite describe a family of balanced @xmath0-block stacks that achieve an overhang of about @xmath67 .",
    "more precisely , they construct for every integer @xmath68 a balanced stack containing @xmath69 blocks that achieves an overhang of  @xmath70 . their construction , for @xmath71 , is illustrated in figure  [ fig:6stack ] .",
    "the construction is an example of what @xcite terms a _ brick - wall _ stack , which resembles the simple `` stretcher - bond '' pattern in real - life bricklaying . in each row",
    "the blocks are contiguous , with each block centered over the ends of blocks in the row beneath .",
    "overall the stack is symmetric and has a roughly parabolic shape , with vertical axis at the table edge .",

    "@xmath74-slab _ has height @xmath75 and consists of alternating @xmath74-rows and @xmath76-rows , the bottom and top rows being @xmath74-rows .",

    "the construction itself is just a @xmath13-stack and so has overhang @xmath70 ; its total number of blocks is given by @xmath79 .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite , using an inductive argument , that @xmath13-stacks , for any @xmath68 , are balanced .",
    "why should a parabolic shape be appropriate ?",
    "some support for this comes from considering the effect of a block in spreading a single force of  @xmath80 acting from below into two forces of almost  @xmath81 exerted upwards from its edges .",
    "this spreading behavior is analogous to a symmetric random walk on a line or to difference equations for the `` heat - diffusion '' process in a linear strip . in both cases",
    "we see that time of about  @xmath82 is needed for effective spreading to width  @xmath13 , corresponding to a parabolic stack profile .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ t - main ] , states that the parabolic stacks of @xcite are optimal , up to constant factors .",
    "better constant factors can probably be obtained , however .",
    "paterson and zwick @xcite present some numerical evidence that suggests that the overhang that can be achieved using  @xmath0 blocks , for large values of  @xmath0 , is at least @xmath83 .",
    "for more on this , see section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "our upper bound on the maximum achievable overhang is obtained by considering _",
    "mass movement _ problems that are an abstraction of the way in which balancing forces `` flow '' though a stack of blocks .",
    "( see the discussion at the end of section  [ ss - force ] . )    in a mass movement problem we are required to transform an initial _ mass distribution _ into a mass distribution that satisfies certain conditions .",
    "the key condition is that a specified amount of mass be moved to or beyond a certain position .",
    "we can transform one mass distribution into another by performing local _",
    "moves _ that redistribute mass within a given interval in a way that preserves the total mass and the center of mass .",
    "our goal is then to show that many moves are required to accomplish the task .",
    "as can be seen , masses here correspond to forces , mass distributions correspond to collections of forces , and moves mimic the effects of blocks .",
    "the mass movement problems considered are formally defined in sections  [ ss - dist ] and  [ ss - moves ] .",
    "the correspondence between the mass movement problems considered and the overhang problem is established in section  [ ss - corres ] .",

    "so @xmath431 we also have @xmath432 since @xmath433 and @xmath434 for @xmath435 , and @xmath436 and @xmath437 for @xmath438 , and @xmath439 for @xmath440 .",

    "we end the section by noting that although the inequalities of lemmas  [ l - sm2 ] and  [ l - extreme ] are only claimed for discrete distributions , which is all we need in this paper , our proofs can be easily modified to show that they hold also for general continuous distributions .",
    "in fact , for non - trivial discrete distributions , the inequalities in the two lemmas are always _ strict_. in the continuous case , the inequalities are satisfied with equality by appropriately chosen uniform distributions . in particular , the constant factors @xmath444 and @xmath12 appearing in the two lemmas can not be improved .",
    "we have shown that the maximum overhang achieved using  @xmath0 homogeneous , frictionless blocks of unit length is at most @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the constructions of @xcite can not be improved by more than a constant factor , establishing order @xmath2 as the asymptotic answer to the age - old overhang problem .    the discussions and results presented so far all referred to the standard two - dimensional version of the overhang problem .",
    "our results hold , however , in greater generality .",
    "we briefly discuss some natural generalizations and variants of the overhang problem for which our bounds still apply .",
    "in section  [ sec : model ] we stipulated that all blocks have a given height  @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that all our results remain valid even if blocks have different heights , but still have unit length and unit weight . in particular ,",
    "blocks are allowed to degenerate into _ sticks _ , i.e. , have height  @xmath313 .",
    "also , even though we required blocks not to overlap , we did not use this condition in any of our proofs .    _ loaded stacks _",
    ", introduced in  @xcite , are stacks composed of standard unit length and unit weight blocks , and _ point weights _ that can have arbitrary weight .",
    "( point weights may be considered to be blocks of zero height and length , but nonzero weight . ) our results , with essentially no change , imply that loaded stacks of total weight  @xmath0 can have an overhang of at most @xmath16 .",
    "what happens when we are allowed to use blocks of different lengths and weights ?",
    "our results can be generalized in a fairly straightforward way to show that if a block of length  @xmath263 has weight proportional to  @xmath445 , as would be the case if all blocks were similar three - dimensional cuboids , then the overhang of a stack of total weight  @xmath0 is again of order at most @xmath2 .",
    "it is amusing to note that in this case an overhang of order  @xmath2 can be obtained by stacking @xmath0 unit - length blocks as in the construction of  @xcite , or simply by balancing a single block of length  @xmath2 and weight  @xmath0 at the edge of the table !",
    "might this mean that there is some physical principle that could have told us , without all the calculations , that the right answer to the original overhang problem had to be of order @xmath2 ?",
    "theorem  [ t - m2 ] supplies an almost tight upper bound for the following variant of the overhang problem : how far away from the edge of a table can a mass of weight  1 be supported using  @xmath0 _ weightless _ blocks of length  @xmath66 , and a collection of point weights of total weight @xmath0 ?",
    "the overhang in this case beats the classical one by a factor of between @xmath446 and @xmath1 . in all variants considered so far ,",
    "blocks were assumed to have their largest faces parallel to the table s surface and perpendicular to its edge .",
    "the assumption of no friction then immediately implied that all forces within a stack are vertical , and our analysis , which assumes that there are no horizontal forces , was applicable .",
    "a nice argument , communicated to us by harry paterson , shows that in the frictionless two - dimensional case , horizontal forces can not be present even if some of the blocks are tilted .",
    "our results thus apply also in this case .",
    "-diamond.,width=302 ]    we believe that our bounds apply , with slightly adjusted constants , also in three dimensions , but proving so remains an open problem .",
    "overhang larger by a factor of @xmath447 may be obtained with @xmath448 blocks , where @xmath449 , using a technique called _ skintling _ ( see figure  [ fig : skintling ] ) . in skintling ( a term we learned from an edifying conversation with john h. conway about brick - laying ) each block is rotated about its vertical axis , so that  in our case  the diagonal of its bottom face is perpendicular to the edge of the table . with suitably adjusted notion of length",
    ", however , our bounds apply to any three - dimensional construction that can be balanced using vertical forces .",
    "it is an interesting open problem whether there exist three - dimensional stacks composed of frictionless , possibly tilted , blocks that can only be balanced with the aid of some non - vertical forces .",
    "( we know that this is possible if the blocks are _ nonhomogeneous _ and are of different sizes . ) as mentioned , we believe that our bounds do apply in three dimensions , even if it turns out that non - vertical forces are sometimes useful , but proving this requires some additional arguments .",
    "we end by commenting on the tightness of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "our main result is a  @xmath16 upper bound on the overhang that may be obtained using  @xmath0 blocks . as mentioned after the proof of theorem  [ t - gen ] , this bound can be easily improved to about @xmath369 , for sufficiently large values of  @xmath0 .",
    "various other small improvements in the constants are possible .",
    "for example , a careful examination of our proofs reveals that whenever we apply lemma  [ l - extreme ] , the distribution @xmath141 contains at most three masses in the interval acted upon by the move that produces  @xmath107 .",
    "( this follows from the fact that a block can rest upon at most three other blocks . ) the constant  @xmath12 appearing in lemma  [ l - extreme ] can then be improved , though it is optimal when no assumption regarding the distribution  @xmath141 is made .",
    "we believe , however , that new ideas would be needed to reduce the upper bound to below , say , @xmath450 .",
    "as mentioned , paterson and zwick  @xcite describe simple balanced @xmath0-block stacks that achieve an overhang of about @xmath451 .",
    "they also present some numerical evidence that suggests that the overhang that can be achieved using  @xmath0 blocks , for large values of  @xmath0 , is at least @xmath83 .",
    "these larger overhangs are obtained using stacks that are shaped like the `` oil - lamp '' depicted in figure  [ fig : oil - lamp ] . for more details on the figure and on `` oil - lamp '' constructions ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "( the stack shown in the figure is actually a loaded stack , as defined above , with the external forces shown representing the point weights . )",
    "a small gap still remains between the best upper and lower bounds currently available for the overhang problem , though they are both of order @xmath2 .",
    "determining a constant  @xmath231 such that the maximum overhang achievable using  @xmath0 blocks is asymptotically @xmath452 is a challenging open problem .",
    "we would like to thank john h. conway , johan hstad , harry paterson , anders thorup and benjy weiss for useful discussions observations , some of which appear with due credit within the paper ."
