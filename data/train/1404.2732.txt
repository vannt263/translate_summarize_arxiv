    "spin hall effect ( she ) refers to the phenomenon in which a transverse pure spin current is induced in response to a longitudinal applied electric field.@xcite the generation of spin hall current is associated with spin separation in the transverse direction , which had been explained in many previous studies.@xcite sinova _ et al .",
    "_ derived a momentum - dependent spin polarization,@xcite in which electrons moving in the opposite transverse @xmath0direction in a rashba system acquire opposite spin polarization , resulting in spin separation and she . on the other hand , murakami _ et al .",
    "_ studied the effect in @xmath1-doped semiconductors,@xcite where the separation of electron spins is as a result of an anomalous spin - dependent velocity .",
    "these two mechanisms were then brought under a unified framework by fujita _",
    "_ invoking the gauge field in time space.@xcite in another work by shen,@xcite a heuristic picture of spin separation is given in terms of the spin force .",
    "in this picture , electrons traveling in a 2deg system under the influence of a spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect experience a _ transverse _ spin force , which induces separation of spin . however , the spin separation due to transverse spin force was employed to describe the _ zitterbewegung _ ( jitter ) motion of electrons , but not the she . in another study,@xcite the spin force and spin hall effect",
    "are shown to be linked .",
    "however , the spin hall conductivity is still not derived .",
    "recently , we have also applied the spin force picture to study the she in rashba - dresselhaus system@xcite using non - abelian gauge field and shown that the _ longitudinal _ spin force can induce a _ transverse _",
    "spin hall current , from which we recovered the universal spin hall conductivities .",
    "this picture is consistent with others,@xcite which assigned the underlying mechanism of the she to the spin precession of electrons under acceleration .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize this spin force picture of the she for a general soc system , such as the cubic - dresselhaus,@xcite and heavy hole system based on iii - v semiconductor quantum wells.@xcite it may also be extended to other systems governed by the same class of hamiltonian involving the coupling between momentum and a spin - like degree of freedom , such as the graphene systems.@xcite we derived the relation between the spin force and spin current , and showed that the longitudinal force component is responsible for the shc . from this general relation ,",
    "we recover the spin hall conductivities obtained previously using kubo s formula .",
    "the spin force framework not only presents a unified picture of she in a wide class of soc systems , but also gives an intuitive picture of its underlying mechanism , which is not obvious from the linear response or kubo theory .",
    "_ quantum spin force equation _",
    "+ we begin with the general soc hamiltonian in presence of applied electric field : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the effective mass , @xmath4is the momentum - dependent effective magnetic field , which arises from the soc effect , and @xmath5 with @xmath6 is the applied electric field .",
    "the above hamiltonian has eigen - energies : @xmath7 corresponding to eigen - vestors @xmath8 respectively , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the spherical polar angles of the vector @xmath11 in @xmath12-space .",
    "the dynamics of electron in this system is described by equations of motion in the heisenberg picture : @xmath13=\\frac{{{\\bf{p}}}}{m}+{\\nabla{}}_{\\bf{p}}\\bf{b}.\\hat{\\sigma{}},\\label{eq4}\\\\ \\dot{\\bf{p}}&=&\\frac{i}{\\hbar{}}\\left[h,\\bf{p}\\right]=e\\bf{e},\\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in , we have made use of @xmath14 .",
    "likewise , the spin dynamics can be shown to be governed by following equation : @xmath15=\\frac{2}{\\hbar{}}\\left(\\bf{b}\\times{}\\hat{\\sigma{}}\\right ) .",
    "% eq5\\ ] ]    the force acting on electron can then be derived by taking time - derivative of eq . , and using the results of eq . and for the time derivatives of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "this yields : @xmath18 with @xmath19    in the above , we assume that repeated indices are summed up , and @xmath20 denotes taking expectation value in spin - space .",
    "we note that , in presence of an applied electric field , the linear response of the spin polarization can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the solution of equation in the absence of electric field , and @xmath23 is the linear correction due to the electric field .",
    "it is obvious that the spin will alight along the effective soc field when the electric field is absent , i.e. , @xmath24 . to fulfill the normalization of the total spin polarization in eq .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath25 , we must have @xmath26 which means that the electric field induces a spin correction that is perpendicular to the effective soc field .    with these",
    ", the force equation can be rewritten as follow @xmath27 in which the higher order term in electric field is ignored , and @xmath28 since @xmath29 is assymetric while @xmath30 is symmetric in exchanging @xmath31 .",
    "+ _ classical spin force equation _",
    "+ although in quantum mechanics , the force concept is not well - defined as a consequence of the uncertainty principle , we can still establish a connection between the expectation value of the force operator and the well - defined classical force .",
    "while the former is derived from the heisenberg s equation of motion , the latter can be obtained from the energy of a physical system by applying hamilton s equations . indeed ,",
    "if a physical system has energy @xmath32which is a function of position and conjugate momentum , its dynamics can be described by the coupled equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , the classical force acting on the system is given by @xmath35 .",
    "we now relate this classical force to the expectation value of force operator @xmath36 of a quantum system , i.e. , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 denoting the eigen - state index ( we assume that the quantum system can exist in different eigen - states @xmath38 ) . in our present case , by considering the eigen - energies in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the spin force is readily obtained as :    @xmath39    with @xmath40 being the eigen - branch index . in the above equation ,",
    "the second term on the right hand side is odd either in @xmath41 or @xmath42 if @xmath43 , and it is even when @xmath44 ; this means that upon averaging the above force equation over the fermi sphere , only term with @xmath44 contributes to the total force .",
    "therefore , if the electric field is just applied along the longitudinal @xmath45-direction , there only net longitudinal force exists in the system .",
    "interestingly , we can express the above force as @xmath46 which bears a similarity to the spin force in eq ..    eqs . and relates the spin polarization to the force ( electric field ) driving the electric current , and thus enables us to quantify other spin - dependent transport effects , e.g. spin hall effect , or spin separation , in terms of the spin force . in following part",
    ", we will show that in general , the spin hall current can be regarded as being induced by the spin force .",
    "for any general soc system , we can thus derive spin hall current and the associated spin hall conductivity , once we have obtained the expression of spin force .",
    "by definition , the spin current operator is @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the anti - commutation relation , @xmath49 is the spin of carriers ( with @xmath50 for electron , and @xmath51 for heavy hole in a luttinger system ) . with the velocity operator given in eq . ( 4 ) , the spin current operator then reads as @xmath52 in the above , the first term depends on spin polarization which is induced by applied electric field , the second term represents the spin current in equilibrium state , i.e. , in the absence of @xmath6 field , while the last term relates to the variation of effective field in @xmath53-space . in our study , we focus on the spin hall current contribution which is proportional to the electric field , i.e. , the first term only : @xmath54 the total spin hall current @xmath55 can be obtained by integrating above expression over the momentum space . in the framework of linear response theory , the spin hall current in semiconductors with soc exhibits the general response of [ 3,4 ] @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the spin hall conductivity .",
    "thus , if an electric field is applied along one of the axes , e.g. , the @xmath45-direction , there would be two non - zero transverse spin current components @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which would in turn induce spin accumulation @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , and that @xmath62 . moreover , there is only longitudinal spin force ( along @xmath63direction ) acting on electron as discussed above . from now on , we will just consider this case for simplicity .",
    "with eqs . , and , we can establish the relation between the longitudinal spin force acting on the electron and the resulting transverse spin current .    from eq .",
    ", we have following identity : @xmath64 . with this , the longitudinal component of spin force ( without the @xmath65 term ) in eq .",
    "can be expressed as : @xmath66 where the spin polarizations have been replaced by the corresponding spin currents in eq .. from eq .",
    ", it can clearly be seen that the longitudinal spin force induces transverse hall currents ( fig.[fig1]).by comparing the above spin force relations with the classical analogue [ eqs . or ] , we can thus obtain the explicit expression for the spin hall current , as well as the spin hall conductivity .",
    "indeed , we can rewrite the force in eq . as : @xmath67",
    "in which we have used the relation @xmath68 . by substituting above force expression into eq .",
    ", the spin hall current components are readily obtained as follows :    [ eq17c ] @xmath69    if the electron motion is confined to a 2d plane ( @xmath70 plane ) , we have @xmath71 , and @xmath72 following eq .. this means that the transverse spin hall current in 2d system is given by eq ..    eq . and eqs .",
    "are our main results . by deriving the spin force in heisenberg picture and its classical counterpart using hamilton s equations ,",
    "we have explicitly obtained the transverse spin hall currents . in the next section",
    ", we will apply our analysis to a wide class of of systems for describing the she .     and",
    "@xmath73 corresponding to the spin polarizations in @xmath74 and @xmath75direction , respectively.[fig1],scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "we will now illustrate the utility of the spin force picture in evaluating the spin hall current in exemplary 2d and 3d soc systems , the corresponding hamiltonian of which is listed in table [ tab1 ] , together with their respective effective magnetic fields @xmath76 . for each system",
    ", we will consider the spin force equation [ eqs .",
    "] , and evaluate the @xmath77 matrix based on eq . .",
    "next , we calculate the classical force based on its expectation value when the electron is in the eigenstate @xmath78 [ eq . ( 9 ) ] . by equating the classical and quantum mechanical spin force expression , we obtain the expression for the spin current for the state @xmath78 corresponding to the @xmath38-th eigen - branch and momentum .",
    "finally , the total spin current of the system is obtained by summing over the momentum space and eigen - branches of the system .",
    "+       _ a ) linear rashba - dresselhaus system _ + from eq .",
    ", the equation relating the spin force to the spin current in this system is readily found to be : @xmath79 meanwhile , considering eq . , the classical force corresponding to eigen - states@xmath80is @xmath81 for the @xmath82 eigen - branches .",
    "it is obvious that the spin force in both eqs . and will vanish if @xmath83 . for the case of @xmath84 , by equating and , integrating over @xmath16 and summing over the contribution of the two eigen - branches , the spin current is readily shown to be @xmath85 a result which is consistent with previous calculations based on kubo linear response theory.@xcite    it is instructive at this point to note that for the linear rashba - dresselhaus system , the quantum spin force operator in eq .",
    ", obtained from the general form of eq .  , can be couched in terms of the lorentz force in the non - abelian gauge formalism .",
    "this may be seen by rewriting the rashba - dresselhaus hamiltonian in the form of non - abelian(or yang - mills ) gauge fields as follows : @xmath86 where the non - abelian gauge field is @xmath87 then , the effective yang - mills magnetic field associated with this gauge is given by @xmath88=\\frac{2m^2\\left({\\alpha{}}^2-{\\beta{}}^2\\right)}{e\\hbar{}}{\\sigma{}}^z\\hat{z}.\\ ] ] the above field then exerts a lorentz - like force on the electron : @xmath89 . substituting the above expression for the non - abelian @xmath90",
    ", we have @xmath91      _ b ) heavy hole quantum well system _",
    "+ for heavy hole in quantum well , the spin of carriers is @xmath93 , so that the force equation is @xmath94 in which the magnitude of the soc field is @xmath95 , which also yields the classical force @xmath96 from these two equations , the spin current reads @xmath97 which is summed over momentum space and two branches to give total value : @xmath98 this result is consistent with previous findings obtained via the kubo formula.@xcite + _ c ) cubic @xmath99-dresselhaus _ + in @xmath99- dresselhaus system , there are two spin hall current components @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath73 given in eqs .. introducing the chiral spin current as @xmath101 , which explicitly reads : @xmath102 the total spin hall current is then : @xmath103 using the inter - band relation with small spin - split @xmath104 , with @xmath105 is the average fermi momentum , the above shc is simplified to      which recovers previous results.@xcite + in summary , we have described the spin hall effect in various semiconductor soc systems by invoking the spin force picture , both in the quantum mechanical and classical sense .",
    "the former relates the longitudinal force to a transverse spin current carrying a perpendicular spin polarization via the heisenberg s equation of motion . for the specific case of linear rashba - dresselhaus system",
    ", the spin force can be related to the lorentz - like force arising from a non - abelian ( yang - mills ) field .",
    "the classical spin force equation then enables an explicit evaluation of the transverse spin current and hence the spin hall conductivity . the calculated spin hall conductivities are consistent with those obtained via other methods .",
