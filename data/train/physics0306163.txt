    "recently , there has been increasing interest in studying the noise - induced transport of brownian particles for systems with a spatially periodic potential field .",
    "it has been shown that asymmetry of the potential @xcite@xcite , the asymmetry of the driving noise @xcite , and the input signal@xcite are ingredients for the transport .",
    "these subjects were motivated by the challenge to explain undirection of transport in biological systems , and several models have been proposed to describe muscle s contraction@xcite@xcite@xcite , or the asymmetric polymerization of actin filaments responsible of cell motility@xcite .",
    "rectification of noise leading to unidirectional motion in ratchet systems has been an active field of research over the last decade . in these systems directed brownian motion of particles is induced by nonequilibrium noise in the absence of any net macroscopic forces and potential gradients .",
    "several physical models have been proposed : rocking ratchets @xcite , fashing ratchets @xcite , diffusion ratchets @xcite , correlation ratchets @xcite , etc . in all these studies",
    "the potential is taken to be asymmetric in space .",
    "it has also been shown that one can obtain unidirectional current in the presence of spatially asymmetric potentials .",
    "for these nonequilibrium systems external random force should be time asymmetric or the presence of space dependent mobility is required .",
    "the study of current reversal phenomena has given rise to research activity on its own .",
    "the motivation being possibility of new particle separation devices superior to existing methods such as electrophoretic method for particles of micrometer scale@xcite .",
    "it is known that current reversals in ratchet systems can be engendered by changing various system parameters@xcite@xcite , including flatness parameter of the noise@xcite , the correlation time of nonequilibrium fluctuations@xcite , the temperature in multinoise cases@xcite , the power spectrum of the noise source@xcite , the shape of the potential@xcite , the number of interacting particles per unit cell@xcite and the mass of the particles@xcite . in this paper , we study the current of a brownian particle in periodic symmetric potential in the presence of asymmetric unbiased fluctuation and the inhomogeneous friction and show when the current reversals occur .",
    "the brownian dynamics of the overdamped particle moving under the influence of a symmetric potential @xmath0 and subject to a space dependent friction coefficient @xmath1 and asymmetric unbiased fluctuations at temperature @xmath2 , is described by the langevin equation@xcite @xmath3^{2}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{b}t}{\\gamma(x)}}\\xi(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is randomly fluctuating gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation : @xmath5 . here",

    "3 , we can see that when the asymmetry parameter is negative the current reversal may occur ( @xmath24=-0.3 , -0.5 , -0.7 ) and the current vanishes for lower temperature as well as higher temperature .     versus rocking force @xmath29 for different values of @xmath24 ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "when @xmath37 and @xmath24=0.3(@xmath26 ) , the current reversal may occur and the current saturates to zero for high temperature , namely in high temperature the ratchet effect disappears . in the fig .",

    "the other parameters is the same as the fig .",
    "6 . from the fig .",
    "7 we can see that the current reversal vs @xmath29 occurs at the case @xmath11<@xmath30,@xmath24>0 .",
    "the current saturates to a negative constant for large value of @xmath29 which is similar to the fig . 4    when the fluctuation is temporally asymmetric , its correlation properties in either direction are different , and a net current can arise even in the absence of a spatial asymmetry and a space dependent friction@xcite .",
    "the positive asymmetric parameters induce a positive direction current while the negative parameters give a negative directional current . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase difference between the friction coefficient and the symmetric potential is sensitive to direction of the net current . even in a symmetric potential and symmetric",
    "fluctuations@xcite a net current can arise .",
    "the current tends to positive direction for @xmath38 and negative direction for @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , our ratchet contains these two driving factor .",
    "it is found that the current reversals may occur when a negative driving factor meets a positive driving factor : case a ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 see fig.3 , fig.5 ) , case b ( @xmath26 and @xmath37 see fig.6 , fig.7 ) , while no current reversals occur when the two negative ( positive ) driving factors meet : case c ( @xmath26 and @xmath32 see fig .",
    "4 ) , case d ( @xmath31 and @xmath37 ) .    in a word , in our symmetric potential ratchet , @xmath39 is the necessary condition for current reversals , the particle never changes its moving direction under the condition of @xmath40 and even no current occur under the condition of @xmath41 .",
    "in present paper , the transport of a brownian particle moving in spatially symmetric potential in the presence of an asymmetric unbiased fluctuation is investigated .",
    "the current of the ratchet is discussed for different cases .",
    "we find that the mutual interplay between the opposite driving factors is the necessary term for current reversals .",
    "we find current reversal , both as a function of temperature as well as the amplitude of rocking force , when the force is adiabatic and the potential is symmetry .",
    "the phenomena of current reversals may be interest in biology , e. g. , when considering the motion of macromolecules .",
    "it is known that the two current reversals effect allows one pair of motor proteins to move simultaneously in opposite directions along the microtubule inside the eucariotic cells .",
    "to summarize , it is remarkable that the interplay of asymmetric unbiased fluctuation , in homogeneous friction and thermal noise with spatially symmetric potential generates such a rich variety of cooperation effects as up to current reversals with temperature as well as the rocking forcing .",
