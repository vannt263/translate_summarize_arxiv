    "in recent works  @xcite the authors establish an interesting connection between billiards and some problems from symplectic geometry and convex geometry .",
    "namely , with the help of the billiard approach they reduce the famous mahler conjecture ( see  @xcite ) to viterbo s conjecture from symplectic geometry .",
    "let an @xmath0-dimensional real vector space @xmath1 be endowed with a norm with unit ball @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is polar to a convex body @xmath4 ) .",
    "we denote such norm by @xmath5 , mind the nonstandard notation and interchange of the original space and its dual . by definition , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the canonical bilinear form of the duality between @xmath1 and @xmath8 . here",
    "we assume that @xmath9 contains the origin ( although this can be relaxed to some extent ) , but is not necessarily centrally symmetric . therefore the norm may be non - symmetric , in general , @xmath10 .",
    "we call such norms _ flat finsler norms _ to distinguish them from the symmetric case .",
    "the connection between symplectic capacities and billiards is that @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the so called hofer ",
    "zehnder symplectic capacity and @xmath13 denotes the length of the shortest closed billiard trajectory in a convex body @xmath14 with geometry of lengths given by a convex body @xmath4 and its norm @xmath5 in @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we measure lengths in @xmath1 using the norm @xmath15 and the billiard reflection rule is given by locally minimizing the length functional .",
    "we say that a polygonal line @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 ) has a _ billiard reflection _ at the point @xmath18 if the functional @xmath19 has a local minimum at the point @xmath20 under the constraint @xmath21 . if @xmath18 belongs to the smooth piece of @xmath22 we say that a _ classical _ billiard reflection occurs .",
    "in such a case one can rewrite the reflection rule in the differential form : @xmath23 here we define the momenta @xmath24 before and after the reflection so that a velocity @xmath25 can be found by the formula ( @xmath26 denotes the differential ) @xmath27 in order to have such a formula , we add a requirement that @xmath28 belongs to the smooth piece of @xmath29 . also here",
    "we define the outer normal to the body @xmath30 at a point @xmath21 as @xmath31 in the rest of this section we assume the bodies @xmath30 and @xmath9 smooth so that velocities and normals are well - defined , although later we will be able to work with arbitrary convex bodies with some caution .",
    "following  @xcite , we use bezdeks approach characterizing shortest closed billiard trajectories ( see also the original paper  @xcite ) .",
    "the approach is that instead of finding the shortest closed billiard trajectory in @xmath30 we can search for the shortest polygonal line that can not be translated into @xmath32 .",

    "we construct the polygonal lines @xmath184 and @xmath185 in the similar manner .",
    "it remains to check its simplicity .",
    "let us examine carefully the change in the momenta .",
    "the geometry of @xmath146 implies the following : if we consider the piece of the trajectory from the point @xmath107 to a certain point @xmath186 and also consider its projections on the first @xmath149 coordinates and on the last @xmath150 coordinates then the length of this piece ( measured with the norm with unit body @xmath146 ) is equal to each of the projections lengths ( measured with the norm unit bodies @xmath101 and @xmath187 ) .",
    "apply this observation to the entire momentum polygonal line in @xmath146 and note that @xmath174 is its projection on the first @xmath149 coordinates .",
    "indeed , the removed momenta of the second type would change nothing in the projections : if in the chain @xmath188 the middle momentum is of the second type it means that the projection @xmath189 lies inside the segment @xmath190 $ ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath185 is the projection of the entire momentum polygonal line on the last @xmath150 coordinates .",
    "so , assume that the polygonal line @xmath173 bypasses the same route @xmath191 times , then induction hypothesis implies that its length equals @xmath192 ( if the norm unit body is @xmath116 ) . then symmetry  [ equation : symmetry ] yields that the length of @xmath174 also equals @xmath192 ( if the norm unit body is @xmath146 ) ; hence the source momentum polygonal line @xmath193 has the length @xmath192 and other its projection @xmath185 has the length @xmath192 too .",
    "therefore , the both projection were passed @xmath191 times and the source polygonal line was passed @xmath191 times also .",
    "the source polygonal line was chosen simple , hence @xmath194 .",
    "that s why the length @xmath173 equals @xmath195 .",
    "similarly , the length of @xmath196 equals @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , the length of @xmath144 equals 4 , as required .",
    "further , by induction hypothesis there are @xmath198 momenta of the first type and @xmath199 momenta of the second type in the polygonal line @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , the period of the simple billiard trajectory in the configuration @xmath129 equals exactly @xmath201 .    at last , to show central symmetry we examine momenta behavior again . as was shown before",
    ", the length @xmath202 equals 4 , and the length @xmath193 also equals 4 . recall that the length of the piece of momentum trajectory from @xmath107 to some point @xmath186 is equal to the lengths of the both projections on the first @xmath149 coordinates and on the last @xmath150 coordinates .",
    "one can set @xmath203 and see that this observation together with induction hypothesis implies @xmath204 .",
    "this reasoning can be applied starting from any point @xmath103 so central symmetry of the momentum trajectory is proven . also ,",
    "the arguments above imply that the momenta @xmath103 and @xmath205 have the same type so in the procedure of the `` thinning '' of @xmath173 the contracted links can be divided into pairs ( on the distance of @xmath0 links between each other ) .",
