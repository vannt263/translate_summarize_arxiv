    "exact solutions of einstein s field equations describing stationary or static axially symmetric configurations of matter are of great astrophysical interest , since the natural shape of an isolated self - gravitating fluid is axially symmetric . in particular , disk - like solutions can be used as models of galaxies and accretion disks .",
    "solutions for static thin disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static thin disks with or without radial pressure have been obtained by different authors @xcite@xcite .",
    "thin rotating disks that can be considered as a source of the kerr metric were presented by bik and ledvinka @xcite , while rotating disks with heat flow were studied by gonzlez and letelier @xcite . also thin disks with radial tension @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite and magnetic and electric fields @xcite were considered .",
    "the nonlinear superposition of a disk and a black hole was first obtained by lemos and letelier @xcite .",
    "perfect fluid disks with halos @xcite and charged perfect fluid disks @xcite were studied by vogt and letelier .",
    "the stability of some general relativistic thin disk models using a first order perturbation of the energy - momentum tensor was investigated by ujevic and letelier @xcite . for a survey on self gravitating relativistic disks ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .    even though in a first approximation thin disks can be used as useful models , in more realistic models the thickness of the disk should be considered .",
    "the addition of a new dimension may change the dynamical properties of the disk source , e.  g. , its stability .",
    "thick static relativistic disks in various coordinate systems were presented by gonzlez and letelier @xcite and vogt and letelier @xcite .",
    "general relativistic versions of some well known newtonian three - dimensional galactic potential - density pairs were studied by vogt and letelier @xcite .    in the works cited above an inverse style method",
    "was used to solve the einstein equations , i.  e. , the energy - momentum tensor is computed from the metric representing the disk . another approach to generate disks is by solving the einstein equations given a source ( energy - momentum tensor ) .",
    "essentialy , they are obtained by solving a riemann - hilbert problem and are highly nontrivial .",
    "this has been used by a german group to generate several exact solutions of disks @xcite@xcite .",
    "recently cooperstock and tieu @xcite devised a new approach to modelling galactic dynamics via general relativity .",
    "a galaxy is idealised as an axially symmetric uniform rotating fluid without pressure ( dust ) .",
    "the authors show that the density distribution of the galaxy is related to the rotation parameter in a nonlinear way , and then show that several measured rotation curves for galaxies are consistent with the mass distribution of matter in flattened disks , therefore excluding the need for a massive halo of dark matter .",
    "however , their model has been criticized by some authors @xcite . in particular ,",
    "korzyski @xcite has argued that the model possesses an additional singular rotating thin disk at @xmath0 and vogt and letelier @xcite have shown that this singular disk is made of exotic matter either like cosmic strings or struts with negative energy density .",
    "balasin and grumiller @xcite , using a somewhat different mathematical formulation , have shown that is possible to obtain flat rotation curves without unphysical sources at @xmath0 , but in turn distributional sources may arise on the @xmath1-axis . motivated by cooperstock and tieu s work , we investigate the properties of _ thick _ rotating disks immersed in rotating dust obtained by using the inverse style method ( image method ) .",

    "using the van stockum class of metrics that describe spacetimes with stationary axially symmetric distributions of dust , and applying the `` displace , cut , fill and reflect '' method , we constructed thick rotating disks surrounded by rotating dust .",
    "in general the disks have equal radial pressures and tensions in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "the solution found by bonnor @xcite and a sum of a `` monopole '' and `` quadrupole '' solution were used to study particular models of rotating disks .",
    "they were found to have annular regions with negative energy density and azimuthal pressure .",
    "heat flow is concentrated near the plane @xmath0 and is present in most of the radial extension of the disk .",
    "these particular examples suggest that the `` displace , cut , fill and reflect '' method used on the van stockum class of metrics will generate disks with some unrealistic physical properties and thus are hardly useful in galactic modelling .",
    "however , the aplication of the above mentioned method to solutions obtained using a different approach ( see , for instance , @xcite ) may result in more realistic and useful models .",
    "in the thin limit we obtain disks with heat flow everywhere and composed of exotic matter with an equation of state @xmath102 , which may be interpreted as an equation of state of cosmic strings or struts .",
    "we also comment the new galactic model proposed by cooperstock and tieu @xcite and the presence of an additional singular layer of exotic matter in their model .",
