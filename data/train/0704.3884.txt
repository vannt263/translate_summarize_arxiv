    "we present the asteroseismic analysis of a new data set comprising photometry of the old open cluster m67  ( ngc  2682 ) from nine telescopes during a 43-day campaign with a total of 100 telescope nights ( stello et al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "the main goal of the campaign was to detect oscillations in the stars on the giant branch ( stello et al .  2007 ; hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "here we analyse the variability of the blue straggler ( bs ) population .",
    "bs stars are defined as being bluer and more luminous than the turn - off stars in their parent cluster , and they are found in all open and globular clusters where dedicated searches have been made .",
    "bss are important objects since they are directly linked to the interaction between stellar evolution of binaries and the cluster dynamics . in the cores of globular clusters",
    "the stellar density is high and direct stellar collisions may explain the existence of some of the bs stars @xcite .",
    "however , in open clusters the density of stars is much lower and stellar collisions are rare @xcite .",
    "bss in open clusters are therefore generally thought to be formed as the gradual coalescence of binary stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a simulation of m67  that took into account stellar and binary star evolution , in addition to the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "their simulation showed that around half of the bss were formed from primordial binary systems and the other half from binary stars that had been perturbed by close encounters with other stars .     and @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "the solid line is an isochrone for an age of 4  gyr .",
    "the locations of ew  cnc and ex  cnc have been marked with boxes and six other blue stragglers in the instability strip ( dashed lines ) are marked with filled circles .",
    "[ fig : cmd],width=332 ]    while several of the known bss in clusters are located near the main sequence inside the classical instability strip , only around @xmath2% show @xmath0  scuti  pulsations @xcite .",
    "these objects are particularly interesting because their masses can in principle be inferred from comparison with pulsation models .",
    "@xcite studied the variable bss in the globular cluster 47tuc , and could determine the mass of one of them to within @xmath3% from a comparison with models in the petersen diagram .",
    "we have made a search for oscillations in eight bs stars in the instability strip in m67  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have studied the two known variable bs stars ew  cnc and ex  cnc .",
    "the @xmath0  scuti  pulsations in these stars were discovered by @xcite and pulsation modelling was done in detail by @xcite .",
    "the current data set has a significantly higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) than the previous studies @xcite and a superior spectral window .",
    "we have for the first time unambiguously detected a very large number of frequencies , comparable in number to the recent ambitious campaigns on field @xmath0  scuti  stars like fg  virginis @xcite .",
    "we characterize ew  cnc and ex  cnc using a grid of seismic models , but unlike @xcite we also include the effects of rotation ( in both equilibrium models and seismic oscillations ) .",
    "rotation will affect the internal structure of the stars , induce mixing processes @xcite , and cause significant asymmetric splitting of multiplets even in these moderately rapid rotating stars @xcite .",

    "the horizontal bars labeled `` a '' in fig .  [ fig : nmode ] indicate where most observed frequencies are found . in these frequency intervals",
    "we estimate that we have detected @xmath40@xmath41% of the modes in ew  cnc and @xmath42@xmath43% in ex  cnc .",
    "these results rely on the assumptions that the considered ranges in mass and @xmath13  are realistic and that only @xmath44 modes have detectable amplitudes .         to further investigate the distribution of peaks and search for recurring patterns we computed autocorrelations for the frequencies from the observations and the pulsation models .",
    "this method can in principle be used to extract important quantities for asteroseismic modelling like the large and small separation and rotational splitting .",
    "this would enable us to constrain the mass and temperature of the stars .",
    "since we have no information about the relative amplitudes of the theoretical frequencies , each frequency is represented by a gaussian of unit height and with a fwhm equal to twice the formal frequency resolution of the data set . to be able to compare the autocorrelations of the observed and theoretical frequencies , we follow the same procedure for the observations , ie .  only using the frequencies and not the observed amplitudes .",
    "we use the frequencies from the regions where the majority of the frequencies are observed .",

    "the results for ex  cnc shows the large separation at @xmath45@xmath12hz  for the model with high mass , while for the less massive model there is a low peak at twice the large separation ( see _ top _",

    "there is an intriguing similarity between the autocorrelation of the observed frequencies in ex  cnc and the model with high mass ( the _ middle _  and _ bottom _  _ right _  _ panels _  in fig .",
    "[ fig : autoexcnc ] ) .",
    "however , we are extremely cautious not to over - interpret the only marginally significant autocorrelation peaks at 2 , 6 , 12 , and 24@xmath12hz .    although there appears to be qualitative agreement between the observations and the theoretical models , we can not at this stage use the method to determine which combination of mass , evolutionary stage , or rotational velocity best describes the observations . to make progress and make",
    "a detailed comparison of the observed frequencies with theoretical models would require that we have identified at least some of the dominant modes .",
    "this can be achieved from the study of line - profile variations or from comparison of phase shifts of the frequencies in different photometric filters @xcite .",
    "we can not apply the latter method since most of our observations were done in the @xmath1 band with only a few nights of data in @xmath8 .",
    "we have analysed a new photometric data set of eight bs stars in m67 . only in the two known variable stars ew  cnc and ex  cnc",
    "do we find @xmath0  scuti  pulsations .",
    "we detect 41 frequencies in ew  cnc and 26 frequencies in ex  cnc .",
    "compared to the previous multisite campaign by @xcite we have detected four times as many frequencies in these two stars , and the number of frequencies is comparable to the best - studied field @xmath0  scuti  stars .",
    "the frequencies with the highest amplitudes in ex  cnc are separated by roughly 1cd@xmath19  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : amp2 ] ) and our extensive multisite data are therefore essential to study the pulsations in this star .",
    "we have made simulations of the light curves which show that the frequencies are recovered in all cases ( see appendix  [ sec : vogtere ] ) .",
    "we repeated the fourier analyses on subsets of the data to confirm that the same frequencies were extracted .",
    "thus , we claim that the observed pattern can not be due to the spectral window , but represents a real property of the distribution of frequencies in ex  cnc . additional support for this claim is the fact that a similar pattern is not seen in ew  cnc .",
    "we computed a grid of theoretical pulsation models that take the effects of rotation into account , which were not included in earlier models @xcite .",
    "we find general agreement between the observed and computed frequencies when comparing their distribution in histograms .",
    "we can claim to have detected non - radial modes and in the range where most of the frequencies are observed , and at least @xmath40% and @xmath42% of all low - degree ( @xmath44 ) modes are excited in ew  cnc and ex  cnc , respectively .",
    "this is perhaps the most important result of the current study , since in the past decade of observational work on @xmath0  scuti  stars only a tiny fraction of the frequencies expected from theoretical models were in fact detected .",
    "a reasonable explanation is that high s / n and good frequency resolution is needed to be able detect the weakest modes as was suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation of the observed frequencies does not show any significant peaks in any of the stars .",
    "however , autocorrelations of the frequencies from theoretical pulsation models show that if indeed modes with degree @xmath46 , and @xmath39 are observed , we can not expect to unambiguously detect the large separation from such an analysis .",
    "this result was obtained while assuming that all amplitudes are equal , since no amplitude information is available for the theoretical models .    to improve on the interpretation of the rich frequency spectra of ew  cnc and ex  cnc , and other well - observed @xmath0  scuti  stars in general , we see two possibilities :    * on the theoretical side , it would be very helpful to have estimates of the amplitudes of the modes .",
    "if relative amplitudes could be reliably estimated from theory the autocorrelation might be a useful method for measuring the separation between radial modes and hence constrain the density of @xmath0  scuti  stars .",
    "* on the observational side we need to be able to identify the degrees of at least the main modes .",
    "this can in principle be done by comparison of phases and amplitude ratios for different narrow - band filters as has been attempted for other @xmath0  scuti  stars @xcite .",
    "we have too few observations in the @xmath8 filter to follow the latter suggestion , and multi - filter ( eg .  strmgren @xmath47 ) observations should be considered for similar campaigns in the future .",
    "the points mentioned here also apply when planning ground - based support for the corot @xcite and kepler @xcite satellite missions .",
    "these missions will provide photometric time series with long temporal coverage of several @xmath0  scuti  stars , but only in a single filter .    on request we would gladly provide the light curves presented here .",

    "we made a fourier analysis of each simulation as we did for the observed data ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : finalwei ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : recover ] we show how often each inserted frequency was recovered in the simulations versus s / n .",
    "the _ top _  and _ bottom _  _ panels _  are for ew  cnc and ex  cnc , respectively . in each panel open and solid symbols correspond to cases a and b ( sect .  [ sec : finalwei ] ) . for ew",
    "cnc it is seen that in both case  a and b all frequencies with s / n@xmath100 are recovered .",
    "we prefer case  b for ew  cnc since it has a significantly lower residual noise level ( see table  [ tab : noise ] ) . for ex  cnc we chose case",
    "a because it shows a much better recovery rate than case  b.      the uncertainties on frequency , amplitude , and phase given in tables  [ tab : s1280 ] and [ tab : s1284 ] are computed from the _ rms _ scatter in the simulations .",
    "we plot the uncertainties versus  the amplitude for ew  cnc ( case  b ) and ex  cnc ( case  a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : uncertain ] .",
    "the dashed lines are theoretical lower estimates of the uncertainties using the expressions from @xcite which are valid for uncorrelated noise , ie .  for data with only a white noise component . for real data one must multiply the uncertainty by the square root of the estimated correlation length @xcite .",
    "we found this by calculating the autocorrelation of the residual amplitude spectrum after the mean value has been subtracted .",
    "the intersection of the autocorrelation function with zero is a measure of the correlation length , @xmath101 . for both ew  cnc and ex  cnc",
    "we find @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting estimates of the uncertainties are marked by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : uncertain ] .         in general we find an acceptable agreement with the estimated uncertainties from @xcite . for most parameters the estimated uncertainties are too low , especially so for the frequencies and phases in ex  cnc .",
    "this is likely because the frequencies lie closer in ex  cnc compared to ew  cnc .",
    "the uncertainties on the amplitudes in ew  cnc are close to the estimate for uncorrelated noise .",
