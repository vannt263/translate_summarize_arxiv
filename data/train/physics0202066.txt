    "in the present paper we demonstrate that , in addition to dipole plasmon excitations multipole plasmons ( quadrupole , octupole , etc ) contribute to the multiphoton excitation process , which results in a significant difference of plasmon resonance profiles between the cross sections for multiphoton and single - photon absorption . we have developed a formalism from which the cross sections for multiphoton excitation can be worked out . the balance between multipole surface and volume plasmon contributions",
    "is analyzed .",
    "our results are obtained within a theoretical model for the multiphoton excitation of a jellium cluster .",
    "this model is applicable to metal clusters , to fullerenes and to any type of cluster in which a strong delocalization of valence atomic orbitals takes place .",
    "the theoretical formalism we have developed is not confined in its application to photons .",
    "it can also be used to describe any kind of higher order plasmon excitation processes , for example those which arise by multiple scattering of electrons within the cluster .",
    "recently , a number of papers have discussed metallic clusters @xcite and fullerenes @xcite in strong laser fields .",
    "the theoretical approach usually followed is to solve a time - dependent local density equation numerically ( lda or local - density approximation ) , and the regime most commonly studied involves intense , short laser pulses , for which the turn - on and turn - off properties significantly affect excitation .",
    "we report here on a different problem : our initial interest lies in lower laser powers , for which multiphoton excitation just begins to intrude , and we are interested in developing a formalism to describe the interaction between collective modes and a laser field in the multiphoton regime . for this purpose , a semiclassical model , in which the collective flow of charge is driven by a periodic field ,",
    "is established , and we relate it to the multiphoton absorption cross section of the cluster , which takes account of quantum mechanics . of course , one can in principle extend this treatment to consider the turn - on and turn - off of laser pulses , to treat the interaction numerically for various power levels and initial charge distributions .",
    "what we wish to point out , however , is a novel feature , which arises even for an infinite wavetrain interacting with a cluster ( the simplest and most fundamental problem ) : multiple plasmon excitations are driven by multiphoton excitations . in the present paper , we explain by what mechanism this arises .",
    "our approach is based on different principles from the lda . instead of using the kohn - sham formalism",
    ", we propose a hydrodynamic approach . in the lda",
    ", all quantities are made to depend solely on charge density , and currents are subsequently made to appear by solving a time - dependent equation . in our approach , we start out from the continuity equation and the euler equation , from which both the current flow and the density are obtained in a completely consistent way .",
    "our theory is local , and does not include exchange . in principle , it would be possible to extend it by building in exchange and correlations in a similar way to the lda .",
    "one of the benefits of our approach is that all the momentum transfer terms are included in the formulation , which leads to the presence of both volume and surface plasmon terms . if one wishes to simplify the theory , it is possible towards the end of the calculation to assume zero momentum transfer , in which case the volume plasmon terms disappear from the problem .",
    "surface plasmon excitations are well known in atomic cluster physics .",
    "the dipole surface plasmons are responsible for the formation of giant resonances in photoabsorption spectra of metal clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they also play an important role in inelastic collisions of charged particles with metal clusters @xcite .",
    "the role of surface plasmon excitations in inelastic electron - cluster scattering was thoroughly studied in @xcite , and it was demonstrated that collective excitations make a significant contribution to the electron energy loss spectrum ( eels ) in the region of the surface plasmon resonance . with increasing scattering angle , plasmon excitations of higher angular momenta become more and more prominent .",
    "plasmons are characteristic of delocalised electrons , and therefore the jellium model provides the most appropriate starting point for a discussion of plasmon excitation in the multiphoton regime .",
    "this regime is particularly appropriate for the study of atomic clusters , which are rather fragile objects , and readily explode under very strong irradiation @xcite    the inelastic scattering of fast electrons on metal clusters in the range of transferred energies above the ionization threshold was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that , in this energy range , volume plasmons dominate the contribution to the differential cross section , resulting in a resonance behaviour .",
    "the volume plasmon resonances excited in the cluster during a collision decay via the ionization process . the resonance frequency and the autoionization width of the volume plasmon excitations",
    "have both been determined in @xcite .",
    "the role of the polarization interaction and plasmon excitations in the process of electron attachment to metal clusters has also been examined both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that plasmon excitations induce a resonance enhancement of the electron attachment cross section .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ m_phot ] ,",
    "we derive quantum mechanical expressions for the cross sections of multipole ( quadrupole , octupole etc ) plasmon excitations taking place in the multiphoton absorption regime and estimate the cross sections on the basis of the plasmon resonance approximation .",
    "we present and discuss the multiphoton absorption profiles and demonstrate a significant change of the multiphoton absorption profiles in the cross sections for multiphoton as compared to single - photon absorption . in section [ hydrodyn ] , we establish certain connections of the cross sections with the variation of electron density in the cluster due to the external field and present the formalism for the calculation of the electron density variation in the cluster due to the external field , based on the use of the hydrodynamic euler equation and on the equation of continuity .",
    "we apply the general formalism to the description of fast electron - cluster scattering and multiphoton absorption . in section [ q_mom ]",
    ", we calculate the multipole moments of the system induced by the external field on the basis of the formalism outlined in section [ hydrodyn ] .",
    "we analyse the plasmon resonance structure of the induced multipole moments and conclude that it is analogous to the one arising in the multiphoton absorption cross sections calculated in section [ m_phot ] . in section [ conclu ] ,",
    "we draw conclusions from this work . in [ coll_matr_el ] , we show how matrix elements for collective transitions can be calculated on the basis of the sum rules . in [ integrals ] , we present details of calculations of the angular integrals arising in the formalism outlined here .",
    "first , we consider the cross section for multiphoton absorption in jellium clusters and demonstrate that multipole plasmon excitations are essential to this process .",
    "the discussion in this section is based on the plasmon resonance approximation , which is introduced below .",
    "let us start by considering the simplest example and calculate the cross section for single - photon absorption in the plasmon resonance approximation .",
    "the single - photon absorption cross section in the dipole approximation reads as @xmath0    here , @xmath1 is the charge of electron , @xmath2 is the velocity of light , @xmath3 is planck s constant , @xmath4 is the electron excitation energy , @xmath5 is the photon frequency and @xmath6 is the matrix element of the @xmath7- component of the cluster dipole moment .",
    "the summation over @xmath8 includes all final states of the excited electron , which belong to both the discrete and the continuous spectra .    in the jellium picture , which works reasonably well for metal clusters and to some extent for fullerenes ,",
    "the main contribution to the cross section ( [ sigma_1 ] ) arises from a small group of excited states or sometimes even from a single transition of frequency close to the classical mie resonance frequency  also known as the frequency of the plasmon resonance . for a spherical metal cluster , this frequency",
    "is given by ( see e.g. @xcite and section 4 of this paper ) @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the cluster volume , where @xmath11 is the cluster radius , @xmath12 is the wigner - seitz radius ; @xmath13 is the number of delocalized electrons in a cluster , @xmath14 is the angular momentum of the plasmon mode , @xmath15 is the electron mass . note that , by using a single photon of energy @xmath16 , one can , in practice , excite only @xmath17 dipole plasmon oscillations in a metallic cluster .    for nearly - spherical fullerenes @xmath18 or @xmath19 ,",
    "the plasmon resonance frequency is equal to ( see @xcite ) @xmath20 where @xmath13 is the total number of delocalised electrons ( 4 electrons per atom times the number of carbon atoms in the fullerene molecule ) and @xmath21 is the the radius of the fullerene .",
    "the plasmon resonance approximation is based on the fact that excitations in the vicinity of a plasmon resonance exhaust the sum rule almost completely ( see @xcite ) , which means that the summation in the sum rule ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath22 need be performed only over excited states in the vicinity of the mie resonance .",
    "now , assuming a lorentzian distribution of width @xmath23 for the plasmon resonance states and replacing the delta function , @xmath24 , in ( [ sigma_1 ] ) by the profile ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath25 one recovers the well - known expression for the single - photon absorption cross section ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath26    the width @xmath23 is due to landau damping .",
    "its calculation for metal clusters is performed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the cross section ( [ photo_1 ] ) reproduces correctly the appearence of the plasmon resonances in single - photon absorption spectra of metal clusters and fullerenes , although some details of the experimentally observed profiles are naturally beyond the plasmon resonance approximation .",
    "the discussion of these details is not the scope of the present work .",
    "this can only be done accurately enough on the basis of _ ab initio _ many - body theories .",
    "instead , we analyse the multiphoton absorption cross sections on the basis of the plasmon resonance approximation and elucidate the role of multipole plasmon excitations in its formation , because our interest lie in establishing the physical mechanisms which underpin multiphoton excitation .      in the dipole approximation ,",
    "the two - photon absorption cross section is equal to @xmath27    we evaluate the cross section ( [ sigma_2 ] ) in the same way as for the single - photon case .",
    "the main contribution to the sum over the intermediate states @xmath15 arises from the virtual dipole plasmon excitations",
    ". therefore , one derives @xmath28    here , we have also introduced a dipole plasmon resonance width @xmath23 and used the sum rule ( [ sum_rule ] ) for the evaluation of the matrix elements for the dipole plasmon excitation @xmath29 .",
    "the remaining matrix elements @xmath30 in ( [ estim1 ] ) describe dipole transitions from the dipole plasmon resonance state to other excited states .",
    "matrix elements for these transitions obey the dipole selection rule .",
    "this means that the angular momentum of the final state can only be equal to either @xmath31 or @xmath32 . according to ( [ omega_pl ] ) and ( [ freq_ful ] )",
    ", there is no surface plasmon excitation with @xmath31 either in metal clusters or in fullerenes .",
    "thus , only transitions to the states with @xmath32 are of interest .",
    "these arguments show that , by using two photons simultaneously , one can excite the quadrupole plasmon resonance in a metal cluster or in a fullerene with a frequency given in ( [ omega_pl ] ) and ( [ freq_ful ] ) respectively .",
    "when calculating the cross section ( [ sigma_2 ] ) in the vicinity of the quadrupole plasmon resonance excitation , i.e. at @xmath33 , it is sufficient to consider only transitions to the resonance final state , i.e. to put @xmath34 ( here and below we use indices 1 and 2 to designate the dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonance states ) and to replace the delta function , @xmath35 by a lorentzian distribution of width @xmath36 ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath37    by substituting ( [ estim1 ] ) and ( [ lorentz2 ] ) in ( [ sigma_2 ] ) , one derives    @xmath38    this result demonstrates that the photoabsorption profile in the two - photon process differs substantially from the single - photon case .",
    "the cross section ( [ photo_2a ] ) has a resonance at the dipole plasmon frequency and , in addition , also contains the quadrupole plasmon resonance at @xmath39 .",
    "the cross section ( [ photo_2a ] ) depends on @xmath40 .",
    "the transition matrix element @xmath41 describes the electron transition between the dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonance states .",
    "this is a single electron transition rather than a collective one .",
    "therefore , calculation of @xmath41 on the basis of the sum rule ( [ sum_rule ] ) would lead to a significant overestimate of the value of this matrix element .",
    "instead , one can use heisenberg s uncertainty principle for the evaluation of @xmath41 @xcite . by estimating the radial component of the momentum of a single electron in a dipole and quadrupole plasmon oscillatory mode as @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively ,",
    "one derives @xmath44    here , @xmath45 is a dimensionless constant , of the order of one , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the uncertainties relating to an electron in the dipole and quadrupole plasmon modes respectively , @xmath48 is the width of the domain in the vicinity of the cluster surface within which plasmon excitations take place . in [ coll_matr_el ]",
    "we prove the correctness of this estimate and demonstrate that matrix element @xmath41 is equal to @xmath49    by substituting ( [ z12 ] ) in ( [ photo_2a ] ) , we obtain the final expression for the two - photon absorption cross section : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .    ) and ( [ sigma_2fin ] ) and normalised per unit atom .",
    "the two - photon absorption profile is scaled by a factor 1/100 .",
    "the scales are not identical for the two curves for reasons of definition of the cross sections in the single- and two - photon cases , but both are given in atomic units . ]",
    "we note that the cross section ( [ sigma_2fin ] ) depends explicitly on planck s constant @xmath3 , while the cross section ( [ photo_1 ] ) does not .",
    "the independence of ( [ photo_1 ] ) from @xmath3 is connected with the fact that plasmon oscillations are a purely classical effect , while the dependence of ( [ sigma_2fin ] ) on @xmath3 arises from the interaction between dipole and quadrupole plasmon modes as can be seen from estimate ( [ estim2 ] ) and the explicit expression ( [ z12 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that it is meaningful to treat plasmon excitations classically , while the coupling of various plasmon modes in the multiphoton photoabsorption process must be treated beyond purely classical theory .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the cross section profiles per unit atom for single - photon ( dashed line ) and two - photon ( solid line ) absorption calculated according to ( [ photo_1 ] ) and ( [ sigma_2fin ] ) .",
    "these profiles do not depend on the number of atoms in the cluster .",
    "note that the scales are not the same for the two curves for reasons of definition of the cross sections in the single- and two - photon cases , but are both given in atomic units .",
    "the peak in the single - photon plot gives the location of the dipole resonance .",
    "the other peak in the two - photon plot is the quadrupole resonance .",
    "this figure demonstrates a significant difference between the nature of the profiles , arising from the presence of quadrupole plasmon excitation in the two - photon case . in this calculation",
    "we have input @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the choice of these parameters can be different for different clusters , but it should always lead to qualitatively similar single- and two - photon absorption profiles .",
    "an accurate determination of the parameters is only possible on the basis of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the formalism we have developed can also be used for the evaluation of the multiphoton absorption cross sections for a larger number of photons . in the dipole approximation",
    "the n - photon absorption cross section has the following form : @xmath56 here the amplitude @xmath57 is equal to @xmath58    the plasmon resonance structure of the multiphoton absorption cross section ( [ m_k ] ) can be analysed in a similar way to the previous treatments for the single- and two - photon cases .",
    "this analysis immediately leads to the important conclusion that plasmon resonances with larger angular momenta ( octupole , etc ) can be excited in the multiphoton absorption regime .",
    "thus , for example , with three photons , the octupole plasmon resonance at @xmath59 will also be excited .",
    "this analysis , however , leaves undefined the matrix elements for electronic transitions between various plasmon modes .",
    "estimates of these can be performed either on the basis of heisenberg s uncertainty principle or by a calculation similar to the one for @xmath60 ( see ( [ z12 ] ) and ( [ photo_2a ] ) ) in the two - photon case , but their accurate evaluation is not trivial .",
    "note that the plasmon resonance approximation allows one to analyse only the plasmon resonance excitations that are characterised by relatively low angular momenta , because electron excitations in the cluster with large angular momenta @xmath14 have single - particle character .",
    "this follows , for instance , from the fact that with increasing @xmath14 the wave length of the surface plasmon mode , @xmath61 , becomes smaller than the characteristic wave length of the delocalised electrons at the fermi surface , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the characteristic electron excitation energy in the cluster . in other words , excitations with angular momenta comparable with the characteristic electron angular momenta of the ground state exhibit single - particle rather than collective character",
    "therefore , when analyzing contributions of the plasmon resonance modes to the multiphoton absorption cross section , one should consider only the lowest angular momenta .",
    "for example according to the jellium model , the maximum angular momentum of the delocalised electrons in the @xmath64 cluster is equal to 4 .",
    "therefore , only dipole and quadrupole collective modes can be expected in this case .",
    "with increasing cluster size the number of essential plasmon modes grows as @xmath21 .",
    "the multipole plasmon resonances arising in the multiphoton absorption cross sections , should also appear in other physical characteristics of the cluster , which can be probed in the multiphoton absorption regime .",
    "in the situation where plasmon resonance excitations are the dominant contribution to the multiphoton absorption cross section , it is natural to seek and analyse the plasmon resonance structure of the variation of electron density induced by the radiation field .",
    "the variation of electron density is a characteristic of the system , allowing one easily to connect classical and quantum descriptions of the excitation process , because charge density variation has the same meaning in both quantum and classical mechanics .",
    "a classical description of the electron density variation in a cluster is appropriate in the situation where plasmon excitations dominate over the single - particle spectrum , because plasmon oscillations in clusters are an essentially classical effect .",
    "since our object of interest is the excitation of plasmons in metallic clusters , which have a distinctly classical nature , we now describe the collective motion of the electron density using euler s equation and the equation of continuity .",
    "euler s equation couples the acceleration of the electron density @xmath65 with the total local electric field @xmath66 acting on the density at the point @xmath67 .",
    "it has the following form : @xmath68 the electric field @xmath66 includes both the external field acting on the cluster and the polarization contribution arising from the variation of electron density .",
    "expressing the total derivative on the left hand side of ( [ euler1 ] ) as the sum of two contributions , arising from the change in velocity of the electron density in time and in space , one obtains :    @xmath69    here @xmath70 is the potential of the external field .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of ( [ euler2 ] ) describes the polarization force due to the variation of electron density @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that the external potential @xmath70 is the solution of the wave equation .",
    "therefore , we can put @xmath72 where @xmath70 satisfies the equation @xmath73 here @xmath74 , @xmath2 is the velocity of light , but in principle one can postulate a more complex dispersion law .",
    "we need consider only the positive frequency solution of the wave equation , because the formalism for the negative frequency solution is analogous to it .",
    "the total electron density in the cluster is equal to @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the electron density distribution in a free cluster without an external field and @xmath71 is the variation of electron density caused by the external field and the polarization force acting together .",
    "the motion of electron density in the cluster obeys the equation of continuity , which reads : @xmath77    the simultaneous solution of equations ( [ euler2 ] ) , ( [ density ] ) and ( [ eq_cont ] ) with appropriate initial conditions and the initial distribution @xmath76 allow one to determine the variation of electron density @xmath71 as well as its velocity @xmath78 .",
    "we solve this problem by using a perturbative approach on the external field @xmath70 .",
    "it is easy to estimate the relative value of the first and the second terms on the left hand side of ( [ euler2 ] ) .",
    "we see that the second term is negligible , provided the condition @xmath79 is fulfilled .",
    "substituting here the characteristic values @xmath80 , @xmath81 , one derives @xmath82 in atomic units or @xmath83 .",
    "below , we assume that this condition is fulfilled and neglect the second term on the left hand side of ( [ euler2 ] ) , which means physically that the external field causes only a small spatial inhomogeneity in the electron density distribution within the cluster . in this limit , euler s equation reduces to a newtonian equation , which describes electronic motion in the cluster under the action of the external field and the polarization force .",
    "we express the solutions of ( [ euler2 ] ) and ( [ eq_cont ] ) in the following form : @xmath84 @xmath85    by substituting these expansions into ( [ euler2 ] ) , ( [ eq_cont ] ) and performing simple transformations , one derives @xmath86",
    "@xmath87    here @xmath88 is the kroneker symbol .",
    "one can exclude @xmath89 from equation ( [ rho_n_1 ] ) by the substitution of ( [ v_n ] ) in ( [ rho_n_1 ] ) . performing this transformation with the simultaneous use of ( [ varphi_r ] ) and @xmath90 ,",
    "one derives the following equation : @xmath91    the left hand side of equation ( [ rho_n ] ) describes eigen - oscillations of the electron density .",
    "the electron density is almost constant within the cluster but varies rapidly near the cluster surface .",
    "therefore , the terms proportional to @xmath76 and @xmath92 on the left hand side of ( [ rho_n ] ) determine the square of the frequency of the volume and surface plasmon oscillations respectively .",
    "the right hand side in ( [ rho_n ] ) describes a driving force acting on the eigen- plasmon oscillations .",
    "the set of non - linear equations ( [ v_n ] ) and ( [ rho_n ] ) must be solved iteratively .",
    "it is clear from the form of the equations that the index @xmath8 corresponds to the order of perturbation theory on the external field @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath94 equation ( [ rho_n ] ) reduces to @xmath95 and , for @xmath96 , one derives @xmath97    equations ( [ rho_n1 ] ) and ( [ rho_n_2 ] ) show that the variation @xmath98 describes the linear response of the electron subsystem to the the external field @xmath93 , while @xmath99 arises only in the second order of perturbation theory on @xmath93 , because @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    solving the set of equations ( [ v_n ] ) and ( [ rho_n ] ) with @xmath93 describing the dipole electron - photon interaction up to the @xmath8-th order",
    ", one can calculate the variation of electron density in the cluster caused by the field of @xmath8 photons .",
    "the set of equations ( [ v_n ] ) and ( [ rho_n ] ) is not confined in its application to photons .",
    "it can also be used to describe the dynamics of electron density under the action of any kind of external field , for example the electric field of a charged projectile colliding with the cluster . indeed , by considering the partial spherical harmonic of the fourier image of the coulomb field of the projectile particle",
    ", one can derive from ( [ rho_n1 ] ) the same expression for the variation of the electron density @xmath102 as follows from the purely electrodynamical perturbative approach to the electron scattering problem @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ v_n ] ) and ( [ rho_n ] ) are valid for an arbitrary shape of the initial distribution @xmath103 . in the spherical case , the angular parts in ( [ v_n ] ) and ( [ rho_n ] ) can be separated .",
    "thus , the cross section for @xmath8-photon absorption can in principle be extracted for arbitrarily large n , although the calculations become more and more tedious the higher @xmath8 is .",
    "let us consider this formalism in more detail .    in the case of the spherically symmetric initial distribution",
    ", one can put @xmath104 .",
    "this relationship allows one easily to exclude angular variables from equation ( [ rho_n ] ) . using this relationship together with the partial expansion for @xmath105 and @xmath93 , @xmath106 @xmath107 one derives @xmath108    here",
    ", @xmath109 is the sperical harmonic corresponding to the angular momentum @xmath14 and the projection of the angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "when deriving ( [ rho_n_partial1 ] ) , we have multiplied both sides of equation ( [ rho_n ] ) by the sperical harmonic @xmath110 and then integrated over @xmath111 .",
    "we also used the well known expansion ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath112 where function @xmath113 is defined as follows @xmath114 here @xmath115 is the step function . in equation ( [ rho_n_partial1 ] ) we have introduced the function @xmath116 , which is of the the form @xmath117 when deriving ( [ rho_n_partial1 ] ) , we have also made obvious transformations of the sum over @xmath118 on the right hand side of equation ( [ rho_n ] ) using ( [ varphi_r ] ) and ( [ v_n ] ) . note that the sum over @xmath119 in ( [ rho_n_partial1 ] ) still contains the integrals over the angular variables",
    "the integration over the angular variables in the sum is straightforward , but somewhat cumbersome .",
    "it is also clear that the non - gradient terms in the sum contain the integration of the product of three spherical harmonics , if one expands @xmath120 and @xmath93 according to ( [ partial_dens ] ) and ( [ partial_varphi ] ) , which we denote as @xmath121    the gradient terms in the sum contain the integration of a spherical harmonic multiplied by the scalar product of the two vector spherical harmonics : @xmath122    this type of integral arises , when one expresses the gradients of the potential and the density according to ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath123 @xmath124    here @xmath125 , @xmath126 are , respectively , the longitudinal and the transverse vector spherical harmonics , the definition of which one can find in @xcite .",
    "we mention some properties of these vector hamonics : @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the potential @xmath130 in ( [ grad_phi ] ) is as follows @xmath131    since the explicit expressions for @xmath132 and @xmath133 are somewhat lengthy , they are presented in [ integrals ] .    using the formulae written above",
    ", one can easily rewrite ( [ rho_n_partial1 ] ) in the following form @xmath134    here and below , we assume that the summation over @xmath135 and @xmath136 is performed with the same limits as in ( [ partial_dens ] ) and ( [ partial_varphi ] )",
    ".      we now analyse equation ( [ rho_nlm ] ) and demonstrate that it describes both surface and volume plasmon oscillations .",
    "the surface and volume solutions of ( [ rho_nlm ] ) can be separated from each other , if one assumes that the initial distribution of electron density has the form @xmath137 here @xmath13 is the total number of delocalized electrons in the cluster volume @xmath138 .    in this case",
    "it is natural to look for the solution of ( [ rho_nlm ] ) by expressing it in the following form @xmath139    in ( [ rho_ini ] ) and ( [ delta_rho ] ) we have introduced the two radii @xmath140 and @xmath141 and assumed that @xmath142 , but @xmath143 , where @xmath21 is the cluster radius .",
    "such a relationship is necessary for the elimination of the uncertainties , which arise in ( [ delta_rho ] ) and the subsequent formulae in the vicinity of the cluster radius .",
    "substituting ( [ rho_ini ] ) and ( [ delta_rho ] ) in ( [ rho_nlm ] ) , performing straighforward but lengthy calculations of the integrals , one derives the following equation @xmath144    when deriving ( [ rho_nlm_fin ] ) , we have used the fact that @xmath145 .",
    "also we have introduced the function @xmath146    the left hand side of equation ( [ rho_nlm_fin ] ) describes volume and surface eigen - oscillations of the electron density characterised by the angular momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the surface plasmon resonance frequency @xmath147 is the same as in ( [ omega_pl ] ) .",
    "the volume plasmon resonance frequency is equal to @xmath148 in equation ( [ rho_nlm_fin ] ) , @xmath149 appears in expressions involving @xmath14 , but is nevertheless is independent of @xmath14 , as one sees in equation ( [ vol_freq ] ) .",
    "the physical reason for this is that the volume plasmon oscillation is degenerate with @xmath14 .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ rho_nlm_fin ] ) describes a driving force acting on the eigen - plasmon oscillations .",
    "surface and volume terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ rho_nlm_fin ] ) have not been regrouped , in order to stress their correspondencce with terms in ( [ rho_nlm ] ) .",
    "it is seen from ( [ rho_nlm_fin ] ) that equations for the volume and surface plasmon oscillations can be separated and will then read as follows : @xmath150    @xmath151    the set of non - linear equations ( [ rho_nlm_vol ] ) and ( [ rho_nlm_surf ] ) must be solved iteratively starting from @xmath94 .",
