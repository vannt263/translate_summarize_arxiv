    "quasicrystals are characterized by remarkable transport properties ( e.g. low conductivities @xmath0 with @xmath1 or disorder ) which are generally attributed to the complicated interplay between the electrons and the peculiar atomic structure @xcite .",
    "some of these have been related to the electronic properties found in 2d or 3d theoretical models ( critical states , spiky singular density of states , anomalous transport ... ) @xcite .",
    "one dimensional models of quasiperiodic structures share all these features , in addition to other properties as the occurrence of a zero measure spectrum .",
    "thus , despite their lack of direct physical interest , they are worth studying since properties which can only be illustrated numerically in higher dimensions , and thus sometimes lack a direct justification , can be calculated very precisely in 1d .",
    "a frequently studied one - dimensional quasiperiodic tight - binding hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 follow quasiperiodic sequences to be specified below .",
    "the spectra of this kind of hamiltonians have been proven to be cantor sets of zero lebesgue measure for all values of the potential @xmath5 , respectively @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the density of states ( dos ) is purely singular continuous @xcite . in order to characterize the intricate nature of these spectra",
    ", a multifractal analysis of the measure can be elaborated , yielding a multifractal spectrum @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath7 is the hausdorff dimension of the set of energies in the spectrum with local scaling exponent @xmath8 , where @xmath8 characterizes the dos singularities ( @xmath9 ) . the existence of the generalization of such exponents to 2d and 3d can be shown to directly affect the transport properties , and a phenomenological transport theory of quasicrystals involve the distribution of scaling exponents .",

    "@xmath10 can be defined @xcite .",
    "these also play an important role for the understanding of anomalous diffusion properties and the decay of the autocorrelation function encountered in quantum dynamics of quasiperiodic systems @xcite . in the case of a quasiperiodic chain with the golden mean as incommensurability",
    ", a renormalization analysis based on the trace map approach leads to the exact minimal and maximal scaling exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 for all values of the quasiperiodic potential , while the fractal dimensions @xmath7 , @xmath13 , remain unknown @xcite . in the limit of large potential ( @xmath14 ) the renormalization approach of niu and nori has been used to obtain @xmath7 @xcite for this fibonacci chain .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the opposite limit ( @xmath15 quasiperiodic chain .",
    "we begin by reporting briefly on this approach ( ii ) , exploit the results in order to calculate the multifractal properties of the energy spectrum ( iii ) and finally compare our theoretical relations with numerical data ( iv ) .",
    "we consider the tight binding model , @xmath16 with the hopping elements @xmath17 arranged in a quasiperiodic manner : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the fractional part and @xmath20 is an irrational number .",
    "the onsite potentials are @xmath21 if the site @xmath22 is surrounded by two different bonds , and @xmath23 otherwise . in the following",
    "we will consider rational approximants with @xmath24 hopping elements of strength @xmath25 and @xmath26 ones of strength 1 ( i.e. @xmath27 ) and eventually take the limit @xmath28 .",
    "for these approximants with period @xmath29 bloch theorem can be applied , and one obtains @xmath30 energy bands .    for small @xmath31 and @xmath32 perturbation theory",

    "can be renumbered in a compact form : @xmath39 since in the limit of large system size , the spectral properties will not depend on whether @xmath30 is even or odd , we will restrict ourselves , for sake of simplicity , to odd values of @xmath30 .    in order to facilitate perturbation theory and to index the gaps roughly according to their width , sire and",
    "mosseri @xcite introduced a new numbering , where the atoms of the quasiperiodic chain are numbered with respect to their location in perpendicular space rather than with respect to their position in physical space . in this basis",
    "the originally tridiagonal hamiltonian with quasiperiodic entries becomes a multidiagonal hamitonian with identical entries in each secondary diagonal , except for the two bloch entries .    by applying perturbation theory for degenerate states to this hamitonian",
    "it can be shown that the band edges read in first order @xcite : @xmath40 with @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in principle , this expression correctly describes the opening of gaps with index @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath45 all gaps are closed and @xmath46 , which is a mere renumbering of equation ( [ equ : eper ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ equ : start ] ) is the starting point for our calculation of the multifractal properties .",
    "in the thermodynamic formalism the multifractal scaling function @xmath47 is obtained by requiring that the partition function , @xmath48 be constant for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the widths of the individual ( nonoverlapping ) bands . for a periodic chain",
    "it is straightforward to obtain that @xmath51 so that the multifractal spectrum @xmath52 , which is the legendre transform of @xmath53 , consists of two parts : @xmath54 , corresponding to the absolutely continuous component of the dos , and @xmath55 , reflecting the presence of van hove singularities at the edge of the spectrum .    in the following ,",
    "our aim is to calculate the corrections to @xmath56 , respectively @xmath52 , in first order of the quasiperiodic potential .",
    "we will separately consider two cases : the onsite model ( @xmath57 ) and the off - diagonal model ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we begin by treating the former model , which is , as we will see , the more interesting one . in order to calculate the multifractal properties by means of perturbation theory",
    ", we will interpret changes in the scaling exponent as logarithmic corrections in the size of the system @xmath30 for @xmath59 , in the limit of small perturbation ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this method is reminiscent of what is achieved in the field of critical phenomena in order to calculate critical exponents in perturbation theory ( e.g. @xmath61 expansion ) .",
    "the bandwidths @xmath50 of the modulated chain can be expressed by @xmath62 where @xmath63 stands for the corresponding width for the periodic chain : @xmath64 and @xmath65 denotes the decrease of the bandwidth due to the quasiperiodic potential , which can be expanded in a formal series , @xmath66 for simplicity we take @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 ; the final result only depends on @xmath31 , which can be easily checked . inserting equation ( [ equ : exp_q ] ) in ( [ equ : delta ] ) and ( [ equ : gamma ] ) we find the partition function in first order in @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the partition function of the periodic chain . on the other hand ,",
    "inserting @xmath72 into the asymptotic relation @xmath73 yields in first order @xmath74 thus the first order correction @xmath75 reads @xmath76 in order to evaluate this expression we remark that the decrease @xmath77 of each bandwidth is the sum of the half - widths of the two adjoining gaps , i.e. in first order : @xmath78 since @xmath63 depends smoothly on the location of the band , the sum in the numerator of equation ( [ equ : q1 ] ) can be rearranged : @xmath79 in the diagonal case the half - width of the gap is given by , so that we obtain @xmath80 to proceed further we have to distinguish between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "for the first case , and provided @xmath83 is a generic irrational number ( not to well approximated by rationals @xcite ) , we can use the euler - maclaurin formula to convert the sum in the numerator into @xmath84 is a constant .    splitting this integral according to the periodicity of its numerator and replacing the sum in the denominator of equation ( [ equ : q_tau1 ] ) by the corresponding integral",
    ", we finally arrive at the following expression for @xmath75 : @xmath85 which yields @xmath86 therefore we find the following relation for @xmath47 in first order in @xmath69 : @xmath87 using @xmath88 one obtains for the generalized dimensions @xmath89 which remains valid for @xmath90 , yielding @xmath91 .",
    "the limit @xmath92 corresponds to a limiting point of the graph @xmath7 , which is given by : @xmath93    the exponent @xmath94 describing the vanishing of the lebesgue measure or total bandwidth ( @xmath95 ) satisfies @xmath96 , and is found to be @xmath97 , in agreement with the result given in @xcite . as we have made the assumption that @xmath98 is small , the results for @xmath47 and @xmath10 are not valid for large negative values of @xmath99 or @xmath100 , where @xmath75 scales as @xmath101 .",
    "therefore it is not possible to obtain @xmath102 within this approximation . to check self - consistency of our results , however",
    ", we can set @xmath12 equal to the value where @xmath103 .",
    "this yields @xmath104 , which shows that the decrease of @xmath105 is a second order effect in @xmath69 , in agreement with the results obtained by the trace map for the fibonacci chain @xcite , and we can not expect to obtain an exact result for it in this first order calculation .",
    "we also notice that our result is independent of the irrational number @xmath106 . in the case",
    "@xmath107 , we find that the limit in equation ( [ equ : q_tau1 ] ) vanishes as @xmath108 for @xmath49 , thus yielding @xmath109 .",
    "therefore the point @xmath110 , which corresponds to the van hove singularities , does not move in first order of the potential .",
    "this is also consistent with results based on the trace map for the fibonacci chain .",
    "we have seen that perturbation theory in first order of the quasiperiodic potential leads to multifractal properties for the onsite model ( @xmath111 ) . for the off - diagonal model ( @xmath112 )",
    ", however , the half - widths of the gaps @xmath113 . following the same line of calculations as for the off - diagonal model , this uniform shrinking of the bandwidths leads to @xmath114 therefore the corresponding spectrum is a monofractal with all generalized dimensions equal to @xmath115 .",
    "we conclude this paragraph with the remark that it is not the feature diagonal / off - diagonal that leads to the different behavior of the two models . indeed , for the diagonal model @xmath116 with onsite potentials , @xmath117 the band edges are given by @xcite @xmath118 the same argument as above shows that in this case the spectrum is monofractal in first order in @xmath69 .",
    "numerical calculations have been performed to determine the multifractal spectrum . in order to speed up the convergence of the numerical data , we calculate the multifractal scaling function @xmath47 by using the more efficient condition , @xmath119 rather than by using @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we correct the systematic error due to the finite size of the chains by setting @xmath121 where the subscript `` num '' refers to the data obtained by numerical diagonalization and @xmath122 is the asymptotically exact value for the undisturbed system : @xmath123 this correction procedure is also intended to eliminate the logarithmic contribution to the ideal power law ( [ powerlaw ] ) expected near @xmath124 , which is already present for the periodic chain case @xcite , and which can strongly affect the numerical determinations of scaling exponents @xcite",
    ". as we are interested in calculating the first order effects of the quasiperiodic potential , we can evaluate @xmath125 according to equation ( [ equ : exp_gamma ] ) , where , of course , @xmath126 has to be replaced by the value @xmath127 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_alpha ] the numerical curves @xmath7 are compared with the theoretical expression for the onsite model and two different values of @xmath69 ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the limiting points at the left side correspond to @xmath92 and are given by the expressions ( [ equ : a_c ] ) and ( [ equ : f(a_c ) ] ) .",
    "the points calculated from the numerical data are in good agreement with the theoretical result .",
    "the difficulty of approaching the limiting point @xmath130 is due to the very slow convergence of the limit of equation ( [ equ : q_tau1 ] ) , when @xmath99 approaches 1 .",
    "as we have seen , @xmath75 shows a discontinuity for @xmath131 , thus preventing good convergence for a finite system even quite far from the critical value .",
    "this explains why the numerical points end before reaching @xmath132 .",
    "however , the numerically accessible @xmath133 systematically approaches the theoretical value as the system size increases .",
    "[ fig : d_q ] shows the dependence of the generalized dimensions @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) on the quasiperiodic potential @xmath69 for the onsite model .",
    "the lines are the theoretical expressions ( equation ( [ equ : d_q ] ) ) .",
    "comparison with the insert , where the corresponding data are plotted for the off - diagonal model , shows that the different behavior of the two models that has been found theoretically is confirmed by the numerical calculations .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the multifractal spectrum for a general quasiperiodic chain in first order in the quasiperiodic potential .",
    "we have found analytical expressions for the generalized dimensions which are in good agreement with numerical calculations .",
    "the two models under investigation display qualitatively different behavior , the onsite model showing multifractal behavior , the off - diagonal being monofractal .",
