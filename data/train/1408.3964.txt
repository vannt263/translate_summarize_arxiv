    "a gas of particles undergoing elastic collisions evolves to an equilibrium state where the single - particle velocity distribution is gaussian ( maxwell distribution ) .",
    "for such an isolated system , the collisions merely distribute energy among the particles while keeping the total energy constant .",
    "in contrast , if the collisions between particles are inelastic , the system dissipates energy upon collisions ; the change of energy in each binary collision is given by @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the coefficient of restitution , @xmath17 is the mass of the particles , and @xmath18 is the relative velocity along the direction of the collision .",
    "it is indeed possible to go from an inelastic to a quasielastic system of particles within the same experimental setup using tunable repulsive interactions  @xcite . in a system of inelastic gas starting from a spatially homogeneous state ,",
    "the total energy initially decreases according to the famous haff s law  @xcite with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . at long times",
    "the particles form high - density clusters  @xcite with typical mass growing with time as @xmath21 . in this late time regime",
    ", the conservation of momentum dictates that the energy of the system decreases with time as @xmath22 . in one dimension , in this late time regime , the inelastic gas behaves like a perfectly inelastic sticky gas ( ballistic aggregation model ) , which can be described by the inviscid burgers equation  @xcite . for the sticky gas ,",
    "scaling arguments  @xcite as well as exact calculation  @xcite gives @xmath23 .",
    "there is no exact calculation for higher dimensions , and the validity of scaling arguments as well as the burgers - like equation is not clear  @xcite .    in order to keep an inelastic gas in a steady state , it is clearly necessary to inject energy into the system .",
    "it has been found that , if energy injection ( heating ) into the system takes place only at the boundaries , then clustering of the particles still persist in the bulk of the system  @xcite , although there is some evidence of nonclustering for rod - shaped objects  @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate the need of uniform heating in order to obtain a spatially homogeneous steady state for regular granular matter .",
    "for such a uniformly driven system of inelastic particles , one of the most interesting questions is the velocity distribution in the steady state .",
    "experiments on driven granular systems have found non - gaussian velocity distributions  @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution found in some of the experiments @xcite follow the form @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "our interest in this paper is in the uniformly driven inelastic granular gas .    in analytical studies based on kinetic theory methods ,",
    "one constructs the evolution equation for the single - particle velocity distribution function ( ignoring spatial correlations for the homogeneous gas ) . due to the binary collisions , the equation for the single - particle distribution depends on the two - particle distribution , the two - particle distribution depends on the three - particle distribution , and so on  creating a hierarchy of equations for the probability distributions , similar to the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "usually one circumvents this problem by invoking the _ molecular chaos hypothesis _ , which assumes that the colliding particles are uncorrelated before a collision , and hence , factorize the two - particle distribution into two one - particle distributions , resulting in a closed ( _ boltzmann _ ) equation for the single - particle velocity distribution . modeling the uniform heating by adding a diffusive term in the boltzmann equation , van noije and ernst @xcite have calculated the steady state velocity distribution .",
    "they found a stretched exponential tail with @xmath26 , for inelastic hard sphere gas ( where the collision rate is proportional to the relative velocity of the colliding particles ) . on the other hand , the numerical studies by van zon and mckintosh",
    "@xcite have found a continuous spectrum of possible exponents ranging up to @xmath27 rather than a universal exponent @xmath26 .",
    "intrigued by the differences in the two results , in this paper we investigate one of the simplest , yet nontrivial , models of inelastic gases , namely the maxwell model .    in the inelastic maxwell model , introduced by ben - naim and krapivsky  @xcite , the boltzmann equation for the single - particle velocity distribution ( assuming product form of two - point distribution )",
    "is further simplified , by taking the rate of collision to be independent of the velocities of the colliding particles . in this case",
    "it was shown  @xcite that , with the diffusive driving , the steady - state velocity distribution has a form @xmath28 , while it becomes gaussian in the elastic limit  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite , we studied a discrete time version of the inelastic maxwell model , and showed that some exact results could be obtained , without taking recourse to the molecular chaos hypothesis .",
    "in particular , it was observed that the equations for the variance and the two - particle correlations of the velocities close within themselves _",
    "exactly _ , even though the equations for the velocity distributions have the usual hierarchy . from the exact evolution of these equations",
    ", we find that _ purely diffusive driving is not enough _ to sustain the steady state , as it causes the variance and the correlations to increase linearly with time .",
    "this simply follows from the fact that the total momentum of the system also diffuses . as a result ,",
    "the assumption of `` molecular chaos '' is invalid .",
    "we then showed that this problem has a physically motivated resolution namely by introducing a different scheme of driving .",
    "wall collisions of vibrated particles do not conserve total momentum and , is the typical way of driving in real systems we incorporate this into the driving forces and studied the resulting steady state .",
    "importantly , we were also able to obtain the exact tails for the velocity distributions in the steady state .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend the results of discrete time dynamics to a system evolving in continuous time . for the case of continuous time dynamics",
    ", we again illustrate that the evolution equations for the variance and the two - point correlations form a closed set , even though the equations for the distribution functions themselves do not close .",
    "an exact mapping to the discrete model enables us to obtain the high - energy tail of the velocity distribution for the continuous time model .",
    "we also find that the ornstein - uhlenbeck driving is a special case of our model .",
    "this makes it possible to obtain the exact tail behavior of the velocity distribution in a steady state when driven by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "thus our work compliments the previous studies  @xcite where the probability density function ( pdf ) of the velocity is calculated as a series expansion around the maxwellian .",
    "the exact coupled equations , for the variance and correlation , permits one to predict the existence of steady states in different parameter regimes of the system .",
    "in particular , we show the absence of a steady state for a continuous time system driven by purely diffusive driving , which is a special case of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the continuous time model , introduced here has another significance in connection with real systems . in experimental studies of driven granular systems ,",
    "the driving is caused by the collisions of the particles with the vibrating walls of the container .",
    "like interparticle collisions , the wall - collisions also occur as a point process in time , with finite change in particle velocities .",
    "in contrast , the typical analytical models employ continuous driving schemes like diffusive or ornstein - uhlenbeck processes .",
    "we propose that the model that is introduced here is a better scheme of driving in the sense that the driving is taken to be a point process in time with a rate associated with it .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first define the rules for the inelastic collision between a pair of particles as well as the driving mechanism in sec .",
    "[ rules ] .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ continuous point process ] , we discuss the maxwell gas with continuous time dynamics with both collision and driving occurring as poisson processes .",
    "we find an exact formula for the coupled evolution for the variance and the two - particle correlation function .",
    "we also obtain the exact tail of the steady - state velocity distribution in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles .",
    "we point out the correspondence between this continuous time model and the discrete model discussed in  appendix  [ discrete ] . in  sec .",
    "[ ou asymptotic ] , we take a particular limit of the driving parameters to obtain the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the absence of steady state for a system with diffusive driving is easily obtained from the evolution equations .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the maxwell model evolving with discrete dynamics and some of the details are given in the appendix .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the velocities of the particles to be single component ( one dimensional ) . in the inelastic collisions between two particles ( say , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) ,",
    "their velocities are modified from @xmath31 to @xmath32 according to @xmath33 while keeping the total momentum unchanged @xmath34 , where @xmath2 is the coefficient of restitution and we have set the masses of the particles to unity . combining the above two rules ,",
    "one gets the postcollision velocities in terms of the precollision velocities as    [ interparticle collision ] @xmath35    our model of driving is inspired by the collision of particles with a vibrating wall , where the post - collision velocity @xmath36 of a particle is related to its precollision velocity @xmath37 by @xmath38 , with @xmath8 being the coefficient of restitution between the wall and particle collision .",
    "however , the velocity of a massive wall remains unchanged during a collision , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath40 .",
    "one can further assume that , the velocity of the wall in each collision is an uncorrelated random variable .",
