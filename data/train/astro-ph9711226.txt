    "about 25% of the optically visible extragalactic sky is obscured by the dust and stars of our milky way .",
    "dynamically important structures  individual nearby galaxies ( _ cf .",
    "_  dw1 dw1 ) as well as large clusters and superclusters ( _ cf . _  a3627 a3627 )  might still lie hidden in this zone .",
    "complete whole - sky mapping of the galaxy and mass distribution is required in explaining the origin of the peculiar velocity of the local group and the dipole in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "various approaches are presently being employed to uncover the galaxy distribution in the zoa : deep optical searches , far - infrared ( fir ) surveys ( _ e.g. _ ,  iras ) , and blind hi  searches .",
    "all methods produce new results , but all suffer from ( different ) limitations and selection effects . here , the near infrared ( nir ) surveys such as 2mass @xcite and denis in the southern sky , @xcite could provide important complementary data .",
    "nir surveys will : + @xmath5 be sensitive to early - type galaxies  tracers of massive groups and clusters  which are missed in iras and hi  surveys , + @xmath5 have less confusion with galactic objects compared to fir surveys , + @xmath5 be less affected by absorption than optical surveys . + but can we detect galaxies and obtain accurate magnitudes in crowded regions and at high foreground extinction using nir surveys ? to assess the performance of the denis survey at low galactic latitudes we addressed the following questions :    \\(1 ) how many galaxies visible in the @xmath6 band ( @xmath7 )",
    "can we recover in @xmath0  ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath1(@xmath9 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) ?",
    "although less affected by extinction ( 45% , 21% and 9% as compared to @xmath6 ) , their respective completeness limits are lower ( @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , gam3 gam3,gam4 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) can we determine the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2  band luminosity functions ?",
    "\\(3 ) can we map the galactic extinction from nir colours of galaxies behind the milky way ?",
    "\\(4 ) can we identify galaxies at high extinction ( @xmath13 ) where optical surveys fail and fir surveys are plagued by confusion ?",
    "\\(5 ) can we recover heavily obscured spiral galaxies detected in a blind hi  search and hence extend the peculiar velocity field into the zoa via the nir tully ",

    "many of the faint low - latitude galaxies are intrinsically bright galaxies . within the survey region",
    ", we investigated denis data at what seems to be the core of the great attractor ( ga ) , _ i.e. _ ,  in the low - latitude ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , rich cluster abell 3627 , where the galactic extinction is well determined @xcite , and in its extension across the galactic plane where the milky way is fully opaque .",
    "what are the predictions for denis at low latitudes ? in unobscured regions , the density of galaxies per square degree is 110 in the blue for @xmath19 @xcite , and 30 , 11 , and 2 in the @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath2  bands for their respective completeness limits of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( gam3 gam3,gam4 ) .",
    "the number counts in the blue decrease with increasing obscuration as @xmath23)\\,$]deg@xmath24 .",
    "according to car car , the extinction in the nir passbands are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 , hence the decrease in number counts as a function of extinction is considerably slower",
    ". figure  [ galctsplot ] shows the predicted surface number density of galaxies for denis and for @xmath29 , as a function of galactic foreground extinction .",

    "become superior to the @xmath0  band , and we can expect to find galaxies in @xmath1  and @xmath2 , even at @xmath33 .",
    "these are very rough predictions and do not take into account any dependence on morphological type , surface brightness , orientation and crowding , which will surely lower the counts of actually detectable galaxies counts @xcite .    in april 1997 , a new cooling system for the focal instrument of denis has been mounted .",
    "this appears to increase the @xmath2  band limiting magnitude by @xmath34 0.5 magnitude and therewith the number of galaxies detectable in the deepest obscuration layer of the milky way by a factor of about 2 .",
    "consequently , the _ long dashed curve _ representing the @xmath2  counts in figure  [ galctsplot ] should be moved up by roughly a factor of 2 , which would make the @xmath2  passband competitive with @xmath1  starting at @xmath35 .",
    "three high - quality denis strips cross the cluster abell 3627 practically through its center .",
    "we inspected 66 images which cover about one - eighth of the cluster area within its abell - radius of @xmath37 ( each denis image is @xmath38x@xmath38 , offset by @xmath39 in declination and right ascension ) .",
    "the extinction over the regarded cluster area varies as @xmath40 a@xmath41 .",
    "we cross - identified the galaxies found in the optical survey with the denis @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2  images .",
    "an example of a denis image in the central part of the cluster is given in figure  3 of paper i. on the 66 images , 151 galaxies had been identified in the optical .",
    "we have recovered 122 galaxies in the @xmath0  band , 100 in the @xmath1  band , and 74 in the @xmath2  band ( not including galaxies visible on more than one image ) . as suggested by figure  [ galctsplot ] ,",
    "the @xmath2band indeed is not optimal for identifying obscured galaxies at these latitudes due to its shallow magnitude limit .",
    "most of the galaxies not re - discovered in @xmath2  are low surface brightness spiral galaxies .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath1  band provides better galaxy detection than the @xmath0  band . in the latter ,",
    "the severe star crowding makes identification of faint galaxies very difficult . at these extinction levels ,",
    "the optical survey does remain the most efficient in _ identifying _ obscured galaxies .",
    "we have used a preliminary galaxy pipeline @xcite , based upon the sextractor package @xcite on the denis data in the norma cluster to obtain @xmath0 , @xmath1and @xmath2  kron photometry .",
    "although many of the galaxies have a considerable number of stars superimposed on their images , magnitudes derived from this fairly automated algorithm agree well with the few known , independent measurements .",
    "magnitudes could be determined for 109 , 98 and 64 galaxies of the 122 , 100 , 74 galaxies re - discovered in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",

    "the hashed area marks the 60 galaxies common to all 4 passbands .",
    "this subsample is mainly restricted by the @xmath2  band .",
    "the magnitudes in the bottom row are corrected for extinction .",

    "the extinction - corrected blue cluster lf of the 609 galaxies within the abell radius , scaled to the abell area , actually has lower number counts than the @xmath36@xmath43 band lf displayed in the bottom panel of figure  [ lfnorplot ] .",
    "this is explained by the fact that our three strips cross the center of the cluster and therewith the region of highest density .",
    "the comparison indicates that we are fairly complete to a magnitude of @xmath44 , which is more or less the shaded area , and that the shape of the total lf is very similar to the distribution of the common subsample .",
    "even though these lfs are still preliminary ( we have so far covered only a small area of the norma cluster and will have missed dwarf galaxies and other lsb galaxies due to the foreground obscuration ) the here determined extinction - corrected lfs of the galaxies common to all passbands can be regarded as a first indication of the bright end of the nir @xmath1 , and @xmath2   band lfs in rich clusters .    from the below",

    "_  their table  1 ) are so much lower compared to the a3627 cluster .",
    "the nir magnitudes have been used to study the colour  colour diagram  versus . this has been presented and discussed in detail in paper",
    "i. here it suffices to state that the extinction - corrected colours of the cluster galaxies match the colours of galaxies in unobscured high latitude regions @xcite extremely well , suggesting that our preliminary photometry is reasonably accurate .",
    "moreover , the shift in colour can be fully explained by the foreground extinction or , more interestingly , the nir colours of obscured galaxies provide , in principle , an independent way of mapping the extinction in the zoa ( see also gam2 , gam2 ) .",
    "the ga is suspected to cross the galactic plane from the norma cluster in the south towards the centaurus cluster in the north . in this region",
    ", we performed a search for highly obscured galaxies on the so far existing denis survey images .",

    "they are plotted as _ encircled crosses _ in figure  [ bsrchplot ] .",
    "in addition , we found 15 new galaxies in @xmath0  and @xmath1 , 11 of which also appear in the @xmath2   band ( _ filled circles _ ) .",
    "the ratios of galaxies found in @xmath0  compared to @xmath36 , and of @xmath2  compared to @xmath0 are higher than in the norma cluster .",

    "we have found about 3.5 galaxies per square degree in the @xmath0  band .",

    "since we looked in an overdense region we expect _ a priori _ more galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", we do not expect to find galaxies below latitudes of @xmath49 in this longitude range @xcite .",

    "the most important result from this search is that _ highly obscured , optically invisible galaxies can indeed be unveiled in the nir _ and  as indicated with the distribution in the right panel of figure  [ bsrchplot ]  found at lower latitudes than the deep optical survey . the lowest galactic latitude at which we found a galaxy is @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "nir surveys are the only tools that will identify early - type galaxies and therewith uncover the cores of massive groups and clusters at very low - latitudes . in addition",
    ", highly obscured spiral galaxies should be detectable with these surveys as well .",
    "such identifications will proof important in connection with the systematic blind hi  survey currently conducted with the multibeam receiver ( 13 beams in the focal plane array ) at the 64 m parkes telescope : a deep survey with a @xmath59 detection limit of 10mjy is being performed in the most opaque region of the southern milky way ( @xmath60 ; @xmath61 ) for the velocity range of @xmath6212000 kms@xmath63@xcite .",
