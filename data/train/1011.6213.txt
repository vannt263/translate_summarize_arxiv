    "recently , we have introduced the framework of highly - anisotropic and strongly - dissipative hydrodynamics @xcite ( adhydro ) .",
    "this framework is suitable for modeling of early stages of relativistic heavy - ion collisions , in the situations where very large pressure anisotropies are expected @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite our approach was used to describe boost - invariant , one - dimensional systems , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite we applied adhydro in non - boost - invariant situations .",
    "adhydro is a simple extension of the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics . for locally isotropic fluids it is reduced to perfect - fluid description , and for small pressure anisotropies and purely longitudinal expansion it agrees with the 2nd order israel - stewart viscous hydrodynamics ( we note that longitudinal expansion dominates at the early stages of heavy - ion collisions ) . for highly - anisotropic systems ,",
    "adhydro may be treated as an effective model which describes strongly non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the construction of adhydro was motivated by the idea of developing an approach that is suitable for uniform description of several stages of the evolution of matter  starting from the very early stages where the momentum anisotropies are extremely high , through the transient viscous evolution , and ending with the perfect - fluid stage . since most of the realistic hydrodynamic calculations indicate that the evolution of the system is very well described by the perfect - fluid hydrodynamics ( or , equivalently , by viscous hydrodynamics with a very small ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy ) with the starting proper time below  . ]",
    "@xcite , we expect that the adhydro description is reduced or becomes very close to perfect - fluid hydrodynamics at the proper time @xmath0 . on the other hand , at the very early stages of the collisions , @xmath1 , neither perfect - fluid hydrodynamics nor viscous hydrodynamics are formally applicable .",
    "in particular , viscous corrections become compatible with the leading terms , which may lead to negative pressure .",
    "thus , the very early dynamics requires the use of the kinetic theory ( which has its own well known limitations ) or modeling .",
    "adhydro is a proposal for such modeling .",
    "a work along similar lines have been recently done by martinez and strickland @xcite , who derive analogous equations from the boltzmann equation with the collision term treated in the relaxation time approximation . instead of the usual expansion around the isotropic one - particle distribution",
    ", they consider an expansion around an anisotropic distribution . in this paper",
    "we compare some aspects of our approach with that presented in @xcite .",
    "the main model assumptions of adhydro are the form of the energy - momentum tensor that allows for anisotropic pressure and the form of the entropy source . for small anisotropies , the form of the entropy source",
    "is restricted by the consistency with the 2nd order viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "on the other hand , for large anisotropies , various forms of the entropy source are conceivable .",
    "of course it would be very useful to obtain some hints about the form of the entropy source from the underlying microscopic dynamics .",
    "such connections are , however , difficult to find since the initial dynamics of the system produced in heavy - ion collisions is very much complicated .",
    "therefore , in this paper we simply use different forms of the entropy source and study their effects on the evolution of the system .    besides the analysis of the entropy source term , we discuss the microscopic interpretation of our framework and analyze the effects of quantum statistics . we find that the inclusion of the bose - einstein statistics leads to minor quantitative modifications of the approach introduced in @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this paper we present new results obtained for the initial pressure anisotropy that depends on rapidity . we demonstrate that such initial conditions do not affect the isotropization process .",
    "the adhydro model @xcite is based on the following form of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite @xmath2 in eq .",

    "( [ init_sigma ] ) , ( [ init_vartheta ] ) and ( [ init_x ] ) ( dashed lines ) . in the two considered cases the entropy profiles behave in the very similar way .",
    "the behavior of the fluid rapidity is different only at the beginning of the evolution for large rapidities .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the assumptions of the recently formulated model that may be used to describe the evolution of a highly - anisotropic fluid formed at the very early stages of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we have considered three forms of the entropy source which defines the dynamics of the system .",
    "we have found that the numerical results depend very weakly on the particular form of the entropy source .",
    "we have also studied microscopic interpretation of the model , discussing different forms of the microscopic phase - space distribution function .",
    "we have found that corrections for quantum effects lead to minor quantitative differences as compared to the standard case where the phase space distribution is described by the ( stretched or squeezed ) boltzmann distribution .",
    "we have performed the numerical calculations for the cases where the initial anisotropy depends on space - time rapidity . in such cases",
    "the evolution of the system is more complicated but the tendency of the system to equilibrate is not changed .",
    "altogether , we have found that the results obtained with the adhydro model are stable against various modifications of the model components such as : the entropy source , the form of the microscopic phase - space distribution function , or the form of the initial conditions .",
    "we consider such stability as an attractive physical feature of the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this section we give the explicit form of the lorentz transformation which leads from the center - of - mass frame of the colliding nuclei to the local - rest - frame of the fluid element .",
    "this transformation is constructed as a sequence of the longitudinal lorentz boost , rotation around the @xmath166-axis , and the transverse lorentz boost . in this way",
    "the complete transformation does not change the longitudinal direction .",
    "the four - vectors @xmath6 and @xmath8 may be written in the following form @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the longitudinal fluid rapidity and @xmath169 is the transverse fluid rapidity .",
    "the lorentz transformation leading to the local rest frame consists of the lorentz boost along the @xmath166-axis , @xmath170 the rotation around the @xmath166-axis , @xmath171 and the lorentz boost along the @xmath35-axis @xmath172 by direct multiplication one may check that @xmath173 in order to move from the local rest frame to the center - of - mass frame we perform the inverse transormation .",
    "the concept of adhydro includes , as a special case , the framework of transverse hydrodynamics . in the latter case , we assume that the distribution function ( [ fxp2 ] ) has the following factorized form @xmath174 here @xmath175 is a normalization constant and @xmath176 is the dirac delta function . equation ( [ th1 ] ) allows us to make the identification @xmath177 using our general definition of the function @xmath38 , see eq .",
    "( [ rofiks ] ) , we find @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a constant .",
    "equations ( [ th3 ] ) used in ( [ varer])([plr ] ) immediately yield @xmath180 hence , the ansatz ( [ th1 ] ) corresponds to the situation where the longitudinal pressure vanishes and the system may be treated as a collection of independent clusters which expand transversally .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 describes temperature of two - dimensional transverse clusters . for the purely longitudinal expansion , the parton density drops like @xmath181 .",
    "since @xmath182 , the value of @xmath25 remains unchanged .",
    "clearly , only transverse expansion can lower cluster s temperature . moreover , in such a boost - invariant case @xmath183 , hence the ratio of the transverse and longitudinal pressure always grows and the system can not reach stable isotropic equilibrium .",
    "in this appendix we discuss consequences of replacing the classical distribution function by its quantum analogs , the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "the integrals over the distribution function ( [ fbe ] ) may be done by expanding ( [ fbe ] ) in a geometric series , @xmath184 and by integrating ( [ fbeexp ] ) term by term .",
    "for example , starting from the general definition of the function @xmath38 , see eq .",
    "( [ rofiks ] ) , we obtain @xmath185 introducing the new integration variables : @xmath186 and @xmath187 we find @xmath188 the sum over @xmath34 factorizes and gives the riemann zeta function @xmath189 . as a consequence",
    ", we obtain the simple relation to the `` classical '' result , @xmath190    we note that a similar technique may be used in the calculations involving the fermi - dirac distribution . in this case",
    "we have @xmath191 and eq .",
    "( [ rofiks ] ) leads us to the expression @xmath192 as in the standard treatment of the fermi - dirac distributions in statistical mechanics , we may change the summation in the following way @xcite @xmath193 in the last sum we change @xmath34 to @xmath194 and obtain @xmath195 now , in the first integral on the right - hand - side of ( [ fd2 ] ) we change the integration variables to @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and in the second integral we change to @xmath196 and @xmath197 . in this way we find @xmath198 where the factor of @xmath199 follows from the term @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is the total power of @xmath202 and @xmath203 appearing in the second integral in ( [ fd2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the final result is @xmath204 we stress that the definition of @xmath68 involves the number of the internal degrees of freedom @xmath62 , hence when dealing with both bosons and fermions at the same time , one should introduce @xmath68 separately for bosons and fermions and add them together , @xmath205 . \\label{rbefd}\\ ] ] here @xmath206 and @xmath207 are the numbers of internal degrees of freedom of bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 defined by eq .",
    "( [ gconst ] ) may be also calculated for the case of massless bosons and fermions .",
    "following the same steps as in the calculation of the functions @xmath208 and @xmath209 we obtain @xmath210 @xmath211 and for the sum @xmath212 equations ( [ rbefd ] ) and ( [ gbefd ] ) may be used for @xmath38 and @xmath40 appearing in eqs .",
