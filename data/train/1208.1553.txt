    "this is the third of a series of studies about neutrinoproduction of photons and pions with neutrino energy @xmath9 gev where the @xmath3 excitation is important @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is the coherent production . as we know",
    ", in the neutrino - oscillation experiments , for example miniboone @xcite , the photon and pion neutrinoproduction from nuclei and nucleons are potential backgrounds .",
    "it is still a question whether nc photon production might explain the excess events seen at low _ reconstructed _ neutrino energies in the miniboone experiment , which the microboone experiment plans to answer @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors argued that the anomalous interaction terms involving @xmath1 , @xmath2 boson , and the photon may increase neutral current ( nc ) photon production .",
    "so the cross - section calculation for these processes becomes necessary .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce the @xmath3 resonance as a manifest degrees of freedom in a lorentz - covariant effective field theory ( eft ) with a nonlinear realization of the @xmath7 chiral symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we study both neutrinoproductions from free nucleons and calibrate our theory . because of various symmetries that are built in , the conservation of vector current ( cvc ) , and the partial conservation of axial current ( pcac ) are satisfied automatically , which is crucial for photon production calculation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we work on the incoherent productions from the nucleus .",
    "the previous studies show that the contributions due to the two terms mentioned above @xcite are tiny in the nc photon production from both free nucleons and nuclei . this paper is devoted to the study of coherent productions from @xmath10 , which is the major target nucleus in the miniboone s detector , and also to addressing the significance of the two mentioned terms .    here",
    "we apply the so - called `` optimal '' approximation , in which one - nucleon interaction amplitude can be factorized out from the full nuclear matrix element leading to great simplification of the calculation .",
    "meanwhile both the cvc and the pcac are preserved .",
    "the nuclear ground state is calculated by using the mean - field approximation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) .",
    "the optimal approximation was first illustrated generally for projectile - nucleus scattering in refs .",
    "it has been applied quite successfully to nucleon - nucleus scattering in a relativistic framework @xcite . moreover ,",
    "a similar approximation has been applied in pion - nucleus elastic scattering @xcite and coherent pion photo- and electro - production @xcite .",
    "it was realized that the medium - modification of the one - nucleon interaction amplitude plays a key role in the coherent production , which is also included in our revised approximation . in the qhd eft model , baryons interact with each other via . exchanging the mesons",
    "( in the space - like region ) .",
    "because these bosonic fields develop finite expectation values in the medium , the real part of the baryon self - energy is modified on the mean - field level @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the change of the @xmath3 width has been studied in the nonrelativistic framework both phenomenologically @xcite and theoretically @xcite , but it is not completed in the relativistic framework @xcite . here",
    "we continue our simple treatment proposed in ref .",
    "another important factor related to the @xmath3 is the distorted pion wave function in the pion production , which is included here by using the eikonal approximation .",
    "such an effect can be ignored for photon production . comparing the two",
    "may be used to disentangle the medium - modification and the pion wave function distortion .    to benchmark the approximation scheme , we calculate various differential cross sections for pion photoproduction .",
    "we are able to get an agreement with existing data @xcite .",
    "the approximation is then applied to study the photon and pion neutrinoproduction .",
    "unfortunately , existing neutrino experiments , for example refs .",
    "@xcite , do not put a strong constraint on pion productions with @xmath9 gev , since most of them have only spectrum - averaged measurements , and the mean neutrino energy is around @xmath11 gev . on the theoretical side , there are other microscopic calculations on pion productions @xcite . in most of them ,",
    "the optimal approximation is in one way or another applied .",
    "the @xmath3 dynamics is taken into account by using the nonrelativistic models .",
    "the final pion wave function is calculated either in the eikonal approximation or by solving the schroedinger equation with the pion optical potential .",
    "the key difference between our work and others is that we work in a lorentz - covariant eft , which has been applied successfully to nuclear many - body problems and also has been calibrated for neutrinoproductions from free nucleons .",
    "the medium - modification of baryons can be calculated on the mean - field level .",
    "we can address the power counting of different diagrams in this eft , although the theory can only be used at the low energy region ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "more importantly , coherent nc photon production has rarely been discussed in the microscopic approach .",
    "in addition , there exists a macroscopic approach , which treats the nucleus as a whole and makes use of the forward scattering behavior of coherent pion production in the high energy scattering . in the forward scattering kinematics",
    ", pcac leads to a relation between the pion neutrinoproduction and pion - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "this is initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite , used in the nuance event generator @xcite , and revised recently in refs .",
    "this approach has also been applied to compute coherent photon neutrinoproduction at the @xmath13 gev region and beyond @xcite .",

    "the @xmath131 gauge symmetry and chiral symmetry guarantee the conservation of vector current and partial conservation of axial current .",
    "these constraints seem trivial at the nucleon level , but important in many - body calculations .",
    "for example , various procedures would have to be applied by hand to make sure the vector current conserved , if gauge symmetry is not manifest .",
    "even worse , this procedure can be entangled with the specific approximation scheme .",
    "another advantage of working in the eft is the power - counting of diagrams , through which we can address the relevance of some interaction vertices . in incoherent nc photon production , we see the two contact terms @xmath87 and @xmath93 , which can be partially related with the newly proposed meson s anomalous interactions , are negligible ( they are at next - to - next - to - leading order ) .",
    "their contributions do show up in the coherent productions , e.g. coherent pion photoproduction and nc photon production , as demonstrated in this paper , but do not seem to increase the photon production as substantially as needed to explain the excess in the miniboone experiment .    after discussing this paper in a big context ,",
    "let s proceed to summarize the specifics .",
    "the so - called optimal approximation is introduced to simplify the calculation of nuclear matrix element , in which the one - body current matrix elements are factorized out .",
    "meanwhile the modification on the one - body interaction amplitude is taken into account .",
    "the real part of the nucleon and the @xmath3 self - energies is calculated by using the mean - field approximation of this model .",
    "the change of the @xmath3 width is parameterized in a phenomenological way according to pion - nucleus scattering data .",
    "the medium - modifications have been tested in incoherent pion production in ref .",
    "the eikonal approximation is used to handle the distortion of the final pion wave function .",
    "moreover , we have compared our approximation with the one used in @xcite in which the authors introduce other densities besides the baryon density used in our approximation .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compared_with_currentdecomposed ] that the two methods give similar results .",
    "we calculate the differential cross sections for pion photoproduction , which serves as the benchmark for our approximations , and then calculate the total cross sections for pion neutrinoproductions .",
    "the results are sensitive to @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and the contact term @xmath87 .",
    "the disagreement at high energy with the fixed pion angle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photopionprod_theta_60_c12 ] and at the big pion angle with fixed photon energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photopionprod_ei_c12 ] seems to indicate that it is necessary to go beyond the one - body current approximation to explain the full data .",
    "however , to resolve the disagreement , both the @xmath3 dynamics and the distortion of the pion wave function should be understood better as well . in addition",
    ", we also compare our neutrinoproduction results with those in the literature to check our numerical calculation . finally in photon neutrinoproduction",
    ", the total cross sections also depend on @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath87 .",
    "changing @xmath87 from 1.5 to 3 increases both neutrino- and antineutrino - induced photon production by roughly @xmath128 .",
    "now , let s come back to the question about the photon production being the excess events in the miniboone experiment .",
    "one tricky point should be pointed out here .",
    "the _ reconstructed _ neutrino energy is based on cc quasi elastic scattering kinematics , which can underestimate the neutrino energy in the photon production .",
    "so the high energy neutrino contribution to the photon production should be addressed before drawing a definite conclusion for this question .",
    "the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite and this paper illustrate the approximations used in both incoherent and coherent productions , and provide important calibration for the modification of the one - nucleon interaction amplitude in nuclei .",
    "the sensible extrapolations of current results to the high energy region will be pursued in future work .",
