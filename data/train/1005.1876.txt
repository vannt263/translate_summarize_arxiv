    "( 2002 ) , we have @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the feedback from supernova and central black hole respectively .",
    "therefore , with the scaling approximation , we have sfr @xmath17 , where t is the evolutionary time , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the ratio between star formation feedback by supernova and sfr , @xmath20 . in a virialized dark matter halo ,",
    "the total gas @xmath21 is about 18% of the dark halo mass .",
    "the condensation timescale can be estimated as @xmath22 .",
    "the central black hole quenches the star formation in the halo effectively after the time about @xmath23 , where @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 . in other words ,",
    "the cooling gas inside the virialized dark halo forms into stars and galaxy , the star formation process begins and persists with a relatively high rate until a few times of @xmath28 yr so that the central seed black hole growth is enough to be a supermassive black hole and it shines as a quasar .",
    "after that , the central black hole will release the kinetic feedback , heat the cold gas , and quench the star formation .    in this paper ,",
    "the grb host is believed to be the young , star - forming galaxies . during the forming time about a few times of @xmath0 yr",
    ", the star formation process is violently on - going .",
    "the masses of these host galaxies are in general less than @xmath29(savaglio et al .",
    "2009 ) . about these grb host galaxies , three physical inputs emphasized below",
    "can decide the whole recipes : ( 1 ) redshift z : at different redshifts , the star formation and galactic evolution processes are different ; ( 2 ) dark halo mass @xmath7 : as mao et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and lapi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) pointed out , the host dark halos in which grbs occur are relatively small , usually , they are less than @xmath30 . in this paper , we select @xmath31 as a reference value ; this is consistent with the simulation results of courty et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and campisi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; ( 3 ) evolutionary time t : the grb host galaxy is in the initial stage of the galaxy evolution ; this initial time t is about a few times of @xmath0 yr , less than about a few times of @xmath28 yr .",
    "this value is supported by the observations from thne et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and han et al .",
    "it is noted that at this stage the central black hole seed does not have enough growth to be a supermassive black hole ; thus , the quasar feedback can be ignored in our calculations .",
    "the evolutionary time t can be roughly estimated as the starburst time in one starburst galaxy as well and the central black hole activity takes negligible effects on the galactic evolution .",
    "thus , after these three inputs are given , the sfr in the grb host galaxies can be decided .",
    "we begin the procedure from the sfr and galactic mass calculation of the hosts , the b - band absolute magnitudes of the hosts can be derived from the empirical relation of savaglio et al .",

    "we have reproduced the sfr at each redshift , the stellar mass of host galaxy can be derived as sfr multiplied by the galactic formation timescale .",

    "the observational sfr values that spread over a wide range , from 0.01@xmath38 to about @xmath39 within the redshift bin @xmath40 , are shown .",
    "our model predicts in general that sfr values are larger toward the redshift larger than 1 .    the relation between the sfr and the stellar mass of grb host galaxy is given in fig .",
    "this possible correlation is also mentioned by savaglio et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in our model",
    ", we illustrate that this correlation at given redshift with a given dark halo mass could be due to the growth of the host protogalaxies under the certain galactic formation timescale . however , there is no straightforward relation shown by the observational data in fig .",
    "we note that within the different dark halos the sfrs and the stellar masses are different .",
    "furthermore , some galaxies with relatively larger masses at lower redshift might have experienced twice or even more times of starbursts during their lifetimes .",
    "especially , it is found easily in the plot that the infrared - selected host galaxies have larger stellar masses .",
    "this complicated situation indicates that at low redshift , the grb host galaxies might not have a monolithic evolutionary process .",

    ", we adopt the observational results by savaglio et al .",

    "it is suggested by malesani et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that at higher redshift the grb host galaxies could be brighter . in our model ,",
    "we point out that this is the result coming from the intrinsic sfr redshift distribution .    in order to investigate the possible metallicity distribution , in this paper , assuming that the mass - metallicity relation and its redshift evolution(savaglio et al . 2005 ) are valid for the grb host galaxies as well , after calculation on the stellar masses of grb hosts , we obtain the metallicity evolution as shown in fig .",
    "the metallicity values of the host galaxies slightly decrease toward the higher redshift .",
    "this finding is consistent with that obtained by li ( 2008 ) .",
    "we caution that the metal - poor case is not a necessary input condition in our model ; thus , the metallicity may not be the essence for grb production .",
    "further metallicity estimations of grb host galaxies are given in section 3 .",
    "x - ray telescope(xrt ) , one of the instruments onboard the _ swift _ satellite , has supplied the important x - ray data in the 0.3 - 10 kev band for the grb research . the swift - xrt analysis has been performed automatically , and the spectral results for swift - observed grbs have been presented by evans et al .",

    "( 2010 ) , although it was claimed that generally the selection effects on the distribution of host column densities are not significant , in our paper , in order to investigate the possible selection effects on our results , first , we check the possible @xmath47 relation and the @xmath48 relation respectively from the data of schady et al .",
    "we see that the correlation between @xmath34 and redshift has the efficient @xmath49 with null hypotheses 0.0006 , this relation could be due to the selection effect mentioned above , but we do not find any possible relation between @xmath33 and redshift . as @xmath34 increases with redshift , @xmath50 also increases with redshift .",

    "[ f5 ] , we see that the observational data have large scatter . on the other hand , our model provides the different values under the different dark halo masses and evolutionary time .",
    "therefore , we also conclude that the large absorption is due to the longer galactic evolution time within the massive dark halo , while the small attenuation is due to the shorter galactic evolution time within the smaller dark halo . from the theoretical point of view , we confirm that the absorption is from the local environment of grb , as suggested by campana et al .",

    "the range of these values is from @xmath56 to @xmath57(see fig .",

    "but the thin cloud with the smaller neutral hydrogen values might be intervening along the line of sight between the observer and the grb place ; this kind of thin cloud with the column density less than @xmath59 might not be related to the grb host .",
    "also , in this paper , we assume that grb hosts are rich in neutral gas .",
    "therefore , we only select the @xmath55 values larger than @xmath60 and compare them with the corresponding x - ray absorption @xmath34 values .",

    "( 2010 ) . in general ,",
    "low - mass stars take a long time to evolve to asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase and to produce the dust ; thus , agb population only dominate the dust production at local universe .",
    "it is suggested that at high - redshift the dust factory is supernova explosion .",
    "however , recently , agb population has been found to be the source of dust production at high redshift universe(valiante et al .",
    "2009 ) : dust production is mainly from supernova at the beginning of the evolution , but for the time larger than @xmath62 yr , the dust contribution from agb stars increases . from the calculation of valiante et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we see that at time @xmath63 yr , agb dust production is still 10 times lower than that of supernova .",
    "thus , in our paper , including the agb dust production , the dust extinction @xmath33 is added by a factor of 8% . while at the time @xmath64 yr , the agb dust production is as same as supernova dust production .",
    "thus , we estimate from our model that the total dust extinction @xmath33 is 1.7 times of the original value in which only supernova production is included .",
    "therefore , we clearly see that both agb and supernova are the origin of dust production at the late evolution time larger than @xmath28 yr .",
    "finally , we can not ignore the selection effect : at high redshift , the grbs and their hosts with high absorption values are difficult to be detected by optical telescopes .",
    "under the framework of galaxy formation scenario , lapi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) predicted the grb progenitor rate and redshift distribution . in this paper , without the information of grb rates and the cosmological star formation density , we attempt to reveal some properties of grbs and their host galaxies , which have intrinsic redshift distributions .",
    "the distributions of these properties with redshift are found to be originally from the star formation in the star - forming galaxies . given a proper galactic evolutionary time and a reasonable dark halo mass , the final results can be obtained by the model calculation . these results are compared with all kinds of observational data .    at high redshift , the grb host galaxy has a plenty of neutral gas , suffering much violent star formation .",
    "after the short - time stellar evolution phase , the metal and dust are released by massive stars ; thus , the optical and x - ray grb emissions will have a strong attenuation locally at high redshift .",
    "the star formation activity , evolving from relatively massive hosts at high redshift to dwarf galaxies at low redshift , is a coincidence with the so - called downsizing scenario(e.g .",
    ", heavens et al . 2004 ) . however , at lower redshift , the situation turns to be more complicated . from the morphological statistics by conselice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and wainwright et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the grb hosts present a broad diversity of galaxy types .",
    "about 1/3 host galaxies in the sample of savaglio et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are mergers , while in our model the merging and interaction processes are not taken into account .",
    "in fact , conselice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the grb hosts at @xmath65 are different from those at @xmath2 in terms of light concentration and the morphological size . through the study of",
    "galaxy mass distribution , grb hosts tracing star formation might be biased at low redshift(kocevski et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is also complex that the hosts at @xmath2 are not representative of the general galaxy population(levesque et al .",
    "thus , the properties of these low - redshift grb hosts presented in this paper could not be reproduced by any monolithic process .",
    "at least , some low - redshift galaxies may undergo multiple star - forming processes during their whole lifetimes .",
    "grb production can be accompanied with any single starburst event .    from the analysis in this paper",
    ", we see that the absorption of grb x - ray and optical emissions is relatively strong .",
    "the strong intrinsic attenuation of grb host galaxies may produce some dark bursts , defined by the index @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the flux density ratio between optical and x - ray bands(jakobsson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "rol et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed several extinction origins from their preliminary results . from our calculations",
    ", we see that the heavy attenuation may occur due to the following three possibilities : ( 1 ) the local environment of the host is metal - enriched , metallicity is higher , and/or , the host galaxy in the massive dark halo larger than @xmath68 may have strong absorption .",
    "for example , at redshift 2.5 , @xmath69 , halo mass @xmath70 , after the galactic evolving time @xmath71 , we have dust extinction @xmath72 and the corresponding x - ray absorption @xmath73 ; ( 2 ) the dust and metals surrounding the grb in the host galaxy are distributed in an inhomogeneous way ; there could be heavy absorption through the line of sight , but in other directions the absorption is slight . also , in our model , we assume that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are measured locally and do not change significantly if the dust and gas extend out to a few tens to hundreds of pc from the burst(perna & lazzati 2002 , delia et al .",

    "( 2007 , 2010 ) may be invalid and our calculations are strongly biased ; ( 3 ) as mentioned in section 2.2.2 , the dust produced by the agb population at high redshift should be taken into account .    in order to further understand the metal production of grb environment , we roughly re - estimate the metallicity of grb hosts under our framework .",

    "the metal - enriched environment of grb host galaxy naturally gives the reason of the strong attenuation in x - ray and optical band measurements . in our model , the initial galactic evolutionary time of about @xmath0 yr of host galaxies is given , but the corresponding metallicity about @xmath84(lapi et al .",
    "2008 ) is not a necessary condition , as mentioned by levesque et al .",
    "( 2009b ) that low metallicity may not be required for a relativistic explosion . with our model",
    ", the massive dark halo above @xmath68 can host the grb galaxy in which the metallicity is relatively high , although most grb host galaxies are inside the dark halos with the masses less than @xmath68 .",
    "on the other hand , a host galaxy with a top - heavy imf , meaning that much more massive stars are involved , can produce more metals in relatively short time during the galactic evolution phase .",
    "for instance , the wolf - rayet star with a mass of 80@xmath85 and initial metallicity @xmath86 has the possibility to self - enrich the hii region(krger , hensler & freyer 2006 ) and to produce the grb event(eldridge et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have calculated the sfr , galactic mass , and metallicity of the grb host galaxies .",
    "the absorption variations with redshift in the x - ray and optical bands are presented as well .",
    "some selection effects have been taken into account through our calculation .",
    "other observational biases should also be considered .",
    "all the redshift measurements come from the optical observations so that some optical - faint grbs and host galaxies are ignored . moreover , at high redshift only most luminous galaxies with high sfrs can be detected , indicating that some low - luminosity cases are not included .",
    "however , our calculations come from the intrinsic star formation of grb host galaxies .",
    "thus , due to all these selection effects and observational bias mentioned in the paper , the intrinsic properties of grb afterglows and the hosts by the model calculations have some differences to those from observations .",
    "as sfr evolution plays a dominant role in the calculations , compared to the situation at low redshift , in general , star formation in the metal - poor environment at high redshift may provide more powerful grb explosion .",
    "therefore , although the effective threshold is given by kistler et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we speculate that improving the sensitivity of detectors on the high - energy telescopes is not strongly useful to catch more high - redshift but faint grbs , since low - energy - released grbs are almost absent in the high - redshift universe .",
