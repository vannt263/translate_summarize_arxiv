    "the most salient quantum features in the context of a phase - space noncommutative ( nc ) extension of quantum mechanics ( qm ) have already been quantified @xcite and issues such as quantum entanglement @xcite , quantum beating , wave function collapse and loss of quantum coherence @xcite have also been examined .",
    "these findings allow for a broader understanding of the correspondence between quantum and classical systems , as well as for probing the role of the nc deformation when tuning to standard qm predictions .",
    "the nc extensions of qm show an impressive range of characteristic features when concerned on studies of the quantum hall effect @xcite , on the the gravitational quantum well for ultra - cold neutrons @xcite , on the landau level and the @xmath0 harmonic oscillator problems in the phase - space @xcite , and as a probe for quantum beating and missing information effects @xcite as well as for quantum entanglement issues @xcite .",
    "this nc qm scenario also admits putative violations of the robertson - schrdinger uncertainty relation @xcite . on a broader context",
    ", noncommutativity is believed to be relevant in the formalism of quantum gravity and string theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the framework of quantum cosmology , phase - space noncommutativity has shown to bring up novel features in what concerns the black hole singularity @xcite , as well as to the equivalence principle @xcite .    from the theoretical perspective , the nc qm is supported by extensions of the heisenberg - weyl algebra @xcite .",
    "the theory lives in a @xmath1-dimensional phase - space where time is required to be a commutative parameter , and coordinate and momentum variables obey a nc algebra . in particular , the nc extension of qm is more suitably formulated in the weyl - wigner - groenewold - moyal ( wwgm ) formalism for qm @xcite . from the subjacent algebra perspective , the phase - space nc generalizations of qm are based on extensions of the heisenberg - weyl algebra @xcite .",
    "nc qm shows also to have a bearing on issues such as the osawa s uncertainty principle ( oup)@xcite as discussed in ref .",
    "relevantly , the oup is claimed to be the one supported experimentally @xcite .",
    "the proposal of this contribution is to extend the formalism for describing quantumness and separability of two - mode gaussian states , setting up a nc criterion for entanglement .",
    "we report on some previous results on the phase - space nc qm @xcite , more specifically on the role of phase - space noncommutativity to yield gaussian entangled states . concerning the framework for identifying the separability and the entanglement of quantum gaussian states , one of the main results reported in this manuscript",
    "is related to the positive partial transposed ( ppt ) separability criterion @xcite .",
    "generically , the ppt criterion provides a necessary and , in some cases , sufficient condition for distinguishing between separable and entangled states in discrete quantum systems .",
    "the framework has been extended to continuous variable systems @xcite by implementing the partial transpose operation as a mirror reflection in the wigner phase - space .",
