    "a number of `` two - state '' models were proposed to rationalize the phase behavior of poly(ethylene oxide ) ( peo ) and its solution thermodynamics.karlstrom,matsuyama,n-cluster1,n-cluster2,bekiranov,dormidphase within these models the monomers are in dynamic equilibrium involving two interconverting states ( fig .",

    "additional contributions are due to the mixing entropy of the different monomeric states and their interactions .",

    "the specific features of a particular model are grouped into @xmath8 . in",
    "the following we consider the self - consistent field ( scf ) theory of brushes of `` two - state polymers '' in terms of @xmath8 . a significant part of our discussion is devoted to brushes of polymers capable of undergoing a second type of phase separation.@xcite within a brush",

    "these include the non - monotonous variation of the brush thickness with the grafting density and the appearance of distinct regimes in the compression force profiles .",
    "this approach is of interest because of a number of reasons : ( i ) @xmath9 determines a number of important characteristics of the brush among them the concentration profile , the distribution of free - ends and the force profile associated with the compression of the brush .",
    "thus , a description of the brush behavior in terms of @xmath8 accounts for the leading brush properties and facilitates the comparison of the predictions of the different models .",
    "the specific features of the individual models and their parameters come into play when the distribution of the monomer states is of interest",

    "( ii ) the formulation of the theory in terms of @xmath8 underlines the relationship to the measurable @xmath10as obtained from the study of the colligative properties of the polymer solutions.@xcite @xmath11 is helpful in determining the parameters of the models . in the context of brushes , the behavior of @xmath11 provides , as we shall discuss , a useful diagnostic for systems expected to exhibit a vertical phase separation within the brush .",
    "( iii ) while our discussion focuses on the two - state models cited above , the analysis can be extended to other models@xcite that yield a @xmath6 dependent @xmath12 .",
    "( iv ) the scf theory of brushes characterized by @xmath9 suggests useful tests for the occurrence of vertical phase separation .",
    "this is of interest , as we shall discuss in the final section , because of experimental indications that such behavior occurs in brushes of pnipam .",
    "( v ) the concentration profiles obtained from the scf theory are essentially identical to those derived@xcite from the pincus approximation where the distribution of free - ends is assumed rather than derived.@xcite in marked contrast , the compression force profiles are sensitive to the distribution of free - ends and the two methods yield different results .",
    "the two - state models differ in their identification of the interconverting states . within the @xmath13-cluster model@xcite",
    "one is a bare monomer while the second is a monomer incorporated into a stable cluster of @xmath13 monomers . in the remaining models one of the monomeric states is hydrophilic and",

    "model@xcite the two states differ in their dipole moment and their interconversion involves an internal rotation .",
    "the models of matsuyama and tanaka,@xcite bekiranov _ _ et al__@xcite and of dormindotova@xcite assume that the hydrophilic monomeric state forms a h - bond to a water molecule while the hydrophobic state does not .",

    " focused on a particular model and were formulated in terms of the corresponding free energy .",
    "this obscured common features between the different models and hampered the comparison between them .",
    "for example , while a vertical phase separation is possible within all two - state models , this scenario was mainly studied for the @xmath13-cluster model thus creating a misleading impression about the physical origins of this phenomenon .",
    "our discussion concerns a brush of flexible two - state  chains , terminally grafted to a planar surface .",

    "the free energy per lattice site is @xmath16this form corresponds to the @xmath17 limit .",
    "it is appropriate for brushes of any @xmath4 because the grafted chains lose their mobility and thus have no translational entropy .",
    "the application of our analysis to a particular case is illustrated for the karlstrom model .",

    "the only assumption made is that @xmath18 can be expanded in powers of @xmath6 @xmath19where the @xmath20 are specific to a given model . for simplicity we further limit the discussion to systems where the first three terms provide an accurate description of @xmath21 .",
    "as we shall discuss , the presence of a third order term is the minimal condition for the possibility of a vertical phase separation within the brush .",
    "the power series expansion of @xmath21 is clearly related to the virial expansion of the osmotic pressure , @xmath22 .",
    "the two differ in that the second incorporates terms originating in the translational entropy . in discussions of the scf theory @xmath23",

    "these features are useful criteria for the occurrence of vertical phase separation .",
    "such criteria are of interest because of indirect experimental indications that brushes of pnipam exhibit this effect . among these indications",
    "the following are especially noteworthy .",
    "first , is an early study by zhu and napper@xcite of the collapse of pnipam brushes grafted to latex particles immersed in water .",
    "this revealed a collapse involving two stages .",
    "an early collapse , took place below @xmath209 c , at better than @xmath134-conditions , and did not result in flocculation of the neutral particles . upon raising the temperature to worse than @xmath134-conditions",
    "the collapse induced flocculation .",
    "this indicates that the colloidal stabilization imparted by the pnipam brushes survives the early collapse .",
    "it lead to the interpretation of the effect in terms of a vertical phase separation within the brush associated with a second type of phase separation as predicted by the @xmath13-cluster model .",
    "more recently , balamurugan _ _",
    "et al__balamurugan used surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) and contact angle measurements with water to characterize pnipam brushes grafted from  a self - assembled monolayer on gold .",
    "the brush properties were studied at between @xmath210 c and @xmath211 c. the spr measurements indicated gradual variation of the brush properties . in marked contrast , the contact angle measurements revealed an abrupt change at @xmath212 c. both experiments are consistent with a brush undergoing vertical phase separation such that the outer phase is hydrophilic . within this picture ,",
    "the abrupt changes reported in the wetting and aggregation behavior correspond than to the onset of a single , dense and hydrophobic phase .",
    "this picture is also supported by recent study of the phase behavior of pnipam by afroze _",
    "et al_.@xcite early study of the phase behavior of pnipam in water , by heskins and guillet,@xcite identified a lcst at @xmath213 and @xmath214 c. in marked contrast , the work of afroze _ _ et al__@xcite identified pnipam as a polymer undergoing a second type of phase separation . in particular : ( i ) while the lcst of pnipam depends on @xmath4 the lcst occurs around @xmath215 c and @xmath216 ( ii ) in the limit of @xmath217 , the phase separation occurs , depending on @xmath4 , between @xmath209 c and @xmath218 c. thus , the phase diagram of afroze _ et al _ suggests that a vertical phase separation is indeed expected in brushes of pnipam.@xcite systematic neutron reflectometry ( nr ) studies of pnipam brushes will eventually provide clearer picture of the situation .",
    "early studies were hampered by high polydispersity as well as difficulties in determining @xmath4 and @xmath15.@xcite with this in mind , the nr results revealed that the structure of pnipam brushes in acetone was very different from their structure in water , both at @xmath219 c and at @xmath220 c. in acetone the concentration profile was smoothly decaying while in water it consisted of a narrow , inner , dense region and an outer , extended and dilute region .",
    "more recent work utilized nr,@xcite to study samples with lower polydispersity and higher grafting density between @xmath219 c and @xmath211 c. importantly , the results indicate that most of the conformational change occurred between @xmath221 c and @xmath218 c though the corresponding concentration profiles were not reported .",
    "the results suggest a repartitioning of the monomers between a dilute outer tail and an inner dense region.@xcite finally , recent experimental results of hu _ _ at al__@xcite are suggestive of the predictions obtained above concerning the variation of @xmath222 upon decreasing @xmath223 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "et al _ studied the thickness of a pnipam brush grafted to spherical microgels of copolymers of pnipam and acrylic acid 2-hydroxyethyl ester ( hea ) .",
    "the microgels shrink as @xmath1 increases from @xmath224 c to @xmath225 c thus inducing a decrease in @xmath223 .",
    "remarkably , the thickness of the brush initially decreases in the range @xmath226 c to @xmath227 c but subsequently increases upon further heating in the range @xmath226@xmath227 c. unfortunately , in this experiment it is impossible to separate the effects due to change in @xmath1 from those to the change in @xmath223 because the @xmath1 is used to tune @xmath223 .    in confronting experimental results with theoretical predictions concerning the vertical phase separation",
    "it is important to note two points .",
    "first , polydispersity in @xmath4 and in @xmath15 can smooth out the discontinuity in @xmath120 .",
    "these factors give rise to domains with different @xmath80 . in turn",
    ", the altitude of the discontinuity in these domains will also differ .",
    "nr measurements will reflect the weighted average of these domains .",
    "polydispersity in @xmath4 can lead to further strengthening of this effect if @xmath228 depends on @xmath4 .",
    "second , the vertical phase separation involves a first order phase transition .",
    "accordingly , nucleation dynamics may play a role and it is necessary to allow for the possibility of long relaxation times .",
