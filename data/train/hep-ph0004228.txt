    "the nrqcd factorization formalism @xcite can be used to factor the fragmentation functions @xmath4 for quarkonium into nrqcd matrix elements , which can be regarded as phenomenological parameters , and short - distance factors , which depend on @xmath5 and are calculable in perturbation theory .",

    "braaten and yuan showed that it must be included in the gluon fragmentation function for triplet p - wave states in order to avoid an infrared divergence in the short - distance coefficient of the color - singlet matrix element @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "braaten and fleming argued that the @xmath8 term is also phenomenologically necessary in the gluon fragmentation function for spin - triplet s - wave states in order to explain the production rate of direct @xmath10 and @xmath11 at large @xmath3 at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "this led to the remarkable prediction by cho and wise that @xmath10 and @xmath11 at large @xmath3 should be transversely polarized @xcite .    in the earliest calculations of fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonium @xcite ,",
    "the short - distance factors were deduced by comparing the cross sections for quarkonium production with the form predicted by the factorization theorems for inclusive single - hadron production .",
    "however the fragmentation functions can also be defined formally as matrix elements of bilocal operators in a light - cone gauge @xcite or , more generally , as matrix elements of non - local gauge - invariant operators @xcite . the gauge - invariant definition of collins and soper was first applied to calculations of the fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonium by ma @xcite",
