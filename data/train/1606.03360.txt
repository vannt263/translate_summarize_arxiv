    "note that two sides of the mass transport principle can be considered as integrals @xmath21 and @xmath22 for two appropriate ` left ' and ` right ' borel measures @xmath23 on @xmath24 , so @xmath13 is unimodular if and only if @xmath25 .",

    "first , the space @xmath0 provides a convenient universal setting in which to view both finite volume manifolds ( or more generally , measured foliations ) and infinite volume manifolds that have a sufficient amount of symmetry ( e.g.   the transitive examples above ) . more importantly ,",
    "though , interpreting all these examples as measures on a single universal space allows one to define a notion of convergence , for instance of a sequence of finite volume manifolds to a measured foliation , through weak * convergence of the associated measures on @xmath0 .",

    "the first is a geometric reinterpretation of our earlier work with abbgnrs @xcite , where we proved a uniform version of the lck approximation theorem for sequences of lattices in higher rank lie groups @xmath49 .",
    "the second is a version of the rank rigidity theorem of ballmann @xcite and burns ",
    "spatzier  @xcite that applies to finite volume manifolds @xmath2 where control on the geometry is only given over a large proportion of @xmath2 .",
    "much of our work is inspired by a recent program in graph theory , in particular work of aldous - lyons @xcite and benjamini - schramm @xcite .",
    "for instance , the term ` unimodularity ' was previously used in @xcite , for measures @xmath13 on the space @xmath50 such that for any borel function @xmath51 on the space of doubly rooted graphs , @xmath52 in fact , this version of the mass transport principle appeared even earlier in @xcite , generalizing a concept important in percolation theory @xcite .",
    "as in example [ finvolex ] , every finite graph @xmath49 gives a unimodular measure @xmath53 on @xmath54 , by pushing forward the counting measure on its vertices under the map @xmath55 similarly , a transitive graph gives a unimodular measure on @xmath54 if and only if its automorphism group is unimodular , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.2 ) .",
    "one can study unimodular measures on @xmath56 that are weak * limits of the @xmath53 , c.f.@xcite , and extending results known for finite graphs to arbitrary unimodular measures on @xmath54 has recently become a small industry , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "ideas similar to ours have also appeared previously in the continuous setting , even apart from abbgnrs @xcite .",
    "most directly , bowen @xcite used unimodular measures on the space of pointed metric measure spaces to bound the cheeger constants of hyperbolic @xmath57-manifolds with free fundamental group . in his thesis , lessa @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite , studied measures on @xmath0 that are stationary under brownian motion , of which unimodular measures are examples , @xcite and @xcite . also , see benjamini ",
    "curien @xcite for a corresponding theory of stationary random graphs . ] , and a few of the technical parts of this paper are similar to parts of his .",
    "namazi - panka - souto  @xcite , analyzed weak*-limits of the measures @xmath58 for sequences @xmath59 of manifolds that are all quasi - conformal deformations of a fixed closed manifold and that all have bounded geometry . also , vadim kaimanovich has for some time promoted measured foliations from a viewpoint similar to ours , and we refer the reader to his papers @xcite for culture .",
    "candel , lvarez lpez and barral lij @xcite have independently and concurrently studied the space @xmath0 , proving that it is polish and establishing a number of interesting topological properties that are very related to this paper , e.g.  to proposition [ leafborel ] .",
    "their proof that @xmath0 is polish was made publicly available well before ours , so the result is theirs .",
    "however , even though the two approaches are quite similar , our proof produces an explicit metric that we use elsewhere in the paper , so we still present it here .",
    "finally , in a sequel to @xcite , lvarez lpez and barral lij  @xcite independently prove a desingularization theorem similar to theorem  [ desingularizing ] , which they use to show that any manifold with bounded geometry can be realized isometrically as a leaf in a compact riemannian foliated space .",
    "as their goals are topological , rather than measure theoretic , their foliated space is not set up so that one can lift measures on @xmath0 to the foliated space using poisson processes , though , a property that is crucial in our applications .",
    "[ motivation ]      most of the paper concerns the structure theory of unimodular measures .",
    "the case where @xmath13 is a unimodular probability measure is of particular interest : a @xmath13-random element of @xmath0 is then called a _ unimodular random manifold _ ( urm ) . in this section , we will start by explaining the close relationship between unimodular measures and completely invariant measures on foliated spaces , as mentioned in example [ foliationex ] .",
    "then , we will outline the dictionary between _ invariant random subgroups _ and unimodular random locally symmetric spaces . as an interesting trip to the zoo ,",
    "a characterization of unimodular random hyperbolic @xmath60 and @xmath3-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is given .",
    "we then discuss conditions under which sets of unimodular measures on @xmath0 are weak * compact , and finish with a discussion of the rather long appendix , where it is shown that @xmath0 and various related spaces have reasonable topology .",
    "the next section ,  [ applications ] , presents two applications of our machinery to finite volume manifolds .      as mentioned above ,",
    "a separable , metrizable space @xmath27 is a _ foliated space _ if it is a union of leaves that fit together locally as the horizontal factors in a product @xmath36 for some transversal space @xmath37 .",
    "we say @xmath27 is _ riemannian _ if the leaves all have riemannian metrics , and if these metrics vary smoothly in the transverse direction .",
    "see  [ foliatedsec ] for details .",
    "on such an @xmath27 , let @xmath61 be the leaf through @xmath62 .",
    "a @xmath63-finite borel measure @xmath13 on @xmath27 is _ unimodular _ if for every nonnegative borel @xmath64 we have : @xmath65 also , a measure @xmath13 on @xmath27 is called _ completely invariant _ if it is obtained by integrating the riemannian measures on the leaves of @xmath27 against some invariant transverse measure , see  [ foliatedsec ] and @xcite .",
    "we then have :    [ foliationsintro ] suppose that @xmath30 is a riemannian foliated space and @xmath66 is a @xmath12-finite borel measure on @xmath27",
    ". then the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath13 is completely invariant , 2 .",
    "@xmath66 is unimodular , 3 .",
    "@xmath66 lifts uniformly to a measure @xmath67 on the leaf - wise unit tangent bundle @xmath68 that is invariant under leaf - wise geodesic flow .    to understand the ` uniform lift ' in 3 ) , take a measure @xmath13 on @xmath27 , and integrate @xmath13 against the ( round ) riemannian measures on all leaf - wise tangent spheres @xmath69 to get a measure @xmath67 on @xmath68 .",
    "a version of this condition will reappear below as an alternative characterization of unimodularity for measures on @xmath70 theorem [ foliationsintro ] is proved in  [ foliatedsec ] , where it is restated as theorem  [ foliations ] .",
    "two additional characterizations of unimodularity are included in the new statement , one of which parallels a well - known result in graph theory .    in some sense , the space @xmath0 is itself almost foliated , where the ` leaves ' are the subsets obtained by fixing a manifold @xmath35 and varying the basepoint @xmath71 .",
    "one would like to say that unimodular measures are just completely invariant measures , with respect to this foliation .",
    "however , due to the equivalence relation defining @xmath0 , these ` leaves ' are actually of the form @xmath72 , so the foliation is highly singular , and complete invariance does not make sense .    however , there is a way to make this point of view precise . recall that if @xmath27 is any riemannian foliated space , its _ leaf map",
    "_ takes @xmath73 to the pointed riemannian manifold @xmath74 , where @xmath39 is the leaf through @xmath40 .",
    "we then have :    [ desingularizing ] if @xmath13 is a completely invariant probability measure on a riemannian foliated space @xmath27 , then @xmath13 pushes forward under the leaf map to a unimodular probability measure @xmath75 on @xmath41 .",
    "conversely , there is a polish riemannian foliated space @xmath76 such that any @xmath12-finite unimodular measure on @xmath41 is the push forward under the leaf map of some completely invariant measure on @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , for any fixed manifold @xmath35 , the preimage of @xmath78 under the leaf map is a union of leaves of @xmath79 , each of which is isometric to @xmath35 .",
    "this theorem indicates an advantage our continuous framework has over graph theory : although the mass transport principle does indicate a compatibility between unimodular measures on @xmath54 and the counting measures on the vertex sets of fixed graphs @xmath49 , there is no precise statement saying that unimodular measures are made by locally integrating up these counting measures in analogy with theorem [ desingularizing ] . in some sense , the problem is that graphs do not have enough local structure for this perspective to translate .",
    "the idea behind the construction of @xmath79 is simple .",
    "since the problem is that riemannian manifolds may have nontrivial isometries , we set @xmath79 to be the set of isometry classes of triples @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a base point and @xmath82 is a closed subset such that there is no isometry @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the leaves are obtained by fixing @xmath2 and @xmath85 and varying @xmath62 , and the leaf map is just the projection @xmath86 .",
    "however , it takes some work to see that these leaves fit together locally into a product structure @xmath36 : a brief sketch of this argument is given in the beginning of  [ proofpdsec ] . assuming this , though",
    ", measures on @xmath0 induce measures on @xmath79 after integrating against a poisson process on each fiber of the leaf map .",
    "see  [ pdsec ] for details .",
    "completely invariant measures on foliated spaces have been well studied , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "as we will see in  [ applications ] , the fact that all unimodular measures come from foliations is useful : for instance , one can take a sequence of finite volume manifolds @xmath59 , pass to the associated unimodular probability measures @xmath58 , extract a weak * limit measure @xmath13 , study this @xmath13 using tools from foliations , and deduce results about the manifolds @xmath87 .    for those working in foliations , the mass transport principle may seem less interesting now that we know unimodularity can also be characterized in terms of complete invariance .",
    "however , we would like to stress that often , the mtp is the more convenient definition to use .",
    "we illustrate this in theorem  [ hypcompact ] , where we use the mtp to give a proof of weak * compactness of the set of unimodular measures supported on manifolds with pinched negative curvature . for another example",
    ", biringer - raimbault @xcite have studied the space of ends of a unimodular random manifold , showing for example that it has either @xmath88 or @xmath60 elements , or is a cantor set .",
    "this parallels a result of ghys @xcite on the topology of generic leaves of a measured foliation .",
    "neither of these results quite implies the other , although ghys s result is really more general , as it applies to harmonic measures , and not just completely invariant ones .",
    "however , the mtp encapsulates a recurrence that makes the proof in @xcite extremely short .",
    "one other reason to prefer unimodularity in our setting is that to talk about complete invariance , one must leave @xmath0 , passing to an associated foliated space using the desingularization theorem . on the other hand ,",
    "the geodesic flow invariance of theorem  [ foliationsintro ] can be phrased ( more or less ) directly within @xmath0 .",
    "[ gflow ] suppose that @xmath66 is a borel measure on @xmath0",
    ". then @xmath66 is unimodular if and only if its uniform lift @xmath67 on @xmath89 is geodesic flow invariant .",
    "see  [ pdsec ] for the proof . here , @xmath89 is the space of isometry classes of rooted unit tangent bundles @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "each fiber @xmath92 of @xmath93 comes with a natural riemannian metric induced by the inner product on @xmath94 , and we write @xmath95 for the associated riemannian measure on @xmath96 . then @xmath67 is the measure on @xmath97 defined by the equation @xmath98 the geodesic flows on individual @xmath99 combine to give a continuous flow @xmath100 and this is the geodesic flow referenced in the statement of the theorem .",
    "this theorem is an analogue of a result in graph theory . the space @xmath101 of graphs with a distinguished oriented edge projects onto @xmath102 , where the map replaces a distinguished edge with its original vertex .",
    "for each @xmath103 , the uniform probability measure on the set of @xmath1 edges originating at @xmath104 quotients to a probability measure on the fiber over @xmath105 in @xmath101 . integrating these fiber measures against @xmath13 gives a measure @xmath106 on @xmath107 , and aldous - lyons @xcite proved that @xmath66 is unimodular if and only if @xmath106 is invariant under the map @xmath108 that switches the orientation of the distinguished edge .",
    "we now focus on unimodular probability measures @xmath13 on @xmath0 , in which case a @xmath13-random element of @xmath0 is called a _ unimodular random manifold _ ( urm ) .",
    "there is a close relationship between urms and _ invariant random subgroups _ ( irss ) , which have been studied in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath109 be a locally compact , second countable group , and let @xmath110 be the space of closed subgroups of @xmath49 , endowed with its _ chabauty topology _ , see [ chabautysection ] .",

    "@xmath111-labeled graph _ is a countable directed graph with edges labeled by elements of @xmath111 , such that the edges coming out from any given vertex @xmath104 have labels in 1 - 1 correspondence with elements of @xmath111 , and the same is true for the labels of edges coming into @xmath104 .",
    "every subgroup @xmath112 determines an @xmath111-labeled _ schreier graph _ @xmath113 , whose vertices are right cosets @xmath114 and where each @xmath115 contributes a labeled edge from every coset @xmath114 to @xmath116 .",
    "note that @xmath113 comes with a natural base point , the identity coset @xmath117 .    in a variation of the discussion in ",
    "[ motivation ] , let @xmath118 be the space of isomorphism classes of rooted @xmath119-labeled graphs . a ursg is a random element of @xmath118 with respect to a probability measure that satisfies the appropriate @xmath111-labeled analogue of the mass transport principle . a random subgroup @xmath120 determines a random rooted schreier graph , and conjugation invariance of the distribution of @xmath121 is equivalent to unimodularity of @xmath113 .",
    "so , irss of @xmath49 exactly correspond to ursgs .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details .    in the continuous setting ,",
    "irss were first studied in abbgnrs @xcite . in analogy with the above , when a group @xmath109 acts on @xmath27 by isometries",

    "two parts of this dictionary are discussed in  [ unimodularirs ] , in the cases where @xmath109 acts transitively , or discretely on @xmath30 .",

    "[ urmirsintro ] suppose @xmath30 is a simply connected riemannian manifold whose isometry group is unimodular and acts transitively .",

    ".    see  [ hypcompactsec ] for a more precise statement .",
    "the condition on the derivatives of curvature is only necessary because we consider @xmath0 with the smooth topology ; a topology of weaker regularity would require weaker assumptions . essentially , the reason the injectivity radius assumption is not necessary is because in pinched negative curvature , the @xmath138-thin part of a manifold takes up at most some uniform proportion @xmath139 of the total volume , where @xmath140 as @xmath141 .",
