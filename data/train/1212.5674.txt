    "in the last few decades great progress has been made in the understanding of how low - mass stars form , through multi - wavelength observations and detailed theoretical models .",
    "it is now relatively well understood that during the early stages of evolution of low - mass stars , a system is formed with a central protostar , surrounded by a rotating accretion disk at scales of @xmath3 100 au , and ejecting a highly collimated jet along the polar axis of the disk .",
    "while the disk is the reservoir from which the protostar accretes further matter , the ejected outflow removes angular momentum and magnetic flux from the system , allowing the accretion to proceed until the central star is assembled ( e.g. , lada 1995 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; machida , inutsuka & matsumoto 2008 ; armitage 2011 ; williams & cieza 2011 ) .",
    "however , the processes that give rise to massive stars ( @xmath5 8  m@xmath6 ) are still not well understood .",
    "several well differentiated mechanisms for forming massive stars have been proposed .",
    "for example , via an accretion disk ( as low - mass stars , but with a higher accretion rate ) , via competitive accretion in a protocluster environment , or via mergers in very dense systems of lower mass stars ( bally & zinnecker , 2005 ) .",
    "distinguishing between these possible scenarios is a very difficult observational task , essentially because massive young stars are rare and more distant compared to low - mass young stars .",
    "furthermore , massive stars form in clusters in highly obscured regions , making it difficult to identify individual massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) for detailed studies ( see , e.g. , hoare & franco 2007 ; hoare et al . 2007 ; zinnecker & yorke 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "in this sense , recent interferometer observations at cm and ( sub)mm wavelengths with angular resolutions of @xmath3 0.1@xmath7 ( @xmath3 100 au at 1 kpc distance ) suggest that stars with masses at least up to @xmath3 20  m@xmath6 may form via the accretion disk scenario , in a similar way as low - mass stars do , although the number of massive disk - protostar - jet systems identified and studied at scales of @xmath3 1000 au is still very small ( e.g. , patel et al . 2005 ; jimnez - serra et al . 2007 ; torrelles et al . 2007 ; zapata et al . 2009 ; davies et al . 2010 ; carrasco - gonzlez et al . 2010 , 2012 ;",
    "fernndez - lpez et al .",
    "2011 ) .    within this context , observations of maser transitions of several molecular species ( e.g. , h@xmath8o , oh , ch@xmath9oh ) in the proximity of high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) provide a powerful diagnostic tool to investigate the first stages of the evolution of massive star formation ( e.g. , sanna et al .",
    "2010a , b ; bartkiewicz & van langevelde 2012 ) . in particular , the use of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques for observing maser emission with angular resolution @xmath10  mas ( @xmath10  au at 1  kpc distance ) , allows us to study some of the main properties of the densest and hence most obscured portions of molecular clouds where the new massive stars are born .",
    "in addition , it is possible to derive the three - dimensional ( 3d ) velocity distribution of the masing gas very close to hmpos ( e.g. , goddi et al .",
    "2006 ; matthews et al . 2010 ; goddi , moscadelli & sanna 2011 ; torrelles et al . 2011 ; chibueze et al .",
    "2012 ) , and through polarization measurements , the distribution and strength of the magnetic field in the cores of star forming regions ( e.g. , vlemmings et al . 2006 , 2010 ; surcis et al .",
    "2011a , b , 2012 ) .",
    "moreover , the detection of outflow activity by means of vlbi maser observations also allows us to identify new , previously unseen centers of massive star formation , some of them associated with unexpected phenomena such as  short - lived \" episodic ejection events characterized by kinematic ages of a few tens of years in the earliest stages of evolution of hmpos ( torrelles et al . 2001 , 2003 , 2011 ; gallimore et al .",

    "the short kinematic age of the expanding motions traced by the water masers ( few tens of years ) also led these authors to suggest that they are probably the result of recurrent pulsed jet events rather than of a steady jet from the central protostar(s ) .",
    "therefore , this could represent an important new case providing indications that massive objects are characterized by recurrent outflow events during the early stages of their evolution ( e.g. mart et al 1995 ; curiel et al . 2006 ) .    in this paper we present (  2 ) vlbi",

    "our data show a water maser spatio - kinematical distribution that is globally consistent with that reported from the 2008 - 2009 epoch data , but less extended and smoother .",
    "we analyze the 3-d kinematical and spatial distribution of the maser structures following their evolution during the time span of 7 years (  3 ) , modeling the formation and evolution of these maser structures in terms of two possible scenarios : ( 1 ) a single static central massive yso , ejecting a jet driving the two bow - shock maser structures ; ( 2 ) two embedded driving sources , one exciting the northern bow shock , and the other one a young runaway star moving in the local medium at @xmath3 20  km  s@xmath4 and exciting the smoother southern bow - shock structure observed in our data (  4 ) .",

    "it follows that @xmath79 taking the @xmath53 mas@xmath4 value deduced from the observed bow shapes ( see table [ tabfits ] ) , we then obtain @xmath80 for a distance of 3.3 kpc .",

    "as expected , for @xmath89 there is no information about the bow - shock velocity .",
    "interestingly , the position of the star with respect to the observed bow - shock tip ( @xmath87 ) is limited to a range between 4.7 and 5.6 mas ( for all values of @xmath88 ) .",
    "the narrowness of this interval is a consequence of the weak dependence of @xmath87 on the orientation angle @xmath88 ( see equation [ rp5 ] ) .    to estimate the stellar wind parameters",

    ". future searches with higher sensitivity of the emission from this source will show whether or not our bow - shock model works well in its present form .",
    "it is important to note that a detailed model was not made for the water masers tracing the northern bow - shock structure .",
    "as it has been mentioned , these masers are not showing a remarkably smooth morphology ; instead , they are tracing an structure with a somewhat irregular morphology , opening the possibility that it is excited by another different yso and in a possibly more turbulent region .",
    "we have performed and analyzed multi - epoch vlba water maser observations toward the high - mass star forming region afgl 2591 with an angular resolution of 0.45 mas .",
    "clusters of masers were detected toward the massive ysos vla2 , vla 3 , and @xmath3 0.5@xmath7 ( @xmath3 1700 au ) north of vla 3 , identifying a new center(s ) of star formation by its outflow activity ( vla 3-n ) .",
    "the water maser emission in vla 3-n is distributed in the form of two bow shock - like structures separated from each other by @xmath3 100  mas ( @xmath3 330 au ) .",
    "the northern bow shock - like structure is moving essentially northward , while the southern one is moving southward .",
    "these water maser structures observed in epochs 2001 - 2002 are contained within the area circumscribed by the corresponding structures observed by sanna et al .",

    "we find that , while the northern bow shock - like structure has a somewhat irregular morphology , the southern one has a remarkably smooth morphology .",
    "we have considered two alternative scenarios to explain these structures : ( 1 ) a single , static yso ejecting a jet , and driving the two bow shock - like structures and ( 2 ) at least two ysos , each of them exciting one of the structures .",
    "in particular , we made a detailed modeling for the southern structure and found that its spatio - kinematical distribution fits very well with a bow shock with a time - independent shape .",
    "we have modeled this bow shock as the interaction of an isotropic stellar wind from a runaway yso with an homogeneous , streaming environment .",
