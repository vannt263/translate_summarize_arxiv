    "the recent atmospheric neutrino data from the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment @xcite can be beautifully explained through flavor oscillations generated by nonzero neutrino mass and mixing @xcite in the @xmath2 channel @xcite .",
    "such interpretation is consistent with all the sk data , including sub - gev @xmath11-like and @xmath12-like events ( sg@xmath13 ) @xcite , multi - gev @xmath11-like and @xmath12-like events ( mg@xmath13 ) @xcite , and upward - going muon events ( up@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "a combined analysis of the 33 kty sk data sample can be found in @xcite .",
    "the oscillation hypothesis has been strengthened by the latest ( preliminary ) 45 kty sk data sample @xcite , and is also consistent with independent atmospheric neutrino results from the macro @xcite and soudan-2 @xcite experiments , as well as with the finalized upward - going muon data from the pioneering kamiokande experiment @xcite .",
    "establishing @xmath2 oscillations generated by nonzero @xmath14 mass and mixing as the `` standard '' interpretation requires , however , further data and analyses . basically , the following three aspects should be clarified : ( 1 ) the periodicity ; ( 2 ) the flavors ; and ( 3 ) the dynamics .",
    "so far , the periodicity of the @xmath15 oscillation pattern has not been experimentally observed in the neutrino energy @xmath16 or pathlength @xmath17 domain , and it is unlikely to emerge from the sk lepton distributions , largely smeared in energy or angle .",
    "although specific nonperiodic scenarios , such as neutrino decay @xcite , can be indirectly excluded by careful analyses of sk data @xcite , the direct observation of a periodic disappearance pattern of @xmath15 s remains an important goal for future atmospheric and long - baseline neutrino experiments .    besides periodicity",
    ", one should also identify unambiguously the flavor(s ) of the oscillating partner(s ) of @xmath15 s because , in principle , all oscillation channels into active or sterile neutrinos might be open ( @xmath2 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . while the amplitude of possible @xmath18 transitions is bound to be small @xcite",
    ", one can not exclude @xmath19 oscillations with large amplitude with present sk data @xcite .",
    "however , based on the fact that different oscillation channels induce somewhat different energy - angle lepton distributions , there are good prospects for a significant ( @xmath20 ) discrimination of @xmath2 from @xmath19 with future sk data @xcite .    in this work",
    "we assume that both the periodicity ( i.e. , the existence of an oscillation length @xmath1 ) and the oscillating flavors ( @xmath21 ) are established , and we rather focus on the third aspect to be clarified : the dynamical origin of @xmath2 oscillations .",
    "the standard oscillation dynamics , involving a nontrivial @xmath22 neutrino mass matrix , leads to a well - known energy dependence of @xmath1 , @xmath23 however , possible nonstandard neutrino interactions or properties can also generate ( or coexist with ) @xmath2 oscillations @xcite .",
    "an incomplete list of possibilities include violations of the equivalence principle ( vep ) @xcite , flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) ( see @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) , neutrino couplings to space - time torsion fields @xcite , neutrino interactions through charged scalar particles @xcite , nonrelativistic heavy neutrinos @xcite , violations of lorentz invariance ( vli ) @xcite and of cpt symmetry @xcite . in several such models",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath1 takes a power - law form @xcite , @xmath24    although models with exotic dynamics for @xmath2 oscillations do not survive occam s razor , they might survive experimental tests !",
    "effective tests must cover the widest possible energy range , as evident from eqs .",
    "( [ std ] ) and ( [ nonstd ] ) .",
    "concerning atmospheric neutrinos , pre - sk data analyses covered only about two decades in energy ( i.e. , the so - called contained events , @xmath25@xmath26 gev ) , and were compatible with several nonstandard scenarios , in particular with the vep hypothesis ( corresponding to @xmath27 ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting post - sk analysis , covering a slightly more extended energy range @xcite , does not appear to discriminate significantly the three cases @xmath28 and @xmath29 examined .",
    "however , as observed in @xcite , a much longer `` lever arm '' in the energy domain is provided by the inclusion of partially contained and upward - going muon events ( up to @xmath30 gev ) , thus providing a powerful tool to test exotic scenarios ( which , indeed , appear to be disfavored in general @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we assess quantitatively the situation for @xmath2 models with power - law energy dependence of the oscillation length ( @xmath3 ) , including , as relevant subcases , standard mass - mixing oscillations @xmath4 and violations of the equivalence principle or of lorentz invariance @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain two basic results : ( 1 ) the 90% c.l .",
    "range of @xmath7 is determined to be @xmath8 , which is in striking agreement with standard oscillations , and excludes all @xmath31 models as dominant sources of @xmath2 transitions ; ( 2 ) assuming the @xmath27 case as a subleading mechanism ( coexisting with leading standard oscillations ) , we place stringent upper bounds on its amplitude . such bounds can be interpreted as upper limits to violations of special or general relativity principles .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we analyze models with generic @xmath3 behavior , and constrain @xmath7 through fits to sk atmospheric @xmath14 data . in sec .",
    "iii we consider a more complicated case with two coexisting sources for oscillations , namely , neutrino masses and violations of relativity principles .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .  iv .",
    "in this section , we first review some oscillation models with @xmath1 depending on @xmath0 through a power law",
    ". then , independently of specific models , we study the phenomenology of atmospheric @xmath14 s , and constrain the energy exponent @xmath7 through detailed fits to the sk data .",
    "typical two - flavor hamiltonians for @xmath2 oscillations predict a flavor transition probability of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the rotation ( mixing ) angle between the flavor basis and the basis where the hamiltonian is diagonal , @xmath35 is the neutrino pathlength , and @xmath1 is the neutrino oscillation length . in several cases of interest , @xmath1 depends on the neutrino energy @xmath0 as @xcite @xmath36 with the exponent @xmath7 taking integer ( positive or negative ) values .",
    "for instance , the cases @xmath37 , 0 and 1 arise , respectively , in the presence of neutrino interactions mediated by scalar , vector , and tensor fields @xcite .",

    "equation ( [ b ] ) refers to possible violations of the equivalence principle ( vep ) @xcite , namely , to nonuniversal couplings of neutrinos to the gravitational potential @xmath43 .",
    "the difference in such couplings is usually denoted by @xmath44 , and the mixing angle by @xmath45 .",
    "the potential seems to be dominated by the local supercluster ( @xmath46 @xcite ) , but ambiguities in its definition suggest to use the product @xmath47 as a single , dimensionless free parameter , rather than @xmath43 and @xmath44 separately ( see @xcite for recent discussions ) .",
    "the energy exponent of vep - induced oscillations is @xmath27",
    ". rather than @xmath27 , has been recently considered in @xcite .",
    "its phenomenology would be indistinguishable from the standard case , as far as @xmath2 oscillations are involved .",
    "we do not consider such vep scenario in this work . ]",
    "equation ( [ c ] ) refers to possible violations of lorentz invariance ( vli ) , namely , to asymptotic neutrino velocities different from @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 represents the speed difference in units of @xmath48 .",
    "the mixing angle is usually denoted as @xmath50 . since the energy exponent @xmath7 is the same ( @xmath51 ) in both the vep and the vli scenario , such mechanisms are phenomenologically equivalent through the substitutions @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ d ] ) refers to possible violations of the cpt symmetry through a more general class of lorentz - violating perturbations @xcite , @xmath54 being proportional to the cpt - odd hamiltonian producing energy independent @xmath5 oscillations .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the most general hamiltonian considered in @xcite encompasses the three scenarios with @xmath37 , 0 and 1 .",
    "finally , eq .  ( [ e ] ) refers to possible nonuniversal couplings @xmath55 of neutrinos to a space - time torsion field of strength @xmath56 @xcite , which also produce energy - independent oscillations .    in principle , several oscillation mechanisms with different @xmath7 s might occur at the same time , with corresponding complications in the analysis . in the next two subsections , however , we consider only one mechanism at a time .",
    "we will discuss the interesting case of coexisting @xmath37 plus @xmath57 oscillations in sec .",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "not all `` exotic '' models for @xmath2 transitions can be parametrized as in eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "an important exception is represented by fcnc - induced oscillations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , although the fcnc oscillation phase is energy - independent @xmath5 , it is proportional to the column density of electrons rather than to @xmath35",
    ". therefore , fcnc - induced oscillations deserve a separate analysis @xcite and will be considered in a future work . however",
    ", some features of the @xmath28 case also apply qualitatively to the fcnc case .",
    "finally , we note in passing that the analysis of nonstandard energy dependences for @xmath14 oscillations has some correspondence in the neutral kaon system , where the role of @xmath1 is played by the effective @xmath58@xmath59 mass difference ( see @xcite and references therein ) .      in this section we do not commit ourselves to any specific model , and rather analyze the phenomenology of the @xmath3 dependence in the most general way .",
    "we assume that the @xmath2 oscillation probability takes the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an overall scale factor ( @xmath62 ) for the oscillation amplitude , @xmath63 is an unconstrained scale factor for the oscillation phase , and @xmath7 is a free exponent ( not necessarily equal to @xmath64 , 0 , or 1 ) .",
    "the units in eq .",
    "( [ psk ] ) have been conveniently chosen on the basis of the current super - kamiokande data , which suggest an oscillation length of @xmath65 for neutrino energies of @xmath66 .",
    "the standard oscillation case is recovered by taking @xmath37 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "equation  ( [ psk ] ) is used to calculate the observable rates of sub - gev , multi - gev , and upward through - going muon events in sk as a function of the lepton zenith angle @xmath42 , using the same detailed and accurate approach as in refs .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for technical details .",
    "here we just remind that the parent neutrino distributions for sub - gev ( sg ) , multi - gev fully contained ( mg  fc ) , multi - gev partially contained ( mg  pc ) , and upward through - going ( up ) muon events are roughly distributed in the ranges @xmath69@xmath70 gev , @xmath71@xmath26 gev , @xmath71@xmath72 gev , and @xmath26@xmath73 gev , respectively , thus covering about four decades in @xmath0 .",
    "figure  1 shows the expected zenith distributions of sg@xmath12 , mg@xmath12 ( fc+pc ) , and up@xmath12 events in super - kamiokande for maximal mixing ( @xmath74 ) and for three representative values of @xmath63 : dotted line , @xmath75 ; dashed line , @xmath76 ; solid line , @xmath77 ( on color printers such lines appear in green , red , and blue , respectively ) . in each bin , the muon rates @xmath12 are normalized to the expectations @xmath78 in the absence of oscillations , so that deviations from the no - oscillation case ( @xmath79 ) are immediately recognizable .",
    "since we are considering pure @xmath2 oscillations ( @xmath80 always ) , the electron rates are not shown .",
    "the effect of taking @xmath81 can be approximately described by reducing proportionally the amount of muon disappearance in each subfigure .",
    "the theoretical expectations are affected by relatively large and strongly correlated uncertainties ( not shown ) , mainly related to the overall normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "the 45 kty sk data @xcite ( dots with statistical error bars ) are superposed to guide the eye , although no fit to the data is implied by this figure .    in fig .  1",
    ", from top to bottom , the energy exponent @xmath7 takes the values @xmath82 , @xmath64 , 0 , and 1 , corresponding to a dependence of the kind @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath35 , and @xmath85 for the oscillation phase .",
    "such four cases are described in the following .",
    "_ case @xmath83 . _ this case ( @xmath82 ) does not correspond to any known model , and is used only to extend the study to a power - law energy dependence faster than in the standard case ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the muons appear to be significantly suppressed at the lowest ( sg ) energies , the more the larger @xmath63 . an excessive suppression of sg muons is avoided only by keeping @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "such values of @xmath63 are too low to produce a significant suppression of mg muons , which rather prefer @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , one expects a `` compromise '' between underestimated sg@xmath12 rate and overestimated mg@xmath12 rates for @xmath63 in the range @xmath88@xmath89 .",
    "up@xmath12 events are basically unsuppressed , due to their high energy .",
    "reducing @xmath61 would be of no help in reducing the conflict between sg and mg muon expectations .",
    "_ case @xmath84 .",
    "_ this is the `` standard '' oscillation case , which , as well known , provides and excellent description of the sk data for @xmath90 ev@xmath91 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising to see in fig .  1 that , for values of @xmath63 in the range @xmath92@xmath89 , all the muon data are well reproduced .",
    "higher values of @xmath63 would suppress sg muons too much , while lower values would not produce enough suppression at higher energies ( mg@xmath12 and up@xmath12 samples ) .",
    "_ case @xmath35 .",
    "_ in this case , the @xmath15 survival probability is energy independent , and the differences in the muon suppression patterns among the sg , mg and up muon samples are mainly due to the different angular smearing . at low ( sg ) energies",
    "the smearing is very effective and there is little difference between the three curves , while higher - energy , mg muons are more discriminating .",
    "values of @xmath63 around unity ( dashed curve ) seem to be preferred by sg+mg data , and produce a significant @xmath93 suppression below the horizon .",
    "up muons have a different suppression pattern , which is highly correlated with the parent neutrino direction , and follows closely the variations of @xmath94 with @xmath35 ( dashed and dotted curves ) , until the oscillations are so fast to be unresolved within the bin width ( solid curve ) .",
    "the expected up@xmath12 suppression appears to be larger than suggested by the data , unless @xmath61 is taken to be nonmaximal ; however , for @xmath81 the relatively good description of sg+mg data would be spoiled ( not shown ) .",
    "_ case @xmath85 .",
    "_ in this case , the @xmath15 survival probability rapidly approaches the average value @xmath95 as the energy increases .",
    "therefore , although sg+mg data can be described relatively well with @xmath74 and @xmath96 , the expected up@xmath12 rates are too low in any case . as in the previous @xmath28 scenario , taking @xmath81 would help to reproduce the up@xmath12 data , but would worsen the description of sg+mg data .",
    "no satisfactory compromise can be reached .",
    "in all the four cases , it can be seen that sg ( or even sg+mg ) data alone do not discriminate strongly among the various scenarios , since they do not probe the full energy range explorable by sk .",
    "this might explain why the sg+mg analysis in @xcite could not significantly distinguish the three cases @xmath37 , 0 , and 1 .",
    "the inclusion of up@xmath12 data extends the range up to @xmath30 gev , and provides a very important tool to probe the energy dependence of @xmath1 @xcite .    in conclusion , from the examination and the comparison of the oscillated muon distributions at different values of @xmath7 shown in fig .  1",
    ", the case @xmath37 emerges as a good description of the sk data at all energies , while for @xmath9 the patterns of muon suppression at low ( sg ) , intermediate ( mg ) and high ( up ) energies appear to be in conflict with the data .      the qualitative understanding of the muon distributions at different values of @xmath7 ( previous subsection ) can be improved by performing quantitative fits to the 45 kty preliminary sk data @xcite .",
    "we use a @xmath97 approach that , as described in @xcite , takes into account several sources of correlation among the systematics affecting the theoretical predictions .",
    "even if @xmath98 s do not participate to oscillation in the scenarios considered here , we have included the sg and mg @xmath11-like data in the analysis ( for a total of 30 data points ) , since they play an important role in constraining the overall normalization uncertainty ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the best - fit zenith distributions of muons for the four cases considered in fig .  1 ( @xmath82 , @xmath64 , 0 , and 1 ) , as obtained by leaving @xmath61 and @xmath63 unconstrained .",
    "the values of @xmath61 , @xmath63 , and @xmath97 at the best - fit points are reported in the top part of the figure .",
    "the @xmath84 ( @xmath37 ) case provides an excellent fit to the data ( @xmath99 ) , while all the other cases do not provide a good description of at least one data sample ( sg@xmath12 , mg@xmath12 , or up@xmath12 ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath82 there is insufficient up - down asymmetry of mg@xmath12 s and no slope of up@xmath12 s ; for @xmath28 none of the zenith distributions is correctly reproduced ; for @xmath27 there is a too strong and flat suppression of up@xmath12 s .    in fig .",
    "3 we present the @xmath97 curve as obtained by taking also @xmath7 as a free parameter , besides @xmath61 and @xmath63 . although noninteger values of @xmath7 may not be related to any realistic oscillation dynamics , this exercise is useful to see how accurately @xmath7 is determined through the sk data .",
    "the result is striking : @xmath100 ( corresponding to @xmath101 for @xmath102 ) .",
    "this narrow range for @xmath7 is perfectly consistent with standard ( @xmath37 ) neutrino oscillations , and inconsistent with any other integer value of @xmath7 .    given the importance of standard @xmath2 oscillations , we show in fig .  4 the updated limits on the oscillation parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we find the best fit at @xmath105 ev@xmath91 and maximal mixing .",
    "the bounds in fig .",
    "4 are in good agreement with the latest full data analysis from the sk collaboration @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "standard oscillations @xmath106 are strongly favored as the _ dominant _ mechanism for the @xmath2 flavor transitions of atmospheric neutrinos in sk .",
    "alternative mechanisms of the kind @xmath107 ( with @xmath108 _ can not _ be the dominant source of muon disappearance in sk . in particular , violations of special or general relativity principles ( vli or vpe , leading to @xmath109 ) can not explain the bulk of sk atmospheric @xmath14 data . therefore , if @xmath31 oscillations occur in nature , they can only be subleading processes with small amplitude , coexisting with leading , large - amplitude @xmath37 standard oscillations .",
    "such results generalize and refine previous indications that sk data could disfavor some exotic models @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider a more complicated case , characterized by leading @xmath37 oscillations plus subleading @xmath57 oscillations , possibly generated by violations of relativity principles ( vep or vli ) .",
    "we show that the fit to the sk data is not improved with respect to the case of standard @xmath2 transitions . as a consequence ,",
    "we derive upper bounds on such violations .",
    "a brief review of the theoretical formalism precedes the phenomenological analysis .",
    "the theory and phenomenology of neutrino violations of the equivalence principle ( vep ) @xcite have been investigated in a number of papers , including studies of the solar @xmath14 deficit @xcite , of the atmospheric @xmath14 anomaly @xcite , of oscillation searches at short baseline @xcite and long baseline @xcite accelerator facilities , and of double beta decay @xcite .",
    "given the phenomenological equivalence of violations of lorentz invariance ( vli ) @xcite and of the equivalence principle ( vep ) @xcite , neutrino oscillation searches can be generally interpreted as tests of fundamental principles of both special and general relativity , with a sensitivity at levels below @xmath110 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we focus on the case of vep or vli induced oscillations coexisting with standard oscillations .",

    "we have found that , in any case , the value of @xmath162 is not smaller than in the best - fit standard case . therefore , standard+vep ( or standard+vli ) oscillations never represent a better description of the sk data , as compared to best - fit standard oscillations . under the above variations , the upper bounds shown in fig .  6 are somewhat modified within factors of a few , but do not change qualitatively : they always become stronger as @xmath163 increases . the most conservative upper bound ( including negative @xmath164 cases ) turns out to be @xmath165 independently of @xmath45 . in the specific case @xmath136 ,",
    "the above bound can be lowered at least to @xmath166 .",
    "analogous limits apply to the vli parameters @xmath167 and @xmath50 . in particular , @xmath165    to our knowledge , the above limits to violations of special or general relativity principles are the strongest ever placed in the @xmath10 sector .",
    "they are valid under an assumption which is supported by the present data and appears likely to be corroborated in the future , namely , that standard @xmath2 oscillations generated by @xmath14 mass and mixing represent the dominant mechanism underlying the super - kamiokande observations .",
    "among the @xmath2 models with oscillation length following a power - law energy dependence , standard neutrino oscillations generated by @xmath14 mass and mixing are unique in providing a good description of the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data , and are strongly favored as leading mechanism for @xmath10 flavor transitions .",
    "additional , subleading @xmath2 oscillations generated by possible violations of special or general relativity in the neutrino sector do not improve the agreement with the data , and must thus have a relatively small ( or zero ) amplitude .",
    "in particular , the fractional difference of asymptotic @xmath14 velocities @xmath167 or of @xmath14 couplings to gravity @xmath168 can not exceed the value @xmath169 at 90% c.l .  for unconstrained neutrino mixing . the broadness of the neutrino energy range probed by super - kamiokande is crucial to obtain such strong limits .",
