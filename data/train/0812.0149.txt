    "more than a quarter of a millenium after the introduction by leonhard euler of the equations of incompressible fluid dynamics the question of their well - posedness in three dimensions ( 3d ) with sufficiently smooth initial data is still moot @xcite ( see also many papers in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even more vexing is the fact that switching to viscous flow for the solution of the navier  stokes equations ( nse ) barely improves the situation in 3d @xcite",
    ". finite - time blow up of the solution to the nse can thus not be ruled out , but there is no numerical evidence that this happens .",
    "in contrast , there is strong numerical evidence that for analytic spatially periodic initial data both the 3d euler and nse have complex space singularities . indeed , when such equations are solved by ( pseudo-)spectral techniques the fourier transforms of the solution display an exponential decrease at high wavenumbers , which is a signature of complex singularities @xcite .",
    "this behavior was already conjectured by von neumann @xcite who pointed out on p.  461",
    "that the solution should be analytic with an exponentially decreasing spectrum .",
    "recently li and sinai used a renormalization group method to prove that for certain complex - valued initial data the 3d nse display finite - time blow up in the real domain ( and , as a trivial corollary , also in the complex domain ) @xcite .",
    "for some pdes in lower space dimensions explicit information about the position and type of complex singularities may be available . for example , complex singularities can sometimes be related to poles of elliptic functions in connection with the reaction diffusion equation @xcite and 2d incompressible euler equations in lagrangian coordinates @xcite .",
    "the best understood case is that of the 1d burgers equation with ordinary ( laplacian ) dissipation : . ]",
    "its singularities are poles located at the zeroes of the solutions of the heat equation to which it can be mapped by using the hopf  cole transformation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we now return to the 3d nse with real analytic data .",
    "it is known that blow up in the real domain can be avoided altogether by modifying the dissipative operator , whose fourier - space symbol is @xmath6 , to a higher power of the laplacian with symbol @xmath7 .",
    "here we shall show that solutions of the cauchy problem are entire for a fairly large class of pseudo - differential nonlinear equations , encompassing variants of the 3d nse , which possess `` exponential dissipation '' , that is dissipation with a symbol growing exponentially as @xmath0 with the ratio of the wavenumber @xmath1 to a reference wavenumber @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : entire ] we consider the forced 3d incompressible nse in a periodic domain with exponential dissipation .",
    "the initial conditions are assumed just to have finite energy .",
    "the main theorem is established using classes of analytic functions whose norms contain exponentially growing weights in the fourier space @xcite . in section  [",
    "s : decay ] we show that the fourier transform of the solution decays at high wavenumbers faster than @xmath9 for any @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the nondimensionalised wavenumber . in section  [ s : extensions ] we briefly present extensions of the result to other instances : different space dimensions and dissipation rates , problems formulated in the whole space and on a sphere , and different equations . in section  [ s : burgers ] we then turn to the 1d burgers equation with a dissipation growing exponentially at high wavenumbers , for which the same bounds hold as for the 3d navier  stokes case .",
    "however in the burgers case , simple heuristic considerations ( section  [ ss : heuristics ] ) and very accurate numerical simulations performed by two different techniques ( sections  [ ss : simulation1 ] and [ ss : simulation2 ] ) , indicate that the leading - order asymptotic decay is precisely @xmath12 .",
    "we observe that the heuristic approach , which involves a dominant balance argument applied in spatial fourier space , is also applicable to the 3d navier ",
    "stokes case with exactly the same prediction regarding the asymptotic decay . in the concluding section  [ s : conclusion ]",

    "as usual the problem is rewritten as an abstract ordinary differential equation in a suitable function space , namely @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a suitable quadratic form which takes into account the nonlinear term , the pressure term and the incompressibility constraint ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we also found strong numerical evidence for analyticity .",
    "it is of interest to point out that , although analyticity is a stronger regularity than gevrey when @xmath223 , the gevrey result implies a decay of the form @xmath279 , independently of the viscosity coefficient @xmath18 , whereas analyticity in a finite strip gives a decay of the form @xmath280 where @xmath281 depends on @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "here we begin our numerical tests on the 1d burgers equation .",
    "so far we have a significant gap in the value of the constant @xmath146 appearing in the @xmath282 estimate of fourier coefficient , between the bounds and a heuristic derivation of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "in this section we shall exclusively consider the case of the unforced burgers equation with initial condition @xmath283 and dissipation with a rate @xmath284 .",
    "( thus , @xmath285 and @xmath286 . )",
    "the numerical method is however very easily extended to other functional forms of the dissipation and other initial conditions .",
    "the spectral method is actually quite versatile .",
    "its main drawback will be discussed at the end of this section .",
    "the standard way of obtaining a high - orders scheme when numerically integrating pde s with ( spatial ) periodic boundary conditions is by the ( pseudo)-spectral technique with the 2/3 rule of alias removal @xcite .",
    "the usual reason this is more precise than finite differences is that the truncation errors resulting from the use of a finite number @xmath287 of collocation points ( and thus a finite number @xmath288 of fourier modes ) decreases exponentially with @xmath287 if the solution is analytic in a strip of width @xmath158 around the real axis .",
    "indeed this implies a bound for the fourier coefficients at high @xmath1 of the form @xmath289 for any @xmath290 . in the present case ,",
    "the solution being entire , the bound is even better .",
    "there are of course sources of error other than spatial fourier truncation , namely rounding errors and temporal discretization errors .",
    "temporal discretization is a non - trivial problem here because the dissipation grows exponentially with @xmath1 and thus the characteristic time scale of high-@xmath1 modes can become exceedingly small . fortunately , these modes are basically slaved to the input stemming from nonlinear interaction of lower - lying modes .",
    "it is possible to take advantage of this to use a slaving technique which bypasses the stiffness of the equation ( a simple instance of this phenomenon is described in appendix  b of @xcite ) .",
    "we use here the slaved scheme _",
    "exponential time difference runge kutta 4 _",
    "( etdrk4 ) of @xcite with a time step of @xmath291 . without affecting the results . ]    as to the rounding noise , it is essential to use at least double precision since otherwise the faster - than - exponential decrease of the fourier coefficients would be swamped by rounding noise beyond a rather modest wavenumber .",
    "even with double precision , rounding noise problems start around wavenumber 17 , as we shall see .",
    "hence it makes no sense to use more than , say , 64 collocation points , as we have done .",
    "[ f : stupid - discrepancy - spectral ] shows the discrepancy @xmath292 which , according to heuristic asymptotic theory - , should converge to @xmath105 as @xmath293 .",
    "it is seen that the discrepancy falls to about 3.5% of the nominal value @xmath179 before getting swamped by rounding noise around wavenumber 17 .",
    "it is actually possible to significantly decrease the discrepancy by using a better processing of the numerical output , called _",
    "asymptotic extrapolation _",
    ", developed recently by van der hoeven @xcite and which is related to the theory of transseries @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to perform on the data a sequence of transformations which successively strip off the leading and subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion ( here for large @xmath1 ) .",
    "eventually , the transformed data allow a very simple interpolation ( mostly by a constant ) . the procedure can be carried out until the transformed data become swamped by rounding noise or display lack of asymptoticity , whichever occurs first .",
    "after the interpolation stage , the successive transformations are undone .",
    "this determines the asymptotic expansion of the data up to a certain order of subdominant terms .",
    "an elementary introduction to this method may be found in @xcite , from which we shall also borrow the notation for the various transformations : * i * for `` inverse '' , * r * for `` ratio '' , * sr * for `` second ratio '' , * d * for `` difference '' and * log * for `` logarithm '' .",
    "the choice of the successive transformations is dictated by various tests which roughly allow to find into which broad asymptotic class the data and their transformed versions fall .    in the present case ,",
    "the appropriate sequence of transformations is : * log * , * d * , * d * , * i * , * d*. because of the relatively low precision of the data it is not possible to perform more than five transformations , so that the method gives us access only to the leading - order asymptotic behavior , namely @xmath294 .",
    "it may be shown that the constant @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the constant value of the high-@xmath1 interpolation @xmath297 after the 5th stage of transformation .",
    "[ f : joris - discrepancy - spectral ] shows the discrepancy @xmath298 .",
    "the absolute value of the discrepancy lingers around 0.002 to 0.005 before being swamped by rounding noise at wavenumber 17 .",
    "thus with asymptotic extrapolation the discrepancy does not exceed 0.7% of the nominal value @xmath299 .",
    "the accuracy of the determination has thus improved by about a factor 5 , compared to the naive method without asymptotic extrapolation .",
    "to improve further on this result and get some indication as to the type of subdominant corrections present in the large - wavenumber expansion of the fourier coefficients it would not suffice to increase the spatial resolution , since rounding noise would still swamp the signal beyond a wavenumber of roughly 17 .",
    "higher precision spectral calculations are doable but not very simple because high - precision fast fourier transform packages are still in the experimental phase .    in the next section",
    "we shall present an alternative method , significantly less versatile as to the choice of the initial condition because it exploits the algebraic structure of a certain special class of solutions , but which also allows to work easily in arbitrary precision and thus to make better use of asymptotic extrapolation for determining the constant @xmath5 .",
    "so far we have limited ourselves to initial conditions that are real entire functions . hence the fourier coefficients had hermitian symmetry : @xmath300 , where the star denotes complex conjugation .",
    "with complex initial data there are no analytical results when the dissipation is exponential , even when the initial conditions are entire because the energy conservation relation  now about a complex - valued quantity  ceases to give @xmath23-type bounds .",
    "actually , as already pointed out , li and sinai @xcite showed that the 3d nse can display finite - time blow up with suitable complex initial data .",
    "it is however straightforward to adapt to complex solutions the heuristic argument of section  [ ss : heuristics ] and to predict a high - wavenumber leading - order term exactly of the same form as for real solutions .",
    "this is of interest since we shall see that there is a class of periodic complex initial conditions for which , provided the burgers equation is written in terms as the fourier coefficients as in @xcite and @xcite , any given fourier coefficient can be calculated at arbitrary times @xmath191 with a finite number of operations , most easily performed on a computer , by using either symbolic manipulations or arbitrary - high precision floating point calculations .    for the case of the burgers equation , this class consists of initial conditions having the fourier coefficients supported in the half line @xmath251 . is non - vanishing a simple galilean transformation can be used to make it vanish . ]",
    "we shall refer to this class of initial data as `` half - space ( fourier ) supported '' .",
    "because of the convolution structure of the nonlinearity when written in terms of fourier coefficients , it is obvious that with an initial condition supported in the @xmath251 half line , the solution will also be supported in this half line .",
    "a similar idea has been used in three dimensions for studying the singularities for complex solutions of the 3d euler equations @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider again the 1d burgers equation - with @xmath301-periodic boundary conditions for @xmath302 , rewritten as , in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath145 , assumed here to exist .",
    "the @xmath267-dependent real , even , non - negative dissipation coefficient @xmath303 is denoted by @xmath304 .",
    "the initial conditions @xmath305 ( @xmath306 ) are chosen arbitrarily , real or complex .",
    "we then have the following proposition , which is of purely algebraic nature :    * proposition  5.1 * _ eq .",
    "with the initial conditions @xmath307 ( @xmath308 ) and @xmath309 ( @xmath306 ) defines , for all @xmath251 and @xmath33 , @xmath310 as a polynomial functions of the set of @xmath311 with @xmath312 . _    _ proof _ from , after integration of the dissipative term , we obtain , for @xmath251 and @xmath33 @xmath313 observe that @xmath145 , given by , involves @xmath314 ( linearly ) and the set of fourier coefficients @xmath315 for @xmath316 and @xmath317 ( quadratically ) .",
    "the proof follows by recursive use of this property for @xmath267 , @xmath318 ,  , @xmath319 .",
    "note that the solution can be obtained without any truncation error on a computer , using symbolic manipulation .",
    "alternatively it can be calculated in arbitrary high - precision floating point arithmetic .",
    "now we specialize the initial condition even further , by assuming that the only fourier harmonic present in the initial condition has @xmath320 .",
    "we take @xmath321 for which @xmath322 , while all the other coefficients vanish .",
    "setting , for @xmath251 , @xmath323 we obtain from by working out the power series to the second order the following fully explicit expressions of the first two fourier coefficient at any time @xmath33 : @xmath324    for the one - mode initial condition with @xmath325 and @xmath326 ( exponential dissipation with @xmath285 and ( @xmath286 ) , we have calculated the fourier coefficients @xmath327 for @xmath328 using maple symbolic calculation with a forty - digit accuracy .",
    "the data have then been processed using asymptotic extrapolation as in section  [ ss : simulation1 ] with the same five transformations * log * , * d * , * d * , * i * , * d*.  fig .  [",
    "f : joris - discrepancy - sinai ] shows the discrepancy @xmath329 between the 5th stage of interpolation and the prediction from the dominant balance argument .",
    "it is seen that the discrepancy drops to @xmath330 .",
    "thus the relative error is about @xmath331 .",
    "the oscillations in the discrepancy , if they continue to higher wavenumbers would indicate that the first subdominant correction to the asymptotic behavior of the fourier coefficient @xmath332 is a prefactor involving a complex power of the wavenumber .    .",
    "note the decaying oscillatory behavior . ]    finally , we address the issue of what kind of solution we have constructed by this fourier - based algebraic method .",
    "is it a `` classical '' sufficiently smooth global - in - time solution of the burgers equations - written in the physical space ?",
    "we have here obtained strong numerical evidence that the fourier coefficients decrease faster than exponentially with the wavenumber and thus define a classical solution which is an entire function of the space variable .",
    "this is however just a conjecture .",
    "the tools used in section  [ s : entire ] to prove the entire character of the solution rely heavily on the definite positive character of the energy , a property lost with complex solutions .",
    "in this paper we have proved that for a large class of evolution pde s , including the 3d nse , exponential or faster - growing dissipation implies that the solution becomes and remains an entire function in the space variables at all times .",
    "exponential growth constitutes a threshold : subexponential growth with a fourier symbol @xmath333 , where @xmath221 makes the solution analytic ( but not entire ) as is the case in 2d ( and generally conjectured in 3d ) . furthermore , for the 3d nse and the 1d burgers equation with a dissipation having the fourier symbol @xmath334 , we have shown that the amplitude of the fourier coefficients is bounded by @xmath335 ( where @xmath336 ) for any @xmath337 .",
    "for the case of the 1d burgers equation we have good evidence that this can be improved to @xmath338 since the high-@xmath1 asymptotics seems to have a leading term precisely of the form @xmath339 ; the evidence comes both from a heuristic dominant balance argument and from high - precision simulations .",
    "the heuristic argument can actually be carried over somewhat loosely to the expnse in any dimension : again the dominant nonlinear interaction contributing to wave vector @xmath267 comes from the wave vectors @xmath340 ; actually the condition of incompressibility kills nonlinear interactions between exactly parallel wave vectors but this is only expected to modify algebraic prefactors in front of the exponential term .",
    "we thus conjecture that the @xmath341 also holds for expnse in any space dimension @xmath342 .",
    "of course there is a substantial gap between the bound and the conjectured asymptotic behavior .",
    "it seems that such a gap is hard to avoid when using @xmath23-type norms . for proving the entire character of the solution",
    "such norms were appropriate . beyond this , it is appears more advisable to try bounding directly the moduli of fourier coefficients by using the power series method @xcite .",
    "a first step in this direction would be to prove that @xmath341 for initial conditions whose fourier coefficients are compactly supported in a product of half - spaces , of the kind considered in section  [ ss : simulation2 ] .",
    "exponential dissipation differs from ordinary dissipation ( with a laplacian or a power thereof ) not only by giving a faster decay of the fourier coefficients but by doing so in a _",
    "universal _ way : with ordinary dissipation the decay of the fourier coefficient is generally conjectured to be , to leading order , of the form @xmath343 where @xmath344 depends on the viscosity @xmath345 and on the energy input or on the size of the initial velocity ; with exponential dissipation the decay is @xmath346 where @xmath347 and thus depends neither on the coefficient @xmath18 which plays the role of the viscosity nor on the initial data . predicts a constant @xmath348 . ] as a consequence , it is expected that exponential dissipation will not exhibit the phenomenon of dissipation - range intermittency , which for the usual dissipation can be traced back either to the fluctuations of @xmath344 @xcite or to complex singularities of a velocity field that is analytic but not entire @xcite .",
    "finally some comments on the practical relevance of modified dissipation .",
    "first , let us comment on `` hyperviscosity '' , the replacement of the ( negative ) laplacian by its power of order @xmath229 .",
    "of course we know that specialists of pde s have traditionally been interested in the hyperviscous 3d nse , perhaps to overcome the frustration of not being able to prove much about the ordinary 3d nse .",
    "but scientists doing numerical simulations of the nse , say , for engineering , astrophysical or geophysical applications , have also been using hyperviscosity because it is often believed to allow effectively higher reynolds numbers without the need to increase spatial resolution .",
    "recently , three of us ( uf , wp , ssr ) and other coauthors have shown that when using a high power @xmath349 of the laplacian in the dissipative term for 3d nse or 1d burgers , one comes very close to a galerkin truncation of euler or inviscid burgers , respectively @xcite .",
    "this produces a range of nearly thermalized modes which shows up in large - reynolds number spectral simulations as a huge bottleneck in the fourier amplitudes between the inertial range and the far dissipation range .",
    "since the bottleneck generates a fairly large eddy viscosity , the hyperviscosity procedure with large @xmath349 actually _ decreases _ the effective reynolds number .",
    "next , consider exponential dissipation . in 1996",
    "achim wirth noticed that when used in the 1d burgers equation , cosh dissipation produces almost no bottleneck although it grows much faster than a power of the wavenumber at high wavenumbers @xcite .",
    "it is now clear that such a dissipation will produce a faster - than - exponential decay at the highest wavenumbers .",
    "but at wavenumbers such that @xmath350 a dissipation rate @xmath351 reduces to @xmath352 , to leading order , which is the ordinary ( laplacian ) dissipation . with the ordinary 1d burgers equation",
    "it may be shown analytically that there is no bottleneck .",
    "for the ordinary 3d nse , experimental and numerical results show the presence of a rather modest bottleneck ( for example the `` compensated '' three - dimensional energy spectrum @xmath353 overshoots by about 20% . ) .",
    "if in a simulation with cosh dissipation @xmath18 and @xmath8 are adjusted in such a way that dissipation starts acting at wavenumbers slighter smaller than @xmath8 , the beginning of the dissipation range will be mostly as with an ordinary laplacian , that is with no or little bottleneck .",
    "and @xmath8 are not carefully chosen , effective dissipation can start well beyond @xmath8 .",
    "one may then observe the same kind of thermalization and of bottleneck than with a high power of the laplacian @xcite .",
    "] at higher wavenumbers , where the exponential growth of the dissipation rate is felt , faster than exponential decay will be observed . in principle",
    "this can be used to avoid wasting resolution without developing a serious bottleneck .",
    "faster than exponentially growing dissipation , e.g. @xmath354 , may be even better because the prediction is that the fourier coefficients will display gaussian decay . testing the advantages and drawbacks of different types of faster - than - algebraically growing dissipations for numerical simulations",
