    "<S> decoherence times of @xmath4 at room temperature have been measured @xcite , and elementary single - qubit operations were implemented , including manipulation @xcite , initialization @xcite and high - fidelity single - shot readout @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was further demonstrated that the nitrogen nuclear spin can be a functioning part of a small quantum register @xcite , or can act as a quantum memory to store and later retrieve the nv electron spin state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear spin entanglement has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . however , a deterministic long - distance coupling scheme that does not utilize prior electron entanglement has not yet been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of nuclear spins is fundamentally required in the context of quantum information processing , e.g.  to perform universal quantum computation @xcite .    in this article , we develop and analyze a mechanism to optically generate a controlled quantum gate between two distant nitrogen nuclear spins ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nv_center ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the nuclear spins is achieved by exchanging virtual cavity photons among two nv centers . </S>",

    "<S> this is justified by naturally occurring strain fields of 10 ghz and more @xcite , which split the excited state into two well - separated orbital branches .    </S>",
    "<S> hyperfine interaction in the excited state is modeled by a diagonal hyperfine tensor , which has the same form as in the ground state @xcite . however , since the electron density at the nitrogen site is larger in the excited state @xcite , the hyperfine interaction is about 20 times stronger compared to the ground state according to measurements under ambient conditions @xcite . </S>",
