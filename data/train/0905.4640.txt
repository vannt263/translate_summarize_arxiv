    "graphene , a monolayer of carbon atoms packed in a 2d honeycomb lattice , is a recently realized ambipolar gapless semiconductor that has attracted enormous interest  @xcite",
    ". electrons in graphene are described at low energies by a spin - independent massless dirac hamiltonian , which ultimately originates from the non - bravais nature of the 2d honeycomb lattice .",
    "the two inequivalent sites in the unit cell of this lattice are analogous to the two spin orientations of a spin-@xmath0 particle along the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions ( the @xmath3 axis being perpendicular to the graphene plane ) .",
    "this observation opens the way to an elegant description of electrons in graphene as particles endowed with a _",
    "degree - of - freedom  @xcite ( in addition to the regular spin and valley degrees of freedom which play a passive role here ) .",
    "this quantum degree - of - freedom has a number of very intriguing implications on the electronic properties of this material , most of which have been reviewed in refs .  .",
    "graphene offers a unique example of a new paradigm in condensed matter physics : a truly 2d non - galileian invariant electron liquid ( see for example refs .  ) .",
    "this non - galileian invariant nature of graphene is linked to non - trivial many - body renormalizations of various properties of doped graphene sheets  @xcite , such as the plasmon dispersion relation and the optical conductivity  @xcite , even at very long - wavelengths .",
    "both these properties are controlled by the linear response function of 2d mdfs to a vector potential , _",
    "i.e. _ by the current - current response function . because in the case of mdfs a vector potential couples to the pseudospin - density - fluctuation operator , this response function happens to coincide , apart from a trivial proportionality factor , with the pseudospin - pseudospin linear - response function .    in this work we present analytical results for the wavevector- and frequency - dependent longitudinal and transverse pseudospin - pseudospin response functions of _ noninteracting _",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : model ] we present the model and some basic definitions . in section  [ sect : undoped ] we present analytical results for the wavevector- and frequency - dependent longitudinal and transverse pseudospin - pseudospin response functions of a noninteracting _ undoped _ 2d mdf system . in section  [",

    "[ sect : diamagnetic_suscept ] we use the analytical results on the transverse response to calculate the orbital magnetic susceptibility of noninteracting mdfs .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect : summary ] we present a brief summary of our main results and mention their usefulness for the construction of ( i ) response functions that would take into account electron - electron interactions , and ( ii ) exchange - correlation functionals needed in applications of current - density - functional theory  @xcite to graphene sheets in the presence of inhomogeneous vector potentials . finally , two appendices report cumbersome technical details and calculations .",

    "( see footnote 33 ) , this unphysical finite response is due to the fact that rigorous gauge - invariance of the model described by @xmath22 is broken by the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the static response functions of the model system have to be corrected _ ad hoc _ in order to restore gauge invariance : the quantity @xmath70 has to be subtracted away  @xcite from the first lines in eqs .",

    "<S> a two - dimensional gas of massless dirac fermions ( mdfs ) is a very useful model to describe low - energy electrons in monolayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> because the mdf current operator is directly proportional to the ( sublattice ) pseudospin operator , the mdf current - current response function , which describes the response to a vector potential , happens to coincide with the pseudospin - pseudospin response function . in this work we present analytical results for the wavevector- and frequency - dependent longitudinal and transverse pseudospin - pseudospin response functions of noninteracting mdfs . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse response in the static limit is then used to calculate the noninteracting orbital magnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> these results are a starting point for the construction of approximate pseudospin - pseudospin response functions that would take into account electron - electron interactions ( for example at the random - phase - approximation level ) . </S>",
    "<S> they also constitute a very useful input for future applications of current - density - functional theory to graphene sheets subjected to time- and spatially - varying vector potentials . </S>"
