    "their limited processing and energy capabilities , wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) apply in an increasing number of domains , such as environmental monitoring @xcite , mobile healthcare @xcite and intelligent transportation systems @xcite . with the introduction of new paradigms , such as machine - to - machine communication and internet of things , the number of wireless nodes in wsns increases constantly , creating large - scale and dense randomly deployed networks . in such networks , the interference and",
    "the excessive traffic can significantly affect the quality of service ( qos ) and , consequently , the network lifetime .",
    "therefore , although in typical wsn scenarios the information collected by the sensors is forwarded through the network to a central control station ( sink ) for centralized handling and decision - making , recent applications in dense networks drive the need for local data exchange among the nodes . to that end , many works have been motivated to consider the use of distributed algorithms that encourage data processing on the node side . distributed estimation @xcite , distributed clustering @xcite and distributed data storage @xcite are among the applications that support local data exchange and processing to improve the network performance and the energy efficiency .",
    "hence , the design of effective schemes that enable neighboring nodes to exchange messages and apply distributed algorithms locally is becoming of considerable importance @xcite .    given the dense deployment , it is very probable that surrounding nodes overhear the transmissions of the network and are willing to assist the communication by acting as relays .",
    "this concept , known as cooperation @xcite , can provide noteworthy gains in the communication and was initially studied in small - scale networks where the relays are deployed in favorable positions ( e.g. , in between the transmitting nodes ) @xcite .",
    "however , in large - scale networks , i ) relay selection needs considerable overhead and signaling @xcite and ii ) it is hard to maintain a favorable position of the relays for every pair of the randomly deployed transmitting nodes . nevertheless ,",
    "although cooperation can not always guarantee notable performance gains in large - scale dense networks @xcite , it is possible to achieve diversity gains that increase the network reliability .",
    "besides , due to the limited human intervention for practical matters ( e.g. , replacing batteries ) , energy efficient communication becomes an essential concern in the design of large - scale networks .",
    "although cooperation can improve the energy efficiency of a wsn , there are more effective ways to extend the network lifetime , which is a key parameter of a wsn and strongly depends on the limited - capacity batteries .",
    "currently , a popular and drastic way to prolong the network operation is by harvesting energy from the environment to either power entirely the sensor nodes or extend the lifetime of the existing batteries @xcite . in this new paradigm , which is broadly known as energy harvesting ( eh ) , the most typical energy sources are solar , thermal , wind and kinetic energy .",
    "recently , wireless energy harvesting ( weh ) @xcite has emerged as an alternative approach to harvest the energy of the electromagnetic radiation ( emr ) from the network transmissions without the need of expensive hardware systems .",
    "weh can be adopted even in cases where the aforementioned energy sources are scarce or unstable due to their dependence on stochastic events like the weather conditions .",
    "this constitutes it a reasonable and straightforward method to extend the lifetime of the wireless nodes and , consequently , of the whole network .    due to the dependence of the energy conversion efficiency of the harvester on the amount of received emr @xcite , the benefits from weh are marginal for small - scale network applications , but interestingly high for large - scale dense networks . ideally , with weh",
    ", it would be possible to improve vastly the network performance by simultaneously transferring information and harvesting all the power .",
    "however , since the reuse of the whole received signal both from the energy harvester and the information receiver is not yet possible , various methods have been proposed in order to facilitate weh @xcite . in the class of these techniques ,",
    "dynamic power splitting ( dps ) @xcite has been proved to be among the most efficient approaches that facilitates simultaneous message decoding and energy harvesting . using dps , it is possible to dynamically share the received energy between the information decoder and the energy harvester , according to the channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver .    to that end ,",
    "several studies that consider large - scale networks with weh have lately appeared in the literature @xcite . in his pioneer work @xcite",
    ", huang studies the network throughput in a basic mobile ad hoc scenario , where the communication between the transmitter and the receiver is conducted through an ideal wireless channel ( i.e. , no path loss is assumed in the link ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , although some of the potential benefits of the weh technology are identified in @xcite , the results can not be generalized for cooperative communications . particularly , in cooperative scenarios ,",
    "the existence of relay nodes imply a volatile and complex environment that requires a dedicated study .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , guo and wang study the effects of weh in a direct communication scenario .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis is based on specific physical layer configurations , since the authors provide closed - form expressions for the qos metrics only for specific path loss conditions , i.e. , a particular value for the path loss exponent .",
    "however , the range of values that the path loss exponent can have in different environments stresses the need for theoretical expressions that provide general and environment - independent solutions .",
    "recently , an interesting approach has been presented in @xcite by krikidis , where the coverage of a large - scale network is studied , while the receivers employ a technique for simultaneous information and energy transfer .",
    "the author provides incentives for cooperation , highlighting the possible benefits , however the proposed model considers fixed distances between preassigned nodes .",
    "in addition , the model assumes a constant energy conversion efficiency for the harvester , although in realistic implementations the efficiency depends on the input power .",
    "in the same context , the work in @xcite studies a bidirectional scenario with nodes that harvest emr with a constant energy conversion efficiency . the authors provide important insights into the probability of data exchange in such scenarios , but there is no analysis with regard to the end - to - end network performance , which is essential for the evaluation of the proposed model .",
    "in addition , the possibility of direct communication among the randomly deployed nodes is neglected , as only cooperative operation is considered .    in this paper",
    ", we study the impact of weh using dps on the information exchange in large - scale networks .",
    "we consider two sets of sources that exchange their messages either directly or via randomly deployed relay nodes . as",
    "performance gains from cooperation are not always guaranteed in dense networks , it is interesting to investigate the potential benefits of cooperation in a weh - enabled dense network .",
    "in addition , we employ a realistic model for the weh conversion efficiency of the receivers @xcite .",
    "our contribution can be summarized in the following points :    * we analytically derive the probability of successful data exchange , while taking into account dps . * in order to demonstrate the potential energy gains of weh , we analytically estimate the network lifetime with and without weh . we assume a variable and ,",
    "thus , realistic energy conversion efficiency for the harvester to comply with state - of - the - art rectennas .",
    "* we provide theoretical expressions for a well - established end - to - end qos performance metric , namely the spatial throughput , and derive theoretically the optimal intensity that maximizes the network lifetime . *",
    "we conduct an extensive performance assessment for the two schemes ( direct and cooperative ) , which reveals intriguing trade - offs that provide useful insights for the design of wsns with weh .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section_systemmodel ] describes the system model and the communication scenarios .",
    "section [ section_pex ] presents the analysis for the probability of successful message exchange .",

    "section [ section_results ] presents the model validation and the numerical results .",
    "finally , section [ section_conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a large - scale network consisting of two sets of source nodes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and a set of ambient nodes acting as relays @xmath2 in two different communication scenarios : i ) direct , where the sets of source nodes exchange messages directly , and ii ) cooperative , where the randomly deployed relays @xmath3 assist @xmath4 and @xmath5 to the message exchange . in cases where it is convenient",
    ", a set of sources will be denoted as @xmath6 , @xmath7 while @xmath8 will denote the complementary set ( i.e. , when @xmath9 then @xmath10 and vice versa ) .",
    "the relays are assumed to be other sensor nodes or other type of devices ( e.g. , smartphones with dedicated interface for relaying ) .",
    "the different sets of sources measure different phenomena and broadcast their measurements .",
    "more specifically , each individual source node receives a local measurement , either directly or cooperatively from the nearest node of the other type ( i.e. , nearest - neighbor model @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , each node is required to be aware of the location of itself and of its neighbors , via localization schemes that act in higher network layers@xcite .",
    "all nodes are identical and assumed to be moving on the same euclidean plane .",
    "they are represented by three independent homogeneous ppps , a reasonable approach for wsns according to @xcite .",
    "the locations of the sources @xmath4 are described by the ppp @xmath11 with intensity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , denotes the location of the source @xmath15 on the plane @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , the location of the sources @xmath5 on @xmath16 are represented by the ppp @xmath17 with intensity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 denotes the location of the source @xmath21 . for the modeling of the relay nodes",
    ", there is an additional ppp @xmath22 with intensity @xmath23 , which represents the location @xmath24 , @xmath25 , of the relay @xmath26 .    for our analysis , without loss of generality , we assume that the respective receiving node in each slot is located at the origin ( slyvnyak s theorem @xcite ) .",
    "the received power @xmath27 at a node located in a distance @xmath28 from the transmitting node is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the transmission power of the nodes , @xmath31 is the path loss exponent and @xmath32 is the square of the amplitude fading coefficient ( i.e. , the power fading coefficient ) that is associated with the channel between the nodes .",
    "we also assume that the fading coefficients are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) .",
    "moreover , the amplitude fading @xmath33 is rayleigh with a scale parameter @xmath34 , hence @xmath32 is exponentially distributed with mean value @xmath35 .",
    "the channel is assumed to remain constant in one time slot ( i.e. , a time period in which a transmission takes place ) .",
    "all nodes are powered by a battery with initial energy level @xmath36 and in every time slot consume energy to communicate ( i.e. , @xmath30 power is consumed for transmission and @xmath37 for reception ) .",
    "also , they are capable of weh using a power splitter that dynamically adjusts the power ratio that is allocated to the information receiver and the energy harvester , i.e. , dps @xcite . a simplified illustration of a node is provided in fig .",
    "[ ehs ] , where the various parts of the node are shown .",
    "a node is able to recharge its battery by harvesting the emr energy from the transmissions of the sources and the relays in the network .",
    "according to dps , the splitting depends on the channel condition and it is described by the following rule :    v()=[powersplitfunction ] 1 , & if @xmath38 + , & if @xmath39    where @xmath32 is the power fading coefficient of the channel between the receiver and the nearest transmitter and @xmath40 is a parameter that defines the amount of power that is split between the energy harvester and the information receiver . later in this paper , we provide an empirical method to choose the value of the @xmath40 parameter .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that @xmath32 is known at the receiving node , but unknown to the transmitter . according to , when the channel conditions are poor ,",
    "all of the received signal is being fed to the information receiver . on the contrary ,",
    "when the channel conditions are satisfactory for the information receiver , then a fraction of the received power equal to @xmath41 $ ] is being fed to the energy harvester without deteriorating the communication performance . at this point",
    ", we should mention that the employed dps technique does not necessarily provide optimal performance in terms of harvested energy for our interference - limited system .",
    "however , it is a novel technique that considers the impact of fading and , thus , avoids compromising the communication performance .",
    "furthermore , the conversion efficiency of the radio frequency ( rf ) energy into direct current electricity is denoted by @xmath42 . as the conversion efficiency of a rectenna depends on the received power @xcite",
    ", we adopt a variable conversion efficiency @xmath42 modeled as a quadratic polynomial that captures the behavior of state - of - the - art rectennas @xcite , as in fig .",
    "[ rfdceff ] , given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 in watts is the input power or the total received power , which consists of the received signal and the interference , while @xmath45 are the coefficients of the cubic polynomial .    after taking into account dps , a message",
    "is considered to be successfully decoded at a receiver when the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) from its nearest transmitter , denoted as @xmath46 , is higher than a threshold @xmath47 ; otherwise the message is dropped @xcite .",
    "the sinr of a mobile node located at the origin at a distance @xmath28 from its nearest transmitter is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the aggregated interference caused by the transmitter s ppp , defined as @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the additive white gaussian noise power , modeled as a constant zero mean gaussian random variable ( rv ) .",
    "the time is divided into time slots of fixed duration @xmath52 , in which the transmission of one packet can take place .",
    "the time needed for the two sets of sources to exchange messages is called communication period ( cp ) .",
    "each cp consists of @xmath53 time slots , depending on the communication scheme , as we will describe in detail next .      in the dc scenario ,",
    "illustrated in fig .",
    "[ comphases]a , the cp consists of two time slots ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) of duration @xmath52 . in the first time slot , each @xmath4 source is broadcasting its message and each @xmath5 source attempts to decode the message of its nearest @xmath4 source .",
    "the rest transmissions of the @xmath4 sources are considered as interference for the @xmath5 source . however , when the circumstances allow it ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , this interference is beneficial for the network , because a part of it is harvested . in the second time slot , the system follows a similar procedure and each @xmath4 source attempts to decode a message from its nearest @xmath5 source . in the end of the cp",

    ". therefore , there are not always certain pairs in the network , as it happens with nodes @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this way",

    "however , in this scenario , there are also relays distributed on the plane that attempt to decode the messages from their nearest source nodes to assist the communication .",
    "therefore , in the following two time slots , the relays are consecutively broadcasting the messages of their nearest @xmath4 and @xmath5 node . in this way",
    ", there is a diversity gain , since the sources have two possible ways of receiving a message from a source of the other type . at the fourth time slot in fig .",
    "[ comphases]b , we notice that most source nodes have received the same message twice .",
    "this means that these nodes have higher probability to decode this message .",
    "however , depending on the random topology , there is a chance that some source nodes will receive two different messages , as it happens in nodes @xmath62 and @xmath60 and , thus , deduce more information about their environment .",
    "moreover , if a relay fails to decode the messages in the first two time slots , then it transmits power to the sources to cooperate only in terms of energy .",
    "in this section , we present the probability of successful message exchange between the two types of sources in one cp for the dc and cc scenarios .",
    "the successful message exchange probability is an important qos metric , defined as the probability of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 sources to decode successfully the received messages within a cp .      in the first time slot of the dc scenario ,",
    "all @xmath5 source nodes decode successfully a direct message from their nearest @xmath4 neighbor with a probability denoted as @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , with @xmath64 we denote the probability that all @xmath4 source nodes decode successfully a direct message from their nearest @xmath5 neighbor in the second time slot .",
    "these probabilities ( i.e. , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) are independent and have common network parameters except for the intensity @xmath12 and @xmath18 , respectively . therefore , the probability @xmath65 is a function of the intensity and the probability @xmath66 that all source nodes have successfully decoded a message from the nearest neighbor of the other type is given by @xmath67 to that end , to derive @xmath66 we have to calculate the probability @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , in order to account for the power splitting process described by , we have to differentiate between the cases of @xmath38 and @xmath55 .",

    "hence , the spatial throughput ( messages / s / unit - area ) of the network is defined as @xmath141 where @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 denote the successful exchange probability and the number of slots per scenario , respectively .    finally , another metric that can be deduced using the spatial throughput is the average total messages exchanged in a lifetime per unit area ( tme ) , which is given by multiplying the spatial throughput with the network lifetime and the number of slots per cp for each scenario .",
    "tme can be written as @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the network lifetime for the various scenarios derived in section [ section_lifetime ] . in the following section",
    ", we will present and validate the numerical results of all the metrics that have been presented so far .",
    "in this section , we validate the proposed theoretical framework via extensive simulations and provide useful insights on the use of weh by comparing the metrics of interest for the different communication scenarios .",
    "we compare the two proposed scenarios , direct and simple cooperative without eh ( dc and cc , respectively ) and with eh ( dc - eh and cc - eh , respectively ) . for high accuracy ,",
    "we create 10.000 realizations of a @xmath147 m by @xmath147 m area with intensities varying from @xmath148 to @xmath149 devices per m@xmath150 ( i.e. , the number of devices per realization is from @xmath151 up to @xmath152 ) .",
    "the time slot duration is denoted as @xmath52 and depends on the application scenario and the chosen bitrate .",
    "the transmit power is @xmath153 mw , while the power for the reception mode is @xmath154 mw @xcite and the initial level of a node s battery is @xmath155  j. additionally , the path loss exponent is chosen to be @xmath78 , although it is possible to use any value @xmath31 . for the model validation , the channel fading gain is set to @xmath156 and the noise power to @xmath157  dbm for @xmath158  khz system bandwidth for all scenarios , unless otherwise stated , while we vary the values of decoding threshold @xmath47 and intensity @xmath159 in order to present the performance of the system under different conditions .",
    "in addition , if not explicitly stated otherwise , the decoding threshold is fixed at @xmath160 db and the intensity @xmath159 of the ppps is set to @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .     and average harvested power @xmath164 versus the @xmath40-parameter . ]",
    "moreover , in all the experiments , the coefficients for the rf - to - dc conversion efficiency @xmath42 given in are @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , according to @xcite for the case of @xmath169 mhz .",
    "regarding the @xmath40-parameter in , since it defines the amount of power that is split between the harvester and the information receiver , it can be chosen in a way that increases the average harvested power without affecting the probability of successful exchange . in fig .",
    "[ final11 ] , we provide the relation of @xmath40 with the two metrics ( i.e. , probability of successful decoding and average harvested power ) .",
    "it can be observed that by sacrificing only @xmath170 in the probability of successful decoding , the average harvested power is increased by @xmath171 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the probability of exchange drops with a low rate as @xmath40 is reduced , while the average harvested power rises with a much higher rate .",
    "therefore , in our experiments , the @xmath40-parameter has been fixed at @xmath172 db or @xmath173 .      in this section ,",
    "we validate the basic metrics ( i.e. , probability of successful message exchange and average harvested power ) of our analysis , that are used for the derivations of the end - to - end qos and lifetime metrics . in fig .",
    "[ final12 ] , we plot the probability of successful message exchange for the direct and cooperative communication scenarios versus the decoding threshold @xmath47 .     for the direct and cooperative scenarios .",
    "]    as we can see , the probability @xmath66 matches perfectly with the simulations and , thus , theorem  1 is validated .",
    "furthermore , the probability @xmath66 becomes lower as the decoding threshold increases .",
    "this result can be justified by the fact that , for higher decoding thresholds , the received signal must be much stronger than the interference plus noise .",
    "similar conclusions can be derived in the result for the cooperative communication scenario .",
    "as we can see , lemma  2 is validated and the probability @xmath84 decreases for higher decoding thresholds . by comparing the two curves",
    ", we can also notice that the probability of successful exchange is higher in the cooperative communication case compared to the direct one for the same decoding thresholds .",
    "this has been already proven in small - scale networks and with our study we extend this result even for large - scale networks with random relay deployment .",
    "thus , thanks to diversity , there is a probability that the message exchange will take place via relay nodes , even if the direct communication fails .    ,",
    "( b ) @xmath156 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ final145 ] , we plot the average harvested power by a source in one cp versus the node intensity , considering two different cases for the channel conditions , a ) favorable with @xmath174 and b )  moderate with @xmath156 .",
    "one first straightforward observation from both figures is that , as the intensity increases until a certain point , the nodes harvest more power , due to the higher interference .",
    "also , compared to fig .",
    "[ final145]a , the results in fig .",
    "[ final145]b need higher intensity to achieve the same average harvested power , because the fading conditions attenuate the received power and , thus , the average harvested power .",
    "however , it is very interesting to see that , after a peak value , the average harvested power is decreasing .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ final145]a and it stems from the fact that the rf - to - dc conversion efficiency of the rectennas , given in and shown in fig",
    ".  [ rfdceff ] , decreases as the received power increases over a certain point . indeed , to highlight the difference between the average harvested power with and without rf - to - dc conversion , we also plot in the same figure the cases without the conversion , which show the significant amount of energy that is lost due to the conversion ( e.g. , for @xmath174 and @xmath175 in the dc scenario , the difference between the two cases is over 3 dbm ) .",
    "this is a very important insight which implies that i ) adding more nodes in the network does not necessarily increase the lifetime of the network and ii ) there is a unique maximum of the average harvested power according to the conditions of the system .",
    "in addition , by comparing the different communication scenarios in both figures , we notice that the cooperative scenario provides the highest amount of harvested power .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in this scenario , there are also relays that provide more energy to the system in one cp .        in fig .",
    "[ al ] , we present the average network lifetime with and without eh for both scenarios versus the intensity @xmath12 of the @xmath4 source nodes . for the dc scenario ( fig .",
    "[ al]a ) , we assume that the intensity @xmath18 is equal to the optimal intensity calculated using lemma [ loptlemma ] ( i.e. , @xmath176 for @xmath174 and @xmath177 for @xmath156 ) .",
    "similarly , for the cc scenario ( fig .",
    "[ al]b ) , we assume that the intensity of the relays is equal to the optimal ( @xmath163 ) and we set @xmath178 . as expected , eh increases the lifetime of the network , especially for the cooperative scenario , where the lifetime gains can reach up to @xmath179% , compared to a gain of @xmath180 in fig .",
    "the gains are higher for the cc scenario , because relays contribute to the average harvested energy during each cp compared to the dc scenario .",
    "additionally , it can be noticed that , in the cc case , there is a limit in the average lifetime from the intensities between @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "this stems from the fact that @xmath5 sources can not achieve higher lifetime than this limit ( i.e. , @xmath178 ) , which limits the lifetime of the whole network , as it is explained in remark [ minrem ] .",
    "having validated the analysis , we now present a performance evaluation for the two communication scenarios in fig .",
    "[ tmef ] . in this figure",
    ", the simulation results appear as markers while the lines represent the analytical results . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ tmef]a , the spatial throughput increases with the intensity , since more nodes exchange messages per unit area .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to notice that , although the probability of message exchange is always higher in the cooperative communication ( see also remark [ remdccc ] ) , the spatial throughput for the cooperative scenario presents lower performance than the dc scenario .",
    "this can be justified by considering the randomness in the deployment of the relays and the longer cps in the cooperative scenario . to clarify , although the performance gains from cooperation are obvious in a scenario where the relays are located in between the source nodes , this is not the case for randomly deployed networks . in such networks , it is possible for a direct link to provide better communication than a cooperative link , whereas the performance of the cooperative scenario is limited and depends on the random relay deployment . this fact in conjunction with the longer cps in the cooperative scenario are the reasons that the message exchange rate of cc drops in comparison to the dc scenario .    moreover , in fig .",
    "[ tmef]b , we combine the two metrics given in fig .",
    "[ al ] and fig .  [ tmef]a and",
    "estimate the number of successfully decoded messages during the network lifetime per unit area as a function of the intensity . from this figure ,",
    "it is evident that the cc - eh scenario presents lower performance compared to the direct scenario with eh , which shows that the additional time slots in the cc scenario drop the performance .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ tmef]b , it is worth noting that the performance of the network through time is not taken into account .",
    "since the battery capacity of the cc scenario is decreased through time with a lower rate than in the dc scenario , we could identify the trade - offs between the two scenarios while taking into account the total exchanged messages and the average lifetime .        finally , in fig .",
    "[ mpt ] , we present the average exchanged messages per unit area versus time for two different intensity combinations ( i.e. , in fig .",
    "[ mpt]a , @xmath183 and @xmath184 and in fig .",
    "[ mpt]b , @xmath185 ) .",
    "we observe that , in fig .",
    "[ mpt]a , the network has lower lifetime compared to fig .",
    "[ mpt]b , because the network lifetime is limited by the lower intensity of the @xmath5 set of source nodes . on the other hand , when all sets have the optimal intensity ( fig .",
    "[ mpt]b ) , the network lifetime is maximized .",
    "moreover , it can be clearly seen that the communication scenarios present different trade - offs .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ mpt]a , the dc scenario has higher number of exchanged messages but lower lifetime , while the cc scenario demonstrates higher lifetime ( @xmath186% ) with fewer exchanged messages ( @xmath187% ) .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "[ mpt]b , the cc scenario demonstrates higher lifetime ( @xmath188% ) with again fewer exchanged messages ( @xmath187% ) .    to that end ,",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ tmef ] and fig .",
    "[ mpt ] reveal the counter - intuitive insight that the dc scenario presents better communication performance than the cc scenario in randomly deployed dense networks .",
    "nevertheless , thanks to its higher lifetime , the cc scenario could be proved ideal for applications such as in cases where the nodes are embedded in buildings or bodies without easy access , where longevity is more important than high data rates .",
    "this paper has studied the impact of weh on the information exchange in large - scale networks .",
    "the purpose of the randomly deployed wsn nodes is to exchange successfully their messages locally with their neighbors , either directly ( direct communication scenario ) or through a relay node ( cooperative communication scenario ) .",
    "the different scenarios were compared in terms of message exchange probability , spatial throughput and network lifetime .",
    "the theoretical derivations were validated by extensive monte - carlo simulations .",
    "finally , the comparison of the two scenarios highlighted the importance of weh in large - scale networks and revealed that the direct communication scenario presents better communication performance than the cooperative scenario in randomly deployed dense networks .",
    "however , the cooperative scenario is more advisable in applications where longevity matters , since it is superior in terms of lifetime .",

    "as we have stated in the system model , the probability of successful transmission is defined as the probability that the sinr @xmath46 measured at the nearest receiver is higher than a threshold @xmath47 .",

    "<S> as large - scale dense and often randomly deployed wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) become widespread , local information exchange between co - located sets of nodes may play a significant role in handling the excessive traffic volume . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to account for the limited life - span of the wireless devices , harvesting the energy of the network transmissions provides significant benefits to the lifetime of such networks . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the performance of communication in dense networks with wireless energy harvesting ( weh)-enabled sensor nodes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we examine two different communication scenarios ( direct and cooperative ) for data exchange and we provide theoretical expressions for the probability of successful communication . </S>",
    "<S> then , considering the importance of lifetime in wsns , we employ state - of - the - art weh techniques and realistic energy converters , quantifying the potential energy gains that can be achieved in the network . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical derivations , which are validated by extensive monte - carlo simulations , highlight the importance of weh in dense networks and identify the trade - offs between the direct and cooperative communication scenarios .    </S>",
