    "the study of resonance production plays an important role both in pp and heavy - ion high energy collisions . in pp collisions",
    ", it contributes to the general understanding of hadron production mechanisms and provides a reference for tuning qcd - inspired models .    in heavy - ion collisions , due to their short lifetime ( few fm/@xmath3 ) , resonances can decay inside the fireball , and studying the interactions of their decay products with the surrounding medium allows one to estimate its temperature and investigate its time evolution  @xcite .",
    "moreover , resonances produced in the early stages of the collision can show signals of chiral symmetry restoration in terms of modifications of their mass and/or width  @xcite .",
    "alice  @xcite is the lhc experiment mainly devoted to the study of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , in order to investigate the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "its excellent capabilities for particle identification  @xcite over a wide @xmath4 range ( from @xmath50.1 to @xmath510  @xmath6 ) , make it a very well suited device for the study of resonances .",
    "results are presented for @xmath0 ( identified by charged @xmath7 decay channel ) , @xmath1 ( k@xmath8k@xmath9 decay channel ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath10 decay channel ) measurements done with a sample of data collected by alice in 2010 . section  [ sec : analysis ] briefly describes the analysis procedure and section  [ sec : results ] shows some results .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] presents the conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the data analysis is carried out using a sample of minimum - bias pp data collected by alice during 2010 , with a size ranging from 25 to 155 million events , for the different resonances analyzed . in order to minimize the background , particle identification selection criteria for the decay products",
    "are used , which are based on their d@xmath11d@xmath12 measured by the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and their @xmath13 measured by the time of flight ( tof ) detector .    due to their very short lifetime",
    ", resonance decay products can not be distinguished from the particles coming from the primary vertex , and their yield can only be measured by computing the invariant mass spectrum of all primary tracks and then subtracting the combinatorial background . for the @xmath0 ,",
    "the combinatorial background is estimated from like - sign @xmath7 pairs and then subtracted from the unlike - sign @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting distribution is fitted with a breit - wigner function plus a straight line to account for a remaining residual background ( figure  [ fig : peaks ] left ) .",
    "the raw yields of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are extracted by fitting the invariant mass distributions with a function composed by a polynomial to describe the background , plus a voigtian , i.e. the convolution of a gaussian and a breit - wigner ( figure  [ fig : peaks ] right ) .",
    "this choice is necessary to take into account the resolution in invariant mass , since it ranges between 1 and 2  @xmath14 and is therefore comparable with the nominal widths of these resonances ( 4.25 and 9.1  @xmath14 , respectively ) .",
    "the raw yields of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in pp collisions are corrected for reconstruction efficiency , acceptance and branching ratio and then normalized to the number of inelastic collisions in the analyzed sample  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the resulting spectra , compared with phojet  @xcite and some widely used pythia  @xcite tunes : d6 t  @xcite , atlas - csc  @xcite and perugia-0  @xcite . for the @xmath0 , pythia",
    "d6 t shows the best agreement , while phojet and atlas - csc produce a softer spectrum .",
    "the @xmath1 is well reproduced by d6 t below 2.5  @xmath6 and by phojet and atlas - csc above this limit .",
    "both mesons are underestimated by perugia-0 .",
    "in contrast , all models underestimate the @xmath2 yield . figure  [ fig : ratios ] shows the @xmath15k@xmath9 and @xmath16k@xmath9 ratios , for different energies and different colliding systems  @xcite . including alice measurements  @xcite . both ratios do not vary with @xmath17 .",
    "spectral distributions @xmath18 has been determined for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances through their hadronic decay channels .",
    "spectra show different levels of agreement with various event generators : mesons are reasonably well reproduced ( except by perugia-0 ) while the @xmath2 is underestimated in all cases",
    ". ratios of @xmath1 and @xmath0 to k@xmath9 do not increase with respect to lower energies .",
    "other resonances studies are ongoing to complement the picture for pp collisions at 7 tev : @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the analysis of pb  pb collisions at @xmath22  @xmath23 has also started with the extraction of @xmath1 signal for @xmath24  @xmath6 , both in central and peripheral events .",
