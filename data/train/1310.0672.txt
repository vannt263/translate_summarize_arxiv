    "the analysis of chaotic signals and the detection of particular patterns inside them are important issues for physics and nonlinear science .",
    "the presence of special patterns such as intermittent deterministic behaviors reveal important information on a given physical system .",
    "we propose in this work a signal processing method able to detect regular behaviors occurring in chaotic signals . to demonstrate its efficiency we apply it to signals where lvy flights occur : particles display intermittent behavior with almost random motion succeeded with periods of ballistic motion .",
    "this method possesses several key properties required for the study of experimental data .",
    "it is robust , not influenced by the nature of the random fluctuations of the signal nor by a reasonable amount of noise which may be present all over the signal ( due to experimental measurements ) .",
    "secondly , it relies on the fractional fourier transform .",
    "several numerical implementations of this transform are available among the scientific community which makes the method relatively easy to use for non - expert in signal processing .",
    "in addition , this transform can be implemented using fast algorithms .",
    "the robustness of our method relies on an uncertainty principle which is reminiscent of quantum mechanics .",
    "it can be shown that one can not measure exactly both frequency and time of a given signal .",
    "we use this latter relation to our advantage . through an elementary transformation we turn random fluctuations of the signal amplitude into random fluctuations of the frequency of a new signal .",
    "when these frequencies are rapidly varying , case of random behavior or noise in the signal , the uncertainty principle makes it impossible to have precise information on these variations . in the meantime ,",
    "coherent behavior is emphasized since it is less fluctuating . as a consequence it eases the detection process and makes it more robust .",
    "this work follows the preliminary results presented in  @xcite where the use of the uncertainty principle was first stated .",
    "we focus here on the signal processing method and integrate it into the more general framework of the fractional fourier transform .    in section  [ sec : tf ]",
    "the signal processing method is presented and in section  [ aba : sec1 ] , we present an illustration of the method with its application to simulated data from a physical phenomenon : advected particles composed of random motion and lvy flights .",
    "the technique presented here is dedicated to the analysis of signals being made of two ingredients :    * parts with random fluctuations , e.g. ( fractional ) brownian motions , gaussian or other types of noises . * parts with a linear behavior with respect to the variable , often embedded with a reasonable amount of noise ( `` reasonable '' will be made precise in the following ) .",
    "this kind of intermittent signals is typically found in nonlinear physics experiments , for instance in fluid mechanics at the transitions between regular and chaotic / turbulent regimes .",
    "an illustration of such signal is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig - phase ] ( left ) .",
    "several regions can be distinguished : random fluctuation zones associated to a brownian motion and some linear regions ( of different length and slope ) corresponding to a different behavior ( lvy flights ) .",
    "note that the linear parts may contain small fluctuations .",
    "our technique is able to detect these linear parts , even embedded in noise , and to measure their length and slope .      in order to follow a rapidly varying signal the measurements must be precise both in the variable value and in the measured quantity depending on it . in some configurations ,",
    "where the uncertainty principle holds , this is not possible .",
    "this principle prevents for example the precise evaluation of the frequency of an oscillating signal when this frequency is evolving with time ( non - stationary signal ) .",
    "it is often a problem in physics but we propose here to use it to our benefit : we need to emphasize the low fluctuation components of our signals among the random variations . for that , we turn our signal into a time - frequency measurement problem .",
    "the first step of our analysis is to interpret the signal @xmath0 , a vector of @xmath1 , depending on the variable @xmath2 $ ] , as the phase derivative ( the fluctuation of the  frequency component  ) of a new signal @xmath3 depending on time @xmath4 .",
    "the oscillating signal @xmath3 is made of an single non - stationary frequency component in the following way : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is related to the signal @xmath0 by : @xmath7 in order to see the image of @xmath0 through this transformation , we compute the short - time fourier transform of @xmath3 : @xmath8 with a gaussian window @xmath9 . the modulus of this representation @xmath10 of the function @xmath3 gives the spectrogram ( see e.g.  @xcite for more details on time - frequency techniques ) .",
    "as an example , for @xmath0 given on fig .",
    "[ fig - phase ] ( right ) , @xmath11 is plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig - phase ] ( left ) .     with fluctuating regions and linear regions ( lvy flights ) .",

    "right : spectrogram of @xmath3 ( absolute value of the short - time fourier transform of @xmath3 ) .",
    "darker regions are associated to high values of @xmath11.,title=\"fig : \" ]    one can guess the signal @xmath0 from @xmath10 but important differences can be seen .",
    "first the thin line of the graph of @xmath0 is now a thick line in the time - frequency plane .",
    "secondly , regions of high fluctuations appear blurred and diffuse .",
    "indeed , the short - time fourier transform can be seen as a convolution between the modulated signal @xmath12 and a gaussian window , which has a blurring action . as a consequence random behavior",
    "is blurred even more , spread over a neighborhood zone , whereas linear parts remain relatively sharp .",
    "we now turn to the method able to detect and quantify these time - frequency patterns .      for the detection of linear behavior in chaotic signals ,",
    "we need a method able to detect these straight line patterns . in a 2 dimensional image",
    ", one would use techniques such as the hough transform . in our case , we need a similar tool retrieving straight lines which would appear when a time - frequency decomposition is done ( such as the short - time fourier transform , the gabor transform , or the wigner - ville transform ) . the appropriate tool for this purpose is based on the fractional fourier transform .",
    "let us first introduce it .",
    "there are two definitions in the discrete setting ( where signals are sampled and of finite length )  @xcite , which are not equivalent .",
    "the first one involves hermite functions and the second one relies on the discretization of the integral .",
    "we choose the second definition as it is computationally faster than the first one , since it can be done with a fast fourier transform .",
    "the discrete fractional fourier transform @xmath13 of a signal @xmath14 of length @xmath15 is defined as ( see  @xcite ) : @xmath16 } f(t ) , \\label{projection32}\\ ] ] where @xmath17}}{\\sqrt{|\\sin\\theta|}},\\ ] ] the angle @xmath18 parametrizes the transform such that : for @xmath19 we obtain the signal in time ( no transform ) and for @xmath20 we obtain the standard fourier transform of @xmath14 .",
    "the variable @xmath21 is the time for @xmath19 , the frequency for @xmath20 and is a generalized variable for other values of the @xmath18 . since @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 with @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "a connection can be made with the previous study  @xcite in the following way .",
    "up to a phase factor @xmath25 and a normalization constant @xmath26 , the frft is the projection of the signal @xmath14 on a basis of chirp signals : @xmath27}.\\ ] ] notice that applying the frft is not strictly equivalent to the calculation done in  @xcite .",
    "the additional phase factor has no importance since only the magnitude of the transform is used to detect the presence of lvy flights .",
    "however , the normalization factor @xmath28 which depends on the angle is important when comparing projections at different angles .",
    "hence the present version ( which includes it ) is more natural and accurate .",
    "also , one has to change @xmath21 into @xmath29 .    as pointed out in  @xcite and discussed in  @xcite , numerical instabilities",
    "may arise when calculating the fractional fourier transform for small values of @xmath18 .",
    "this correspond to the detection process of lvy flights with steep slopes . to cope with this problem , the property @xmath30",
    "is used : for @xmath31 $ ] or @xmath32 $ ] the frft is directly computed and for @xmath33 $ ] a first fourier transform is made followed by a frft of angle @xmath34 .",
    "this preliminary fourier transform is equivalent to making a 90 degrees rotation of the time - frequency plane . as a consequence , chirps ( lvy flights in the frequency - time plane ) with large slope",
    "get rotated i.e. their slope coefficient gets inverted .",
    "the frft is suited for the detection of chirp as @xmath35 will increase whenever a chirp of slope @xmath36 is present . hence searching for linear patterns in the time - frequency plane",
    "is reduced to looking for peaks of the frft in the @xmath37 space .",
    "suppose a peak is present at @xmath38 , then the slope @xmath0 of the linear part can be deduced from @xmath39 , its shift @xmath40 from the frequency origin with @xmath41 and its length @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath43 : @xmath44    the frft can be reversed and it is possible to detect a linear part with slope @xmath45 inside the signal then erase it in the @xmath37 space and to re - synthesize the signal without this linear part by applying a frft of angle @xmath46 .    in order to detect the different slopes of the lvy flights",
    "it is necessary to apply the frft for different @xmath18 regularly spaced .",
    "the number of selected @xmath18 is fixed by the user depending on how accurate he wants to be and is independent of the length of the signal @xmath15 .",
    "the fast implementation of the frft is of complexity @xmath47 , hence the overall complexity is of the same order .      on the signal shown in fig .",

    "in this section we briefly discuss the phenomenon of stickiness that occurs in low - dimensional hamiltonian systems .",
    "stickiness occurs in the vicinity of some islands of regular motion , inducing memory effects and lvy flights . in order to be more explicit",
    "we shall consider a specific example where this occurs , namely the phenomenon of chaotic advection of passive tracers . in order to generate a specific flow we shall consider the one generated by three vortices",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) .      for chaotic advection",
    "we consider a flow @xmath71 of an incompressible fluid ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the notion of a passive particle corresponds to an idealized particle which presence in the fluid has no impact on the flow .",
    "this is usually not true , but if the particle is small enough this can be a good approximation .",
    "the particle is then just transported by the fluid and its motion is given by the equation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 corresponds to the passive particle position , and the @xmath75 to a time derivative .",
    "for a two - dimensional flow , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gene_advec ] ) corresponds actually to hamiltonian equation of motion .",
    "since the flow is incompressible , we can define a stream function which resumes to a scalar field , meaning that @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the unit vector perpendicular to the considered two dimensional flow .",
    "the equations governing the motion of a passive tracer eq .",
    "( [ eq : gene_advec ] ) become @xmath78 where the space coordinates @xmath79 correspond to the canonical conjugate variables of the hamiltonian @xmath80 .    when @xmath80 is time",
    "independent , the system is integrable , and particles follow stream lines .",
    "when the stream function @xmath80 becomes time - dependent , we end up with a hamiltonian system with @xmath81 degrees of freedom .",
    "these systems generically exhibit hamiltonian chaos .",
    "this phenomenon was dubbed chaotic advection @xcite . as a consequence chaotic advection can enhance drastically the mixing properties of the flow , in the sense that mixing induced by chaotic motion",
    "is much more rapid than the one occurring naturally through molecular diffusion .",
    "this is even more important when the flow is laminar @xcite .",
    "when dealing with mixing in micro - fluid experiments and devices chaotic advection becomes crucial .",
    "indeed since the reynolds number are usually small , chaotic mixing becomes , de facto , an efficient way to mix .",
    "there are also numerous domains of physics , displaying chaotic advection - like phenomena , for instance in geophysical flows or magnetized fusion plasmas @xcite .    in order to test the lvy detection protocol we established",
    ", we will consider data originating from passive particles which have been advected by a two - dimensional flow generated by three point vortices .",
    "we shall thus briefly recall the notion of a point vortex .      as mentioned before moving on to advection , let us discuss briefly the flow generated by point vortices . for this purpose",
    "we start with the equation governing the vorticity of a perfect two - dimensional incompressible flow ( the euler equation ) : @xmath82 where @xmath83 corresponds to the poisson brackets . to get the point vortex dynamics we consider a vorticity field given by a superposition of dirac functions : @xmath84 where",
    ", @xmath85 designates the strength ( vorticity ) of a point vortex located in the two - dimensional plane on the point @xmath86 .",
    "one then finds that this singular distribution becomes an exact solution ( in the weak sense ) of the equation  ( [ vorticity15 ] ) when the the @xmath15 point vortices have a prescribed motion@xcite . to be more specific the dynamics has to reflect the one originating from @xmath15-body hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "and when considering no boundary condition , meaning allowing the flow to live on the infinite plane , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and are thus strongly related to the actual vortex position @xmath86 in the plane .",
    "when actually computing the equation of motion originating from the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) , ( and this how they actually make sense and were computed ) we can notice that each vortex is moving according to the velocity generated by the other vortices but himself .",
    "having the evolution of the positions of the point vortices we have as well access to the stream function ( the hamiltonian governing passive tracers ) @xmath89 finally we would like to point out that the hamiltonian of the vortices ( [ hamilton ] ) is invariant by translation and by rotation . as a consequence of these symmetries and the associated conserved quantities ,",
    "the motion of point vortices becomes chaotic when @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "so in order to address chaotic advection , we would like to consider a regular ( laminar ) time - dependent flow and we therefore settled for a flow generated by three vortices .",
    "the motion of three point vortices even though integrable shows a larges variety of behaviors , quasi - periodic and aperiodic flows are both possible , however in order to address transport properties , we are interested in the asymptotic ( large times ) behavior ; in order to achieve this we considered a quasi - periodic motion vortices .",
    "work related to transport for the case of three identical vortices can be found in @xcite and the work with vortices with different signs from which the data analyzed in this paper was considered , is reported in @xcite .",
    "we have discussed chaotic mixing in a flow generated by three point vortices . in these systems",
    ", transport can be anomalous . to be more precise",
    ", the type of transport is defined by the value of the characteristic exponent of the evolution of the second moment .    in summary",
    ", transport is said to be anomalous if it is not diffusive in the sense that @xmath91 , with @xmath92 :    1 .",

    "if @xmath94 transport is gaussian and we have diffusion .",
    "if @xmath95 transport is anomalous and we have super - diffusion .    when considering system of three point vortices , as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ poicarresectionk01 ] , one notices that the chaotic sea is finite . since the chaotic region is bounded , inferring anomalous properties is not easy when considering the particle s position , it is easier to work instead with length of trajectories and measure the the dispersion among different trajectories associated to this quantity @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the speed of particle @xmath63 at time @xmath98 .",
    "then to characterize and study transport we compute the moments @xmath99 where @xmath100 corresponds to ensemble averaging over different trajectories . in order to characterize the transport properties we compute the evolution of the different moments , from which we extract a characteristic exponent , @xmath101        transport properties are found to be super - diffusive and multi - fractal @xcite , and",
    "this is the results of the memory effects engendered by stickiness : in the vicinity of an island , trajectories can stay for for arbitrary large times mimicking the regular trajectories nearby , these islands act then as pseudo - traps .",
    "this stickiness generates a slow decay of correlations ( memory effects ) , which results in anomalous super - diffusive transport .    to illustrate the phenomenon the poincar section of passive tracers motion and the sticking regions",
    "are represented in fig .",
    "[ poicarresectionk01 ] , ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "once a trajectory sticks around an island , its length grows almost linearly with time , with an average speed around the island generically different from the average speed over the chaotic sea .",
    "this implies the presence of of lvy flights in the data corresponding to trajectories lengths . in fig .",
    "[ poicarresectionk01 ] , four sticking regions have been identified , these regions are naturally expected to give rise to four different typical average speeds , one therefore expect to identify four different types of lvy flights in the advected data .",
    "we now consider blindly data obtained from the advection of 250 tracers in the point vector flow described in the previous subsection .",
    "that is to say , we analyze with our method 250 signals dislaying similar properties as the one presented in section  [ sec : tf ] .",
    "we set up a threshold on the modulus of the projection coefficients ( ) , in order to select only the most relevant lvy flights .",
    "similar transport data was was analyzed in @xcite , with traditional tools and found to be anomalous and super diffusive .",
    "as mentionned , the starting point of the anomaly was traced back to a multi fractal nature of transport linked to stickiness on four different regular regions .",
    "one would thus expect four different type of lvy flights in the data ( see fig .  [ poicarresectionk01 ] ) .    in the present case , the method described in part  [ sec : tf ]",
    "has been applied to the data set .",
    "our goal is to detect the multi - fractal nature of the transport resulting from the sticky islands , which would serve as a proof of concept and pave the way to apply the method to numerical and experimental data .",

    "[ velocity ] ( right ) .",

    "[ poicarresectionk01 ] , so that each specific detected flight can be easlily associated to its originating sticky region .",

    "the second part of the signal processing technique belongs to the framework of sparsity based analyses .",
