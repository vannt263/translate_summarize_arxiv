    "quantum control of tunneling processes of single particles plays a major role in different areas of physics and chemistry @xcite ranging from shapiro steps in josephson junctions @xcite to the control of chemical reactions via light in molecules @xcite .",
    "as early as 1986 , dunlap and kenkre studied theoretically the quantum motion of a charged particle on a discrete lattice driven by an ac field @xcite , and found the surprising result that particle transport can be completely suppressed when ratio of the strength and the frequency of the ac field takes some special values .",
    "this effect of dynamical localization ( dl ) was later found to be associated with the coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) @xcite at a collapse point of the floquet quasienergy spectrum @xcite , and has also been observed in different systems @xcite .",
    "there has been growing interest in the quantum control of electrons in semiconductor superlattices or arrays of coupled quantum dots from both theoretical and experimental sides @xcite .",
    "most of the dl and cdt of the electronic systems are generic and also can occur in atomic @xcite and optical @xcite systems .",
    "recently , different routes to cdt were found by considering , respectively , the priori prescribed number of bosons of a many - boson system @xcite , the distinguishable intersite separations of a bipartite lattice @xcite , the variable driving symmetry of a two - frequency driven particle in a double - well @xcite , and the different combined modulations to a two - level system @xcite .",
    "the cdt mechanism has been applied to different physical fields such as the quantum transition in ultracold atomic systems @xcite , the directed transport in a bipartite lattice @xcite , and the design of quantum tunneling switch based on a planar four - well @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the cdt mechanism can also be applied to coherently control instability of a periodically driven system @xcite .",
    "stability of a quantum state has been recognized long ago during the heyday of quantum mechanics . in the sense of lyapunov , by the instability of a solution we mean that the initially small deviations from the given solution grow without upper limit that could lead to destruction of the solution behavior .",
    "therefore , investigation on the stability is important for the practical application .",
    "the instability of the periodically driven lattice systems has been investigated @xcite .",
    "it is found that stability of the systems depends on signs of the effective tunneling rates of two nearest - neighbor barriers such that one can stabilizes the systems by tuning the effective tunneling rates . here",
    "our aim is finding a new route of cdt and supplying a simple stabilization method for transporting single particles in a driven bipartite lattice .",
    "the coherent control of an ac driven particle in a lattice with a single intersite separation has been investigated widely in the nearest - neighbor tight binding ( nntb ) approximation @xcite .",
    "more recently , a bipartite lattice or double - well train with two different intersite separations @xcite is applied to induce the ratchetlike effect @xcite , to transport quantum information @xcite and to realize two - qubit quantum gates @xcite .",
    "the periodic modulation is usually applied to the potential tilt ( bias ) between the lattice sites @xcite or the tunnel coupling @xcite .",
    "for an analytically solvable two - site system , combined modulations have been applied to produce the exact solutions @xcite .",
    "the periodic modulation can be performed in a nonadiabatic @xcite or adiabatic manner @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider single particles held in an optical bipartite lattice with two different separations @xmath0 and @xmath1 and driven by a combined modulation of two resonant external fields with a phase difference between the bias and coupling . in the high - frequency regime and nntb approximation , we derive an analytical general solution for the probability amplitude of the particle in any localized state in which the characterization of quantum tunneling and stability depend on the phase difference between the modulation components .",
    "a new route of cdt and a simple method for stabilizing the system to perform the directed transport are found by adjusting the phase difference adiabatically @xcite or nonadiabatically @xcite",
    ". such a phase - adjustment may be more convenient in experiments compared to the usual amplitude- and frequency - modulations .",
    "the results can be tested with existing experimental setups on the periodically tilted and shaken optical lattices and could be applied to simulating the similar optical systems @xcite and solid - state systems @xcite . at the end of the paper ,",
    "we suggest a scheme for extending the results to a many - particle system .",
    "we consider a driven and tilted bipartite lattice ( double - well train ) of form @xmath2 with time - periodic lattice depths @xcite @xmath3 and potential tilt @xcite @xmath4 between the lattice sites , which consists of the tilted long lattice of wave - vector @xmath5 and short lattice of wave - vector @xmath6 .",
    "such a lattice can be realized experimentally by a periodically shaken optical lattice @xcite , and by imposing a phase modulation to one of the standing wave component fields @xcite or by moving the position of a retroreflecting mirror which is mounted on a piezoelectric actuator @xcite .",
    "a single particle is initially placed near the lattice center , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the different separations @xmath0 and @xmath1 are adjusted by the laser wave vector @xmath5 and amplitudes . here",
    "we have selected a suitable initial time @xmath7 and phase difference @xmath8 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 to make @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "quantum dynamics of such a system is governed by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 means the nearest - neighbor site pairs , @xmath13 for @xmath14 denotes the tunnel coupling @xcite and @xmath15 is the potential tilt @xcite , where @xmath16 is a constant , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the driving intensities and frequency , @xmath19 means the photon resonance .",
    "signs @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the particle creation and annihilation operators in the site @xmath22 .",
    "the spatial locations of the @xmath23th lattice sites read @xmath24 for even integer @xmath23 , and @xmath25 for odd @xmath23 . to simplify",
    ", we have set @xmath26 and normalized energy and time by @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath27 being a fixed reference frequency in order of @xmath16 .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are in units of @xmath27 with @xmath31 being normalized by the fixed reference length @xmath32 m . thus all the parameters are dimensionless throughout this paper .     with two different separations",

    "( 1 ) , from the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath36 we derive the coupled equations of the probability amplitudes @xcite @xmath37 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time . to solve eq . ( 2 ) , we make the function transformation @xmath38 which leads eq.(2 ) to the form @xmath39 in this equation , we have defined @xmath40 such that there are the values @xmath41 for even @xmath23 , and @xmath42 for odd @xmath23 .",
    "we focus our attention on the situation of high - frequency regime with @xmath43 .",
    "the selective cdt has been illustrated analytically and numerically under this limit @xcite .",
    "we shall give a general analytical solution of the system , which reveals the phase - controlled cdt and directed transport .",

    "the phase - adjustment of the periodic shaking can be implemented adiabatically or nonadiabatically , and may be more convenient compared to the usual amplitude- and frequency - modulations .",
    "the directed tunneling is related to the ratchetlike effect of quantum particles , which can be tested with existing experimental setups on the periodically tilted and shaken optical lattices and could be well suited to simulating the similar optical systems @xcite and solid - state systems @xcite , e.g. a periodically tilted and shaken chain of coupled quantum dots .    particularly , in the nntb approximation",
    ", the results can be extended to controlling the directed motion of a many - particle system .",
    "the possible experiment can begin by loading a bose - einstein condensate into the long lattice of wave - vector @xmath5 , then one can tune the lattice depths to make the atomic sample in the mott insulating state with a single atom per well @xcite , so the interparticle onsite interaction is neglectable .",

    "sides of tilted double wells @xcite with distances among particles being equal to the separation summation @xmath161 .",
    "thus we can apply the dl or cdt conditions to suppress pairing or bunching the particles , and make the couple between nearest - neighbor double - wells the neglectable so that the above - mentioned results , such as the phase - controlled dl , cdt and directed transport , hold for the many - particle system . in the dl conditions , every particle of the many - body system synchronously performs the rabi oscillation in one of the double - wells that generates a macromolecule - like in the bipartite lattice . while the directed transport of the many particles will form a stronger particle current , compared to the single particle case .",
