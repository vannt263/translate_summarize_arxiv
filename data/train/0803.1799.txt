    "bose condensates with atomic interactions , in addition to the contact interaction , open the possibility to study the properties of degenerate quantum gases in which the relative strengths of long- and short - range interactions can be continuously adjusted by tuning the contact interaction via a feshbach resonance .",
    "in particular , the bose - einstein condensation of neutral atoms with electromagnetically induced attractive @xmath0 interaction has been proposed . according to odell et al .",
    "@xcite `` monopolar '' quantum gases could be realized by a combination of 6 appropriately arranged `` triads '' of intense off - resonant laser beams . in that arrangement ,",
    "the @xmath1 interactions of the retarded dipole - dipole interaction of neutral atoms in the presence of intense electromagnetic radiation are averaged out in the near - zone limit , while the weaker @xmath0 interaction is retained .",
    "an outstanding feature of this type of long - range interaction is that for attractive contact interaction stable bose - einstein condensates are predicted that are _ self - bound _ ( without an additional trap ) .",
    "despite the fact that a self - bound condensate with attractive @xmath0 interaction has not been realized in an experiment so far , the physical parameters necessary for creating it experimentally were discussed in detail by giovanazzi et al .",
    "@xcite , who also obtained a theoretical prediction for the number of atoms in the self - bound condensate .",
    "furthermore , the existence of stable monopole and quadrupole oscillations around the stationary ground state have been demonstrated and analyzed with analytical and numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the realization of self - bound condensates with attractive @xmath0 interaction in experiments remains a challenging task .",
    "however , experimental realization has been achieved for a similar system with a long - range interaction , viz .",
    "dipolar bose - einstein condensates . here",
    ", the long - range dipole - dipole interaction appears next to the short - range contact term .",
    "the system has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite and the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in a gas of chromium atoms @xcite , with a large dipole moment , has opened the way to promising experiments on dipolar quantum gases @xcite .",
    "for example , the experimental observation of the dipolar collapse of a quantum gas has recently been reported by koch et al.@xcite , which sets in when the contact interaction is reduced below some critical value .",
    "bose - einstein condensates with attractive @xmath0 interaction exhibit a similar collapse scenario .",
    "collapse of the self - bound condensates again only sets in below some critical value of the scattering length .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that these critical values in fact correspond to bifurcation points where two solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation disappear : one the true ground state , the other a collectively excited state .",
    "it was also demonstrated @xcite that at the bifurcation the two stationary solutions exhibit the typical structure known from studies of _ exceptional points _",
    "@xcite in open quantum systems described by non - hermitean hamiltonians . at the exceptional points both the energies _ and",
    "_ the corresponding wave functions are identical , a situation which is forbidden for bound states of the linear schrdinger equation ( which have to be orthogonal ) but is possible here because of the nonlinearity of the gross - pitaevskii equation .    using a complex continuation of the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "the existence of complex eigenstates at ( real ) negative scattering lengths below the bifurcation point has also been revealed @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of these states is the collapse ( or explosion ) of the condensate with a decay rate given by the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues of the chemical potential .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to analyze self - bound spherically symmetric bose condensates with attractive @xmath0 interaction in the vicinity of the bifurcation points from the point of view of nonlinear dynamics , and to investigate the time evolution of arbitrary condensate wave functions .",
    "we do this by solving the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation both by means of a variational approach with time - dependent gaussian wave packets and by exact numerical computations using the split - operator method .",
    "we will show that of the two stationary solutions created in a tangent bifurcation one is dynamically stable and the other unstable , corresponding to elliptic and hyperbolic fixed points , respectively .",
    "the stable state is surrounded by solutions periodically oscillating in time , whereas wave functions in the unstable region undergo a collapse within finite time . below the tangent bifurcation",
    "no stationary solutions exist , i.e. , the condensate is always unstable and collapsing .",
    "the special appeal of investigations of the properties of spherically symmetric self - trapped bose condensates with attractive @xmath0 interaction lies in the fact that the extremization of the variational mean - field energy can be carried out fully analytically .",
    "the reason is that in absence of a trap the extremization conditions for the mean - field energy become quadratic equations , while with a trap potential the equations become at least polynomials of order 5 , caused by the combination of the trap and contact interaction terms , regardless of whether or not a long - range interaction is present , and of its type",
    ". therefore generic properties of bose condensates can be elucidated in a very simple and transparent way , and later be checked in numerical calculations and in more complex systems such as dipolar bose condensates .",
    "the evolution of a wave function is determined by the extended gross - pitaevskii equation for self - trapped bose - einstein condensates with attractive @xmath0 interaction without external trap potential , which reads @xmath2 where the natural `` atomic '' units introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite were used .",
