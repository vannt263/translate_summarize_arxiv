    "after four decades of heroic experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite efforts , see @xcite and references therein , the problems of solar neutrinos have finally been solved .",
    "a unique solution of these problems exists corresponding to lma msw flavor oscillations of active neutrinos . by active neutrinos",
    "we understand those experimentally observed , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "after recent results from superkamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite all other solutions of the solar neutrino problems are not allowed at @xmath7 level @xcite . simultaneously it becomes more and more clear that the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos are due to @xmath8 transitions @xcite .",
    "the third important piece of information is the chooz limit @xcite indicating that the element @xmath1 of the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) lepton mixing matrix @xcite is small . in this article",
    "we show that all these experimental facts can be nicely accommodated by assuming the see - saw mechanism @xcite and a large hierarchy of the dirac masses for three neutrinos .",
    "one can consider the results presented in the present paper as a realistic realization of the ideas proposed in a recent paper by one of us @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that there is no room in this model to explain lsnd results @xcite in terms of oscillations .",
    "this model can not also accommodate the large value of the majorana mass parameter @xmath9 which follows from a recent interpretation @xcite of the heidelberg - moscow data on neutrinoless double beta decays of @xmath10ge @xcite .",
    "let us start with a brief summary of the ideas and results presented in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a rather small hierarchy of the observed low energy masses of the active neutrinos can follow from a large hierarchy at the more fundamental level of the dirac masses .",
    "this can happen even in the case when the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos are degenerate .",
    "therefore large hierarchies in the dirac masses of all other fundamental fermions , i.e. up quarks , down quarks and charged leptons , can be accompanied by a large hierarchy of the dirac masses for the neutrinos .",
    "this large hierarchy is drastically modified by a symmetric unitary operator @xmath0 related to unitary transformations of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "in some sense the underlying hierarchy of the dirac masses is hidden and only mildly reflected in the effective low energy masses .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the see - saw mechanism and the algebraic structure of the low energy effective mass operator @xmath11 describing the masses of the active neutrinos .",
    "therefore , in the lepton sector there are two operators acting in the flavor space which affect the low energy physics in a most important way .",
    "one is the mns lepton mixing matrix @xmath12 @xcite which plays a role similar to that of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix for quarks @xcite .",
    "the other is the matrix @xmath0 which is imprinted in the observable mass spectrum of the active neutrinos .",
    "up to our knowledge this remarkable matrix @xmath0 and its role in the low energy physics of neutrinos was not discussed in the literature before @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a form of @xmath0 has been considered leading to a significant reduction of the mass hierarchy and a form of @xmath12 nicely accommodating the small value of its @xmath1 element .",
    "it has also been argued that the mass ratio for the two lighter active neutrinos is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the mixing angle for solar neutrinos . in the present paper",
    "we show that for strongly hierarchical dirac masses the form of @xmath0 considered in @xcite is up to complex phase factors the only one leading to acceptable low energy mass spectrum and lepton mixing matrix .",
    "we show also that the smallness of @xmath1 and the mass relations are preserved in the realistic model .",
    "in this section the see - saw mechanism for three families of leptons is discussed .",
    "we repeat arguments given in @xcite and show that a small hierarchy of low energy masses can be obtained from a large hierarchy in the dirac masses .",
    "we show that the observed small hierarchy for the active neutrinos fixes the form of the matrix @xmath0 mentioned in the introduction up to some complex phase factors and small sub - leading terms . the mass matrix for the charged leptons can be written as @xmath15 the matrix @xmath16 multiplying @xmath17 from the left side can be made equal to one by an appropriate redefinition of the right - handed charged leptons .",
    "this has no observable consequences because at our low energies only left - handed weak charged currents can be studied .",
    "the corresponding dirac mass matrix for the neutrinos is @xmath18 with @xmath19 we choose the reference frame in the flavor space such that the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos is diagonal . in general in this frame @xmath20 is described by its three different eigenvalues .",
    "however , as we demonstrate in the following , even taking the simplest case of @xmath21 we are able to build a phenomenologically successful model .",
    "the majorana masses of the right - handed neutrinos are equal to @xmath22 , which is huge .",
    "this leads to the masses of active neutrinos much smaller than the masses of other fundamental fermions ( leptons and quarks ) .",
    "of course there is an additional freedom for the right - handed majorana masses not equal to each other but one can describe the neutrino oscillation data without any problem assuming that they are all equal . in our present purely phenomenological approach",
    "we do not have at our disposal a sufficient amount of information to study the mass spectrum of @xmath20 .",
    "this may be possible in a more complete theory of flavor , but in this work we assume degenerate majorana masses",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the arguments which we present can be trivially generalized and applied to the case of non - equal right - handed majorana masses .",
    "the form of the matrix @xmath20 depends on the reference frame in a non - trivial way . in the frame employed in the present paper this matrix",
    "is assumed to be proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "however it may have a different form in another reference frame .",
    "in particular it need not be proportional to the unit matrix in the frame where the matrix of neutrino dirac masses is diagonal and so exhibits a strong hierarchy .",
    "once the reference frame in the flavor space is fixed by the condition that @xmath20 is diagonal the matrix @xmath23 in eq.([eq : n ] ) can not be gauged away by a redefinition of the right - handed neutrino fields .",
    "let us assume that @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are hierarchical @xmath26 which means that the dirac masses of the neutrinos exhibit the same strongly ordered hierarchical pattern as the dirac masses of all other fundamental fermions .",
    "the mass spectrum of the active neutrinos is dictated by an effective mass operator @xmath27 of dimension five @xmath28 the algebraic structure of @xmath27 implies that the resulting mass spectrum is extremely sensitive to the form of @xmath29 where the simplifying assumption ( [ eq : mrequal1 ] ) has been used . the mass spectrum obtained from the matrix @xmath27 in eq.([eq : defn ] ) is now seen to depend crucially on the following matrix @xmath0 , @xmath30 which is symmetric and unitary .",
    "it is remarkable that to some extent the condition ( [ eq : mrequal1 ] ) also fixes the reference frame in the flavor space .",
    "unitary transformations of the right - handed fields are in general complex and can not be gauged away even if @xmath20 is proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath0 can drastically reduce the hierarchy of the mass spectrum for the active neutrinos .",
    "so , @xmath0 is observable , in principle at least , if a large hierarchy of the dirac masses is the common feature of all quarks and leptons . in this sense @xmath0",
    "is a physical object which is imprinted in low energy physical quantities , namely the masses of the active neutrinos . unlike the quark sector with its cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix @xcite the lepton sector",
    "has therefore two important matrices in the flavor space .",
    "one is the lepton mixing matrix @xmath31 @xcite which affects the form of the weak charged current .",
    "another is the matrix @xmath0 defined in eq.([eq : defr ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 affects the form of @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , it is also reflected in the low energy neutrino mass spectrum . in our phenomenological approach",
    "we use the experimental input to fix the form of @xmath0 .",
    "one may hope that this is a first step towards an underlying theory of flavor .",
    "what can be said about the matrix @xmath0 ?",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that its element @xmath32 must be equal to zero at the leading order . by this",
    "we mean that @xmath32 can not be a number of order 1 .",
    "it can be a small number suppressed by some power of the mass ratio of , say , @xmath33 and @xmath25 .",
    "perhaps the easiest way to demonstrate that it must be so is to take @xmath34 which is representative for the whole class of matrices with @xmath35 .",
    "then for the hierarchical mass spectrum ( [ eq : hierarchical ] ) a much stronger hierarchy is obtained for the masses of the active neutrinos @xmath36 it should be stressed that in eq.([activehierarchy ] ) much greater means a few orders of magnitude rather than factors below 10 .",
    "then for the ratio @xmath37 values between @xmath38 and @xmath39 are obtained if the mass ratio @xmath40 is taken of the order of the corresponding mass ratios for other fundamental fermions , i.e. @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "these values of @xmath44 are two to six orders smaller than the experimental value @xmath45 in the above equation the value of @xmath46 from a combined fit to superkamiokande and k2k data @xcite and a recent sno result @xcite for @xmath47 are used . before sno ,",
    "much smaller values of @xmath47 were also allowed for the oscillations of the solar neutrinos .",
    "as we see , if @xmath32 is not equal to zero , then an unacceptably large hierarchy appears in the mass spectrum of the active neutrinos .",
    "this means that @xmath48 must be assumed .",
    "what about @xmath49 ?",
    "it turns out that the resulting mass spectrum for the active neutrinos is acceptable from the phenomenological point of view if @xmath50 is assumed .",
    "this spectrum corresponds to the case of the so - called inverted hierarchy .",
    "however in the following section it will be seen that the resulting structure of the lepton mixing matrix does not resemble the experimentally observed one .",
    "more precisely , one can obtain a realistic mixing matrix assuming a rather artificial form of the charged lepton contribution @xmath51 and some sort of conspiracy and accidental cancellations . for esthetic reasons we do not consider such a situation acceptable and conclude that up to small sub - leading terms",
    "@xmath52 must be assumed .",
    "the only remaining case is @xmath53 which implies @xmath54 the complex phase factors in eq.([eq : r0 ] ) can be of crucial importance for lepton number violating processes like neutrinoless double beta decays .",
    "however , these phase factors do not affect our discussion which concentrates on neutrino oscillations .",
    "so , for the sake of simplicity , in the following considerations we take the same form of @xmath0 as in @xcite : @xmath55 it turns out that for strongly hierarchical dirac masses eq.([eq : r ] ) is a necessary condition for a realistic mixing and mass spectrum .",
    "therefore we assume that some symmetry underlying flavor dynamics forces @xmath23 to fulfill eq.([eq : r ] ) .",
    "unlike @xmath16 in the charged lepton sector which at low energies can be gauged away , the matrix @xmath23 is imprinted in low energy physics and its structure affects the mass spectrum of the active neutrinos in a most spectacular way .",
    "the general solution of eq.([eq : r ] ) is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an arbitrary 3-dimensional rotation and @xmath58 .",
    "the particular solution in ( [ ursolved ] ) has been chosen to be a symmetric matrix .",
    "one may speculate if this interesting matrix plays some role in the theory of flavor .",
    "in this section we study the mns mixing matrix . following @xcite",
    "we show that for the matrix @xmath0 given in eq.([eq : r ] ) the so - called bi - maximal mixing is obtained @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that after sno @xcite the bi - maximal mixing is excluded as a realistic description of the data on neutrino oscillations . moreover , the mass spectrum of the active neutrinos following from eq.([eq : r ] ) is also not realistic because two masses are degenerate implying @xmath59 .",
    "both problems are cured in the following section by adding appropriate sub - leading terms .",
    "importantly , the key observation which we present here survives in the realistic model .",
    "we also show that assuming @xmath60 one obtains another structure of @xmath61 which can not be made realistic without very artificial assumptions .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix @xmath61 relates two sets of neutrino eigenstates : gauge interaction eigenstates @xmath62 and @xmath6 and mass eigenstates @xmath63 of masses @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 let @xmath67 be a unitary matrix such that @xmath68 eq.([eq : l ] ) implies that @xmath69 is diagonalized by @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath70 . then from eqs.([eq : defn])-([eq : defr ] ) one derives @xmath71 where the unitary matrix @xmath72 is such that @xmath73 with @xmath74 , c.f .",
    "eq.([eq : r ] ) . for @xmath75",
    "given in ( [ eq : mnu ] ) one obtains , see the following section for a step by step derivation , @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 the lepton mixing matrix is , cf.([umnsvlo ] ) , @xmath79 the presence of @xmath80 in eq.([umnsvupupi4 ] ) may be considered very embarrassing . multiplying any matrix from the right by @xmath80 results in exchanging its second and third columns .",
    "such an operation may perfectly ruin the structure of this matrix . only for rotations",
    "@xmath81 by @xmath82 in the @xmath83-@xmath84 plane or unitary matrices @xmath85 analogous to @xmath86 in eq.([eq : u12pi4 ] ) the exchange of the second and third column can be easily compensated for by some innocent change of conventions .",
    "but these are exactly the matrices which describe the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos ! if @xmath87 the resulting @xmath31 can be cast in the form @xmath88 by appropriate redefinitions of fields .",
    "this form automatically guarantees that @xmath1 is small .",
    "it is quite encouraging that the condition ( [ vlul ] ) has been realized in many published models , for a review see @xcite .",
    "a particularly attractive option is to assume @xmath89 and to attribute the whole unitary transformation in the @xmath83-@xmath84 plane to the lepton sector .",
    "then ( [ vlul ] ) can be obtained from the lopsided form of @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "eq.([ul1 ] ) nicely agrees with the idea that the analogous matrices for up and down quarks are close to the unit matrix leading to the ckm matrix also close to one .    in grand unified theories like @xmath91 , the mass matrices @xmath90 for leptons and @xmath92 for down quarks",
    "are closely related : @xmath93 this relation originates from the fact that in @xmath91 the charged leptons are in fact closely related to charge conjugated fundamental fermions .",
    "so , for @xmath94 guts , eq.([ul1 ] ) would imply that @xmath95 .",
    "however , in such theories there should be also a close relation between @xmath23 and @xmath51 .",
    "comparing @xmath51 following from ( [ vlul ] ) for @xmath96 and @xmath23 from ( [ ursolved ] ) we do not find such a relation . from ( [ vlul ] ) we can get @xmath97 rather than @xmath98 .",
    "so , we do not know how to realize the scenario described in this paper in @xmath94 unified theories .",
    "after having observed the rather miraculous way the permutation @xmath80 leaves intact the pattern of mixing , it is easier to see why an alternative matrix @xmath99 for @xmath100 is not acceptable phenomenologically .",
    "we can take @xmath101 , see eq.([eq : p23 ] ) , as a representative for the whole corresponding class of matrices . for this choice of @xmath0",
    "we would obtain @xmath102 the corresponding matrix @xmath72 , c.f .",
    "eq.([eq:18 ] ) would be @xmath103 , leading to the lepton mixing matrix @xmath104 as opposed to the expression ( [ umnsvupupi4 ] ) , the emerging mixing pattern is hard to reconcile with data . unlike that of the innocuous matrix @xmath80 in ( [ umnsvupupi4 ] ) ,",
    "the effect of the matrix @xmath105 in ( [ umnsvlo ] ) is deleterious to the structure of @xmath106 since it is now columns @xmath107 and @xmath84 that are swapped . to make @xmath108 realistic",
    ", one would have to resort to replacing the charged lepton matrix @xmath51 with a much less plausible structure .",
    "the central idea of the preceding sections is that the fundamental hierarchy of the dirac masses is drastically deformed by the matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the form of @xmath0 given in eq.([eq : r ] ) is particularly effective in reducing the original hierarchy .",
    "for the same reason the role of the sub - leading terms becomes much more prominent . in this section",
    "we show that realistic models of lepton mixing and neutrino mass spectrum can be easily obtained when these sub - leading terms are taken into account .",
    "of course there is a problem of the large number of free parameters in such purely phenomenological models .",
    "once again we face the fact that the amount of experimental information is very limited .",
    "so , one might argue that only more constrained models based on some underlying symmetry principle can be sufficiently constrained and predictive to go beyond a mere parametrisation of the data .",
    "we show that such a conclusion is too strong .",
    "in fact the large hierarchy of the dirac masses helps to reduce the number of relevant sub - leading terms .",
    "then the masses of the active neutrinos can be related to @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath13 .",
    "these relations , in principle at least , can provide an experimental test of the picture presented here .",
    "sub - leading terms are introduced as small off - diagonal elements in the matrix @xmath75 , see eq.([eq : mnu ] ) and add some sub - leading terms in @xmath23 , c.f .",
    "eq.([eq : n ] ) .",
    "small sub - leading terms in @xmath109 do not affect the mass spectrum of the active neutrinos .",
    "those terms may be very important for the phenomenology of neutrinos because they can affect the value of @xmath1 .",
    "however we have little to say about them . ] . as we want to preserve the hierarchy built in the dirac mass spectrum we assume that all non - zero off - diagonal elements of @xmath75 are small and of order @xmath33 .",
    "then the structure of the mass operator @xmath27 , see eq.([eq : defn ] ) , selects the matrix elements @xmath110 and @xmath111 whose contributions to @xmath27 are multiplied by @xmath25 and thus enhanced .",
    "let us assume that @xmath112 as explained above the contributions to @xmath27 from all other off - diagonal elements of @xmath75 are even smaller and we neglect them in the following discussion .",
    "the mass spectrum and the lepton mixing matrix can be computed numerically for non - zero values of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "it is instructive , however , to consider the case @xmath115 which can be solved analytically in terms of reasonably simple expressions .",
    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that the calculation of the leading contribution to the lepton mixing matrix , which was only sketched in sec.3 , can be obtained from the following considerations for @xmath116 . for @xmath115 @xmath117 and @xmath118 with @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath80 defined in eq.([eq : p23 ] ) exchanges the second and third axes in the flavor space .",
    "for @xmath121 the matrix @xmath122 in ( [ p23mp23 ] ) is diagonalized by @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which implies that @xmath126 and the lepton mixing matrix is , cf.([umnsvlo ] ) , @xmath127 it should be clear from the discussion in sec.3 that the angle @xmath128 in eq.([u12 ] ) is equal to the solar mixing angle @xmath14 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath122 are @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "the ordering of the eigenvalues is such that e.g. the second column of @xmath131 is equal to the normalized eigenvector of @xmath132 for the eigenvalue @xmath133 .",
    "this implies that @xmath134 and @xmath135 the mass splittings are @xmath136 @xmath137 which yields the formula for the parameter @xmath44 , see eq.([eq : rho ] ) , @xmath138 comparison with the allowed range for lma msw solar neutrino oscillations @xcite leads to the following ranges for the values of @xmath113 and @xmath139 : @xmath140 with the best fits corresponding to @xmath113 between 0.46 and 0.57 and @xmath139 between 0.09 and 0.10 .",
    "the same hierarchy as in @xmath90 .",
    "then the parameter @xmath141 is about @xmath142 , which is in the range indicated in eq.([eq : rangeofar ] ) .",
    "we are very much indebted to the referee of plb for pointing this observation out to us . ]",
    "eqs.([eq:38])-([eq:40 ] ) lead to the following approximate formulae for the masses of the active neutrinos : @xmath143 the errors due to approximations leading to these expressions are small for the interesting range of @xmath113 and @xmath139 .",
    "examine now the consequences of other perturbations of the dirac mass matrix .",
    "variation of the second important off - diagonal element , @xmath111 , shows that for non - zero values of the parameter @xmath114 , see eq.([eq : m13 ] ) , the mass relations ( [ eq:41])-([eq:43 ] ) are only weakly affected . in fig.1",
    "we show the test of the mass relation ( [ eq:38 ] ) for a few values of @xmath114 .",
    "the ratio plotted in fig.1 is one if the formula ( [ eq:38 ] ) is exact .",
    "it is seen that corections for non - zero values of @xmath114 are small . in fig.2",
    "we show the result of the analogous test of the formula ( [ eq:41 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that it also works quite well .",
    "non - zero @xmath114 affects the atmospheric mixing angle , yielding roughly @xmath144 . thus we must require that @xmath145 if @xmath146 is to be obtained without artificial conspiracy of contributions from the charged lepton and neutrino sectors .",
    "we think that maximal or nearly maximal mixing for the atmospheric neutrinos is an experimental fact which is too striking to assume that it is simply accidental and results from adding two contributions of similar size .",
    "it is worth noting that even though we have succeeded in keeping @xmath1 zero , which is a non - trivial consequence of the structure of the lepton and neutrino mass matrices , it is nevertheless possible to introduce such a perturbation as to obtain any value of @xmath1 being in accordance with the present experimental data , i.e. @xmath147 .",
    "this is effected by varying another off - diagonal element of the dirac matrix , @xmath148 .",
    "one gets an approximate relation @xmath149 .",
    "let us close this section with two remarks on the numerical values of the mass parameters in our picture .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate , see eq.([eq:41 ] ) , is about 3 mev for @xmath150 .",
    "this mass range can be probed by the 10 t version of the genius project@xcite if the majorana phases are not too small and there are no strong cancellations between contributions to the mass parameter @xmath151 . as a final remark",
    "let us note that the mass scale of the majorana masses is between @xmath152 and @xmath153 gev if @xmath154 is assumed .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that this is exactly the range of majorana masses which may be important for baryogenesis ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it has been shown that the dirac masses of all fundamental fermions can exhibit a strong hierarchy .",
    "a rather small hierarchy of the low energy neutrino masses is due to the symmetric unitary operator @xmath0 acting in the flavor space .",
    "this phenomenon results from the see - saw mechanism and the algebraic structure of the dimension five effective mass operator @xmath155 describing the masses of the active neutrinos . in the leptonic sector",
    "there are two operators acting in the flavor space and observable at low energies : the @xmath12 lepton mixing matrix and the matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the matrix @xmath0 affects the form of @xmath12 and , moreover , also the low energy mass spectrum .",
    "the form of @xmath0 proposed in @xcite leads to a realistic description of neutrino mixing and masses .",
    "the mass of the heaviest neutrino is related to the mass scale @xmath156 governing the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the masses of the two lighter neutrinos are related to @xmath157 , the mass scale for oscillations of solar neutrinos and to the solar neutrino mixing angle through the relation @xmath158 .",
    "the structure of the lepton mixing matrix @xmath12 strongly suggests that the maximal or nearly maximal mixing for the atmospheric neutrinos results from the charged lepton sector .",
    "small @xmath1 is obtained as a consequence of the model .",
    "the mass @xmath159 of the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate is about 3 mev which can be observed by 10 t genius detector if majorana phases are not too small and there are no strong cancellations between contributions to the mass parameter @xmath151 .",
