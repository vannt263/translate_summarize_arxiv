    "the poisson distribution is used to describe a variety of different processes .",
    "it is used very often in the analysis of data from the experimental sets in accelerator physics , in cosmic rays physics , in radioactive decay studies , in fluctuations of energy losses of a particle moving in the matter and in many other cases .",
    "the only parameter that describes the distribution is the rate of events @xmath1 or the average number of events per unit time .",
    "the assumption that this parameter is constant gives the poisson distribution unique features and a certain beauty , however limits its applications .",
    "consider a several hundred @xmath2 electron beam going through a monochromatic photon beam going in the opposite direction .",
    "an electron going through the photon beam , can have several interactions with photons , and the energy of the electron will drop down by an order of magnitude after 2 interactions .",
    "the probability of the interaction of the electron with the monochromatic photon beam of a particular energy is defined by the energy of the electron . in this situation",
    "the rate @xmath1 of the poisson process , which describes the probability of the electron - photon interaction changes dramatically after each interaction , for this reason even for an estimate of the number of the electron - photon interactions the poisson distribution can not be used .",
    "next we consider a process of shooting down a military aircraft with shells .",
    "the probability of hitting the aircraft grows after each consecutive hit , as its flying characteristics as well as defense systems go down and it becomes an easier target to hit .",
    "there could be different scenarios which describe variations of @xmath3 .",
    "clearly the classical poison distribution will not describe the process correctly and this problem requires generalization of the poisson distribution .",
    "also it is quite natural , that after the interaction the properties of the detector change , which leads to the change of the rate of the detection of events .",
    "for example the detection efficiency can degrade after the interaction of the particle with the detector .    in these examples ,",
    "the rate of observed events during the observation period varies considerably , while during the period of constant rate @xmath1 the observed process is the poisson process .",
    "these examples show that it can be useful to find distribution of events in processes where average rate changes . in this paper",
    "we consider a process where the rate @xmath1 changes after each consecutive event is happening , and the process for any length of time between events is poisson , with different rates @xmath4 .",
    "in general the problem can be formulated as follows : find a probability that for a given period of time @xmath5 there would be @xmath6 consecutive events , when the average rate of events @xmath1 is not constant , but changes instantaneously after each consequent event .",
    "before the first event the rate is @xmath7 , immediately after the first event and before the second event it is @xmath8 , immediately after the second event and before third event * @xmath9 * , immediately after event @xmath10 and before event @xmath6 the rate is @xmath3 . in each interval between consecutive events",
    "the rate is constant .    generally speaking @xmath11 are independent finite positive numbers .",
    "we will consider that all of these numbers are different unless specifically stated otherwise .",
    "the solution of the problem is the generalization of the poisson distribution which we look for .",
