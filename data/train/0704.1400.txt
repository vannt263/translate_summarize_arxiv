    "galaxy clusters provide one of the most powerful tools to constrain the key cosmological parameters . in the era of precision cosmology",
    ", it is important to determine their mass as accurately as possible before using them as a cosmological probe .",
    "any kind of simplified assumption about the properties of galaxy clusters could cause substantial systematics in the mass estimation .",
    "the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are one of such properties .",
    "it has been long known both observationally and numerically that the galaxy clusters are noticeably triaxial ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while plenty of efforts have been already made to take into account the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters @xcite , previous studies have been largely focused on the statistical treatment of cluster triaxiality",
    "for the measurement of the gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters that can provide powerful constraints on the density parameter and the dark energy equation of state @xcite , however , it is necessary to deal with the individual clusters and their triaxial shapes .",
    "the standard picture based on the cosmic web theory @xcite explains that galaxy clusters are rare events corresponding to the local maxima of the initial density field and form at the dense nodes of the local filaments in the cosmic web through tidal interactions with the surrounding matter . the tidal effect from the surrounding matter results in the deviation of cluster shapes from spherical symmetry as well as the preferential alignments of cluster galaxies ( or halos ) with the major axes of their host clusters @xcite .    in the frame of this standard scenario , (",
    "* hereafter , lk06 ) have recently developed an analytic algorithm to reconstruct the triaxial shapes of individual clusters .",
    "the key concept of the lk06 algorithm is that the two axial ratios of a triaxial cluster are related to the eigenvalues of the local tidal shear tensor . by measuring the spatial alignment of the cluster galaxies with the major axis of their host cluster",
    ", one can determine the eigenvalues of the local tidal tensor , which will in turn yields the two axial ratios of a triaxial cluster .",
    "testing their analytic model against high - resolution n - body simulations , lk06 have shown that their algorithm works well within @xmath4 errors .",
    "now that the lk06 algorithm is known to work in principle , it is time to test the algorithm against observations .",
    "our goal here is to apply the lk06 algorithm to real observational data and examine its validity in practice . here",
    ", we use the virgo cluster as a target , whose triaxial shape has been very recently measured observationally @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  2 , a brief overview of the lk06 algorithm",
    "is provided and how to incorporate the two dimensional projection effect into the algorithm is explained . in  3 , the virgo cluster data are analyzed and its triaxial shapes are reconstructed using the lk06 algorithm . in  4 ,",
    "the results are summarized , and the advantages and the caveats of our model are discussed .",
    "according to the lk06 algorithm , the cluster triaxial shape originates from its tidal interaction with the surrounding matter distribution .",
    "this assumption has been verified from high - resolution n - body simulation which demonstrated clearly that the tidal field elongates the cluster shapes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "lk06 has shown that the two axial ratios of a triaxial cluster are related to the three eigenvalues of the local tidal tensor defined as the second derivative of the gravitational potential : @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( with @xmath7)are the three principal axis lengths of a cluster and @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) are the three eigenvalues of the local tidal tensor , @xmath10 . according to this formula , one can estimate the cluster axial ratios if @xmath11 is fixed by fitting the probability density distribution , @xmath12 analytically to the observational data .",
    "lk06 suggested that the preferential locations of the cluster galaxies near the cluster major axes given the local tidal tensor be described as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unit position vector of a cluster galaxy , @xmath15 is the unit tidal shear tensor , and @xmath16 $ ] is the correlation parameter that represents the correlation strength between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . under the assumption that the minor axis of the tidal shear tensor is in the direction of the cluster major axis , equation ( [ eqn : corr ] ) basically describes the alignment between the position of a cluster galaxy and the major axis of its host cluster .",
    "if @xmath19 , there is a maximum alignment .",
    "if @xmath20 , there is a maximum anti - alignment .",
    "the case of @xmath21 corresponds to no alignment .",
    "let @xmath22 be the angle between the host cluster major axis and the galaxy position vector . under the assumption that the cluster major axis is in the direction of the minor principal axis of the tidal shear tensor , the probability density distribution of @xmath23 was derived by lk6 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an azimuthal angle of @xmath17 measured in an arbitrary coordinate system . here , covariance matrix @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 .",
    "note that equation ( [ eqn : gen ] ) holds good for any arbitrary coordinate system in which the tidal shear tensor is not necessarily diagonal .    in the principal axis frame of the tidal tensor , equation ( [ eqn : pri ] ) can be expressed only in terms of the three eigenvalues of the tidal shear tensor as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the eigenvalues of @xmath18 , related to @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the linear density threshold for a dark halo @xcite satisfying the following constraint of @xmath33 .",
    "the key concept of lk06 algorithm is that by fitting equation ( [ eqn : gen ] ) to the observed probability distribution , one can find the best - fit values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and then determine the cluster axial ratios using equation ( [ eqn : axi ] ) .",
    "although lk06 algorithm allows us in principle to reconstruct the three dimensional intrinsic triaxial shapes of individual clusters , it is restricted to the cases where the informations on the three dimensional positions of the cluster galaxies in the cluster principal axis frame are given .",
    "unfortunately , for most clusters , these informations are not available but only two dimensional projected images of clusters .    in @xmath36",
    ", we attempt to modify the lk06 algorithm in order to incorporate the two dimensional projection effect .",
    "let us suppose that the position vectors of the cluster galaxies are all projected along the line of sight direction onto the plane of a sky . unless the major axis of the host cluster is perfectly aligned with the line - of - sight direction to the cluster center , one would expect that the projected position vectors of the cluster galaxies should show a tendency to be aligned with the projected major principal axes",
    ".    let @xmath37 be the angle between the projected cluster major axis and galaxy position vector in the plane of sky .",
    "the probability distribution can be calculated by integrating equation ( [ eqn : gen ] ) along the line of sight as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is now chosen to be in the direction of the line of sight .",
    "in other words , we consider a certain cartesian coordinate system in which the @xmath40 direction is parallel to the line of the sight to the cluster center of mass .",
    "note that in this coordinate system the tidal tensor is not necessarily diagonal .    through the similarity transformation @xmath41 with @xmath42 one",
    "can express the nondiagonal unit tidal tensor @xmath18 in terms of its eigenvalues.here , the rotation matrix @xmath43 has the form of @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the polar coordinate of the line - of - sight direction in the principal axis frame of the cluster .    through equations ( [ eqn:2dp])-([eqn : bin ] )",
    ", we finally final an analytic expression for the probability density distribution of @xmath46 in terms of @xmath47 and the correlation parameter @xmath35 : @xmath48 with the factor @xmath49 defined as @xmath50(a_1\\hat{\\lambda}_{1}+a_2\\hat{\\lambda}_{2 }          + a_3\\hat{\\lambda}_{3})(1 - \\hat{x}^{2}_{3 } ) , \\nonumber \\\\     & & + [ ( 1 + s)^2 - 3s(1 + s)](c_1\\hat{\\lambda}_{1 } + c_2\\hat{\\lambda}_{2 }   + c_3\\hat{\\lambda}_{3})\\hat{x}^{2}_{3 } , \\nonumber \\\\     & & +   6s(1 + s)(b_1\\hat{\\lambda}_{1}+ b_2\\hat{\\lambda}_{2 } +   b_3\\hat{\\lambda}_{3})\\hat{x}_{3}\\sqrt{1 - \\hat{x}^{2}_{3}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath51 are given as @xmath52 with this new modified algorithm in the two dimensional space , we can reconstruct the intrinsic shape of a triaxial cluster halo from the observed two dimensional image .",
    "the virgo cluster is the nearest richly populated cluster of galaxies whose properties has been studied fruitfully for long . it is known to have approximately @xmath0 member galaxies @xcite and located at a distance of approximately @xmath53 mpc from us @xcite with the major axis inclined at an angle of approximately @xmath54 with respect to the line of sight @xcite .    near the center of the virgo cluster",
    "is located the large ellipticity galaxy @xmath55 ( or virgo a ) .",
    "the major axis of the virgo cluster is found to be inclined approximately @xmath56 with respect to the line of sight direction to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we use data from the virgo cluster catalogue @xcite which compiles the equatorial coordinates of total @xmath0 member galaxies .",
    "let @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent the three dimensional distance to a member galaxy and its equatorial coordinates , respectively . under the assumption that the position of @xmath55 is the center of mass of the virgo cluster , the cartesian coordinate of a member galaxy in the center of mass frame can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the position of @xmath55 .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of @xmath55 is measured to be @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the distance to virgo a , @xmath63 , from us is also known to be approximately @xmath53mpc ( @xcite ; sbf survey ) .",
    "thus , we have a full information on @xmath60 .",
    "now let us consider a coordinate system where the third axis is in in the direction of the line of sight to @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the spherical polar coordinate of the member galaxy in this coordinate system .",
    "it can be found through coordinate transformation as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the polar coordinate of m87 , so that @xmath67 .    in the plane of sky projected along the line of sight direction , the spherical polar coordinates of the member galaxy can be regarded as the cartesian coordinates as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "basically , it represents a two dimensional projected position of a virgo cluster member galaxy in the plane of sky with the position of @xmath55 as a center .    for each member galaxy from the virgo cluster catalogue",
    ", we have determined the two dimensional projected position @xmath71 using the given equatorial coordinates .      to measure the alignments between the positions of the virgo cluster galaxies and the projected major axis of the virgo cluster and compare the distribution of the alignment angles with the analytic model ( eq.[[eqn:2dp ] ] ) ,",
    "it is necessary to find the direction of the projected major axis in the coordinate system of @xmath72 .",
    "equivalently , it is necessary to have an information on the polar coordinates of the line of sight , @xmath73 with respect to the three dimensional principal axis of the virgo cluster .",
    "the seminal paper of @xcite provides us with the information on @xmath74 i.e. , the angle between the three dimensional major axis of the virgo cluster and the line of sight direction as approximately @xmath56 .",
    "however , we still need the azimuthal angle @xmath75 of the major axis of the virgo cluster .    to find the azimuthal angle @xmath75 , we first let @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the analytic model ( eq.[[eqn:2dp ] ] ) .",
    "it implies that we choose a certain cartesian coordinates @xmath78 where the angle @xmath75 vanishes .",
    "then , we transform the coordinate system of @xmath72 into this new coordinate system as @xmath79 here , note that @xmath80 corresponds to the projected major axis of the virgo cluster in the @xmath72 coordinate system .",
    "it is expected that in this new @xmath78-coordinate system the the observationally measured distribution should fit the analytic model ( eq.[[eqn:2dp ] ] best .    for a given @xmath75",
    ", we measure the alignment angle between the projected major axis and position vector of each virgo cluster galaxy as @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "then , by counting the number of galaxies galaxy s number density as a function of @xmath83 , we can derive the probability distribution , @xmath84 .",
    "we fit this observational distribution with the analytic model , adjusting the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 through @xmath85-minimization .",
    "we repeart the whole process varying the value of @xmath75 , and seek for the value of @xmath75 which yields the smallest @xmath85 value . as a final step ,",
    "we determine the corresponding best - fit values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "finally , we find the axial ratios of the virgo cluster to be @xmath88 and @xmath89 by using equation ( [ eqn : axi ] ) with the constraint of @xmath33 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath35 is also determined to be @xmath90 , indicating that the positions of the cluster galaxies are indeed aligned with the major axes of the virgo cluster .",
    "figure [ [ fig : plane ] ] plots the two dimensional projected positions of the virgo cluster galaxies in the @xmath78-coordinate system .",
    "the arrow represents the direction of the projected major axis determined from the chosen value of @xmath75 .",
    "figure [ fig : fit ] plots the probability distribution of the alignment angles for four different cases of @xmath75 . in each panel ,",
    "the histogram with poisson errors is the observational distribution while the solid line represents the analytic fitting model .",
    "the dotted line stands for the case of no alignment at all .",
    "the top left panel corresponds to the finally chosen value of @xmath75 for which the analytic fitting model and the observational result agree with each other best .",
    "the other three panels show the three exemplary cases of @xmath75 for which the analytic fitting model and the observational result do not agree with each other well with relatively high @xmath85 value .    to investigate whether the reconstructed axial ratios of the virgo cluster changes with the radius from the center , we introduce a cut - off radius , @xmath91 , and remeasure the axial ratios using only those galaxies located within @xmath91 from the center in the @xmath78- corrodinate system .",
    "we repeat the same process but using four different values of @xmath91 .",
    "table [ tab : fit ] lists the values of the resulting best - fit axial ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and the best - fit correlation parameter for the four different cut - off radii of @xmath94 .",
    "as can be seen , at the inner radius smaller than the maximum one , the shape tends to be more prolate - like , consistent with recent numerical report ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note also that the value of @xmath35 is consistently @xmath90 , which implies the strength of the tidal interaction with surrounding matter is consistent .",
    "figure [ fig : radii ] plots the probability distributions for the four different cases of @xmath91 .",
    "the top left panel shows the case of maximum cut - off radius .",
    "as can be seen , the agreements between the analytic fitting model and the observational result are quite good even at inner radii .",
    "we have modified the cluster reconstruction algorithm which was originally developed by @xcite to apply it to the two dimensional projected images of galaxy clusters in practice . assuming that unless the cluster major axes are in the line - of - sight direction , we have found that the alignments between the galaxy positions and the projected major axes can be used to reconstruct the two axial ratios of the triaxial clusters .",
    "we have applied the modified algorithm to the observational data of the virgo cluster and shown that the reconstructed axial ratios of ( @xmath1 : @xmath2 : @xmath3 ) are in good agreement with the recent report from the virgo cluster survey @xcite , which proves the validity and usefulness of our method in practice .",
    "now that the virgo cluster is found to be triaxial , let us discuss on the triaxiality effect on the mass estimation . for simplification ,",
    "let us assume that the virgo cluster has a uniform density .",
    "then , the mass of the triaxial virgo cluster with the axial ratios given as @xmath95 is estimated to be @xmath96 times larger than the spherical case since the spherical radius is close to the minor axis length of the virgo cluster since the major axis of the virgo cluster is very well aligned with the line of sight direction .",
    "therefore , it can cause maximum @xmath97 errors to neglect the virgo cluster triaxiality .",
    "the most prominent merit of our method over the previous one is that it reconstructs directly the _ intrinsic three dimensional structures _ of the underlying triaxial dark matter halo using the fact that the cluster triaxiality originated from the tidal interaction .",
    "conventionally , the triaxial shape of a cluster is found through calculating its inertia momentum tensor .",
    "this conventional method , however , is unlikely to yield the _ intrinsic _ shape of the underlying dark matter halo unless the target cluster is a well relaxed system .",
    "in addition , our method does not resort to any simplified assumption like the axis - symmetry or the alignment with the line - of - sight and etc .",
    "yet , it is worth mentioning here a couple of limitations of our method .",
    "first , it assumes that the major axes of the clusters are not aligned with the line - of - sight direction so that the alignments between the galaxy positions and the projected major axes can be measured .",
    "second , for the virgo cluster , the crucial information on the angle @xmath74 between the three dimensional major axis and the line of sight has been already given @xcite . which simplifies the whole of our method since it was only @xmath75 that has to be determined .",
    "for most clusters , however , this information is not given , so that both the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 have to be determined through fitting before finding the axial ratios .",
    "third , its success is subject to the validity of the lk06 algorithm .",
    "according to the numerical test , the lk06 algorithm suffers approximately @xmath4 errors for the case that the number of the member galaxies is not high enough .",
    "it implies that the lk06 algorithm is definitely restricted to the rich clusters with large numbers of galaxies .",
    "therefore , it may be necessary to refine and improve the lk06 algorithm itself for the application to poor cluster samples .",
    "our future work is in this direction .",
