    "choudhari and deo @xcite considered the influence of disclination on electronic properties of a single graphene layer with intrinsic and rashba type soc and found the energy spectrum for a modified kane - mele hamiltonian .",
    "in this paper we use the modified kane - mele hamiltonian for disclinated single - layer graphene with intrinsic soc contribution in the presence of topological defect induced magnetic flux and a uniform magnetic field in order to study the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of energy spectrum for the landau levels in this geometry . some physical implications of the found results will be discussed .",
    "in this section we analyse the low - energy electronic properties of disclinated graphene layer within the kane - mele model in the presence of an intrinsic soc contribution . recall that such systems can be reasonably treated introducing a multi - dimensional tight - binding bases . to describe graphene ,",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is used which allows for hopping of electrons between nearest neighbors ( from one sublattice to another ) in a manner that electrons on an atom of the type @xmath4 can hop on the three nearest @xmath5 atoms . by taking into account the hopping between next - to - nearest neighbors ( introduced by haldane @xcite ) ,",
    "we can write down the resulting kane - mele @xcite hamiltonian as follows : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the nearest and next - to - nearest neighbors hopping amplitudes , respectively .",

    "the introduction of a topological defect into graphene lattice is the volterra process@xcite .",
    "this process involves a `` cut and glue '' procedure obeying the symmetry of hexagonal lattice .",
    "for example , the creation of one disclination in graphene lattice can be `` viewed '' by removing or inserting an angular sector @xmath30 of the hexagonal lattice , where @xmath31 is an integer which belongs to the interval @xmath32 .",
    "this procedure is responsible for the formation of a conical defect in graphene layer .",
    "if we remove a sector @xmath33 , a five - membered ring ( positive wedge disclination ) appears at the apex .",
    "if we insert a sector @xmath34 , a heptagon - membered ring ( negative wedge disclination ) appears in the apex of conical space .",
    "the low - energy continuum limit for treating the graphene layer with disclination can be described by geometric theory of defects @xcite .",
    "it is based on the metric that contains all information about the elastic deformations caused by the disclination @xcite .",
    "this approach is similar to geometric theory of gravity with curvature and torsion .",
    "the conical geometry can be presented in various ways . in the present paper",
    "we use two representations .",
    "the first representation ( related to the `` unfolded plane '' concept @xcite ) is based on intrinsic characterization and uses an euclidean geometry with incomplete angular range which is given by the following metric @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the second representation describes a cone embedded in three - dimensional flat space and is given by the metric @xmath39 where @xmath36 and @xmath40 .",
    "the connection between the above two representations is realized through the relation @xmath41 .",
    "the topological defects are known to affect the electronic properties of graphene @xcite . in particular ,",
    "such defect can be introduced via quantum fluxes of fictitious gauge fields through the apex of the conical space . in this way the transport parallel to the wave function with spin around disclination",
    "@xcite produces a non - trivial holonomy .",
    "thus , to include the mismatch of the phases of the spinor base wave functions , we have to perform a gauge transformation of the spinor @xmath42^{t}$ ] due to the defect in the graphene layer . these phases introduced by fictitious gauge fields in the envelope function of spinor are responsible for making the total eigenspinor single - valued . the general holonomy that describes these fluxes in honeycomb lattice with disclination",
    "is given by @xmath43 this holonomy manifests itself as a change of reference frames in space in the presence of topological defect and the consequent change of the spinor due to the mismatch of `` cut and glue '' process .",
    "we can rewrite the expression for holonomy ( [ holonomy ] ) in two contributions .",
    "one is given by @xmath44 and is due to the parallel transport of spinor around the apex of cone in a closed path , thus proving the variation of the local reference frame along the path  @xcite . as is pointed out in  @xcite , @xmath45 is responsible for @xmath46 translation in co - rotating spinor .",
    "the other holonomy @xmath47 is of aharonov - bohm - type  @xcite contribution @xcite and it introduces a matrix - valued gauge field in the hamiltonian of the system leading to @xmath48 let us consider now the two external magnetic fields .",

    "its appearance in conical space has been discussed in much detail in @xcite .",
