    "astrophysical black holes are the terminal states of the gravitational collapse of massive celestial objects that can be conceived as singularities in space time censored by a mathematically defined ` one way barrier '  the event horizon , and are not amenable to any direct physical observation . as a result",
    ", their presence can only be realized through the gravitational influence they exerts on the matter accreting onto those objects .",
    "the infalling matter inevitably plunges through the event horizon on a relativistic scale of velocity .",
    "given a set of physically realizable outer boundary conditions , such accretion eventually manifests transonic properties to obey the aforementioned inner boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "subsonic at a large distance , accretion thus reaches the event horizon supersonically .    the hypothesis that most ( if not all ) of the supermassive black holes and the stellar mas black holes powering the active galactic nuclei and the galactic micro quasars respectively possesses non zero value of spin angular momentum has gained widespread currency in recent times @xcite . the black hole spin plays a deterministic role in influencing various characteristic features of the the dynamical and spectral features of accretion and related phenomena in the characteristic black hole metric  the energy extraction from a kerr black hole through the blandford znajek mechanism @xcite , the spin dependence of the black hole shadow imaging @xcite , various evolutionary properties of the normal and the active galaxies @xcite , and the qpo phenomena associated with the extra - galactic sources @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "the aforementioned issues necessitate investigation of how the black hole spin angular momentum , i.e. , the kerr parameter @xmath0 , influences the dynamical and the radiative behaviour of the general relativistic transonic accretion at the close vicinity of the event horizon of a rotating black hole .",
    "the central objective of our work presented in this paper is to investigate what properties of the accretion flow are the principal attributes of the black hole spin at the extreme close proximity of the event horizon of a rotating black hole .    to accomplish such task , we conduct a detailed and multi - step investigation of the transonic properties of general relativistic axisymmetric hydrodynamic inviscid accretion of low angular momentum as realized on the equatorial plane of the kerr metric using the boyer linsquist @xcite co - ordinate .",
    "we begin with a general prescription where we consider a four dimensional stationary axisymmetric manifold with two commuting killing vector fields and subsequently construct the general relativistic euler and the continuity equation from the appropriate energy momentum tensor .",
    "quite interestingly , we have been able to demonstrate , using certain symmetry arguments , that for the three dimensional submanifold the fluid equations are separable using analytical scheme and the corresponding flow velocity components can completely be determined once the equation of state is specified .",
    "we thus formulate a general framework for studying the equations for fluid flow in rotating black hole spacetime .",
    "the transonic flow properties in phase portrait , however , can not be determined completely analytically for certain issues which will be elaborated in the subsequent sections . for such purpose , we demonstrate the equivalence between the set of differential equations describing the space gradient of the stationary flow velocity and that of the acoustic perturbation ( stationary barotropic sound speed ) , and the first order autonomous dynamical systems .",
    "the emergence of the multi - transonic behaviour manifests through the critical point analysis .",
    "such multi - transonic accretion solution , as we will see in the subsequent sections , may contain stationary shock , properties of which are obtained by the explicit solution of the general relativistic rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "the properties of the post shock flow are then studied as a function of the black hole spin  the kerr parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the post shock flow solution are then followed upto a sufficiently close proximity of the event horizon to demonstrate how the terminal values of the shocked accretion variables are influenced by the black ole spin angular momentum , and the consequences of such dependence are discussed in detail .",
    "the entire procedure to the study the spin dependence of the behaviour of accreting matter close to the event horizon as described above is based on the stationary solutions of the differential equations describing the accretion phenomena .",
    "along with the understanding of the transonic behaviour of the stationary flow solutions , it is equally important ( rather necessary ) to ensure the stability of such stationary configurations .",
    "criteria for such sustained stability can be examined by studying the time evolution of a linear acoustic like perturbation ( applied around the stationary configuration ) in the full time dependent flow equations .",
    "the existence of the stable stationary transonic solution is associated with the non - divergent linear perturbation of the aforementioned kind . in this work ,",
    "we develop a novel linear perturbation scheme applicable to the axisymmetric potential flow as realized on the equatorial plane of the kerr metric .",
    "we perturb the velocity potential corresponding to the advective velocity of the low angular momentum accretion considered in our work and demonstrate that such perturbation does not diverge in any significant astrophysically relevant time scale .",
    "we thus formally establish the consistency of the formalism , which , for the first time in the literature , has been introduced in the present work to study the black hole spin dependence of the terminal behaviour of accreting matter at the extreme close vicinity of the event horizon of a kerr black hole .",
    "for accretion onto astrophysical black holes , the transonicity is characterised by a transition from the subsonic state ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mach number of the flow ) to the supersonic state ( @xmath3 ) , or vice versa . for the present work ,",
    "the mach number @xmath2 is considered to be the local radial mach number for stationary transonic accretion solution . for our purpose , we define @xmath2 to be the ratio of the local advective velocity @xmath4 ( defined in the subsequent section ) and the local speed of the propagation of the acoustic perturbation ( local barotropic sound speed ) @xmath5 as defined in the subsequent section",
    ". such transition may be a regular one through the sonic point and is associated with the transition of @xmath6 type or may be a discontineous one through a stationary shock and is associated with the @xmath7 type transition . as a consequence of the fact that the non linear equations describing the steady , inviscid stationary axisymmetric flow can be tailored to form a first order autonomous dynamical system , the physical transonic accretion solution for the stationary axisymmetric flow can formaly be realized as critical solution on the phase portrait spanned by @xmath2 and the radial distance measured from the event horizon ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .    for low angular momentum sub - keplerian accretion ,",
    "such transonic features may be exhibited more than once on the phase portrait of the stationary solutions .",
    "such multi - transonicity as well as the resulting shock formation phenomena for axisymmetric accretion under the influence of various post newtonian potentials , mainly , under the influence of the paczyski and wiita @xcite pseudo - schwarzschild potential , has been widely studied in the literature , see e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "since a regular stationary accretion solution can not encounter more than one transonic point , multi - transonicity implies a particular flow configuration with three critical points where two transonic solutions through two different saddle type critical points are connected by a discontineous staionary shock transition . the inner boundary condition imposed by teh",
    "event horizon indicates that such a combined multi - transonic shocked solution originates from a large distance as a subsonic flow and encounters the outermost saddle type sonic point to become supersonic for the fist time .",
    "subjected to the appropriate initial boundary conditions , such supersonic flow makes a @xmath8 type discontinous transition through a staionary shock and the shock induced subsonic flow becomes supersonic again at the innermost saddle type sonic point .",
    "one expects that a shock formation in black - hole accretion discs might be a general phenomenon because shock waves in rotating astrophysical flows potentially provide an important and efficient mechanism for conversion of a significant amount of the gravitational energy into radiation by randomizing the directed infall motion of the accreting fluid .",
    "hence , the shocks play an important role in governing the overall dynamical and radiative processes taking place in astrophysical fluids accreting onto black holes .",
    "the hot and dense post shock flow is considered to be a powerful diagnostic tool in understanding various astrophysical phenomena like the spectral properties of the galactic black hole candidates ( @xcite ) and that of the supermassive black hole at our galactic centre ( @xcite ) , the formation and dynamics of accretion powered galactic and extra - galactic outflows ( @xcite ) , shock induced nucleosynthesis in the black hole accretion disc and the metalicity of the intergalactic matter ( @xcite and references therein ) , and the origin of the quasi - periodic oscillation in galactic and extra - galactic sources ( @xcite and references therein ) , to mention a few .",
    "the idea of shock formation in black hole accretion flow has however contested by some authors ( see , e , g , . @xcite and references therein for a review ) .",
    "nevertheless , the issue of not finding shocks in such works perhaps lies in the fact that only one sonic point close to the black hole may usually be explored using the framework of the shock free advection dominated accretion flow solutions .    at this point",
    "we would like to emphasize that the concept of low angular momentum ( allowing the multi - transonicity and the shock formation ) is not a theoretical abstraction .",
    "rather for realistic astrophysical systems , such sub - keplerian weakly rotating flows are exhibited in various physical situations , such as detached binary systems fed by accretion from ob stellar winds ( @xcite ) , semi - detached low - mass non - magnetic binaries ( @xcite ) , and super - massive black holes fed by accretion from slowly rotating central stellar clusters ( @xcite and references therein ) . even for a standard keplerian accretion disc",
    ", turbulence may produce such low angular momentum flow ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "multi - transonicity in black hole accretion has been addressed using the general relativistic framework as well .",
    "the legacy of the pioneering contributions by @xcite and @xcite to study the general relativistic axisymmetric black hole accretion in the kerr metric followed two different avenues , quite often in a non overlapping fashion .",
    "one school of thought essentially studied the transonic accretion without paying much attention to the appearance of the multi - transonicity and the formation of shock , but rather putting emphasis on other crucial behaviours of the flow , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the appearance of the multiple critical points nn general relativistic flow onto a spinning black hole was observed and consequently the formation of the standing shock has been conjectured in the alternative set of ( sometime contesting the aforementioned category of work dealing with accretion flow without the appearance of shock transition ) literature , with the main motivation to explain the spectral state by incorporating the physics of the post shock accretion flow , as already mentioned in the previous sections . the profound work by @xcite is credited as the first ever consistent attempt to provide the complete formalism for the shock formation in a multiply critical accretion flow in the kerr metric , although it is worth mentioning that even before @xcite , multiplicity in the critical points for the general relativistic axisymmetric flow was addressed @xcite without mentioning the issue of the shock formation . by revisting",
    "the concept of the keplerian circular motion for rotating fluids in general relativity @xcite intuitively explained certain issues related to the shock formation for multi - transonic accretion onto a kerr black hole .",
    "the full general relativistic formalism introduced by @xcite and @xcite was followed by @xcite where a non relativistic calculation for the shock formation for accretion ( in the hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction ",
    "the flow model we consider in our persent work ) and other issues were incorporated within the relativistic framework and some of the results valid for the isothermal flow had directly been applied to study the polytropic flow without adequate justification .",
    "some of such discrepancies has recently been modified by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the general relativistic shock condition to study the multi - transonic flow for the conical model .",
    "@xcite studied the general relativistic accretion for multi - transonic flow but the shock issues were not dealt in detail . while all the above works dealt with the polytropic accretion , shock transition in general relativistic isothermal flow was discussed in @xcite .",
    "shocked accretion for mhd flows in kerr geometry has also been studied by various authors @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it was realized that it is instructive to incorporate an expression for the flow thickness for flow in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction such that the corresponding flow equation will remain non singular on the horizon .",
    "both the thin accretion disc as well as the quasi - spherical flow structure can be accommodated using such a disc height .",
    "@xcite provided such an expression for the general flow structure . the disc height introduced by @xcite",
    "had further been modified to study the multi - transonic flow structure around kerr black holes in @xcite .",
    "owing to the strong curvature of space time close to the black hole , accreting fluid is expected to manifest extreme behaviour just before plunging into the event horizon .",
    "the spectral signature of this tremendously hot ultra fast matter with its characteristic density and pressure profile is expected to provide the key features of the strong gravity space time to the close proximity of the event horizon .",
    "a detail study of the role of the black hole spin angular momentum in influencing the dynamical features of the transonic matter close to the event horizon is thus very important to perform to understand the salient features of the general relativistic black hole space time , and , in turn , to understand the physical properties of the kerr metric itself . @xcite and",
    "@xcite were the first to make attempt to understand the flow properties close to the black hole by studying the general relativistic optically thin advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) in the kerr metric .",
    "later on , @xcite applied the method of post newtonian asymptotic analysis to investigate the properties of the inner region of adaf to obtain their results that has been argued to be in agreement with the relativistic flow description .",
    "subsequently , @xcite studied the influence of black hole spin in determining the properties of the accretion variables sufficiently close to the event horizon for multi - transonic flow , although the shock conditions were not taken into account in their work .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated that the multi - transonicity can only be realized through the presence of a standing shock since a smooth flow can never make more than one regular sonic transition @xcite .",
    "motivated by the aforementioned issues , in this work we would like to study the behaviour of the low angular momentum multi - transonic shocked accretion extremely close to the black hole event horizon .",
    "the present work differs from all other previous works on general relativistic accretion , including @xcite and @xcite since for the first time in literature , not only a multi - transonic shocked flow has been studied at the close viscinity of the event horizon to understand the role of the black hole spin angular momentum on determining the salient features of such flow , but also a complete description of the linear perturbation analysis has also been provided which ensures the stablity of such accretion solutions .",
    "in addition , a formal analytical description for the general fluid flow in axisymmetric black hole space time has also been provided in our work .    as an obvious extension of @xcite .",
    "we introduce the standing shock by solving the relativistic rankine - hugoniot conditions , and study the behaviour of the post shock flow to the close vicinity of the horizon .",
    "we then compare such results with the hypothetical flow solutions for which the flow would not pass through a shock ( and hence would behave like a mono - transonic flow passing through the saddle type outermost sonic point formed at a large distance from the black hole event horizon ) for the same set of initial boundary conditions describing the flow .",
    "this allows us to understand whether the shock formation phenomena can alter the dynamical and thermodynamic state of matter extremely close to the event horizon and whether such change may show up through the spectral properties of the black hole candidates .    from recent theoretical and observational findings ,",
    "the relevance of the counter rotating accretion in black hole astrophysics is being increasingly evident @xcite .",
    "it is thus instructive to study whether the characteristic features of the terminal values of the accretion variable for the prograde flow differs considerably form that of the retrograde flow . to the best of our knowledge , for the first time in literature",
    ", our work presents the detailed spin dependence of the terminal behaviour of infalling matter for retrograde accretion onto a kerr black hole using the complete general relativistic framework .",
    "we , however , do not explicitly consider the viscous transport of the angular momentum and the specific angular momentum of the accretion flow has been taken to be invariant .",
    "reasonably large radial advective velocity for the slowly rotating sub - keplerian flow implies that the infall time scale is considerably small compared to the viscous time scale for the flow profile considered in this work .",
    "large radial velocities even at larger distances are due to the fact that the angular momentum content of the accreting fluid is relatively low @xcite . the assumption of inviscid flow for the accretion profile under consideration is thus justified from an astrophysical point of view .",
    "such inviscid configuration has also been address by other authors using detail numerical simulation works @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , low angular momentum non self - gravitating axisymmetric inviscid accretion will be considered in our work . to begin with ,",
    "consider a generic ( 3 + 1 ) stationary axisymmetric space - time endowed with two commuting killing fields , within which the the back reactionless three dimensional general relativistic fluid equations will be looked upon . in such a space - time , the combined euler and continuity eqauations take the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the time like fibre bundle ( a tangent vector field in the present context ) defined on the manifold constructed by the family of streamlines .",
    "the normalisation condition corresponding to the velocity vector field @xmath10 is taken to be @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath5 is the speed of propagation of the acoustic perturbation embeded in the accreting fluid and @xmath12 is the local rest mass energy density of the fluid . for a single temperature fluid",
    ", @xmath12 can be replaced by the particle number density .",
    "the space - time considered is a stationary axisymmetric manifold of dimension four endowed with two killing vector fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 so that @xmath15 the locally timelike killing field @xmath13 ( of norm @xmath16 ) is the generator of staionarity whereas the locally spacelike killing field @xmath14 ( of norm @xmath17 ) with closed spacelike integral curves generate the axisymmetry .",
    "it is usually not possible to obtain any orthogonal basis for the space - time of our consideration since @xmath18 for stationry axisymmetric space - time .",
    "we would intend to specify an orthogonal basis using which the space time metric can directly be expressed . to accomplish such task",
    "we first define @xmath19 so that generically @xmath20 .",
    "norm of @xmath21 can thus be expressed as , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is timelike and @xmath24 is positive .",
    "the metric element can now be expressed in the orthogonal bases as follows@xmath25 @xmath26 being the spacelike basis vectors orthogonal to @xmath27 .",
    "for a stationary axisymmetric space - time the hypersurface @xmath28 defines an ergosphere rather than the horizon .",
    "@xmath29 is negativew inside the ergosphere since @xmath13 is spacelike in that region . on the otherhand ,",
    "a compact @xmath30 hypersurface defines a killing horizon ( e.g. a blackhole event horizon in our case ) .",
    "this can be demonstrated by constructing the null geodesic congruence on such a surface .",

    "@xmath37 from eq .   into eq .   provides the expression of @xmath45 .    in this section",

    "it is also requiered that sound speed as well as the rest mass energy density is to be known a priori to find the specific values of @xmath48 . for our particular purpose ,",
    "the axisymmetric space - time metric is of kerr type and @xmath49 , for which , the initial boundary conditions can not be evaluated analytically for barotropic equation of state and for a certain geomatric configuaration of the accreting fluid . @xmath5 and @xmath12 are also unknown a priori .",

    "now it becomes apparent from equations that ,    @xmath395    [ asympf ]    hence substituting these expressions into eqs .",
    ", and one readily obtains that @xmath396 , @xmath397 and @xmath398 at the asymptotic limit .",
    "hence for the first three terms in the trial power series solution for the space dependent part of the perturbation it is evident that @xmath399 for the high frequency regime at the asymptotic solution .",
    "this indicates that @xmath400 or in other word the power series converges even at the outer bounadary of the flow ruling out any divergence of any possible perturbing component of @xmath346 from the solution of eq .   for a particular set of boundary conditions .    in this work , we study how the stationary accretion solutions in the kerr metric behaves close to the black hole hole horizon .",
    "the dependence of such behaviour on the black hole spin is also studied . by employing suitable stability analysis above we",
    "ensure that such stationary solutions ( which constitute a subcategory of the potential flow , in general ) are stable , and hence any spectral profile which might be constructed out of those solutions are reliable , at least upto an astrophysically relevant time scale .",
    "majority of the works on the role of the black hole spin in influencing the accretion dynamics are focused on high angular momentum disk - like flows , with the central role payed by the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . however , sgra * and m87 are the two most preferred candidates for direct imaging of the flow close to the black hole horizon since the angular size of the black hole horizon is by far the largest in these two sources due to the interplay between the black hole mass and the distance to the source is measured by the observer .",
    "the exact value of the angular momentum of the inflowing material for the aforementioned two sources is difficult to estimate , and the current evaluations indicate values ranging from moderate @xcite to considerably low @xcite",
    ".    the present constraints inferred on the unresolved components in these two sources in the mm bands are already very impressive @xcite . in the future vlbi event horizon telescope",
    "will bring us still much closer to the central compact object for these sources @xcite . in order to understand the salient features of these images as well as the properties of the corresponding broad band radiation spectra we need to predict the emissivity distribution and construct the expected black hole silhouettes for various models using the ray tracing techniques as described in @xcite .",
    "sizable amount of work in this direction has been performed for high angular momentum flows and for ion tori ( e.g. @xcite ) . the results given in our present paper paper form a starting point for complementary study for the case of low angular momentum accretion . in our next work ( huang and das , in preparation )",
    ", we plan to perform the black hole shadow imaging corresponding to the low angular momentum axisymmetric accretion as considered in this work .    in our present work",
    "we have studied the radial ion temperature profile as a function of the kerr parameter , as well as the dependence of the corresponding @xmath401 profile on the black hole spin .",
    "our ongoing calculation concentrates on the calculation of the electron temperature from such ion temperature .",
    "knowledge of such electron temperature , along with the density and the velocity profile as calculated in our present work , will then provide us the complete knowledge of the emitted polarized radiation in the millimeter and sub- millimeter band .",
    "we also plan to study the influence of shock formation on the polarized emission of sgra * using our flow model .",
    "findings as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] indicate a consistent asymmetry between the prograde and the retrograde flow as far as the quasi - terminal values are concerned .",
    "the constructed shadow image is also expected to manifest the asymmetry .",
    "we thus expect to propose a novel method to differentiate the co - rotating and counter - rotating flow once we construct the corresponding spectra and the associated shadow images out of the accretion variables as calculated using our flow model .",
    "the observations of sgr a * and m87 by @xcite seem to rule out counter - rotating flow since the images are in both cases much smaller than isco .",
    "however , the argument applies only withing the frame of disk - like accretion .",
    "low angular momentum flow is much less influenced by the position of the isco and the emissivity is more concentrated towards the center as perceived in a spherically symmetric flow .",
    "therefore , the construction of the predicted images in the case of low angular momentum flows requires urgent attention as we believe .",
