    "the visco - elastic behavior , i.e. the frequency dependent viscosity @xmath11 , of concentrated neutral hard sphere colloidal suspensions has been obtained in the benchmark experiments of van der werff et al@xmath8 for volume fractions @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the number density of the colloidal particles of diameter @xmath15 .",
    "the frequency dependence was found to be qualitatively similar to that obtained theoretically by cichocki and felderhof@xmath7 for dilute suspensions from an exact solution of the two particle smoluchowski equation for two brownian particles without hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "an approximate theory for concentrated colloidal suspensions was developed by verberg et al@xmath16 which agreed well with the experimental results of van der werff et al for such suspensions .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic behavior of the ( complex ) viscosity for large frequencies @xmath0 was given correctly as @xmath17 , where @xmath4 is the viscosity of the solvent , @xmath2 an amplitude and @xmath5 a characteristic brownian particle interaction time , the pclet time , defined below .",
    "however , the amplitude @xmath2 was at small @xmath3 a factor two smaller than the exact value obtained by cichocki and felderhof at low densities and it was too high when compared with the experiments of van der werff et al at high densities .",
    "this difference in asymptotic behavior did not affect the good agreement with experiments carried out in the reduced form used by van der werff et al@xmath18 .    in the theory of verberg",
    "et al , @xmath11 was obtained as a sum of two terms : a short time  infinite frequency  contribution @xmath19 on the very short brownian - time scale @xmath20s ) where the brownian particle forgets its initial velocity and a long time contribution , on the very much longer pclet - time scale @xmath21s ) , involving mode - mode coupling contributions associated with two cage - diffusion modes , that describe the diffusion of each colloidal particle out of the cage in which it finds itself in a concentrated colloidal suspension@xmath16 :    @xmath22    for large @xmath0 , the mode - mode coupling contributions @xmath23 reduces to :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the equilibrium radial distribution function @xmath26 at contact , i.e. @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the distance between two hard spheres of diameter @xmath15 and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the stokes - einstein diffusion coefficient    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath32 the temperature of the colloidal suspension .    for low concentrations @xmath33 and @xmath23",
    "reduces to :    @xmath34    while cichocki and felderhof obtain@xmath7 :    @xmath35    the different coefficient in eq.(1.4 ) for the approach to @xmath36 is due to the approximate nature of @xmath37 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to obtain the exact asymptotic behavior of @xmath38 for large @xmath0 for _ all _ @xmath3 studied by van der werff et al@xmath8 , i.e. an extension of cichocki and felderhof s result to high concentrations , as well as its behavior for a soft potential .    in the next section",
    "we will give the basic equations .",
    "in section 3 we will calculate the asymptotic frequency dependent viscosity , for a soft , but very steep potential , starting from the green - kubo expression . in section 4",
    "we will give the result for a hard sphere potential , as the limit of a soft potential .",
    "we will end with a short discussion on the soft potential result .",
    "in order to obtain the asymptotic behavior of @xmath38 for large @xmath0 for concentrated suspensions we start from a general green - kubo expression for the frequency dependent viscosity of a colloidal suspension@xmath39 :    @xmath40    eq.(2.1 ) gives the linear response of the suspension to an applied shear rate @xmath41 with finite frequency @xmath0 and vanishing shear rate amplitude @xmath42 . in eq.(2.1 ) , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the volume of the colloidal suspension , while @xmath45 is the stress - stress auto correlation function defined by :    @xmath46    where the brackets denote a canonical equilibrium ensemble average .",
    "the microscopic stress tensor @xmath47 is given by :    @xmath48    with @xmath49 the position of particle @xmath50 the total force on particle @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 the total potential energy of the colloidal particles and :    @xmath54    the @xmath55-particle smoluchowski operator@xmath56 , the colloidal analogue of the liouville operator for atomic liquids@xmath57 , with @xmath58 the diffusion tensor , incorperating hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "this diffusion tensor determines the velocity imparted to particle @xmath51 by a force acting on particle @xmath59 . in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath60 , the diffusion tensor becomes diagonal and independent of @xmath61 ,    @xmath62    with * 1 * the unit tensor and @xmath63 the kronecker symbol .",
    "however , in concentrated suspensions , where hydrodynamic interactions no longer can be neglected , @xmath58 becomes a function of the positions of all particles , involving therefore many - particle interactions .",
    "the diffusion tensor @xmath58 is directly related to the experimental short time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath10 by@xmath64    @xmath65    for any particle @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath66 is a 3-dimensional unit vector .",
    "@xmath10 reduces in the dilute limit to the stokes - einstein diffusion coefficient @xmath9 ( cf.eq.(2.5 ) ) .",
    "@xmath10 is a purely hydrodynamic quantity , which involves the calculation of the very complicated many - particle interactions , and has been the subject of research for many years , both theoretically@xmath67 and experimentally@xmath68 . by now the behavior of @xmath58 and @xmath10 for intermediate volume fractions up to @xmath69 ,",
    "is fairly well understood theoretically . for higher concentrations to the best of our knowledge",
    "only semi - empirical results exist .",
    "however , in this paper we are particularly interested in the high volume fractions @xmath70 .",
    "therefore we were forced to incorporate hydrodynamic interactions in an approximate ( mean - field - like ) fashion , using eq.(2.6 ) .",
    "this approximation seems justified for high frequencies , where the particle distribution in the suspension is very close to the equilibrium particle distribution , so that the hydrodynamic interactions are described in first order by the hydrodynamic interactions of the suspension at infinite frequency .",
    "the mean - field approximation will be done explicitly in the next section .",
    "for @xmath10 we use at the end a semi - empirical relation which is consistent with experiments and hard sphere computer simulations for all @xmath3 up to @xmath71 .",
    "we will proceed with the calculation of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath11 for large @xmath0 by calculating the stress - stress auto correlation function @xmath45 of eq.(2.2 ) with the microscopic stress tensor of eq.(2.3 ) and the @xmath55-particle smoluchowski operator of eq.(2.4 ) for a soft , but very steep potential .",
    "we restrict ourselves to pairwise additive potentials , i.e. @xmath72 , with @xmath73 the two particle potential and @xmath74 , @xmath75 . we can then write eqs.(2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) , respectively as    @xmath76    and    @xmath77    we determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath11 from eq.(2.1 ) for a soft , but steep pair potential @xmath78 , with @xmath79 the pair interaction energy at @xmath80 and @xmath81 the steepness of the potential .",
    "since the hard sphere potential is the limit for @xmath82 of @xmath83 , one can obtain the hard sphere result , by letting @xmath84 at the end of the calculation .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .    in order to compute @xmath45 for short time , we first expand @xmath45 for @xmath85 in powers of @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we write first eq.(2.2 ) for @xmath45 as    @xmath87    and then calculate @xmath88 , using eq.(3.1 ) for the second @xmath47 within the brackets , i.e. :    @xmath89    for the soft potential @xmath85",
    ".    in this paper we will restrict ourselves to only the leading order in the steepness .",
    "thus , we take into account , for each @xmath14 , only the most divergent terms in @xmath90 .",
    "this implies that , for short times , we can neglect all the contributions of more than two particles to the equilibrium ensemble average @xmath91 , i.e. , we only have to calculate the two - particle contributions , involving the equilibrium radial distribution function @xmath26 .",
    "this , because , relative to the two particle contributions , the @xmath14-particle contributions are of the order @xmath92 , so that they can be neglected in the limit @xmath93 .",
    "thus , for @xmath94 in eq.(3.4 ) we can use eq.(3.2 ) with only @xmath95 , giving    @xmath96^n r_{12,x } \\frac{\\partial v_l(r_{12})}{\\partial r_{1,y } } > _ { eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we used the symmetry of @xmath94 in the particles 1 and 2 , when applied on functions of @xmath97 .",
    "we have introduced the relative diffusion coefficient of two interacting spheres @xmath98 . in the dilute limit for just two particles , distant from all others , the diffusion tensors @xmath99 and @xmath100 are known@xmath101 .    for concentrated suspensions we make a mean - field approximation .",
    "we replace @xmath102 in eq.(3.5 ) by its mean value @xmath103 , which reduces for high frequencies , i.e. , for short times to twice the single particle short time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath10 as given in eq.(2.6)@xmath104 .",
    "thus we write in eq.(3.5 ) ,    @xmath105    consistently with eq.(2.6 ) .    using this approximation and eq.(3.1 ) for @xmath95 ,",
    "i.e. neglecting again all but two - particle contributions , we find straight forwardly :    @xmath106^n r_{12,x } \\frac{\\partial v_l(r_{12})}{\\partial r_{1,y } } > _ { eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath107 , we can shift , to leading order in the steepness , the differential operator @xmath108 through @xmath109 in any product of @xmath109 and @xmath110 or its derivatives .",
    "thus , from eq.(3.7 ) we obtain :    @xmath111^n v_{l}'(r ) > _ { eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .    changing to spherical coordinates , using the definition of the equilibrium radial distribution function @xmath26 for the soft potential @xmath85 and performing the angular integration we find from eqs.(3.3 ) and ( 3.7 ) :    @xmath116    where @xmath117 .",
    "thus we have expressed @xmath45 at large volume fractions @xmath3 and to leading order in the steepness @xmath90 in terms of a one dimensional integral over @xmath28 involving the high density equilibrium radial distribution function @xmath26 for a potential @xmath85 of finite but large @xmath90 and the effective short time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath10 . in the next section",
    "we consider the hard sphere limit @xmath118 of eq.(3.9 ) .",
    "to evaluate eq.(3.9 ) we introduce the function    @xmath119    as discussed in ref.@xcite , @xmath120 is , unlike @xmath26 , a smooth continuous function of @xmath28 for _ all _ @xmath121 and @xmath90 . for hard spheres",
    "@xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the pair correlation function at contact .",
    "writing @xmath125 , using that    @xmath126    and using eq.(4.1 ) , we can write for the stress - stress auto correlation @xmath45 of eq.(3.9 ) in the hard - sphere limit @xmath84 :    @xmath127    here we have defined @xmath128 , the radial part of the two - particle smolochowski operator for a hard - sphere potential in relative coordinates .",
    "this expression can be calculated by a method , similar to that of cichocki and felderhof@xmath7 .",
    "the actual calculation is given in more detail in the appendix , giving :    @xmath129    eq.(4.4 ) leads , with eq.(2.1 ) , to our final result for hard spheres :    @xmath130    with the coefficient of the square root singularity @xmath2 given by :    @xmath131    this result , based on the green - kubo formula for the frequency dependent viscosity @xmath132 of a colloidal suspension consisting of hard spheres with hydrodynamic interactions included , is compared with experiments of van der werff et al@xmath8 in fig.1 .",
    "here we have used for @xmath25 the carnahan - starling approximation@xmath133 @xmath134 for @xmath135 and a one - pole approximation@xmath136 @xmath137 for @xmath138 , with @xmath139 the volume fraction at random close packing .",
    "for @xmath140 we have used beenakker and mazur s expression@xmath141 for @xmath142 and @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "figure 1 clearly shows that in order to obtain agreement with experiment it is neccesary to include hydrodynamic interactions , i.e. , to take into account the diffusion tensor @xmath58 , in the basic n - particle smoluchowski equation . in a mean - field approximation",
    "this leads to the replacement of the stokes - einstein diffusion coefficient @xmath9 by the short time self - diffusion coefficient @xmath10 , a replacement also made by brady@xmath136 .",
    "eqs.(4.5 ) and ( 4.6 ) reduce to the exact expression ( eq.(1.5 ) ) obtained before by cichocki and felderhof for low densities@xmath7 to @xmath145 ( see appendix ) .",
    "we will show in the next section ( eqs.(5.1 ) and ( 5.3 ) ) that the right hand side of eq.(4.4 ) is the leading term of the expansion in powers of @xmath90 of @xmath146 for a soft potential , i.e. , for finite @xmath90 and for frequencies @xmath0 up to @xmath147 .",
    "we note that the large @xmath0-behavior of @xmath148 is typical for hard spheres . for any soft , but steep potential @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "for example , the presence of a lubrication layer causes a change in the relative diffusion of two spheres at very short times , which leads to @xmath151 behavior at very high frequencies , as discussed by cichocki and felderhof@xmath152 and rallison and hinch@xmath153 . to study the transition from the @xmath151-behavior ( for any finite @xmath90 ) to the @xmath154-behavior ( @xmath155 )",
    "we have calculated @xmath156 of eq.(3.9 ) for finite @xmath90 . for finite @xmath90 eq.(3.9 ) can no longer be calculated by a method , similar to that of cichocki and felderhof@xmath7 , described in the appendix , but involves the calculation of the complete eigenvalue problem of the radial part of @xmath157 , the two - particle smoluchowski operator in relative coordinates , for finite @xmath158 .",
    "the result for @xmath156 in eq.(3.9 ) can be written as@xmath159                  consistent with eq.(4.4 ) when @xmath84 . for finite @xmath90 , @xmath168 for frequencies",
    "@xmath0 up to @xmath169 , while for larger @xmath0 , @xmath11 behaves as @xmath151 , as is typical for soft potentials . it might be interesting to see whether such a transition in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath11 can be observed in concentrated colloidal suspensions , where the interaction potential is steep .                                                for low concentrations",
    "( @xmath60 ) , @xmath185 and @xmath186 and @xmath45 reduces to the result of cichocki and felderhof@xmath7 for @xmath187 , for short times .",
    "these authors calculate @xmath187 for hard spheres on the basis of eq.(2.2 ) restricted from the beginning to two hard - sphere particles only , but for all times @xmath86 .",
    "one can show that the angular dependences in eq.(2.2 ) ( i.e. in @xmath188 ) are irrelevant for short times .",
    "thus , for @xmath189 , both approaches are similar , leading to identical results for @xmath45 and @xmath11 .",
