    "optical properties of artificial structures with periodically modulated dielectric constant has been attracting a great deal of interest since pioneering papers refs .   and , where such systems have been first discussed .",
    "periodic modulation of the dielectric function significantly modifies spectral properties of electromagnetic waves . instead of a simple continuous spectrum with a linear dispersion law ,",
    "the electromagnetic spectrum in such structures is characterized by the presence of allowed and forbidden bands similar to electronic band structure of crystals . for this reason ,",
    "the new class of optical materials was dubbed photonic crystals.@xcite changing the spatial distribution of the dielectric constant one can effectively control such fundamental properties as the group velocity of light , the rate of spontaneous emission , etc .",
    "this fact has important repercussion for both fundamental physics and for applications , where it opens up possibilities for new concepts of optical and optoelectronic devices .",
    "modulation of the dielectric function , however , is not the only way to affect light propagation and its interaction with matter .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that closely packed dipole active atoms can become coherently coupled by light , and this coupling significantly changes their emission properties resulting in the so called  super - radiance \" effect . in the original dicke s model@xcite the distance between the atoms was assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength of their emission , but similar effect can also arise if dipole active elements form a one - dimensional periodic lattice with the period coinciding with the emission half - wavelength ( bragg resonance ) .",
    "such an arrangement is possible with a so called optical lattice of cold atoms@xcite and with their semiconductor analogs  bragg multiple quantum well ( mqw ) structures.@xcite the latter are semiconductor heterostructures , in which very thin layers of a narrower band gap semiconductor ( quantum well ) are separated from each other by much thicker layers of a wider band gap semiconductor ( barrier ) in such a way that the period of the structure coincides with the half - wavelength of light emitted by excitons confined in a quantum well ( qw ) . in these systems , excitons play the role of the dipole active excitations , which become radiatively coupled and demonstrate the superradiance effect . if , however , the size ( the number of periods ) in an optical lattice increases , the properties of the system change@xcite .",
    "in particular , the dark modes form two branches of collective excitations , in which light is coupled with the material resonances , and which can be called optical lattice polaritons . at the same time",
    ", the super - radiance mode develops into a stop band , which is a spectral gap between the two polariton branches , characterized by almost complete reflection of a normally incident radiation . the distinction between bragg structures and other arrangements , in which the period of the structure is not in the resonance with radiation emitted by the active elements ,",
    "can , in this case , be described in terms of formation of a significantly ( by orders of magnitude ) enhanced stop band .",
    "there is , however , an important difference between optical lattices of atoms and semiconductor heterostructures . in the latter case ,",
    "the interaction of light with active elements ( excitons ) is accompanied by multiple reflection of light from interfaces between wells and barrier layers caused by difference in their refractive indexes .",
    "thus , in structures like mqws optical lattice effects coexist with photonic crystal - like effects , which results in a number of new and interesting optical properties and opportunities for applications .",
    "such structures , called resonant photonic crystals ( rpc ) , have recently started attracting significant attention.@xcitea general characteristic of this type of structures is the co - existence of dipole active material excitations ( excitons , phonons , plasmons ) described by optical susceptibilities of the resonant type and the periodic modulation of the background dielectric constant .",
    "two most fundamental problems in the focus of current research in this area are concerned with the effects of the interplay between resonances and spatial non - uniformity of the dielectric function on the band structure of these systems and their optical spectra .",
    "while these two questions are interconnected , they have to be recognized as two separate problems , one dealing with normal modes of closed ( or infinite ) systems and their dispersion laws and the other with the interaction of an internal radiation with a finite size structure .",
    "the main interest of studies in this field is a spectral region in the vicinity of the resonant frequency , where the interplay effects play the most important role .",
    "a theoretical description of rpc s in this spectral region is a challenging problem and its complete solution has not yet been obtained even for a simplest case of one - dimensional structures , such as mqws .",
    "of course , it is always possible to carry out numerical calculations of the optical spectra and the dispersion laws , which are particularly easy in one - dimensional case .",
    "however purely numerical approach does not provide a real understanding of physics of these structures .",
    "therefore , it is very important to be able to carry out analytical analysis , which would not only provide a better understanding of physical processes taking place in these structures , but would also be instrumental in designing structures with pre - determined properties , which is crucial for their possible applications .",
    "different aspects of this problem have been , of course , considered in a number of previous publications . in particular , in ref .",
    "the necessity of a modification of the bragg resonance ( super - radiance ) condition for one - dimensional resonant photonic crystals compared to the case of optical lattice structures was shown .",
    "later , this result was confirmed@xcite and an exact bragg condition in such structures was found for the particular case of normal propagation of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "it was also noted in ref .   that , when the resonance condition is met , the spectral gap between the polariton branches becomes wider than in the case of a passive photonic crystal characterized by the same modulation of the dielectric function or of an optical lattice with the same strength of radiative coupling between the active elements . in the case of structures of higher ( 2 or 3 ) dimensions ,",
    "no analytical results are available yet , but one can note recent numerical calculations presented in refs .   and , where it was also found that the resonances may enhance polariton related band gaps compared to a purely passive photonic crystal with the same spatial distribution of the dielectric constant .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this enhancement of the band gap in rpc structures is not a trivial effect . in order to illustrate this point",
    "we can mention another , in a certain sense , opposite effect , which also results from the interplay between the resonances and periodic inhomogeneities of the dielectric function .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that there always exists a frequency where the reflection coefficient of the incident light vanishes due to the destructive interference between the two channels of interaction between light and the structure .",
    "these examples show the richness of the optical properties of even one - dimensional resonant photonic crystals . in order to achieve a complete understanding of relationships between optical and geometrical characteristics of these structures",
    ", one needs a general analytical method , which could be applied to a variety of rpcs independently of a particular spatial dependence of their dielectric function . in our previous paper , ref .",
    ", such a method was developed for studying _ reflection , transmission , and absorption spectra _ of one - dimensional rpc structures .",
    "the present paper presents a general analytical approach to calculating the _ band structure _ of these materials .",
    "this method allows one to analyze dispersion laws of one - dimensional rpcs with an arbitrary form of the periodic modulation of the dielectric function , propagation angle of the electromagnetic wave and its polarization state .",
    "this method naturally incorporates resonant excitations of the medium into the theory . for concreteness",

    "derivation_transfer_matrix ] and , particulary , in subsection  [ sec : structure_transfer_matrices ] we show that by choosing an appropriate basis for representing transfer matrices one can significantly simplify the analysis of the band structure and dispersion laws of electromagnetic excitations in the structures under consideration . in sections",
    "iv and v we illustrate the power of the approach by applying it to a number of examples , some of which deal with already well studied situations ( passive one - dimensional photonic crystals , optical lattices , mqws with a piece - wise spatial dependence of the dielectric function ) , while the others demonstrate the possibilities of our approach in obtaining results that could not have been obtained by other methods .",

    "( [ eq : complex_gap_width ] ) , the same .",

    "this modification has a different character than in structures with a simple cell .",
    "the mean value of the exciton frequencies stays at the center of the forbidden gap and only the difference between the frequencies must be corrected to take into account the mismatch .",
    "the resultant gap is , similar to the case of simple cell , again the pythagorean sum of the photonic and the excitonic contributions .",
    "we considered the band structure associated with normal excitations of one - dimensional resonant photonic crystals using as a particular example the exciton polaritons multiple quantum well structures .",
    "properties of normal modes of such structures are determined by the interplay of two mechanisms : the interaction of light with internal resonances of constituting materials , such as excitons in mqw case , and multiple reflection of light due to periodic spatial modulation of the index of refraction of the structure . the necessity to take into account both mechanisms of the light - matter interaction in these structures on equal footing",
    "makes the analytical description of their properties more complicated than in the case of regular passive photonic crystals . in this paper",
    "we developed a powerful method of analyzing band structure and dispersive properties of such structures , which allowed us to obtain analytical solutions for problems that could not be solved by other approaches .",
    "this method is based on two key features .",
    "first , we construct transfer matrices using solutions of the appropriate cauchy ( rather than boundary value ) problems as a basis .",
    "this makes calculations of the transfer matrices more convenient since it allows for avoiding difficult questions about eigenmodes of the system under consideration .",
    "second , we use a special representation of the transfer matrix valid for structures with an elementary cell possessing a mirror symmetry .",
    "this representation automatically yields the dispersion equation of normal modes in a factorized form , which drastically simplifies the analysis of the spectrum .",
    "in particular , using this representation we were able to analyze dispersion properties of certain type of resonant photonic crystals with complex elementary cells .",
    "we also believe that besides situations explicitly considered in the paper , the suggested method allows for effective treatment of other problems such as exciton luminescence from mqw photonic crystals , or for analysis of more complicated systems , e.g. quantum graphs.@xcite an important benefit of the developed approach consists also in the fact that polarization and angular dependencies of the elements of transfer matrices appear in this approach only via respective fresnel coefficients .",
    "this enabled us to obtain band structures of modes of both @xmath18- and @xmath19-polarizations in mqw based photonic crystals from essentially the same dispersion equation and easily analyze their angular dependencies .",
    "we illustrated the developed method by applying it to a number of problems , some of which were considered previously in the framework of other approaches , while others were analyzed in this paper for the first time . in particular , we considered polariton spectrum in several systems : mqw structures with the mismatch of the indices of refraction of the barriers and wells materials , mqw with an arbitrary periodic modulation of the dielectric function , and mqw with a complex elementary cell consisting of two equidistant qws characterized by different exciton frequencies .",
    "we showed that in all these cases one can construct a structure , in which multiple photon and polariton bands can be collapsed in just two polariton branches separated by an anomalously broad stop band .",
    "such a band structure is characteristic of so called bragg structures , which in the case of mqws were studied in a number of previous publications .",
    "we showed here that in the case of rpcs with a simple elementary cell the condition for formation of such a spectrum can be formulated as a requirement for the exciton frequency to coincide with one of the edges of the respective passive photonic crystal .",
    "formulated in this form this condition demonstrates a direct connection with earlier formulations of the bragg resonance in mqw structures without the refractive index contrast . in the case of crystals with complex elementary cells , we showed that our method allows for taking into account the mismatch of the refractive indices between different elements of the structure and found the generalized bragg conditions for this system as well .",
    "in the last case , this condition consists of two equations : one relating the period of the structure to the exciton frequencies of the constituent elements and the other specifying a relation between those frequencies .",
    "one of the surprising results is that for all these structures the width of the polariton band gap in the case of the bragg resonance can be presented in the form of a pythagorean sum of the photonic and the excitonic contributions , @xmath374 .",
    "the excitonic contribution in the presence of the refractive index modulation , however , is modified compared to the case of simple optical lattices . it is interesting that this modification can be presented in the form of a ratio of the electric field energy concentrated inside qw to the the total energy stored in the entire elementary cell of the structure .",
    "the work has been supported by afosr grant f49620 - 02 - 1 - 0305 .",
    "the transfer matrix technique has been reviewed in a number of publications . here",
    ", however , we use this technique in a somewhat unusual form .",
    "therefore , we find it useful to recall some important results . while the general idea of the transfer matrix establishing a linear connection between values of a function representing a solution of a linear differential equation at two different values of the argument is inherent to all formulations , the explicit form of the transfer matrix and its properties depend upon a choice of the representation of the matrix . as a basic representation one often chooses a @xmath21 matrix operating on a two - dimensional vector , whose components are the value of a function , which represents a solution at a given point , and its derivative .",
    "the formal reason for this choice is the fact that a linear equation of a second order can always be naturally reformulated as a system of two first order equations for the function and its derivative : @xmath375    another approach to constructing transfer matrices is more convenient for problems involving scattering of waves .",
    "this problem is most naturally described by specifying an amplitude of an incident wave and relating to it amplitudes of transmitted and reflected waves . in this approach ,",
    "the field is sought in the form @xmath376 at the one side of the system , and in the form @xmath377 at the the other side .",

    "for instance , a basis of a pair of linearly independent functions can be most naturally related to solutions of the cauchy problem for the respective differential equation . such a basis is easy to find but it is inconvenient for the solution of scattering problems .",
    "the fact that , generally , it is not related to @xmath391 by a similarity transformation [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation_field_functions ] ) ] makes it also difficult to consider the spectral problems using this basis .",
    "indeed , the knowledge of the transfer matrix itself is not sufficient for solving this problem , and one has to separately consider a boundary value problem for amplitudes @xmath392 . on the contrary ,",
    "the basis of plane waves is the most suitable for solving this particular problem since the transfer matrix itself contains all needed information . in this basis , the difficulty of having to solve the boundary value problem is moved to the process of finding the transfer matrix itself .",
