    "many technological applications of graphene require an electronic gap to construct switching devices .",
    "a first step in this direction has been achieved by recent experiments with hydrogenated graphene @xcite and gated bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "these experiments take advantage of the fact that the breaking of a discrete symmetry of the lattice system opens a gap in the elctronic spectrum at the fermi energy .",
    "a symmetry - breaking potential ( sbp ) is a staggered potential in the case of a monolayer , which breaks the sublattice symmetry of the honeycomb lattice , or a gate potential that distinguishes between the two layers in the case of bilayer graphene , where the latter breaks the symmetry between the layers . with this opportunity ,",
    "one enters a new field , where one can switch between conducting and insulating regimes of a two - dimensional material , either by a chemical process ( e.g. oxidation or hydrogenation ) or by applying an external electric field @xcite .    the opening of a _ uniform _ gap destroys the metallic state immediately .",
    "thus the conductivity of the material would drop from a finite value of order @xmath0 directly to zero . in a realistic system , however , the gap may not be uniform after turning on the sbp .",
    "this means that only locally the material becomes insulating , whereas in other regions of the sample it is still metallic .",
    "the situation can be compared with a classical random network of broken and unbroken bonds .",
    "the conductivity of such a network is nonzero as long as there is a percolating cluster of unbroken bonds .",
    "in such a system the transition from conducting to insulting behavior is presumably a second order percolation transition @xcite .",
    "disorder in mono- and bilayer graphene has been the subject of a number of recent numerical studies @xcite and analytic calculations @xcite .",
    "the results can be summarized by the statement that chiral - symmetry preserving disorder provides delocalized states whereas a chiral - symmetry breaking scalar potential disorder leads to anderson localization , even at the np .",
    "the breaks the chiral symmetry but still allows for delocalized states at the np @xcite .",
    "in contrast to chiral - symmetry preserving disorder , a random sbp reduces the minimal conductivity and can even lead to an insulating behavior .    in this article",
    "an approach will be employed that eliminates a part of the complexity of the tight - binding model by focusing on continuous symmetries and corresponding spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this allows us to identify a massless mode in the system with a randomly fluctuating sbp . using a loop expansion we study the scaling behavior of the model and derive a diffusion propagator for the asymptotic behavior on large scales .",
    "our result implies a relation between the average two - particle green s function and the product two average one - particle green s functions in self - consistent born approximation .",
    "this is similar to the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation , a self - consistent equation for the average two - particle green s function ( cooperon ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the latter we are also able to control the scaling behavior of all higher order terms in the loop expansion .",
    "our approach provides also information about the effect of symmetry - breaking terms .",
    "it turns out that the latter create a finite length scale @xmath1 , such that diffusion breaks down for length scales @xmath2 larger than @xmath1 .",
    "another reason for the breakdown of diffusion is a vanishing spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "this happens when the average value of the sbp exceeds a critical value . in this case",
