    "quantum dots ( qds ) are semiconductor nanostructures that combine aspects typical for atomic systems , in particular a discrete energy spectrum , with the technologically well developed and well controllable semiconductor material system .",
    "this compatibility with existing technologies makes qds attractive candidates for a wide range of applications ranging from optoelectronic devices like qd lasers @xcite , where the target is an improved performance compared to other laser structures , up to new applications in the fields of quantum cryptography or quantum information processing , where the presence of discrete energy levels is mandatory .",
    "examples of such quantum applications are single - photon sources @xcite , sources of entangled photon pairs @xcite , and qubit devices or quantum gates @xcite .",
    "the functionality of all these latter applications relies on the preparation of a well - defined quantum state .",
    "the generation of single photons or entangled photon pairs is based on the radiative recombination starting from the exciton or the biexciton state . therefore , for a highly efficient photon generation a high - fidelity preparation of the qd in the exciton or biexciton state is required . for the realization of a qubit or a quantum gate in addition arbitrary superposition states have to be prepared with high fidelity .    in an ideal",
    "optically driven two- or few - level system a preparation of arbitrary quantum states provides no conceptual difficulty and can be achieved , e.g. , by using various coherent control techniques @xcite .",
    "a qd , however , due to its embedding in a semiconductor matrix and the resulting non - negligible coupling to the phonons of the crystal lattice , is not an ideal few - level system .",
    "phonons lead to a dephasing of coherences and to relaxation processes between different electronic states .",
    "this may prohibit some of the preparation schemes or at least strongly limit the range of excitation parameters where a high - fidelity state preparation is possible .",
    "therefore , a detailed knowledge of the role of phonons in the various excitation schemes is necessary to select the best scheme and to optimize its performance .    in this review",
    "we will give an overview of the role of phonons in different state preparation schemes using optical excitation of a single qd .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the phonon influence on coherent excitation schemes based on resonant excitation or excitation by chirped laser pulses , where phonons typically give rise to unwanted dephasing or relaxation effects and therefore introduce limitations to the otherwise ideal schemes .",
    "in contrast to these coherent schemes , phonons may also be actively used in state preparation by employing an excitation with detuned pulses giving rise to a phonon - assisted exciton or biexciton generation .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the model for the description of the electronic structure of the qd as well as its coupling to light and phonons is introduced .",
    "the relevant physics and the different theoretical approaches which have been used to model the dynamics of the optically driven qd are briefly explained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : schemes ] the three basically different state preparation schemes are described .",
    "experimental and theoretical results that have been obtained with these schemes are discussed in particular in view of the role of the phonons for the state preparation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we compare the three schemes and discuss their respective advantages , drawbacks , and limitations .",
    "the review then finishes with some concluding remarks .",
    "in qds the electronic motion is confined in all three directions on a nanometer scale @xcite .",
    "therefore , the corresponding electronic spectra possess a discrete part similar to what is found for atoms .",
    "the target states of the preparation schemes to be discussed in this review are typically well separated in energy from all other electronic states , which allows for a selective excitation of these states .",
    "this condition is best fulfilled for strongly confined dots .",
    "for the theory , this implies that one can concentrate on a rather limited electronic subspace spanned by states @xmath0 with discrete energies @xmath1 such that the electronic hamiltonian reads : @xmath2 most often discussed is the case , where the valence band states are formed from heavy - hole states with angular momentum projections @xmath3 while the conduction band states have @xmath4 .",
    "for strongly confined dots , one can concentrate on the lowest lying electron and hole states . in this review",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of charge - neutral qds , which implies that one has to consider a basis of four electronic states , namely the ground state @xmath5 ( i.e. , the state without electron - hole pairs ) , two bright single exciton states @xmath6 corresponding to single electron - hole pairs with total angular momenta @xmath7 and the biexciton state @xmath8 , where two electron - hole pairs are confined in the dot .",
    "two further exciton states with angular momenta @xmath9 can be formed from the lowest single particle states , which are usually referred to as dark excitons as they can not be excited directly by the laser field .",
    "a relaxation into these dark states requires spin flip processes that take place on a time scale of typically longer than a nanosecond @xcite or relaxation from energetically higher excited states @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are not relevant for state preparation schemes occurring on a time scale of at most a few tens of picoseconds and will not be considered in this review .",
    "in most real qds the two bright exciton states exhibit an additional coupling due to the long - range exchange interaction : @xmath10 a finite @xmath11 entails a splitting of the exciton energies by @xmath12 and the exciton eigenstates are then given by the linearly polarized single exciton states : @xmath13  @xmath14ev @xcite . for schemes that are targeted at the preparation of the biexciton state , in order to subsequently initiate a decay cascade that creates entangled photon pairs @xcite it is a necessary precondition to ideally have a vanishing exchange splitting @xcite .",
    "otherwise , a kind of which - path information would be introduced in the decay that prevents a high degree of entanglement @xcite .",
    "apart from selecting qds that happen to exhibit almost zero splitting @xcite , also specially designed growth @xcite or annealing @xcite techniques have been developed for that purpose .",
    "alternatively , one can use dots with high symmetry such as , e.g. , self - organized in(ga)as / gaas qds grown on ( 111 ) substrate which should ideally have no exchange splitting @xcite , or apply strategies to actively suppress the splitting , such as , e.g. , the ac - stark tuning @xcite or application of strain or external electric and/or magnetic fields @xcite . furthermore , all preparation schemes aim at being as fast as possible without degrading other properties such as the robustness or the spectral selectivity of the scheme . with the schemes discussed in this review",
    "the preparation is typically completed after about @xmath15  ps .",
    "together with the fact that preparation schemes are preferably executed with dots having a rather small exchange splitting , it is justified to ignore the impact of the exchange interaction on the time scale required for the preparation .",
    "therefore , in the following we shall identify the relevant dot eigenstates with the states : @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 , i.e. , we have two energetically degenerate single exciton states with energy @xmath16 . when the energy of the ground state is set to zero , the energy of the biexciton state @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the biexciton binding energy .",

    "accounting for the usual dipole selection rules between the dot basis states , the dipole interaction matrix @xmath25 reads : @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 . here",
    ", @xmath29 is the circularly @xmath30 polarized component of the laser field which drives the dipole transitions between the ground state @xmath5 and the single exciton states @xmath6 as well as from the single exciton states @xmath31 to the biexciton state @xmath8 , @xmath32 denotes the corresponding dipole matrix element , @xmath33 is the central frequency of the laser , and @xmath34 is the driving amplitude of the corresponding transition , which is defined in such a way that for a resonant cw excitation its modulus corresponds to the rabi frequency .",
    "this coupling scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : level ] .",
    "in many studies , this model is further reduced to an electronic two - level system ( tls ) by considering an excitation by light with a single circular polarization . for this choice of excitation conditions ,",
    "two of the four electronic states introduced above are decoupled from the dynamics and the electronic system is reduced to the tls formed by the ground state @xmath5 and the single exciton state that we shall denote by @xmath35 driven by a light field with the amplitude @xmath36 .    for laser pulse envelopes that are varying sufficiently slowly in time , the dressed state basis for the electronic state space is a natural choice , which also helps to highlight the physics of some of the preparation schemes discussed in sec .  [ sec : schemes ] .",
    "these dressed states are defined as the instantaneous eigenstates of the light - matter hamiltonian @xmath37 in the frame rotating with the laser frequency . the simplest case is constituted by the tls , where the dressed states @xmath38 are given by : @xmath39 , \\label{eq : dressed - states}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the detuning between the laser frequency and the transition frequency of the dot , and @xmath41 are normalization factors .",
    "the energies of the dressed states are @xmath42 as can be seen from these formulas , the dressed states depend on the detuning @xmath40 and the strength @xmath36 of the optical driving . for a four - level exciton - biexciton system , simple formulas for the dressed states arise in the special case of a vanishing biexciton binding energy @xmath19 and resonant driving @xcite . for finite @xmath19 and/or off - resonant driving analytical expressions can still be derived , but they are quite involved and not very instructive .    due to their embedding in a solid - state environment , qds can not be treated as isolated systems .",
    "here , most important is the coupling to phonons . for strongly confined dots , on short time",
    "scales , the coupling of excitons to acoustic phonons via the pure dephasing mechanism @xcite has been identified as typically being the dominant source of decoherence @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads : @xmath43 the operator @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) creates ( annihilates ) an acoustic phonon in a mode labeled by @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the corresponding phonon energy . in this review",
    "we will mainly concentrate on strongly confined self - assembled ingaas or gaas qds , where the lattice properties in- and outside the dot are similar .",
    "therefore , the phonon modes can be approximated by bulk modes , where the label @xmath46 denotes the phonon wave vector .",
    "furthermore , for strongly confined dots , the excitonic and biexcitonic wave functions approximately factorize into products of single particle electron and hole wave functions , which implies that the phonon coupling constants are of the form : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 represents the number of excitons present in the state @xmath0 and @xmath50 is the exciton - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath50 depends on the specific coupling mechanism . for typical ingaas or gaas dots ,",
    "as discussed mostly in this review , the deformation potential coupling to longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons is by far the strongest , while for strongly polar materials like gan or qds with spatially strongly separated electron and hole wave functions , the piezoelectric coupling to both longitudinal and transverse phonons may become dominant @xcite .",
    "the carriers in the qd also interact with optical phonons , e.g. , via the frhlich interaction @xcite , which under certain conditions can also contribute to the generation of biexcitons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to acoustic phonons , optical phonons , in particular those which are efficiently coupled to the electrons and holes in a qd , can typically be taken to be dispersionless .",
    "because of their essentially discrete spectrum , the interaction with optical phonons does not give rise to dephasing , instead it leads to an oscillatory contribution to the dynamics of the polarization visible as discrete sideband in the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the interaction strength of the energetically well separated optical phonons compared to acoustic phonons is typically rather small and except for very short pulse excitations they are usually out of the spectral range of excitation .",
    "therefore , we will focus on the acoustic phonons in the remainder of this review .",
    "explicit expressions for all commonly used carrier - phonon coupling schemes for qds can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "phonon spectral density for different localization lengths of the qd wave functions . , width=264 ]    most important in the context of state preparation is the influence of the phonon degrees of freedom on the electronic dynamics .",
    "the latter is determined by the phonon spectral density @xmath51 , which is defined by : @xmath52 for qds with a harmonic confinement potential in which the carriers are coupled to la phonons via the deformation potential the phonon spectral density is well approximated by @xcite : @xmath53 with a strength @xmath54 and a cut - off frequency @xmath55 determined by the size of the qd . for a spherical qd with equal confinement lengths @xmath56 for electrons and holes this formula is exact and the parameters are given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the deformation potentials of electrons and holes , @xmath59 is the crystal density , and @xmath60 is the longitudinal sound velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectraldensity ] shows @xmath51 for three different dot sizes and gaas parameters .",
    "it is seen that @xmath51 is maximal at a finite phonon frequency , which is larger for smaller dots and typically of the order of a few mev .",
    "for small frequencies the spectral density scales according to @xmath61 .",
    "such a power - law behavior with an exponent @xmath62 is referred to as superohmic coupling @xcite .",
    "the smooth phonon spectral density of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectraldensity ] is typical for the interaction of excitons or biexcitons in a single qd with bulk acoustic phonon modes , where the size of the qd is the only characteristic length scale .",
    "additional structures in the spectral density appear as soon as other characteristic length scales are present in the system .",
    "phonon couplings for various types of qd structures with more than one length scale have been discussed in the literature , such as qds with different confinement lengths of electrons and holes @xcite or with different aspect ratios @xcite , strong variations of the acoustic properties at the boundary of the qd @xcite , a qd placed close to a surface @xcite , in free - standing slab @xcite or in a quantum wire @xcite , or a pair of qds at a given distance @xcite .",
    "the physics described by the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hel ] ) , ( [ eq : hdip ] ) , and ( [ eq : hph ] ) is most easily understood by first concentrating on two simple limiting cases : ( i ) vanishing exciton - phonon coupling , i.e. , @xmath63 , and ( ii ) no optical driving , i.e. , @xmath64 . in the first case",
    ", the dynamics resulting from the remaining model reduces to the well - known optical bloch equations for electronic two- or four - level systems without relaxation @xcite . in general",
    ", the laser driving leads to a coherent superposition of the discrete dot states , which typically implies for the corresponding occupations an oscillatory behavior known as rabi oscillations .",
    "the frequency of these oscillations depends on the characteristics of the pulse . for the simplest case of a tls driven by a monochromatic laser field with constant amplitude @xmath36",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath65 is given by @xcite : @xmath66 in the dressed state picture these oscillations correspond to a coherent superposition of the two dressed states resulting in quantum beats oscillating with the difference frequency @xmath67 .",
    "most important for the discussion of this review , exciton or biexciton states are reached by the coherent bloch - type dynamics as pure states only for special excitation conditions .",
    "for example , in the case of a tls the exciton can only be prepared as a pure state for resonant excitation , i.e. , for @xmath68 and distinguished values of the pulse area @xmath69 , that equal odd multiples of @xmath70 . here",
    ", the pulse area is given by : @xmath71 the influence of phonons on the state preparation using resonant rabi oscillations is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : resonant ] .    in the second limiting case",
    "the model reduces to the so called _ independent boson model _ which is known to be analytically solvable @xcite .",
    "as the independent boson model represents a pure dephasing mechanism , i.e. , there is no coupling between different electronic states , the electronic occupations stay constant in the course of time .",
    "however , the carrier - phonon coupling in the independent boson model mixes electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the excited states and thus gives rise to a polaronic character to the eigenstates of the system .",
    "when both , the carrier - light and the carrier - phonon coupling are present , the interplay of both interaction mechanisms leads to a variety of dynamical features not found in the limiting cases , such as phonon - assisted optical generation processes or phonon - induced modifications of rabi oscillations , as will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : schemes ] .",
    "other interaction mechanisms than the coupling to acoustic phonons typically lead to relaxation channels that , at least at sufficiently low temperatures , act on longer time scales than those considered here for preparation purposes . as an example",
    ", we mention the radiative decay , that takes place on a time scale of hundreds of picoseconds up to nanoseconds @xcite .    for some applications ,",
    "it is favorable to place the qd in a microcavity @xcite , where the dot interacts with confined photon modes .",
    "also for dots in cavities phonons can play a decisive role , e.g. , for the dephasing @xcite , the photon statistics @xcite , the indistinguishability of photons @xcite as well as for providing a dot - cavity coupling in the case of non - resonant qd and cavity modes where phenomena like off - resonant cavity feeding have been found @xcite .",
    "although such systems are not at the focus of the present review , we note in passing that in this case , additional relaxation mechanisms , in particular cavity losses , may become of importance .    for more elaborate applications in quantum information technology",
    "the question of upscaling arises .",
    "this means that systems consisting of more than a single qd have to be considered .",
    "like in the case of a qd in a microcavity , also here new phonon - related aspects come into play .",
    "a detailed discussion of such systems is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "however , let us briefly discuss some of these new aspects . the next step in the upscaling is an extension to double qd systems . if the qds are sufficiently close to each other a tunnel coupling between the electron and/or hole states of the individual qds may arise leading to the appearance of delocalized states . because of the similarity of this states with bonding or antibonding states these structures",
    "are also named qd molecules .",
    "this coupling , which can be controlled to a large degree by an external electric field , has been the subject of a large amount of work over the past years investigating both excitonic @xcite and biexcitonic transitions @xcite . in particular close to a resonance between spatially direct and indirect exciton states phonon - induced transitions",
    "can be strongly enhanced @xcite , which can also be interpreted as phonon - assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "the formation of a molecular polaron can give rise to a phonon - induced optical transparency @xcite .",
    "even if the distance between the qds is larger such that tunneling processes are negligible , the qds can still be coupled via the coulomb interaction which leads to an excitation transfer , often referred to as frster coupling . like the tunneling , this transfer is also affected by phonons @xcite .",
    "phonon wave packets emitted from one qd can modulate the optical response of a second qd @xcite .",
    "phonons in general also give rise to the decay of entanglement between excitons in two qds @xcite , which is an important aspect in quantum computation .",
    "apart from its relevance for the laser - driven qd dynamics , the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hel ] ) , ( [ eq : hdip ] ) , and ( [ eq : hph ] ) is a prototype of a quantum dissipative system @xcite and thus also serves as a test ground for different theoretical methods .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that a wealth of theoretical approaches has been actively used for exploring the resulting dynamics . despite of the simplicity of the electronic structure ,",
    "the model in fact represents a genuine many - particle system due to the coupling to a continuum of acoustic phonon modes and an unlimited occupation number of each mode . for an arbitrary laser driving no analytical solution of the model",
    "is known .    only in the limiting case of ultrashort excitations exact analytical solutions can be obtained , because in this limit the influence of the phonons on the excitonic system during the presence of the pulse is negligible .",
    "this is a result of the high - frequency cut - off in the phonon spectral density [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : phonon - spect - anal ] ) ] , which leads to a decoupling at times @xmath72 . closed form results for an arbitrary sequence of ultrashort excitations have been derived using a generating functions formalism @xcite . for preparation purposes , on the one hand , a short preparation time is desired . however",
    ", ultrashort excitations strongly restrict the available preparation schemes such that essentially only the traditional rabi flopping strategy , as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : resonant ] , can be realized .",
    "other schemes that turn out to be advantageous for certain purposes ( cf .",
    "[ sec : chirp ] and [ sec : detuned ] ) require longer pulse durations . for such excitations , one has to rely on numerical methods .",
    "most often , these methods fully account for the dot - light coupling but treat the exciton - phonon interaction within further approximations .",
    "examples of such approaches are the time - convolutionless approach @xcite , the correlation expansion @xcite , different types of master equations @xcite or time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite . for the hamiltonian dynamics within the model established by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hel ] ) , ( [ eq : hdip ] ) and ( [ eq : hph ] ) , also a numerically complete treatment without any further approximations to the light - matter or the carrier - phonon coupling has been implemented using a real - time path - integral approach @xcite . taking these numerically complete solutions as a benchmark , direct comparisons have been performed for the correlation expansion @xcite , the time - convolutionless formulation @xcite , and master equation @xcite approaches .",
    "these comparisons revealed that for parameters typical for state preparation protocols , i.e. , sufficiently low temperatures , weak carrier - phonon couplings and not too long times , the correlation expansion , the time - convolutionless formulation as well as advanced master equation approaches essentially give the same results . a direct comparison of the correlation expansion and perturbation theory revealed that the latter fails much earlier than the other approaches @xcite , which is of course not unexpected .",
    "modulus square of the polarization as a function of time after resonant excitation of a qd with an ultrashort pulse , a @xmath73  fs pulse and a @xmath74  ps pulse .",
    "all pulses have a pulse area @xmath75.,width=264 ]    a characteristic feature of the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hel ] ) , ( [ eq : hdip ] ) , and ( [ eq : hph ] ) is the fact that in the basis of the electronic states @xmath0 the phonons only exhibit a diagonal coupling , i.e. , they do not give rise to transitions between different states .",
    "thus , after an optical excitation  when the light pulse has gone  the occupations of the states remain constant .",
    "however , the optical polarization , describing the coherence between the optically coupled states , exhibits an initial decay on a picosecond time scale .",
    "this reflects the pure dephasing nature of the model . as an example , the black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarization ] displays the time evolution of the modulus square of the optical polarization of a two - level dot generated by an ultrafast laser pulse with a pulse area @xmath76 . like in an ideal tls , an initial value of @xmath77 is reached followed by a decay which is not only non - exponential but also only partial , i.e. , the polarization approaches a temperature - dependent finite value at long times .",
    "the origin of this behavior as well as the dependence on the duration of the exciting pulse will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : superposition ] .",
    "obviously , such a non - exponential and incomplete decay of the polarization , which in the spectral domain corresponds to strongly non - lorentzian line shapes of the absorption or luminescence spectra @xcite , can not be captured by a simple decay rate for the polarization .",
    "in fact , a naive calculation of phonon - induced relaxation rates according to fermi s golden rule would give a zero result in this case , because the energies of the initial and final electronic state are the same and the phonon spectral density @xmath51 is zero at @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the polarization decay represents a genuine non - markovian dynamics .",
    "we note in passing , that the non - exponential decay towards a finite value is special for the superohmic coupling .",
    "in fact , in the subohmic case an exponential decay is found even when @xmath51 still approaches zero for @xmath79 @xcite .    in view of these features , it may at first seem surprising , that even rather simple markovian master equation approaches can , under certain circumstances , well reproduce experimental observations such as the damping of rabi oscillations . here",
    ", it should be noted that provided the laser envelope is slowly varying in time and the carrier - phonon coupling is not too strong , the dressed states become stable quasiparticles . as the light - matter interaction is already accounted for in the definition of the dressed states , the energy of the incoming photons is included in the corresponding energies .",
    "therefore , the splitting between the dressed state energies is determined by the rabi frequency which , for near resonant excitation is typically of the order of a few mev , i.e. , of the order of typical acoustic phonon energies .",
    "therefore , the phonon coupling can now induce real transitions between the dressed states which can be described by a transition rate .",
    "consequently , for moderate carrier phonon coupling strengths the phonons essentially lead to a thermalization dynamics in the dressed state basis @xcite which is often well represented by a markovian rate equation . a more detailed analysis based on master equations accounting for the phonon - induced memory",
    "reveals that the simple markovian treatment comes to its limit , e.g. , when phonon - induced renormalizations of the rabi frequency become important : for stronger carrier - phonon coupling the stable quasiparticles assume a polaronic character , which can be used to formulate more advanced master equation approaches that rely on polaron transformations @xcite .",
    "the state preparation of a qd typically aims at exciting the qd from its ground state , i.e. , when no exciton is present , into a specific final state , e.g. , a single exciton state , the biexciton state or a well - defined superposition state . in this section",
    "we will discuss three basically different optical control schemes and focus on the influence of the phonons on the state preparation .",
    "the most common excitation scheme relies on the coherent manipulation of the few - level system by resonant laser pulses .",
    "the pulses induce rabi oscillations in the carrier system and drive the qd into a final state , which strongly depends on the pulse and material parameters such as pulse shape , pulse duration and dipole coupling matrix elements .",
    "the second scheme uses chirped pulses where the frequency sweeps over the resonance frequency of the qd starting either below or above the resonance . here",
    "the excitation mechanism is an adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) from the ground state to the exciton or biexciton state which , as soon as the adiabaticity condition is reached , only weakly depends on the exact pulse parameters like the pulse area or the chirp rate .",
    "both these schemes have in common that they work perfectly in the case of an isolated few - level system .",
    "phonons deteriorate the controllability and therefore the study of the influence of phonons is mainly directed towards finding parameter ranges where this influence is of minor importance .",
    "in contrast to these two coherent schemes , the third excitation scheme is based on incoherent phonon - induced transitions to prepare the exciton or biexciton state by an excitation with a detuned laser pulse .",
    "this scheme therefore relies on the carrier - phonon interaction and works even better for stronger couplings . in the present section we will describe these schemes and summarize the experimental and theoretical work that has been performed in these fields .",
    "when a qd modeled as an ideal tls is excited resonantly , i.e. , by monochromatic light with the frequency @xmath80 , the occupations of the two states , here the ground and the exciton state , oscillate between zero and one as a function of time .",
    "these are the well - known _ rabi oscillations _ , which were first described for spin oscillations in a rotating magnetic field @xcite . without any further couplings the oscillation continues without any damping as long as the light field is present .",
    "a different but completely equivalent picture of rabi oscillations is provided in the framework of the dressed state basis introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . here",
    "the exciting light field gives rise to the splitting of the dressed states by the rabi frequency and rabi oscillations correspond to a quantum beat of these two states .",
    "the coupling to phonons disturbs these ideal rabi oscillations .",
    "it is instructive to first discuss the influence of the phonons on rabi oscillations in the time regime to understand their influence on the state preparation .",
    "experimentally measured rabi oscillations as a function of time for increasing laser power .",
    "the dashed line marks the envelope of the laser pulse .",
    "the measurement has been performed by photocurrent detection of the time - dependent autler - townes - splitting from the exciton - to - biexciton transition .",
    "figure reprinted with permission from boyle _ et al _ @xcite.,width=264 ]    the measurement of time - resolved rabi oscillations for a single qd is experimentally challenging . to measure the time dependence of the rabi oscillations , the change in the autler - townes - splitting in the tls formed by the exciton - biexciton transition has been detected @xcite .",

    "[ fig : rabiexp ] .",
    "when the laser power is increased , the rabi frequency increases and more rabi oscillations can take place during the pulse .",
    "furthermore , the rabi oscillations are damped and the damping increases with increasing power .",
    "time - resolved rabi oscillations have also been observed experimentally for a qd placed in a microcavity where the light - matter interaction was in the strong coupling regime . here ,",
    "the rabi oscillations reveal themselves in the time - resolved correlation function @xcite .",
    "recently time - resolved rabi oscillations have been measured by monitoring the time - dependent resonance fluorescence from a singly charged qd , where a tls is formed by the negatively charged ground state and the trion state @xcite .",
    "the coupling to phonons has several effects on the rabi oscillations .",
    "first , it leads to a damping of the oscillations .",

    "this renormalization of the exciton - light interaction strength gives rise to a change in the frequency of the rabi oscillations compared to its phonon - free value .",

    "depending on the sample structure and the excitation conditions different coupling mechanisms may be responsible for the observed damping . for example , the intensity - dependent damping of rabi rotations with a pulse area up to @xmath91 has been attributed to simultaneous bound - to - continuum transitions involving wetting layer states @xcite . a very good agreement of the damping behavior of measured rabi rotations with pulse areas up to @xmath92 and theoretical calculations including the electron - phonon coupling as described in sec .

    "( [ eq : phonon - spect ] ) ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : spectraldensity ] ) .",
    "the spectral density clearly reveals that only phonons in a certain frequency window are efficiently coupled to the exciton and that there is a frequency @xmath95 where the coupling is most efficient . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectraldensity ] , this frequency depends on the qd size ; it can be roughly identified as the frequency of phonons with a wave length of the order of the qd size .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the damping can now be understood in terms of a resonance between the exciton dynamics characterized by the rabi frequency @xmath65 and the dynamics of the most strongly coupled phonons characterized by @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "if these two frequencies coincide , the damping will be strongest . for much smaller rabi frequencies ( @xmath96 ) the electronic system oscillates",
    "so slowly that the phonon system follows essentially adiabatically and no energy is transferred irreversibly to the phonons . on the other hand , for rabi frequencies",
    "much higher than the resonance ( @xmath97 ) the change in the electronic system is so fast that the phonons can not follow leading again to an inefficient coupling .    instead of using the resonance argument in the time domain ,",
    "also the spectral domain can be employed for the interpretation of the non - monotonic dependence of the damping on the rabi frequency @xcite .",
    "the driving light field gives rise to the appearance of dressed states with an energy splitting given by the rabi frequency @xmath65 .",
    "phonon - induced transitions between the dressed states occur with a rate which is proportional to the phonon spectral density at the frequency corresponding to this energy splitting , which again explains why these transitions , and therefore the damping , are most pronounced when the rabi frequency coincides with the position of the maximum of the spectral density , i.e. , when @xmath98 .",
    "the non - monotonic damping and the reappearance of rabi rotations are a general behavior related to the structure of the exciton - phonon coupling in qds . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : reapp ] , it also occurs for a coupling which is much stronger than the one in typical qd structures and at rather high temperatures , when there are essentially no more oscillations visible in a certain window of rabi frequencies .",
    "the details of the occurrence of the reappearance , however , strongly depend on many details of the exciting laser pulse , e.g. , the pulse duration or the pulse shape .",
    "for pulses shorter than @xmath99 already for a @xmath70-pulse the excitonic dynamics is faster than the phonon dynamics such that already the first rotation is in the regime of decreasing damping .",
    "therefore , rabi rotations for short pulse excitations are essentially undamped @xcite .",
    "the pulse shape determines the distribution of rabi frequencies during the action of the pulse .",
    "a rectangular pulse is characterized by a single , fixed rabi frequency during the pulse .",
    "therefore there is a clear resonance and the reappearance sets in immediately above the resonance . in a gaussian pulse ,",
    "on the other hand , the rabi frequency increases continuously from zero to a maximal value and then decreases again .",
    "therefore , even if the amplitude at the pulse maximum is already beyond the resonance there are parts of the pulse in the leading and trailing edge where the amplitude satisfies the resonance condition and therefore a pronounced damping is present during these times .",
    "for this reason , in the case of a gaussian pulse the amplitude of the rabi rotations grows much slower after the onset of the reappearance and much higher pulse areas are required to reenter the regime of pronounced rabi rotations @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on rabi rotations with pulse areas up to @xmath92 have been quantitatively described by the model on which the present review is based @xcite .",
    "indeed for small pulse areas the influence of phonons is small and increases with increasing pulse area .",
    "the regime of reappearance of rabi rotations has not yet been clearly reached in these experiments , even though a detailed comparison with calculations suggests that some features of the measurements can be regarded as first hints for an onset of the reappearance .",
    "both experimental and theoretical studies thus show that in order to achieve a high - fidelity state preparation based on a resonant excitation it is necessary to carefully select the excitation conditions regarding pulse length , pulse shape and pulse area .",
    "the optical control typically performs better when choosing short , rectangular pulses and working within a pulse area range up to @xmath100 . of course , when optimizing the excitation conditions the limitations of the model have to be kept in mind . for long pulses ,",
    "other dephasing or relaxation mechanisms such as radiative decay may become effective @xcite .",
    "short pulses with their broad spectrum may excite other transitions either in the same dot or in nearby dots which also deteriorates the preparation of the desired state .",
    "currently also the optical control of qds in a microcavity has come into the focus of attention , where vacuum rabi oscillations and the corresponding vacuum rabi splitting are seen as indications for reaching the strong coupling regime between light and matter @xcite . in the case of strong light - matter coupling",
    "there is a strong interplay between exciton - phonon and light - matter interaction , which for example can be seen in the line - width broadening in the mollow - triplet @xcite .",
    "the combined exciton - photon and exciton - phonon interaction in the strong coupling regime has been subject to many theoretical works @xcite . a detailed discussion of the phenomena related to the interplay between these coupling mechanisms is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "so far we have mostly discussed the influence of phonons on the occupation of the qd states . for applications of optically controlled qds in quantum information processing",
    "it is also necessary to prepare a given superposition state , e.g. , a superposition of ground and exciton state @xcite .",
    "one way to create a superposition state is to use a rabi rotation with a pulse area , which is not equal to a multiple of @xmath70 .",
    "for example , a @xmath76 pulse applied to a tls creates a superposition between ground and exciton state @xmath101 . in the language of quantum information processing applying a @xmath76 pulse corresponds to the action of a hadamard gate on a qubit consisting of the states",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath35 @xcite .    the ability to fully control the tls",
    "is often demonstrated in ramsey interference experiments , where a pair of two @xmath76 pulses is used to resonantly excite the qd @xcite .",
    "if the second pulse is in phase with the polarization created by the first pulse , there is constructive interference driving the system into the exciton state @xmath35 .",
    "if the second pulse has the opposite phase as the polarization there is destructive interference ; the exciton is removed from the qd and the ground state @xmath5 is restored . when plotted as a function of the phase difference between the pulses",
    "this leads in an ideal tls to oscillations of the exciton occupation between zero and one . in the presence of dephasing processes",
    "these oscillations are damped .",
    "also for the preparation of superposition states the phonons are a major source of dephasing . besides the dephasing during the action of the pulse , which can be reduced by using short pulses , the polarization is in general subject to dephasing even after the preparation of the state",
    "this becomes clear for an excitation with ultrafast laser pulses , where the phonons can not act during the pulse .",
    "after the generation of a superposition state the occupations remain constant , but the polarization decays as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarization ] for the case of an excitation by pulses with a pulse area of @xmath76 and three different pulse durations . in the case of ultrafast excitation the maximal polarization of @xmath77 is reached .",

    "a slightly lower value is reached , but the behavior is still similar to the ultrafast limit . because the ultrafast excitation of an exciton leads to an almost simultaneous change of the charge density , the equilibrium position of the crystal lattice changes . due to the abrupt change ,",
    "coherent phonons are created and in the case of acoustic phonons a coherent wave packet is sent out of the dot which carries away information from the qd @xcite .",
    "this leads to the observed dephasing of the coherence @xcite .",
    "after the wave packet has left the dot , the polarization exhibits no further decay caused by the phonons .",
    "the time scale of the initial decay is determined by the time the wave packet needs to leave the qd .",
    "other interaction mechanisms , in particular radiative decay , give rise to an exponential decay on a much longer time scale @xcite .",
    "the non - exponential decay of the polarization , which is a clear indication of the non - markovian nature of the exciton - phonon coupling in the absence of a driving light field , has been measured using four - wave - mixing techniques @xcite .    from the polarization dynamics after an ultrafast excitation the absorption spectrum of the qd can be obtained , which consists of the zero phonon line and the typical phonon background resulting from the interaction with acoustic phonons . the interaction with optical phonons",
    "gives rise to satellites in the spectrum separated by multiples of the optical phonon frequency , which again are superimposed on a background due to the acoustic phonons .",
    "this type of spectra has been seen in many experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .    for longer pulses ,",
    "the change of the electronic charge density caused by the excitation of the qd is much slower and , for sufficiently long pulses in the adiabatic limit no wave packet is emitted .",

    "this behavior is significantly changed by the interaction with phonons . as in the resonant case ,",
    "the oscillations are damped and , for larger detunings , where in the phonon - free case the amplitude is small , they are hardly resolved @xcite .",
    "in addition , at low temperatures there is a strong asymmetry between positive and negative detunings . for positive detunings , i.e. , a laser frequency above the resonance , superimposed on the weak oscillations there is a growth of the exciton occupation as a function of time , whereas it decreases for negative detunings @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry reflects a thermalization in the dressed state basis and can be traced back to the fact that immediately after switching on a pulse with positive detuning , the dressed state with the higher ground state contribution is more strongly occupied . for positive detunings this is the upper dressed state [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : dressed - states ] ) ] while for negative detunings it is the lower one .",
    "thermalization at low temperatures is mainly governed by phonon emission processes leading at longer times to a dominant occupation of the lower dressed state , which for positive detunings has a large exciton state contribution .",

    "indeed , calculations for excitations with a constant light field have shown that exciton occupations arbitrarily close to one can be reached @xcite . however , in order to make off - resonant excitations useful for state preparation purposes , the process has also to be sufficiently fast such that other relaxation mechanisms not included in the model , e.g. , the radiative decay , are not yet efficient in reducing the exciton occupation again . for dots without a cavity , this is not a very severe restriction , as the typical time scale for radiative decay is of the order of one nanosecond @xcite . for dots in cavities ,",
    "often cavity losses are the main relaxation process @xcite which , depending on the quality factor , can demand for noticeably shorter preparation times .",
    "a short time scale of phonon - induced relaxation and a high fidelity of exciton generation seem to be two conflicting ingredients .",
    "the phonon emission rate is determined on the one hand by the phonon spectral density [ eq .  ( [ eq : phonon - spect ] ) ] at the energy of the splitting between the dressed states , and on the other hand , since phonons only couple to the excitonic part of the electronic state , by the exciton contribution in the dressed states .",
    "this favors energy splittings in a certain energy window ( cf .",
    "[ fig : spectraldensity ] ) and parameters such that both dressed states as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dressed - states ] ) have a noticeable exciton contribution . to achieve a high fidelity ,",
    "the lower dressed state that is eventually reached at the end of the preparation process , should be as close as possible to the exciton state . in the case of excitation by a rectangular pulse ,",
    "when the character of the dressed states remains constant over the pulse , there is a conflict between these two requirements .",
    "the condition of a strongly exciton - dominated lower dressed state means that the upper dressed state almost coincides with the ground state giving rise to a very small overlap and thus to a very low phonon emission rate",
    ". the minimal time required to achieve a certain degree of fidelity is therefore determined by a trade - off between these two opposite aspects . in the case of excitation by a gaussian pulse the character of the dressed states changes over the duration of the pulse .",
    "close to the pulse maximum a strong driving introduces a strong mixing between ground and exciton state in both dressed states , while for decreasing amplitude the lower dressed state evolves into the pure exciton state thus favoring a high - fidelity preparation .",
    "analogous arguments given here for the exciton system hold for the exciton - biexciton system .",
    "recent calculations have shown that under realistic excitation conditions a high - fidelity and robust phonon - assisted preparation targeted at either the exciton or the biexciton is indeed possible on a picosecond time scale @xcite .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : bi - prep - offres ] displays results for the preparation of the biexciton where the final biexciton occupation after the pulse is plotted as a function of the biexciton binding energy @xmath19 and the pulse area @xmath69 at @xmath122  k. in these calculations , a linearly polarized laser pulse with duration @xmath114  ps fwhm has been tuned in resonance with the ground state - to - exciton transition . for vanishing @xmath19 ,",

    "it turns out that for a broad range of typical biexciton binding energies and sufficiently high pulse areas an almost perfect preparation with biexciton occupations close to one can be achieved .",
    "the phonon - coupling between the dressed states turns out to be sufficiently strong , such that the final values plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bi - prep - offres ] , which document a preparation of an almost pure biexciton state , are reached on a time scale of @xmath123 ps @xcite . in order to realize such short preparation times",
    ", one exploits the fact that the phonon - induced relaxation strongly depends on the system parameters such as the qd size and the electron - phonon coupling strength as well as on the driving parameters such as the pulse area and the pulse length .",
    "once the parameters are chosen in a regime favorable for fast relaxation , the protocol turns out to be robust with respect to changes in the pulse area as well as to the precise value of the biexciton binding energy .    being caused by phonon emission processes , the state preparation speeds up , when the carrier - phonon coupling increases . like all the other results discussed in this review , the calculations shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bi - prep - offres ] correspond to the weak coupling limit realized for ingaas - type qds , while for other materials such as , e.g. , gan , the carrier - phonon coupling can be substantially stronger @xcite .",
    "thus , in contrast to the other preparation protocols discussed in this review , which work best in the absence of the carrier - phonon coupling , the phonon - assisted preparation based on off - resonant driving performs the better the stronger the carrier - phonon coupling is @xcite . finally , we note that the high biexciton occupations found in fig .",
    "[ fig : bi - prep - offres ] also imply that the exciton state is eventually unoccupied even though it is resonantly driven .",
    "this is because the lowest dressed state has an almost vanishing exciton contribution .",
    "in fact , the resonant driving of the exciton with linearly polarized laser pulses turns out to be most favorable for preparing the biexciton .",
    "using lasers that are off - resonant to all transitions in the exciton - biexciton system is typically less efficient .",

    "this is achieved by a circularly polarized excitation  in order to suppress the coupling to the biexciton  by a laser pulse which is positively detuned with respect to the ground state - to - exciton transition .",
    "for such an excitation , fig .",

    "[ fig : spectraldensity ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - prep - offres](b ) the final exciton occupation is plotted as a function of the pulse area for several pulse lengths .",
    "clearly , when the pulse length is below 10 ps , the maximal occupation that can be reached is noticeably lower than one and quickly further degrades when the pulse area is not optimally chosen .",
    "however , already for pulse durations above @xmath114  ps , the final exciton occupation stays close to one for a broad range of pulse areas .",
    "figure  [ fig : x - prep - offres ] therefore again confirms the robustness of the phonon - assisted scheme against variations of detuning , pulse area and pulse length within certain windows determined by material and excitation parameters .",
    "in this review we have discussed various schemes that have been used for the preparation of excitonic and biexcitonic states in self - assembled qds by means of optical excitations .",
    "the focus of the discussion was on the role of phonons for these excitation schemes .",
    "three basically different schemes have been presented in the previous section : ( i ) an excitation by resonant laser pulses employing rabi oscillations , ( ii ) an excitation by using chirped laser pulses based on arp , and ( iii ) an excitation by detuned laser pulses relying on phonon - assisted exciton or biexciton generation . in the following",
    "we will compare these schemes regarding different aspects and discuss the advantages , drawbacks , and limitations of the respective scheme .",
    "first of all , when talking about state generation one has to distinguish between the generation of pure exciton or biexciton states and the generation of arbitrary superposition states .",
    "of the three schemes discussed in this review only the resonant excitation can be used for the preparation of superposition states .",
    "superposition states are in general subject to phonon - induced dephasing after their generation .",
    "however , due to the non - markovian nature of the pure dephasing process this dephasing is not complete . by excitation with",
    "not too short laser pulses the irreversibility which is associated with the emission of a phonon wave packet can be reduced . for long pulses , on the other hand ,",
    "the dephasing during the excitation process caused by phonon - induced transitions between the dressed states as well as by other dephasing mechanisms becomes more important , such that an optimum for the pulse duration exists .",
    "the fidelity of the state preparation in this case strongly depends on the details of the qd structure and on the temperature .",
    "pure exciton and biexciton states can be prepared by all three mechanisms .",
    "for all three schemes there is no fundamental limitation of the achievable fidelity caused by the interaction with phonons , although limitations may arise from the approximations inherent in the model , e.g. , by neglecting higher excitonic states as well as other coupling mechanisms , in particular the radiative decay . in the case of rabi rotations",
    "the fidelity of exciton or biexciton preparation can be made arbitrarily high in the limit of ultrafast excitations , because here the dynamics in the exciton system becomes much faster than the phonon dynamics such that the phonons can not follow . in the arp scheme using excitations with chirped pulses a high - fidelity generation of excitons and biexcitons can be reached . in the case of positive chirps at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "when phonon absorption processes are negligible , a high - fidelity preparation is possible in a wide range of pulse areas while for negative chirps the pulse areas are restricted to a window between about @xmath70 and @xmath100 . for excitations with detuned pulses exciton and biexciton occupations arbitrarily close to one",
    "can be achieved by using sufficiently long pulses at low temperatures such that the relaxation from the upper to the lower dressed state by phonon emission is essentially complete and phonon absorption processes can be neglected .",
    "a clear advantage of schemes ( ii ) and ( iii ) over the resonant excitation scheme ( i ) is their robustness with respect to pulse and system parameters .",
    "once a certain threshold of pulse intensity and pulse duration is overcome , the exciton or biexciton generation is rather insensitive to variations of these parameters .",
    "this has the advantage that no detailed knowledge of the individual qd is required to perform the state preparation .",
    "furthermore , for this reason the schemes also work for ensembles of qds with a distribution of energies and dipole matrix elements , as long as these distributions are sufficiently narrow . in the case of arp",
    "the adiabaticity condition has to be fulfilled for the whole ensemble , in the case of off - resonant excitation the splitting of the dressed states of each qd in the ensemble has to be in the range such that phonon emission occurs with a sufficient rate and phonon absorption processes are negligible .",
    "when comparing the robust schemes ( ii ) and ( iii ) one observes that for typical qd structures arp works often best for pulse areas given by a few multiples of @xmath70 while the off - resonant preparation requires pulse areas above @xmath91 . on the other hand",
    ", they have an opposite trend when varying the phonon coupling constant , e.g. , by considering different material systems .",
    "since phonon emission becomes more efficient for increasing exciton - phonon coupling the pulse area required for the state preparation in scheme ( iii ) decreases , while the coherent schemes ( i ) and ( ii ) typically deteriorate for increasing phonon coupling .",
    "also the temperature plays a quite different role in the different schemes .",
    "schemes ( ii ) and ( iii ) rely on the absence of phonon absorption processes between the dressed states .",
    "since the splitting between the dressed states is in the range of a few mev , already at temperatures of about @xmath89  k the rate of phonon absorption is of the same order as the phonon emission rate .",
    "therefore , an equal occupation of ground and exciton state will be reached and the state preparation becomes rather inefficient .",
    "in the case of arp this limitation may be partly overcome either by using pulses with rather low pulse areas around @xmath70 , where phonon - induced transitions are not yet very efficient or by using pulses with very high pulse areas , where the phonons are effectively decoupled . in the resonant scheme ( i ) , on the other hand , at least a few rabi rotations have been clearly observed up to temperatures of @xmath128  k. even higher temperatures should in principle be possible by using shorter pulses , as long as the increased spectral width of the pulse does not lead to the excitation of other nearby transitions which may be present in a real qd .",
    "the above discussion clearly demonstrates that there is not a single simple criterion which defines the `` best '' state preparation scheme in a qd .",
    "instead , the selection of the optimal scheme for a given purpose depends on the final state to be prepared as well as on a variety of different conditions such as material parameters or temperature , but also on limitations due to phenomena not included in the model .",
    "other nearby transitions may set a lower limit for the pulse duration , while additional dephasing or relaxation channels may set an upper limit for the time of the preparation process .",
    "however , the discussion also clearly demonstrates that the underlying model , despite its simplicity , is able to quantitatively describe a variety of experimental results and therefore can be seen as a prototypical model for an interacting many - body system which , due to its simplicity , is able to provide detailed physical insights in the dynamics of coupled fermion - boson systems ."
