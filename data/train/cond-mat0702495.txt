    "a growing number of observations point to the possibility that high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors may not be conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superconductors @xcite , but rather derive from the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of real - space pairs , as proposed by mott and others @xcite .",
    "a possible fundamental origin of such strong departure of the cuprates from conventional bcs behaviour is the unscreened ( frhlich ) epi with a polaron shift , @xmath1 of the order of 1 ev ( la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , @xmath4ev ) @xcite , routinely neglected in the hubbard @xmath5 and @xmath6 models @xcite .",
    "this interaction with @xmath7axis polarized optical phonons is virtually unscreened because the upper limit for the out - of - plane plasmon frequency ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite ) is well below the characteristic frequency of optical phonons , @xmath10 400 - 1000 cm @xmath11 .",
    "since screening is poor , the magnetic interaction remains small compared with the frhlich epi at any doping of cuprates . in order to generate a convincing theory of high - temperature superconductivity",
    ", one must treat the coulomb repulsion and _ unscreened _ epi on an equal footing .",
    "when both interactions are strong compared with the kinetic energy of carriers , the so - called `` coulomb - frhlich '' model ( cfm ) predicts a ground state in the form of mobile , preformed , inter - site pairs dressed by lattice deformations ( i.e intersite bipolarons ) @xcite .",
    "the most compelling evidence for ( bi)polaronic carriers in novel superconductors is the discovery of a substantial isotope effect on the carrier mass @xcite predicted by the bipolaron theory @xcite .",
    "recent high resolution arpes @xcite provides another piece of evidence for a strong epi in cuprates between electrons and c - axis - polarised optical phonons @xcite .",
    "these , as well as recent tunnelling @xcite , earlier optical @xcite and neutron scattering @xcite experiments unambiguously show that lattice vibrations play a significant though unconventional role in high temperature superconductors .",
    "remarkably , earlier path - integral studies of large bipolarons in the continuous limit @xcite ) led to a double surprise : ( a ) the large bipolaron is only stable in a very limited sector of the parameter space ( coulomb repulsion versus the frhlich coupling constant ) ( b ) most traditional `` frhlich polaron '' materials ( alkali halides and the like ) lie completely outside ( and `` far '' from ) this bipolaron stability sector , but several high-@xmath12 superconductors lie very close and even inside this rather restricted area of stability in the parameter space .",
    "when the strong frhlich epi operates together with a shorter range deformation potential and molecular - type ( e.g. jahn - teller ) epis , it readily overcomes the coulomb repulsion at short distances of about the lattice constant , so that large ( continuous ) bipolarons become local ( lattice ) bipolarons in narrow bands @xcite . even at significant doping local pairs",
    "are not overlapped , so that a high critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) could be achieved , if they are sufficiently mobile .",
    "analysis of the site - local holstein - hubbard model has indicated that in order for the coulomb repulsion ( hubbard @xmath5 ) to be overcome by the induced attractive force between electrons , epi must be so large that the polaron ( and bipolaron ) masses must be huge , rendering the transition temperature minuscule @xcite .",
    "all is not lost , however , since the holstein interaction is the extreme short - range limit of a finite range epi . using the finite - range epi it is possible for electrons to pair between sites @xcite without requiring the electron - phonon induced attraction to be larger than the hubbard @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the individual polarons are significantly lighter , so the mass of the pair has potential to be orders of magnitude smaller than in the holstein case .    to put these arguments on a solid microscopic ground we simulate the cfm hamiltonian on a lattice using an advanced qmc technique for bipolarons and compare with analytic results in the strong coupling and anti - adiabatic limits .",
    "first , we introduce the model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the cfm is written as @xmath13 each ion has a displacement @xmath14 .",
    "sites labels are @xmath15 and @xmath16 for electrons and ions respectively . @xmath17 annihilate electrons .",
    "the phonons are einstein oscillators with frequency @xmath18 and mass @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 denote pairs of nearest neighbours , and @xmath21 ion momentum operators .",
    "the instantaneous interaction @xmath22 has on - site repulsion @xmath5 and nearest neighbour interaction @xmath23 ( if the electron - phonon coupling term is set to zero , one obtains the simple @xmath24 model ) .",
    "the force function is of the screened frhlich type , @xmath25^{3/2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|{\\mathbf{m}}-{\\mathbf{n}}|}{r_{sc}}\\right)\\ ] ] ( @xmath26 is a constant ) @xcite .",
    "we will also use a slightly different notation for the electron - phonon interaction term here , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a dimensionless interaction proportional to the force , and @xmath29 create phonons at site @xmath30 .",
    "we set @xmath31 .",
    "such a model has a remarkable property .",
    "unlike the site local holstein model , there is attraction ( and potentially pairing ) even in the presence of very strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the model is justified in the presence of alternating planes of itinerant electrons and ions , where there is strong screening along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "there have been a number of studies discussing the masses of polarons and bipolarons with long range interaction @xcite .",
    "the polaron formed from the long - range frhlich interaction proposed in @xcite has been simulated in reference @xcite , demonstrating that the polaron mass may be significantly lighter than its holstein counterpart .",
    "this is due to the nature of polarons in the holstein case , which may be demonstrated nicely by examining the lang - firsov transformation . in that transformation ,",
    "the operators in the hamiltonian are replaced in the following way , @xmath32 \\\\",
    "d_j \\rightarrow \\tilde{d}_j = d_{j } + \\sum_i g_{ij } n_i & \\hspace{10 mm } & c_i \\rightarrow \\tilde{c}_i = c_i \\exp[-\\sum_j g_{ij } ( d^{\\dagger}_j - d_j ) ] \\label{eqn : lffour}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus hopping processes in the holstein polaron ( where @xmath33 ) take place by a complete relaxation of the lattice on the initial site , a hop , and then a distortion on the target site . with a longer range interaction , the lattice is pre - distorted before the particle moves , leading to a much smoother process with a lower intermediate energy state",
    ". we have recently determined that long - range interactions lead to a reduction of the importance of geometry on the properties of the bipolaron , especially the mass , leading to very similar results on triangular and square lattice @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the crossover between frhlich and holstein polarons later in this article .",
    "the lang - firsov transformation is an exact canonical transformation , and leads to a transformed hamiltonian with a new transformed wavefunction @xmath34 .",
    "it is most instructive to consider the transformation of the atomic hamiltonian and the transformation of the hopping terms separately , since typically the lang - firsov transformation is the starting point for a series of perturbative analyses .",
    "when the hopping term is set to zero , the phonon portion of the cfm is written as follows : @xmath35 ( n.b . the index @xmath36 is now taken to contain a spin and a site index ) . applying the lang - firsov canonical transformation , and [ eqn : lffour ] shows that electron number operators are unchanged on transformation , so the coulomb part of the hamiltonian is also unchanged ] @xmath37\\\\ & = & - \\sum_{ii ' } n_i n_{i ' } \\sum_{j } \\frac{f_{ij } f_{i'j}}{2 \\omega^2 m }   + \\omega \\sum_j \\left(d^{\\dagger}_j d_j + \\frac{1}{2}\\right ) \\label{eqn : atomic_g } \\label{eqn : shift}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we reordered the summation , and noted that @xmath38 .",
    "this shows the remarkable property of the lang - firsov transformation , since the electron and phonon subsystems in the atomic limit are now completely decoupled .    at this stage",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the following function , @xmath39=\\sum_{\\mathbf{m}}f_{\\mathbf{m}}[\\mathbf{r}(\\tau)]f_{\\mathbf{m}+\\delta\\mathbf{r}}[\\mathbf{r}(\\tau')]\\ ] ] where the reason for adding an additional translation , @xmath40 , to the phonon sub - system will become apparent when the action is introduced in the next section . for the following discussion , @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 function for the ladder systems investigated in this paper is shown in figure [ fig : phifunction ] , corresponding to a screened frhlich interaction with @xmath43 .",
    "we also define the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the magnitude of the energy of the tight - binding electron ( normally the half band - width @xmath46 ) .",
    "as we can see from equation [ eqn : shift ] , the energy shift when there is only one particle ( polaron shift for @xmath47 ) is @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath49 . substituting that definition into the atomic hamiltonian ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath50 the reason for introducting the new functions @xmath42 can immediately be seen , since they appear in the hamiltonian as a ratio .",
    "thus , in combination with @xmath51 they give a universal definition of coupling in models with long - range hopping .",
    "substitution of equations ( [ eqn : lfone]-[eqn : lffour ] ) transforms the tight binding hamiltonian in the following way : @xmath52 where @xmath53 i.e. we can see that the electron - phonon interaction in the transformed hamiltonian is part of the hopping process , and that to some extent , one may regard the operators @xmath54 as creating polarons ( i.e. electrons and a phonon cloud at the same time ) .",

    "so , @xmath63 and @xmath64   = 0 $ ] since the commutator is a number , equation [ eqn : exponentidentity ] may be applied .",
    "the hopping operator becomes : @xmath65    now , the identity may be used again , making the grouping , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . thus @xmath64 = -\\sum_{j } ( g_{ij }",
    "- g_{i'j})(g_{ij } - g_{i'j})$ ] , and @xmath68 e^ { \\sum_j ( g_{ij } - g_{i'j } ) d^{\\dagger}_j } e^ { - \\sum_j ( g_{ij } - g_{i'j } ) d_j } \\ ] ]    this form is particularly useful , due to the order of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "thus , when one carries out the perturbation theory , calculation is reduced to computing matrix elements of the form , @xmath69 .",
    "it s interesting to note that , when computed as an average over the atomic wavefunction , the hopping integral may be regarded as being modified by the epi as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "such an approximation is valid in the anti - adiabatic limit , and will be revisited later in this paper .",

    "[ fig : examplepath ]      in the path integral qmc with two paths , it is necessary to make two kink operations simulataneously to ensure that the end configurations remain identical up to a translation .",

    "first , kink / antikink pair addition / removal on a single path is useful , since it always maintains the same end configurations up to a change in the interpath displacement .",
    "second , kink pair additions on different paths are needed in the analysis of the bipolaron mass , where the @xmath81 end configuration must be exactly equal to the @xmath83 end configuration up to a parallel shift . within both subclasses , there are two specific update types that satisfy the imaginary - time boundary conditions , as follows :    * two kinks of the same type @xmath90 are added to or removed from two different paths . *",

    "is added to one path , and an antikink @xmath91 is removed from the other path .",
    "an important property of the bipolaron system is that the type and time of added or removed kinks still does not define the new path unambiguously .",

    "this could change the path in two different ways : either the path at times @xmath93 is shifted in the direction @xmath90 , or the path at times @xmath94 is shifted in the antidirection @xmath90 .",

    "problem the distinction between the top and bottom shifts was not important because they are identical up to a translation of the entire path .",
    "this argument does not hold for two paths , since the resulting interpath distance in a binary update changes with shift type , thus a choice of shifts is an important part of the monte carlo update process .",

    "a consequence of exchange is that singlet and triplet states are not degenerate .",

    ", we specifically discuss the changes to the masses of polaron moving on trangular and square lattices as the screening length @xmath189 is varied .",
    "the polaron mass forms part of the argument later in this article .    screened frhlich electron - phonon interactions were simulated by spencer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who demonstrated a continuous crossover between the frhlich and holstein limits on the chain .",
    "in particular , the mass of the particle is found to be light down to quite small screening radii , consistent with results by bona and trugman @xcite for nearest - neighbour electron - phonon interactions .",
    "we have previously computed the properties of polarons on several bravais lattices , showing that the effects of the lattice type on the properties of the polaron are ` washed out ' by long range interactions @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : polaronmass ] shows the effective mass of the dicrete frhlich polaron on square and triangular lattices .",
    "frhlich polarons are significantly lighter than their holstein counterparts , due to the long range interaction .",
    "we have also shown that the overriding factor for the properties of holstein polarons is the number of nearest neighbours in the lattice , and not the dimensionality @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in long - range interactions in this paper , then it suffices to note that the masses of frhlich polarons are of the same order of magnitude on all lattice types , and that they are extremely light @xcite .",
    "the properties of realistic screened interactions lie somewhere inbetween , but such polarons remain light down to quite small interaction ranges of the order of a lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "the properties of bipolarons are significantly more complicated than those of polarons .",
    "one expects bound holstein bipolarons in strongly correlated materials to be extremely heavy , since a very large attractive potential is needed to overcome the repulsion .",
    "this is not true for longer range interactions . according to work by bona and trugman @xcite , even bipolarons with nearest neighbour interactions are significantly more mobile than their holstein counterparts (",
    "indeed , one normally expects the mass of a bipolaron to scale like the squared mass of the polaron , so polarons which are an order of magnitude lighter than holstein ones , may become bipolarons which are two orders of magnitude lighter ) .",
    "another extremely interesting proposition is the role of geometry on the bipolaron mass .",
    "when bipolarons are bound on nearest neighbour sites , and another degenerate state may be reached in a single hopping event , the leading correction to the atomic hamiltonian is first order in the hopping term , and not second order as one might expect for the holstein model , which leads to a bipolaron with a mass that is of similar order of magnitude to the polaron mass ( i.e. a superlight bipolaron ) @xcite .",
    "such systems may be realised on triangular lattices , or on lattices with large next - nearest neighbour hopping .",
    "we have recently extended our quantum monte - carlo algorithm to explore this type of bipolaron , leading to similar conclusions @xcite . in this paper , we discuss some of these extensions to the algorithm to look at two types of ladder system shown in figure [ fig : laddersystems ] .",
    "since the particles on the different legs of the ladder can not exchange the very weak - couping limit is not well bound , consisting of two large polarons . as such",
    ", the weak - coupling perturbation theory can be made about the unbound state .",
    "as will become apparent when we show the quantum monte - carlo results , the number of phonons is small for the weakly bound states , especially in the anti - adiabatic limit .",
    "the perturbation theory in the electron - phonon coupling term only excites single phonons , so if the number of phonons becomes too large , the theory fails . in the presence of strong on - site repulsion ,",
    "the bipolaron is not bound at zero coupling . in general ,",
    "if there is a bound state for @xmath190 , then this perturbation expansion fails .",
    "the expansion is written as follows : @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the number of momentum states .",
    "thus the ground state polaron energy ( at @xmath195 ) is @xmath196 , which defines a dimensionless coefficient @xmath197 .",
    "there is no general analytic solution for the second order perturbation theory , but values may be computed using numerical integration .",
    "the number of phonons , isotope exponent and inverse mass may also be written as , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the weak coupling limits for the polaron are discussed in references @xcite amoung others .",
    "@xmath51 is defined as before .",
    "aspects of the strong coupling limit are easy to compute from the path integral formalism . in the very strong coupling limit ,",
    "the most common configurations are straight paths , since the action is proportional to @xmath51 and that configuration gives the smallest possible action .",
    "thus the strong coupling action reads : @xmath201 for a polaron , the total energy for a self - interacting strong - coupling system ( i.e. a straight path ) is @xmath202 , where @xmath45 is the half band width , @xmath203 .",

    "this result is of little suprise , since there are 2 polarons in a bipolaron , with @xmath202 each , and 2 inter - polaron binding terms with @xmath207 .",
    "we may also compute the number of phonons associated with the bipolaron in a similar manner using equation [ eq : ten ] with @xmath208 , which we obtain as : @xmath209/\\hbar\\omega\\ ] ]    as we have discussed , the @xmath42 functions for the ladder systems with @xmath43 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phifunction ] . numerical values for @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 are shown in table [ tab : strong ] , from which numerical values for the strong coupling behaviour are computed .",
    "we discuss the region of validity of these results when we compute the exact qmc results .",
    "in particular , if we plot appropriate ratios , such as the ratio @xmath213 , we expect saturation at strong coupling , consistent with table [ tab : strong ] .",
    "typically , it has been discussed that an expansion of the lang - firsov transformed hamiltonian in the polaron hopping can be used at strong coupling .",
    "the perturbation expansion to second order may be written as , @xmath214    the values for the strong coupling energy may be computed from the leading term of this expansion , and have the same form as the energy computed from the straight paths .",
    "this is not suprising , since the corrections to the energy are at least as small as @xmath215 .",
    "there is a subtle point associated with phonon numbers . by examination ,",
    "the ground state of the phonon subsystem in the * transformed * hamiltonian is @xmath216 . in order to determine the total number of phonons in the true ground state of the atomic hamiltonian",
    ", one must transform back to the regular wavefunction .",
    "one may either transform the wavefunction , or the phonon part of the hamiltonian .",
    "transforming the phonon part of the hamiltonian is easy , and one obtains , @xmath217 thus @xmath218 the expectation value of the phonons occupation may be rewritten in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath42 , thus : @xmath219 ( note the minus sign in front of the equation - phonon number is positive ) .",
    "thus one determines that the total number of phonons in the bipolaron case is : @xmath220 ( n.b . a similar argument can be used for polarons . )    unfortunately , the computation of the mass is not so simple .",
    "the mass is very sensitive to the exact form of the renormalised hopping , and the leading order of the perturbation expansion varies with lattice type . for the superlight small bipolarons on triangular plaquettes discussed here ,",
    "there is a leading term with order @xmath215 , and for rectangular systems , the leading order is @xmath221 .",
    "examination of the path integrals demonstrates that the mass is computed from a parallel shift .",
    "the first perturbation of the paths from the straight line in the atomic limit is the insertion of two parallel kinks ( one on each path ) . in order for the mass to be genuinely first order in the polaron hopping , we would require updates with only one kink .",
    "thus , there are significant contributions from the second order term , including a cancellation between the orders as @xmath222 .",
    "in fact , the expansion of the lang - firsov transformed hamiltonian to 1st order in the hopping turns out to correspond to the extreme anti - adiabatic limit , which we now discuss .    .strong coupling behaviour of the staggered and rectangular lattices . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the bipolaron dispersion can be evaluated analytically in the anti - adiabatic strong - coupling limit ( @xmath223 ) , in which case the problem can be reduced to that of a rigid dimer . in this limit",
    "the lang - firsov transformation@xcite eliminates the phonons from the coulomb - frhlich hamiltonian ( [ fh ] ) . in combination with an averaging over phonons consistent with the anti - adiabatic approximation ( if the phonon frequency is very large , there are no real phonons ) one obtains the following effective @xmath24 hamiltonian @xmath224 where the primed sum excludes self - interaction , and the renormalised on - site and inter - site interactions are @xmath225 and @xmath226 respectively .",
    "( there is no retardation in the anti - adiabatic limit . ) now suppose the on - site repulsion @xmath227 is large and repulsive and the inter - site interaction has a well - defined minimum @xmath228 at some separation .",

    "the low - energy sector for two electrons corresponds to dimer states ( bipolarons ) in which the electrons are on neighbouring sites ; the energies in this sector are @xmath235 .",
    "the energy cost of internal excitations of the bipolarons introduces a gap .",
    "we can now sharply distinguish two types of bipolaron motion : `` crab - like '' , in which the constituent polarons remain neighbours , and `` crawler '' , which requires virtual transitions out of the low - energy sector .",
    "the crab - like bipolaron bandwidth will be @xmath236 , while the crawler contributions will be @xmath237 .",
    "we shall for the present purposes project onto the low energy sector and hence ignore the resulting higher - order terms in @xmath238 , immobilising crawlers .",

    "this sign change ensures the correct exchange symmetry for closed paths on odd - membered rings : as a dimer completes one cycle of an odd - membered ring its end - points are interchanged .",

    "the requirement for a virtual internal excitation of the bipolaron in the crawler dynamics would lead to a hopping @xmath260 and hence mass @xmath261 .",
    "the staggered ladder with long range electron phonon attraction has two degenerate nearest neighbour bound states ( as summarised in figure 12 ) , so no intermediate state is required when the particle hops .",
    "it is clearly important that the electrons are bound one lattice spacing apart to take advantage of this effect , but this can easily be achieved in the presence of a strong site - local coulomb repulsion ( so that the energy is not at a minimum when both particles are on the same site ) .",
    "this spaced minimum is clearly extremely important when real lattices beyond the toy ladder models presented here are considered .",

    "we compute qmc results for bipolarons moving on staggered and rectangular ladders with period 1000 for a range of @xmath51 and @xmath18 , including the total energy , inverse bipolaron mass , bipolaron radius , mass isotope exponent and the number of phonons in the bipolaron cloud .",
    "figure [ fig : totalenergy ] shows the total energy of the bipolaron for ( a ) the rectangular ladder and ( b ) the staggered ladder .",
    "a slight change in gradient between weak and strong coupling is just discernable , demonstrating ( as we shall see in the coming figures ) that the staggered ladder reaches the strong coupling limit at significantly lower @xmath51 than the rectangular ladder .",
    "strong coupling results from the previous section agree well .",
    "we see that there are no significant differences between the total energy of the bipolarons on the staggered and rectangular ladders , although the strong coupling limit is reached for slightly lower @xmath51 in the case of the staggered ladder",
    ".    if one is to reach a superconducting state via the bose - einstein condensation of bipolarons , there are two conditions .",
    "first , the bipolaron pair must be light , and second , the pairing radius must be small .",
    "we demonstrate the differences between the inverse masses on the staggered and rectangular ladders in figures [ fig : inversemass](a ) and ( b ) , which show the inverse mass of the bipolaron for a number of different @xmath51 and @xmath262 .",
    "there is more than an order of magnitude difference between the mass of the bipolaron on the staggered ladder , and that on the rectangular ladder over significant regions of the parameter space .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the bipolaron mass turns out to be of similar size to that of the polaron mass over a wide range of the parameter space .",
    "the mass is inversely proportional to the transition temperature of the bec , so a small mass is essential to obtain a decent @xmath263 .",
    "we have demonstrated that one of the precursors for a bose - einstein condensate of pairs above the mk range may be met on the staggered ladder arrangement , but we also require small pairs , with non - overlapping wavefunctions . in figure",
    "[ fig : bipolaronsize ] we show how the the size of the bipolaron varies as @xmath51 and @xmath262 are varied .",
    "not only is the bipolaron on the staggered ladder lighter than that on the rectangular ladder , it is also has a significantly smaller radius than the bipolaron on the rectangular ladder , making it a much better prospect for bose - einstein condensation .    since the result that the bipolaron mass is proportional to the polaron mass via a numerical value relies on the anti - adiabatic limit , where the phonon frequency is very large , so that phonons may not be excited",
    ", we investigate the number of phonons asociated with the bipolaron in figure [ fig : nophonons ] .",
    "the result is weighted by phonon frequency and electron phonon coupling , so that the strong coupling result can clearly be seen .",
    "again , we can see that the strong - coupling limit is reached at significantly lower @xmath51 on the staggered ladder than on the rectangular ladder .",
    "strong coupling results from the previous section agree well , with the ratio @xmath264 approaching the numerical value given in table [ tab : strong ] .",
    "the anti - adiabatic limit can clearly be identified as regions on the graph where the phonon number approaches zero ( i.e. the @xmath265 quadrant of the parameter space ) , consistent with results for the mass .",
    "we show the mass isotope exponent of the bipolaron in figure [ fig : iex ] .",
    "again , we can see that the strong coupling limit is achieved at significantly lower @xmath51 on the staggered ladder , compared with the rectangular ladder .",
    "the isotope exponent is also smaller on the staggered ladder , demonstrating a much smaller range of mass from weak to strong coupling .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : path ] , we show example path configurations on ( a ) the rectangular ladder and ( b ) the staggered ladder . hopping events on different paths on the rectangular ladder are very closely correlated on the imaginary time axis . on the staggered ladder ,",
    "there are two degenerate configurations , and paths are just as likely to sit on either of the two neighbouring sites , significantly reducing the correlation between kinks , and increasing the probability that kink pairs can be inserted .",
    "it is this that leads to significantly lighter bipolarons on the staggered ladder .",
    "on the ladder systems , the electrons were held on neighbouring legs of the ladders .",
    "this is partially consistent with a very strong local coulomb repulsion or hubbard @xmath5 .",
    "it is also possible to examine the effects of a very strong or even infinite hubbard @xmath5 on the masses of bipolarons bound via long range attraction on other low dimensional systems .",
    "as we have seen by examining the ladder systems , there are 3 requirements for superlight bipolarons ( 1 ) electrons are not allowed to bind on a single site ( 2 ) there are at least two degenerate configurations of electrons sitting on neighbouring sites and ( 3 ) there are single hopping events which transform one configuration into another degenerate configurations .",
    "then , hopping of the bipolaron is first order in the hopping of the polaron .",
    "condition ( 2 ) is satisifed by long range electron - phonon intereraction , and there are several tight binding lattices which also satisfy conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and a strong site - local coulomb repulsion satisfies condition ( 1 ) .",
    "we discuss bipolarons on these lattices in the anti - adiabatic approximation in this section .",
    "the staggered ladder system discussed earlier in this paper can be considered to be made up of triangular plaquettes , so the first logical step to looking beyond the ladder systems is to analyse the physics of a single plaquette .",
    "if hopping is allowed between all the sites on the plaquette , then one may consider exchange effects , which lead to singlet and triplet bound states . to see exchange effects",
    ", we require lattices with odd - membered rings . as the simplest example , consider three sites @xmath266 , all of which are neighbours , with hopping @xmath267 .",
    "the polaron hamiltonian is @xmath268 the dimer lattice is constructed by placing a node at the centre of each bond .",
    "the singlet bipolaron hamiltonian is therefore @xmath269 with eigenvalues @xmath270 , and the triplet bipolaron hamiltonian is @xmath271 with eigenvalues @xmath272 .",
    "( an alternative choice of basis would be the six - dimensional unsymmetrised @xmath273 basis @xmath274 .",
    "this would transform the triangle into a six - member ring .",
    "such a basis becomes unwieldy for typical lattices ) . clearly , the properties of the plaquette are defined by single polaron hopping events , since there are no eigenvalues with @xmath275 terms .",
    "it is this property which makes lattices which can be constructed from triangular plaquettes a good starting place when looking for small superlight bipolarons .",
    "let us consider a triangular lattice with nearest - neighbour hopping @xmath276 .",
    "in the anti - adiabatic approximation , this is replaced by @xmath215 .",
    "the polaron band structure ( ignoring polaron shift ) is @xmath277 , where we have defined @xmath278 @xmath279 being the lattice parameter .",
    "expanding near the @xmath280 point gives @xmath281 the polaron effective mass is therefore @xmath282        [ kagomefig ]    by placing a node on each bond in the lattice , we see that the resulting dimer lattice is a kagome lattice .",
    "the dispersion is easily found as follows ( see also ref @xcite ) by diagonalising the secular matrix @xmath283 with @xmath284 the sign in ( [ hkagome ] ) is @xmath285 for the singlet and @xmath286 for the triplet .",
    "there are three bipolaron bands with no gaps : @xmath287 with sign @xmath286 for the singlet and @xmath285 for the triplet .",
    "the lowest singlet band is @xmath288 with effective mass @xmath289 we notice that this increases _ linearly _ with the polaron mass , indicating that crab - like bipolarons can be relatively light .",
    "the lowest triplet band is the _ flat band _ @xmath290 .",
    "this implies that a triplet crab - like bipolaron has _ infinite _",
    "mass on a triangular lattice .",
    "once crawler motion is permitted , the effective mass is expected to be finite but proportional to @xmath291 .",
    "lattices with triangular components are not the only ones where the ability to move between degenerate paired states can be utilised to lead to small masses . for example , if we introduce next - nearest - neighbour hopping to a linear chain , then , in the anti - adiabatic approximation , we obtain a bipolaron mass , @xmath292 and a polaron mass @xmath293 where @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "while this does not lead to an exact cancellation of the exponents , the bipolaron to polaron mass ratio is linear in @xmath296 , and the bipolaron is therefore expected to be light .",
    "another suggestion for bipolarons with light mass comes from the cuprate lattice .",
    "it has often been suggested that the tight - binding structure of the cuprates is a square lattice with nearest - neighbour hopping @xmath276 and next - nearest - neighbour hopping @xmath297 . in the presence of very stong coulomb repulsion @xmath5",
    ", one may determine that the ground state of the lang - firsov transformed hamiltonian consists of nearest neighbour pairs with degeneracy four .",
    "if one applies the anti - adiabatic approximation to such a lattice , one determines that the hopping of such a bipolaron is first order in @xmath297 .",
    "we obtain a bipolaron mass , @xmath298 and a polaron mass @xmath293 where @xmath299 and @xmath300 . here",
    "@xmath301 is the rotation operator .",
    "again , while we do nt get an exact cancellation of the exponents , we obtain a resulting mass proportional to @xmath296 , and light bipolarons are likely . such pairing is an appealing prospect , especially since the hague has demonstrated the potential for d - wave superconductivity mediated by holstein - like electron - phonon interactions in the intermediate coupling limit @xcite .",
    "the bipolaronic extension @xcite of the bcs theory towards the strong interaction between electrons and ion vibrations proved that the cooper pairing in momentum space @xcite and the ogg - schafroth real - space pairing @xcite are two extreme limits of the same problem . for a very strong electron - phonon coupling , polarons become self - trapped on a single lattice site and bipolarons are on - site singlets . in the holstein model of the zero - range epi",
    "their mass appears only in the second order of polaron hopping @xcite , so that on - site bipolarons are very heavy .",
    "this estimate led some authors to the conclusion that the formation of itinerant small polarons and bipolarons in real materials is unlikely @xcite , and high - temperature bipolaronic superconductivity is impossible @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have demonstrated here that small but light bipolarons could exist for realistic values of the finite - range epi with high - frequency optical phonons in staggered ladder systems .",
    "small light bipolarons are an essential precursor to high - temperature superconductivity , since the bose - einstein condensate has transition temperature that is inversely proportional to mass , and wavefunctions may not overlap .",
    "such bipolarons are easily formed on lattices with triangular plaquettes in the presence of extremely large on - site coulomb repulsion , and persist to large epi .",
    "this conclusion is backed up by analytics in the anti - adiabatic approximation in the presence of large intersite coulomb attraction .",
    "another important conclusion is that the triplet - singlet exchange energy is of the first order in the hopping integral , and triplet bipolarons are heavier than singlets in certain lattice structures at variance with simple intuitive expectations .",
    "we summarise the types of lattices where light `` crab '' bipolarons may be formed in figure [ fig : pictorial ] , contrasting with the traditional holstein bipolarons ( bottom ) and describe the required effective interaction in figure [ fig : effinteraction ] demonstrating the underlying physics of such bipolarons .",
    "our ctqmc simulations lead us to believe that the following recipe is worth investigating to look for very high - temperature superconductivity : ( a ) the parent compound should be an ionic insulator with light ions to form high - frequency optical phonons , ( b ) the structure should be quasi two - dimensional to ensure poor screening of high - frequency c - axis polarized phonons , ( c ) a triangular lattice is required in combination with strong , on - site coulomb repulsion to form the small superlight crab bipolaron ( d ) moderate carrier densities are required to keep the system of small bipolarons close to the dilute regime . many of these conditions are already met in the cuprates .",

    "<S> recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has identified that a finite - range frhlich electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) with c - axis polarized optical phonons is important in cuprate superconductors , in agreement with an earlier proposal by alexandrov and kornilovitch . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated unscreened epi is so strong that it could easily transform doped holes into mobile lattice bipolarons in narrow - band mott insulators such as cuprates . applying a continuous - time quantum monte - carlo algorithm ( ctqmc ) we compute the total energy , effective mass , pair radius , number of phonons and isotope exponent of lattice bipolarons in the region of parameters where any approximation might fail taking into account the coulomb repulsion and the finite - range epi . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of modifying the interaction range and different lattice geometries are discussed with regards to analytical strong - coupling / non - adiabatic results . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that bipolarons can be simultaneously small and light , provided suitable conditions on the electron - phonon and electron - electron interaction are satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> such light small bipolarons are a necessary precursor to high - temperature bose - einstein condensation in solids . </S>",
    "<S> the light bipolaron mass is shown to be universal in systems made of triangular plaquettes , due to a novel crab - like motion . </S>",
    "<S> another surprising result is that the triplet - singlet exchange energy is of the first order in the hopping integral and triplet bipolarons are heavier than singlets in certain lattice structures at variance with intuitive expectations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we identify a range of lattices where superlight small bipolarons may be formed , and give estimates for their masses in the anti - adiabatic approximation . </S>"
