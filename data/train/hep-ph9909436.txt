    "the fermi coupling constant , @xmath1 , constitutes together with the electromagnetic coupling constant and the mass of the @xmath2 boson the most precise input parameters of the standard model of elementary particle physics .",
    "@xmath1 is defined through the muon lifetime , and the decay of the muon , as a purely leptonic process , is rather clean  both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the one - loop corrections of order @xmath3 were computed more than 40 years ago  @xcite whereas only recently the two - loop corrections of order @xmath4 have been evaluated  @xcite .",
    "the large gap in time shows that this calculation is highly non - trivial .",
    "the inclusion of the two - loop terms removed the relative theoretical error of @xmath5 which was an estimate on the size of the missing corrections .",
    "the remaining error on @xmath1 now reads @xmath6 and is of pure experimental nature .",
    "upcoming experiments will further improve the accuracy of the muon lifetime measurement and therefore the @xmath7 corrections to the muon decay are very important and constitute a crucial ingredient from the theoretical side .",
    "these facts make it desirable to have an independent check on the correctness of the @xmath8 result .",
    "we also want to mention that in a recent article  @xcite optimization methods have been used in order to estimate the coefficient of order @xmath9 .    in view of the upcoming @xmath10 physics experiments",
    "the evaluation of quantum corrections to @xmath10 meson properties have become topical . in particular",
    "it is possible to use the semileptonic decay rate of the bottom quark in order to determine the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements with quite some accuracy . in",
    "@xcite an approximate expression for the @xmath11 corrections of @xmath12 has been obtained where a non - vanishing charm quark mass has been included . in the decay @xmath13",
    "the mass of the @xmath14 quark can be neglected which reduces the calculation to the situation given in the muon decay .",
    "the only additional diagrams are those which arise due to the non - abelian structure of qcd .",
    "the results of order @xmath0 have been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the corrections proportional to the number of light quarks have already been computed in  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we confirm through an independent calculation the results of order @xmath4 to the muon decay  @xcite and the one of order @xmath0 to the semileptonic bottom quark decay  @xcite . in the next section our method",
    "is discussed , in section  [ sec : res ] the results are presented .",
    "in  @xcite the imaginary part of the muon propagator is computed up to the four - loop level .",
    "recurrence relations based on the integration - by - parts technique  @xcite are used in order to reduce the integrals to be evaluated to a minimal set  so - called master integrals .",
    "they are finally evaluated by computing expansions in the ratio of external momentum and internal muon mass .",
    "it is possible to take the on - shell limit and perform the infinite sum which finally leads to an exact result for the integrals . for concise reviews of expansion methods",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite our approach is based on an expansion of the full fermion propagator in the limit @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the external momentum and @xmath17 is the propagator mass of the muon and bottom quark , respectively .",
    "these diagrams are computed without any expansion . ] . throughout the whole paper",
    "we will neglect effects induced by the non - vanishing electron and up quark mass .",
    "the on - shell limit @xmath18 will be performed afterwards with the help of pad approximations .",
    "this , of course , only provides an approximation to the exact result .",
    "however , the integrals to be evaluated are simplified considerably .",
    "we will demonstrate that the accuracy obtained with our method is sufficient to check the existing results and enables the same reduction of the theoretical error on @xmath1 .",
    "the notation is essentially adopted from  @xcite , where corrections of @xmath11 to the decay @xmath19 have been computed . for completeness",
    "we briefly repeat in this paper the main formulae . the decay rate  both for the muon and the bottom quark  can be written in the form @xmath20\\bigg|_{z=1 } ,   \\label{eq : gam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 are functions of the variable @xmath22 @xmath17 is the on - shell mass . @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the scalar and vector part of the corresponding fermion propagator , respectively .",
    "they are functions of the external momentum @xmath16 and the bare mass @xmath25 of the fermion under consideration . in our case",
    "they further depend on the bare electromagnetic coupling @xmath26 and the strong coupling constant @xmath27 , respectively , and are proportional to the square of the fermi coupling constant , @xmath28 .",
    "the mass renormalization constant , @xmath29 , entering in  ( [ eq : sssv ] ) can be extracted from  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath30 has to be evaluated in the limit @xmath31 since the handling of @xmath30 is determined by the computation of the fermion propagator . as we are only interested in the imaginary part and furthermore consider only qed or qcd corrections to the leading order term the quantity @xmath30 has to be known up to two loops only .",
    "the result can be taken from  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath3 and @xmath32 proceeds in the usual way where we have chosen to renormalize also the electromagnetic coupling in a first step in the @xmath33 scheme .    in order to get reliable results",
    "it is necessary to compute as many terms as possible in the expansion parameter @xmath34 .",
    "subsequently a pad approximation is applied which is at length described in  @xcite . we just want to mention that before the pad procedure a conformal mapping can be used which maps the complex @xmath34-plane into the interiour of the unit circle . following ref .",
    "@xcite we denote those results by @xmath35-pads and the ones obtained without conformal mapping by @xmath34-pads .",
    "some pad approximants develop poles inside the unit circle ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively ) in conflict with the analycity of the exact result . in general",
    "we will discard such numbers in the following . in some cases",
    ", however , the pole coincides with a zero of the numerator up to several digits accuracy , and these pad approximations will be included in our sample . to be precise : in addition to the pad results without any poles inside the unit circle",
    ", we will use the ones where the poles are accompanied by zeros within a circle of radius 0.01 , and the distance between the pole and the physically relevant point @xmath38 is larger than 0.1 .",
    "the central values and the estimated uncertainty will be extracted from pad results @xmath39 $ ] with @xmath40 not too small and @xmath41 .",
    "the central value is obtained by averaging the pad results and the uncertainty is given by the maximal deviation from the central value .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the radiative corrections for the semileptonic bottom quark decay in the following form : @xmath42    \\ , ,    \\nonumber\\\\    a_b^{(2 ) } & = &    c_f^2 a_{b , a}^{(2 ) }    + c_a c_f a_{b , na}^{(2 ) }    + c_f t n_l a_{b , l}^{(2 ) }    + c_f t a_{b , f}^{(2 ) }    \\ , ,    \\label{eq : gamparb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 . for qcd",
    "the colour factors are given by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the number of massless quark flavours and will be set to @xmath48 at the end .",
    "@xmath49 corresponds to the abelian part already present in qed , @xmath50 represents the non - abelian contribution , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the corrections involving a second fermion loop with massless and heavy quarks , respectively . in principle",
    "there is also a contribution involving a virtual top quark loop .",
    "it is , however , suppressed by @xmath53 and will thus be neglected . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdec ] a representative diagram for each one of these four colour structures is pictured . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamparb ] ) @xmath54 is defined with five active flavours .",
    "the analytic result for @xmath55 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an analogous expression to  ( [ eq : gamparb ] ) can also be defined in the case of the muon decay @xmath56    \\ , ,    \\nonumber\\\\    a_\\mu^{(2 ) } & = &    a_{\\mu,\\gamma\\gamma}^{(2 ) }    + a_{\\mu , e}^{(2 ) }    + a_{\\mu,\\mu}^{(2 ) }    \\ , ,    \\label{eq : gamparmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 represents the electromagnetic coupling in the @xmath33 scheme .",
    "@xmath59 represents the purely photonic corrections whereas @xmath60 and @xmath61 contain an additional electron and muon loop , respectively .",
    "the contribution involving a virtual @xmath62 loop is not listed in  ( [ eq : gamparmu ] ) as it is suppressed by @xmath63 and almost four orders of magnitudes smaller than the other terms  @xcite .",
    "let us in the following describe our method used for the practical calculation in the case of the @xmath64 decay .",
    "the difference to the quark decay consists only in the transition from qed to qcd which increases the number of diagrams and makes it necessary to include the colour factors ; the idea is , however , applicable in the very same way .",
    "following common practice , we investigate the effective theory where the @xmath65 boson is integrated out . the qed corrections to the resulting fermi contact interaction",
    "were shown to be finite to all orders  @xcite .",
    "it is quite advantageous to perform a fierz transformation which for a pure @xmath66 theory has the consequence that afterwards the two neutrino lines appear in the same fermion trace .",
    "thus the qed corrections only affect the fermion trace involving the muon and the electron .",
    "this also provides some simplifications in the treatment to @xmath67 since in the case of vanishing electron mass a fully anticommuting prescription can be used .",
    "as described above we consider the fermion two - point functions and compute the imaginary part arising from the intermediate states with two neutrinos and the electron . as a consequence already for the born result a two - loop diagram has to be considered .",
    "however , it turns out that the loop integration connected to the two neutrino lines can be performed immediately as it constitutes a massless two - point function .",
    "this is also the case after allowing for additional photonic corrections .",
    "as a result one encounters in the resulting diagram a propagator with one of the momenta raised to power @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the space - time dimension .",
    "this slightly increases the difficulty of the computation of the resulting diagrams . especially for the order @xmath4 corrections , where the original four - loop diagrams are reduced to three - loop ones with non - integer powers of denominators , it is a priori not clear that these integrals can be solved analytically .",
    "however , it turns out that for the topologies needed in our case this is indeed possible . for the computation of the massless two - point functions we have used the package mincer  @xcite .",
    "slight modifications enabled us to use this package also for the computation of the new type of integrals .",
    "the calculation is performed with the help of the package geficom  @xcite .",
    "it uses qgraf  @xcite for the generation of the diagrams and exp  @xcite for the application of the asymptotic expansion procedures . for more technical details we refer to a recent review concerned with the automatic computation of feynman diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the dispersive and absorbtive part of the fermion self energies are gauge dependent for @xmath70 . hence the dependence on the gauge parameter @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gam ] ) only drops out after summing infinitely many terms in the expansion around @xmath72 and setting @xmath73 .",
    "since we are only dealing with a limited number of terms , our approximate results will still depend on the choice of @xmath71 even after taking @xmath74 .",
    "it is clear that with extreme values of @xmath71 almost any number could be produced .",
    "thus the question arises which value of @xmath71 should be taken in order to arrive at a reliable prediction for the decay rates . as the one - loop corrections can be evaluated for an arbitrary gauge parameter an extensive study can be performed and we can gain some hints for the choice of @xmath71 at order @xmath4 .",
    "let us in a first step present the results for the muon decay and afterwards discuss the additional diagrams necessary for the qcd corrections to the bottom quark decay .",
    "the lowest order ( born ) diagram can be computed directly . in this case",
    "the electron mass can be chosen different from zero and an expansion in @xmath75 can be performed reproducing the exact result @xmath76    we want to demonstrate the power of our method for the order @xmath3 corrections where four three - loop diagrams contribute . at this order",
    "we are able to evaluate a large number of moments which gives us a suggestion how many terms are necessary at @xmath7 in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "furthermore the computation can be performed for arbitrary gauge parameter which also provides some hints for the two - loop qed corrections .    applying the asymptotic expansion in the limit @xmath77 to the four three - loop diagrams contributing to the @xmath78 correction leads to the following result for the first nine expansion terms @xmath79    .[tab : oal]@xmath34-pad results for the @xmath78 corrections for different choices of @xmath71 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to get predictions for @xmath55 we again add the moments in a first step and perform the pad approximations afterwards . from the results listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : na_2 ] we deduce @xmath80 this number is in good agreement with the one stated in  @xcite .",
    "the error is quite small and amounts only to roughly 3% .",
    "the semileptonic decay rate of the bottom quark finally reads @xmath81    \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this paper the two - loop qed corrections to the decay rate of the muon have been evaluated .",
    "a new method has been used in order to confirm via an independent calculation the result of ref .",
    "@xcite . from the muon decay the fermi coupling constant , @xmath1 , is determined which constitutes one of the basic input parameters of the standard model .",
    "thus it is very important to have independent checks on such highly non - trivial computations .",
    "the inclusion of the new correction terms removes the theoretical error on @xmath1 .",
    "after the additional computation of the non - abelian diagrams the qcd corrections to the semileptonic decay rate of the bottom quark @xmath82 are obtained . again agreement with the literature  @xcite is found .",
