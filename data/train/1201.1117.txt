    "recent years have seen a rapid experimental development in multidimensional coherent spectroscopy . developed first in the nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite it has been brought to infra red @xcite and later into near infra - red and optical domains @xcite . since then it yielded new insights into photo - induced dynamics of electronic excited states of small molecules @xcite , polymers @xcite , large photosynthetic aggregates @xcite and even solid state systems @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fourier transformed spectrum completely characterizes the third order non - linear response of a molecular ensemble in amplitude and phase @xcite providing thus , the maximal information accessible in a three pulse experiment . in the three pulse degenerate four wave mixing ( fwm ) experiment @xcite , two independent adjustable parameters  the delays between the three pulses  allow experimentalists to address the time and delay dependent third order non - linear response of the molecular system @xmath1 via complete characterization of the third order non - linear signal @xmath2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fwm - experiment ] ) .",
    "this information is conveniently represented by a 2d plot of the fourier transformed signal @xmath3 which correlates the absorption frequency @xmath4 with the frequency @xmath5 of stimulated emission , ground state bleaching and excited state absorption contributions , separated from the absorption event by an adjustable waiting time @xmath6 .",
    "femtosecond photo - induced evolution of molecular systems is reflected in the amplitude , position and shape of 2d spectral features as functions of the waiting time revealing thus important information about the molecular structure , intramolecular dynamics , as well as the interaction of molecular electronic transitions with their environment @xcite .    by analyzing 2d spectra of photosynthetic fenna - mathews - olson ( fmo ) protein , brixner et al .",
    "have first demonstrated the ability of the new technique to improve our knowledge of energy transfer pathways in photosynthetic proteins @xcite .",
    "later , signatures of electronic quantum coherence in this system have been theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "the same measurements led to a surprising discovery of the long life time of these electronic coherence and to an identification of a host of other effects which contribute to the wave - like nature of the energy transfer in these systems . recently , coherent oscillations in 2d spectra of photosynthetic systems were demonstrated even for room temperature @xcite .",
    "the impact of these new finds has been felt well beyond the photosynthesis research community , and the quantum properties of energy transfer in biological systems have attracted researches from seemingly unrelated fields of quantum computation and quantum information science .",
    "questions about the relevance of quantum effects in natural light harvesting have led researches to study quantum entanglement @xcite , various aspects of the environmental assistance in quantum transport and optimality of transport processes @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , measurement of electronic coherence have found utility in determining structure - related properties of photosynthetic systems .",
    "thus , the electronic beating of 2d spectra have been recently used to precisely determine electronic energy levels in congested spectra of molecular aggregates @xcite .    in order to yield the above",
    "discussed impressive results , optical 2d experiments have to be accompanied by a thorough analysis , which requires detailed theoretical understanding of the molecular response to exciting light . for the description of the most 2d experiments ,",
    "the third order semi - classical light - matter interaction response function theory is well established .",
    "response functions of model few - level systems with pure dephasing ( i.e. with no energy transfer between the levels ) can even be expressed analytically in terms of the so - called _ _ energy gap correlation function _ _ ( egcf ) , using the second order cumulant in magnus expansion @xcite .",
    "some examples of small chromophores in solution fall in this category @xcite when investigated on time scales shorter then radiative life time . for a gaussian bath",
    "this analytical theory is exact , and thus knowing the egcf of the electronic transitions enables us to determine linear ( absorption ) as well as non - linear spectra .",
    "however , the construction of exact response functions for realistic energy transferring systems , such as frenkel excitons in photosynthetic aggregates @xcite , is no longer possible .",
    "photosynthetic complexes are relatively large , and the proper methods to simulate finite timescale stochastic fluctuations at finite temperatures @xcite carry a substantial numerical cost .",
    "practical calculations thus require some type of reduced dynamics where only electronic degrees of freedom ( dof ) are treated explicitly .",
    "these approaches usually rely on a host of approximations that seem to work well for most spectroscopic techniques @xcite and in systems where the details of system - bath coupling are apparently less important @xcite . with increasing details of the excited state dynamics revealed by the 2d spectroscopy @xcite and with increasing size of the studied systems ,",
    "it becomes more and more important to keep the numerical cost of simulations low , while simultaneously account for experimentally observed quantum effects .",
    "one of the possible research directions is to extend on existing reduced density matrix ( rdm ) theories @xcite or relax certain approximations @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that rdm master equations derived by projection operator technique reproduce exactly the linear response @xcite . in the case of higher order response functions",
    ", however , the same approach necessarily neglects bath correlations between the different periods of photo - induced system evolution ( i.e. between so - called coherence time @xmath0 and the waiting time @xmath6 ) .",
    "the failure to account for this correlation leads sometimes to a complete loss of the experimentally observed dynamics in simulated 2d spectra , such as in the case of the vibrational modulation of electronic 2d spectra @xcite . because vibrational modulation leads to effects similar to those attributed to electronic coherence ,",
    "developing methods that can account for its effect reliably in complex systems is of utmost importance .",
    "one possible approach to the problem is to derive equations of motion for the response as a whole , and to take the previous time evolution of the system into account explicitly @xcite . in this paper , we take a different route in which the correlation effects are treated by a specific choice of the projection operator .",
    "once a projector is specified , it can be used for any method of treating system bath interaction .",
    "we apply the previously suggested parametric projection operator technique @xcite to a calculation of the second order response of a quantum system .",
    "the second order response operators can be used to determine the state of a molecular system subject to excitation by a weak light with arbitrary properties , and thus its importance goes beyond the semi - classical system light interaction theory @xcite .",
    "alternatively , calculation of the second order response can be viewed as a first step towards more involved calculation of the third order response functions that is required for the modeling of the third order non - linear spectra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we specify the model hamiltonian and the description of the system s interaction with the light and its environment ( the thermodynamic bath ) . in section [ sec : multi - point - correlation - function ] we discuss the third order response functions of a multilevel systems , and we point out general limitations of their evaluation by the reduced density matrix master equations . in section [ sec : second - order - response ] we write out the density operator describing the excited state of a molecular system in terms of the second order response operator , and we discuss the advantages of usage of the parametric projection operator over the standard projectors .",
    "the details of the parametric projection operator and the corresponding master equation are introduced in section [ sec : reduced - density - matrix ] .",
    "numerical results for the excited state dynamics are then discussed in section [ sec : numerical - results - and ] . some definitions and calculation details",
    "can be found in the appendices .",
    "our primary interest lies in photosynthetic aggregates of chlorophylls .",
    "frenkel exciton model is well established for the description of photosynthetic systems and their spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the second order response , which we have in mind here , corresponds to the interaction of the excitonic system with first two pulses in a standard fwm spectroscopy ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fwm - experiment ] ) , and it should correspondingly describe the time evolution of the system in the excited or ground state .",
    "the part of the response associated with evolution in the excited state also corresponds to the material quantities that govern excitation of molecular systems by arbitrary quantum light @xcite .",
    "a scheme of a typical fwm experiment .",
    "three laser pulses with delays @xmath0 and @xmath6 are incident on a sample .",
    "a non - linear signal generated into a selected direction , @xmath7 here , is detected . ]    for a second order response we need to consider only single exciton band , i.e. the collective excited states of the aggregate with only a single aggregate member excited .",
    "the frenkel hamiltonian including environmental contributions has the general form @xmath8 where the purely electronic ( system ) hamiltonian @xmath9 reads @xmath10 @xmath11 the bath hamiltonian @xmath12 can be identified with @xmath13 and the system - bath interaction @xmath14 reads as @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the electronic ground state of the aggregate of molecules with energy @xmath17 , @xmath18 are electronic states with the @xmath19 molecule of the aggregate of @xmath20 molecules excited with energy @xmath21 , @xmath22 represents resonance coupling between excited states @xmath18 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 represents potential energy surfaces ( pes ) of the bath dof in corresponding electronic states , and @xmath6 is the kinetic energy of the bath dof .",
    "we also defined so - called energy gap operator @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the equilibrium quantum mechanical average over the bath dof .",
    "symbol @xmath27 denotes an arbitrary operator .",
    "the interaction of the system with light will be described by the usual semi - classical light - matter interaction term in dipole approximation @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the transition dipole moment operator of the aggregate system and @xmath30 is the electric field vector of the light with polarization vector @xmath31 .",
    "the states @xmath18 with excitations localized on individual member molecules of the aggregate allow us to define the properties of the aggregate based on crystal structure and quantum chemical inputs .",
    "it is , however , often more convenient to work in a basis of the eigenstate @xmath32 of the electronic hamiltonian @xmath9 . for",
    "later convenience we will define projection operators @xmath33 projecting on a state in the local basis and @xmath34 projecting on the eigenstate ( excitonic ) basis .",
    "for the discussion of the non - linear response functions , it is advantageous to use a superoperator formalism .",
    "we define the dipole moment superoperator as    @xmath35_{-}=\\frac{1}{\\hbar}[\\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{\\mu}}\\cdot\\bm{e},\\bullet]_{-},\\label{eq : vsup}\\ ] ]    and the liouvillian as @xmath36_{-}.\\label{eq : lsup}\\ ] ] we will also use the evolution operator @xmath37 and the evolution superoperator @xmath38 where convenient .    in the second order system - bath coupling theories , the energy gap operators , eq .",

    "the bath can consists of several types of collective modes which can be described by various types of bath correlation function .",
    "experimental situation is typically well described by one or several overdamped brownian oscillator modes standing for an macroscopic number of harmonic dof , and several underdamped oscillator modes standing for some important vibrational coordinates , e.g. normal modes of the chromophore molecules @xcite . both of these limits can be conveniently described by by the general brownian oscillator correlation function @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) which is a function of temperature @xmath6 , frequency @xmath46of the oscillator , damping coefficient @xmath47 and the reorganization energy @xmath48 . in the case of a strongly overdamped mode",

    "the block structure is enabled by the fact that the hamiltonian operators , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hs ] ) to ( [ eq : hsb ] ) , do not contain any terms that enable de - excitation of excited states .",
    "this is a well justified assumption in studies of ultra - fast dynamics of the chlorophyll based photosynthetic aggregates @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : system - light ] ) . the second order response , which is of interest in this paper , requires on the ground- and the single - exciton blocks .",
    "we will therefore use upper indices @xmath58 ( ground state ) and @xmath59 ( single exciton block ) to denote different blocks of operators and superoperators whenever we are interested in operations on and evolution of their individual blocks .",
    "thus , e.g. the time evolution of the system in excited state single exciton manifold is described by the rdm block @xmath60 , and the action of the dipole operator ( superoperator ) promotes the ground state block into a coherence block as @xmath61 .",
    "when working in a particular basis of states ( e.g. @xmath62 ) we can write out the sums over the states explicitly , e.g. as @xmath63 @xmath64 the rules are rooted in the simple well - known fact that matrices can be multiplied by blocks . when discussing the most common non - linear experiments , the block structure has to be considered up to the two - exciton block .",
    "non - linear response functions have in general the form of multi - point correlation functions . for a two band system ( ground state and single excitons ) , the third order non - linear spectroscopy is completely described by four response functions @xcite , listed in appendix [ sec : third - order - non - linear - response ] . as an example",

    "an alternative to the projector approach is to attempt to derive specific equations of motion for each response function as a whole in a specific perturbation scheme , e.g. second order convolutionless qme ( cl - qme ) as in ref .",
    "while both approaches should lead to similar results , the projection operator technique is not limited to any specific way of expanding the equations of motion in terms of system - bath coupling , and we believe it is therefore somewhat more flexible .",
    "the second order optical response can yield an optical signal on the sum or difference frequencies of the exciting field . here , we consider only the degenerate experiment when the excitation field have the same frequency , and we are interested in particular in the zero frequency part of the response which does not generate an optical signal . unlike in spectroscopy where we study a quantum mechanical expectation value ( polarization or field ) , here we would like to study the state of the system achieved by the excitation .",
