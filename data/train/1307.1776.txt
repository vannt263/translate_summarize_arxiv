    "a community of people where each person has a characteristic ( for example , an opinion on a particular subject and this opinion can be expressed in a binary form , in favor ( @xmath13 ) or against ( @xmath14 ) a particular issue in question , and this opinion can be influenced by the vicinity of this individual ) can be modeled using some simple models as the equilibrium ising model @xcite that has become an excellent tool to study models of social application @xcite .",
    "many works these nature are well described in a thorough review @xcite , a more recent summary by stauffer @xcite and the following papers in these special issues on sociophysics in this journal .",
    "the majority - vote model ( mvm ) of oliveira @xcite is a nonequilibrium model of social interaction : individuals of a certain population make their decisions based on the opinion of the majority of their neighbors .",
    "this model has been studied for several years by various researchers in order to model social and economic systems @xcite in regular structures @xcite and various other complex networks @xcite .",
    "there are also applications to real elections in which similar models of opinion dynamics have been explored in the literature , such as arajo _",
    "_ @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the critical properties of mvm with random noise on a square lattice @xmath15 . here , we start with each individual or agent having their characteristic noise @xmath16 randomly selected within a range from 0 to @xmath0 .",
    "thus each agent does not have an opinion in the presence of a constant noise @xmath0 as in the traditional mvm @xcite , but instead each agent has intrinsic resistance , @xmath16 , to the opinion of their neighborhood on @xmath15 .",
    "the effective dimension using the exponents ratio @xmath2 and @xmath3 is also determined for mvm with random noise .",
    "finally , the critical exponents calculated for this model are compared with the results obtained by oliveira @xcite .",
    "in the mvm on @xmath15 , the system dynamics traditional is as follows .",
    "initially , we assign a spin variable @xmath17 with values @xmath18 at each node of the lattice . at each step",
    "we try to spin flip a node .",
    "the flip is accepted with probability @xmath19 , \\label{eq_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the sign @xmath18 of @xmath21 if @xmath22 , @xmath23 if @xmath24 . to calculate @xmath25 our sum runs over the @xmath26 nearest neighbors of spin @xmath27 on square lattice .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) means that with probability @xmath28 the spin will adopt the same state as the majority of its neighbors .",
    "the control parameter @xmath29 plays a role similar to the temperature in equilibrium systems : the smaller @xmath0 , the greater the probability of parallel aligning with the local majority .    here , in order to make the model more realistic in a social context we associate to each agent its characteristic noise _ @xmath16_. thus the agent has not only opinion , but also an individual resistance to the opinion of this neighborhood .",
    "therefore , the new rate of reversal of the spin variable is @xmath30 , \\label{eq_2}\\ ] ] where the noise parameter _ @xmath16 _ , associated with the site @xmath27 , satisfies the probability distribution @xmath31 and takes real values randomly in the interval [ 0 , q ] .    to study the critical behavior of the model we define the variable @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the magnetization @xmath34 , susceptibility @xmath35 and the reduced fourth - order cumulant @xmath36    [ eq - def ] @xmath37",
    "@xmath38 @xmath39    where @xmath40 stands for a thermodynamic average . the results are averaged over the @xmath41 independent simulations .",
    "these quantities are functions of the noise parameter @xmath0 and obey the finite - size scaling relations    [ eq - scal ] @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the usual critical exponents , @xmath48 are the finite size scaling functions with @xmath49    being the scaling variable .",
    "therefore , from the size dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 we obtained the exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the maximum value of susceptibility also scales as @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath51 for which @xmath35 has a maximum is expected to scale with the lattice size @xmath52 as @xmath53    therefore , the relations and may be used to get the exponent @xmath4 .",
    "we also have applied the calculated exponents to the hyperscaling hypothesis @xmath54 in order to get the effective dimensionality , @xmath55 , and to improve the @xmath2 and @xmath3 exponents ratio for @xmath56 on @xmath15 .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulation on @xmath15 with various lattice sizes @xmath52 ( 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 and 1000 ) .",
    "we took @xmath57 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) to make the system reach the steady state , and then the time averages are estimated over the next @xmath57 mcs .",
    "one mcs is accomplished after all the @xmath58 spins are investigated whether they flip or not .",
    "the results are averaged over @xmath41 @xmath59 independent simulation runs for each lattice size and for given set of parameters @xmath60 .",
    "in figs .  [ f1 ] ,  [ f2 ] , and  [ f3 ] we show the dependence of the magnetization @xmath34 , susceptibility @xmath35 , and binder cumulant @xmath36 on the noise parameter @xmath0 , obtained from simulations on @xmath15 with @xmath52 ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath62 lattice size ( @xmath63 to @xmath64 sites ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 curve , for a given value of @xmath52 , suggests the presence of a second - order phase transition in the system .",
    "the phase transition occurs at the critical value @xmath68 of the noise parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter @xmath68 is estimated as the point where the @xmath69 curves for different lattice sizes @xmath52 intercept each other @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we plot the dependence of the magnetization @xmath70 vs. the lattice size @xmath52 .",
    "the slope of curve corresponds to the exponent ratio @xmath2 according to eq .",
    "the obtained exponent is @xmath71 for our @xmath15 .",
    "the exponent ratio @xmath3 at @xmath5 and @xmath72 is obtained from the slope of the straight line with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively as presented in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] for @xmath15 .    to obtain the critical exponent @xmath4",
    ", we used the scaling relation ( 6 ) .",
    "the calculated value of the exponent @xmath4 are @xmath9 for @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "we plot @xmath75 versus @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] using the critical exponents @xmath77 and @xmath7 for lattice size @xmath78,@xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath62 for @xmath15",
    ". the good collapse of the curves for five different lattice sizes corroborates the estimate for @xmath68 and the critical exponents @xmath2 and @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] we plot @xmath81 versus @xmath76 using the critical exponents @xmath82 and @xmath9 for lattice size @xmath78 , 400 , 500 , and 1000 for @xmath15 .",
    "again , the good collapse of the curves for five different lattice size corroborates the extimation for @xmath68 and the critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we remark that our mc results obtained on @xmath15 for mvm with random noise show that critical exponent ratios @xmath7 and @xmath82 are different from the results of mvm for regular lattice @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite and equilibrium 2d ising model @xcite . on the other hand , we show also that the critical exponent @xmath9 and binder cumulant @xmath11 are similar to the mvm for regular lattice @xcite .",
    "we also showed that the effective dimension @xmath55 ( within error bars ) is close to @xmath85 .",
    "the agreement in @xmath55 and @xmath4 but not in the two exponent ratios @xmath2 and @xmath3 remains to be explained .",
