    "despite the tremendous experimental and theoretical efforts of recent years , the synthesis of the so called p  nuclei ( the heavy , proton - rich isotopes which can not be synthesized by neutron capture reactions in the s- or r - process ) is still one of the least known processes of nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is generally accepted that the synthesis of the p ",
    "nuclei , the astrophysical p ",
    "process , involves mainly @xmath2-induced reactions on abundant seed nuclei produced at earlier stages of nucleosynthesis by the s- ( or to less extent the r- ) process @xcite . during the p - process flow , material from the bottom of the valley of stability",
    "is driven to the proton rich side by subsequent ( @xmath2,n ) reactions .",
    "as the neutron separation energy increases while the charged - particle separation energies decrease along this path , charged - particle emitting ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath2,p ) reactions become increasingly important for more proton - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "they can modify significantly the final abundance distribution of p - nuclei by feeding isotopic chains with lower charge number @xmath8 .",
    "high energy photons with sufficient energy for dominating photodisintegration appear only in explosive nucleosynthetic scenarios .",
    "the generally accepted models locate the p - process in the deep one - rich layers of massive stars either in their pre - supernova or supernova phases where temperatures of a few times 10@xmath9  k are reached .",
    "comprehensive modeling of the p - process requires on one hand detailed information on the stellar environment ( temperature , original seed abundances , burning time scale , etc . ) , on the other hand nuclear physics also plays an important role . in p - process",
    "modeling the reaction rates of hundreds of nuclear reactions involved in nuclear reaction networks must be known .",
    "all the reaction rates including the dominant @xmath2-induced reactions are generally calculated with hauser - feshbach type statistical models .",
    "the rates of @xmath2-induced reactions can be calculated from the inverse capture reactions using the detailed balance theorem if the cross sections of the capture reactions are known experimentally .",
    "while there are compilations for the ( n,@xmath2 ) cross sections , very few charged particle induced reactions above the iron region have been investigated experimentally , leaving the statistical model calculations largely untested .    realizing the need for testing experimentally the statistical model calculations in the region of proton rich nuclei , several ( p,@xmath2 ) and a few ( @xmath10 ) reaction cross sections have been measured in recent years and the results",
    "have been compared with model predictions ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite and references therein , and the kadonis database @xcite ) . in general , the models are able to reproduce the experimental results within about a factor of two , however , some larger deviations are also found .",
    "the existing experimental database is still not sufficient to check the reliability of model calculations globally , therefore further experimental data are highly needed .",
    "recently , the ( @xmath10 ) as well as the ( @xmath11,n ) and ( @xmath11,p ) cross sections of @xmath1cd have been measured in the energy range relevant to the p - process and compared to statistical model calculations @xcite .",
    "an experiment is also in progress to obtain more information on the important @xmath11+nucleus optical potential via ( @xmath11,@xmath11 ) scattering on @xmath1cd ; preliminary results are already available @xcite . to give a complete description of @xmath1cd from the astrophysical p - process point of view , the measurement of its proton capture cross section is also necessary .    in the present work",
    "the proton capture cross sections of @xmath1cd and @xmath4cd ( the other p - isotope of cadmium ) have been measured .",
    "a temperature window of @xmath12k for the astrophysical reaction rates can be covered by our measured energy range .",
    "this accommodates well the temperatures relevant for the p - process .",
    "consequently , the results can be compared with model predictions right at the astrophysically relevant energies , no extrapolations are necessary .",
    "cadmium has 8 stable isotopes with mass numbers 106 , 108 , 110 , 111 , 112 , 113 , 114 and 116 .",
    "the two lightest isotopes @xmath1cd and @xmath4cd are p - isotopes with low natural abundances of 1.25% and 0.89% , respectively .",
    "proton - capture on these two isotopes leads to unstable in isotopes ( @xmath3 in and @xmath5 in ) which decay by @xmath13 or electron capture to @xmath3cd and @xmath5cd , respectively . for both isotopes the @xmath6-decay",
    "is followed by @xmath2-radiation which makes it possible to determine the proton - capture cross section using the activation method with @xmath2-detection . in this method cd targets",
    "are irradiated by a proton beam and the capture cross section is derived from the off - line measurement of the decay of reaction products .",
    "table 1 shows the decay parameters of the two residual in isotopes .",
    "note that only the strongest @xmath2-radiations following the @xmath6-decay of the reaction products are listed .    cccc product nucleus & half life & gamma energy [ kev ] & relative intensity + & [ hour ] & & per decay [ % ] + @xmath3 in & 0.540 @xmath14 0.005 & 204.96 & 47.2 @xmath14 0.3 + @xmath5 in & 4.168 @xmath14 0.018 & 203.50 & 73.5",
    "@xmath14 0.5 +    owing to the different decay patterns of the two reaction products , it is possible to measure both cross sections in a single activation experiment provided the target contains both @xmath1cd and @xmath4cd isotopes .",
    "cadmium targets of natural isotopic abundance could in principle be appropriate for the cross section determination .",
    "proton induced reactions on the heavier cd isotopes , however , can be disturbing if they also lead to off - line @xmath2-radiation . in the astrophysically relevant low energy region",
    "the cross sections of the two investigated capture reactions are very low , thus the elimination of any disturbing @xmath2-radiation from the spectra is highly needed .",
    "such disturbing @xmath2-radiation can come e.g. from the @xmath15cd(p,@xmath2)@xmath16 in or @xmath17cd(p , n)@xmath17 in reactions , etc .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid the disturbing activity produced by heavier cd isotopes , enriched targets were used in the lower energy region where the cross section and consequently the yield of the studied reactions is very low .    both produced in isotopes have metastable states .",
    "the proton capture on cd can populate the ground as well as the metastable states in in . in the case of both isotopes , however , the metastable states decay exclusively by internal transition to the ground state . moreover , the half - lives of the metastable states are short ( 54.6s for @xmath18 in @xcite and 1.34 m for @xmath19 in @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "after a suitable cooling time between the end of the irradiation and the beginning of the @xmath2-counting , the metastable states have decayed completely to the grounds states and hence the measurement of the ground state decay provides information about the total capture cross section .",
    "the experimental setup was similar to the one used for our previous se(p,@xmath2 ) experiment @xcite , and described in details in a preliminary report on cd(p,@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "shortly , thin cd targets have been irradiated with proton beams from both the van de graaff and cyclotron accelerators of the atomki .",
    "the targets were prepared by evaporating natural or highly enriched ( enrichment in @xmath1cd is 96.47% ) metallic cd onto thin al backing .",
    "the thickness of the targets has been measured by weighing . the energy range from e@xmath0=2.4 to 4.7mev",
    "was covered in 200kev steps using the van de graaff accelerator in the lower and the cyclotron in the upper part of the energy range .",
    "each irradiation lasted about 10 hours with a beam current of 500na and the target stability was monitored by detecting the backscattered protons from the cd target .",
    "table [ tab : irrad ] shows the summary of the irradiations and the list of used targets .",
    "note that the targets enriched in @xmath1cd contained 2.05% @xmath4cd , still higher than the natural abundance of @xmath4cd ( 0.89% ) .    cccr@@xmath14lc beam energy & accelerator & target type & & energy loss in target + [ kev ] & & & & [ kev ] + 2.400 & van de graaff & enriched & 595 & 42 & 36.6 + 2.600 & van de graaff & enriched & 100 & 7 & 5.9 + 2.800 & van de graaff & enriched & 165 & 12 & 9.3 + 2.952 & cyclotron & enriched & 436 & 31 & 23.7 + 3.000 & van de graaff & natural & 160 & 11 & 8.1 + 3.200 & van de graaff & natural & 178 & 12 & 8.7 + 3.200 & van de graaff & enriched & 100 & 7 & 5.2 + 3.400 & van de graaff & natural & 160 & 11 & 7.5 + 3.545 & cyclotron & enriched & 436 & 31 & 21.2 + 3.600 & van de graaff & natural & 178 & 12 & 8.1 + 3.744 & cyclotron & enriched & 146 & 10 & 6.8 + 3.942 & cyclotron & natural & 290 & 20 & 12.5 + 4.140 & cyclotron & natural & 246 & 17 & 10.3 + 4.338 & cyclotron & natural & 246 & 17 & 10.0 + 4.536 & cyclotron & natural & 290 & 20 & 11.4 + 4.723 & cyclotron & natural & 246 & 17 & 9.4 + 4.723 & cyclotron & enriched & 146 & 10 & 5.9 +    the induced @xmath2-activity of the targets has been measured with a calibrated hpge detector equipped with 5 cm thick lead shielding . the @xmath2-spectra",

    "there is also good agreement in the case of @xmath4cd(p,@xmath2)@xmath5 in for energies above 3.5 mev whereas there seems to be a slight systematic underprediction below that energy .",
    "however , it is still well within the usual 30% error which has to be assigned to the global model @xcite .",
    "although it appears as if the data are systematically higher below 3.5 mev in the case of @xmath4cd , no correlation with either the used targets or the accelerator type was found in a closer inspection of table [ tab : irrad ] .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : res106 ] and [ fig : res108 ] one might imply that the energy - dependence of the theoretical s - factor may be slightly too flat . a stronger increase towards lower energies",
    "would accommodate the measurements well for both reactions .",
    "the calculated cross sections and s - factors are mainly dependent on the proton- and @xmath2-strengths . in order to study the sensitivity",
    "we have performed calculations to study the impact of a variation of the strengths by a factor of two .",
    "the result is shown in figs.[fig : sens106 ] and [ fig : sens108 ] .",
    "the plotted sensitivity can assume values between 0 and 1 , ranging from no impact to a full factor of two change in the cross section and s - factor .",
    "it can be seen that the s - factors of both reactions are more sensitive to the proton strengths than the @xmath2-strengths across the given energy range .",
    "this may appear surprising at first glance but it has to be realized that the proton widths are smaller than the @xmath2-widths due to the coulomb suppression at such low energies .",
    "consequently , a change in the nuclear properties determining the @xmath2-strength would only have a limited impact and only at the high end of the measured range .",
    "the impact would be larger for @xmath4cd(p,@xmath2)@xmath5 in than for the other reaction .",
    "the e1 gdr strength function and the nuclear level density in the compound nucleus determine the @xmath2-strength whereas the main property for the proton width is the optical potential for protons .",
    "the standard calculation shown here uses e1 and m1 transmission coefficients as described in @xcite ( additionally , e2 transitions were considered but they do not contribute significantly here ) , the nuclear level density of @xcite , and the microscopic proton potential of @xcite with low - energy modifications as described in @xcite . however , since there is reasonable reproduction of the data within the quoted errors it is impossible to make a case for a required modification of any of these properties .",
    "the central quantity important for the application in astrophysical models is the astrophysical reaction rate obtained by folding the cross sections with the temperature dependent maxwell - boltzmann distribution of projectile energies . because of the limited energy range of the data",
    ", the relevant integration can only be performed for a limited number of temperatures when adopting an upper limit for the error in the integration due to the energy cutoff . for the derivation of the astrophysical reaction rates from the data",
    ", we used the code exp2rate @xcite which automatically determines the possible temperature window and also accounts for the experimental error bars . allowing for an error of at most 15% , we find that the covered temperature range is @xmath22k for @xmath1cd(p,@xmath2)@xmath3 in and @xmath12k for @xmath4cd(p,@xmath2)@xmath5 in .",
    "this covers well the relevant p - process temperature range which is usually given as @xmath23k @xcite . the resulting rates with their experimental errors are given in tables [ tab : rates106 ] and [ tab : rates108 ] .",

    "this is due to the fact that the calculation of the astrophysical reaction rate involves a weighted average across an appropriate energy range and tends to cancel small deviations .",
    "finally , a further effect has to be considered under astrophysical conditions . while the target nuclei are always in their ground states in a laboratory experiment , nuclei in astrophysical plasmas can be thermally excited according to the temperature",
