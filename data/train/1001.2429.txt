    "to study how dimensionally reduced fermions and yukawa couplings emerge in these models , we first consider the simplest non - trivial example of @xmath88 . represent the dirac operator for a fermion with unit charge in the presence of a magnetic monopole on @xmath88 of charge @xmath90 by @xmath192 .",

    "in addition , for the special value @xmath202 when @xmath203 , there are @xmath204 zero modes : for @xmath205 there are @xmath90 negative chirality modes , which we denote by @xmath206 while for @xmath207 there are @xmath204 positive chirality modes , @xmath208 for a given monopole charge , the index of the dirac operator is @xmath209    the dirac operator on @xmath210 splits up into the direct sum of 4-dimensional and 2-dimensional dirac operators @xmath211 at first sight zero modes of the dirac operator on @xmath88 might be expected to manifest themselves as massless fermions for the dirac operator on @xmath30 , but we shall see below that this is not always the case .",
    "after dimensional reduction a fermion on @xmath210 , e.g. in the fundamental of @xmath92 , will decompose as @xmath212 where the @xmath213 signs refer to the @xmath88 chirality , not 4-dimensional or 6-dimensional chirality .",
    "indeed @xmath214 itself could be either dirac or weyl in 6-dimensions . in the equivariant dimensional reduction framework",
    "only zero modes on @xmath88 are compatible with @xmath24 symmetry : @xmath215 correspond to higher harmonics which do not have this symmetry and correspond to 4-dimensional fermions with masses of order @xmath216 .",
    "focusing on zero modes , the 6-dimensional fermions @xmath217 decompose as @xmath218 where @xmath219 and @xmath220 are either dirac spinors in 4-dimensions , if @xmath214 is dirac in 6-dimensions , or weyl spinors of opposite chirality , if @xmath214 is weyl in 6-dimensions .",
    "not all of the 4-dimensional fermions @xmath219 and @xmath220 are massless however  @xcite . in 6 dimensions the dirac operator involves the 6-dimensional gauge field , which includes the higgs field after dimensional reduction , and these induce 4-dimensional yukawa couplings , allowing for the possibility of generating mass terms for 4-dimensional fermions through dynamical symmetry breaking . if , and only if , @xmath221 is odd there is a @xmath35-dimensional yukawa coupling linking @xmath222 to @xmath223 through @xmath224 for the example in  [ threetwoone ] , @xmath225 , we had @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath110",
    ". in this case @xmath222 transforms as @xmath226 under @xmath149 , @xmath223 as @xmath227 , and @xmath228 as @xmath226 .",
    "these 4-dimensional fermions pick up a mass @xmath229 via the higgs vacuum expectation value , which is of the same order as the masses of the higher harmonic fermions arising from non - zero eigenvalues of the dirac operator on @xmath88 and therefore should be removed from consideration if we are assuming higher harmonics are too heavy to be relevant to the physics at low energies .",
    "the issue of fermions on @xmath162 is complicated because there is a topological obstruction to the existence of a spin structure : due to the fact that the second stiefel - whitney class is non - vanishing  @xcite there is a global obstruction to defining spinors on @xmath232 for even @xmath233 .",
    "nevertheless , fermions can be defined by coupling them to monopoles and/or instantons ( spin@xmath234 structures ) . the full spectrum of the twisted dirac operator is complicated but for equivariant dimensional reduction we only need the zero modes . for fermions coupling to an equivariant monopole of magnetic charge @xmath221 and an equivariant instanton of topological charge @xmath233 , the index of the dirac operator on @xmath162 is  @xcite @xmath235 the fact that this is not an integer if @xmath233 and @xmath221 have the same parity , i.e. they are either both even or both odd ( e.g. @xmath236 ) , is related to the lack of spin structure on @xmath162 . under the embedding @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath233 and @xmath221",
    "always have the same parity , so any equivariant monopole / instanton background arising from the embedding will not admit global spinors .",
    "we therefore allow for a further twist with a monopole of charge @xmath239 ( @xmath240 odd ) and the index for this twisted gauge field configuration is @xmath241 we shall denote the positive and negative chirality zero modes of this operator , with a given fixed @xmath242 , by @xmath243 and @xmath244 respectively ( for notational clarity the degeneracy is not indicated ) .",
    "for @xmath245 we have @xmath246 , and choosing for example @xmath247 results in @xmath248 for example , the case @xmath128 with @xmath249 gives a single @xmath178 higgs matrix and the symmetry reduction scheme @xmath250 with @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 are the only zero modes giving the equivariant decomposition @xmath254 where @xmath255 and @xmath256 are either 4-dimensional dirac spinors on @xmath30 , if @xmath214 is dirac in 8-dimensions , or chiral spinors of opposite chirality in 4-dimensions , if @xmath214 is chiral in 8-dimensions .",
    "the induced 4-dimensional yukawa couplings generate a mass term for these spinors given by @xmath257    a different choice of @xmath242 leads to a different conclusion . taking @xmath258 results in @xmath259",
    "there is no analogue of @xmath255 in this case and yukawa couplings can not generate a mass term in 4-dimensions .",
    "starting from the adjoint representation @xmath260 consider the symmetry breaking scheme @xmath261 choosing , for example , @xmath262 gives @xmath263 in this case yukawa couplings generate a mass coupling the 4-dimensional spinors @xmath264 and @xmath265 , but the 8 flavours @xmath266 remain massless .",
    "we have shown that equivariant dimensional reduction with a simple gauge group @xmath26 gives the following :    * gauge symmetry reduction @xmath267 with only one gauge coupling in 4-dimensions , even if @xmath31 is semi - simple . * further dynamical symmetry breaking @xmath268 where the vacuum and symmetry breaking patterns , including higgs and gauge boson masses and weinberg angles ,",
    "can be deduced uniquely from group theory and induced representation theory . * in certain cases the vacuum configuration is related to gauge dynamics on the quiver lattice : the higgs vacuum corresponds to zero flux on the quiver lattice .",
    "* when fermions are included , chiral theories with families emerge naturally from non - trivial fluxes on  @xmath18 .",
    "* chiral fermions on @xmath93 do not allow direct mass terms , but yukawa couplings can give 4-dimensional masses to some of the resulting fermions on @xmath30 .",
    "yukawa couplings can even give masses to some , but not all , zero modes .",
    "the gauge and fermion structure of equivariant dimensionally reduced field theories is clearly very rich .",
    "standard model type yukawa couplings , with different chiralities belonging to different irreducible representations of the gauge group , arise quite naturally in the models presented here , but an exhaustive analysis of all possibilities would be an ambitious programme and remains to be tackled .",
