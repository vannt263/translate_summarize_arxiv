    "evolution can be probed in our galaxy through a detailed study of stellar populations , and in particular the large program on vlt - uves ( e.g. cayrel et al 2004 ) has unveiled suprising characteristics of the most metal - poor stars , which are certainly the oldest in the galaxy .",
    "there is very little variations of relative abundances [ x / fe ] , implying a good mixing of old stars ( franois et al 2004 ) .",
    "the n and n / o ratios , compatible with those found in dla systems , could come either from the first sne ii or from massive agb stars ( and well before any enrichment through sne ia , spite et al 2005 ) .",
    "the constraints given by the abundances , and the ionization epoch tend to imply that the first imf was top - heavy , and there were no small - mass pop iii stars .",
    "discrepant results on cu , co and zn abundances put into questions the yields ( implying for instance asymmetric supernovae explosions , e.g. prantzos 2005 ) .    a new unbiased survey of 14 000 f & g dwarfs in the solar neighborhood , with age , metallicity and kinemactical parameters , has shown that there is no age - metallicity relation , with a large z - scatter , for all ages except the very young ( nordstrm et al 2004 ) .",
    "the survey confirms the g - dwarf problem , and the radial gradient of metallicity , for young stars ( @xmath2 10 gyr ) .",
    "the confirmed age - velocity dispersion relation is explained by the scattering from gmc and spiral arms . from this survey ,",
    "helmi et al ( 2005 ) have identified a lot of structures in the solar neighborhood , most of them coming from spiral arms , bar , etc .. and some coming from tidal debris .",
    "many tidal debris and streams have been recently discovered in the stellar halo , suggesting that it could have been entirely formed from accreted satellites ( e.g. ibata et al 2003 ) .",
    "the same situation has been found around m31 ( ibata et al 2004 ) . the streams from sgra dw could serve to determine the flattening of the dark matter halo , at least those which are old enough ( helmi 2004 ) .",
    "willman et al ( 2005 ) have found recently another very weak possible satellite in ursa major , much weaker than sextans or any other dwarfs .",
    "after the successful model of 4-arm spiral pattern ( georgelin & georgelin 1976 ) some more precision about spiral arms is found by russeil et al ( 2005 ) . the central bar - bulge ( and may be secondary bar ?",
    "alard 2001 ) has been explored in details with the 2mass survey ( cf figure 1 , and lopez - corredoira et al 2005 ) .     pc . from lopez - corredoira",
    "et al ( 2005 ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    our galaxy is a privileged example to study central black holes in galaxies , through proper motions ( schdel et al 2003 , ghez et al 2005 ) .",
    "flares have been observed in near - infrared , that could be emitted by matter on the last stable orbit around the black hole , and could reveal its rotation ( genzel et al 2003 ) .",
    "more stellar tracers of the kinematics in the outer halo of the milky way have recently been obtained by battaglia et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion declines from 120 km / s to 50 km / s , from 30 kpc to about 120 kpc , which puts constraints on the density profile and total mass of the dark matter .",
    "these depend on the velocity anisotropy assumed , but an isothermal profile is now excluded , and the total mass somewhat reduced ( cf figure 2 , battaglia et al 2005 ) .        as for the local dark matter , grenier et al ( 2005 )",
    "have recently found evidence for a large amount of dark cold gas , which could be in the form of molecular hydrogen .",
    "this result is based on the observation of energetic gamma - rays diffuse emission , resulting from the interaction between nucleons and cosmic rays .",
    "the emission is associated to excess extinction , around known interstellar clouds .",
    "most of it was previously attributed to point sources ( pulsars ) , associated to local clouds , which have never been confirmed .",
    "the milky way is not the ideal galaxy to constrain the amount and radial distribution of the dark matter , since the inner regions are completely dominated by visible matter .",
    "models by klypin et al ( 2002 ) already succeeded to find reasonable fits , with more or less baryons or dark matter in the center , according to the amount of angular momentum lost by baryons against the cdm halo .",
    "but the dark matter never dominates in the central parts , and there must exist dark baryons within the virial radius of the halo .",
    "recently cardone & sereno ( 2005 ) built a larger range of models , with the hypothesis of adiabatic contraction , varying the parameters of the dm distribution .",
    "their best fit corresponds to much lower concentration of dark matter profiles .",
    "the chemical evolution observed in the stellar populations , together with other constraints , have allowed to reconstruct the star formation history of the milky way .",
    "for instance , in the disk , the star formation rate ( sfr ) has remained relatively constant , or is even increasing ( haywood et al 1997 ) .",
    "abundance problems ( such as the g - dwarf problem ) require large infall of external gas to dilute enrichment ( casuso & beckman 2004 ) .",
    "naab & ostriker ( 2005 ) have tried to reproduce the star formation history all across the hubble time , assuming that the halo assembles through hierarchical merging of subhalos until 2.5 gyr , and then the disk is forming inside out , by only quiescent accretion of gas . adopting a simple schmidt law with threshold for the sfr ,",
    "the resulting model fits the metallicity and mean age distribution of the galaxy , with an sfr peaking about 4 gyr ago .",
