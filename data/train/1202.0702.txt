    "quasi - cyclic ( qc ) codes have been a challenging and ongoing research subject in algebraic coding theory since their introduction in late 1960 s [ 1 ] .",
    "these codes asymptotically achieve the varshamov - gilbert bound [ 2 ] .",
    "recent research of these codes has been focused on a subclass of these codes , known as qc low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes .",
    "ldpc codes were first discovered by gallager in 1962 [ 3 ] and then rediscovered in late 1990 s [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] . ever since their rediscovery , a great deal of research effort has been expended in design , construction , structural and performance analysis , encoding , decoding , generalizations , and applications of ldpc codes .",
    "they have been shown to achieve the shannon capacities for a wide range of channels with iterative decoding based on belief propagation .",
    "major methods for constructing ldpc codes can be divided into two general categories , graph - theoretic based and algebraic methods .",
    "each type of constructions has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of overall performance , encoding and decoding implementations . in general , algebraically constructed ldpc codes have lower error - floors and their decoding using iterative message - passing algorithms , such as the sum - product algorithm ( spa ) and the min - sum algorithm ( msa ) converge faster than the ldpc codes of the length and rates constructed using the graph - theoretic - based methods .",
    "furthermore , it is much easier to construct algebraic ldpc codes with large minimum distances .",
    "algebraic constructions of ldpc codes are mainly based on finite fields , finite geometries , and combinatorial designs .",
    "these constructions result in mostly qc - ldpc codes .",
    "qc - ldpc codes have advantages over other types of ldpc codes in hardware implementation of encoding and decoding .",
    "encoding of a qc - ldpc code can be efficiently implemented using simple shift registers with complexity linearly proportional to its number of parity - check symbols ( or its length ) [ 6 ] . in hardware implementation of its decoder ,",
    "the quasi - cyclic structure of the code ( or circular structure of its parity - check matrix ) simplifies the wire routing for message passing [ 7 ] and allows partially parallel decoding [ 8 ] which offers a tradeoff between decoding complexity and decoding speed .",
    "furthermore , well designed or constructed qc - ldpc code can perform as well as any other types of ldpc codes .",
    "most of ldpc codes adopted as standard codes for various next generations of communication systems are qc - ldpc codes .",
    "a @xmath0-ary qc - ldpc code is given by the null space of an array @xmath1 of sparse _ circulant _ matrices ( or simply circulants ) of the same size over the field gf(@xmath0 ) where @xmath2 is a power of prime .",
    "if the array @xmath1 , viewed as a matrix , has constant column weight @xmath3 and constant row weight @xmath4 , the code given by the null space of @xmath1 is said to be ( @xmath5,@xmath6)-regular , otherwise it is said to be irregular .    in almost all of the proposed constructions of ldpc codes , the following constraint on the rows and columns of the parity - check matrix @xmath7 is imposed : _ no two rows ( or two columns ) can have more than one place where they both have identical non - zero components_. this constraint on the rows and columns of @xmath1 is referred to as the _ row - column ( rc)-constraint_. this rc - constraint ensures that the tanner graph [ 9 ] of the ldpc code given by the null space of @xmath1 has a girth of at least 6 and that the minimum distance of the code , if ( @xmath5,@xmath4)-regular , is at least @xmath8 [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .",
    "the distance bound is tight for regular ldpc codes whose parity - check matrices have large column weights and _ row redundancies _ , such as the algebraic ldpc codes constructed using finite fields , finite geometries and combinatorial designs .",
    "a parity - check matrix @xmath1 that satisfies the rc - constraint is called an rc - constrained parity - check matrix and the code given by its null space is called an rc - constrained ldpc code .    the overall performance of an ldpc code with iterative decoding based on belief propagation is measured by : ( 1 ) its bit and block error performance ( i.e. , how close it performs to the shannon limit or sphere packing bound ) ; 2 ) the rate of decoding convergence ( i.e. , how fast the decoding converges to a valid codeword ) ; ( 3 ) its error - floor ; and ( 4 ) how efficient it can be encoded and decoded .",
    "extensive studies and simulation results show that the performance of an ldpc code is determined by a number of structural properties of the code collectively : ( 1 ) minimum distance ( or minimum weight ) ; ( 2 ) girth and cycle distribution of its tanner graph ; ( 3 ) degree distributions of variable- and check - nodes of its tanner graph ; ( 4 ) trapping set distribution of its tanner graph ; ( 5 ) row redundancy of its parity - check matrix ; and ( 6 ) other unknown structures .",
    "no single structural property dominates the performance of a code .",
    "it is still unknown how the code performance depends on the above structural properties analytically as a function .",
    "however , some general information is known how to design ( or construct ) ldpc codes that perform well .",
    "recently , it was proved that for an rc - constrained ( @xmath3,@xmath6)-regular ldpc code , its tanner graph contains no trapping set of size @xmath9 with the number of odd degree check - nodes smaller than @xmath3 [ 12 ] .",
    "several classes of algebraic ldpc codes were proved that they do not contain harmful trapping sets of sizes smaller than their minimum distances .",
    "consequently , the error - floors of these codes are primarily dominated by their minimum distances .    for a code with a given rate to perform close to the shannon capacity ( or its threshold ) in the waterfall region , the degree distributions of the variable- and check - nodes of its tanner graph must be properly designed ( say , based on density evolution [ 13 ] ) . for a code to have low error - floor ,",
    "it must have a relatively large minimum distance and no harmful trapping sets with sizes smaller than its minimum distance . in this case , the error - floor is dominated by its minimum distance . furthermore , the error - floor performance of a code also depends on the girth of the code s tanner graph . in general ,",
    "a girth of 6 is enough if the code has large minimum distance and no small trapping sets .",
    "for the decoding of a code to converge fast , besides requiring no harmful small trapping sets and relatively large minimum distance , large row redundancy ( large number of dependent rows ) of its parity - check matrix helps .",
    "extensive simulation results show that the decoding of a code converges very fast , if its parity - check matrix has a large row redundancy .",
    "cyclic and qc - ldpc codes constructed using finite fields , finite geometries and combinatorial designs do have large row redundancies in their parity - check matrices .",
    "iterative decoding of these codes does converge very fast . for efficient encoding and decoding hardware implementation of an ldpc code ,",
    "quasi - cyclic or cyclic structure is desirable .",
    "how to design or construct an ldpc code with the above good structures is an unsolved but challenging problem .    in general , qc - ldpc codes ( regular or irregular ) given by the null spaces of arrays of circulants constructed algebraically based on finite fields , finite geometries and combinatorial designs [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 14]-[24 ]",
    "do have a good balance in terms of minimum distance , trapping set structure , row redundancy , and girth . masking the parity - check array of a qc - ldpc code based on well designed degree distributions of the code s tanner graph",
    "also provides good error performance in the waterfall region as shown in [ 20 ] .",
    "recent development in qc - ldpc codes ( qc codes in general ) is the introduction of a matrix - theoretic approach for studying these code based on matrix transformation via _ fourier transforms _ [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .",
    "this approach is amicable to the analysis and construction of qc - ldpc codes . in fourier",
    "transform domain , the parity - check matrix of a qc - ldpc code , as an array of circulants , is specified by a set of _ base matrices _ ( or a single base matrix ) over a finite field that satisfies certain constraints . based on these base matrices , an rc - constrained array of sparse circulants can be easily constructed .",
    "the null space of this rc - constrained array then gives an rc - constrained qc - ldpc code whose tanner graph has a girth of at least 6 .",
    "from these base matrices , it is quite easy to analyze the rank of the parity - check array of the code and to derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the code s tanner graph to have a given girth .",
    "the fourier transform approach put all the algebraic constructions of qc - ldpc codes developed in [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21]-[24 ] , [ 25 ] under a single framework .",
    "although many types of algebraic constructions of qc - ldpc codes have been proposed and some rank expressions have been given [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21]-[24 ] , [ 25 ] , there is still a lack of general algorithms and guideline to construct qc - ldpc codes with large redundancy , and the existing rank analysis and expressions are only applicable to some specific cases .    in this paper , we follow the fourier transform approach presented in [ 25 ] to expand the analysis and construction of new qc - ldpc codes .",
    "analysis includes the rank and row redundancy of an array of circulants whose null space gives a qc - ldpc code .",
    "a recursive algorithm for computing the rank or the row redundancy of a parity - check array in terms of its base matrices in fourier transform domain is developed .",
    "tight upper and lower bounds on the rank and row redundancy of an array of circulants are derived . in special cases , combinatorial expressions for the exact ranks",
    "are obtained .",
    "new constructions of algebraic qc - ldpc codes in the fourier transform domain with large redundancy are given , and the simulation result demonstrate that the constructed qc - ldpc codes outperform the corresponding random ldpc codes .",
    "ranks and row redundancies of the parity - check arrays of some known qc - ldpc codes are further investigated .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as following : first , we present the characterization of qc codes , binary qc - ldpc codes and nonbinary qc - ldpc codes in the fourier transform domain in section ii , section iii and section iv , respectively . then , we analyze ranks and row redundancies of qc - ldpc codes in terms of transform domain in section v. a tight upper bound on ranks and a tight lower bound on row redundancies are given in this section .",
    "later , we explain the reason why row redundancies can increase the performance of message - passing algorithms . in section",
    "vi , we further analyze the rank for two types of well - known ldpc codes constructed based on vandermonde matrices and latin squares and show that the bound derived in section v we construct a class of rc - constrained qc - ldpc codes based on random partitions of finite fields . in section vii ,",
    "we propose several types of constructions of qc - ldpc codes with large row redundancies which outperform random ldpc codes .",
    "the paper is summarized in the last section .",
    "in this paper , we consider only qc - ldpc codes constructed from finite fields of characteristic of 2 . in this and",
    "next sections , we give a review of characterization of qc codes in fourier transform domain presented in [ 25 ] .",
