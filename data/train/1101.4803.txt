    "while attending the august 2010 `` new trends in noncommutative algebra '' conference in seattle , the author of the present paper was told about the question whether the  @xmath0 functor from  af c*-algebras to dimension groups _ splits _ , that is , has a ( categorical ) right inverse .",
    "we describe here three reasons why this is not the case .",
    "the first and the third reason are more conveniently expressed _ via _ the _ nonstable @xmath0-theory _ ( often also called `` nonstable k - theory '' ) of a ring  @xmath1 , mainly described by a commutative monoid , usually denoted by  @xmath2 . if  @xmath1 is unital , then  @xmath2 is the monoid of all isomorphism types of finitely generated projective right @xmath1-modules and  @xmath14 is the grothendieck group of  @xmath2 .",
    "corollary  [ c : firstnonlift ] , implies that the more general question , whether the functor  @xmath8 has a right inverse from simplicial monoids ( cf",
    ". section  [ s : basicmon ] ) to _ exchange rings _ ( cf . warfield  @xcite , and ara  @xcite for the non - unital case ) , has a negative answer .",
    "actually , corollary  [ c : firstnonlift ] is stated for an even more general class of rings that we call _ weakly v - semiprimitive rings_. it also suggests that the original question might get more interesting if one required the morphisms between dimension groups be _ one - to - one_. _ * our second and third reason will address the modified @xmath15-splitting question*_.      proposition  [ p : nonsplit ] , involves the author s construction , introduced in wehrung  @xcite , of a dimension group with order - unit , of cardinality  @xmath16 , which is not isomorphic to  @xmath2 for any ( von  neumann ) regular ring  @xmath1 . if  @xmath0 had a right inverse from simplicial groups ( cf .",
    "section  [ s : basicmon ] ) to af c*-algebras , then it would also have a right inverse from simplicial groups to regular rings .",
    "however , due to the abovementioned counterexample , this is impossible .",
    "there are some complications , due to the requirement that the maps between simplicial groups be one - to - one , that we solve by using tools from lattice theory and universal algebra .",
    "theorem  [ t : nolift ] , is the combinatorial core of our second reason .",
    "it involves a commutative diagram  @xmath7 of simplicial monoids , indexed by a cube ( i.e. , the powerset lattice @xmath6 of a three - element set ) , that has no lifting , with respect to the functor  @xmath8 , by _ semiprimitive exchange rings_. in particular , it can be lifted neither by c*-algebras of real rank  @xmath5 nor by regular rings .",
    "in particular , the negative result of proposition  [ p : nonsplit ] extends both to regular rings ( this could have been deduced directly from  @xcite ) and to c*-algebras of real rank  @xmath5 ( this is new ) .",
    "besides those three reasons , we also provide two positive representation results of the abovementioned diagram  @xmath7 : while theorem  [ t : nolift ] implies that  @xmath7 can not be lifted , with respect to the functor  @xmath8 , by any commutative diagram of semiprimitive exchange rings , theorem  [ t : lulift ] implies that a certain `` collapsed '' image , denoted by  @xmath17 , of the diagram  @xmath7 , can be lifted with _ exchange rings _ , while theorem  [ t : luliftc * ] implies that  @xmath17 can be lifted with _",
    "c*-algebras _ ( of real rank and stable rank both equal to  @xmath9 ) . in order to be able to state that  @xmath17 is really a `` diagram '' ,",
    "we need the extended notion of diagram given in definition  [ d : diagram ] . by `` unfolding ''  @xmath17 back to  @xmath7",
    ", we obtain ( proposition  [ p : noliftlu ] ) that  @xmath7 can also be lifted with exchange rings on the one hand , and with c*-algebras on the other hand .",
    "there is no `` best of two worlds '' , because a c*-algebra is an exchange ring iff it has real rank  @xmath5 , and  @xmath7 can not be lifted by c*-algebras of real rank  @xmath5 .",
    "the reason why we need a diagram indexed by a finite lattice lies in a quite technical result of categorical algebra by gillibert and the author  @xcite called the _ condensate lifting lemma _ , cll in short .",
    "cll makes it possible to turn _ diagram counterexamples _ to _ object counterexamples _ , with possible jumps of cardinality .",
    "it works only on diagrams indexed by so - called _ almost join - semilattices _ , in particular for finite lattices .    by applying various instances of cll to the negative lifting versus positive lifting results of the cube  @xmath7 , we obtain ( cf .",
    "theorems  [ t : cxakrr0 ] and  [ t : c*cxakrr0 ] ) that _ there exists a unital exchange ring  @xmath1 , with stable rank  @xmath9 and index of nilpotence  @xmath11 , such that  @xmath2 is the positive cone of a dimension group and  @xmath2 is not isomorphic to  @xmath12 for any ring  @xmath13 which is either a c*-algebra of real rank  @xmath5 or a regular ring_. due to the cardinality - jumping properties of the `` condensate '' construction underlying cll , the exchange ring that we construct has  @xmath10 elements , while the c*-algebra that we construct is @xmath10-separable ( it has also real rank  @xmath9 ) . both the ring and the c*-algebra are stably finite , have stable rank  @xmath9 and index of nilpotence  @xmath11 , while the nonstable @xmath0-theory is the positive cone of a dimension group with order - unit of index  @xmath11 .",
    "although the present paper is written in the language of ring theory , a substantial part of our results and proofs draw their basic inspiration from related results in universal algebra and lattice theory .",
    "for example ,    * corollary  [ c : firstnonlift ] ( the `` first reason '' ) originates in tma and wehrung ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  8) , which is a non - lifting result by universal algebras with respect to the congruence lattice functor . *",
    "proposition  [ p : nonsplit ] ( the `` second reason '' ) originates in wehrung  @xcite , which solves , in the negative , representation problems with respect to various functors , including  @xmath0 , by using the lattice structure of the set of all principal right ideals in a regular ring . * the cube @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagrd ] ) , which is the key ingredient of theorem  [ t : nolift ] ( the `` third reason '' ) , originates in a cube of boolean semilattices introduced in tma and wehrung ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) .",
    "the author is indebted to pere ara , francesc perera , enrique pardo , george elliott , chris phillips , and ken goodearl for stimulating interaction and helpful comments at various stages of this paper s preparation .",
    "special thanks are due to ken goodearl for his improvement of the author s original argument , which led to theorem  [ t : firstnonlift ] , and to chris phillips for most inspiring conversations about c*-algebras and noncommutative rings at the seattle conference in august  2010 .",

    "we denote by  @xmath19 , or  @xmath9 if  @xmath1 is understood , the unit of a ring  @xmath1 .",
    "although we shall use standard commutative diagrams such as the one , denoted by  @xmath7 , introduced in figure  [ fig : diagrd ] , we shall also use sometimes diagrams of a more general kind , a formal definition of which follows .",

    ", it can be seen that these values are optimal .    * in section  [ s : al3 ] * , we take advantage of the conflict between theorem  [ t : nolift ] ( a non - lifting result of  @xmath7 ) and proposition  [ p : cdliftedexch ] ( a lifting result of  @xmath7 by exchange rings ) to construct , for every field  @xmath53 , a unital exchange @xmath53-algebra  @xmath54 such that  @xmath55 , although being the positive cone of a dimension group , is never isomorphic to  @xmath12 for either a c*-algebra of real rank  @xmath5 or a regular ring  @xmath13 . furthermore , @xmath54 has at most @xmath56 elements , and it has index of nilpotence  @xmath11 . in order to achieve this , we are using a fair amount of heavy machinery established earlier in the book gillibert and wehrung  @xcite .",
