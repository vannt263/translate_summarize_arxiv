    "semileptonic meson decays are simple , experimentally accessible and only have a single hadron in the initial and final state .",
    "they are flavour - changing weak interaction processes and hence can be used as a means of extracting the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which characterise the difference between the mass eigenstates and the weak eigenstates in the standard model .",
    "for example , the @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 decays currently provide the most accurate determination of @xmath20  @xcite , which would have been @xmath21 in the cabibbo theory of weak interactions .",
    "the mechanism of the weak interaction is well understood .",
    "hence , like elastic , electromagnetic form factors , these decays can also be used as a tool to probe the structure of the hadrons in the initial and final state .",
    "a major goal of current @xmath22-meson experiments is to determine accurately the matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the first of which is accessible via @xmath25 decays and the latter via @xmath26 .",
    "the decays with a pseudoscalar meson in both the initial and final state are the simplest to study theoretically because they are only sensitive to the vector coupling of the @xmath27-boson to the quarks and only two form factors are needed for a complete description . however , experimentally those with a vector meson in the final state provide the best statistics because the decay can proceed via both @xmath28- and @xmath29-waves .",
    "the @xmath30 decays proceed via a @xmath31 transition and experimentally this is the closest one can come to realising a `` heavy @xmath0 heavy '' transition  @xcite .",
    "it is in the analysis of these decays that heavy - quark symmetry  @xcite ; i.e. , an expansion of observables in @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the current - quark mass of the @xmath34 quark , is most likely to be of use . however , in reality the @xmath35-corrections , in particular , may nevertheless be large @xmath36% and difficult to estimate in this case .",
    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite provides a systematic method for exploring the consequences of heavy - quark symmetry .",
    "it can be used to reduce the number of independent form factors required to describe heavy @xmath0 heavy decays , relating them to a minimal number of so - called `` universal '' form factors .",
    "however , it ca nt be used to calculate the @xmath37-dependence of the form factors .",
    "this depends on the internal structure of the heavy mesons and its calculation requires the application of nonperturbative techniques .",
    "one such technique and its application to the calculation of these form factors is our focus herein .",
    "the methods of hqet are also not directly applicable to the decays @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , all of which have light mesons in the final state .",
    "a primary impediment is that the current - quark mass of the @xmath41-quark @xmath42 , hence @xmath43 is not a suitable expansion parameter .",
    "in addition , a theoretical description of these decays requires a good understanding of light quark propagation characteristics and the internal structure of light mesons .",
    "this is provided by the extensive body of dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) studies  @xcite in qcd .",
    "the dses are a system of coupled integral equations whose solutions , the @xmath44-point schwinger functions , are the fully - dressed euclidean propagators and vertices for the theory .",
    "once all the schwinger functions are known then the theory is completely specified .",
    "to arrive at a tractable problem one must truncate the system at a given level .",
    "truncations that preserve the global symmetries of a field theory are easy to implement  @xcite .",
    "preserving the gauge symmetry is more difficult but progress is being made  @xcite .    in a general covariant gauge the dressed - gluon 2-point schwinger function ( euclidean propagator ) , @xmath45 ,",
    "is characterised by a single scalar function , which we denote @xmath46 .",
    "important here is the particular , qualitatively robust result of studies of the dse for @xmath45 that @xmath46 is strongly enhanced in the infrared ; i.e , its behaviour in the vicinity of @xmath47 can be represented as a distribution  @xcite .",
    "the infrared enhancement in @xmath45 becomes prominent for @xmath48gev@xmath49 and is not peculiar to covariant gauges  @xcite .",
    "the dressed - quark propagator for a quark of flavour @xmath50 can be written in the general form , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the momentum - dependent wavefunction renormalisation and @xmath57 is the momentum - dependent quark mass - function .",
    "the dressed - gluon propagator is an important element in the kernel of the dse satisfied by @xmath58 . in existing studies of this dse that employ a dressed - quark - gluon vertex that is free of kinematic , light - cone singularities ,",
    "the infrared enhancement in @xmath45 is sufficient to ensure that @xmath59 does nt have a lehmann representation .",
    "this entails the absence of coloured quark states from the spectrum ; i.e. , quark confinement  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath60 at @xmath47 it is possible to obtain a solution , @xmath58 , of the quark dse that has a lehmann representation  @xcite .    there is another important consequence of the infrared enhancement in @xmath61 .",
    "the enhancement is characterised by a mass - scale @xmath62 and for light quarks ; i.e , @xmath63- , @xmath64- and @xmath41-quarks for which @xmath65 , it generates a significant enhancement in @xmath57 .",
    "a single , indicative and quantitative measure of this enhancement in @xmath57 is the ratio @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the euclidean constituent - quark mass defined as the solution of @xmath68 .. ] the results @xmath69 demonstrate that the infrared enhancement in @xmath46 leads to at least an order - of - magnitude infrared enhancement in @xmath57 .",

    "a significant feature of our study is the correlation of heavy @xmath0 heavy and heavy @xmath0 light transitions _ and _ their correlation with light meson observables , which are dominated by effects such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement .",
