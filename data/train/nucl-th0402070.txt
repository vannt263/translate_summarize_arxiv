    "it is commonly accepted that quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) is the true theory of strong interactions . therefore , in principle , it should describe all phases of strongly interacting matter at all densities and temperatures . in practice qcd",
    "can be exactly solved only in some limiting cases : firstly , at very high densities and temperatures when the property of asymptotic freedom allows a perturbative expansion to be used , and secondly , at zero density and high enough temperatures when it can be discretized on an euclidean lattice .",
    "although some improvements at finite chemical potential have been achieved recently @xcite , the direct application of qcd at high baryon density , or for real - time processes , is still quite problematic at present .",
    "this makes it necessary to build effective models , which respect only general properties of qcd , such as chiral symmetry , and operate with effective degrees of freedom , such as mesons and constituent quarks .",
    "the linear sigma model ( l@xmath0 m ) is one of the most popular models of this kind which has been studied already for several decades ( see e.g. refs . ) .",
    "it incorporates correctly the phenomenology of low - energy strong interactions , including chiral symmetry . at low density and temperature the matter",
    "is assumed to be in a phase where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "a phase transition that restores chiral symmetry was predicted at high temperatures or baryon densities . according to ref .",
    "@xcite qcd with two massless flavors belongs to the same universality class as the @xmath1 l@xmath0 m and therefore the phase transition is of the same order . in the case of nonzero quark masses chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken and universality arguments can not be applied .",
    "then the character of the chiral transition depends on the detailed pattern of the symmetry breaking @xcite . in recent years",
    "there have been many attempts to use different versions of the l@xmath0 m to model qcd phase transitions at finite temperature @xcite , baryon density @xcite , and for non - equilibrium conditions .    despite many studies",
    "the status of the l@xmath0 m remains somewhat controversial . in most applications of this model",
    "only mesonic degrees of freedom are included explicitly @xcite .",
    "then the model shows a chiral phase transition , but the high - temperature phase is very different from what is expected for qcd , since there are no free quarks but only heavy mesons . on the other hand ,",
    "if quark degrees of freedom are included from the beginning while fluctuations in the mesonic fields are ignored @xcite , the model also predicts a chiral transition at about the same temperature .",
    "now , however , the low - temperature phase has the wrong structure since it is dominated by constituent quarks and , in the mean field approximation , pions play no role .",
    "physically , of course , pions are expected to be the most relevant degrees of freedom at low temperatures .",
    "there have been several attempts to improve matters by including both constituent quarks and pions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the calculations have been limited to the lowest order loop expansion . a more satisfactory approach has been pursued recently , namely the ( approximate ) solution of the renormalization group flow equations @xcite which include effects due to field fluctuations .",
    "this appears to be particularly valuable in the neighborhood of critical points .    in the present paper",
    "we study a different , and possibly more transparent , approach to including field fluctuations .",
    "we deal with the full l@xmath0 m including both constituent quarks and mesonic excitations and our goal is to proceed as far as possible without invoking any kind of mean - field approximation or perturbative expansion .",
    "we shall demonstrate below that one can indeed develop a practical computational scheme where the field fluctuations are incorporated in the thermodynamic potential to all orders in a self - consistent way .",
    "this formalism corresponds to summing up the infinite series of daisy and superdaisy diagrams .",
    "of course , this is possible only within the hartree approximation where the exchange diagrams are disregarded .",
    "the resulting physical picture appears to be close to qcd - based expectations , e.g. ref .",
    "namely , the model exhibits a smooth chiral crossover transition at temperatures of 150200 mev from a low - temperature phase made of heavy constituent quarks and light pions to a high - temperature phase composed of light quarks and heavy mesonic excitations .",
    "we regard these results as quite satisfactory for modeling qcd , even though the model has no confinement . for effective theories that incorporate both chiral symmetry and confinement see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii a general l@xmath0 m is formulated and its partition function is represented within the path integral formalism .",
    "we integrate out the quark degrees of freedom and approximately reduce the problem to a purely mesonic theory with a very non - linear effective potential .",
    "this potential is then linearized around the correct ground state including equilibrium field fluctuations to all orders .",
    "finally , the mesonic contribution to the thermodynamic potential is calculated in closed form . in section iii",
    "we describe a general method for evaluating averages of complicated functions over the fluctuations of the fields .",
    "this permits easy consistency checks and allows the equations to be put into a simple form .",
    "results obtained by including or excluding zero - point contributions , in addition to the thermal fluctuations , are presented in section iv .",

    "accordingly , one proceeds by moving the operators to the left and the fields which depend on @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the right .",
    "this generates a series of commutators which involve the derivatives of the meson fields . since our interest is in low energy properties we will discard these commutator terms , tacitly assuming that the meson mode amplitudes vary slowly in position and time",

    "let us consider the equations of motion for meson fields which follow from the effective meson lagrangian ( [ mlag ] ) : @xmath37 we average these equations over the meson field fluctuations . since the @xmath0 field is expected to develop a nonvanishing expectation value @xmath38 , we decompose it as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fluctuating part . by definition",

    "in this high-@xmath100 regime the meson masses in fig .",
    "[ ftwo](b ) are approximately twice the quark mass , as would be expected for loosely bound states of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "it should be emphasized that this behavior is qualitatively different from the mean - field approximation where the constituent quark mass is defined to be @xmath155 , so that it vanishes at high temperatures .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities , energy density , pressure and entropy density , as functions of temperature are presented in fig .",
    "[ fthree ] . at high temperatures",
    "these are dominated by quarks . for a massless quark gas of degeneracy 12 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , and in the nozpt case in fig .",
    "[ fthree](a ) these values are achieved at high temperatures .",
    "there is only a small contribution from mesons , since they are heavy , indicating that the system has effectively become a massless quark gas .",
    "the same can not be said for the zpt case in fig .",

    "this is due the quark mass remaining comparable to the temperature . the quark condensate is displayed in fig .",
    "[ ffour ] for the zpt case since the nozpt case has only a small thermal contribution .",
    "the condensate is dominated by the zero - point contribution .",
    "even though one might expect the thermal part to increase with @xmath100 , the condensate ( [ cond ] ) is approximately @xmath158 , so the decrease in @xmath38 is sufficient to bring the thermal contribution to zero at high temperature",
    ". thus @xmath159 starts at @xmath120 with the chosen empirical value and rapidly becomes negligible when @xmath38 becomes small .",
    "this is the physically expected behavior .",
    "the expressions above which involve @xmath80 all require the calculation of two integrals over the gaussian weighting functions as well as a momentum integration .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to examine simpler procedures .",
    "the most natural simplification is to thermally average the quark mass and then insert it in eqs .",
    "( [ omd1 ] ) , ( [ omd2 ] ) and ( [ omd3 ] ) .",

    "( [ m2 ] ) is even simpler . here",
    "the thermodynamic potential density is approximated @xmath165 , and in the equation of motion @xmath166 the second derivatives are @xmath167 for both sigma and pion . in this case the quark contributions to the meson masses in ( [ msigf ] ) and ( [ mpif ] ) vanish .",
    "note that ambiguity in the evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ omd1 ] ) , ( [ omd2 ] ) and ( [ omd3 ] ) when using a thermally averaged quark mass is resolved by using eq .",
    "( [ minv ] ) to require that @xmath168 be identically zero .",
    "then the thermodynamic potential density is a minimum with respect to variations in the scalar condensate @xmath38 , as it should be .    in figs .",
    "[ ffive ] and [ fsix ] we compare the full zpt results with those obtained by using the @xmath153 and @xmath154 approximations for various quantities of interest .",
    "the parameters in the left column of table [ zzz ] are used throughout . at temperatures above 220 mev",
    "both approximations are able to reproduce the exact results reasonably well with , perhaps , a slight preference for the @xmath153 case .",
    "below that temperature there are larger deviations between the exact and the approximate results .",
    "the crossover occurs at a 15 mev higher temperature in the @xmath153 approximation . at lower temperatures the @xmath153 approximation gives a reasonable , although not extremely accurate account of the exact results .",
    "the @xmath154 approximation , on the other hand , shows marked deviations for the sigma mean field and mass , @xmath38 and @xmath135 , and the quark condensate .",
    "of course , this can be much improved by refitting the parameters at @xmath120 .",
    "however , then one finds that there are no physical solutions at temperatures just above 300 mev .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath153 approximation is to be preferred and that it describes the trends of the exact results quite well , being most accurate at high temperature .",
    "our main goal in this paper was to understand the role played by field fluctuations in effective chiral models . we have shown how to average field functions of arbitrary complexity over the field fluctuations .",
    "this allowed a set of self - consistent equations for the average field and the masses to be formulated which led to consistent thermodynamics .",
    "we have applied this approach to the linear sigma model , including both mesonic and quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the quark degrees of freedom were integrated out and the effective action was linearized according to eq .",
    "( [ linac ] ) .",
    "thus we described the @xmath0 and @xmath169 mesons as quasiparticles and their properties were properly taken into account in the thermodynamic potential .",
    "we have considered two versions of the model : zpt where both zero - point and thermal fluctuations are included , and nozpt where only thermal fluctuations are present .",
    "the former was able to describe the quark condensate and the vacuum value was chosen according to qcd - based estimates . to accommodate this value",
    "a sigma mass of 700 mev was employed which , while within the broad range set by the particle data group @xcite , is 100 mev larger than the traditional value .",
    "we also needed to employ separate renormalization scales for the mesonic and quark zero - point contributions of 450 mev and 950 mev , respectively .",
    "for both versions of the model we required the constituent quark mass in vacuum to be 1/3 of the free nucleon mass .",
    "numerical results were presented only for the case of zero net quark density , i.e. @xmath170 . the calculations revealed an interesting and consistent picture . with increasing temperature",
    "we saw a gradual decrease of the condensate and an increase of the sigma and pion fluctuations .",
    "the model gave a crossover type of chiral transition at a temperature of about 198 mev ( 150 mev ) in the zpt ( nozpt ) case .",
    "in the transition region the rms field fluctuations became comparable in magnitude to the condensate .",
    "on the other hand we did not observe the strong increase in the sigma field fluctuations which would appear in the vicinity of a true critical point .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry was seen in the behavior of the sigma and pion masses , which became degenerate above the transition region , and in the behavior of the quark condensate which decreased to zero .",
    "the effective quark mass first showed a modest decrease with temperature , but above the transition region it started to increase and this trend was quite strong for the zpt case .",
    "since the condensate was already nearly zero , this growth was induced entirely by the meson field fluctuations . in condensed matter physics",
    "this phenomenon is known as pseudogap formation . at high temperatures the meson masses increased much more rapidly than the quark mass , so that they effectively decoupled from the system and we had a nearly ideal gas of quarks .",
    "in the zpt case the quark effective mass was comparable to the temperature , however in the nozpt case the mass was much smaller so that the thermodynamics closely resembled a massless quark gas .",
    "on the other hand , at low temperatures quarks were heavy in comparison to the temperature while pions were relatively light so that we had an ideal gas of pions with mass close to the physical mass .",
    "certainly , a qualitatively similar behavior is expected on the basis of qcd .",
    "the transition between these two regimes occurs at a temperature which is surprisingly close to that found in lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition we considered simplified approaches in which the quark mass was treated as a number rather than a function of the meson fields ; these were found to be quite successful in the high - temperature , chiral - restored regime , but less accurate at low temperatures .",
    "we also briefly discussed the dependence of the chiral transition on the vacuum pion mass .",
    "as the chiral limit was approached by reducing the pion mass to a fraction @xmath171 of its true vacuum value the crossover transition became a first order phase transition .",
    "the critical temperature was found to be quite insensitive to the value of the pion mass , as in lattice analyses @xcite .    in the future",
    "it would be interesting to perform calculations for non - zero quark chemical potential . this would give the possibility of exploring the phase diagram of the model in the @xmath100@xmath16 plane and comparing it with the predictions of other qcd - motivated models .",
    "it would also be interesting to optimize the model in order to achieve better correspondence with qcd .",
    "some obvious omissions from the present approach include vector mesons , strange quarks , the gluon condensate and gluon - like excitations @xcite .",
    "the latter would provide the correct degrees of freedom at high temperature .",
    "also in the future , more realistic patterns of symmetry breaking , including for instance the @xmath172 anomaly , should be considered .",

    "@xcite was to assume for the purposes of counting that @xmath173 although in the numerical evaluation of the final expressions the actual values of the thermal averages were used .",
    "equation ( [ alleq ] ) is strictly true only in the high temperature limit , where the sigma and pion masses become degenerate , however at low temperatures one can also show that the correct expressions are obtained .",
    "now , writing @xmath174 , the troublesome cross term , @xmath175 , was expanded out . using ( [ alleq ] ) the expressions needed could be cast in terms of a function @xmath176 .",
    "equation ( [ alleq ] ) allows the general expression ( [ genf ] ) to be written as a four - dimensional integral for the thermal average of the function in question : @xmath177 since only the magnitude @xmath178 occurs in the integrand , the angular integration may be carried out giving @xmath179    equation ( [ genf4 ] ) then allows an easy evaluation of the principal expressions used in refs .",

    "first we prove by induction that in this case @xmath187 where @xmath30 and @xmath35 are integers .",
