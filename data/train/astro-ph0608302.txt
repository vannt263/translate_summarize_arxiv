    "for the last decade , measurements of the primordial d / h ratio in qso sightlines have provided increasingly more precise constraints on the cosmological baryon density . although the measurement of d / h is simple in principle , compared to the other light elements produced during big bang nucleosynthesis ,",
    "finding those qso absorption lines systems which are suitable for measuring d / h has proven observationally challenging @xcite .    for a qso absorption system to show d / h ,",
    "a number of criteria must be met ( see @xcite , hereafter k03 , for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "first , the hydrogen column density must be large enough ( since d / h is of the order of one part in @xmath4 ) such that deuterium can be observed using modern high - resolution spectrographs .",
    "second , the velocity structure of the hydrogen absorption must be simple enough , ideally a single component of gas , so that the deuterium absorption is well resolved given the small 82  offset from the hydrogen lyman lines .",
    "third , there can be little to no interloping  forest or metal lines at the position of the deuterium absorption , since such absorption strongly complicates attempts to constrain the deuterium column density .",
    "unfortunately ,  forest absorption is both ubiquitous and stochastic in high redshift qso spectra .",
    "finally , the background qso must be bright enough to obtain high signal - to - noise , high - resolution spectroscopy at @xmath5with a reasonable allotment of telescope time .",
    "each one of these criteria act to decrease the probability that a d / h measurement can be made towards any given qso , and since _ all _ the criteria must be met , the resultant probability of a qso sightline being suitable for measuring d / h is very low , with only approximately 1% of qsos at @xmath6 able to provide a measurement of d / h .    to date",
    ", there are few measurements of d / h in qso spectra ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , k03 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements constrain the baryon density  through the framework of standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , which predicts the abundances of the light elements as a function of the baryon  to  photon ratio @xmath7 and the expansion rate of the universe @xcite , and through the cosmic microwave background radiation , which provides the photon density .",
    "a measurement of the ratio of any of the light nuclei produced in sbbn gives the baryon density , and measurement of additional abundance ratios test the theory ( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein for a current census of d / h and the other light element abundances ) .",
    "recent measurements of the temperature angular power spectrum of the cmb ( spergel  2006 ) also provide a measurement of depending on the assumptions made , with a level of accuracy roughly equal to or greater than that provided by d / h .",
    "nevertheless , measurements of d / h are still important for a number of reasons .",
    "first , primordial d / h probes the universe at one of the earliest times in the universe accessible with current observational and theoretical techniques .",
    "second , the light element abundances predicted from sbbn do not all agree with each other ; most notably the observationally inferred abundance of  is significantly lower than that expected from sbbn and d / h @xcite .",
    "third , d / h can help constrain deviations from sbbn , such as inhomogeneous bbn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , relic primordial particle decays ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , or non - standard neutrino physics ( * ? ? ?",
    "fourth , the dispersion in the measurements of d / h is larger than would be expected from the individual measurement errors ( k03 ) , i.e. , the data demand both a better understanding of the errors on the current measurements and new constraints .",
    "fifth , the value of  derived from d / h and sbbn requires many fewer priors than the cmb derived value .",
    "moreover , the  from d / h can be used in principle as a prior in the cmb analysis , and the ratio of the values for  from d / h and the cmb offer a precision test of the hot big bang model . finally , the existing measurements of d / h show evidence of a trend of decreasing d / h with increasing .",
    "k03 suggested that this trend ( and the dispersion in d / h values ) is due to error under - estimation .",
    "fortunately , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by virtue of its large sample of high redshift qso spectra ( the data release 4 alone contains 5036 qsos with @xmath8 ) gives us a new data set to find those special sightlines which can show d / h .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we present a new measurement of d / h in a qso sightline from the sdss , , which was chosen as part of our high - resolution survey for lyman limit absorption @xcite .",
    "we have obtained two high - resolution spectra of the @xmath9 quasar  using two different spectrographs , the mike @xcite echelle spectrograph on the 6.5 meter magellan clay telescope at las campanas , and the upgraded hires @xcite spectrometer on the 10 meter keck - i telescope on mauna kea .",
    "the mike spectrum was obtained as part of our ongoing high - resolution survey for lyman limit absorption and was selected from the sdss because of the redshift and brightness of the qso .",
    "the mike spectrum was obtained on may 10 , 2004 and covers the spectral range 32217420  , with an exposure time of 3600 seconds .",
    "the data were obtained in sub - arcsecond seeing with a one arcsecond slit , which provides a resolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the blue and red arms of the spectrograph respectively .",
    "the mike data was reduced using the mike reduction pipelineburles / www / mike/ ] , and has a signal to noise ratio of approximately 12 at @xmath12 .",
    "the hires spectrum was taken on 2006 april 11 and covers the spectral range 33386200  , with an exposure time of 4100 seconds .",
    "the data were taken in sub - arcsecond seeing with a 1.148 arcsecond slit , which provides a resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "the data were reduced using the hires reduction pipelinexavier / hiredux / index.html ] , and have a signal to noise ratio of approximately 20 at @xmath12  .",
    "the hires data are the primary source for the measurement of d / h presented below owing to the higher signal - to - noise and spectral resolution . with the exception of the h  i  line",
    ", we used the hires spectrum to determine all values for column densities presented in the text . because we were more successful at fluxing data from the mike spectrometer",
    ", we use the flux calibrated mike spectrum to constrain the  value in the  line whose profile spans several echelle orders .",
    "inspection of the mike spectrum of  shows that there is a dla at @xmath0 which is also responsible for the break in flux from the lyman limit of the absorber at @xmath14  .",
    "the parameters which describe the observed , single component of absorption ( @xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17 ) for the lyman series and metal - lines in the dla are presented in table  [ dhlinetab ] .",
    "the parameters and their errors are derived predominately from voigt profile fits to the data using the vpfit routine kindly provided by r. carswell and j. webb .",
    "for some of the metal - line transitions , we opt instead to use the apparent optical depth technique @xcite to measure the column densities , and then use that column density as a fixed input parameter to vpfit to determine the @xmath17 and @xmath16 values for the absorption in question . the absence of metal - line absorption at the position of d aruges that the observed feature in the lyman series is not interploping h.    the hydrogen column density of the dla is sufficiently large to show damping wings in the lyman @xmath18@xmath19 transitions ( figure  [ fig_lyseries ] ) .",
    "these features allow for a precise measurement of the h  i column density . in the case of",
    "the dla  lies near the qso emission line and the assignment of the continuum level over the full extent of the absorption feature is non - trivial .",
    "fortunately , this issue is minimized in two ways .",
    "first , the mike spectrum is flux calibrated , which allows for an easier assignment of the continuum level to the  line , although it is still subject to unidentified emission features inherent to the qso .",
    "second , the h  i derived from the damping features in the higher order lines is less susceptible to large continuum shape errors , because the profile spans a significantly smaller wavelength range than the  line . in particular , the  line of the dla places an excellent constraint on the column density , because the line has prominent damping features , covers only @xmath20  , and has little interloping hydrogen absorption .",
    "to arrive at the best estimate of  we simultaneously vary the values of  along with the shape and amplitude of the local continuum level .",
    "this variation continues until we arrive at a value of the  which best reproduces the data whilst having a reasonable continuum shape .",
    "we adopt a redshift and velocity width of the h  i , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , from a fit to the the higher order lyman series transitions .",
    "of some concern is the fact that the redshift of the h  i agrees only at the @xmath23  level with the redshift inferred from low - ion metal - lines ( table  [ dhlinetab ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that there exists some degeneracy between @xmath16 the @xmath17 for the lyman series transitions we use , along with the increasing effects of poor signal - to - noise for shorter wavelength data ( i.e. higher up the lyman series ) .",
    "furthermore , we can not discount the possibility that the h  i gas is multi - component , however there is little evidence from the metal - line transitions that this is the case .",
    "furthermore the lyman series lines all appear to be well fit using a single component , with a few departures due to interloping gas at different redshifts from the system which shows deuterium .",
    "when we consider the lyman @xmath18@xmath19 transitions , we arrive at a best estimate of the h  i of  .",
    "the errors on  are dominated by continuum uncertainties and by signal - to - noise , two effects which correlate , particularly on smaller wavelength scales .    as can be seen in figure [ fig_lyseries ] ,",
    "we observe resolved absorption by deuterium in the lyman series from  all the way through to lyman-13 . because the d  i column density is large , the absorption is saturated until we reach deuterium lyman-11 , which offers the best constraint on the  value . for this transition ,",
    "we measure  , where the errors come from the error estimate of vpfit alone ( i.e. independent of continuum error ) .",
    "the transition suffers from mild contamination by interloping hydrogen on @xmath24  to the red side of the absorption profile , but this absorption has little effect on the  value .",
    "fits to the data including and excluding a model for the interloping hydrogen improve the @xmath25 for the fit without changing the value or uncertainty in the  value .",
    "we have also estimated  using the aodm technique , and arrive at a consistent value  @xmath26 .",
    "the optical depth of this absorption feature is ideal for measuring a column density because it is highly insensitive to the local continuum level placement . if we vary the amplitude of the continuum level by as much as 20% about the adopted value the central value , of  changes by less than the statistical error .",
    "the  value is further constrained by other lyman series lines , e.g.   the depth of the deuterium lyman8 transition rules out significantly larger or smaller values of .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath27 for the deuterium absorption , consistent with that of the h  i and other metals .",
    "we measure a velocity width of @xmath28  for the deuterium absorption .",
    "neutral hydrogen gas with  @xmath29  is not expected to have such a narrow doppler parameter @xcite whereas the value is reasonable for d.    we detect over 30 metal - line transitions in the dla absorber .",
    "a subset of these are summarized in table  [ dhlinetab ] and are shown in figure  [ fig_velp ] .",
    "in particular , we note the presence of absorption at @xmath30 , which is well described by a single component .",
    "absorption is important for measuring d / h in that directly traces the gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and because / @xmath31 o / h in most environments ( especially dla ) . adopting the measured value of @xmath32",
    ", we establish a metallicity of [ o / h]@xmath1 for the absorber assuming the solar ( atmospheric ) oxygen abundance reported by @xcite .",
    "this metallicity is higher than all the other extragalactic measurements of d / h .",
    "nevertheless , a 3% solar metallicity implies minimal astration of d and we believe this system is still representative of primordial gas ( see figure 20 of k03 and @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the velocity structure of the absorber , as traced by the metal lines , is amongst the simplest yet observed for a dla @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the value of d / h we obtain for the absorber and place it within the context of the combined d / h ratio for all qso absorption systems .",
    "the best estimates of the and column densities in the dla towards imply a value of .",
    "the errors on d / h stem primarily from the effect of continuum placement uncertainty on the h  i column density , and the signal - to - noise ratio of the data at lyman-11 where the column density is best constrained .",
    "turning now to the combined d / h value from qso sightlines , figure [ fig_alldh ] shows the new value of d / h from  along with the previous values of d / h taken from the sample discussed in k03 . we do not include the result of crighton  ( 2004 ) , since we feel that the errors on d / h in this system have been under - estimated , particularly for the reported  value .",
    "we do not include the results of @xcite for the reasons given in k03 .",
    "the horizontal solid line shows the value for the weighted mean of the data , which we round to @xmath33 to keep consistent with the literature , and the dashed lines show the @xmath34 uncertainties estimated from a jackknife analysis of the weighted means . in the case of asymmetric errors on individual d / h measurements ,",
    "we have adopted the larger of the errors for the calculation of the weighting .",
    "prior to the addition of  to the sample of d / h measurements of k03 , a @xmath25minimizing linear fit to the data of the form @xmath35  provided an acceptable fit to the data ( @xmath36 ) . with the inclusion of , however , we see a significant decrease in the likelihood that there is a d / h trend with . although the data are best fit with a non  zero slope , @xmath37 ,",
    "the slope differs from zero at only the @xmath38 level ( even before accounting for the presence of  in both axes ) .",
    "furthermore , this is not a good model of the data , with @xmath39 . as such ,",
    "the data give little confidence to the existence of a trend of d / h with .",
    "finally , if we were to include the @xcite and @xcite results , the likelihood that d / h depends on  is further diminished .",
    "the presumption of a single value for d / h , however , is still not supported by the observations ; the observed scatter exceeds that expected assuming the error estimates reported in the literature .",
    "our adopted error on the best estimate for d / h from the jackknife estimation exceeds the error on the weighted mean by a factor of two .",
    "likewise , the @xmath25 of the six measurements of d / h about the weighted mean value of  is high , with @xmath40 . although there is the possibility that the scatter in the individual d / h measurements is real , we prefer the hypothesis of k03 that the errors in some of the individual measurements , if not all of them , are underestimated .",
    "it is likely that a combination of new methods of error analysis and new qso sightlines is required to fully address the excess scatter in the d / h measurements .    using the framework from sbbn @xcite ,",
    "the value for d / h of  translates to a value for the cosmological baryon density of , where the first error term comes from the errors on d / h explained above , and the second term from the uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates . by comparison",
    ", the wmap three year result provides an estimate of @xmath41 , which lies within the @xmath3 error estimate on  from d / h ( spergel  2006 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the absorber showing d / h in the spectrum of  was discovered serendipitously as part of our survey for lyman limit absorption , and is the first d / h measurement from a qso first discovered by the sdss .",
    "the sdss data release 3 alone has 405 dla with redshifts optimal for d / h ( @xmath42 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , assuming a small fraction of these dla provide measurements of d / h , the sdss will give many tens of measurements .",
    "the situation improves further if one considers the lyman limit systems toward the sdss qso sample .",
    "this contrasts with the slls and dla which give the  from the  and  lines , and the  from the unsaturated d  i lines in the lyman series .",
    "because of this effect , the dla and slls offer more pathlength per qso to potentially find d / h . all of these effects combine to give a likely distribution of d / h measurements which is roughly independent of , a hypothesis which is already being hinted at in the current sample , since two measurements come from lls , two from slls , and two from dla .",
    "altogether , the sdss offers the best opportunity for investigating the larger than expected scatter in d / h and correlations with , metallicity , etc .",
