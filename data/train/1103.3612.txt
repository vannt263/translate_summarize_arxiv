    "the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) was originally proposed for describing the spontaneous emission in a semi - classical manner by jaynes and cummings during the 1960s @xcite .",
    "the jcm consists of a single two - level atom and a single cavity mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the jcm interaction between the atom and the cavity mode is obtained by the rotating wave approximation , so that each photon creation causes an atomic de - excitation and each photon annihilation causes an atomic excitation .",
    "the jcm is a soluble quantum mechanical model .",
    "moreover , it is simple enough for expressing the basic and most important characteristics of the matter - radiation interaction .",
    "because of these distinct advantages , both theoretical and experimental researchers in the field of quantum optics have been studying the jcm eagerly for decades .",
    "if we initially prepare the atom in the ground state and the cavity mode in the coherent state , the jcm shows the periodic spontaneous collapse and the revival of the rabi oscillations during its time - evolution @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was experimentally demonstrated in the 1980s @xcite .",
    "we can regard this phenomenon as a direct evidence for discreteness of energy states of photons .",
    "thus , the jcm has a fully quantum property , which can not be explained by semi - classical physics .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the non - dissipative jcm at finite low temperature .",
    "we assume that the atom and the cavity mode are initially in the thermal equilibrium state and the thermal coherent state , respectively , at a certain finite low temperature @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "thus , we can describe an initial probability distribution of quantum states of the system with the canonical ensemble .",
    "moreover , we assume the time - evolution of the system is governed by a unitary operator generated with the jcm hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that the system does not suffer from dissipation and its time - evolution is reversible .",
    "the thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) formalism was developed by takahashi and umezawa for dealing with phenomena in isolated systems during the 1970s @xcite .",
    "the tfd formalism has a wide range of applications in equilibrium situations of closed systems , as well . in this paper",
    ", we think about applications of the tfd to non - dissipative closed systems .",
    "the tfd formalism helps us to be more successful than conventional formalisms do as follows : calculating an expectation value of a pure state created by the tfd mechanics , we can obtain a thermal average in statical mechanics . in return for this benefit ,",
    "the tfd formalism requires us to let the original hilbert space double in size for the tensor product .",
    "then , the tfd formalism induces thermal - like noises in two mode squeezed states generated by the thermal bogoliubov transformation .    describing the jcm at finite low temperature with the tfd formalism ,",
    "we can write down a thermal average ( an expectation value ) of an observable as a series expansion containing powers of @xmath1 in a systematic manner . [ the explicit form of the function @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is a frequency of the cavity mode .",
    "we note that @xmath4 as @xmath5 . ]",
    "we call this series the low - temperature expansion .",
    "this prescription is a new key point of this paper as compared with the other past works .    strictly speaking ,",
    "because we introduce a finite temperature into both the atom and the cavity field , the perturbation theory has to include two parameters of the temperature . in this paper , we let @xmath6 and @xmath1 denote the parameters of the temperature for the atom and the cavity field , respectively . [ the explicit form of the function @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is a transition frequency of the two - level atom .",
    "we note that @xmath9 as @xmath5 .",
    "] however , the hilbert space of the atom is two - dimensional , so that we can solve the problem concerning the atom exactly .",
    "on the other hand , the dimension of the hilbert space of the cavity field is infinite , so that we can not give a rigorous treatment for the problem concerning the cavity field , which interacts with the atom .",
    "this is the reason why the low - temperature expansion contains powers of @xmath1 , but not @xmath6 .    as mentioned before , in this paper , we initially prepare the cavity mode in the thermal coherent state , which is proposed by barnett , knight , mann and revzen as a natural extension of the zero - temperature ordinary coherent state according to the tfd @xcite",
    ". then , we investigate the time - evolution of the atomic population inversion using the low - temperature expansion up to the third order terms in @xmath1 .",
    "we regard this low - temperature expansion as the third order perturbation theory .",
    "to take another approach , we give an intuitive discussion and obtain the following expectation : the period of the revival of the rabi oscillations becomes longer as the temperature rises , where the temperature is finite but low enough and varies in the neighborhood of the absolute zero .",
    "numerical results obtained by the third order perturbation theory reproduce well this temperature dependence of the period .    here",
    ", we write about related works . the thermal jcm without dissipation",
    "is investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these references , the cavity field is prepared initially in a thermal equilibrium state , whose statistical behavior is given by the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "then , the system consisting of the atom and the cavity mode is assumed to evolve with a unitary operator generated by the jcm hamiltonian , so that its time - evolution is reversible .",

    "some researchers attempt to extend the jcm hamiltonian according to the tfd formalism @xcite .",
