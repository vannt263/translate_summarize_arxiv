    "the hiv epidemic has had significant impact worldwide , but it has had an especially large impact in subsaharan africa  @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this difference are many , complex , and not fully understood .",
    "one proposed factor is a larger frequency of sexual partnerships that overlap in time , the so - called `` concurrency hypothesis ''  @xcite .",
    "the concurrency hypothesis has received significant attention , but it is controversial  @xcite .",
    "the development and evaluation of potential interventions against infectious disease spread requires us to be able to predict the spread of the disease with and without the intervention in place . a crucial factor that must be considered in evaluating",
    "any potential intervention is the indirect effects of the intervention : if we directly preventing one infection from occurring , then this also prevents that individual from transmitting onwards , thus indirectly reducing exposures of other individuals . in turn",
    "their reduction in exposure reduces potential exposures of others further down the line .",
    "such a feedback mechanism is an inherently nonlinear effect , and so the full outcome of an intervention will depend nonlinearly on the direct effect .",
    "doubling the intervention effort will not double the intervention impact .",
    "it may have greater or lesser impact depending on the magnitude of the indirect effect .",
    "because of this , we often rely on mathematical models to predict the total intervention outcome .",
    "the required model complexity depends on the intervention under consideration , the biological properties of the disease , and the contact structure of the population .",
    "most mathematical models of disease spread ignore the fact that partnerships have duration .",
    "this is reasonable in a population with many partnerships and low transmission probabilities  @xcite , but for a disease such as hiv , the relevant partnerships are often long - lasting and the typical number of overlapping partnerships is generally small . to be relevant for the concurrency hypothesis",
    ", we require that the mathematical model incorporate partnership duration in some form . without it , it is impossible to consider partnerships that overlap in time .",
    "additionally , given the time - scale of the hiv epidemic , demographic turnover plays an important role .",
    "there has not been a mathematical model which captures all of these features , and so most investigations turn to simulation , many of which are reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "the absence of an analytic model contributes to a large gap in our ability to understand concurrency .",
    "analytic models make it much easier to interpret model predictions , to specifically isolate the impact of different effects , and to clarify underlying assumptions .",
    "simulated results may be difficult to replicate by other researchers , the slow process of simulation may make parameter space impossible to investigate , and it may be difficult to identify which assumptions of the simulation are responsible for which outcomes .",
    "all of this contributes to the ongoing controversy about concurrency , and even miscommunication within the field . with an analytic model ,",
    "these issues are significantly reduced .",
    "recent work  @xcite has shown that it is possible to make mathematical models for si and sir disease spread in networks with only a handful of equations .",
    "the approach has been generalized to networks with changing partnerships , but still assume a closed population . because the hiv epidemic developed over decades , it is not appropriate to ignore individuals entering and leaving the at risk - population as they age .    in this paper",
    "we adapt the approach of  @xcite in order to accommodate `` births '' and `` deaths '' representing entry into and exit from the at - risk population .",
    "we show that the resulting equations accurately predict the outcome of simulations in large populations , and our primary focus is on using the model to investigate the role that concurrency can play in the spread of a `` susceptible  infected '' ( si ) disease such as hiv .      a potentially important , but",
    "incompletely understood , factor in the spread of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases is the role of `` concurrent '' relationships as compared to serial monogamy  @xcite . whether its impact is significant",
    "is hotly debated  @xcite .",
    "to highlight the potential role of concurrency , we consider an individual `` alex '' who has two partners `` bobbie '' and `` charlie '' over a period of 1 year .",
    "we demonstrate two potential partnership arrangements and explore their impact on disease transmission in fig .",
    "[ fig : concurrency_display ] .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the partnership with bobbie lasts for six months and is replaced by a six month partnership with charlie ( the serial case ) , while in the second scenario both partnerships overlap for the entire period ( the concurrent case ) . in the concurrent case ,",
    "the intervals between transmitting events are doubled .",

    "to simply the model we present , we have neglected many effects .",
    "many of these can be easily incorporated into more sophisticated versions of the model .    *",
    "* acute phase : * before mounting an immune response , an individual s viral load is several orders of magnitude larger than after the immune response develops . during this early phase infectiousness",
    "is dramatically increased  @xcite .",
    "if the individual has multiple partnerships , then many more infections can happen in this phase than would be seen if the individual were only in contact with its infector .",
    "* * heterogeneous degree : * some people have many more partnerships than others  @xcite .",
    "they generally become infected sooner , and in turn transmit to more individuals . even if many individuals do not engage in concurrent relationships ,",
    "if there are some who have many partners , the effects may still be present .",
    "this provides an opportunity to reduce disease transmission through an intervention that encourages those without concurrent relationships to select partners without concurrent relationships .",
    "* * temporal behavior changes : * if the disease dynamics are driven by individuals having periodic high - risk episodes between long - term relationships , then the assumptions of this model are invalid . to correct this , the model must be adapted to allow for periods of high risk behavior , for example when a partnership ends .",
    "* * age structure : * if there is age - structure in the contact patterns , different effects may be seen .",
    "for example , we might think of the younger cohort as a population which has not yet been invaded by infection . in this case",
    ", the results about disease invading may be more relevant than the results about population size . here reducing concurrency could be expected to play an important role in slowing the invasion of this younger cohort . *",
    "* coital dilution : * we have assumed that the transmission rate scales such that individuals have effectively the same number of sexual acts regardless of their number of partners .",
    "this allows us to isolate the effect of concurrency from the effect of frequency of sexual acts .",
    "however , if concurrent relationships are associated with more frequent sexual acts , then the conclusions we reach here may not be valid . to correct for this",
    ", we need to appropriately weight the transmission rates based on the number of concurrent relationships each partner has .",
    "we have derived an analytic model which accurately reproduces simulated si epidemics in a population with concurrent relationships and demographic turnover .",
    "we use this model to isolate the role of concurrency in the spread of a disease such as hiv . in isolating concurrency",
    ", we consciously choose to neglect a number of other important effects .",
    "although the model is highly simplistic , it gives insight into the role of concurrency .",
    "we see first that the impact of concurrency on the equilibrium size of si epidemics appears to saturate quite quickly .",
    "consequently we might expect that interventions targeting concurrency will have little impact unless they come close to eliminating concurrent relationships .    however , we see a much larger role for concurrency in determining the early growth rate . as concurrency increases ,",
    "the early growth is increased , and the impact of concurrency saturates much slower than for the epidemic size .",
    "so for slowing the initial invasion of an epidemic , reducing concurrency is likely to have an important impact .",
    "our observations that the impact of concurrency saturates suggests care may be needed before diverting resources from some intervention to an intervention aimed at reducing concurrency .",
    "a more realistic model is needed , and some consideration will need to be made for whether the population is already in equilibrium or whether the epidemic is still growing .    the model presented here is intended as a framework for developing more detailed models .",
    "our goal in introducing this model has been to provide this framework and clearly demonstrate that it is possible to use analytic models to explore disease spread in populations with concurrent relationships with demographic turnover .",
    "the predictions our model has provided are true for the simplistic assumptions made .",
    "more careful models will be needed to identify conditions under which interventions targeting concurrency will be effective . these models will need to incorporate additional effects such as the acute phase of infection and more realistic information about degree distributions and correlations .",
    "our primary goal in the supporting information is to derive the governing equations . for simplicity",
    ", we have ignored many effects .",
    "although in the main text we assume all individuals have the same number of concurrent partners , in our derivation here we allow different individuals within the same population to have a different number of concurrent partners as long as all partnerships have the same transmission probability and typical duration .",
    "these assumptions could be modified , and a number of other complexities added to the model we develop here , but we do not attempt this now .      we now describe the stochastic rules we assume govern the population and disease dynamics .",
    "we use a discrete - time model .",
    "we begin with the population dynamics in the absence of disease . at each time step ,",
    "@xmath50 individuals enter the population , and each individual has probability @xmath2 to independently leave the population .",
    "this leads to an equilibrium population size of @xmath4 , but with variation around this value .",
    "each individual @xmath51 has a constant number of partners @xmath52 which is assigned independently to @xmath51 when @xmath51 enters the population .",
    "@xmath53 gives the probability that @xmath54 .",
    "we think of @xmath51 as having @xmath52 `` stubs '' ( also called `` binding sites '' by  @xcite ) .",
    "the stubs pair with stubs from other individuals to form partnerships .",
    "when a partnership ends the two newly freed stubs join with other free stubs to form new partnerships .",
    "we assume that individuals immediately replace their partners so that at the start of each time step all individuals have a full set of partners .",
    "we begin with a fraction @xmath7 of the population randomly infected . in each time step",
    ", multiple events can happen .",
    "since the order of events can matter ( a partnership can not transmit after it ends ) , we provide a consistent order , shown in figure  [ fig : order_of_events ] .",
    "first , infected individuals transmit to their susceptible partners independently with probability @xmath1 .",
    "second , individuals may `` die '' ( or leave the population ) independently with probability @xmath2 .",
    "third , @xmath3 new individuals are added to the population ( so the average number present is @xmath4 ) and assigned stubs .",
    "fourth , each remaining partnership breaks with probability @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the unpaired stubs form new partnerships , subject to the constraint that old partnerships are not reformed and individuals do not join to themselves . in simulations , these constraints are occasionally not satisfied , in which case the corresponding individuals wait a time step before attempting to reform edges . in a large population , the impact of this failure is negligible , and for our analytic equations below , we can assume that they are satisfied .",
    "it will be useful to define the function @xmath55 to be the probability generating function of the degree distribution .",
    "it has some important properties : @xmath56 ,  @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the mean of the random variable @xmath59 .",
    "we now provide a derivation of the deterministic equations governing the large population limit of our model .",
    "the derivation is based on  @xcite .",
    "we review the concept of a `` test individual '' ( effectively equivalent to the _ cavity state _ of  @xcite ) .",
    "we start with the assumption that the population - scale dynamics are deterministic in the large population limit .",
    "a direct consequence of this assumption is the observation that the probability a randomly selected individual has a given status equals the proportion of the population with that status .",
    "calculating the probability a random individual has a given status turns out to be simpler than calculating the number of individuals in each state .",
    "an important observation is that the probability a single randomly chosen individual @xmath51 has a given status is not affected if we prevent it from infecting any other individuals if we prevent @xmath51 from transmitting to its neighbors , then the status of its neighbors become independent of one another , but this does not alter the probability that @xmath51 is susceptible .",
    "we define a _ test individual _ to be an individual @xmath51 chosen uniformly at random from the population and prevented from transmitting infection .",
    "we have the following sequence of questions which have identical answers if the dynamics are deterministic : given the initial conditions ,    1 .",
    "what fraction of individuals are susceptible or infected at time @xmath0 ? 2 .",
    "what is the probability a random individual is susceptible or infected at time @xmath0 ? 3 .",
    "what is the probability a randomly chosen test individual is susceptible or infected at time @xmath0 ?",
    "to begin our calculations we start with @xmath62 , the probability that a stub belonging to an age @xmath63 test individual @xmath51 has never been involved in a transmission to @xmath51 .",
    "once we know that , then the probability a test individual of age @xmath63 and @xmath52 partners is susceptible at time @xmath0 is @xmath64 .",
    "averaging this over the entire population of age @xmath63 individuals the probability an age @xmath63 individual is susceptible is @xmath65 where we recall @xmath66 , and the @xmath67 factor in the second term accounts for the fact that the individual would be infected at @xmath60 with probability @xmath7 .",
    "the focus of our calculations is on determining @xmath71 . as a boundary condition we have @xmath72 stating that when an individual is first introduced , it has not yet received any infection .",
    "similarly we have the initial condition @xmath73 as well , stating that prior to the disease introduction , no transmissions have occurred .",
    "the change in @xmath74 in a time step is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the probability that the stub has not previously brought infection to @xmath51 and connects to an infected partner at the start of the time step .",
    "so we have @xmath77 however to do this calculation we require @xmath78 which is still unknown . we can shift our unknown from @xmath76 to @xmath79 ( the probability the stub has not transmitted to @xmath51 and currently connects to a susceptible partner ) by using @xmath80    as in calculating @xmath8 , to calculate @xmath79 , we turn it into a sum .",
    "the probability that a partnership created when @xmath51 joined still exists is @xmath81 .",
    "the probability that a partnership has some smaller age @xmath82 is @xmath83 .",
    "so @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the probability that a stub belonging to an age @xmath63 individual that is part of an age @xmath82 edge has not transmitted by time @xmath0 and @xmath86 is the probability that a stub is freed to find a new partnership ( either by death of the partner , or termination of the partnership ) .",
    "the one term outside the sum represents the fact that when the individual first enters the population the stub definitely forms a partnership .",
    "we now find @xmath87 .",
    "if the edge formed when @xmath51 was born ( @xmath88 ) then this is simply the probability the partner @xmath89 is susceptible given that @xmath89 has an age @xmath63 partnership with @xmath51 , which we denote @xmath90 . however , if the edge formed after @xmath51 was born ( @xmath91 ) , then @xmath85 is the probability @xmath92 that the stub was not responsible for transmitting infection to individual @xmath51 prior to the current partnership forming times @xmath93 . as @xmath94",
    "these coincide when @xmath95 , so we can write @xmath96    we now find @xmath93 similarly to @xmath97 .",
    "it is @xmath98 if @xmath99 , then we know that @xmath89 was born either when the disease was introduced or earlier . thus no previous partnership could have transmitted to @xmath89 .",
    "if we assume @xmath100 , then the probability @xmath89 is susceptible is the probability that it escaped infection when the disease was introduced @xmath67 times the probability that it has not been infected by any other partners .",
    "because of how @xmath89 is selected ( it is @xmath51 s partner ) , @xmath89 is likely to have a higher degree than a randomly selected individual .",
    "the probability @xmath89 has degree @xmath101 is @xmath102 .",
