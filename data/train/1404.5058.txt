    "dark fluid composed of a dark energy and a dark matter is considered nowadays as a key constitutive element of modern cosmological models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both the dark energy and dark matter are assumed to consist of electrically neutral particles and thus the dark fluid does not interact with an electromagnetic field _ directly_. that is why , we would like , first of all , to explain the terminological context , which allows us to speak about electrodynamic phenomena induced by the dark fluid .",
    "let us imagine a hierarchical cosmological system , in which the dark fluid ( energetically dominating substrate with a modern contribution about @xmath0 ) is considered to be the guiding element , and an electrodynamic subsystem ( as a part of baryonic matter with its modern contribution about @xmath1 ) to be the subordinate element . in this context",
    "the electrodynamic subsystem plays the role of a _ marker _ , which signalizes about the variations in the state of dark fluid , the energetic reservoir , into which this marker is immersed .",
    "we are interested to answer the question : what mechanisms might be responsible for a ( possible ) transmission of information about the dark fluid state to the electrodynamic system .",
    "since electrodynamic systems form the basis for the most important channel of information about the universe structure , one could try to reconstruct features of the dark fluid evolution by tracking down specific fine details of the spectrum of observed electromagnetic waves , of their phase and group velocities .",
    "the most known _ marker - effect _ of such type is the polarization rotation of electromagnetic waves travelling through the axionic dark matter @xcite .",
    "let us remind a few details of this phenomenon . from the physical point of view , the corresponding mechanism is connected with magneto - electric cross - effect @xcite , which is generated in the medium by the pseudoscalar field associated with dark matter axions . from the mathematical point of view , this mechanism is described by inserting a special term into the lagrangian , @xmath2 , which is linear in the pseudoscalar ( axion ) field @xmath3 and is proportional to the pseudo - invariant of the electromagnetic field quadratic in the maxwell tensor @xcite .",
    "the model of this axion - photon coupling was extended for the non - stationary state of the dark matter ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and for the states , for which nonminimal effects linear in the space - time curvature are significant ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "availability of the example of the coupling of photons with the dark matter axions encourages us to search for marker - effects related to the interaction of electrodynamic system with the dark energy , the main constituent of the dark fluid .",
    "we assume that electrodynamic systems can be influenced by the pressure of the dark energy in analogy with mechanical stresses , which are known to control the response in electric and magnetic materials in industry and technique . to be more precise",
    ", we can search for dark fluid analogies with the following classical effects .",
    "first , we mean the analogy with the classical piezo - electric effect ( the appearance of an electric polarization in the medium influenced by mechanical stress and vice - versa ) , and with the classical piezo - magnetic effect ( appearance of a magnetization under stress)(see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , we would like to consider an analogy with the inverse electrostriction effect ( a combination of external pressure and electric field generates the electric polarization in the medium ) , and an analogy with the inverse magnetostriction effect ( a combination of external pressure and magnetic field generates the magnetization in the medium ) , as well as , an analogy with the magneto - electric cross - effect displayed by the external stress . based on results of classical electrodynamics of continuous media , we can expect that piezo - effects will be visualized , when the dark fluid is anisotropic ( e.g. , in the early universe ) .",
    "the striction effects due to their symmetries are expected to be available in the isotropic universe also .",
    "in addition to piezo- and striction- effects induced by the dark fluid pressure we can expect the appearance of marker - signals similar to pyro - electric and pyro - magnetic responses of the medium , in which the temperature changes with time @xcite ( pyro - effect also is hidden , when the dark fluid is isotropic ) .",
    "one of the important characteristic of the dark fluid is its macroscopic velocity four - vector and covariant derivative of this four - vector .",
    "when we focus on the influence of the dark fluid non - uniform motion on the properties of electrodynamic system , we , in fact , search for analogs of dynamo - optical phenomena @xcite ; we hope to consider these phenomena in detail in the next paper . in principle",
    ", we could consider an analogy with the so - called thermo - electric and thermo - magnetic effects , induced by heat - fluxes in the medium , but this sector of physical modeling is out of scope of this paper .",
    "also , in this paper we do not consider magneto - electric cross - effects induced by the combination of the dark energy pressure and of the axionic dark matter .",
    "effects of this type are worthy of special consideration .",
    "we have to emphasize that mathematical theory of pyro- , piezo- and striction- effects is developed in detail for classical electrodynamics of continuous media , and below we consider a general relativistic extension of that theory for the case of dark fluid action on the electrodynamic system . in this sense , we take the mathematical scheme of the description of such interactions , which is well - tested , has clear interpretation and is based on the lagrange formalism , and then we construct its general relativistic analog , using this scheme in the context of dark fluid electrodynamics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we remind the terminology and introduce the lagrangian and master equations for the model of electromagnetically inactive dark fluid .",
    "section iii contains detailed description of the extended model : in section iii.a we extend the lagrangian by the terms , which describe interactions of the pyro- , piezo- and striction- types between dark energy and electrodynamic system ; in section iii.b we derive extended electrodynamic equations and discuss the structure of tensor coefficients describing pyro- ( iii.b.1 ) , piezo- ( iii.b.2 ) and striction-(iii.b.3 ) coefficients associated with the coupling to dark energy ; in section iii.c we obtain the extended gravity field equations in general form . in section iii.d",

    "generally , it can not be presented in an explicit form by means of the energy density @xmath37 and of the dark energy pressure @xmath164 , and its reconstruction requires sophisticated phenomenological decomposition ( [ sym2 ] ) . however ,",
    "when we treat the dark energy as a spatially homogeneous isotropic medium using an analogy with some scalar field @xmath210 , we obtain @xmath143 by direct variation procedure ( see ( [ de7 ] ) ) , thus providing the model to be self - closed .",
    "moreover , we find that , when we restrict our - selves by the striction - type interactions only , i.e. , @xmath338 , the electrodynamic equations include the scalar @xmath164 only , and the gravity field equations include @xmath164 and the combination @xmath339 only .",
    "it follows from ( [ de5 ] ) that the sum @xmath340 does not feel the shape of the potential @xmath341 ; as for the dark energy pressure @xmath164 , it , clearly , depends on @xmath341 .",
    "this fact confirms that modeling of striction - type extensions of master equations for the electromagnetic and gravitational fields by means of a scalar dark energy is sensitive to the choice of the scalar field potential .",
    "based on the method of one - loop corrections to potentials of complex or real scalar fields attributed to the dark energy , dark matter or dark fluid , the authors of the works @xcite have shown that these scalar field potentials are usually stable under quantum fluctuations , however , a coupling to fermions is very restricted .",
    "when we consider an electrodynamic system influenced by a scalar dark energy , we have to take into account these results keeping in mind two aspects .",
    "first , the scalar field potential @xmath341 attributed to the dark energy ( see ( [ de1 ] ) ) can be modified due to one - loop corrections along the line discussed in @xcite ; since this potential enters the formula for the pressure of the dark energy ( see ( [ de5 ] ) ) , these corrections can re - define the coupling constants of the striction - type interaction discussed above .",
    "second , the electrodynamic system inevitably contains electrically charged fermions ; when the fermion mass @xmath342 depends on the scalar field , @xmath343 , we can use directly the method and estimations discussed in @xcite . as for ( possible ) dependence of the photon mass on the scalar field",
    "@xmath210 , this problem is worthy a special attention and will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "let us apply the method used in @xcite to the anti - gaussian model discussed in subsection v.b . according to ( [ pi1 ] ) and ( [ de5 ] ) )",
    ", we readily obtain that @xmath344 thus providing the scalar field @xmath210 to be linear function of the cosmological time @xmath345 : @xmath346 then , using ( [ de4 ] ) ) and ( [ de5 ] ) ) we see that the potential @xmath347 is a quadratic function of the scalar field : @xmath348 where @xmath349 @xmath350 } - c \\psi(t_0 ) \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath351 for the function ( [ loop3 ] ) the second derivative of the potential is @xmath352 , thus the formula ( 2 ) from @xcite gives us the one - loop modification of the scalar potential ( [ loop3 ] ) @xmath353 ^ 2 \\ , , \\label{loop5}\\ ] ] where @xmath354 and @xmath355 are the ultra - violet cutoffs of the scalar and fermion fluctuations , respectively ; @xmath343 is @xmath210-dependent fermion mass , which appears in the lagrangian of matter @xmath11 ( see ( [ 0actmin ] ) ) , when the matter is considered to consist of fermions ( see ( 1 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , being constant , the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ loop5 ] ) can be absorbed by the constant @xmath356 appeared in the potential ( [ loop3 ] ) ; the authors of the works @xcite indicate such a case as describing the potential stable under scalar fluctuations . as for estimations of the potential stability related to fermion fluctuations ,",
    "the third term in ( [ loop5 ] ) is exactly the same as the one in ( 2 ) of the paper @xcite ; this means that estimations discussed in section iii of @xcite are also valid .",
    "let us repeat , that estimations related to the scalar field coupling to photons and gravitons based on one - loop corrections require a special consideration and , unfortunately , are out of frame of this paper .",
    "let us consider the consequences of the scalar field potential modification , given by the second term in the right - hand side of ( [ loop5 ] ) , for the unlighted epochs formation .",
    "in fact , this constant one - loop correction to the quadratic potential leads to the following formal re - definition of the parameter @xmath357 in ( [ pi3 ] ) : @xmath358 then we have to replace the parameter @xmath357 with this new parameter @xmath359 in all inequalities , which predetermine the structure of the unlighted epochs ( see sections v.b1 , v.b2 , v.b3 , v.b4 ) .",
    "let us illustrate the consequences of such pressure re - definition by the examples , for which @xmath360 and @xmath357 is positive ( see , e.g. , ( [ pi689 ] ) , ( [ un3 ] ) , ( [ un5 ] ) ) .",
    "since the second term in ( [ loop6 ] ) is negative , we can imagine that @xmath359 becomes negative due to such scalar potential correction .",
    "this means that the inequalities ( [ pi689 ] ) ( with the replacement @xmath361 ) remain valid , so that this veto for the unlighted epoch appearance holds out .",
    "the inequalities ( [ un3 ] ) and ( [ un5 ] ) ) are not valid now , therefore , the corresponding unlighted epochs of the second and third types become forbidden because of scalar fluctuations . in other words ,",
    "the answer on the question about absence or presence of the unlighted epochs seems to be very sensitive to the choice of the scalar field potential and to its one - loop corrections .",
    "\\1 . a new model of coupling between a cosmic dark fluid and electrodynamic systems",
    "is established , i.e. , the extended lagrangian is introduced and the extended master equations are derived for electromagnetic and gravitational fields . what is the novelty of this model from the mathematical point of view ?",
    "first , we introduced four cross - terms into the lagrangian , which contain the maxwell tensor up to the second order , on the one hand , and contain the pressure tensor of the dark energy and the convective derivative of its energy - density scalar , on the other hand .",
    "thus , a modified lagrangian is not of pure field - type , since these cross - terms are the products of pure field - type elements ( @xmath5 ) and of quantities defined algebraically ( see ( [ fluid ] ) , ( [ 1fluid ] ) for the definitions of @xmath33 , @xmath37 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "second , we described a modified procedure of variation with respect to the metric , which happened to be necessary for these new cross - terms defined algebraically .",
    "this modified procedure is based on the rule of variation of the macroscopic velocity four - vector ( [ 11t1 ] ) taken from the works @xcite ; on the rule of algebraic decomposition of the second variation of the dark energy lagrangian ( [ s2])-([sym3 ] ) , and on the ansatz about the structure of this decomposition in the case of spatially isotropic medium ( see ( [ de6])-([de8 ] ) )",
    ".    \\2 . what is the physical motivation of the lagrangian extension , which we made ? since we follow the mathematical scheme , which is well - known in the relativistic electrodynamics of continuous media , we indicate the new cross - terms in the extended lagrangian ( [ actmin ] ) using the similar terminology : as ( dark energy inspired ) analogs of terms describing electric and magnetic striction , piezo - electricity and piezo - magnetism , pyro - electricity and pyro - magnetism .",
    "this analogy allowed us to interpret new coupling constants as ( dark energy induced ) pyro- , piezo- and striction coefficients , respectively .",
    "first cosmological application of the model shows that a striction - type interaction between the dark energy and test electrodynamic system provides the phase and group velocities of electromagnetic waves to become sophisticated functions of cosmological time . in the asymptotic regime , at @xmath362 ,",
    "these functions tend to the speed of light in vacuum , i.e. , @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "however , during the universe evolution the so - called unlighted epochs can appear , for which the effective refraction index of the cosmic medium is an imaginary quantity .",
    "at the boundary points of these unlighted epochs the group velocity of the electromagnetic waves takes zero value , so the electromagnetic energy transfer stops .",
    "the last unlighted epoch ( if such epochs have ever existed in the real universe ) should finish before the so - called recombination era , as far as , cosmic microwave background composed of relic photons traveling freely is observable . in our terms",
    "this means that the characteristic time @xmath365 is less than @xmath366 . using ( [ pi4 ] ) , ( [ un2 ] ) ,",
    "( [ pi3 ] ) at @xmath367 and the condition @xmath368 , we obtain a cosmological constraint @xmath369 linking the phenomenological parameter of a striction - type coupling @xmath318 , the value of the refraction index @xmath370 at the end of the recombination era , and the value of the dark energy pressure @xmath371 at that moment . it is only one example of constraints appearing in this model ; we intend to discuss other constraints in a special note .    \\5 .",
    "the criteria of existence of the unlighted epochs are very sensitive to the choice of the scalar field potential , which one uses for modeling of the dark energy .",
    "we have illustrated this sentence on the example of the anti - gaussian model .",
    "in particular , taking into account one - loop corrections to the dark energy scalar field potential , one can show , that scalar fluctuations are able to avoid the unlighted epoch formation .",
    "we expect that the established model can provide new interesting results in application to the anisotropic bianchi - i cosmological model , since in this period of the universe evolution pyro - magnetic and piezo - magnetic effects can appear in addition to the magneto- striction effect admissible both on the anisotropic and isotropic stages of the universe expansion .    *",
