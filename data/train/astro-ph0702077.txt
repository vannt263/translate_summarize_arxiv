    "it is currently believed that pulsars are among the few objects in our galaxy that are candidate sources of ultrarelativistic charged cosmic rays .",
    "relativistic particles within the magnetosphere emit @xmath0-rays at energies up to several gev in various processes such as curvature radiation , synchrotron radiation and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "thus , observations in the multi - gev @xmath0-ray domain allow one to study the acceleration sites in the magnetosphere of a pulsar . predicted sites where particle acceleration can take place are , for example , above the polar cap of the neutron star ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the so - called outer gap of the magnetosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , particle acceleration can take place outside the magnetosphere in the region where the pulsar wind interacts with the interstellar medium . if electrons are accelerated in these shocks , they could give rise to ic - scattered photons from , for example , the cosmic microwave background , synchrotron radiation , or thermal origin .",
    "psr b1951 + 32 was detected first at radio frequencies by @xcite , and is one of the six rotation - powered high energy pulsars whose gev emission was detected by egret @xcite . among @xmath0-ray pulsars , psr b1951 + 32 is the only source observed to emit up to @xmath8gev with no cutoff being evident in the differential energy spectrum .",
    "the spectrum shows a hard spectral index of 1.8 between @xmath9mev and @xmath8gev .",
    "the pulsar has an apparent high efficiency ( @xmath10 ) of converting its rate of rotational energy loss , @xmath11ergs@xmath12s@xmath5 , into @xmath0-rays above @xmath9mev ( assuming a distance of @xmath13kpc to the pulsar ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-ray luminosity at @xmath14gev is comparable to that of the crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "as inferred from its rotational parameters , the spin - down age of psr b1951 + 32 is @xmath15yr @xcite , that is ,  about 100 times older than the crab pulsar .",
    "the magnetic field strength of @xmath16 g @xcite is lower than that in most rotation - powered pulsars . because of the lower magnetic field",
    ", curvature @xmath0-rays emitted near the stellar surface , as predicted in polar - cap models , are less affected by magnetic pair production . compared with younger , more strongly magnetized pulsars ,",
    "the spectral cutoff energy is thereby shifted to higher energies , up to a few tens of gev ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a discussion of low - field millisecond pulsars ) .    on the contrary ,",
    "if the @xmath0-rays are emitted in the outer magnetosphere , as predicted in outer gap models , the potential drop in the outer gap of psr b1951 + 32 is expected to be comparable to that of young pulsars ( see eq .  [ 12 ] of @xcite and eq .  [ 2.1 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the cutoff energy , which reflects the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons or positrons accelerated in the outer gap , is expected to be around 10gev @xcite .",
    "thus , features in the predicted spectral shape of weakly magnetized pulsars at energies above 10gev are strongly dependent on the emission altitudes . in order to discriminate between emission models , psr b1951 + 32",
    "is a prime candidate for observation by ground - based @xmath0-ray detectors with low energy thresholds such as the imaging air cherenkov telescope magic .",
    "this pulsar is located in the core of the radio nebula ctb 80 , which is thought to be physically associated with the pulsar . in x",
    "- rays the nebula shows a cometary shape @xcite , being confined by a bow shock that is produced by the pulsar s high proper motion ( @xmath17 km s@xmath5 ) @xcite . @xcite",
    "predict an over-@xmath18gev flux from the nebula at a level of @xmath19 of the crab s flux , by assuming that high - energy leptons can accumulate inside the well - localized nebula for long periods of time , as observed in the case of the crab nebula .",
    "the current tightest constraint on the emission above @xmath9gev from the pulsar and its nebula , obtained by the whipple collaboration @xcite , puts an upper limit of @xmath2gev on the cutoff energy of the pulsed emission and an upper limit of @xmath20@xmath4s@xmath5 , on the steady emission above @xmath21gev .",
    "the latter is within a factor @xmath22 of the prediction of @xcite .       in polar - cap models ,",
    "the cutoff energy is determined by the attenuation of @xmath0-rays due to magnetic pair production and hence by the emission altitude of @xmath0-rays . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy spectrum above the cutoff energy is superexponentially attenuated .",
    "if the emission altitude in the polar cap model shown in figure [ 1951_pulsar ] changes from 1 to 2 stellar radii , the cutoff energy will increase from 20gev to 60gev , which is , according to our observations , the maximum allowed cutoff energy for a superexponentially shaped cutoff . on the contrary , in outer - gap models ,",
    "the cutoff is determined by the maximum lorentz factor of the accelerated positrons and electrons . as a consequence ,",
    "the cutoff of the @xmath0-ray spectrum is smoother , resulting in an exponential cutoff .",
    "if the magnetic field lines near the light cylinder are straighter than assumed for the outer - gap spectrum in figure [ 1951_pulsar ] , the predicted flux below 60gev will increase .    for more precise predictions of the cutoff energy in polar - cap models ,",
    "multidimensional and self - consistent electrodynamics have to be examined from first principles , whereas a three - dimensional magnetic field configuration has to be investigated in the outer - gap model .",
    "assuming that these improvements in theory will be achieved in the near future , measurements with higher statistics around @xmath23gev , for example , by glast , or measurements by future ground - based experiments with lower thresholds than magic , for example , magic ii or the cherenkov telescope array , will be needed in order to distinguish between models .",
    "the predicted ic flux at tev energies in the outer - gap model ( figure [ 1951_pulsar ] _ solid black line _ ) appears to be inconsistent with our upper limits .",
    "nevertheless , it must be noted that the ic flux is obtained by assuming that all the magnetospheric soft photons illuminate the equatorial region of the magnetosphere in which the gap - accelerated positrons are migrating outwards .",
    "therefore , the predicted ic flux as a function of energy specifies an upper boundary to the possible pulsed tev emission .",
    "the open poloidal magnetic field lines could have a single - signed curvature within 1.8 light - cylinder radii , as the solution of the time - dependent force - free electrodynamics of an oblique rotator indicates @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , soft photons emitted inside the light cylinder along the convex magnetic field lines will not efficiently illuminate the magnetic field lines , which are slightly convex even outside the light cylinder . as a result",
    ", the predicted ic flux at tev energies will be significantly reduced .",
    "this problem will be solved in future when the self - consistent gap electrodynamics @xcite and the three - dimensional force - free electrodynamics are combined .",
    "we are grateful for the preparation of the ephemeris of psr b1951 + 32 by andrew lyne , thus enabling us to perform the pulsed analysis .",
    "alice harding was so kind as to provide us with her polar - cap predictions of psr b1951 + 32 .",
    "we also would like to thank the instituto de astrofisica de canarias for the excellent working conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , in la palma . the support of the german bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung and the max - planck - gesellschaft , the italian istituto nazionale de fisica nucleare , the spanish comisin interministerial de ciencias y tecnologa , eth research grant th 34/04 3 , and grant 1p03d01028 from the polish ministerstwo nauki",
