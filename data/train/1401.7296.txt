    "the symmetric simple exclusion process ( to which we sometimes refer simply as _ the simple exclusion _ ) is one of the simplest particle system with local interactions .",
    "it can be considered as a toy model for the relaxation of a gas of particle and was introduced by spitzer in @xcite . since then",
    ", it has been the object of a large number of studies by mathematicians and theoretical physicists , who investigated many of its properties such as the evolution rules for the particle density and tried to derive fick s law from microscopic dynamics , studied to motion of an individual tagged particle ( see @xcite for reviews on the subject and references therein ) .",
    "more recently @xcite an interest has been developed for the convergence to equilibrium of the process on a finite graph in terms of mixing time , which is the object of our study .",
    "we consider @xmath4 , the discrete circle with @xmath0 sites and place @xmath5 particles on it , with _ at most _ one particle per site . with a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we sometimes use elements of @xmath6 to refer to elements of @xmath7 .",
    "the simple exclusion on @xmath7 is a dynamical evolution of the particle system which can be described informally as follows : each particle tries to jump independently on its neighbors with transition rates @xmath8 , but the jumps are cancelled if a particle tries to jump on a site which is already occupied ( see figure [ partisys ] in section [ fluctuat ] for a graphical representation ) .    more formally , our state - space is defined by @xmath9 given @xmath10 define @xmath11 the configuration obtained by exchanging the content of site @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14    the exclusion process on @xmath7 with @xmath15 particle is the continuous time markov process on @xmath16 whose generator is given by @xmath17 the unique probability measure left invariant by @xmath18 is the uniform probability measure on @xmath19 which we denote by @xmath20 . given @xmath21 we let @xmath22 denote the trajectory of the markov chain starting from @xmath23 .",
    "we want to know how long we must wait to reach the equilibrium state of the particle system , for which all configurations are equally likely .",
    "we measure the distance to equilibrium is measured in terms of total variation distance .",
    "if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two probability measures on @xmath19 , the total variation distance between @xmath24 and @xmath26 is defined to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the positive part of @xmath12 .",
    "it measures how well one can couple two variables with law @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we define the worst - case distance to equilibrium at time @xmath29 as follows @xmath30 similarly we define the typical distance from equilibrium at time @xmath29 as @xmath31 for a given @xmath32 we define the @xmath33-mixing - time ( or simply the mixing time when @xmath34 ) to be the time needed for the system to be at distance @xmath33 from equilibrium @xmath35 let us mention that the convergence to equilibrium has also been studied in terms of asymptotic rates : it has been known for a long time ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 12.6 ) ) that for any reversible markov chain @xmath36 exists and that @xmath37 is the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath38 , usually referred to as the spectral gap .",
    "note that the knowledge of the spectral - gap also give an information on @xmath39 for finite @xmath40 , as we have ( cf .",
    "@xcite[theorem 12.3 ] ) @xmath41    the exclusion process can in fact be defined on an arbitrary graph and its mixing property have been the object of a large number of works .",
    "let us mention a few of them here .",
    "let us start with the mean - field case : in @xcite , the study of the exclusion on the complete graph with @xmath42 particles is reduced to the study of the birth and death chain and a sharp asymptotic for the mixing time is given using a purely algebraic approach ( see also @xcite for a probabilistic approach of the problem for arbitrary @xmath15 ) .",
    "the problem on the lattice is much more delicate .",
    "let us mention a few results that were obtained on the torus @xmath43 : in @xcite ( and also independently in @xcite ) , comparisons with the mean - field model were used to prove that @xmath44 , and thus via that there exists a constant @xmath45 such that @xmath46    in @xcite , the related problem of the _ log - sobolev constant _ for the process was studied . in particular , in @xcite ,",
    "a sharp bound ( up to multiplicative constant ) on the log - sobolev constant was proved for the exclusion process on the grid which allowed to improve into @xmath47 in @xcite , using the _ chameleon process _ , this upper bound is improved in the case of small @xmath15 by showing that @xmath48 ( see also @xcite where the technique is extended to obtain estimates on the mixing time for arbitrary graphs in terms of the mixing time of a single particle ) .    in another direction : in @xcite , it is shown that the spectral gap for the simple - exclusion on any graph is equal to that of the underlying simple random walk ( e.g.  in our case @xmath49 ) .    finally concerning the case of dimension @xmath50 : in @xcite , the mixing time of the exclusion process on the segment is proved to be larger than @xmath51 and smaller than @xmath52 , with the conjecture that the lower bound is sharp .",
    "this conjecture was proved in @xcite .",
    "the first result of this paper is a sharp asymptotic for the mixing time of the exclusion process on the circle @xmath7 . for a fixed @xmath53 ,",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath15 goes to infinity we are able to identify the asymptotic behavior of @xmath54 .",
    "we obtain that when @xmath55 ( which by symmetry is not a restriction )    @xmath56    note that here the dependence in @xmath33 is not present in the asymptotic equivalent .",
    "this means that on a time window which is @xmath57 the distance to equilibrium drops abruptly from @xmath50 to @xmath58 .",
    "this sudden collapse to equilibrium for a markov chain was first observed by diaconis and shahshahani @xcite in the case of the ( mean - field ) transposition shuffle ( see also @xcite for the random walk on the hypercube ) .",
    "the term cutoff itself was coined in @xcite and the phenomenon has since been proved to hold for a diversity of markov chains ( see e.g.  @xcite for some recent celebrated papers proving cutoffs ) .",
    "it is believed that cutoff holds with some generality for reversible markov chains as soon as the mixing time is much larger than the inverse of the spectral gap , but this remains a very challenging conjecture ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 18 ) for an introduction to cutoff and some counterexamples and @xcite for recent progress on that conjecture ) .",
    "a natural question is then of course : `` on what time scale does @xmath39 decrease from , say , @xmath59 to @xmath60 ? '' .",
    "this is what is called the cutoff window .",
    "we are able to show it is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "let us mention that , this is result is , to our knowledge , the first sharp derivation of a cutoff window for a lattice interacting particle system .",
    "[ mainres ] for any sequence @xmath1 satisfying @xmath61 and tending to infinity .",
    "we have for every @xmath62 @xmath63 more precisely we have    @xmath64    and the window is optimal in the sense that for any @xmath65 @xmath66    the result above can be reformulated in the following manner : @xmath67 the second line states that the cutoff window is at most @xmath3 while the third implies not only that this is sharp , but also that one the time scale @xmath3 , the `` cutoff profile '' has infinite support in both directions",
    ".    our result does not cover the case of a bounded number of particles .",
    "in this case there is no cutoff and the mixing time is of order @xmath3 for every @xmath33 with a pre - factor which depends on @xmath33 ( a behavior very similar to the random - walk : case @xmath68 ) .",
    "we also show that on the other - hand that starting from a typical configuration , the relaxation to equilibrium is not abrupt and occurs on the time - scale @xmath3 .",
    "[ secondres ] for any sequence @xmath1 satisfying @xmath61 and tending to infinity , we have for all @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71    note that we will not prove that @xmath72 which would complete the picture by showing that the system does not mix at all before the @xmath3 time - scale",
    ". however we point out to the interested reader that such a result can be obtained combining ingredients of section [ lowerbounds ] together with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) which asserts that the fluctuations of @xmath73 defined in are asymptotically gaussian .",
    "the convergence of @xmath74 when @xmath0 tends to infinity remains an open question .",
    "let us , in this section , briefly sketch the proof or at least recall the ingredients used in @xcite to derive the cutoff for the exclusion on the segment @xmath75 .",
    "the state - space of particle configuration on the segment comes with a natural order @xmath76    we set @xmath77 it turns out that not only this order is preserved by the dynamics in a certain sense ( see @xcite but also @xcite ) , and but it has additional properties : if @xmath78 denotes the maximal configuration for then @xmath79 is an increasing function ( for any @xmath40 ) ; we also have positive correlation of increasing events ( a.k.a  the fkg inequality after @xcite ) .",
    "these monotonicity properties are first used to show that after time of @xmath80 , starting the dynamics from @xmath78 , we can couple a finite dimensional ( _ i.e. _ whose dimension remains bounded when @xmath0 grows ) projection of @xmath81 together with the corresponding equilibrium distribution .",
    "the monotonicity is then used again to check that the peres - winckler censorship inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) is valid in our context .",
    "the latter result establishes that , if one starts from the maximal configuration for the order described in , ignoring some of the updates in the dynamics only makes the mixing slower ( as shown in @xcite , this can fail to be true if there is no monotonicity ) .",
    "we use this statement to show that the system mixes in a time much smaller than @xmath82 once a finite projection is close to equilibrium .",
    "this method establishes a sharp upper bound ( at first order ) for the mixing time starting from @xmath78 and some additional work is necessary to show that this is indeed the worse initial condition ( we refer to the introduction @xcite for more details ) .      in the view of the previous section ,",
    "the proof in @xcite for the mixing time for the exclusion on the segment heavily relies on monotonicity arguments in every step of the process .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it is not very robust , and can not be used for either higher dimension graphs ( for instance @xmath83 with either free or periodic boundary condition ) .",
    "it even breaks down completely if one allows jump between site @xmath50 and @xmath0 .    with this in mind , our idea when studying the exclusion on the circle is also to develop an approach to the problem which is more flexible , and could provide a step towards the rigorous identification of the cutoff threshold in higher dimensions ( see section [ higherdef ] for conjectures and rigorous lower - bounds ) .",
    "this goal is only partially achieved as , even if we do not require monotonicity , a part of our proof relies on the interface representation of the process ( see section [ fluctuat ] ) which is a purely one - dimensional feature .",
    "however let us mention that a @xmath84 dimensional generalization of proposition [ smallfluctu ] can be shown to remain valid for @xmath85 .",
    "a missing ingredient in higher dimension is thus a coupling which allows to couple particle configuration with typical fluctuation with equilibrium in a time of order @xmath3 .",
    "another positive point is that by relying much less on monotonicity , we are able to prove statements about the mixing time starting from an arbitrary position ( cf . theorem [ secondres ] ) instead of focusing only on the extremal ones .    finally note that the method developed in this paper gives more precise results than the one in @xcite as we identify exactly the width of the cutoff window ( and it also extends to the segment ) .",
    "however , we could not extract from it the asymptotic mixing time for the adjacent transposition shuffle , which seem to require novel ideas .    in @xcite , by combining the technique of the present paper with some aditionnal new ideas ,",
    "the author improved theorem [ mainres ] by describing the full cutoff profile , that is , identified the limit of @xmath86 .",
    "proposition [ smallfluctu ] as well as the multiscale analysis used in section [ multis ] play a crucial role in the proof .      in section [ lowerbounds ]",
    "we prove the part of the results which corresponds to lower - bounds for the distance to equilibrium , that is to say , the first lines of and .",
    "the proof of this statement is very similar to the one proposed by wilson in @xcite , the only significant difference is that we have to work directly with the particle configuration instead of the height - function .",
    "doing things in this manner underlines that the proof in fact does not rely much on the dimension ( see section [ higherdef ] ) . while the proof does not present much novelty , we prefer to mention it in full as it is relatively short and it improves the best existing bound in the literature ( see @xcite ) .    the main novelty in the paper is the strategy to prove upper - bound results ( second lines of and ) . in section [ pubdecompo ]",
    "we explain how the proof is decomposed . in section [ arratia ] ,",
    "we use a comparison inequality of liggett @xcite to control the ( random ) fluctuations of the local density of particle after time @xmath87 .",
    "finally we conclude by showing that configuration which have reasonable fluctuations couples with equilibrium within time @xmath88 , using interface representation for the particle system , and a coupling based on the graphical construction .",
    "the construction is detailed in section [ fluctuat ] , and the proof is performed using a multi - scale analysis in section [ multis ] .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove the some lower bounds on the distance to equilibrium . following the method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) , we achieve such a bound by controlling the first two moments of the first fourier coefficient of @xmath89 .",
