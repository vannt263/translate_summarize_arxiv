    "increasing the efficiency of thermoelectric materials for heat - work conversion is one of the main challenges of present - days technology  @xcite . in this context",
    "the search for efficient nanoscale heat engines and refrigerators has stimulated a large body of activity , recently reviewed in ref .  .",
    "progresses in understanding thermoelectricity at the nanoscale will also have important applications for ultra - sensitive all - electric heat and energy transport detectors , energy transduction , heat rectifiers and refrigerators , just to mention a few examples .",
    "one of the keys to the success in this field is the ability to modulate , control , and route heat and charge currents , ideally achieving their separate control  @xcite .",
    "this is however by no means obvious as the charge and ( the electronic contribution to ) the heat are transported by the same carriers . in two - terminal systems , for example , within the linear response regime , electrical and thermal currents are strictly interrelated , as manifested by the emergence at low enough temperatures of the wiedemann - franz law  @xcite . indeed",
    ", when the temperature is the smallest energy scale in the system ( that is , if the sommerfeld expansion holds ) one finds that the ratio @xmath1 , involving the @xmath2 @xmath3 and the @xmath4 @xmath5 conductances at temperature @xmath6 is universal and it is given by the lorenz number @xmath7 .",
    "the fulfillment of the wiedemann - franz law , one of the triumphs of sommerfeld s theory of metals , has important consequences in determining the efficiency of thermoelectric engines .",
    "for a two terminal setup the only way to increase the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath8 , the dimensionless parameter that fully describes the efficiency for thermoelectric conversion , is by increasing the thermopower ( @xmath9 ) , which is however bounded to be small at small @xmath6  @xcite .        in order to achieve a separate control of heat and charge currents one should therefore consider more complex ( multi - terminal ) devices .",
    "the key issue in this context is to assess to which extent this control can be achieved and what are its possible advantages in thermoelectric thermal machines . in this paper",
    "we push to its extreme this type of control and explore a situation where heat and charge currents flow in spatially separated parts of the system .",
    "namely , we will enforce that one of the terminals allows only charge current and another one allows only heat current , and name this regime as _ heat - charge current separation _ ( hccs ) .",
    "it is worth stressing already at this point that the regime of hccs is realised notwithstanding the fact that the same carriers are responsible for heat and charge flow .",
    "as we will discuss in details in the paper , hccs can be naturally realised by employing superconducting reservoirs .",
    "nonetheless , this is not a strict requirement : indeed , in principle one could spatially separate heat and charge currents in an all - normal multi - terminal device . in this case , however , a fine tuning of the parameters characterising the thermoelectric transport needs to be performed thus making the device not easy to realise experimentally .",
    "recent investigations of multi - terminal setups  @xcite have shown that such devices offer great potentialities in terms of efficient thermoelectric conversion . in the majority of these works",
    "all but two terminals were considered as probes , i.e. no net flow of energy and charge through them was allowed .",
    "in other works a purely bosonic reservoir was added to the standard two terminals , only exchanging energy with the system . a generic three - terminal setup , where all reservoirs are fermionic ( possibly exchanging both charges and heat with the system ) ,",
    "was considered in ref .   where it was shown that the third terminal can be used to increase both the extracted power and the efficiency of a thermal machine .",
    "so far the impact of superconducting reservoirs on the performance of thermoelectric devices has not been considered  @xcite .",
    "we start filling this gap by studying hccs and thermoelectric conversion in a three - terminal hybrid normal metal - superconducting device .",
    "the three - terminal device which implements hccs , pictorially shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spn ] , is composed of a generic conductor connected to a superconducting reservoir ( s ) , a normal metal reservoir ( n ) and a second normal reservoir whose chemical potential is set to inhibit the flow of electrical current , thus acting as a voltage probe ( p ) .",
    "this setup , to which we will refer to as spn , _ naturally _ realises heat - charge current separation . indeed , a voltage probe exchanges ( on average ) by definition only heat ( energy ) with the system ,",
    "whereas the superconductor , being a poor heat conductor for temperatures below the gap , can exchange only charges .",
    "this way , the heat and charge currents , flowing together out of the normal metal reservoir ( n ) , are split and driven either towards the voltage probe ( heat ) , or towards the superconducting reservoir ( charge ) . in the linear response regime this setup has the advantage of admitting an effective description in terms of a @xmath10 onsager matrix , a feature which allows _",
    "inter alia _ a natural way of comparing its performance to that of a standard two - terminal configuration .",
    "using the scattering approach , we will show on general grounds that this separation allows , in the linear response regime and at small temperatures , to greatly enhance the performance of a thermal machine , namely increasing both the efficiency and the output power by roughly one order of magnitude with respect to a standard two - terminal counterpart .",
    "the root of this enhanced efficiency can be traced back to the possibility to violate in a controlled fashion the wiedemann - franz law in the heat - charge separation regime . on more general grounds",
    "it is worth to stress that the simultaneous presence of superconducting _ and _ normal terminals , by selectively controlling the heat and charge flows through normal and andreev scattering , introduces new degrees of freedom that are worth being explored for thermoelectric conversion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the necessary formalism and define the regime of heat - charge current separation .",
    "we then show how this regime can be attained by having one of the three terminals in the superconducting state . in order to test the performance of this thermal engine we perform an extensive analysis in section  [ sec : results ] , by varying the properties of the scattering region connecting the three reservoirs . by properly parametrising the scattering matrix",
    "we sample randomly the scatterer and compare the efficiency of the hccs thermal machine with that of a  conventional \" two - terminal setup ( sections  [ sec : violation ] and  [ sec : performance ] ) .",
    "we complete our analysis in section  [ sec : dots ] by discussing the case of systems consisting of quantum dots ( qds ) .",
    "the reason to study these examples in detail is to show that it is possible to achieve , in experimentally realisable situations , those enhanced performances that we found in the first part of section  [ sec : performance ] .",
    "indeed we see that our theoretical findings can be tested with current experimental capabilities .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "some technical details related to the scattering formalism in the presence of andreev scattering are summarised in the appendices .",
    "let us consider a system composed of a conductor attached to three leads",
    ". within the linear response regime charge and heat currents are governed by the onsager matrix @xmath11 via the relation @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) represent the charge ( heat ) current entering the conductor from lead @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ( n , p ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spn ] .",
    "we define the biases @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the chemical potential and temperature , respectively , relative to reservoir @xmath16n , p and having chosen the reservoir s as reference with temperature @xmath6 and chemical potential @xmath21 .",
    "heat and charge currents flowing in lead s can be determined from the conservation of particle and energy currents .",
    "as already mentioned , hccs consists in spatially separating heat and charge flows . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : spn ] heat will only flow in lead p while charge will only flow in lead s. in this section we characterise this regime and discuss how to implement it .",
    "on general grounds hccs can be realised whenever two  probe \" terminals  @xcite are present , one for the voltage and one for the temperature .",
    "in fact , a voltage probe is a terminal whose voltage is adjusted in order for the charge current to vanish , while a temperature probe is a terminal whose temperature is adjusted in order for the heat current to vanish ( see app .",
    "[ app - vp ] ) . unlike a voltage probe , which is implemented simply by opening the electric circuit , making a thermal probe would require the ability to control and measure heat currents which is still very challenging in practice ( although important advancements in the measurements of heat currents at the nanoscale have been recently achieved , see refs .  ) .",
    "a natural way of realising hccs is to replace the thermal probe with a superconducting lead which intrinsically suppresses the heat flow for low enough voltages and temperatures . on the contrary",
    "a normal metal - superconductor interface is an excellent electrical conductor due to the andreev process that allows to carry charge current in the sub - gap regime . in the following",
    "we will detail the working principles of this implementation .",
    "let us consider eq .   and",
    "take the superconducting reservoir as the reference .",
    "assuming temperatures much smaller than the superconducting gap and using the scattering formalism ( see app .",
    "[ app : lbsc ] ) one can demonstrate that the coefficients on the fourth row ( column ) of the onsager matrix eq .",
    "are the opposite of the corresponding coefficients on the second row ( column ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath22 which , at first order in linear response , yields @xmath23 by virtue of the energy conservation . in other words",
    ", it is an intrinsic property of the hybrid scattering matrix to have vanishing heat current in the superconducting lead .",
    "these observations allow us to simplify the onsager system of equations by eliminating the redundant forth row and column , thus reducing it to a 3 by 3 problem : @xmath24 where we have introduced @xmath25 ( or equivalently @xmath26 ) .",
    "now we impose the voltage probe condition @xmath27 on reservoir p , which yields @xmath28 by substituting eq .   into eq .",
    "one obtains a two - terminal - like onsager matrix : @xmath29 for the sake of simplicity , in the following we drop the primes for the onsager coefficients @xmath30 in eq .  .",
    "from the definitions of the local  @xcite and non - local  @xcite transport coefficients , one can introduce ( local ) conductances and ( non - local ) thermopowers described by the following two - terminal - like expressions : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 importantly , we can express the efficiency for heat to work conversion with the standard two - terminal formula  @xcite @xmath34 one can also define the figure of merit @xmath35 and the power factor @xmath36 .",
    "the former gives information about the maximum efficiency and the efficiency at maximum power  @xcite @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the carnot efficiency , while the latter about the maximum power @xmath39 . with these formulas",
    "the analogy between the spn system and the two - terminal one is complete , allowing us to compare their performance .",
    "as we shall show in this section , the heat - charge separation implemented through the spn setup allows to control @xmath3 and @xmath5 separately",
    ". this will be at the origin of the enhancement of both the figure of merit @xmath0 and the power factor @xmath40 with respect to the two - terminal setup .",
    "we will use the landauer - bttiker scattering formalism  @xcite , which is summarised in app .",
    "[ app : lbsc ] for multi - terminal hybrid superconducting systems .",
    "we begin our analysis by considering low temperatures ( within the sommerfeld expansion ) and studying a well - defined class of scattering matrices .",
    "quasiparticle transmission from the normal leads into the superconductor is exponentially suppressed and thus can be ignored .",
    "thus the scattering probabilities entering eq .   just involve reservoirs n and p.    in the following we will express the conductances ( electrical and thermal ) as well as the thermopower as functions of the parameters characterising the scattering matrix . the aim is to sample this parameter space in order to make a statistical analysis of the thermoelectric performance . assuming a single channel per spin per lead , in the bogoliubov - de gennes formalism ( see app .",
    "[ app : lbsc ] ) the total scattering matrix @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "supposing that there are no spin - mixing terms , it can be written in a diagonal block form @xmath43 where the basis is @xmath44 , where the operator @xmath45 @xmath46 destroys ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath47 in lead @xmath48 .",
    "the matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related by the particle - hole symmetry relations ( see app .",

    "we assume the latter to be real , i.e. it can be written as @xmath61 where we made explicit the dependence on the energy @xmath62 .",
