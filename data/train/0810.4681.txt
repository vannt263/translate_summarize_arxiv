    "furthermore , silicon has some limitations in speed of operations .",
    "these restrictions lead to serious challenges for the moore s law which states that the number of transistors can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit has increased exponentially , doubling approximately every two years .",

    "<S> we present numerical calculations of the impact of charge carriers - carriers interactions on the dynamical properties of quasiparticles such as renormalized velocity and quasiparticle inelastic scattering lifetime in a gapped graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism is based on the many - body @xmath0-approximation for the self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for the many - body renormalized velocity suppression and the renormalization constant over a broad range of energy gap values . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the renormalized velocity is almost independence of the carrier densities at large density regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the quasiparticle inelastic scattering lifetime decreases by increasing the gap value . finally , we present results for the mean free path of charge carriers suppression over the energy gap values .    </S>",
