    "alice and bob , however , want to know exactly which cards the other holds .",
    "moreover , they do not want for cath to learn who holds _ any _ card whatsoever , aside of course from her own cards .",

    "first , the cards are dealt beforehand in a secure phase which we treat as a black box and gives the players no information about others cards .",
    "the agents have no communication before this phase and can not share secrets ( such as private keys ) .",
    "second , the agents have unlimited computational capacity .",
    "this means , on one hand , that solutions via encryption are not valid , provided they are vulnerable to cryptanalisis ( independently of its computational cost ) .",
    "it also means that we shall not be concerned with the feasibility of agents strategies , although this is certainly an important line for future inquiry .",
    "third , all strategies are public knowledge , in keeping with kerckhoffs principle @xcite .",
    "these assumptions turn the problem into a challenging combinatorial puzzle .",
    "a ( possible ) solution to the generalized russian cards problem is a _ protocol ; _ these shall also be discussed formally in section [ sec.some ] .",
    "the solution we propose is , to the best of our knowledge , the first solution to the generalized russian cards problem which works in cases where cath holds more cards than alice .",
    "the russian cards problem itself originates with kirkman @xcite .",
    "there , the solution takes the form of a _ design _ , a collection of subsets of a given set that satisfies certain regulaties @xcite .",
    "the design consists of seven triples .",
    "cryptography based on card deals is also investigated in various other ( not necessarily related ) publications , such as @xcite .",
    "many instances of the generalized russian cards problem have been studied .",
    "we remark that all of these protocols obtain a notion of security called",
    "_ weak @xmath8-security _ by swanson and stinson @xcite , the notion we are concerned with in this paper . a stronger and more general notion of _ perfect @xmath9-security _",
    "is also considered by them but we shall not treat it here .",
    "the known solutions are as follows .    1 .",
    "the original @xmath10 case has been extensively studied and has many solutions @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath11 has a three - step solution given in @xcite , where it is also shown that there is no two - step solution .",
    "all cases @xmath12 provided @xmath13 have been solved in @xcite .",
    "4 .   all cases @xmath14 with both @xmath15 have been solved in @xcite .",
    "5 .   if @xmath16 then there is a solution for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath14 with @xmath18 subsumes the case @xmath19 for @xmath20 , also covered previously in @xcite ; @xcite demonstrates that , for the stronger notion of perfect 1-security , every announcement in a @xmath19 solution is a steiner triple .",
    "they have yet another characterization result for perfect @xmath9-security .",
    "our main contribution is to provide solutions for infinitely many cases where @xmath5 and either @xmath21 or @xmath4 , the first known solutions for @xmath22 .",
    "we remark that all but one of the previously known protocols are two - step protocols , whereas our protocol is in four steps . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that there can be no two - step solution if @xmath23 .",
    "as we provide solutions with @xmath22 , the protocol we propose is longer .",
    "we do not know if a shorter , three - step variant is possible .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "sec.some ] formalizes our model of security and our notion of protocol .",
    "section [ seccolp ] gives an informal description of the protocol , in order to motivate the more specific description given in definition [ def.colprotocol ] .",
    "this protocol depends on certain parameters which do not exist for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "the conditions under which such parameters exist are treated in section [ line ] .",
    "finally , section [ suitable ] computes explicit bounds on the parameters for which the protocol is executable .",
    "in this section we shall present the notion of _ protocol _ we shall use . throughout this paper , we assume that @xmath24 is a fixed , finite set of `` cards '' . a _",
    "card deal _ is a partition @xmath25 of @xmath24 ; the deal has",
    "@xmath6 if @xmath26 is an @xmath0-set , @xmath27 a @xmath1-set and @xmath28 a @xmath2-set , where by `` @xmath29-set '' we mean a set of cardinality @xmath29 .",
    "the set of @xmath29-subsets of @xmath30 is written @xmath31 .",
    "we think of @xmath26 as the _ hand _ of alice , or that alice _ holds @xmath26 _ ; similarly , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the hands of bob and cath , respectively . in general",
    "we may simply assume that @xmath32 , and define @xmath33 to be the set of partitions of @xmath24 of size @xmath6 .",
    "central to this text is the notion of _ protocol . _",
    "roughly , a protocol is a family of rules or instructions that alice and bob must follow in order to send out a sequence of public announcements .",
    "protocols are in principle non - deterministic , assigning only a probability measure to the announcements that an agent may make .    in @xcite and other papers",
    ", an announcement has been modelled as a set of hands that one of the agents may hold .",
    "thus alice would announce a subset @xmath34 of @xmath35 , indicating that @xmath36 . more specifically , an announcement is a pair @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the agent making the announcement ( either alice or bob ) .",
    "but for our proposed solution , agents announcements are not in one - one correspondence to subsets of @xmath35 .",
    "because of this , it will be simpler to model announcements as elements of a countable or finite set , say @xmath39 ; a similar setup is proposed in @xcite , where alice enumerates all subsets of @xmath35 by @xmath40 and merely announces the appropriate subindex .",
    "thus we let @xmath41 be the set of announcements , where @xmath42 .",
    "a sequence of announcements @xmath43 is a _",
    "run_. we shall write @xmath44 for the set of runs , including the empty sequence .    an ( unusual ) assumption of the problem is that there is a secure dealing phase which we treat as a black box .",
    "initially , a card deal is selected randomly and players have knowledge of their own cards and of the size @xmath6 of the deal , but know nothing more about others cards .",
    "thus they are not able to distinguish between different deals where they hold the same hand .",
    "we model this by equivalence relations between deals ; since from alice s perspective , @xmath25 is indistinguishable from @xmath45 , we define @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 .",
    "we also define analogous equivalence relations for bob and cath .    in @xcite ,",
    "swanson and stinson define strategies of length two as assigning a probability distribution to alice s possible announcements ( after which bob announces cath s hand ) , and consider @xmath48-equitable strategies as a special case where alice always has @xmath48 possible announcements each with probability @xmath49",
    ". we will work with _",
    "equitable _ strategies ( and merely call them _ protocols _ ) , where probability is distributed evenly among the possible outcomes but the number of outcomes is left unspecified .",
    "this will allow us to dispense with probability measures and only determine a set of possible announcements at each stage of the protocol .",
    "on the other hand , we consider protocols which may have more than two steps , making our definition more elaborate than swanson and stinson s .",
    "[ defprot ] let @xmath50 .",
    "a _ protocol _ ( with @xmath6 as parameters ) is a pair of functions @xmath51 assigning to every deal @xmath52 and every run @xmath53 an agent @xmath54 and a finite set @xmath55 such that if @xmath56 , then @xmath57 .    thus once",
    "a deal has been given , a protocol assigns to each run a player who is to make the next announcement and a set of possible announcements for the player to make .",
    "these announcements are determined exclusively by the information an agent has access to , which is assumed to be _ only _ ( _ i _ ) their hand , ( _ ii _ ) the parameters @xmath58 , ( _ iii _ ) the announcements that have been made previously and ( _ iv _ ) the protocol being executed .",
    "protocols are non - deterministic in principle and hence may be executed in many ways ; an _ execution of a protocol _ is a pair @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a deal , @xmath61 a run and , for all @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64    the first property that a protocol needs to have in order to be successful is for its set of executions to be non - empty .",
    "this observation seems trivial but it will occupy a large portion of the paper .    given a natural number @xmath65 , a protocol is _",
    "@xmath65-executable _ if for every deal @xmath60 there is an execution @xmath59 where @xmath66 has length @xmath65 .",
    "we may omit the parameter @xmath65 and let it be given by context ; the protocol we propose has four steps so we take @xmath67 .",
    "the second property that a protocol must have to be successful is that alice and bob know each other s cards ( and hence the entire deal ) after its execution :    an execution @xmath68 is informative for alice if there is no execution @xmath69 with @xmath70 .    similarly , an execution @xmath68 is informative for bob if there is no execution @xmath71 with @xmath70 .",
    "a protocol is informative if there exists @xmath65 such that the protocol is @xmath65-executable and every execution of length @xmath65 is informative both for alice and for bob .",
    "the third property is that , given a card @xmath29 which cath does not hold , she should consider it possible that either alice holds it or bob holds it :    [ w1s ] an execution @xmath68 of a protocol @xmath51 is _ safe _ if for every @xmath72 there is    1 .",
    "a deal @xmath73 such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 is also an execution of @xmath51 , as well as 2 .",
    "a deal @xmath76 such that @xmath77 and @xmath78 is also an execution of @xmath51 .",
    "the protocol @xmath51 is safe if every execution of @xmath51 is safe .",
    "safety is equivalent to _",
    "weak @xmath8-security _ as defined by swanson and stinson @xcite , but this is not the only notion of security they discuss .",
    "weak security is equivalent to the statement that for all @xmath28 , @xmath79 and every execution @xmath80 of the protocol , @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 denotes conditional probability ) .",
    "stronger notions of security would demand that cath does not gain probabilistic information , so that @xmath83 ( perfect @xmath8-security in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will only be concerned with weak security .",
    "in this section we shall describe the general colouring protocol , the central focus of this article . before we do so , let us briefly describe some of the notation we shall use .    we will use @xmath84 to denote a prime or a power of a prime , and @xmath85 the field with @xmath84 elements .",

    "we denote by @xmath91 the set of all lines in @xmath87 .",
    "the theory of finite fields and finite geometries has been extensively studied ; see , for example , @xcite .    for natural numbers",
    "@xmath92 we define @xmath93 to be the sum @xmath94 . we know from basic algebra that @xmath95 this will be a very useful quantity to keep in mind ; for example ,    given @xmath96 , there are @xmath97 distinct lines passing through @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath84 be a prime or a prime power and @xmath98 .",
    "assume that alice holds as many cards as points in a line of @xmath87",
    "( i.e.  @xmath99 ) and that alice , bob and cath together hold as many cards as points in the whole space ( i.e.  @xmath100 ) .",
    "let @xmath101 be a set of @xmath9 colours , identified with the numbers @xmath102 .",
    "colourings will be a crucial element in our protocol :    [ def.colouring ] a _ @xmath9colouring _ is a function @xmath103    that is , @xmath104 assigns a colour from @xmath105 to each line in @xmath87 .",
    "let us now give an informal account of the protocol ; definition [ def.colprotocol ] will give a formal version and section [ line ] will study its executability .",
    "it consists of the following four steps :    1 .",
    "alice maps all the cards into @xmath87 in such a way that her cards form a line and announces the mapping .",
    "2 .   bob announces a _ suitably chosen _ @xmath9-colouring @xmath104 .",
    "alice announces the colour of her hand according to @xmath104 .",
    "4 .   bob announces cath s cards .    of course",
    ", we have yet to specify what a suitable colouring is .",
    "this will be the focus of the rest of this section . in order to guarantee that the protocol is informative ( alice and bob can deduce the card deal after the protocol s execution )",
    ", the colouring must be _ distinguished _ , as defined below . for it to be safe",
    "( cath can not learn any of alice or bob s cards ) , the colouring should also be _",
    "rich_. however , colourings which are merely rich and distinguished may give cath too much information , and thus we will have to replace the condition of being distinguished by the stronger version of being _ very distinguished .",
    "_ once we have defined these notions the next question is for which @xmath58 and @xmath9 such colourings exist , i.e. , when the protocol is executable ; this shall be the topic of later sections .",
    "first let us focus on making the protocol be informative .",
    "given a card deal @xmath25 , we should design @xmath104 in such a way that only @xmath26 itself can be the line entirely contained in @xmath106 of whichever colour alice announces . in this way , bob can unequivocally identify @xmath26 .",
    "but there may be many such spaces contained in @xmath107 , and at the beginning of the protocol bob has no way of telling them apart .",
    "thus we arrive at the following :    we say that a @xmath9colouring @xmath104 is _ distinguished _ for a set @xmath108 if no two distinct lines contained entirely in @xmath109 have the same colour .",

    "the left picture shows a @xmath110-colouring that bob announces after alice maps the cards into @xmath111 . throughout the examples we will continue to use black squares for alice s cards , white circles for bob s and black triangles for cath s , so that cards held by alice or cath are black - filled shapes .",
    "alice s cards @xmath26 form the line @xmath112 .",
    "cath s cards @xmath28 are @xmath113 .",
    "the set @xmath107 also contains the line @xmath114 .    in order to enable alice , by her later response , to distinguish between the lines",
    ", bob announces the @xmath110-colouring in the the left picture .",
    "it has two ` colours ' : solid lines and dashed lines .",
    "ellipses in the figure are lines as well , e.g. @xmath115 is a dashed line .",
    "suppose alice announces that her line is solid .",
    "then , bob will learn alice s cards and he can announce cath s cards .",
    "but the colouring that bob announces is not safe .",
    "after alice announces that her cards are a solid line , cath discards all solid lines that meet some of her points .",
    "the right picture in figure  [ fig : notrich ] shows the only two lines that cath can not discard .",
    "this makes cath learn that alice has @xmath116 and that bob has @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "hence , colourings that are merely distinguished will make the colouring protocol informative but not necessarily safe . to remedy this",
    ", we must have enough colours , and the colouring must be rich enough , so that for every card that cath does not hold she should consider it possible both that alice holds it and that alice does not hold it .",
    "[ defrich ]    a @xmath9colouring @xmath104 is _ rich _ ( or @xmath2rich ) if for any @xmath2-set @xmath28 , colour @xmath38 , and point @xmath72 , there is an @xmath38-coloured line @xmath26 containing @xmath29 that avoids @xmath28 and there also is an @xmath38-coloured line @xmath119 not containing @xmath29 that avoids @xmath28 .",
    "rich and distinguished colourings are _ almost _ suitable , but we shall need an extra condition . notice that cath knows that bob is to design the colouring so that it turns out to be informative .",

    "we have so far worked under the assumption that the protocol is executable .",
    "the rest of the paper will be devoted to examining when this is the case , and determining the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "in what follows we will look for conditions to guarantee the existence of a rich and very distinguished @xmath9colouring for some number of colours @xmath9 .",
    "first , let us introduce the notion of _ density : _",
    "say a @xmath9colouring @xmath104 has _ density _",
    "@xmath182 if , given a point @xmath183 and a colour @xmath38 , there are at least @xmath182 @xmath38coloured lines through @xmath29 .",
    "there is a close connection between density and richness ; to be precise , a colouring that is dense enough is automatically rich .",
    "[ notmeeting ] if @xmath104 is a @xmath9colouring of density @xmath184 , then @xmath104 is rich .",
    "let @xmath109 be a subset of @xmath185 with @xmath2 elements .",
    "fix a colour @xmath38 and a point @xmath186 .",
    "we note that if @xmath122 are two distinct lines passing through @xmath29 , then @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , @xmath109 contains the disjoint union @xmath188 it follows that for some @xmath90 with @xmath189 and @xmath190 , @xmath191 must be empty , otherwise @xmath109 would have at least @xmath184 elements .",
    "similarly , if we pick @xmath192 different from @xmath29 , we see that there is an @xmath38-coloured line through @xmath89 not meeting @xmath193 , satisfying the second requirement .",
    "thus in order to construct rich colourings , we may focus on constructing dense colourings ; this is not too difficult , as witnessed by the following :    [ knitlemm ] let @xmath194 be distinct lines of @xmath195 and assume that @xmath196 then , there is a @xmath9colouring @xmath104 of density @xmath182 such that for @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "there are @xmath199 non - collinear vectors in @xmath185 , and hence we can pick a set @xmath24 of @xmath200 non  collinear vectors which are not directing vectors of any of the lines @xmath201 .",
    "partition @xmath24 into @xmath9 disjoint sets @xmath202 of @xmath182 elements .",
    "then , given a line @xmath203 , put @xmath204 if either @xmath205 or @xmath178 has directing vector in @xmath202 for some @xmath206 .",
    "otherwise put , for instance , @xmath207 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath104 satisfies the desired properties .",
    "this will be sufficient for finding rich colourings .",
    "now our goal is to construct a very distinguished @xmath9colouring for @xmath106 . as with richness",
    ", we will do so by introducing a stronger , approximate notion  that of a _",
    "perfect colouring_. it is not easy to tell under which conditions very distinguished colourings exist or how one may go about finding one , but finding perfect colourings will be straightforward .",
    "the notion of a perfect colouring has the disadvantage that perfection is not hue - invariant . to deal with this issue",
    ", we will first need an intermediate concept : that of _ critical colourings .",
    "_ every perfect colouring is critical and every critical colouring is very distinguished .",
    "perfect colourings are the easiest to identify , but critical colourings are easier to work with than either perfect or very distinguished colourings .",
    "let us then begin by defining critical colourings :    [ def : criticalcol ] given @xmath208 , we say that a @xmath9-colouring @xmath104 is _ critical _ for @xmath109 if there exists a set @xmath209 of different colours such that , for every line @xmath210 , we have @xmath211 where @xmath212 stands for the cardinality of a set @xmath213 .",
    "we will say the lines in @xmath214 are _",
    "@xmath104-critical lines _ for @xmath109 .",
    "the notion of critical colouring in definition  [ def : criticalcol ] captures an important difference between the @xmath110-colourings in figures  [ fig:2colouring ] and  [ fig:2colvery ] .",
    "the @xmath110-colouring in figure  [ fig:2colouring ] is not critical for @xmath215 , as for any set of lines @xmath214 that we can select , there is a line @xmath178 such that @xmath216 as the reader may verify by examination .    on the other hand ,",
    "the colouring in the left - hand side of figure  [ fig:2colvery ] is critical for @xmath215 , the union of the two lines and the fragment .",
    "we select @xmath214 as the two complete lines in @xmath109 .",
    "then , for any line @xmath178 , the property of definition  [ def : criticalcol ] holds .",
    "in particular , the line @xmath178 with the three holes is the line outside of @xmath214 with most points in @xmath109 . for that line , @xmath217    recall example  [ exam:2colouring ] , where we showed that the colouring in figure  [ fig:2colouring ] is unsafe .",
    "intuitively , the insecurity of a @xmath9-colouring ( in figure  [ fig:2colouring ] we have @xmath218 ) is produced because @xmath219 contains @xmath9 lines , along with a line fragment @xmath90 with @xmath9 or less gaps  observe the line missing @xmath84 and @xmath132 in figure  [ fig:2colouring ] .",
    "then , though the @xmath9-colouring is distinguished , it might not be very distinguished , as we may be able to use several swaps to move the @xmath9 lines and fill all the gaps in @xmath90 , thus generating @xmath220 lines and repeating a colour .",
    "however , when @xmath107 contains @xmath9 or less lines and all fragments have more than @xmath9 points missing , then a distinguished @xmath9-colouring @xmath104 is always very distinguished .",
    "figure  [ fig:2colvery ] shows an example of this situation .",
    "-colouring , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] -colouring , title=\"fig:\",width=170 ] -colouring , title=\"fig:\",width=94 ]    in the left - hand side of figure  [ fig:2colvery ] , @xmath107 contains two lines and a fragment with three or more points missing .",
    "alice has one of these lines , and cath has the other line plus the segment .",
    "then , a swap corresponds to moving a line to an empty position of the same colour , and it is not possible to arrange the two lines in @xmath107 in such a way that they fill the three gaps in the fragment .",
    "thus there is no configuration of the same hue for which @xmath104 is not distinguished , so that @xmath104 is very distinguished .",
    "the above considerations suggest that critical colourings are very distinguished , and indeed this will turn out to be the case .",
    "before we show this , let us make a simple observation :    [ isexc ] if @xmath104 is a critical @xmath9colouring for @xmath109 and @xmath123 , then @xmath90 is a @xmath104critical line for @xmath109 , independently of how the other critical lines are chosen .",
    "let @xmath221 be @xmath104-critical lines for @xmath109 .",
    "notice that since they are lines of different colours , we have @xmath222",
    ". if @xmath90 is not @xmath104critical then for every @xmath223 , @xmath224 is either empty or a singleton .",
    "it therefore follows that    @xmath225 which contradicts the definition of a critical @xmath9colouring .",
    "now we will check that critical colourings are very distinguished . for this",
    ", it suffices to show that they are distinguished and that a critical colouring for @xmath109 is critical for the entire hue of @xmath109 ; the former is straightforward , the latter rather involved .",
    "[ placeisnet ] every critical @xmath9colouring for @xmath109 is distinguished for @xmath109 .    from lemma [ isexc ]",
    "it follows that if @xmath123 then it is critical ; but there is at most one critical line of each colour so there can not be @xmath226 of the same colour both contained in @xmath109 .",
    "[ break ] suppose @xmath104 is a critical @xmath9-colouring for @xmath109 with @xmath227 and @xmath129 has the same hue as @xmath109 .",
    "then , @xmath104 is also a critical colouring for @xmath129 .",
    "we shall prove this by induction on the number of swaps between @xmath109 and @xmath129 .",
    "the base case ( @xmath228 ) is vacuous . for the inductive step , suppose @xmath229 with @xmath230 and @xmath231 one swap closer to @xmath109 than @xmath129 is , so that by induction we may assume that there are @xmath104-critical lines @xmath232 for @xmath231 with @xmath222 .",
    "observe that @xmath233 ; indeed , @xmath234 , so that by lemma [ isexc ] , @xmath235 for some @xmath38 .",
    "but @xmath236 , and therefore @xmath237 .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath104 is also critical for @xmath129 ; we will do this by proving that the lines @xmath238 defined by @xmath239 for @xmath240 and @xmath241 are critical . for this it will suffice to check",
    "that if @xmath90 is any line , @xmath242 this inclusion would then imply that @xmath243 showing that @xmath238 ( and hence @xmath104 ) are critical for @xmath129 .    to establish ( [ claim ] ) , pick @xmath244 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath245 , except perhaps in the case that @xmath246 .",
    "but @xmath247 , so this can not be , and therefore we always have @xmath245 .",
    "next , we need to check that @xmath248 for any @xmath197 .",
    "this is obvious if @xmath240 , since @xmath249 .",
    "thus it remains to rule out that @xmath250 .",
    "if we had @xmath251 , we would also have that @xmath252 .",
    "but @xmath129 does not intersect this set , so this is impossible .",
    "we conclude that ( [ claim ] ) holds , and thus @xmath104 is critical for @xmath129 , as desired .",
    "as promised , we now have the following :    [ critisdis ] every critical colouring is very distinguished .",
    "if @xmath104 is critical for @xmath109 , then by lemma [ break ] , it is also critical for every set of the same hue as @xmath109 ; thus , by lemma [ placeisnet ] , it is also distinguished for every such set .",
    "we have seen that in order to construct very distinguished colourings , it suffices to construct critical colourings .",
    "this has the advantage that the notion of being critical depends only on a set @xmath109 and not on the entire hue of @xmath109 .",
    "however , it is still not entirely obvious when exactly critical colourings exist or how one is to go about building one .",
    "this is where perfect colourings come into play . although perfect colourings are not perfect for their entire hue , they are very easy to identify , and every perfect colouring is automatically critical .",
    "[ def : perfectcol ] given @xmath208 , let @xmath253 denote the set of all lines @xmath90 such that @xmath254 .",
    "we say that a @xmath9-colouring @xmath104 is _ perfect _ for @xmath109 if different elements of @xmath255 have different colours .",
    "perfect colourings , when they exist , are quite easy to identify and construct , yet they are always very distinguished :    [ isasafe ] if @xmath104 is a perfect colouring for @xmath109 , then @xmath104 is very distinguished for @xmath109 .",
    "first we note that @xmath104 is critical , since we can take all of @xmath255 as critical lines , given that they are all of different colour .",
    "then , by lemma [ critisdis ] , we have that @xmath104 is very distinguished , as required .    now for the main result of this section :    [ mainline ] assume that @xmath256 satisfy the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 is a prime or a prime power , 2 .",
    "@xmath135 , 3 .",
    "@xmath257 , 4 .   for every @xmath258 with @xmath259 ,",
    "we have @xmath260 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath261 .",
    "then , the colouring protocol is executable .",
    "assume that alice has announced @xmath140 and for this proof let @xmath262 denote the images of each player s hand under @xmath140 . by assumption , @xmath263",
    ", so bob can enumerate @xmath264 by @xmath265 , with @xmath266 . then , by lemma [ knitlemm ] , there exists a colouring @xmath104 with density @xmath184 and such that @xmath198 , which by construction is perfect for @xmath107 , so that by proposition [ isasafe ] , it is also very distinguished .",
    "further , by lemma [ notmeeting ] , we see that @xmath104 is rich , as needed .",
    "the above proof should be seen as a theoretical argument that very distinguished colourings exist under the above conditions  but never as an algorithm for constructing them .",
    "it is essential for our protocol that bob choose randomly among all possible colourings .",
    "we leave the specification of feasible algorithms for doing so for future work .",
    "the conditions given by theorem [ mainline ] , while rather general , remain somewhat implicit . in this subsection",
    "we shall compute some explicit bounds on the parameters which guarantee that these conditions are met .",
    "the computations we will make are a bit rough , but will nevertheless give us a large family of parameters for which the protocol is guaranteed to work .",
    "they are based on the following counting lemma :    [ lastlemm ] if a set @xmath267 is such that @xmath268 then @xmath269    we argue by contrapositive , assuming that @xmath270    let @xmath271 be distinct lines such that @xmath272 .",
    "then , we have @xmath273    thus in view of theorem [ mainline ] , in order to find suitable parameters , it suffices to solve the system of inequalities    1 .",

    "@xmath275    or , simplifying a bit ,    1 .",

    "@xmath278 and @xmath279 or 2 .",
    "@xmath280 and @xmath281 .    in view of theorem",
    "[ mainline ] and lemma [ lastlemm ] , it suffices to show that the above inequalities hold .",
    "for the first result , set @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",

    "the colouring protocol we have presented gives a new and flexible solution to the generalized russian cards problem .",
    "our protocol solves the problem in many cases where the eavesdropper has more cards than one of the players , and is the first known solution to achieve this .",
    "if the generalized russian cards problem is to be understood as _ find triples @xmath6 for which a safe and informative protocol of any length exists , _ then the current work is a giant stride over what had been previously achieved .",

    "alice may have more than one line , there may be more players , cath may be allowed to learn a few of the cards , etc .",

    "this could , potentially , reduce the size of the whole space ( and hence bob s hand ) without compromising the existence of suitable colourings .",
    "a different direction to pursue involves cases where either @xmath0 or @xmath3 are not prime powers .",
    "there are already standard techniques to deal with these ; one finds a prime which is not much larger than the desired parameter and works with that instead .",
    "such techniques have already been used to extend a different protocol to many new triples in @xcite but have not been worked out in our context .    meanwhile",
    ", the generalized russian cards problem may have a recreational flavour to it , but it has potential for serious applications in secure communication .",
    "these protocols have an advantage over most traditional encryption methods in that they are `` unconditionally secure '' , meaning that an eavesdropper is unable to decipher messages even when granted unlimited computational capacity .",
    "the presupposition of a `` dealing stage '' is not so different to authentication systems using security tokens , where the user receives a physical device that generates one - time passwords .",
    "a possible application is the development of challenge - response authentication systems .",
    "the user bob is authenticated against the server alice by running a russian cards protocol .",
    "if alice checks that bob s responses are coherent with the key he should have ( bob s hand ) then the authentication succeeds .",
    "real - world implementation of these protocols would also require an additional computational and probabilistic analysis .",
    "what is the complexity of running the colouring protocol ?",
    "are there good algorithms for finding suitable colourings ?",
