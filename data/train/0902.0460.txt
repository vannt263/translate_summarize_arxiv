    "the observation of the kondo effect in quantum dots allows a direct insight on this interesting many - body effect , whose experimental fingerprint is the enhanced differential conductance at @xmath7 bias which is a specific type of @xmath7 bias anomaly .",
    "the great advantage over the bulk kondo effect is of course the possibility to control the parameters like for instance the coupling with the leads .",
    "next , it was shown that even more information can be extracted if the dot is connected to three leads .",
    "the three lead - kondo problem was theoretically considered before in , e.g. , @xcite and experimentally realized by leturcq et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "the third lead was used to read the non - equilibrium density of states ( dos ) induced by the other two leads .",
    "shah and rosch @xcite analyzed the influence of the coupling and bias on the decoherence rate .    in this paper",
    ", we also study the many - lead quantum dots in kondo regime , but the focus is different : we are interested to find out the conditions under which the differential conductance can show a suppression at _ zero _ bias instead of the usual enhancement .",
    "there are well - known examples of transport properties influenced by dips in the spectral function produced by coulomb interactions .",
    "the first one was the coulomb pseudo - gap in the impurity conduction of doped semiconductors resulting in the @xmath8 dependence of the hopping conductivity@xcite .",
    "then , a zero bias anomaly manifested as a dip in tunneling dos was studied in tunnel junctions@xcite . however , what is conspicuous for the three - lead quantum dots ( see sketch in fig.2 ) , is that a peak - dip crossover may appear in the differential conductance , while keeping the dot permanently in kondo regime . as we show in the next section , this occurs when the bias is applied asymmetrically on the left and right leads , and the crossover is triggered by the degree of asymmetry . for",
    "the sake of definiteness , let us assume that for some voltage configuration ( see sketch in fig.2 ) , the left lead receives electrons from the central lead and pumps electrons into the right lead , the difference of the two contributions being the total current .",
    "for the conductances , one can write @xmath9 . both @xmath10 and @xmath11 must decay by applying a voltage @xmath0 ( as the voltage destroys the kondo resonance and reduces the electronic tunneling between leads ) , but not necessarily with the same derivative ; then , if @xmath12 the conductance @xmath13 will increase with @xmath0 , giving rise to a dip about @xmath14 .",
    "it will also be shown that the peak - dip crossover can be used to determine the ratio between the couplings of different leads to the dot , and therefore it is of potential experimental use .",
    "the main conclusions of the paper are extracted from the current formula given by the keldysh formalism ( eq.1 ) by taking advantage of a simple connection between the convexity of the conductance @xmath15 and the convexity of the density of states .",
    "recently , in the first two - channel kondo experiment @xcite , a dip generated by the competition between channels was observed in the differential conductance , even in the case of symmetrically applied bias .",
    "one may note that in our calculations , as in the mentioned ( theoretical and experimental ) papers referring to the 3-lead problem @xcite , the set - up and physics are different , and therefore the results are outside the multi - channel kondo phenomenology .    for the illustration of the results , we shall give also some numerical calculations using the equation of motion solution for the anderson hamiltonian @xcite , generalized to the multi - lead and non - equilibrium case .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the behavior of the conductance close to equilibrium , for the case when two of the leads are biased and the others are grounded . in this case , all the grounded leads have the same chemical potential ( set to @xmath7 ) and act like one single reservoir ; this reservoir will be called `` central lead '' ( with the chemical potential @xmath22 ) .",
    "if we apply the potential @xmath23 on the left lead @xmath24 and the potential @xmath25 on the right lead @xmath26 , then the differential conductance through the lead @xmath24 can be calculated from eq.1 : @xmath27d\\omega}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that only the derivative of the fermi function was considered while the derivative of @xmath28 versus bias was neglected , which was proven to be a very good approximation in @xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "when the derivatives of the fermi functions approximate delta functions , the above formula turns into : @xmath29\\ ] ] and similarly : @xmath30\\\\ { \\mathcal g_c}(v)&=&\\frac{d i_c}{d v}=-\\frac{4e^2\\delta_c}{\\pi \\hbar \\delta } [ -\\delta_l img_{dd}(ev)-\\lambda \\delta_r img_{dd}(\\lambda ev)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the conductance @xmath31 , defined in this way is a quantity that can be measured experimentally and helps for determining the coupling ratios as we shall see below .",
    "we suggest now a way to search for kondo dips in the differential conductance .",
    "one has to compute the second derivative of @xmath31 for @xmath14 which contains the convexity information ( in case the first derivative vanishes , the convexity determines if one has a peak or a dip ) .",
    "the second derivative of the differential conductance can be expressed as : @xmath32\\\\ { \\mathcal g_r}''(0)=-\\frac{4e^4\\delta_l\\delta_r}{\\pi \\hbar \\delta } img_{dd}''(0)\\big[(1+\\frac{\\delta_c}{\\delta_r})\\lambda^3 - 1\\big]\\\\ { \\mathcal g_c}''(0)=\\frac{4e^4\\delta_c\\delta_r}{\\pi \\hbar \\delta } img_{dd}''(0)\\big[\\frac{\\delta_l}{\\delta_r}+\\lambda^3\\big];\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above formulas @xmath33 is the second derivative of the spectral function at equilibrium ( i.e. for @xmath14 ) and is always negative for @xmath34 indicating the presence of the kondo peak in the density of states .",
    "this property will be used to determine the peak or dip behavior of the conductance .",
    "the distribution ( and sign ) of the conductances in the three - lead device is controlled by the coupling to the ground lead @xmath35 . in the mentioned experiments",
    "@xcite , when the aim was to read the non - equilibrium dos , @xmath35 is very small compared to the other couplings ; in this case the currents l and r have always opposite signs , the same being true for the second derivatives ( 6 - 7 ) ; the conclusion is that both conductances are maximum in module at zero bias .",
    "however , for large coupling @xmath35 the above formulae indicate the possibility of a more complex behavior of the conductance .",
    "we identify first the case @xmath36 , as being the one commonly used , with the gate potentials symmetrically applied . in eq.6 , the straight parenthesis on",
    "the r.h.s is always positive for negative @xmath4 , so one may conclude that @xmath37 has the same sign as @xmath33 , which is negative , indicating a peak also in the differential conductance @xmath38 . for negative @xmath4 , it turns out from eqs.3,4 that @xmath39 and @xmath40 , meaning that the left and right currents flow in opposite directions",
    ". then the above argument holds for the module of @xmath41 which is also maximum at zero bias .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath42 and @xmath36 , @xmath43 is not zero as a consequence of the spectral asymmetry @xmath44 ( see eq.5 , and also notice the different heights of the side peaks in fig.1 ) . the same non - zero value of the current through the grounded lead was discussed in @xcite , for the sequential tunneling case , and attributed to the electron - hole asymmetry . under the above mentioned conditions",
    "@xmath45 indicating a saddle point . in this case , the conductance through the central lead does not show a peak shape , being instead antisymmetrical about @xmath14 .",
    "= 0.5    = 0.5    a different situation occurs in the case @xmath3 .",
    "it is obvious that , without loss of generality , we may consider actually @xmath46 meaning that , by convention , the smaller bias is applied on the left lead .",
    "one may now conclude from eq.6 that the peak / dip behavior in the left lead is completely determined by the sign of @xmath47 .",
    "this result may be of potential interest for experimentalists .",
    "in particular , if one finds the crossover value @xmath5{1+\\delta_c/\\delta_r}$ ] ( when the peak changes into dip ) , the ratio @xmath48 can be immediately extracted .",
    "the mentioned coupling ratio is otherwise inaccessible to direct measurement .",
    "such a peak - dip crossover can be seen in the fig.2a .",
    "the numerical plot ( see below calculation details ) indicates that the dip is considerably narrower than the kondo temperature , and is situated in the middle of a larger peak .",
    "this means that even if the conductance through the left lead initially increases , it will eventually start to decrease for a larger bias .",
    "it is an expected behavior , since for large biases all kondo correlations are killed and all the conductances approach the ( much lower ) non - kondo limit .",
    "the conductances through the right and central leads have the usual peak behavior ( see fig.2b , c ) .",
    "one has to pay attention to the fact that the conductance through the central lead is negative due to the sign convention regarding the currents direction , but it is maximum in module at @xmath7 bias , and should be considered as a kondo peak .",
    "we stress that the formulas eqs.6 - 8 are quite general , and also hold outside the kondo regime ( for high temperatures or weak couplings ) , but in this case they are not very insightful .",
    "the variation of the differential conductance is very smooth outside the kondo regime , and it is difficult to determine its convexity unambiguously .",
    "in order to illustrate the results , we shall calculate the differential conductance for the multi - lead anderson model : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the energy of the dot level , @xmath51 is the coulomb repulsion and , for instance , @xmath52 annihilates an electron with momentum @xmath53 and spin @xmath54 in the @xmath16 lead .",
    "the last term describes the coupling between the dot and leads .",
    "the quantity needed in the current formula eq.1 is the dot retarded green function @xmath55 , which will be calculated in the lacroix @xcite approach .",
    "we write the equation of motion for the green function and perform a decoupling approximation at the third step in order to close the system of equations . in our case , we consider three leads ( reservoirs ) instead of one as in @xcite , the generalization being straightforward .",
    "the resulting formula , in the @xmath56 limit , reads : @xmath57    since we work in a non - magnetic case , the subscript @xmath54 can be omitted in the green function notation .",
    "it comes now into question how to treat the averages of the type @xmath58 , for instance , where the two operators refer to electrons in different leads . for equilibrium , when all the fermi levels are equal , one can use the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which relates the average to the corresponding green function : @xmath59 in non - equilibrium , the fermi functions @xmath60 are different in the three leads @xmath61 , and for the calculation of the mentioned average we propose @xmath62 in the calculations there also appear averages of the type @xmath63 , so that a distribution function on the dot is also needed . for the dot we shall use the weighted mean @xmath64 .",
    "this intuitive expression of @xmath65 has been used in , e.g. @xcite , and we have checked that the present results , i.e. existence of the dip and its temperature dependance , are stable with respect to different ways to introduce the non - equilibrium .",
    "these non - equilibrium aspects being settled , we continue along the lacroix line , and with the definitions @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is the half - bandwidth and is taken as energy unit ) the following expression is obtained : @xmath70    in getting this expression we use the approximation @xmath71 , which was proposed first by lacroix for the kondo regime , and later used also in @xcite .",
    "eq.13 can be easily solved .",
    "first , one conjugates the equation , and after that @xmath72 is replaced in the initial formula to obtain a simple algebraic second degree equation for @xmath73 , only one of the solutions being physical .",
    "the solution is analytic , but is not included here because its lengthy .",
    "it is important to mention that this solution of the eom allows to address the low temperature regime ( @xmath74 ) , which is not possible with the more simple decoupling scheme in @xcite .",
    "= 0.5    fig.3 shows that the kondo - type temperature dependance of the conductance ( i.e. , decrease of with increasing temperature ) occurs in the range @xmath75 $ ] ( @xmath76 being calculated as in @xcite ) .",
    "this range is in fact dependent on @xmath4 and we checked that it becomes narrower when @xmath4 increases .",
    "= 0.5    one can also notice that the width of the dip increases with the temperature .",
    "actually the temperature dependance of the conductance comes from the spectral function @xmath77 .",
    "let us define the width of the dip @xmath78 as the distance between the two peaks . by scaling the width with temperature",
    "the data from fig.3 generates fig.4 which shows that , for not too large values of the parameter @xmath4 , the width behaves like :    @xmath79    for @xmath4 close to @xmath80 the error in the calculation of the dip width becomes large , and we suggest a numerical fit to obtain the dip - peak crossover point @xmath80 .",
    "the polynomial fit gives a value of @xmath80 very close to the exact result @xmath81 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the non - equilibrium transport through a quantum dot connected to three reservoirs . in kondo regime , if the potentials are applied asymmetrically on the leads ( i.e. @xmath82 ) a peak - dip crossover of the differential conductance occurs in left lead at zero bias .",
    "the proof is based on the connection between the convexity of the differential conductance and the convexity of the density of states at @xmath14 and is independent of the hamiltonian model .",
    "the ratios of the lead - dot couplings ( @xmath83 ) can be obtained if the crossover value @xmath84 is determined experimentally .",
