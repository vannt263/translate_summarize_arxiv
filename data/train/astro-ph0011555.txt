    "in 1992 nasa s cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite made a full sky map of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature with 7@xmath0 resolution , uncorrelated pixel noise , minimal systematic errors , and accurate calibration , from which cmb temperature anisotropy was first discovered @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the map mission is to re - map the anisotropy over the full sky with more than 30 times the angular resolution ( @xmath1 fwhm ) and more than 35 times the sensitivity ( @xmath2 @xmath3k per 0.3@xmath4 pixel ) of cobe , but with the same level of quality control as was possible with cobe . with this data",
    ", map will measure the physical interactions of the photon - baryon fluid ( sound waves ) in the early universe and thereby test models of structure formation , the geometry of the universe , and inflation .    in the years since cobe",
    ", a host of ground - based and balloon - borne experiments have detected and characterized fluctuations at smaller angular scales , most recently the experiments toco @xcite , boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite .",
    "however , because of their proximity to the earth and its atmosphere , none of the ground or balloon - based experiments enjoy the extent of systematic error rejection or calibration accuracy that was possible with cobe .",
    "moreover , many of these experiments have significantly correlated noise that places severe demands on the data analysis .",
    "the cobe data still serves as a benchmark for the field and many aspects of the cobe mission have influenced the design of the map mission .",
    "the need to minimize the level of systematic errors has been the major driver of the map design and has led to the following high level design features :    * * a highly symmetric differential design * : map is a differential experiment based on pseudo - correlation microwave radiometers that employ phase - matched hemt amplifiers .",
    "the instrument measures temperature differences between two points @xmath5 141@xmath4 apart on the sky .",
    "by measuring temperature differences , rather than absolute temperatures , many spurious signals will be common - mode and thus cancel upon differencing .",
    "also , by employing a pseudo - correlation design with a fast chopping frequency between the two sky inputs , 1/f noise that arises from the hemts can be chopped out .",
    "the resulting power spectrum of the radiometer noise is very nearly white ( see  3 ) . * * multi - frequency * : there are five frequency bands from 22 - 90 ghz that will allow emission from the galaxy and other non - cosmological sources to be modeled and removed based on their frequency dependence . in the lowest frequency bands",
    ", map will probe the high frequency tail of radio emission from our galaxy and provide valuable data on the enigmatic microwave foreground emission that correlates with thermal dust emission , but has a much different spectrum .",
    "see @xcite for a recent summary of evidence for this foreground . *",
    "* stability * : map will observe from a lissajous orbit about the l2 lagrange point 1.5 million km from earth .",
    "the l2 point offers an exceptionally stable environment and an unobstructed view of deep space , with the sun , earth , and moon always in shadow behind map s sun shield .",
    "map s large distance from earth protects it from near - earth emission and other disturbances .",
    "while observing at l2 , map s sun shield and solar panels maintain a fixed angle with respect to the sun to provide exceptional thermal and power stability . *",
    "* low beam sidelobe levels * : the map optical system was designed with the foremost goal of providing adequate angular resolution along the line of sight while at the same time rejecting stray light from other directions .",
    "for example , the largest instantaneous signal due to radiation from the galactic plane spilling into a sidelobe is expected to be less than 2 @xmath3k at 90 ghz .",
    "an overview of the map satellite is shown in fig .  [ map_view ] .",
    "the major visible features of map include the back - to - back telescope optics with 1.4 @xmath6 1.6 m primary mirrors and 1 m secondary mirrors , the passive thermal radiators which cool the hemt amplifiers to @xmath7100 k , the hexagonal structure housing the spacecraft service modules , and the large solar panel array / sun shield which keeps the instrument in full shade .",
    "map weighs a total of 830 kg and stands @xmath54 m tall .",
    "it will be launched in 2001 aboard a delta 7425 - 10 expendable launch vehicle from the nasa kennedy space center eastern test range .",
    "the map scan strategy plays an important role in systematic error rejection .",
    "it was designed with the following goals in mind :    * scan a large fraction of the sky as rapidly as possible , consistent with reasonable requirements on the controlling hardware and the telemetry data rate . *",
    "scan each sky pixel through as many azimuthal angles as possible for the reasons listed below . *",
    "observe a given pixel on as many different time scales as possible . * maintain the instrument in continuous shadow for optimal passive cooling and avoidance of stray signals from the sun , earth , and moon .",
    "* maintain a constant angle between the sun and the plane of the solar panels for thermal and power stability .",
    "the strategy that was ultimately adopted combines a `` fast '' spin about the spacecraft symmetry axis with a slow precession about the sun - map line ( which is always within 0.1@xmath4 of the sun - earth line at l2 ) .",
    "since each telescope line of sight is @xmath8 off the symmetry axis , the path swept out on the sky by a given line of sight resembles a spirograph pattern that reaches from the north to south ecliptic poles .",
    "as map orbits the sun , this pattern revolves around the sky so that full sky coverage is first achieved after 6 months of observing at l2",
    ".    2 minute spin period ( darker single circle ) .",
    "the inner circle depicts the path of the spin axis during one precession . ]",
    "the map scan strategy achieves a reasonable level of azimuthal coverage in each sky pixel .",
    "for example , a pixel in the ecliptic equator is observed over @xmath530% of the possible angles of attack ; a pixel at the cusp of the annular coverage at @xmath9 ecliptic latitude is observed over about 70% of possible angles of attack ; and a pixel near the ecliptic poles is observed from 100% of the possible azimuthal orientations .",
    "a large azimuthal coverage provides numerous desirable features in the data :    * helps to produce a stable sky map solution .",
    "* produces small pixel - pixel covariance at the beam separation scale . *",
    "minimizes striping due to any residual 1/f noise in the differential data .",
    "* maximizes polarization sensitivity .",
    "* maximizes azimuthal symmetry of the beam response on the sky .    from this standpoint , the map strategy is not as complete as cobe s , which achieved nearly 100% azimuthal coverage in all pixels .",
    "however , in order to achieve such completeness , the spacecraft spin axis must ultimately point to every pixel on the sky which is less desirable from the standpoint of systematic error avoidance .",
    "the map strategy achieves reasonable azimuthal coverage consistent with strong systematic error constraints .",
    "extensive simulations of the map making and power spectrum estimation procedures have shown that the strategy is more than adequate to meet map s scientific goals .",
    "sky maps , @xmath10 , are obtained from the differential data , @xmath11 , by linear least squares fitting .",
    "the raw data takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scan matrix of the experiment which has @xmath14 columns and @xmath15 rows , where @xmath14 is the number of sky map pixels and @xmath15 is the total number of differential observations .",
    "each row ( observation ) of length @xmath14 contains a @xmath16 in the element ( pixel ) observed by the @xmath17 horn during that observation , and a @xmath18 in the element observed by the @xmath19 horn .",
    "the normal equations for the sky map solution are @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the covariance of the instrument noise in the time domain . for map s differential radiometers this",
    "is well approximated by stationary , white noise , @xmath22 .",
    "a sample of the map noise covariance is shown in fig .",
    "[ noise ] from test data taken with the flight instrument .",
    "the whiteness of the noise greatly simplifies the subsequent data processing and analysis for two reasons 1 ) the normal equations for the sky map are much easier to solve than they would be with significant 1/f noise , 2 ) the pixel - pixel noise covariance in the final sky maps is very small and completely negligible for most applications .     in the text ) of 8 hours of noise from one of the map 90 ghz radiometers , taken during a cold instrument test in march 2000 .",
    "the instrument was operating at expected flight temperature while observing temperature controlled targets over the flight feeds .",
    "the only processing applied to the raw data was to subtract a baseline with power on periods of greater than  1 hour ( a legendre polynomial of order 8 fit over the 8 hour period of data ) .",
    "this approximates the procedure that will be applied to the flight data .",
    "note the point at lag 1 ( inset ) has a covariance of 1.2% of the raw noise due to a low - pass filter applied just prior to the a / d conversion .",
    "there is no other significant covariance in the noise . ]    with stationary white noise , the maximum likelihood sky map solution reduces to @xmath23 while the pixel - pixel noise covariance is @xmath24 formally , the sky map solution ( [ map_soln ] ) requires inverting an @xmath25 matrix @xmath26 which has the form @xmath27 where the @xmath28th diagonal element is the number of times pixel @xmath28 was observed by either side of the instrument , and the @xmath29th off - diagonal element is the number of times pixels @xmath28 and @xmath30 were observed simultaneously . because of the fixed separation between the two instrument beams , only pairs of pixels separated by a fixed distance can be simultaneously observed , thus this matrix is very sparse .",
    "furthermore , because the scan strategy generates ample azimuthal coverage , we have @xmath31 so @xmath32 is diagonally dominant .",
    "[ formally @xmath32 is singular because the sum of each of its rows or columns is zero , due to the fact that the time - series data is differential .",
    "thus the sky map solution and its pixel - pixel covariance are undetermined up to a constant since @xmath33 for any constant vector or matrix @xmath34 . in practice",
    "this mode is readily projected out of the data in any actual inversion scheme . ]",
    "the form of @xmath32 suggests an iterative approach to solving for the map that employs a diagonal pre - conditioner as an approximate inverse @xcite .",
    "define @xmath35 and assume an approximate initial map solution @xmath36 such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "this gives an expression for @xmath39 in terms of known quantities @xmath40 we can use the above pre - conditioner to obtain an iterative estimate of the map correction @xmath41 , and hence an improved solution @xmath42 @xmath43 as was noted in @xcite , an efficient way to evaluate the right hand side of ( [ map_it ] ) is to group the operations as follows @xmath44 the interpretation of ( [ map_wright ] ) is that for each pixel the new sky map temperature is equal the average of all differential observations of that pixel , accounting for the sign of the observing horn , corrected by an estimate of the signal in the pair horn , based on the previous sky map iteration . the expression in ( [ map_wright ] )",
    "can be efficiently evaluated because the sums can be accumulated by reading through the time - series data , read from disk , and accumulating data into arrays of length @xmath14 .",
    "it is never necessary to store or invert and @xmath25 matrix .    .",
    "note the small ( @xmath71% ) nearest - neighbor covariance due to the nearest - neighbor covariance in the time - series data .",
    "there is also a small ( @xmath50.1% ) covariance between pixels separated by the beam spacing , indicated by the dashed line in the inset panel . ]",
    "the performance of this algorithm has been tested extensively with simulations that capture differential data with realistic instrument noise observed with the map scan strategy .",
    "the solution is seen to converge to the input in less than 50 iterations , starting from an initial guess with no anisotropy . in cases",
    "where the instrument noise has been suppressed for study purposes , peak - peak features in the residual sky map ( output @xmath19 input ) are less than 0.1 @xmath3k . in cases where realistic noise is included , the performance of the algorithm can be measured by the 2-point angular correlation function of the residual ( noise ) map . ideally , this would be everywhere consistent with zero except for the bin at zero angular separation which should equal the variance of the map .",
    "[ map_2pt ] shows the 2-point function obtained from a noise map that was obtained from the map algorithm . to a very good approximation ,",
    "the noise in the sky map is uncorrelated from pixel to pixel .",
    "the most fundamental statistic to measure from the observed sky map is its angular power spectrum , @xmath45 , which measures the variance of the fluctuations over a range of angular scales .",
    "if the temperature fluctuations are gaussian , and the _ a priori _ probability of a given set of cosmological parameters is uniform , then the power spectrum may be estimated by maximizing the multi - variate gaussian likelihood function @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a data vector ( see below ) and @xmath34 is the covariance matrix of the data which has contributions from both the signal and the instrument noise , @xmath48 .",
    "we can work in whatever basis is most convenient , in the pixel basis the data are the sky map pixel temperatures while in the spherical harmonic basis the data are the @xmath49 coefficients of the map . in the former basis",
    "the noise covariance is nearly diagonal , while in the latter , the signal covariance is @xmath50 { \\bf m } & \\rightarrow & t_i & & { \\bf m } & \\rightarrow & a_{\\ell m } \\\\[2 mm ] { \\bf s } & \\rightarrow & \\sum_{\\ell } \\frac{(2\\ell + 1)}{4\\pi}c_{\\ell}p_{\\ell}(\\cos\\theta_{ij } )   & & { \\bf s } & \\rightarrow & { \\rm diag}(c_2,c_2,\\ldots c_3,c_3,\\ldots ) \\\\[2 mm ] { \\bf n } & \\rightarrow & \\sigma_i^2 \\delta_{ij } & & { \\bf n } & \\rightarrow &   n_{(\\ell m)(\\ell m)^{\\prime } } \\mbox{(see below)}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    in the case of map , the length of the data vector , @xmath51 , is of order 1 million , so it is necessary to find methods for evaluating @xmath52 that do not require a full inversion of the covariance matrix @xmath34 , which requires @xmath53 operations . as with the map - making ,",
    "our approach is fundamentally an iterative one that exploits the ability to find an approximate inverse @xmath54 .",
    "the most important feature in the data that makes this possible is the fact that we cover the full sky and that the galaxy cut we impose on the data is predominantly azimuthally symmetric in galactic coordinates . of secondary importance for this pre - conditioner",
    "is that fact that our noise per pixel is not too strongly varying across the sky .",
    "we discuss the pre - conditioner in more detail below .",
    "we maximize the likelihood by solving @xmath55   & & { \\bf p}^{\\ell } \\equiv \\frac{\\partial { \\bf c}}{\\partial c_{\\ell } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] using a newton - raphson approach to root finding that generates an iterative estimate of the angular power spectrum at each step @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fisher matrix @xmath58 in order to implement the solution in ( [ nr_cl ] ) we need to be able to evaluate the following components of @xmath59 quickly @xmath60 we use the spherical harmonic basis in which the data vector consists of the @xmath49 coefficients of the map obtained by least squares fitting on the cut sky .",
    "the signal covariance is diagonal in this basis , while the noise matrix is obtained from the normal equations for the @xmath49 fit @xmath61 where @xmath62 the sums are over the uncut pixels in the sky map , and we have used the fact that the noise is uncorrelated from pixel to pixel .",
    "the term @xmath63 appears repeatedly in the evaluation of ( [ nr_cl ] ) .",
    "we compute this by solving @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "a more numerically tractable system is obtained by multiplying both sides by @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the spherical harmonic transform of the map , defined in ( [ ny_def ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath68 can be quickly computed in any pixelization scheme , such as healpix , that has the property of having pixel centers that lie on rings of constant latitude with fixed longitude spacing so that fast fft methods may be used in the transform @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we then solve ( [ czm ] ) using an iterative conjugate gradient method with a pre - conditioner for the matrix @xmath69 .",
    "we find the following block - diagonal form of @xmath13 to be a good starting point @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an approximate block - diagonal form of the noise matrix discussed below .",
    "the lower - right block of @xmath72 occupies the high @xmath73 portion of the matrix where the signal to noise ratio @xmath74 is low , so a diagonal approximation is adequate .",
    "the upper - left block occupies the low @xmath73 portion of the matrix where the signal dominates the noise , so we need a better estimate of @xmath75 . in practice",
    "we find this split works well at @xmath76 for the estimated map noise levels . as for the approximate form of @xmath75 , defined in ( [ ny_def ] ) , note that the dominant off - diagonal contributions arise from the azimuthally symmetric galaxy cut , which couples different @xmath73 modes , but not @xmath77 modes .",
    "thus @xmath75 is approximately block diagonal , with perturbations induced by the non - uniform sky coverage of map .",
    "we therefore use a block diagonal form of @xmath75 as the pre - conditioner @xmath78 using the pre - conditioner ( [ pre_con ] ) we find that the conjugate gradient solution of ( [ czm ] ) converges in approximately six iterations and requires only minutes of processing as a single processor job on an sgi origins 2000 .",
    "[ [ evaluation - of - mboxtrbf - c-1cdotbf - pell - and - f_ellellprime ] ] evaluation of @xmath79 and @xmath57 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    there are two approaches to evaluating @xmath79 .",
    "the first is to employ the approximate form @xmath80 using the preconditioner ( [ pre_con ] ) .",
    "the second is to note that since @xmath81 , it follows that @xmath82 .",
    "thus we can use monte carlo maps with the requisite signal and noise contributions to evaluate @xmath79 .",
    "this is the most computationally intensive part of the power spectrum estimation , requiring @xmath83 operations , where @xmath84 is the number of monte carlo realizations used , and @xmath85 is the number of iterations used in the conjugate gradient solution of ( [ czm ] ) . in practice",
    ", we find it most efficient to use the approximate form for the first few iterations of ( [ nr_cl ] ) then switch to the monte carlo form for the final few .    the same considerations can be applied to the evaluation of the fisher matrix , however it is important to note that the newton - raphson method does not require an accurate 2nd derivative in order to converge to the correct solution .",
