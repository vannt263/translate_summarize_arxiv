    "today we are excited by the fast advance of the physics and applied mathematics in the area of research of complex systems in nature and society [ 1 - 8 ] .",
    "an important part of the ground for this success was created more than 60 years ago when l. f. richardson and l. w. lanchester , both famous british scientists , were the first who rose and applied the idea for mathematical modeling of arms races and military combats [ 9 - 12 ] . for many years",
    "the research on wars and other military conflicts was concentrated in the military universities and academies . in the last 20 years and especially after the terrorist attack on 11th of september 2001 this research became actual for many physicists and applied mathematicians too [ 13 - 15 ] .    in this paper",
    "we shall follow the terminology used by epstein @xcite who applied ecological models of lotka - volterra kind for description of combats .",
    "let us have two conflicting groups named the `` red group '' @xmath0 and the `` blue group '' @xmath1 .",
    "a general form of model equations of an armed conflict between these groups is @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the numbers of armed members of the two groups ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the `` firing efectivenes '' ( technology level ) of the groups ; and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are linear or nonlinear functions , depending on the character of the conflict .",
    "epstein @xcite proposed the following class of models of the conflict @xmath9 where @xmath10 are real nonnegative coefficients .",
    "if these coefficients are constants the models are called hard models .",
    "if the coefficients depend on the the number of participants or on the parameters of the environment the models are called soft ones .",
    "important characteristics of the model ( [ epst1 ] ) is the casuality exchange ratio or state equation ( the ratio of eliminated members of the `` red '' and `` blue '' groups ) . for ( [ epst1 ] )",
    "the ratio is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the integral form of the above casuality exchange ratio is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the numbers of the members of the two groups at the beginning of the conflict ( at @xmath17 ) .    for developing of intuition and decision skills it is of interest to know @xmath3 and @xmath4 in closed form .",
    "such analytical solutions are possible only in small number of cases .",
    "section 2 contains the solution of the system of model equations for selected values of the parameters @xmath18 .",
    "several concluding remarks are summarized in section 3 .",
    "the linear model of lanchester describes position conflicts such as the battles for somna and verdune in 1916 .",
    "the coefficients in ( [ epst1 ] ) are @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the equation of state is quadratic @xmath21 where @xmath22 can be positive , negative , or @xmath23 . for the case",
    "@xmath24 we obtain @xmath25 and the solutions are @xmath26 evidently @xmath27 which means that after endless position conflict the two groups are destroyed and no one of them wins .",
    "however the situation changes if @xmath28 .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath29 . from the state equation ( [ steq1 ] ) @xmath30 and",
    "the solutions of the model system of equations are @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the obtained solutions satisfy the initial conditions @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "in addition at @xmath35 we obtain @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in other words",
    "the blue group will win the conflict if it lasts long enough .",
    "the red group commanders have to change the strategy if they want to escape the defeat .",
    "if this does not happen after the time @xmath38 from the beginning the red group will be completely destroyed - fig",
    ". 1 .    ) .",
    "the conflict ends at finite time by destruction of the red group .",
    "nevertheless the blue group suffers heavy losses.,width=529 ]    we note again that this happens when @xmath29 , i.e. , when @xmath39 the condition ( [ sqlaw ] ) ( but with @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 ) for military combats is known as the square law of lanchester : to stalemate and adversay army two times as numerous as yours , your army must be four times as effective .",
    "but in this case our army will be also destroyed .",
    "thus the correct statement of the square law is as follows : to stalemate and adversay army two times as numerous as yours , your army must be four times as effective .",
    "in other words : in position war , in order to stop army that is @xmath42 time larger than yours your army has to be more than @xmath43 technologically better ( to have more than @xmath43 times larger firepower ) .",
    "we now discuss the case @xmath44 .",
    "the solutions of the model equations are @xmath45 now the red group wins if @xmath46 i.e. when @xmath47 , @xmath48 .      in this case",
    "the coefficients in the general model are @xmath49 and the equation of state is @xmath50 epstein assumes that stalemate occurs when @xmath51 , i.e. , when @xmath52 .",
    "let us discuss this in more details .",
    "if @xmath53 ( epstein case ) then the solution of the model system of equations is @xmath54 thus at @xmath55 , none of the groups wins , the attack is stopped but the two groups are completely destroyed . this of course is not of favor for the group leaders . in order to consider more realistic scenarios we have to set @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the solutions of the model equations are @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . now",
    "the sign of @xmath60 determines the asymptotic behavior of the number of members of the two groups . if @xmath61 then @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus the blue groups wins and the results of the attack is that the red group is defeated -fig.2    ) . , width=529 ]    now let @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath65 in this case as winner from the attack scenario is the red group as @xmath66 , @xmath67 .    now let us discuss the following detail .",
    "let us assume that at the beginning of the attack the blue group has more soldiers than the red group : @xmath68 but the firepower of the red group is larger : @xmath69 .",
    "then there must be a moment @xmath70 where the two groups will have equal number of armed members : @xmath71 .",
    "this moment @xmath70 can be determined from the equation of state ( [ steq2 ] ) @xmath72 what is interesting that when @xmath73 a solution exists only if @xmath74 and it is ( see fig.3 )    ) , width=529 ]    @xmath75      for this case @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath78 what is interesting here is that the large group does not win in any case .",
    "let for an example @xmath79 .",
    "then the solutions of the model equations are @xmath80 which means that none wins ( @xmath81 ) and the groups are destroyed .",
    "this of course is not acceptable for both sides .",
    "more realistic are situations where @xmath82 .",
    "let first @xmath83 .",
    "the solution of the model equations is @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus in the asymptotic case @xmath87 and @xmath63 , i.e. the blue groups wins .",
    "quite interesting is the case @xmath88 . in this case",
    "the solution of the model system is @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 . in this case at @xmath92",
    "we obtain @xmath93 .",
    "thus at @xmath94 this conflict ends .",
    "blue group is completely destroyed and the red group wins .      for these models @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "epstein @xcite argues that the exponents @xmath18 in the general model ( [ epst1 ] ) should be kept in the interval @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "however there is no evidence to sustain such an assertion .",
    "here we investigate two models for which some of the exponents @xmath18 equal @xmath99 .",
    "let first @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the model equations are @xmath102 the equation of state is @xmath103 if @xmath24 then the equation of the state together with one of the model equations yield @xmath104 no one of the groups wins at @xmath105 . if @xmath106 we obtain @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "thus @xmath63 and @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath110 @xmath111 thus @xmath112 and @xmath66 .",

    "assuming @xmath68 but @xmath69 and letting @xmath121 we obtain @xmath122 \\hskip.5 cm \\kappa = \\frac{r+b}{r - b}\\ ] ] thus @xmath123 at @xmath124 . nevertheless , both groups , fight to the end ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "it is known from the history of the conflicts that epidemic events had frequently occurred particularly in case of attrition and ambush conflicts .",
    "the simplest way to account for this effect ( removing of conflict participants because of sickness ) is to modify the general model as follows @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are coefficients of morbility ( sick rate ) removal .",
    "generally @xmath129 .",
    "we choose to demonstrate the effect of epidemics on the model ( [ steq3 ] ) in the form @xmath130 hence @xmath131 where @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 in the general case ( [ dop4 ] ) the quantity @xmath135 can be zero , positive or negative .",
    "for an example if @xmath136 the solution of the model system is @xmath137 where @xmath138 these solutions degenerate into ( [ solution31 ] ) at @xmath139 .",
    "a class of mathematical models of armed conflicts ( [ epst1 ] ) was investigated .",
    "the purpose was to identify particular cases with exact simple solutions in analytical form @xmath140 and @xmath141 , where @xmath1 and @xmath0 were the armies numbers .",
    "it was found that these requirements were met by the linear ( lanchester s ) model known from long ago in the form ( [ steq1 ] ) as well as by several nonlinear models described in this paper .",
    "these models demonstrate rich behavior in the time .      *",
    "no one of the two groups @xmath1 and @xmath0 wins after endless ( @xmath105 ) attrition conflict- fighting to the finish ( [ res1 ] ) , ( [ sol6y ] ) * one of the groups wins after limited in time or after an endless conflict ( see table 1 ) + -2.5 cm + .summary of model predictions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     both conflicting groups are defined by their initial numbers @xmath15 , @xmath16 and respective firing efectivenesses per shot . the character of the conflict is modeled by the form of the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( [ model1 ] ) which can be linear or nonlinear .",
    "all models can be extended to account for occuring of epidemic events in the fighting groups .",
