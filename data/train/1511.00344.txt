    "the dynamical importance of small - scale gravity waves ( gws ) has been well recognized in the terrestrial middle atmosphere ( see the extensive review paper of * ? ? ? * ) and upper atmosphere ( e.g. , see the recent review of * ? ? ? * ) . on mars ,",
    "gws are generated by flow over much rougher than on earth topography , by strong convection , and volatile instabilities of weather systems .",
    "amplitudes of martian gws are , generally , larger than those in the lower atmosphere of earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the thermosphere @xcite .",
    "upward propagating and ultimately dissipating gws deposit a substantial amount of momentum and produce heating and cooling in the martian middle atmosphere ( 50100 km ) and thermosphere ( above 100 km ) @xcite . using the mars global surveyor ( mgs ) radio occultation data , @xcite have demonstrated that spectral amplitudes of small - scale gws below @xmath140 km drop off with respect to their vertical wavenumbers according to the theoretical saturation and power law dependence of @xmath2 slope , which implies a transfer of wave energy and momentum to the mean flow .",
    "based on the mgs accelerometer data , @xcite have found significant body forcing by gws in the lower thermosphere .    the martian atmosphere is approximately 100 times less dense than the terrestrial one .",
    "accordingly , molecular viscosity is to the same degree larger on mars , and damping by molecular diffusion and thermal conduction must be taken into account when gw propagation is considered , as in earth s thermosphere .",
    "gws of interest have horizontal wavelengths usually smaller than the conventional resolution of general circulation models ( gcms ) , and , thus , their effects have to be parameterized .",
    "@xcite applied the nonlinear spectral parameterization of small - scale gws of @xcite to the output of the mars climate database @xcite and demonstrated that dynamical effects of these waves in the martian lower thermosphere are very large and , therefore , can not be ignored .",
    "this parameterization was specifically developed for  whole atmosphere \" gcms , and was extensively utilized in numerous gw studies in the context of earth s middle atmosphere and thermosphere @xcite . with the parameterization interactively implemented into the max planck institute martian gcm ( mgcm ) @xcite ,",
    "@xcite have shown that gws play a very important role in the dynamics of the middle and upper atmosphere of mars .",
    "they close , and even reverse , the zonal jets , enhance the meridional circulation and middle atmosphere polar warmings , facilitate a formation of co@xmath3 ice clouds @xcite , and modulate the upper atmospheric response to dust storms @xcite .",
    "gw - induced cooling is as strong in the mesosphere and thermosphere as the major radiative cooling mechanism  the radiative transfer in the ir bands of co@xmath3 molecules @xcite ,  and can explain the observed temperatures in the lower thermosphere @xcite .",
    "gw parameterizations assume a spectrum of wave harmonics at a certain source level in the lower atmosphere in order to represent gw generation and activity .",
    "accurate estimates of gw momentum fluxes have , therefore , been recognized as an essential task in the earth climate studies . however , with the concerted efforts and numerous observational campaigns @xcite , the global picture of gws is still beyond our reach even on earth . on mars ,",
    "this goal is even farther away .",
    "the progress with numerical modeling has allowed to circumvent this problem to a certain degree by utilizing high - resolution ( gw - resolving ) gcms .",
    "they are now being increasingly used in earth studies for the interpretation and validation of observations and constraining parameterizations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that comprehensive gcms can capture a significant portion of gw sources and the details of wave propagation .",
    "thus , they provide a realistic surrogate for observations .",
    "the first high - resolution gcm for mars has been reported by @xcite , however , gws have not been considered explicitly at that time .",
    "the only other high - resolution mgcm has been presented by @xcite .",
    "they performed simulations with a horizontal resolution of @xmath4 degrees , and analyzed spatio - temporal spectra of the resolved fields .",
    "the major finding of their work was an enhancement of wave energy for harmonics with zonal wavenumbers @xmath5 up to 30 at tidal frequencies at heights where diurnal and semidiurnal tides are large .",
    "our paper further addresses the lack of knowledge of gw fields in the martian atmosphere with the new high - resolution ( @xmath11.1 degrees in horizontal ) mgcm , and directly focuses on smaller - scale ( @xmath6 ) harmonics , which usually have to be parameterized .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the high - resolution mgcm is described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "gw variations in the lower atmosphere ( 1030 km ) are presented and compared with observations in section  [ sec : loweratm ] .",
    "vertical propagation of gws is discussed in section  [ sec : vert ] , while horizontal distributions of their characteristics are given in section  [ sec : horiz ] .",
    "the high - resolution mgcm used in this study is based on the atmospheric component of the miroc ( model for interdisciplinary research on climate ) terrestrial gcm developed collaboratively by the atmosphere and ocean research institute ( aori ) , the university of tokyo , the national institute of environmental studies ( nies ) , and the japan agency for marine - earth science and technology ( jamstec ) in japan @xcite .",
    "it utilizes a spectral solver for the three - dimensional primitive equations , and has a set of physical parameterizations appropriate for the martian atmosphere as described in the works by @xcite .",
    "the mgcm accounts , among others , for radiative effects of gaseous carbon dioxide and airborne dust , and interactively simulates condensation and sublimation of the atmospheric co@xmath3 , formation of co@xmath7 ice clouds , snowfalls and seasonal ice cap in the polar atmosphere .",
    "the lower - resolution version of the mgcm has been validated against the observed zonal mean climatology @xcite , and extensively been used for studies of baroclinic planetary waves @xcite , zonal - mean variability in the middle- and high - latitudes @xcite , equatorial semiannual oscillations @xcite , winter polar warmings during global dust storms @xcite , and co@xmath3 snowfalls in the northern winter polar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "recently , this model received the name dramatic ( dynamics , radiation , material transport and their mutual interactions ) mgcm , and has been used to validate the retrieved temperature in the southern polar night from the mgs radio occultation measurements @xcite .    in this study",
    ", the mgcm was run at the t106 spectral truncation , which corresponds approximately to a 1.1@xmath8 @xmath9 1.1@xmath8 ( or @xmath160 km ) horizontal resolution . in the vertical direction",
    ", the model domain extends from the surface to @xmath180100 km , and is represented by 49 @xmath10-levels .",
    "such setup allows for realistically capturing generation and propagation of gws with horizontal wavelengths of @xmath11180 km and longer and , to some extent , their vertical attenuation due to nonlinear processes .",
    "these waves are subgrid - scale in conventional gcms , and the dynamical and thermal importance in the martian atmosphere of the harmonics of these scales has been demonstrated in the works of @xcite and @xcite , correspondingly .    the local thermodynamic equilibrium was assumed for the radiative effects of co@xmath3 gas at all heights .",
    "the results shown here are for the northern hemisphere winter solstice , i.  e. , when mars is at perihelion , and the dynamical processes in the atmosphere are most active .",
    "all the figures are based on 20-sol averaged fields centered at the solar longitude @xmath12 , with the dust opacity of @xmath11.0 in the visible wavelength ( a  low dust \" condition ) .",
    "we designate the shortest horizontal - scale fluctuations with the total wavenumber @xmath13 ( horizontal wavelengths less than @xmath1350 km ) as wave disturbances @xmath14 .",
    "this choice allows for explicitly considering harmonics , which are known to significantly contribute to dynamical and thermal forcing of large - scale atmospheric flows , and which are usually parameterized in gcms .",
    "correspondingly , the larger - scale ( @xmath15 ) fields here represent the  mean \" @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "similar definition is applicable to disturbance covariances .",
    "for instance , @xmath18 is the product of shorter - scale fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 on the globe , of which only the lower-@xmath21 portion is taken . effectively , averaging denoted by overbars is a horizontal spatial averaging , or a coarse - graining .",
    "direct measures of activity of fluctuating fields , which we believe are composed mainly of gravity waves , are their kinetic and potential energy ( per unit mass ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 , correspondingly : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the wind fluctuations in the zonal and meridional directions , respectively , @xmath27 is the acceleration of gravity , and @xmath28 is the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 averaged between 10 and 30 km are shown in figures  [ fig:1]a and [ fig:1]b .",
    "this representation allows for a direct comparison with the measurements of gw temperature fluctuations derived from mgs occultation data for the same season ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 4b ) .",
    "their observations show a gradual increase of @xmath23 in the southern hemisphere from @xmath292 j  kg@xmath0 at high - latitudes to 1015 j  kg@xmath0 and larger over the equator , which is in an excellent agreement with our simulations in figure  [ fig:1]b .",
    "measurements are missing for latitudes higher than 20@xmath30n , where simulations predict an increase of gw activity , and reaches its maximum ( of greater than 30 j  kg@xmath0 ) over the core of the westerly polar night jet ( at @xmath160@xmath30 ) .",
    "another observational constraint have been presented by @xcite , who derived temperature fluctuations from the mars climate sounder ( mcs ) data . although they were obtained for spatial scales longer than in our simulations",
    ", the magnitudes of variations are in a very good agreement between 100 and 10 pa ( several k ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2a ) .",
    "observations also show an enhancement of temperature fluctuations in the northern high - latitudes . in the southern hemisphere",
    ", our simulations do not reproduce large temperature fluctuations .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that the equatorial region has larger @xmath23 than any other latitude region , whereas our simulations display that this peak is shifted to the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere .",
    "the distribution of @xmath22 in figure  [ fig:1]a is similar to that of @xmath23 .",
    "it also demonstrates the latitudinal asymmetry of gravity wave activity in the lower atmosphere with the maximum in the winter hemisphere .",
    "there is an equipartition of kinetic energy between the zonal and meridional components of small - scale wind variations .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig:1]a indicate that the magnitudes of wind fluctuations increase from @xmath11 m  s@xmath0 in high latitudes of the southern hemisphere to @xmath16 m  s@xmath0 in the middle- and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere .",
    "these distributions of @xmath23 and @xmath22 clearly reflect gw sources in the lower atmosphere .",
    "one property of the small horizontal - scale wave field can immediately be found by comparing @xmath22 and @xmath23 : the kinetic component of energy exceeds that of potential energy .",
    "* equation ( 10 ) ) have derived the relation between the @xmath31 ratio and the intrinsic frequency of gravity wave @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the coriolis frequency .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : ratio ] ) that smaller-@xmath32 ( longer - period in the frame of reference moving with the local wind ) gw harmonics have larger @xmath31 ratios , while the latter asymptotically approaches unity for high - frequency harmonics .",
    "the calculated ratio @xmath31 plotted in figure  [ fig:1 ] points out the interhemispheric asymmetry in the distribution of the dominant intrinsic frequencies @xmath32 of resolved small - scale waves : they are a factor of two or more smaller in the winter hemisphere . given that their horizontal scales are approximately equal throughout the globe , this implies smaller intrinsic horizontal phase velocities @xmath35 of gws in the northern hemisphere .",
    "these waves are generated by the meandering strong winter polar jet ( large @xmath36 ) , which means that their observed horizontal phase velocities @xmath37 ( measured with respect to the surface ) are , on the contrary , large .",
    "a closer consideration of small - scale gw - induced fields , for instance , of the horizontal wind divergence @xmath38 ( see movie s1 in the supporting information ) , confirms that wave packets move eastward much faster in the winter polar jet region , although somewhat lag the mean zonal winds .",
    "this illustrates the bias in the horizontal phase velocities of small - scale gws in the source region first pointed out in the work by @xcite and utilized in the prescribed source spectrum in the gw parameterization studies for earth @xcite and mars @xcite . in the mountainous regions ,",
    "@xmath31 is , on the contrary , small ( blue shades in figure  [ fig:1]c ) , which indicates large intrinsic / small observed horizontal phase velocities .",
    "this means that topographically - induced gws dominate there , and that the wave packets are  tied up \" to the relief features .",
    "movie s1 clearly demonstrates this phenomenon .",
    "having considered gws in the lower atmosphere , we now turn to their upward propagation .",
    "vertical fluxes of the zonal and meridional momentum , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , are important quantities for examining this .",
    "zonally averaged distributions of the calculated @xmath39 and @xmath40 are plotted with color shades in figures  [ fig:2]a and b , respectively , and the mean zonal and meridional winds are superimposed with contour lines .",
    "the fluxes are vector quantities , which are conserved if no sources and sinks are present . for a given gw harmonic ,",
    "the momentum flux is proportional to the intrinsic phase velocities in the corresponding direction , and characterizes wave propagation with respect to the mean flow . only in the absence of the latter ,",
    "the signs indicate the direction of wave propagation with respect to the surface , that is , in the east - west or north - south .",
    "these results suggest that , in the lower atmosphere , the fluxes are , generally , directed against the local winds .",
    "this means that the spectra of gws are dominated by harmonics with observed phase velocities @xmath37 that are slower than the local wind (  lagging \" the flow ) , or having opposite signs ( moving against the flow ) : @xmath41 if @xmath42 , and @xmath43 if @xmath44 . over the course of vertical propagation , harmonics are selectively dissipated and/or obliterated due to breaking or filtering by the mean wind .",
    "the net wave momentum flux is determined by a delicate balance of contributions of  surviving \" harmonics from the initial spectrum .",
    "thus , magnitudes and even the sign of the net flux can vary with height . for instance , the apparent increase of the magnitude in low latitudes between 100 and 10 pa in figure  [ fig:2]a does not necessarily indicate in situ generation of waves with positive @xmath39 . harmonics with @xmath45 in the incident spectrum are filtered by the easterly wind @xmath44 , while waves carrying positive fluxes progressively contribute more , because a ) their amplitudes grow with height , and b ) @xmath35 and the associated momentum flux increase .",
    "above @xmath110 pa , the opposite occurs .",
    "harmonics with positive flux partly dissipate and deposit their momentum to the mean flow , as we shall discuss below , and partly their contribution decreases ( due to the mean zonal wind @xmath36 weakening ) along with the increase of the contribution of waves with negative fluxes .",
    "same can be applied to the local maximum of positive meridional fluxes @xmath46 over @xmath160@xmath30n in figure  [ fig:2]b .    since wave momentum fluxes are vector quantities they are not fully suitable for characterizing the net field , because harmonics with opposite signs may offset and even cancel contributions of each other .",
    "wave variances provide another proxy for wave activity , which is devoid of this limitation .",
    "figures  [ fig:2]c and d show their zonal mean latitude - altitude distributions in the form of kinetic and potential energy , @xmath22 and @xmath23 from ( [ eq : energy ] ) , multiplied by the mean density .",
    "@xmath47 exceeds @xmath48 everywhere in the atmosphere , as it does at lower altitudes in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the maximum of wave energy is in the lower atmosphere , where these waves are mainly excited , and decreases with height in each vertical column .",
    "however , a clear asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres is seen .",
    "wave activity is stronger , and gws penetrate higher in the winter hemisphere .",
    "partially , this may be explained by the asymmetry of sources in the lower atmosphere , but refractive properties of the atmosphere associated with the mean winds are likely to play a role as well .",
    "spectra of generated waves in average , are dominated by harmonics with slower phase velocities , as otherwise would cause an",
    " ultraviolet catastrophe \" ( integral of energy over spectrum diverges ) .",
    "these waves are less affected by strong winds in the core of the westerly jet , and , therefore , are being focused into it .",
    "one more reason for the asymmetry can be related to the oblique propagation : wave packets composed of harmonics with slower phase velocities can cover significant horizontal distances upon their vertical propagation .",
    "we can not diagnose the degree of obliqueness directly from the gcm output , and a ray tracing model is required for that .",
    "most likely , all three factors contribute to the obtained distributions of gw activity in the middle atmosphere . here",
    "we simply state that the simulated asymmetry awaits a validation with observations , and that any successful parameterization of subgrid - scale gws must reproduce it .",
    "figures  [ fig:2]a and b show that momentum fluxes ultimately decrease with height .",
    "divergence of the momentum fluxes quantifies the rate of wave obliteration , and the amount of momentum transferred to the mean ( larger - scale in our study ) flow .",
    "depending on the sign , waves can produce acceleration or deceleration of the latter .",
    "figures  [ fig:3]a and b present thus calculated forcing along the corresponding axes : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the components of velocity fluctuations , and @xmath51 . as can be seen , @xmath52 and @xmath53 created by the resolved small - scale motions are significant in the middle atmosphere ( tens of m  s@xmath0  sol@xmath0 ) , and directed mainly against the mean wind .",
    "this result is consistent with the estimates of gw drag obtained using the extended spectral parameterization of @xcite applied to the distributions of wind and temperature from the mars climate database @xcite , and interactively coupled with the martian gcm @xcite .",
    "one may notice that it is significantly smaller than the estimates of @xcite ( @xmath11000 of m s@xmath0 sol@xmath0 ) , but it is because we present zonal and time averaged quantities , while their results are based on individual measurements .",
    "instantaneously , @xmath52 and @xmath53 in our simulations can reach over 10 000 m  s@xmath0  sol@xmath0 .",
    "the response of the mean zonal winds to this forcing is also seen  the jets show the tendency to decrease and close in the upper portion of the domain .",
    "this can not be achieved in simulations with conventional ( low ) resolution without parameterized subgrid - scale gws , unless an artificial sponge layer is applied near the top .",
    "thus , our gw - resolving simulations represent a direct confirmation of the predictions on the dynamical importance and effects of small - scale gws in the martian atmosphere .",
    "the plotted divergences further illustrate gw propagation in the equatorial region .",
    "they show weak negative @xmath52 below 10 pa created by the absorption of harmonics with negative fluxes by the easterly mean wind @xmath44 , as is discussed above .",
    "around 10 pa , strong dissipation of harmonics with @xmath54 produces positive @xmath52 decelerating the mean wind . above 10 pa , the remaining harmonics with negative fluxes deposit the negative momentum upon their dissipation , which results in the acceleration of the negative flow .",
    "the latter seems paradoxial as all the waves with negative fluxes should have apparently been filtered below by the negative background wind .",
    "an in depth explanation of such phenomenon was given in the paper of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8 , paragraph 42 and figure 8) , and is related to the fact that the projection of the wind on the direction of wave propagation ( that affects the latter ) can significantly differ from the zonal wind alone .    the vertically alternating patches of positive and negative @xmath52 in the equatorial region tend to enhance the semiannual oscillation of the zonal wind , as discussed in the work of @xcite .",
    "the meridional component of the gw - induced torque , @xmath53 , also plays an important role in the middle atmosphere .",
    "it decelerates the cross - equatorial south - to - north meridional transport in low and middle latitudes at @xmath110 pa induced mainly by thermal tides , accelerates it somewhat higher ( at @xmath11 pa ) , and extends to high latitudes of the winter ( northern ) hemisphere .",
    "this leads to the intensification of the downward branch of the meridional transport cell over the north pole , which results in the increase of the adiabatic heating and enhancement of the middle atmosphere polar warming @xcite .",
    "similarly , small - scale gws decelerate the northward meridional flow in the upper mesosphere , and weaken the the meridional pole - to - pole cell .",
    "next , we estimate the contributions of the vertical component of the momentum flux divergence to the net @xmath52 and @xmath53 by plotting @xmath55 and @xmath56 in figures  [ fig:3]c and d. they are very close to those in figures  [ fig:3]a and b. this indicates that a ) horizontal propagation of gws plays a secondary role in forcing the mean flow , and b ) gw parameterizations accounting for only vertical propagation can successfully capture the major part of subgrid - scale gw effects in gcms .",
    "many parameterizations use wave momentum fluxes at a certain level in the lower atmosphere for the specification of sources . therefore , we plotted the longitude - latitude distributions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 at @xmath59 pa in figures  [ fig:4]a  b .",
    "they are shown with color shades , and the corresponding large - scale winds @xmath36 and @xmath60 are superimposed with contours . although all quantities are 20-day averaged , fluxes are seen to be very patchy , which demonstrates that sources are extremely localized both in space and time .",
    "peak values of the fluxes with alternating signs occur in the mountainous regions .",
    "they are evidently associated with waves generated by flow over topography .",
    "nevertheless , a clear asymmetry can be seen : fluxes predominantly have signs opposite to the mean local wind . in the middle- to high - latitudes of the northern hemisphere ,",
    "the distribution of the zonal flux is significantly smoother .",
    "these gws are excited within the curvatures of the winter westerly jet , which , in large , are associated with kelvin waves moving eastward with time .",
    "the meridional fluxes are negative and directed against the mean meridional wind between the equator and 45@xmath30n , and have alternating direction in other regions , where the mean wind is weak .    for comparison ,",
    "the zonal momentum fluxes created by harmonics penetrating to the mesosphere ( @xmath61 pa ) are shown in figure  [ fig:4]c .",
    "their distribution is significantly more horizontally homogeneous .",
    "most orographic gws ( with small with respect to the surface phase speeds ) are filtered out by the wind in the course of their vertical propagation , and create only a marginal enhancement over the mountainous regions .",
    "this confirms the fact well - known from earth studies that gws with progressively faster horizontal phase speeds dominate at high altitudes @xcite .",
    "the region with negative ( but large ) horizontal wave momentum fluxes in the mesosphere is confined to northern high - latitudes , which reflects the favorable propagation conditions for the corresponding harmonics , and which is in line with our finding using the gw parameterization @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of fluxes in the mesosphere significantly exceed those in the lower atmosphere , which merely reflects the wave amplitude growth due to exponential density drop with height .",
    "finally , we show the calculated vertical divergence of momentum fluxes ( wave drag ) , @xmath62 , in the mesosphere ( figure  [ fig:4]d ) .",
    "it is consistent with the zonal mean cross - section in figure  [ fig:2]d , but shows a high degree of horizontal inhomogeneity .",
    "locally , @xmath52 exceeds 200 m  s@xmath0  sol@xmath0 at @xmath61 pa , but almost nowhere is less than several tens of m  s@xmath0  sol@xmath0 .",
    "obviously , such strong effects of small - scale waves can not be ignored in the dynamics of the martian mesosphere .",
    "note that the values and distributions of both wave fluxes and acceleration / deceleration obtained in this high - resolution simulation can and should be served for validation and tuning of gw parameterizations .",
    "we presented the first results of simulations with a new high - resolution martian general circulation model ( triangle spectral truncation t106 ) that resolves ( in a 3@xmath63 sense ) harmonics with horizontal scales down to @xmath1180 km . in this paper , we concentrated on the northern winter solstice ( around the solar longitude @xmath12 ) and gw harmonics shorter than 350 km .",
    "this consideration leaves aside shorter - scale ( few tens of km ) harmonics generated by convection , and which can be important in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the main inferences of this first study of its kind are listed below .",
    "1 .   magnitudes of temperature variances due to small - scale gws ( or available potential wave energy @xmath23 ) between 10 and 30 km are in a good agreement with those obtained by @xcite from mars global surveyor radio occultation data . in addition , simulations show a gradual and steep latitudinal increase of @xmath23 from south to north with the maximum in the winter hemisphere , where the observational data are missing .",
    "variances of wave - induced horizontal wind fluctuations exhibit a similar behavior , however , with a steeper growth  the ratio of the wave kinetic and potential energy , @xmath31 , increases from @xmath11.5 in the southern hemisphere to about 3 in the northern one .",
    "3 .   two major sources of gws can be identified in the lower atmosphere : the mountainous regions generating slow , or even non - moving with respect to the surface wave packets , and the meandering winter westerly jet exciting faster gw harmonics traveling mainly eastward .",
    "the majority of generated gws move slower than the background wind , and the associated vertical fluxes of horizontal wave momentum are directed against it .",
    "most of gws are produced in the lower atmosphere , and their fluxes and energy decay with height .",
    "6 .   upon vertical propagation and dissipation ,",
    "these waves deposit their momentum directed mainly against the local wind , and , thus , provide a wave drag on the mean flow .",
    "7 .   as a result of the drag ,",
    "the simulated jets in both hemispheres demonstrate a tendency to close in the upper atmosphere .",
    "this feature can not be reproduced by gcms with a conventional ( low ) resolution without applying an artificial sponge near the model top or an appropriate gw parameterization .",
    "8 .   in the lower atmosphere ,",
    "the distributions of wave momentum fluxes are very patchy , reflecting the highly localized nature of gw sources .",
    "orographically generated slow waves are filtered in lower layers in the course of their vertical propagation , and the upper mesosphere is dominated by harmonics with faster horizontal phase velocities .    given the lack of observations of gws in the atmosphere of mars , our high - resolution simulations provide the much needed framework for constraining gw parameterizations , and validating the results obtained with the latter .",

    "<S> global characteristics of the small - scale gravity wave ( gw ) field in the martian atmosphere obtained from a high - resolution general circulation model ( gcm ) are presented for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated gw - induced temperature variances are in a good agreement with available radio occultation data in the lower atmosphere between 10 and 30 km . </S>",
    "<S> the model reveals a latitudinal asymmetry with stronger wave generation in the winter hemisphere , and two distinctive sources of gws : mountainous regions and the meandering winter polar jet . </S>",
    "<S> orographic gws are filtered while propagating upward , and the mesosphere is primarily dominated by harmonics with faster horizontal phase velocities . </S>",
    "<S> wave fluxes are directed mainly against the local wind . </S>",
    "<S> gw dissipation in the upper mesosphere generates body forces of tens of m  s@xmath0  sol@xmath0 , which tend to close the simulated jets . </S>",
    "<S> the results represent a realistic surrogate for missing observations , which can be used for constraining gw parameterizations and validating gcm simulations . </S>"
