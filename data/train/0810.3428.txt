    "the top quark was discovered in 1995 at fermilab in pair production mode ( @xmath4 events ) through strong interactions[1 ] .",
    "several properties of the top quark such as the mass , charge , lifetime , production cross - section and rare decay through flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) have been explored in fermilab , but most of these studies are limited by low statistics . due to the high event rates at lhc ( one @xmath4 event per second at a luminosity of @xmath8 @xmath9s@xmath6 ) at atlas , these top quark properties can be studied extensively at atlas giving the possibility to discover physics beyond the standard model . due to the very short life time , the top quark decays before it has time to hadronise . but",
    "its spin properties are not washed out by hadronization , rather the top quark spin information propagates to its decay products .",
    "this unique feature allows direct top quark spin studies .",
    "the top quark spin can be reconstructed by measuring the angular distributions of its decay products in the top quark rest frame .",
    "measurements of @xmath10-boson polarization complement top quark spin studies which can disentangle the origin of new physics . in the standard model , flavour",
    "changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are strongly suppressed at the tree level due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism . at the one loop level , small fcnc contributions are expected due to the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "the existence of @xmath11 bound states ( mesons ) of all other quarks encourages us to look for @xmath4 bound states .",
    "new resonances and gauge bosons strongly coupled to the top quark are expected in several theoretical models which can decay into @xmath4 pairs , leading to deviations from standard model @xmath4 production cross - section and top quark kinematics[2 ] .",
    "these new particles can reveal themselves in the @xmath4 invariant mass distribution .",
    "we have used semileptonic ( @xmath12 with @xmath13 ) and dileptonic ( @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) decays of @xmath4 events for the top quark charge reconstruction .",
    "we have used only the semileptonic decay channel for @xmath16 anomalous coupling , @xmath4 spin and spin correlation and @xmath4 resonance . for the semileptonic topology , we require exactly one isolated electron ( muon ) with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , at least 4 jets with @xmath17 and @xmath20 , at least 2 jets tagged as @xmath21-jets and missing transverse energy above 20 . for the dileptonic topology",
    ", we require exactly two isolated electrons ( muons ) with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , at least 2 jets with @xmath17 and @xmath20 , at least 2 jets tagged as @xmath21-jets and missing transverse energy above 20 .",
    "since the final state topology for the rare top quark decays via fcnc are different from semileptonic and dileptonic topologies , we have used different selection criteria which will be described in section 2.3 .",
    "we have presented the measurement of the top quark charge based on the reconstruction of the charge of the top quark decay products .",
    "the @xmath10 boson charge can be directly measured easily using its leptonic decay modes . due to quark confinement inside hadrons",
    ", we can not measure the @xmath21 quark charge directly .",
    "we have used @xmath21-jet charge weighting ( weighted sum of all the tracks in the jet ) and semileptonic @xmath21-decay approaches to measure @xmath21 quark charge . by using the weighting technique , it is possible to distinguish between the @xmath21-jet charges associated with leptons of opposite charges with a @xmath22 significance with only @xmath23  fb@xmath6 of data ( @xmath5  fb@xmath6 for semileptonic @xmath21-decay approach ) which allows the standard model ( @xmath24 ) and exotic ( @xmath25 ) scenarios to be distinguished .",
    "reconstruction of the magnitude of the top quark charge seems to be possible with @xmath26  fb@xmath6 using the weighting technique , but it is necessary to check the performance of the method with real data . the reconstructed @xmath21 quark and top quark charge are shown in figure 1 with @xmath5  fb@xmath6 of simulated data .",
    "the resulting top quark charge is @xmath27 .      in the standard model ,",
    "the top quarks are produced unpolarised in @xmath4 events , but their spins are correlated[4 ] .",
    "the production asymmetry ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) can be obtained from the angular distribution of the top quark decay products .",
    "in addition to the @xmath4 spin correlation , we can measure the @xmath10 polarization .",
    "the @xmath10-boson can be produced with right(@xmath30 ) , left(@xmath31 ) or longitudinal polarizations(@xmath32 ) with @xmath33 .",
    "the expected measurement results , using 1  fb@xmath6 of simulated data , are shown in table 1 .",
    "it is also possible to parameterise new physics in the @xmath16 vertex using anomalous coupling parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
