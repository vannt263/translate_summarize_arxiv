    "modification of the hadron properties in baryon environment is one of the important topics of contemporary strong interaction physics .",
    "this phenomenon has been predicted within various theoretical approaches such as qcd sum rules  @xcite , chiral dynamics  @xcite , relativistic mean - field  @xcite and quark - meson coupling model  @xcite .",
    "a recent review can be found in the ref .",
    "a hadron can change its properties such as mass and width once it is embedded into a baryon matter .",
    "this change is connected to the many body interactions of a hadron with surrounding nucleons .",
    "whether a hadron is - in addition - also affected by qcd condensates and their in - medium change  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite is still a matter of debate .",
    "nevertheless , the great interest in study of in - medium hadron properties is caused by the expectation to find the evidences of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "investigation of the vector mesons is of special interest in this context .",
    "theoretically , the possibility of the decrease in the mass of light vector mesons in matter was first pointed in @xcite and later in  @xcite . according to  @xcite",
    "the masses of the vector mesons scale with quark condensate , i.e. drop with rising of baryonic density .",
    "this effect can be a precursor phenomenon of the transition of strongly interacting matter to the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "first experimental signal of this phenomenon was recently observed in  @xcite .",
    "nambu and jona - lasino proposed the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry as the fundamental mechanism for the creation of a mass of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "recently , the in - medium change of the @xmath0 mesons spectral function was proposed as a probe of higher order qcd four - quark condensate  @xcite .",
    "an evidence for a decrease of the @xmath2 meson mass in heavy - ion collisions was obtained by the ceres collaboration at cern  @xcite and later by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite . since heavy - ion interaction is very complicated process",
    "in which the temperature and baryon density varies dramatically with time due to the formation and expansion of the `` fireball '' , the interpretation of experimental data on nucleus - nucleus collisions is far from being simple .",
    "the above results have been found an explanation in terms of shifting a @xmath2 meson spectral function to a lower mass , as expected from the theory . however , even the calculations that just used the free radiation rates with their - often quite large - experimental uncertainties are compatible with the observation .",
    "therefore , it is useful to explore the reactions with elementary probes ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , p ) since sizeable - about 20% - medium effects were predicted already at the density of ordinary nuclei  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the investigations of the reactions on nuclei is related to the fact that they proceed in the nearly cold static nuclear matter and thus the colliding system is much better under control .",
    "indeed , the first signals for lowering of the @xmath5 meson mass at normal nuclear matter density were recently observed in the @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite reactions .",
    "however , the critical analysis @xcite shows that data of the experiment @xcite are compatible with normal @xmath0 mass and an enlarged width .",
    "in contrast to the conclusion  @xcite the preliminary results of the clas collaboration ( jlab ) on the photoproduction of @xmath2 and @xmath0 mesons  @xcite also evidence for no shift in the mass .",
    "now there are only first estimates of the @xmath0 meson width in matter  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "thus , the available now experimental information does not allow to draw the final conclusion about the change of the @xmath0 meson properties even in nuclear matter of normal density .",
    "it should be stressed that the indications for decreasing of the @xmath0 meson mass in both experiments  @xcite ,  @xcite have been found for the mesons with low momenta relative to the surrounding nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , next generation of experiments need to addresses the issue of momentum dependence of medium effects .",
    "we suggest to explore the momentum dependence of the in - medium mass and width of the @xmath0 meson using the ion and proton beams of the itep accelerator facility twac  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of in - medium meson modification addresses the fundamental problems of strong interaction physics and is one of the hot current topics nowadays .",
    "the experiments with photon , pion , proton and ion projectiles are planned in wide collision energy range from a few gev ( gsi , jlab , jinr , cosy , spring-8 , itep ) till tev ( rhic , lhc ) .",
    "the goal of the proposed experiment is the investigation of the vector @xmath0 meson properties at normal nuclear density @xmath8 in nucleus - proton ( proton - nucleus ) collisions and at higher density in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the experiment aims at the study of the mesons with low momentum relative to the baryonic environment where the in - medium mass modification is expected to be most strong as well as at the study of high momentum range which is sensitive to the in - medium @xmath0 meson width .",
    "all information about the intrinsic properties of a meson is encoded in its spectral function s(m ) which can be written in non - relativistic breit - wigner form . in free space : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for a meson width and pole mass , correspondingly .",
    "due to the interaction with surrounding nuclear medium the meson acquires a selfenergy @xmath12 which is related to the nuclear optical potential u as  @xcite : @xmath13 where e is the total meson energy .",
    "the meson spectral function in nuclear medium is read : @xmath14^{2}/[m-(m_{0}+ m^{*})]^{2 } + [ ( \\gamma_{0}/2)+(\\gamma^{*}/2)]^{2}.\\ ] ] two extra terms , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which describe the shift of the meson pole mass and the increase of its width in matter , are related to the nuclear optical potential @xmath17 as follows  @xcite : @xmath18 the pole mass and width of the @xmath0 meson in free space ( vacuum ) are m = 782 mev and 8.4 mev , correspondingly .",
    "most theoretical investigations predict the dropping of the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass by 20 - 140 mev  @xcite at normal nuclear density .",
    "however , there have also been suggestions for a rising mass  @xcite or even a structure with several peaks  @xcite . at the same time there seems to be a general agreement that in - medium @xmath0 width is within the range from 20 mev to 60 mev  @xcite at the density @xmath2 = @xmath19 .",
    "thus , it is expected that the @xmath0 meson in matter survives as a quasiparticle and can be observed as a structure in the @xmath0 mass spectrum . in principle , both dilepton and @xmath20 invariant mass spectra can be used for the study of modification effects .",
    "the advantage of the dilepton decay channel is related to the fact that leptons are almost undistorted by the final state interactions .",
    "however , the @xmath0 signal in the dilepton mode is rather weak ( @xmath21 ) and is always accompanied by a comparatively large background from @xmath22 decays .",
    "the @xmath23 decay has a branching ratio @xmath24 what is 3 orders of magnitude higher .",
    "furthermore , the competing @xmath25 channel has a branching ratio which is a factor @xmath26 smaller . by these reasons",
    "the @xmath23 decay mode can be considered as an exclusive probe to study the @xmath0 meson properties in matter .",
    "the disadvantage of this channel is a possible rescattering of the @xmath27 within the nuclear medium which would distort the deduced @xmath0 invariant mass distribution .",
    "however , as it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite the above distortion effect can be significantly decreased by applying an appropriate cut on the pion kinetic energy .",
    "the @xmath0 meson invariant mass spectrum has two components which correspond to the decay inside and outside the nucleus .",
    "only vector mesons decaying inside nuclei can be used for an identification of the in - medium @xmath0 mass .",
    "this imposes the kinematical condition that the decay length of the vector meson should be less than nucleus size .",
    "it implies that the @xmath0 meson should be produced with small momentum ( velocity ) relative to the nuclear matter rest frame .",
    "the study of low momentum @xmath0 mesons production in the inverse ap kinematics  @xcite has several important advantages over the study in the direct pa kinematics .",
    "first , as it follows from the lorentz transformation , slow particles in a projectile nucleus system appear to be fast in the laboratory ( in the target proton rest frame ) and become convenient for the detection . at beam energy of 4 agev",
    "all the @xmath0 s produced in full solid angle with momenta less than 0.3 gev / c relative to the projectile nucleus rest frame will be concentrated in the laboratory inside narrow cone of less than @xmath28 and the momentum range from 2.8 till 5.9 gev / c .",
    "the produced mesons which are almost at rest inside the incident nucleus ( `` comovers '' ) have the laboratory momenta around of 4 gev / c . due to the decrease of the production cross section with laboratory @xmath0 meson momentum the main contribution to",
    "the @xmath0 yield comes from the momentum interval of 2.8 - 4.0 gev / c .",
    "these events will be observed in small phase space @xmath29 in the laboratory resulting in significant increase in forward production cross section as compared to one in pa reactions .",
    "that can be easily understood because experimentally observed _ non - invariant double differential cross sections _ measured in the direct ( pa ) and inverse ( ap ) kinematics are related as : @xmath30 one can see that the factor @xmath31 grows strongly with lowering of the @xmath0 meson momentum while the factor @xmath32 changes rather smoothly .",
    "the photons from the decay @xmath33 are distributed inside more wide cone as compared to parent mesons , however the coverage of the angular interval @xmath34 - which corresponds to the solid angle of less than 9% of 4@xmath4 - permits to collect significant part of the useful events .",
    "second , the mean free pass of the proton in nuclear matter is as small as 2 fm and therefore the @xmath0 mesons are predominantly created inside the front layers of a projectile nucleus .",
    "since the forward produced @xmath0 s in the momentum range 2.8 - 4.0 gev / c have the laboratory velocities which are less than ones of the surrounding nucleons , the produced mesons move in the direction opposite to the ion beam direction and then decay in more dense inner layers of a nucleus . that is of great importance because the strength of the medium effects increases with nuclear density .",
    "third advantage of the inverse kinematics is an increase in the energies of the detected photons because they are emitted by relativistic @xmath0 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the @xmath20 decay in transverse direction of the @xmath0 carrying the momentum of 4 gev / c results in emission of the photon of energy 2 gev and @xmath27 of energy 2.1 gev followed by the pion decay to two photons of 1 gev energy .",
    "the above energies exceed the photon energies from the @xmath23 decay at rest ( 0.38 gev for the @xmath3 from @xmath0 and 0.19 gev for the @xmath3 s from @xmath27 ) by a factor of about 5 .",
    "that results in more precise measurement of the photon energy leading to more narrow width of the signal in the invariant mass spectrum and hence improved signal to background ratio . at last ,",
    "only moderate momentum resolution in the laboratory is required for the rather precise determination of the @xmath0 momentum relative to the projectile nucleus because the momentum range of interest 2.8 - 4 gev / c in the laboratory corresponds to the interval 0 - 0.3 gev / c in the nucleus frame of reference .",
    "in contrast with in - medium @xmath0 meson mass the value of its width is expected to be deduced from the analysis of the production of fast mesons relative to the baryonic matter .",
    "it is well known that high momentum mesons can be abundantly produced in the pa interactions .",
    "thus , the combination of the ap and pa measurements provides the possibility to study both @xmath0 meson mass and width in nuclear matter .",
    "we intend to carry out the proposed measurements using the ion and proton beams extracted in the inner hall of the accelerator .",
    "expected extraction efficiency is of 50% .",
    "two dipole and two pairs of quadrupole magnets serve for the deflection and focusing the beams onto the target .",
    "the sketch of the experimental set - up is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig omsetup ] . the ions ( or protons ) which do not interact in the target pass through the central hole of the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) and then directed to the downstream beam - dump located in the inner hall or thick concrete wall of the accelerator .",
    "that prevents the environment from the radiation pollution .",
    "the projectile ta , cu , al and c ions will be used for the investigations of the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass while the projectile protons will be used for the exploration of the @xmath0 width in the nuclear matter .",
    "the proton runs will permit us to study the emcal performance and calibrate the invariant mass scale by measurements of the reactions @xmath35+x , @xmath36+x and @xmath37+x .",
    "we plan to use the liquid hydrogen ( @xmath38 ) target of 2% interaction length ( 12 cm ) for ap measurements and simple foil targets ( be , al , cu , ag and ta ) for the pa and aa measurements .",
    "the ring - like electromagnetic calorimeter with total area of 0.64 @xmath39 will be located at the distance of 1 @xmath40 downstream of the target .",
    "we intend to use the emcal based on the pbwo cells @xmath41 size with avalanche photodiode or photomultiplier readout .",
    "the energy and spatial resolution of the cell are @xmath42/e=2%@xmath43 + 1% and @xmath44 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the total number of cells is 1400 . in front of a group of cells",
    "the 5 mm thick plastic scintillator with photodiode readout will be mounted for the detection of charged particles . due to the moderate charge ejectile multiplicity",
    "( see section  [ simulations ] ) the number of cpv ( charged particle veto ) counters is less than about 100 .",
    "this array can be also used as a multiplicity detector offering the possibility to apply the cuts on the impact parameter of the collision .",
    "for the evaluation of the expected signal of in - medium @xmath0 meson mass and width modification the calculations of the @xmath0 meson production were performed in the framework of the folding model .",
    "the model takes properly into account both incoherent direct proton - nucleon and secondary pion - nucleon @xmath0 meson production processes as well as internal nucleon momentum distribution ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the folding model describes the production , propagation and decay of the @xmath0 meson inside a nucleus taking into account its four - momentum and local nuclear density .",
    "the calculations were performed for ta , cu , al and c nuclei at initial energy of 4 agev .    in our approach",
    "the @xmath0 meson mass shift was introduced according to the local nuclear density @xmath45 :    @xmath46    where @xmath11 stands for the @xmath0 meson vacuum mass .",
    "the negative value of @xmath47 - in accordance with the theoretical predictions and the experimental observations  @xcite ,  @xcite - means that the @xmath0 meson feels a strong attraction inside nuclear matter which is of about 90 mev at nuclear saturation density @xmath19 . in our calculations",
    "the nuclear density distributions were taken in two - parameter fermi form .",
    "we primarily focus at study of the @xmath0 mesons with low momentum in the projectile nucleus rest frame by two reasons .",
    "first , the strength of the inside component of the @xmath0 decay - which carries the information on the in - medium meson mass - obviously increases with lowering of a meson momentum .",
    "second , the in - medium @xmath0 mass shift can depend on the meson velocity with respect to the surrounding nuclear matter ( see discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "the most strong effect is predicted to be manifest itself in the low momentum range .",
    "one can also expect that the low momentum @xmath0 mesons can be captured by the nucleus which leads to the formation of the @xmath0 - nucleus bound state  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the mass distributions of the @xmath0 mesons from cu+p collisions at 4 agev calculated within the frame of the folding model are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_om_inv_mass ] .",
    "meson mass spectra without and with the cuts on the meson momentum and collision impact parameter , width=453 ]    in the left panel we show the mass spectrum of all produced @xmath0 s .",
    "the right peak corresponds to the decays outside the nucleus and hence to the vacuum @xmath0  meson mass while the left part of the distribution corresponds to the decays inside the nucleus and contains the events with reduced meson masses 0.1 . ] . the relative amount of events where the @xmath0  mesons decay at finite nuclear matter density is vanishingly small .",
    "the fraction of the inside decays increases up to 1/3 for the @xmath0 mesons of momentum @xmath48 0.3 gev / c relative to the projectile nucleus frame of reference ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_om_inv_mass ] ) . the mass distribution for low momentum @xmath0 s produced in the central collisions with the impact parameter @xmath49 is shown in the right panel of fig .  [ fig_om_inv_mass ] .",
    "one can see further drop of the vacuum peak accompanied by the enlargement of the inside component up to almost 2/3 .",
    "the position of the vacuum peak can be used as a reference point on the invariant mass scale .    the density distribution with the above cuts on the @xmath0 momentum and the impact parameter is shown in fig .  [ fig_rho_om_dec_1 ] .",
    "it is seen that significant part of low momentum mesons produced in the central collisions decays in dense layers of the nucleus .",
    "note that the calculations within the folding model provide the possibility to estimate average nuclear density for the inside decay component .",
    "meson decay point for @xmath50 and @xmath49,width=453 ]    it should be mentioned that inelastic @xmath0-nucleus collisions , i.e. , the processes @xmath51 result in slowing down of the @xmath0 mesons and an enhancement of low momentum part of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , one can think that the range of low @xmath0 momenta would be even further enhanced due to decrease of the absorption effect .",
    "the value of @xmath52 in nuclear matter is expected to be less than one in the free space since pauli blocking prevents the low energy @xmath0-nucleon interactions .",
    "thus , we conclude that the prospective signal of the @xmath0 meson mass shift is strong enough to be observed experimentally .",
    "the proposed detector layout will permit us to collect a large amount of the @xmath0 mesons with low momenta relative to the surrounding nuclear matter ( see section  [ eventrate ] ) and study the momentum dependence of the predicted effect .",
    "the straightforward determination of the in - medium @xmath0 meson width from the shape of the observed mass spectrum is hardly possible because the rescattering of the pion would changes its kinematical parameters which results in distortion of the observed invariant mass peak .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have proposed the alternative method to study the @xmath53-meson width in the nuclear medium - by an attenuation measurements of the @xmath53 meson flux in photonuclear reactions on different nuclear targets .",
    "this method is based on the well known connection between the particle absorption in nucleus and the imaginary part of the respective nuclear optical potential ( see eq.[eq : param ] ) . the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite was applied by muehlich and mosel to the @xmath0 photo - production  @xcite .",
    "the flux of @xmath20 pairs which escape a nucleus had been calculated within the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenback ( buu ) coupled - channel transport approach . as a measure of the @xmath0 width in nuclei",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the so - called nuclear transparency ratio : @xmath54 i.e. the ratio of the inclusive @xmath0 photo - production cross section on nucleus divided by a times the same quantity on a free nucleon .",
    "it can be interpreted as the probability of the @xmath0 meson to get out of the nucleus .",
    "it was shown that the a - dependence of the production cross sections significantly differs from that expected in the case when there are no medium effects on the @xmath0 width .",
    "similarly , the valuable information about the @xmath0 width in the matter can be obtained from the analysis of a - dependence of @xmath0 meson production cross section in proton - induced reactions .",
    "although a proton initial state interaction is rather strong , the @xmath0 absorption is essential . for small angle @xmath0 production",
    "the last effect can be taken into account by the glauber eikonal factor which explicitly depends on the @xmath0 meson width @xmath55  @xcite :    @xmath56,\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 with @xmath58 the @xmath0 production point , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the momentum and velocity of the @xmath0 in the target nucleus frame , while @xmath61 stands for the local nuclear density .",
    "[ eq : survivalprobab ] shows that the survival probability p of the @xmath0 meson in its way out of a nucleus decreases with increasing of the @xmath0 width @xmath55 .",

    "- reflect the sensitivity of the a - dependence to the collision width @xmath55 .",
    "the difference between the curves is large enough to be detected in the experiment .",
    "since the shape of the a - dependence , and not so much the absolute value , is important to learn about the @xmath0 width , the cross section for middle and heavy nuclei can be normalized to the cross section for light nucleus .",
    "the a - dependence of the transparency normalized to the cross section for the @xmath0 production on carbon target is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_transp_ratio ] .        in spite of some less difference between the curves the measurement of the ratios has an advantage to cancel out most of systematic uncertainties .",

    "it is worth to note , that the possible effect of density dependent @xmath0 meson mass shift is of minor importance in high momentum range .",
    "for the simulations we use relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd )  @xcite event generator , version 4.12 .",

    "[ fig_pomegaanalcma ] ) .    assuming the cycle repetition of 10 @xmath80 and taking into account the detector efficiency of 15% ( after applying the cut on @xmath81 0.5 gev ) one can estimate the event rate for the above momentum ranges as :    n(@xmath82 0.3 gev / c ) = 0.33 x 225 x 0.15 x 10 = 111 events / min    n(@xmath82 0.5 gev / c ) = 0.33 x 796 x 0.15 x 10 = 398 events / min .",
    "as was described in the section  [ background ] one has to apply several cuts to reach the background conditions acceptable for the measurements .",
    "that leads to the reduction of useful events by a factor of 10 - 20 . in the most pessimistic case",
    "the numbers of useful events collected during one day measurement are :    n(@xmath82 0.3 gev / c ) = @xmath83 events / day    n(@xmath82 0.5 gev / c ) = @xmath84 events / day    the number of events in the lowest momentum interval @xmath82 0.1 gev / c is equal to approximately 350 per day . for the carbon projectile the event rates",
    "will be less by a factor of 4 - 5 due to the a - dependence of the production cross section .",
    "thus , the estimate clearly demonstrates that the investigation of the momentum dependence of the expected @xmath0 meson mass shift in the nuclear matter can be performed with high statistical accuracy .",
    "it should be noted that the above estimates are based on the rqmd simulations which disregard any medium effects on the @xmath0 .",
    "if the @xmath0 meson mass really drops in nuclear matter by 80 - 100 mev the production cross section would increase due to the downward shift of the reaction threshold .",
    "moreover , one can expect that the produced mesons will be decelerated during their way out of the nucleus due to the action of the attractive nuclear @xmath0 meson potential .",
    "this slowing down would lead to the increase in number of events in low momentum range .",
    "note also that the energy loss of a meson in the elastic and quasielastic @xmath65 scattering inside a nucleus results in the same effect .",
    "the usage of more intensive proton beam provides the possibility to collect large amount of data on high momentum @xmath0 meson production and perform the detail investigation of the momentum dependence of the @xmath0 meson width in the nuclear matter .",
    "data on the @xmath0 meson production in the momentum range around 1.5 gev / c can be obtained in both inverse and direct kinematics .",
    "these data will be used for the cross check and mutual normalization of the ap and pa measurements .",
    "the statistics which can be obtained in aa interactions is obviously higher than that in ap collisions .",
    "the modification of the properties of the vector mesons in baryon environment continue to be one of the most interesting topics in hadron physics today .",
    "we suggest to investigate the in - medium properties of the @xmath0 mesons at normal nuclear density in nucleus - proton and proton - nucleus collisions as well as at higher density in nucleus - nucleus collisions at itep accelerator facility twac .",
    "study of the ap and pa reactions is the effective tool to get the information on the in - medium @xmath0 meson properties at normal nuclear density .",
    "the using of the inverse ap kinematics and @xmath85 decay mode permits to collect large statistics for production of the @xmath0 mesons with low momenta relative to the nuclear matter . estimated high event rate offers the possibility to split the statistics into several momentum bins and study the @xmath0 meson mass shift in wide momentum interval _ including not yet explored range of momentum less than 0.3 gev / c which is expected to be most sensitive to the mass change effect_. the detail information on in - medium @xmath0 meson width in wide momentum interval will be obtained in pa collisions .",
    "the goal of the first stage of the experiment is to make decisive conclusion about the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass and width at normal nuclear density .    on the second stage of the suggested study",
    "we shall obtain the information on the @xmath0 meson production in nucleus - nucleus collisions which will be used for the investigation of the in - medium @xmath0 meson properties at higher density compared to that accessible in nucleus - proton interactions .",
    "the results obtained at the first stage of the investigation at normal nuclear density will provide the reliable basis for the selection and interpretation of specific nucleus - nucleus phenomena .",
    "ap , pa and aa measurements will be performed in quite identical conditions using the same experimental set - up .",
    "one of the possible extension of the proposed studies in a few gev energy range is the investigation of the in - medium change of unflavored mesons .",
    "the performed rqmd simulations of the ap collisions show the significant yield of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 mesons for which the modification effects had also been theoretically predicted  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 decays are as high as 39% and 21% , correspondingly .",
    "the properties of these mesons can be investigated at twac using the same experimental set - up .",
    "the in - medium properties of the charmed mesons and charmonium can be explored at significantly higher ion energy which will be accessible at the new fair facility ( gsi ) . in particular",
    ", the mass splitting of @xmath90 mesons at high baryonic density  @xcite will be investigated by cbm experiment in heavy - ion collisions . as a masses of charmonia",
    "are large , only little sensitivity to changes in the quark condensate is expected .",
    "consequently , the in - medium mass of the charmonium states would be affected primary by a modification of the gluon condensate .",
    "large attractive mass shifts are predicted for exited charmonium states  @xcite .",
    "using the inverse and direct kinematics provides the possibility to study the production and propagation of both low and high momentum heavy quark systems in baryonic matter .",
