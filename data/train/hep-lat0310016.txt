    "one source of uncertainty in lattice qcd comes from the discretization effects in numerical simulations . here",
    "we extend the fermilab formalism to higher dimensional operators to obtain a more improved action for heavy quarks , aiming to reduce this uncertainty to 12% .",
    "the method starts with symanzik  @xcite , who introduced a local effective lagrangian @xmath0 of a continuum field theory .",
    "the @xmath1 are higher - dimensional operators .",
    "the lattice action is adjusted so that the short - distance @xmath2 coefficients vanish , at least approximately .",
    "the fermilab formalism  @xcite takes wilson fermions  @xcite with the clover action  @xcite and introduces different couplings for space - like and time - like interactions . ref .",
    "@xcite considers operators up to dimension five .",
    "@xcite adds dimension - six operators to this action . in this paper",
    ", we give a more complete action which has dimension six and some dimension seven operators and determine the couplings by matching at tree level .",
    "in this section , we consider the quark bilinears .",

    "redundant directions are identified by field transformations .",
    "they are used to eliminate the higher - order time derivatives , which would give large errors for large masses .",
    "we do not repeat this analysis here .",
    "the corrections in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sym ] ) should be classified by a power - counting scheme . for light quark physics",
    "the only relevant ratio is @xmath3 . for heavy quark physics , however ,",
    "the power counting should follow hqet for heavy - light systems or nrqcd for quarkonium . in hqet , operators are assigned a power of @xmath4 ; in nrqcd , a power of relative velocity  @xmath5 . in these power - counting schemes ,",
    "some dimension - seven interactions are commensurate with dimension - six interactions .",
    "as seen in the list in table  [ table:1 ] , they scale as @xmath6 or  @xmath7 .",
    ".dimension six and seven bilinear interactions in @xmath8 with hqet and nrqcd power counting .

    ", our lattice action takes the form @xmath11 where conventional difference operators and clover fields are understood .",
    "we have included some terms that we expect to be redundant , to retain some flexibility to , say , speed up computer simulations .    for brevity we do not introduce terms , corresponding to the last six rows of table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 are redundant .",
    "matching of the last four rows in table  [ table:1 ] requires a calculation of compton scattering , which is is still in progress .",
    "we derive matching conditions for the improvement couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) by matching on - shell quantities for small momentum but any  @xmath14 .",
    "we do this by calculating the energy momentum relation and the scattering of a heavy quark off a background field .",
    "the energy momentum relation has been studied @xcite and summarized @xcite before .",
    "it gives us conditions on  @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and  @xmath18 .",
    "results for the chromoelectric terms @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , determined from the temporal component of the background field .",
    "scattering from the spatial component of the background field yields results for the chromomagnetic terms .",
    "our results yield the following matching conditions .",

    "also @xmath23 we do not set @xmath24 or @xmath25 but choose it below so that @xmath26 .",
    "for the chromoelectric interactions one finds @xmath27 @xmath28 for the chromomagnetic interactions one finds @xmath29 in summary , we may set @xmath30 , leaving only five non - zero couplings : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath31 and  @xmath32 .",
    "we now estimate the discretization effects .",
    "it is advantageous to use a heavy - quark description of cutoff effects  @xcite , because then contributions from , say , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are automatically combined .",
    "thus , we express the uncertainties as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are hqet / nrqcd short - distance coefficients for lattice gauge theory and continuum qcd  @xcite .",
    "the mismatched coefficients can be obtained from the results of the previous section .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath37 are estimated by using hqet ( nrqcd ) power counting for heavy - light systems ( quarkonia ) .",
    "since higher - order calculations are not yet available we multiply the tree - level mismatch with @xmath38 to estimate the @xmath39loop mismatch .",
    "this is a conservative estimate because the most pessimistic asymptotic behavior for the coefficients of the improvement operators is the same at higher orders as in the tree level formulas of previous section . to obtain the numbers shown in figure  [ fig : errors ] , we take @xmath40 .    fig .",

    "the vertical lines represent @xmath44  fm and @xmath45  fm , corresponding to the unquenched milc lattices  @xcite .",
    "the black ( gray ) curves represent the charmed ( bottom ) quark .",
    "note that , in most cases , bottom quarks have smaller discretization effects than charmed quarks .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] shows concretely that the fermilab formalism avoids errors of order  @xmath46 .",
    "we have presented a more improved action for heavy quarks with five new operators .",
    "our error analysis shows that , to reduce errors below 1% , one - loop matching is essential for the coupling  @xmath47 of the chromomagnetic clover term .",
    "tree - level matching for the coupling of the chromoelectric term , @xmath19 , is usually enough , but one - loop may be necessary for charmonium .",
