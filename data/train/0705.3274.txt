    "astrophysical plasmas , from the interplanetary gas inside the heliosphere to the galaxy intracluster medium ( icm ) , are magnetized and turbulent and contain nonthermal particles in addition to gas thermal particles .",
    "so , understanding complex interactions among these different components is critical to the study of many astrophysical problems . in collisionless shocks",
    "entropy is generated via collective electromagnetic viscosities , interactions of charged particles with turbulent fields @xcite .",
    "some suprathermal particles of the shock heated gas can leak upstream , their streaming motions against the background fluid exciting mhd alfvn waves upstream of the shock @xcite . then those particles can be further accelerated to very high energies through multiple shock crossings resulting from resonant scatterings with the self - excited alfvn waves in the flows converging across the shock @xcite .",
    "detailed nonlinear treatments of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) account for incoming thermal particles injected into the cr population ( @xcite ) as a consequence of incomplete thermalization by collisionless dissipation processes . those particles , while relatively few in number , can subsequently accumulate a major fraction of the shock kinetic energy as their individual energies increase @xcite .",
    "such predictions are supported by a variety of observations including direct measurements of particle spectra at interplanetary shocks , nonthermal @xmath6-ray , x - ray and radio emissions of supernova remnant shocks and also possibly the icm of some x - ray clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "cr acceleration may be universal to astrophysical shocks in diffuse , ionized media on all scales .    unlike an ideal gasdynamic shock",
    ", downstream states of a cr modified shock can not be determined in a straightforward way by simple jump conditions across the shock front .",
    "this is because the shock transition depends on the cr pressure distribution upstream of the dissipative subshock .",
    "the particle acceleration takes place on diffusion time and length scales ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is diffusion coefficient and @xmath1 is the shock speed ) , which are much larger than the shock dissipation scales . unless or until some boundary condition limits the maximum cr momentum , this structure will continue to evolve along with the cr distribution .",
    "thus the evolution of a cr shock with a finite age and size should properly be followed by time - dependent numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , complex interplay among crs , resonant waves , and the underlying gas flow ( i.e. , thermal leakage injection , self - excited waves , resonant scatterings of particles by waves , and non - linear feedback to the gas flow ) is model dependent and not yet understood completely .    in the time dependent kinetic equation approach to numerical study of cr acceleration at shocks , the diffusion - convection equation for the particle momentum distribution , @xmath10 , is solved , along with suitably modified gasdynamic equations ( @xcite ) . since accurate solutions to this equation",
    "require a computational grid spacing smaller than the particle diffusion length , @xmath11 , and since realistic diffusion coefficients have steep momentum dependence , a wide range of length scales must be resolved in order to follow the cr acceleration from the injection momentum ( typically @xmath12 ) to highly relativistic momenta ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this constitutes an extremely challenging numerical task , which can require rather extensive computational resources , especially if one allows temporal and spatial evolution of diffusion behavior . to overcome this numerical problem in a generally applicable way we have built the crash ( cosmic - ray acceleration shock ) code by implementing adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) techniques and subgrid shock tracking methods @xcite in order to enhance computational efficiency .",
    "the crash code also treats thermal leakage injection self - consistently by adopting a shock transparency function for suprathermal particles in the shock @xcite .",
    "we previously applied our crash code in a plane - parallel geometry to calculate the nonlinear evolution of cr modified shocks in the absence of significant local alfvn wave heating and advection @xcite .",
    "for those models the shock sonic mach number , @xmath14 , largely controlled the thermal leakage injection rate and the cr acceleration efficiency in evolving modified planar shocks , since @xmath14 determines the relative velocity jump across the shock and consequently the degree of shock modification by crs . in all but some of the highest mach number shocks the cr injection rate and the postshock cr pressure approached time - asymptotic values when a balance was achieved between acceleration / injection and diffusion / advection processes .",
    "this resulted in an approximate `` self - similar '' flow structure , in the sense that the shock structure broadened approximately linearly in time , so that the shock structure could be expressed in terms of the similarity coordinate @xmath15 .",
    "it is likely that all of the models would have reached such asymptotic dynamical structures eventually , but performance limits in the version of the code in use at that time prevented us from extending some of the simulations long enough to confirm that .",
    "the cr distribution evolved only to @xmath16 .",
    "based on the self - similar evolution reported in our previous work , we calculated the ratio of cr energy to inflowing kinetic energy , @xmath17 , ( see eq .",
    "[ 12 ] below ) as a measure of the cr acceleration efficiency in a time - asymptotic limit .",
    "the cr energy ratio , @xmath17 , increased with the shock mach number , but approached @xmath18 for large shock mach numbers , @xmath19 , and it was relatively independent of other upstream properties or variation in the injection parameter . in those shocks where we observed time asymptotic dynamical behaviors the postshock cr pressures were @xmath2030 - 60% of the ram pressure in the initial shock frame , this ratio increasing with mach number .",
    "for some of the highest mach number shocks in that study cr pressure continued to increase to the end of the simulation , so the final values could not be measured . finally ,",
    "the presence of a preexisting , upstream cr population was seen in those earlier simulations to be equivalent to having slightly more efficient thermal leakage injection for such strong shocks , while it could substantially increase the overall cr energy in moderate strength shocks with @xmath21 .    in the present paper",
    ", we revisit the problem of self - similar evolution of cr modified shocks with a substantially improved numerical scheme that enables us to follow the particle acceleration to energies much higher than we considered before .",
    "this allows us to measure asymptotic dynamical properties for all the newly simulated shocks and to demonstrate that the self - similar evolution of the cr partial pressure in terms of a momentum similarity variable leads to the constancy of the postshock cr pressure .",
    "we also include in the new work the effects of alfvn wave drift and dissipation in the shocks . the time asymptotic cr acceleration efficiency is once again controlled by the shock mach number but diminished as the ratio of alfvnic mach number to sonic mach number decreases .",
    "the asymptotic shock properties are largely independent of the magnitude of the spatial diffusion coefficient and also its subrelativistic momentum dependence .",
    "the basic equations and details of the numerical method are described in  2 .",
    "we present simulation results for a wide range of shock parameters in  3 , followed by a summary in  4 .",
    "the evolution of cr modified shocks depends on a coupling between the gasdynamics and the diffusive crs . that coupling takes place by way of resonant mhd waves , although it is customary to express the pondermotive wave force and dissipation in the plasma through the associated cr pressure distribution properties along with a characteristic wave propagation speed ( usually the alfvn speed ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , in our simulations we solve the standard gasdynamic equations with cr pressure terms added in the conservative , eulerian formulation for one dimensional plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the evolution of a modified entropy , @xmath22 , is followed everywhere except across the subshock , since for strongly shocked flows , numerical errors in computing the gas pressure from the total energy can lead to spurious entropy generation with standard methods , especially in the shock precursor @xcite .",

    "the remaining variables , except for @xmath30 and @xmath31 have standard meanings .",
    "the injection energy loss term , @xmath32 , accounts for the energy carried by the suprathermal particles injected into the cr component at the subshock and is subtracted from the postshock gas immediately behind the subshock .",
    "gas heating due to alfvn wave dissipation in the upstream region is represented by the term @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the alfvn speed .",
    "this commonly used dissipation expression derives from a quasi - linear model in which alfvn waves are amplified by streaming crs and dissipated locally as heat in the precursor region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cr population is evolved by solving the diffusion - convection equation in the form , @xmath35 ,   \\label{diffcon}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , with @xmath10 the pitch angle averaged cr distribution , and where @xmath37 , while @xmath38 is the spatial diffusion coefficient @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we always express the particle momentum , @xmath39 in units @xmath40 and consider only the proton cr component .",
    "the wave speed is set to be @xmath41 in the upstream region , while we use @xmath42 in the downstream region .",
    "this term reflects the fact that the scattering by alfvn waves tends to isotropize the cr distribution in the wave frame rather than the bulk - flow , gas frame @xcite .",
    "upstream , the waves are expected to be dominated by the streaming instability , so face upwind . behind the shock , various processes , including wave reflection , are expected to lead to a more nearly isotropic wave field ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) are simultaneously integrated by the crash code in plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the detailed numerical description can be found in kang 2002 @xcite .",
    "a key performance feature of the crash code is multiple levels of refined grids ( typically @xmath43 ) strategically laid around the subshock to resolve the diffusion length scale of the lowest energy particles near injection momenta .",
    "grid refinement spans a region around the subshock just large enough to include comfortably the diffusion scales of dynamically important high energy crs with enough levels to follow freshly injected low energy crs with sufficient resolution to produce converged evolutionary behaviors . to accomplish grid refinement",
    "effectively it is necessary to locate the subshock position exactly .",
    "thus , we track the subshock as a moving , discontinuous jump inside the initial , uniform and fixed grid @xcite .      we considered in this study two common choices for diffusion models .",
    "first is the bohm diffusion model , which represents scattering expected for a saturated wave spectrum and gives what is generally assumed to be the minimum diffusion coefficient as @xmath44 , when the particles scatter within a path of one gyration radius ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath46 the coefficient @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the magnetic field strength in units of microgauss .",
    "there has been much discussion recently about amplification of the large scale magnetic field within the shock precursor ( @xcite ) . since physical models of that evolution",
    "are still not well developed , we will assume for simplicity in the simulations presented here that the large scale field is constant through the shock structure .",
    "because of its steep momentum dependence in the nonrelativistic regime , the bohm diffusion model requires an extremely fine spatial grid resolution whenever nonrelativistic crs are present . on the other hand",
    "the form of @xmath9 for nonrelativistic momenta mostly impacts only early evolution of cr - modified shocks , when cr feedback is dominated by nonrelativistic particles and thermal leakage injection rates are adjusting rapidly to changes from initial conditions .",
    "so , to concentrate computational effort more efficiently , we adopted in some previous works @xcite a `` bohm - like '' diffusion coefficient that includes a weaker momentum dependence for the non - relativistic regime , @xmath49 according to those previous studies , the differences in results between the two models are minor except during early nonlinear shock evolution , as expected .",
    "thanks to the weaker momentum dependence of @xmath50 we can , for given computational resources , calculate numerically converged models with smaller @xmath51 resulting in the acceleration of crs to higher momenta .    in order to quench the well - known cr acoustic instability in the precursor of highly modified cr shocks ( @xcite )",
    ", we assume a density dependence for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 or @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the upstream gas density .",
    "this density dependence also models enhancement of the alfvn wave magnetic field amplitude due to flow compression .",
    "we note , also , for clarity that hereafter we use the subscripts 0 , 1 , and 2 to denote conditions far upstream of the shock , immediately upstream of the gas subshock and immediately downstream of the subshock , respectively .      in the crash code suprathermal particles",
    "are injected as crs self - consistently via `` thermal leakage '' through the lowest cr momentum boundary .",
    "the thermal leakage injection model emulates the filtering process by which suprathermal particles well into the tail of the postshock maxwellian distribution leak upstream across the subshock @xcite .",
    "this filtering is managed numerically by adopting a `` transparency function '' , @xmath56 , that expresses the probability of supra - thermal particles at a given velocity , @xmath57 , successfully swimming upstream across the subshock through the postshock mhd waves @xcite .",
    "the one model parameter , @xmath58 , is the ratio of the amplitude of the postshock wave field interacting with the low energy particles , @xmath59 , to the general magnetic field , @xmath60 , which is aligned with the shock normal in these simulations .",
    "the transparency function fixes the lowest momentum of the cr component in our simulations from the condition that @xmath61 ( non - zero probability to cross the subshock for crs ) for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the downstream flow speed in the subshock rest frame .",
    "initially @xmath65 is determined by the downstream speed of the initial shock , but it decreases as the subshock weakens and then it becomes constant after the cr modified shock structures reach asymptotic states .",
    "since suprathermal particles have to swim against the scattering waves advecting downstream , the subshock mach number , @xmath66 , is one of the key shock characteristics that control the injection fraction .",
    "previous simulations showed that injection is less efficient for weaker shocks , but becomes independent of @xmath14 for strong shocks , when the subshock compression asymptotes @xcite .",
    "for a given total shock mach number , @xmath14 , on the other hand , the injection rate is controlled mainly by the parameter @xmath67 in practice we have found that @xmath68 leads to an injection fraction in the range @xmath69 .",
    "this is similar to commonly adopted values in other models that employ a fixed injection rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "although somewhat higher field turbulence values ( @xmath70 are suggested theoretically for strong shocks @xcite , these evoke a start - up problem in the numerical simulations , since they lead to very rapid initial injection that cools the postshock flow too strongly for it to remain numerically stable .",
    "once the shock structure becomes nonlinear , however , those influences moderate greatly , so that , as we have shown previously , the ultimate cr acceleration behavior depends only weakly on @xmath67 . in fact , we have found previously for strong shocks that the time - asymptotic behaviors are very weakly dependent on @xmath67 @xcite , so its chosen value will have no influence on our final conclusions .",
    "we directly track the fraction of particles injected into the cr population as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the cr distribution function above @xmath65 , while @xmath73 is the number of particles passed through the shock until the time @xmath74 .",
    "the highest momentum of the cr component , @xmath75 , is chosen so that it is well above @xmath76 at the simulation termination time , where @xmath76 is defined in  2.4 .",
    "the postshock thermal energy in a gasdynamic shock can , of course , be calculated analytically by the rankine - hugoniot jump condition . on the other hand , the cr population and the associated acceleration efficiency at cr modified shocks",
    "should properly be obtained through time - dependent integration of the shock structure from given initial states , since the cr distribution depends on the shock structure , which is not discontinuous and continues to evolve so long as the cr population evolves . in particular cr",
    "modified shocks contain a smooth precursor in the upstream region whose scale height grows in time in proportion to the diffusion length of energetically dominant particles .",
    "the total shock compression may , similarly , evolve over a significant time period .",
    "the standard expression for the mean acceleration timescale for a particle to reach momentum @xmath39 in the test - particle limit of dsa theory is given by @xcite @xmath77 in the test particle limit the shock compression is given by the rankin - hugoniot condition . then assuming a @xmath78 gasdynamic shock and a diffusion coefficient taking the density dependence indicated at the end of  2.2 , this leads to @xmath79 where @xmath1 and @xmath14 are the shock speed and sonic mach number , respectively . while this expression should strictly speaking be modified in highly modified cr shocks , since the shock structure and the associated cr transport are more complex than assumed in eq .",
    "( [ tacc ] ) @xcite , we find it empirically to be reasonably consistent with our results described below .",
    "accordingly , we may expect and confirm below that the time - dependent evolution of our cr modified shocks will be determined primarily by the shock mach number and can be expressed simply in terms of diffusion length and time scales .    within this model the highest momentum expected to be accelerated in strong shocks by the time @xmath74",
    "is set according to eq .",
    "( [ tacc ] ) by the relation @xmath80 . in that case",
    "the scale height of the precursor or shock transition structure grows linearly with time as @xmath81 independent of the magnitude or the momentum dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "this evolution should continue until some other physics limits the increase in cr momentum , such as the finite size of the shock system . since the cr pressure approaches a time - asymptotic value ( see figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] below ) , the evolution of the cr - modified shock becomes , under these circumstances , approximately self - similar , independent of the form of the diffusion coefficient , while @xmath82 grows linearly with time @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath83 , so for bohm - like diffusion , @xmath84 .",
    "thus , at a given time the cr distribution , @xmath85 , extends for bohm - like diffusion according to @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a comparison of three models of a @xmath87 shock with @xmath88 using @xmath89 , and with @xmath90 using @xmath91 in units defined in the following section .",
    "the upper left panel , displaying the evolution of postshock cr pressure , demonstrates similar time - asymptotic values for all three models . at early times",
    "the cr pressure evolution depends on details of the model , including numerical properties such as spatial and momentum grid resolutions , and the previously described injection suppression scheme used to prevent start up problems .",
    "the other panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrate shock structure comparisons for the three models at the end of the simulations .",
    "the shock structures , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , are very similar , while the cr spectrum extends to different values of @xmath76 , inversely proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "the self - similar evolution of cr modified shocks makes it useful to apply the ratio of cr energy to a fiducial kinetic energy flux through the shock as a simple measure of acceleration efficiency ; namely , @xmath95 more specifically , this compares the total cr energy within the simulation box to the kinetic energy in the _ initial shock frame _ that has crossed the shock at a given time . as the shock structures approach time - asymptotic forms the above discussion suggests that @xmath96 also may approach time - asymptotic values .",
    "this is confirmed in our simulations .",
    "we see also that the asymptotic @xmath17 values depend in our simulations primarily on shock sonic mach number and are independent of @xmath97 .",
    "the highest momenta achieved in our simulations are set by practical limits on computation time controlled by the vast range of diffusion times and lengths to be modeled . still , the asymptotic acceleration efficiency ratio is almost independent of the maximum momentum reached . for the three models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for example , @xmath98 and @xmath99 at @xmath100 , depending on the value of @xmath51 , but the cr energy ratio approaches similar values of @xmath101 for all three models .",
    "the expected evolutionary behaviors described above naturally suggest convenient units . for example , given a suitable velocity scale , @xmath102 , and length scale , @xmath103 , a time scale @xmath104 and diffusion coefficient scale , @xmath105 are implied .",
    "alternatively , one can select the velocity scale along with a convenient scale for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath106 , leading to a natural length scale , @xmath107 and a related time scale , @xmath108 .",
    "we will follow the latter convention in our discussion .",
    "in addition , given an arbitrary mass unit , @xmath109 , which we take to be the proton mass , we can similarly normalize mass density in terms of @xmath110 .",
    "pressure is then expressed relative to @xmath111 . for clarity",
    "we henceforth indicate quantities normalized by the above scales using a tilde ; for example , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath94 .",
    "we start each simulation with a pure gasdynamic , right - facing shock at rest in the computational grid .",
    "we use the upstream gas speed in this frame , @xmath114 as our velocity scale , so that the initial , normalized shock speed is @xmath115 with respect to the upstream gas .",
    "the upstream gas is specified with one of two temperature values , either @xmath116k or @xmath117 , which represent warm or hot phase of astrophysical diffuse media , respectively . in astrophysical environments , for example ,",
    "photoionized gas of @xmath118 k is quite common .",
    "hot and ionized gas of @xmath119 k is also found in the hot phase of the ism @xcite .",
    "the shock speed and the upstream temperature are related through the sonic mach number , @xmath14 , by the usual relation @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the sound speed of the upstream gas .",
    "so , by choosing @xmath122 and @xmath14 , we set the physical value of the shock speed , which , in turn , determines the postshock thermal behavior . for cr distribution properties",
    "it is also necessary to define the speed of light , @xmath123 , in terms of @xmath124 .",
    "the normalized upstream gas density is set to unity ; @xmath125    the preshock pressure is determined by the shock mach number , @xmath126 , where the gas adiabatic index , @xmath127 .",
    "the postshock states for the initial shocks are determined by the rankine - hugoniot shock jump condition . for models with @xmath116k , @xmath12810 - 80",
    "is considered , since the gas would not be fully ionized at slower shocks ( @xmath129 ) , the postshock gas would often become radiative and the cr acceleration become inefficient owing to wave dissipation from ion - neutral collisions ( @xcite ) . for models with @xmath117k @xmath130 ( @xmath131 )",
    "is considered , since the cr acceleration should be relatively independent of @xmath122 for shocks with @xmath3 .    in order to explore effects of pre - existing crs ,",
    "we also consider , as we did in our earlier work , models with @xmath117 k that include an ambient ( upstream ) cr population , @xmath132 for @xmath133 and set its pressure @xmath134 .",
    "for these models , we adopt @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . for strong shocks",
    "the presence of pre - existing crs is similar in effect to having a slightly higher injection rate , so the time asymptotic shock structure and cr acceleration efficiency depend only weakly on such a pre - existing cr population @xcite . on the other hand , for weak shocks ,",
    "a pre - existing cr pressure comparable to the upstream gas pressure represents a significant fraction of the total energy entering the shock , so pre - existing crs obviously have far more impact .",
    "in addition , the time asymptotic cr acceleration efficiency in weak shocks depends sensitively on the injection rate , so increases with increased shock transparency , controlled through @xmath67 ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "hence , as we found in @xcite , we expect relatively weak cr shocks ( @xmath138 ) to be substantially altered by the presence of a finite upstream @xmath139 .      as shown in earlier works ( @xcite and references cited therein ) , the cr acceleration becomes less efficient when alfvn wave drift and heating terms are included in the simulations .",
    "this behavior comes from two effects previously mentioned in  2.1 , both of which derive from the resonance interaction between crs and alfvn waves in the shock precursor .",
    "the alfvn waves stimulated by cr streaming in the precursor will propagate in the upstream direction , so that the effective advection speed of the crs into the subshock is reduced .",
    "in addition , if the energy extracted from crs to amplify these waves is locally dissipated , the heating rate in the precursor is increased with respect to the adiabatic rate , so that gas entering the subshock is relatively hotter , and the subshock strength is accordingly reduced .",
    "the significance of the effects depends on the sonic mach number , @xmath14 , relative to the shock alfvnic mach number , @xmath140 ; on the ratio of the alfvn speed to the sound speed ( see  3.4 ) . in a parallel shock",
    "we can write @xmath141}$ ] , where we introduce a convenient `` alfvn parameter '' as follows , @xmath142 this expresses the relative upstream alfvn and sound speeds in terms of the magnetic to thermal energy density ratio .",
    "the parameter @xmath143 is the usual `` plasma @xmath144 '' parameter . for @xmath78 , @xmath145 . and @xmath146 .",
    "we emphasize for clarity that the present simulations are of parallel shocks , so that the direct dynamical role of the magnetic field has been neglected .",
    "observed or estimated values are typically @xmath147 for intracluster media and @xmath148 for the interstellar medium of our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "so we consider @xmath149 , and we will provide comparison to the weak field limit , @xmath150 .",
    "[ fig2 ] concisely illustrates the importance of alfvn wave drift and heating effects on a mach 10 shock .",
    "one can see that the postshock cr pressure , for example , decreases by more than a factor two when the sonic and alfvn mach numbers become comparable .",
    "most of the model results we show here used @xmath151 . for the mach 10 shocks illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the associated wave terms have reduced the asymptotic cr pressure by about 30% with @xmath151 compared to the shock with no such terms included .      according to our previous studies @xcite",

    "[ fig5 ] that the spatially integrated spectra in the stronger shocks show more obvious hardening at high momenta than do the spectra measured at the subshock .",

    "the normalized gas pressure simultaneously drops in response to increases in @xmath211 , as one would anticipate .",
    "it is notable that it actually falls well below 0.25 , where one might naively expect it to asymptote in order to maintain a constant total postshock pressure with respect to @xmath212 .",

    "we note that the subshock behavior seen here in highly modified strong shocks , particularly that it generally evolves towards mach numbers close to three , is consistent with previous analytic and numerical results , although in some other studies the subshock strength is completely independent of @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",

    "we mention that the precursor / subshock compression properties also explain the observed inverse dependence of postshock gas pressure on initial mach number .",

    "also the presence of preexisting crs facilitates thermal leakage injection , leading to more injected cr particles and higher acceleration efficiency .",
    "thus , an accurate estimate of the cr energy generated at quasi - parallel shock requires detail knowledge of complex physical processes involved .",
    "fortunately , all theses dependences become gradually weaker at higher mach numbers , and @xmath17 tends to approach 0.5 for @xmath3 .",
    "it seems likely that this asymptotic efficiency would also apply for sufficiently large @xmath236 . for low mach number shocks ,",
    "it is not yet possible to make simple , model - independent efficiency predictions .",
    "while full thermalization takes place instantaneously at a simple , discontinuous jump in an ideal gasdynamic shock , cr acceleration and the corresponding modifications to the underlying flow depend on suprathermal particles passing back and forth diffusively across the shock structure via resonant scatterings with mhd waves .",
    "so the time dependent evolution of cr modified shocks depend on complex interactions between the particles , waves in the magnetic field , and underlying plasma flow .",
    "these processes develop on the diffusion time scale and diffusion length scale , which are expected to be increasing functions of particle momentum , so cr acceleration and shock evolution rates slow over time . here",
    "we have carried out time - dependent dsa simulations to study the evolution of plane cr modified shocks with quasi - parallel magnetic fields .",
    "simple models for thermal leakage injection and alfvn wave propagation and dissipation are included . by adopting an underlying base grid that moves with the subshock ,",
    "our crash code with shock tracking and amr techniques can achieve good numerical convergence at a grid resolution much coarser than that required in a fixed , eulerian grid . in the comoving grid ,",
    "the shock remains at the same location , so the compression rate is applied consistently to the cr distribution at the subshock , resulting in much more accurate low energy cr acceleration .",
    "we showed that the time dependent evolution of cr modified shocks becomes approximately self - similar , because the postshock variables including the cr pressure approach time - asymptotic values while the shock structure broadens linearly with time as @xmath245 and the maximum cr momentum increases approximately as @xmath246 .",
    "this behavior develops because the thermal leakage injection rate is controlled mainly by the shock mach number and because the ratio @xmath247 is a function of shock mach number .",
    "the self - similar behavior is independent of the assumed diffusion coefficient .",
    "when the drift and dissipation of alfvn waves in the upstream region are included , the cr acceleration is less efficient for a given mach number , as expected from previous studies @xcite .",
    "however , at sufficiently high mach numbers it appears , even with the inclusion of the alfvn wave terms , that the efficiency probably asymptotes to approximately 50% as measured by both the fraction of energy flux transferred to crs and the fraction of momentum flux that appears as postshock cr pressure .",
    "we summarize here the main properties of our improved simulations including alfvn wave effects :    \\1 .",
    "the postshock pressures , @xmath139 and @xmath248 , approach time - asymptotic values quickly . at sufficiently strong shocks",
    "the postshock cr pressure is about 50 % of the shock ram pressure , while the normalized gas pressure drops from its gasdynamic value of 75 % .",
    "the normalized postshock gas pressure scales approximately inversely with the compression through the shock .",
    "the resulting total pressure in a strong cr modified shock will be reduced from that in an ordinary gas shock of the same initial mach number .",
    "typically a fraction of @xmath249 of the incoming thermal particles become crs through thermal leakage .",
    "a significant shock precursor develops in response to nonlinear feedback from the cr pressure , so that the subshock weakens to @xmath250 for the initial shock mach number @xmath251 .",
    "the subshock strength increases very slowly with total mach number in a balance between energy extracted by crs and heating of the precursor .    \\3 . in our present simulations heating in the precursor",
    "is dominated in strong shocks by alfvn wave dissipation .",
    "the resulting asymptotic density compression factor through the precursor can approximated by @xmath215 for @xmath252 , while the compression over the total transition can be approximated by @xmath253 for @xmath218 .",
