    "the analytical treatment of the dynamics of a macroscopic system of @xmath25 particles is not possible , in general .",
    "but there are situations which allow to simplify the dynamical description .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to classical systems .",
    "one of the prominent examples is brownian motion .",
    "a big particle with mass @xmath26 interacts with a solvent . if the solvent particles have a mass @xmath27 much smaller than @xmath26 a time scale separation exists . separating the fast motion of the solvent particles from that of the big one , called brownian particle , a langevin equation results for the motion of the brownian particle .",
    "the influence of the solvent particles occurs through a friction and a fluctuating force .",
    "these two are related to each other by the so - called fluctuation- dissipation theorem of second kind . for a general system with time scale separation ,",
    "the mori - zwanzig projection formalism @xcite allows to derive a langevin equation for the slow variables .",
    "if there is a single slow variable @xmath28 , then one gets @xcite",
    "@xmath29    where @xmath7 is a microscopic frequency , @xmath30 a memory kernel and @xmath31 the fluctuating force . elimination of a macroscopic number of fast degrees of freedom always leads to memory effects .",
    "if @xmath30 relaxes much faster then the average of @xmath32 , one can perform a markov approximation , i.e. @xmath33 . the analytical calculation of @xmath30 is not feasible , in general",
    ". however , there exists a class of models for which the exact elimination of a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom is possible , even if there is no time scale separation .",
    "these models we call kac - zwanzig models @xcite .",
    "they consist of a subsystem coupled to a macroscopic bath of _ harmonic _ oscillators .",
    "the subsystem can be microscopic , i.e. the number of its degrees of freedom is of order one or it can also be macroscopic with , e.g. 10@xmath34 degrees of freedom .",
    "since the equations of motion are linear in the oscillator coordinates , the harmonic degrees of freedom can be microscopic , i.e.  the number of its degrees of freedom is of order one or it can also be macroscopic with , e.g. 10@xmath34 degrees of freedom . as a result ,",
    "one obtains for the coordinates of the subsystem a stochastic differential equation of type of eq .. the memory kernel @xmath26 ( which is a matrix in general ) can be expressed by an integral over the frequencies of the harmonic bath .",
    "its spectral properties strongly influence the time dependence of @xmath26 and therefore that of the coordinates of the subsystem , too . in the langevin case where the spectrum is absolutely continuous with infinite support",
    ", the subsystem will relax to equilibrium for all of its initial conditions . in this case",
    ", the harmonic oscillators act as a normal thermostat .",
    "however , if , e.g.  that spectrum contains a dense discrete component as it occurs for harmonic systems with quenched disorder , the situation may be different .",
    "then , there exist initial conditions , which will not relax to equilibrium , but may converge to periodic , quasiperiodic or possibly weakly chaotic solutions .",
    "this behavior is closely related to the existence of spontaneous energy localization .",
    "+ spontaneous energy localization in large nonlinear discrete systems is now known as an ubiquitous phenomena related to the existence of discrete breathers ( dbs ) .",
    "when a sufficiently large amount of energy is injected locally in a system which may sustain dbs and which is initially at low temperature , it is found that although some part of this energy spreads over the system , a substantial part of this energy may remain localized as a db @xcite over very long time .",
    "the discovery of this kind of localized modes was so surprising because they existed in systems with discrete translational invariance in space .",
    "dbs also called _ intrinsic localized modes_(ilm ) are spatially localized time periodic solutions of discrete nonlinear hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "since many of them are linearly stable and thus can trap energy over long times , they should play an essential role in energy relaxation in complex systems .",
    "the existence of dbs has been rigorously proven by several methods and for a variety of models with optical or acoustic phonons , with or without gaps , in one or any dimension and without or with randomness @xcite .",
    "all these existence proofs require that the db frequency and its harmonics do not belong to the phonon spectrum ( obtained by linearization of the dynamical equations in the vicinity of the ground state ) .",
    "otherwise , the db would be expected to radiate energy in the phonon band and to decay .",
    "in addition , the proofs @xcite only concern the existence of _ out - of - band _ dbs , i.e. their frequencies and those of the higher harmonics are in the band gaps of the phonon spectrum . for certain models",
    "the existence of dbs was even proven before by albanse and frhlich @xcite and by albanse , frhlich and spencer @xcite under the requirement of randomness . in that case",
    "the eigenstates of the linear eigenvalue problem are already localized ( in dimensions larger than two the randomness has to be large enough ) and therefore it is more intuitive that localized time periodic solutions could persist in the presence of nonlinearities , although to prove this is highly nontrivial    when the phonon spectrum is discrete , for example in a strongly disordered system with anderson localization , energy radiation of linear phonons by a localized time periodic solution can not occur .",
    "then , the existence of _ intraband _ discrete breathers ( idbs ) with their frequency or some of their harmonics _ inside _ the phonon spectrum , might be a priori possible .",
    "indeed , numerical evidence @xcite suggested that such solutions do exist .",
    "more precisely , it was conjectured that for each localized anderson mode , there is an associated family of idbs with variable frequencies ( and amplitude ) , which converges to this anderson mode at the small amplitude limit .",
    "it was also conjectured that the idbs with respect to their frequency dependence do not form a continuous family of solutions as for ordinary ( out - of - band ) dbs , but are defined only on a fat cantor set of frequencies ( i.e. with nonvanishing lebesgue measure ) .",
    "a forbidden frequency gap is associated with each of the other frequencies of the linear anderson modes .",
    "these frequencies are dense in the linear phonon spectrum but the width of these gaps drops to zero very fast as a function of the spatial distance of the corresponding anderson mode of the center to the idb .",
    "then , the complementary cantor set of frequencies where the idb exists is non void with a strictly positive lebesgue measure .",
    "moreover , the measure density of this cantor set is expected to go to full measure when the amplitude of the idb goes to zero that is when the idb tends to be a linear mode .",
    "the idb should not be confused with so - called embedded solitons in discrete lattice systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these are nonlinear excitations with a _",
    "discrete _ frequency lying within the linear spectrum , whereas idb take frequencies from a set of full measure .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to idb the existence of embedded solitons requires exponentially localized linear modes .",
    "the first proof of existence of such idbs for a certain class of random models was done by albanse and frhlich @xcite and by albanse , frhlich and spencer @xcite .",
    "the models studied by these authors are the _ random _ , discrete schrdinger equation and the wave equation with a cubic nonlinearity .",
    "a perturbational approach was used to prove that all periodic solutions of the linear equation can be continued for small enough @xmath35 , the strength of nonlinearity .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath35 it was proven that there exist at least certain periodic solutions . transforming a _ random _ , nonlinear dynamical system without acoustic phonons into anderson space , i.e. to the space of the localized eigenstates of the linear problem and restricting to nearest neighbor interactions in anderson space , frhlich , spencer and wayne @xcite",
    "have even proven ( under certain conditions ) the existence of localized _ almost periodic _ solutions , i.e. of kam tori .    besides the existence of idbs",
    ", it was also conjectured in @xcite the existence of families of multibreather states which exhibit several energy peaks associated with different anderson modes .",
    "we may explain intuitively this conjecture by the fact that the frequency of a nonlinear mode depends on its amplitude .",
    "it is thus possible to tune the amplitude of an arbitrary number of different anderson modes in order they get the same frequency . despite nonlinear modes can not be simply superposed as in the linear case , a time periodic multibreather solution can be constructed numerically .",
    "when , the number of idbs involved in the multibreather state is infinite , these multibreather states are spatially extended and able to transport energy by phase torsion @xcite . as a result , nonlinearity restores the ability of the system to transport energy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an exact proof of these conjectures for a _ special _ class of random models where the underlying physical arguments appear explicitly .",
    "these models , consisting of a microscopic or macroscopic anharmonic subsystem coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators , are designed on one hand for obtaining simpler mathematical proofs and on the other hand to contain nevertheless the essential features , e.g.  for the trajectories @xmath6 of the anharmonic system , which can be found in more general complex and realistic models .",
    "although these results do not provide a rigorous proof ( in the mathematical sense ) for general and fully anharmonic systems , they nevertheless make clearer the fundamental reasons for their existence and thus support the earlier conjecture that they might exist in general .",
    "particulary , we will derive for rather general anharmonic and harmonic subsystems(arbitrary dimension , with or without disorder ) an exact formula which relates the energy dissipation rate @xmath36 of the anharmonic system averaged over a time interval of length @xmath9 to the fourier transform @xmath37 of the dissipation kernels @xmath4 and to @xmath38 , the fourier transform of the velocity - velocity correlation functions of the trajectories @xmath6 . for finite initial energy and",
    "bounded hamiltonian from below it is @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "this will yield the nonoverlapping criterion for the support of @xmath41 and @xmath42 which will have consequences for the possible asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 for @xmath43 .",
    "calculation of the energy dissipation rate @xmath44 for a sinusoidal force with frequency @xmath7 will demonstrate the existence of extreme sensitivity of the dissipated energy by that force on its frequency @xmath7 . compared to ordinary dissipation where @xmath45 ,",
    "superdissipative and subdissipative behavior may occur for which @xmath8 increases , respectively , faster and slower than @xmath9 .",
    "we will also show that there exists a set of full measure such that @xmath8 is bounded for all @xmath7 in that set , i.e.  no energy dissipation exists at all .",
    "the possibility of no energy dissipation allows the existence of periodic solutions @xmath46 , also within the phonon band . we will show that such idb exist with frequencies on a fat cantor set . in that case relaxation to equilibrium",
    "is prohibited such that the harmonic bath acts as an _ anomalous _ thermostat .",
    "this behavior is related to the pioneering work of fermi , pasta and ulam , which has given evidence for nonergodic dynamics .",
    "new results confirm that ergodicity in phase space of large and complex dynamical systems is not as smooth as it was believed through langevin bath theory .",
    "when starting from initial states which are not at thermal equilibrium , there are many _ islands _ in phase space which may trap the state of the system for long time and could result in unusual and slow relaxation processes toward the thermal equilibrium .",
    "in order to keep our presentation selfcontained we review and discuss properties of linear spectra which have been proven earlier or are well - admitted in order to define a model and an associated set of hypothesis which could match with the different physical situations . our purpose is to describe the main characteristics which could be expected for large families of nonlinear random models with linear spectrum involving both discrete and continuous components .",
    "continuous spectra occur only in the thermodynamic limit , i.e.  for an infinite system .    in order to fix the ideas ,",
    "let us consider as an example a random model on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice , for example a klein - gordon type model with hamiltonian @xmath47 where the momentum @xmath48 is the variable conjugate to the displacement @xmath49 at site @xmath50 .",
    "the local potential @xmath51 is random .",
    "for example it could have the form    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is chosen according to some probability law @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 denotes the bonds which connect neighboring sites @xmath56 ( counted once ) .",
    "accordingly , the sum in eq . is a double sum over all @xmath50 and @xmath57 which are nearest neighbors .",
    "@xmath58 is the constant of the harmonic coupling between nearest neighbors , which is assumed to be identical for all nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "the dynamical equations are @xmath59 @xmath60 denotes the sites @xmath57 which are nearest neighbors to @xmath50 ,",
    "i.e.  the sum in eq . is a single sum over @xmath57 which are nearest neighbors of @xmath50 .",
    "dbs are spatially localized time periodic solutions of eq .. thus , their amplitude must decay to zero at infinity .",
    "consequently , we may approximate this dynamical system by another dynamical one which obeys the same eq .",
    "for the few sites @xmath50 where the amplitudes of the db is not small and the linearized equations @xmath61 for all the other sites @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the system becomes equivalent to a finite anharmonic system coupled linearly by local interactions to a harmonic system ( phonon bath ) .",
    "note , we start with a finite harmonic system and finally take the thermodynamic limit . for a finite harmonic system",
    "the linear spectrum is always discrete .",
    "this kind of approximation strongly simplifies the investigation of dbs . assuming the existence of time periodic solutions ( dbs ) of the _ isolated _ anharmonic system ( i.e.  uncoupled with the harmonic phonon bath ) we will discuss under which conditions these solutions could persist when the coupling to the phonon bath is non vanishing , although not too large .",
    "this harmonic phonon bath considered uncoupled to the anharmonic system , is characterized by its frequency spectrum .",
    "when the frequency of the db and its harmonics do not belong to the frequency spectrum of the phonon bath , the proof that the db solutions can be continued to nonzero coupling can be obtained as in @xcite .",
    "this will be performed in the @xmath62 section . when the frequency of the db , one of its harmonics or several belong to the frequency spectrum of the phonon bath , it is essential to consider whether this phonon spectrum is discrete or continuous .    figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , respectively , show possible schemes representing situations where the linear phonons are either spatially extended or localized at the db frequency .",
    "the model we propose is simply to consider the system as harmonic in the regions where the amplitude of the db is expected to be small and to keep it anharmonic in the region where the solution has a large amplitude .",
    "of course , our model shall depend on the location of the idb or multidbs we consider since it determines the selection of the anharmonic subsystem .",
    "this kind of simplification also allows to investigate the relaxation of an arbitrary localized initial excitation .",
    "if the finite initial energy is spread completely over the system the displacements become arbitrary small and the linearization of eq .",
    "is allowed for large enough times . however ,",
    "if the spreading is incomplete , we are allowed to linearize eq . outside the localized region .",
    "when @xmath63 is _ uniformly _ small , the linearized equations which yield the linear phonon spectrum are @xmath64 which has time periodic solutions of the form @xmath65 .",
    "the eigenfrequencies @xmath66 and eigenmodes @xmath67 obey the eigenequation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the matrix of the second order variation of the potential energy from its ground state .",
    "the eigenfrequencies @xmath70 should not be confused with the frequencies @xmath53 of the small amplitude oscillations in the local potential @xmath51 .",
    "it has been proven @xcite that the linear spectrum of eq .",
    "is discrete and its eigenvectors ( anderson modes ) are square summable and exponentially localized with probability one , when either the spatial dimension is less than three or the coupling is not too large . at larger coupling and",
    "when the dimension of the lattice is at least three , it is believed that there exist mobility edges in the spectrum ( although no rigorous proof is available up to now ) .",
    "there are two mobility edges which determine a central interval where the spectrum is continuous .",
    "the corresponding eigenmodes are extended and non square summable . in two intervals limited by the edge of the spectrum ,",
    "the spectrum is discrete and the corresponding eigenmodes are square summable and exponentially localized .",
    "more generally , we may consider nonlinear models on arbitrary discrete lattices where the small amplitude solution leads to the eigenvalue equation    @xmath71    for an arbitrary positive bounded self - adjoint linear operator @xmath72 operating in the hilbert space @xmath73 where @xmath74 represent the sites of an infinite discrete lattice @xmath13 in @xmath75 dimensions ( or any discrete network ) , with the standard hermitian product @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "since we consider physical systems which have to be linearly stable , we must assume the spectrum to be positive or zero and then , the eigenvalues @xmath78 are the square of the eigenmode frequencies",
    ". we may also consider systems with acoustic phonons where the spectrum is gapless and contains the translation mode @xmath79 associated with zero eigenfrequency which is always extended .",
    "standard mathematical theories decompose the spectrum @xmath80 of such a self - adjoint bounded linear operator @xmath72 in three parts : the absolutely continuous spectrum , the discrete spectrum and the singular continuous spectrum @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the spectrum manifests itself in finite size systems in the limit of large size @xmath25 as explained now .",
    "the eigenvalue equation restricted to a finite subset @xmath81 of @xmath25 indices of @xmath13 corresponds to the diagonalization of a finite self - adjoint matrix @xmath82 which yields @xmath25 orthogonal and normalized eigensolutions @xmath83 with compact support @xmath81 corresponding to real eigenvalues . taking @xmath84 such that the finite support tends to cover the infinite lattice @xmath85 , the nonvanishing accumulation points for the weak topology @xmath86 of the eigensolutions of finite systems @xmath83 are eigensolutions of eq .",
    "for an eigenvalue @xmath87 , the corresponding limit of @xmath88 . the nonvanishing limit solutions",
    "are necessarily square summable with a nonzero norm smaller or equal to @xmath89 and thus can be normalized .",
    "this set of square summable eigensolutions @xmath90 with eigenvalues @xmath91 determines the discrete spectrum of @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath13 is countable , the discrete set of normalized eigenvectors is also countable ( or finite ) .",
    "the inverse rate of the exponential decay of the eigenmodes determines the so called localization length which is a smooth function of the eigenfrequency and diverges when approaching mobility edges . in systems with acoustic phonons in 3 dimensions and more , it is believed that the spectrum becomes continuous in a nonvanishing positive interval close to zero and then there is only one mobility edge .",
    "extended states ( e.g. plane waves ) are not square summable and their norm diverges proportionally to the system size @xmath25 .",
    "these eigenstates can be nevertheless obtained as nonvanishing accumulations points of @xmath92 .",
    "this set of nonsquare summable solutions and their corresponding eigenvalues of the eigenvalue equation are usually called pseudo eigensolutions and pseudo eigenvalues .",
    "they corresponds to the absolutely continuous spectrum of @xmath72 .",
    "they form uncountable continua .",
    "the limits of the other finite size eigenstates which behave spatially differently for example which develop a fractal structure at large scale or which exhibit algebraic decay at infinity , determine the remaining part of the spectrum which is the singular continuous spectrum of @xmath72 .",
    "although there are examples of operators with purely singular continuous spectrum ( for example with quasiperiodic potentials ) , their contribution to the spectrum of most operators is expected to be marginal , generally , and then it reduces to few isolated specific points of the spectrum ( corresponding to the mobility edges ) .",
    "the spectrum of an operator @xmath72 ( for example random ) is a closed subset @xmath80 of the real axis",
    ". it might be purely absolutely continuous ( for example for operators with spatial periodicity ) or purely discrete ( for example for operators in 1d with randomness or higher dimension with strong disorder ) or it might decompose into two disconnected subsets @xmath93 and @xmath94 where the spectrum is discrete and absolutely continuous , respectively , separated by mobility edges .",
    "this situation is supposed to occur for random operators in 3 dimensions and more at weak enough disorder@xcite .",
    "considering now again , the nonlinear system at the anticontinuous limit @xmath95 , it simply becomes a collection of uncoupled nonlinear oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath96 and thus is trivially integrable .",
    "it is then convenient to represent each anharmonic oscillator with the standard action - angle variables @xmath97 .",
    "then , the local hamiltonian @xmath98 is only a function of its action @xmath99 , and its frequency is @xmath100 .",
    "note , that @xmath101 should not be confused with the frequencies @xmath53 in eq .. time periodic solutions at frequency @xmath7 are obtained by choosing each oscillator @xmath50 either at rest or oscillating at frequency @xmath102 if there exists @xmath99 such that this equality may be fulfilled .",
    "the solution corresponding to a discrete breather at site @xmath50 and at frequency @xmath7 is obtained by choosing all the oscillators @xmath103 at rest , except oscillator @xmath50 which is oscillating at frequency @xmath7 .    at @xmath95 , the linear spectrum of eigenfrequencies defined by eq . is the _ closure _ @xmath104 of the set of linear frequencies .",
    "considering a db solution at the anticontinuous limit at site @xmath50 and at a frequency @xmath7 which is nonresonant with the linear spectrum ( that is @xmath105 for any integer @xmath106 ) , and fulfills the condition that @xmath107 at @xmath108 , it was proven by the implicit function theorem @xcite , that this solution can be continued as a spatially localized solution for @xmath109 belonging to a nonvanishing interval .    when @xmath110 , the proof for the db existence given in @xcite which requires the invertibility of @xmath111 breaks down . however , numerical investigations suggested the existence of stable idbs with frequency @xmath110 although they are not continuous functions of the model parameters .",
    "otherwise , this numerical work also suggested the existence of intraband multisite breathers called multibreathers .",
    "a direct proof of existence of idb in fully anharmonic models is likely possible ( as an extension of the present work ) but it should be more complex for technical reasons than in the simplified model we propose .",
    "we think , however , that this model captures the essential physical features of general nonlinear random models .",
    "we denote by @xmath112 the set of variables which describe the coupled anharmonic oscillators and by @xmath113 their conjugate variables .",
    "this subsystem is described by an anharmonic hamiltonian    @xmath114    without restricting generality the masses are chosen to be equal to one .",
    "the single anharmonic oscillator where @xmath115 is a scalar , is the simplest but a special case .",
    "this anharmonic part is linearly coupled to an infinite harmonic system described by the set of variables @xmath116 and conjugate momenta @xmath117 where the indices @xmath50 are nodes of an arbitrary network .",
    "the harmonic hamiltonian is @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a bounded self - adjoint operator and @xmath24 denotes transposition .",
    "again , the masses can be taken equal to unity without lack of generality .",
    "the total hamiltonian takes the form @xmath120 where the matrix of coupling constants is @xmath121 and @xmath35 is introducted for convenience .",
    "these coupling constants are short ranged that is @xmath122 .",
    "it is more convenient to describe the harmonic system as a collection of noninteracting harmonic oscillators @xmath123 which corresponds to its normal modes .",
    "the normal mode coordinates of the harmonic oscillators of the phonon bath are now the coefficients @xmath124 of the expansion of @xmath63 with respect to the normalized eigenmodes @xmath125 with frequency @xmath126 which fulfills @xmath127 .",
    "they are now coupled to the anharmonic system by the set of coefficients @xmath128 or explicitly @xmath129 .    as we assumed above , the set of coupling constants @xmath130 between @xmath115 and @xmath49",
    "are short ranged . in most physical situations",
    ", they decay exponentially , that is there exists two positive constants @xmath131 and @xmath132 such that @xmath133 thus , we may assume the stronger @xmath134 condition @xmath135 without loosing much generality .",
    "then , we obtain a total hamiltonian of the form @xmath136    the reorganization energy @xmath137 is the change in the groundstate energy of the whole system under the constraint of a static displacement @xmath138 of the anharmonic oscillators .",
    "it is obtained by minimizing the last two terms of the energy ( [ phb ] ) with respect to @xmath124 for fixed @xmath115 .",
    "this readily yields @xmath139 where @xmath140 in well - behaved physical models , this sum is always finite since any _ finite _ static displacement @xmath115 should involve a _",
    "finite _ reorganization energy ( and a finite force ) .",
    "this condition requires the assumption that the positive definite series ( ) is always absolutely convergent .",
    "for example , the case of models with acoustic modes where one of the @xmath126 may vanish because there is always a mode at zero frequency ( which corresponds to the free motion of the `` center of mass '' of the whole system ) .",
    "this feature may cause a divergency for coefficients of series ( [ hypf1 ] ) .",
    "but in the limit of low frequency , these ( acoustic ) phonon modes decouple from the local degree of freedom describing the anharmonic part of the system ( @xmath141 ) and thus this reorganization energy ( [ hypf1 ] ) remains finite since @xmath142 is linear or even of higher order in @xmath11 for @xmath143 .",
    "the reorganization energy @xmath137 renormalizes the potential energy of the anharmonic subsystem , i.e.  we can introduce an effective energy @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian ( [ phb ] ) may be written as @xmath145    where @xmath146 is the harmonic displacement minimizing the last two terms of , for fixed @xmath115 .",
    "since we did not specify properties of the harmonic subsystem , which is considered as very general , it is now necessary to introduce some assumptions at this level for ensuring our model to be physically realistic .",
    "the density of the positive eigenfrequencies @xmath126 of the harmonic bath ( called density of states ) is the limit of the positive measure defined as @xmath147 in physical situations , it is generally an absolutely continuous measure , dense on a finite interval ( that is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a measurable positive function ) .",
    "but this assumption is not necessary and moreover does not characterize whether the phonon spectrum is discrete or continuous .",
    "for example , in spatially periodic harmonic systems the whole phonon spectrum is absolutely continuous with extended eigenstates which are planewaves . in random anderson models in three dimensions and at weak enough disorder ,",
    "the phonon spectrum @xmath80 may split into two disconnected sets @xmath150 which consists of a central interval @xmath94 where the spectrum is supposed to be absolutely continuous ( corresponding to extended eigenstates ) and the union @xmath93 of two side intervals where the spectrum is supposed to be discrete ( and corresponding to square summable eigenstates ) .",
    "these intervals are separated by mobility edges ( isolated points ) . at large disorder in 3d or at lower dimension for any disorder , the whole spectrum is discrete and consists of a single interval @xmath93 .    actually , in all these examples , the density of states is an absolutely continuous measure which does not determine a priori whether or not the phonon spectrum is continuous or discrete .",
    "note also that in the case of random potentials , the density of states depends only on the statistical properties of the potential and not on the realizations .",
    "the characteristics of the spectrum ( absolutely continuous , singular continuous or discrete ) appears in our model through the properties of the distribution of coupling constants @xmath151 .",
    "they determine the properties of the kernel which appears after elimination of the harmonic variables and which shall be discussed later .",
    "models for an anharmonic system coupled to a harmonic phonon bath are ubiquitous in physics for describing relaxation processes , for example chemical reactions within kramers theory @xcite . however , in those applications the spectrum of the harmonic bath was always assumed to be absolutely continuous . in that case ,",
    "standard calculations yield after elimination of the phonon bath variables , extra damping terms for the anharmonic system ( plus langevin random forces , if the temperature is not zero ) . when there is a discrete spectrum , the results are totally different , as we shall see now .",
    "the well - known advantage of a coupling with a harmonic phonon bath is that it is straightforward to eliminate the variables of the phonon bath in order to get effective equations for the anharmonic variables @xcite ( we already took advantage of such a situation for proving the existence of ( interband ) discrete breathers in systems with acoustic phonons @xcite ) .      making use of eqs . and",
