    "a more serious problem , however , is that each of the ion and electron parts often needs to be considered beyond the limits of the quasistatic and impact approximations .",
    "in particular , the ion motion in plasma leads to the so  called ion dynamics effects .",

    "the method was further improved in ref .",
    "@xcite by using molecular  dynamics ( md ) simulations for the ions , thus accounting for interactions between the radiators and the ion perturbers . in refs .",
    "@xcite the motion of both ions and electrons was numerically simulated .",
    "the particle motion was simulated using straight path trajectories , which is applicable when the correlations between the perturbers and radiator are neglected . later , the area of applicability was extended by using hyperbolic @xcite and , recently , exact paths for the perturbers ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "@xcite the model was based on one  component plasmas ( ocps ) treating the full spectrum as a superposition of the electronic and ionic contributions and thus neglects the influence of the attractive interactions between electrons and ions .",
    "this is well justified for weakly coupled plasma where the ionic and electronic fields can be handled separately for spectra modeling .",
    "but there is an increasing number of experiments of interest which are far beyond such parameter regimes ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in such cases",
    "a simple superposition of the electronic and ionic fields becomes insufficient due to strong nonlinear effects and the total field in a two  component plasmas ( tcp ) should serve as the starting point for spectra modeling .",

    "the md simulations in conjunction with the schrdinger equation to study the line shapes in a tcp have been previously considered in ref .",

    ", the ratio of the thermal energy and the fermi energy must fulfill @xmath29 . since an ion is much heavier than an electron this condition",
    "is usually fulfilled for ions",
    ". therefore one can expect that the regularization given by eq .   is less important for ions than for electrons .",
    "furthermore , scattering of any two particles is classical for impact parameters that are large compared to the de broglie wavelengths @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the reduced mass of the particles @xmath4 and @xmath32 .",

    "let us now briefly discuss the limitations of the md model arising from the classical description of the electrons , i.e. , from the neglect of the quantum effects in the short  range electron  ion interaction . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite two constraints on the parameter @xmath24 determining the regularized potential must be considered . in the parameter regime when a significant fraction of the simulated electrons is found in the quasibound states the simulated @xmath49 and @xmath50 are effectively reduced and the md simulations are not adequate .",

    "the minimal value of @xmath61 occurs at @xmath62 .",
    "it is thus clear that for @xmath63 the capture of the electrons onto classical orbits becomes important and the significant contribution from the classically bound electrons can not be avoided in the md models with point  like classical electrons .        the electric microfield distribution ( mfd ) @xmath64 plays a central role for the line shape .",
    "models for this distribution exist in the limits of an ideal plasma @xcite , a weakly coupled plasma @xcite and for very strongly coupled plasmas @xcite . for intermediate cases an effective independent  particle model known as adjustable parameter exponential ( apex )",

    "@xcite for an ionic ocp .",

    "the behavior of the mfd with respect to the variation of the parameter @xmath24 is particularly noteworthy .",
    "for fixed coupling parameters the maximum of the mfd shifts only slightly to lower field strengths @xmath86 with increasing @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , while the maximum itself increases with @xmath24 .",
    "this is related to the largest possible single ",
    "particle field @xmath87 , which an electron can produce at the ion .",
    "thus the nearest neighbor electronic mfd vanishes for electric fields larger than @xmath88 , and smaller @xmath24 will result in larger contributions to @xmath64 at higher fields @xmath86 with a corresponding reduction of @xmath64 at small fields . therefore , the formation of the tails in the mfd and enhancement of the electric microfield at small @xmath24 may have important influence on the spectral line shapes of the radiating particles .",

    "in this paper we have presented a model for spectral lines that works without some assumptions which underly the conventional impact and quasi  static approximations . in particular",
    "we ( i ) consider two  component plasma ( tcp ) with attractive interactions between electrons and ions , ( ii ) account for the strong coulomb correlations between plasma particles , ( iii ) account for radiator states including the continuum , which are not directly involved in the transition , ( iv ) allow for a non  perturbative treatment .",
    "we have compared our model with recent experiments on al targets and found good agreement for the ly@xmath0transitions .",

    "( i ) the dipole approximation in eq .   for the interaction of the microfield with the radiator suffices for the present experiments @xcite . in even denser plasmas",
    "one must account for close collisions between the radiator and the plasma particles with a quadrupole term in the expansion of the interaction and finally with an exact treatment @xcite .",

    "( iii ) the major he  like satellite is well separated from the ly@xmath132line in the experiment @xcite",
    ". however , there will be closer satellites due to spectator electrons in higher configurations , which may affect the `` red '' shoulder of the line . for spectators in the continuum",
    "this effect merges into the dpls .",
    "the satellites impose a challenge as they offer an additional tool to determine the temperature of the plasma , see , e.g. ref .  @xcite . for that purpose",
