    "the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) is a long - standing puzzle .",
    "observations of cosmic rays with energy above @xmath2 ev reveal that the gzk cutoff @xcite in the energy spectrum is not observed by agasa @xcite ( though it seems to be consistent with hires @xcite ) , and that the arrival directions of cosmic rays are quite isotropic at large scales but cluster at small angles@xcite .",
    "this is a perplexing situation for seeking uhecr sources .",
    "the isotropic distribution of uhecr arrival directions , in the absence of strong magnetic field which can produce it , either galactic or extragalactic , implies that the sources are distributed over a few hundred mpc for which the matter distribution looks homogeneous , while the absence of the gzk cutoff implies that the uhecr sources are within the gzk radius which is about 50 mpc .",
    "the observed correlations of uhecr with bl lacertae objects @xcite do not make the situation easier : although perfectly consistent with clustering , bl lacs as sources of uhecr can not explain super - gzk events under assumption of standard physics @xcite .",
    "a possible way to reconcile these contradictory facts is to assume that , apart from uhecr accelerated in bl lacs , there exists a second , gzk - violating component @xcite originating from decays or annihilation of superheavy particles within the gzk radius @xcite .",
    "these superheavy particles are produced in the early universe @xcite and constitute a fraction of cold dark matter .",
    "the latter is concentrated in galactic halos .",
    "since we are 8.5 kpc away from the galactic center , the clear signature of superheavy particle decays is the significant excess of the uhecr flux from the direction of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "this kind of anisotropy toward the galactic center ( or toward any other strong source ) has not been observed by the northern hemisphere arrays @xcite .",
    "however , northern arrays do not see the galactic center directly , and the small statistics of cosmic rays with energy above the gzk cutoff makes it difficult to draw strong constraints .    in this paper",
    "we use the sugar data @xcite to examine the viability of the superheavy dark matter ( shdm ) scenario of uhecr , for sugar is the unique experiment which operated in the southern hemisphere before pierre auger observatory and covered the galactic center .",
    "we use the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to check the consistency of the sugar data with the arrival direction distribution expected from superheavy particle decays in the galactic halo .",
    "our purpose is to limit a fraction of uhecr which are produced by this mechanism .",
    "we perform the analysis in two steps . in sects .",
    "ii and iii we analyze the sugar data and derive bounds on the relative weight @xmath3 of the _ halo component _ in the total uhecr flux .",
    "these bounds are presented in figures  3 and 4 .",
    "they depend exclusively on the halo profile and statistics of sugar data .",
    "we then move in sect .",
    "iv to the implications of these constraints for the superheavy dark matter models .",
    "the difference with the previous case is that shdm contribution contains _ both galactic and extragalactic _ parts .",
    "their relative weight depends on a particular shdm model ( spectrum and maximum energy ) and on absolute dark matter density in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "because of the uncertainties in these parameters we separate this question from the more robust analysis of sects.ii and iii .",
    "we will see , however , that in shdm models the extragalactic contribution is generically subdominant in the energy range of interest , and therefore boudns of secs.ii and iii apply to shdm part of cosmic rays as a whole .",
    "we present our conclusions in sect.v .",
    "we assume that superheavy particles constitute a part of cold dark matter and their spatial distribution follows the dark matter density .",
    "we examine two different galactic halo models .",
    "the first one is the isothermal ( iso ) halo model @xcite , which is characterized by the density profile @xmath4 the second one is the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) model @xcite , which is obtained from the @xmath5-body simulation and thus can be more realistic @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the distance from the galactic center , @xmath8 is the scale of the halo core , and @xmath9 is the characteristic scale of the nfw model . for our galaxy , the size of @xmath8 is supposed to be a few kpc .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is expected to be @xmath10@xmath11 kpc on the basis of correlation between the predicted total mass and the value of @xmath9 @xcite . in our analysis , we leave @xmath8 and @xmath9 as free parameters and use @xmath12 kpc and @xmath13 kpc as prototype values .    for cosmic rays coming from the galactic halo , the expansion of the universe and the evolution of halo can be neglected .",
    "we also neglect the effects of the galactic magnetic field on the propagation of uhecr and will make a comment on it afterward . since we consider the halo model which is spherically symmetric about the galactic center and the distribution of sources follows the halo profile , the cosmic ray flux can be calculated as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the luminosity of cosmic ray sources , @xmath16 is the angle measured from the galactic center direction , which is related to the galactic coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the extension of the galactic halo , and @xmath22  kpc is the distance to the earth from the galactic center . in the case of decay ,",
    "the luminosity @xmath15 is proportional to the number density of superheavy particles , that is @xmath23 . in the case of annihilation",
    ", @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "since the density profile has a peak at the galactic center , the annihilation case predicts stronger anisotropy than the decay case and leads to stronger constraints on the halo contribution to uhecrs . in the following",
    ", we will consider the decay case only .    to obtain the arrival direction distribution predicted from the galactic halo model",
    ", we use the monte - carlo simulation based on the flux ( [ eq - flux ] ) . in simulating cosmic ray data detected by an array of detectors",
    ", we also need to consider the exposure function of the detector array . here",
    ", we use the simple geometrical exposure function which is a function of declination @xmath26 only @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the latitude of the detector array , @xmath29 is the zenith angle cut , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 otherwise .",
    "the sugar array , located in the southern hemisphere , has the latitude @xmath36 .",
    "it covered the galactic center direction best so far , because other detectors are all located in northern hemisphere and cover the galactic center marginally at best .",
    "therefore , the sugar data is most suited at the moment for the study of cosmic rays coming from the galactic halo , though in the near future pierre auger array will provide much better data .",
    "the published sugar data contain events with zenith angle up to 72@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we use the data with zenith angle smaller than 60@xmath38 considering increasing uncertainty at large zenith angles .",
    "figure  1 shows arrival directions of 316 sugar events with zenith angles @xmath39 and energy @xmath40  ev ( upper panel ) , and simulated data obtained using the flux ( [ eq - flux ] ) for two halo models ( lower panels ) .",
    "note that the nfw model with @xmath13 kpc and the isothermal model with @xmath12 kpc predict similar concentration of events around the galactic center .     and",
    "energy @xmath40 ev .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) show @xmath41 simulated events for the isothermal halo model with @xmath12 kpc and the nfw halo model with @xmath13 kpc , respectively .",

    "the most direct way to compare the arrival direction distribution of the real data and that predicted by the superheavy dark matter model is to use the two - dimensional k - s test over the pair @xmath43 or @xmath44 . here , we use a different method which is simpler and gives better results .",
    "since the cosmic rays in the halo model are distributed symmetrically around the galactic center , we analyze the distribution of cosmic rays over the angle @xmath16 between their arrival directions and the direction to the galactic center .",
    "we use the one - dimensional k - s test to compare the sugar data and model predictions .",
    "since one - dimensional k - s test is reparametrization - invariant , we use @xmath45 which is more convenient in computation .",
    "the k - s test makes use of the cumulative probability distribution function , which is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath5 is the number of data points . for the distribution of arrival directions expected in the galactic halo model",
    ", we generate large number @xmath47 of simulated events and obtain corresponding cumulative distribution @xmath48 .",
    "we then calculate the k - s statistic @xmath49 which determines the probability that the two sets of events are drawn from the same distribution @xcite .",
    "small probabilities indicate that the two sets significantly differ .",
    "figure  2 shows the cumulative distribution functions used in the k - s test .",
    "the difference between the sugar data and halo models is clearly seen ( it can be expected already from figure  1 ) .     and @xmath50 ev , solid ) , @xmath51 simulated data of isotropic distribution ( dash - dotted ) , the isothermal halo model ( @xmath12 kpc , dashed ) , and the nfw halo model ( @xmath13 kpc , dotted).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as mentioned in the introduction , the shdm model does not explain clustering and correlations of uhecr with bl lacs , so another ( extragalactic ) component is needed which is isotropic at large angles .",
    "the shdm model itself contains the isotropic extragalactic contribution coming from shdm decays in other galaxies .",
    "thus , let us consider a generic model where uhecr flux consists of the isotropic and galactic halo components ( their relative strength in the shdm models is discussed in the next section ) .",
    "an important quantity is the fraction @xmath3 of cosmic rays coming from the galactic halo , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the energy spectra of cosmic rays from the galactic halo and from the uniform background , respectively .",
    "we consider @xmath3 as a function of the lower energy cut @xmath55 .",
    "when two spectra @xmath53 and @xmath54 have quite different shape , @xmath56 depends sensitively on the value of @xmath55 . instead of following a specific model to evaluate @xmath56",
    ", we use @xmath3 as a parameter and calculate the probability to get the sugar data distribution . in this way bounds on @xmath3 at a given energy cut can be obtained .",

    "one thing one should check is the influence of the galactic magnetic field during the propagation .",
    "this can be important because significant portion of cosmic rays from the galactic halo are produced near the galactic center and experience strong magnetic fields . to see the effect of this spread on our results",
    ", we added a gaussian random deflections with mean deviation up to @xmath75 in the simulated data set .",
    "this effect also mimics possible poor angular resolution of sugar events .",
    "we found that results presented above are stable against this modification .",
    "the maximum change occurs at @xmath76 ev and @xmath77 . for the moderate energy cut or with the uniform background component added ,",
    "its effect becomes less than 10% and can be completely neglected .",
    "in order to see what the above constraints imply for a given shdm model , one has to estimate the strength of the halo ( anisotropic ) component relative to the extragalactic ( isotropic ) one .",
    "the latter consists of a part related to shdm decays outside of the galaxy and a part due to astrophysical sources .",
    "let us estimate the former .",
    "the galactic and extragalactic contributions in the shdm model can be written as @xmath78 @xmath79 here @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the average and halo dark matter densities , @xmath82 is the vector from galactic center to the earth , while @xmath83 is the weight function which accounts for the flux attenuation at large distances .",
    "the proportionality coefficient @xmath84 which accounts for the efficiency of uhecr production from shdm is the same in both cases .",
    "it therefore cancels in the ratio of the two contributions .",
    "the extragalactic part can be written in the form @xmath85 where by definition @xmath86 .",
    "this quantity represents the size of the region from which the extragalactic flux is collected ( for instance , for very high - energy protons @xmath87 is the gzk distance ) .",
    "it can be estimated as the attenuation length divided by the spectral index .",
    "the factor @xmath88 in this equation takes into account the fact that sugar sees roughly half of the sky .    to estimate the halo contribution we take the nfw profile at @xmath13  kpc and calculate the flux coming from half of a sphere overlooking the galactic center .",
    "the result can be written as follows , @xmath89 when obtaining this number the ratio of the local to average dark matter density was taken to be @xmath90 .",
    "this number is uncertain by a factor 2 or so .",
    "the ratio of the two components is @xmath91 the uhecr flux in the shdm models is dominated by photons which have attenuation length less than 100  mpc in the range of energies @xmath92  ev even at very weak assumptions about radio photon background @xcite .",
    "we therefore arrive at the conclusion that in the shdm models the halo component dominates already at energies around @xmath2  ev , i.e. , quite below the gzk cutoff .",
    "since the halo component dominates , the bounds on the fraction @xmath3 in figures  3 and 4 essentially apply to the total fraction of uhecr which originate from decays of shdm particles .",
    "the situation becomes even better at high energies where the extragalactic component dies away and the halo contribution reaches 100% . in this energy range @xmath93",
    "uniformly distributed events would be enough to rule out the shdm model at @xmath94 level following the technique developed here .",
    "we have used the sugar data to check the viability of the hypothesis that a part of the highest - energy cosmic rays originate from decays of relic shdm particles .",
    "we found that the absence of the anisotropy toward the galactic center in the sugar data imposes strong constraints on corresponding fraction of uhecr . at 95% confidence level",
    ", the fraction of shdm - related cosmic rays should be less than 20% and 50% at @xmath0  ev and @xmath1  ev , respectively .",
    "this implies that the shdm component of uhecr , if exists , must have harder spectrum than the uniform one and should take over at energies higher than @xmath95  ev .",
