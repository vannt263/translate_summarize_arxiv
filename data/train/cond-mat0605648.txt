    "vortex dynamics in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has been studied intensively , initially in the context of superfluid helium and later in dilute trapped becs .",
    "the motion of vortices in both uniform and inhomogeneous condensates has been the subject of many theoretical works , and extensive reviews of these efforts have been given in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of vortex motion in an asymptotically homogeneous condensate in the presence of a solid wall where the wave function of the condensate vanishes .",
    "recent discussions ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) on the motion of vortices near the surface of trapped condensates have questioned the relevance of the method of images in describing this motion . in that case , the nonuniform condensate density is approximated by a linear function that vanishes at the thomas - fermi surface , and the vortex motion can be considered to arise principally from the local density gradient . here , we consider a rather different situation , in which the condensate density approaches its bulk value within a healing length @xmath2 , and the vortex is located in the asymptotically uniform region . in this latter case ,",
    "the local gradient of the condensate density is very small .",
    "the motion can be interpreted as arising from an image , but the depleted surface layer induces an effective shift in the position of the image in comparison with the case of a uniform incompressible fluid .",
    "our geometry is two dimensional , with the vortex aligned along the @xmath4 axis , parallel to the surface of the wall .",
    "the dynamics of the time - dependent bec in the presence of the solid wall at @xmath5 is described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath6 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath7 in dimensionless units , such that the distance is measured in healing lengths @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a two - dimensional coupling constant with dimension of energy times area , @xmath3 is the mass of the boson and @xmath10 is the bulk number density per unit area .",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath11 and energy in units of @xmath12 . in our units , the speed of sound @xmath13 in the bulk condensate is @xmath14 .    in the absence of vortices ,",
    "the exact solution of ( [ gp ] ) for the stationary state of the semi - infinite condensate is @xmath15 in classical inviscid fluid dynamics with constant mass density @xmath16 , the relevant kinematic boundary condition at a solid wall with normal vector @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the velocity of the fluid .",
    "the corresponding problem of a vortex moving parallel to the wall is solved by placing one or more image vortices in such a way that condition ( [ rhou ] ) is identically satisfied .    for the dynamics described by the gp equation ( [ gp ] ) , the density @xmath20 is no longer constant , but rather vanishes at the surface of the wall .",
    "thus condition ( [ rhou ] ) is automatically satisfied , and all components of @xmath21 can in principle remain finite on the boundary .",
    "therefore , it may seem that image vortices are irrelevant in the case of the gp equation , so that the vortex should remain stationary away from the boundary ( where the fluid density is constant apart from exponentially small corrections ) .",
    "our numerical simulations show that this is not true .",
    "in fact , the vortex moves parallel to the boundary , and it moves _ faster _ than a corresponding pair of vortices of opposite circulation in a uniform condensate in the absence of the depletion caused by the boundary .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to study this motion in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we find the family of disturbances moving with a constant velocity along the solid wall by numerically solving the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation in the frame of reference moving with the disturbance . in sec .",
    "iii a time - dependent lagrangian variational analysis is used to find the first two leading terms in the equation of the vortex motion in the limit of large distance from the wall . in sec .",
    "iv an alternative approach based on the dependence of total energy and momentum on the vortex position is used to determine the vortex velocity . in sec .",
    "v we summarize our main findings .",
    "in what follows we seek solitary - wave solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) that preserve their form as they move parallel to the wall with fixed velocity @xmath22 . for each value of the velocity @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 . the gp equation ( [ gp ] ) becomes @xmath25 where we set @xmath26 . in the absence of the wall , the solitary - wave solutions of eq .",

    ", this term vanishes because @xmath62 does so , but the image vortex ensures that the contribution vanishes even in the case of a uniform condensate .",
    "the image vortex also cuts off the long - range tail of the velocity , giving a convergent kinetic energy even for a semi - infinite condensate .",
