    "at present a vast amount of experimental data on the heavy quarkonium spectroscopy has been accumulated @xcite .",
    "the number of known states is constantly increasing .",
    "thus , in the last eight years more than ten new charmonium - like states have been discovered ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the total number of charmonium states , listed in the particle data group listings @xcite , is 25 at present . some of the new states ( such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . )",
    "are the long - awaited ones , expected by quark models many years ago , while some others , with masses higher than the threshold of the open charm production , have narrow widths and unexpected decay properties @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical indications that some of these new states could be the first manifestation of the existence of exotic hadrons ( tetraquarks , molecules , hybrids etc . ) , which are expected to exist in qcd ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in order to explore such options , a comprehensive understanding of the heavy quarkonium spectroscopy up to rather high orbital and radial excitations is required .",
    "the lhcb collaboration at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite plans to search for the bottom counterparts of the newly discovered charmonium - like states @xcite . at present , the experimentally known bottomonium spectrum consists of 14 states @xcite .",
    "moreover , new experimental data on the spectroscopy of @xmath0 mesons are expected from lhc @xcite .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the masses of the excited heavy quarkonia states represents an important and interesting problem .",
    "a reliable calculation of the masses of excited heavy quark - antiquark states will allow to single out experimental candidates for the exotic multiquark states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we calculated the mass spectra of charmonia , bottomonia and @xmath0 mesons on the basis of a three - dimensional relativistic quasipotential wave equation with a qcd - motivated potential . for this calculation ,",
    "a @xmath1 expansion up to the second order was used .",
    "masses of several lowest orbital and radial excitations were obtained , mainly for the states lying under the open flavour production threshold .",
    "this investigation indicated that the charm quark is not heavy enough to be considered as nonrelativistic , especially for excited states @xcite .",
    "therefore , a reliable consideration of the highly excited charmonium states requires a completely relativistic treatment of the charmed quark without an expansion in its velocity . in this paper",
    "we extend the approach previously used for the investigations of light meson spectroscopy @xcite , where relativistic quark dynamics was treated completely relativistically , to heavy quarkonia .",
    "then the relativistic quasipotential , which determines the quark dynamics in heavy quarkonia , is an extremely non - local function in the coordinate space . in order to make it local , we replace the quark energies , entering the quark spinors , with the corresponding on - mass - shell energies .",
    "such procedure makes the quasipotential local , but introduces a rather complicated nonlinear dependence on the bound state mass . the quasipotential equation with the complete relativistic potential",
    "can then be solved numerically using previously developed numerical methods @xcite . in order to improve our description , leading radiative corrections to the heavy quark potential @xcite",
    "are also taken into account .",
    "such corrections are suppressed by additional powers of @xmath9 , which are rather small for heavy quarkonia , and are known only in the framework of the @xmath1 expansion . therefore we treat them perturbatively .",
    "the calculation of the masses of highly orbitally and radially excited states up to the fifths excitation is carried out . on this basis ,",
    "the regge trajectories for charmonia , bottomonia and @xmath0 mesons can be constructed both in the total angular momentum @xmath4 and radial quantum number @xmath5 , and properties like linearity , parallelism and equidistance of these trajectories can be checked .",
    "there are reasons to expect that the parent regge trajectories can be nonlinear due to the compactness of their ground and lowest excited states , which puts them in the region where both the linear confining and coulomb parts of the quark - antiquark potential play an equally important role .",
    "note also that the possibility of the assignment of the experimentally observed highly excited heavy quarkonium states to a particular regge trajectory could help in determining their quantum numbers and elucidating their nature .    in recent papers",
    "@xcite we investigated the possible interpretation of some new unconventional charmonium - like states @xcite as diquark - antidiquark tetraquarks .",
    "in particular , the relativistic dynamical calculation of the masses of such states was performed .",
    "here we complement this study by calculating the spectrum of the highly excited conventional heavy quark - antiquark states in the same mass region . as a result",
    ", we will obtain a consistent picture of the recently discovered heavy quarkonium states within the same relativistic quark model .",
    "a vast literature on the heavy quarkonium spectroscopy is now available .",
    "therefore , we mostly refer to the recent comprehensive reviews @xcite , where the references to earlier review and original papers can be found .",

    "constructing the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction , we have assumed that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli interaction .",
    "the quasipotential is then defined by @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath9 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath22 is the gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dirac matrices and spinors and @xmath25 .",

    "indeed , estimates of the averaged velocity squared for the ground - state charmonium give the value @xmath43 .",
    "for excited charmonium states the @xmath44 values are even higher .",
    "therefore , a reliable calculation of the charmonium spectroscopy requires a completely relativistic treatment of the charmed quark without an expansion in its velocity .",
    "the quasipotential ( [ qpot ] ) can in principal be used for arbitrary quark masses .",
    "the substitution of the dirac spinors into ( [ qpot ] ) results in an extremely nonlocal potential in the configuration space .",

    "it was shown that the masses of the excited states of heavy quarkonia are determined by the average distances between quarks larger than 0.5  fm , where the linear confining part of the quark - antiquark interaction dominates .",
    "this leads to the emergence of almost linear regge trajectories . on the other hand",
    ", a few lowest states have average sizes smaller than 0.5  fm and fall in the region , where both the coulomb and confining potentials play an important role . as a result ,",
    "the parent regge trajectories exhibit a certain nonlinearity in this region .",
    "the parameters ( slopes , intercepts and nonlinearity ) of both linear and nonlinear regge trajectories were determined .",
    "they were compared to the slopes of the linear regge trajectories of light @xcite and heavy - light @xcite mesons calculated previously .",
    "it was found that the slope of the meson regge trajectory is mainly determined by the mass of the heaviest quark @xmath185 .",
    "a detailed comparison of the calculated heavy quarkonium masses with available experimental data was carried out .",
    "it was found that all data for the states below open flavour production threshold are well reproduced in our model : the difference between predicted and measured masses does not exceed a few mev . for higher excited states , which are above this threshold , most of the well - established conventional states are also well described by our approach , the difference between theory and experiment being somewhat larger , but still within 20 mev .",
    "it was shown that these states fit well to the corresponding regge trajectories .",
    "other states , which have unexpected properties and are therefore believed to have an exotic origin , were also discussed . as it was shown in our previous calculation @xcite ,",
    "most of these states can be described as diquark - antidiquark tetraquarks .",
    "therefore we have a self - consistent picture of the heavy quarkonium spectra .",
    "future experimental studies of the yet unobserved conventional quarkonium states and a clarification of the nature and quantum numbers of the exotic quarkonium - like states will provide a further test of our model .",
