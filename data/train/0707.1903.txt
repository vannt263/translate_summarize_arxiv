    "gluon scattering amplitudes in qcd and supersymmetric gauge theories are notoriously difficult to compute , yet possess remarkably simple hidden structure .",
    "we expect the greatest simplicity in the maximally supersymmetric @xmath0 yang  mills theory , where planar @xmath6-loop amplitudes are believed to satisfy iterative relations  @xcite in @xmath6 .",
    "these relations allow the complete , planar all - loop @xmath7-particle mhv amplitude @xmath8 to be written in an exponential form due to bern , dixon and smirnov  @xcite .",
    "their ansatz for the @xmath9 particle amplitude is @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the t hooft coupling , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the usual four - particle mandelstam invariants , and the infrared divergences are encoded in the prefactors @xmath14 . in dimensional regularization",
    "to @xmath15 the divergences take the form @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of an ir cutoff scale @xmath17 ( required on dimensional grounds ) and two functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 which respectively are related to the @xmath20 appearing in  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) and to a second function called @xmath2 according to @xmath21 the three functions @xmath20 , @xmath2 and @xmath22 are universal ; the same functions appear in the exponential ansatz for any planar @xmath7-particle mhv amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath20 is well - known from another role : it is the cusp anomalous dimension , which also governs the scaling of twist - two operators in the limit of large spin  @xmath23  @xcite , @xmath24 \\right)-s = f(\\lambda ) \\log s + { \\cal o}(s^0).\\ ] ] at weak coupling it has been computed through four loops  @xcite , @xmath25 with @xmath26 ( the quantity in parentheses denotes the current best numerical uncertainty in the last digit ) , while ads / cft calculations  @xcite indicate the strong coupling behavior @xmath27 the recently proposed dressing phase  @xcite for the asymptotic s - matrix  @xcite of the spin chain description of planar @xmath0 yang - mills implies that at finite @xmath28 , @xmath20 satisfies a certain integral equation  @xcite whose solution is compatible with the limits  ( [ eq : limitone ] ) ,  ( [ eq : limittwo ] )  @xcite and moreover predicts that @xmath29 in  ( [ eq : limitone ] ) .    much less is known about the second function @xmath2 which governs the subleading infrared divergence and may be called the `` collinear '' anomalous dimension  @xcite .",
    "perturbative calculations through three loops  @xcite have established that @xmath30 and the purpose of this note is to report a numerical calculation of the four - loop coefficient @xmath31 it is an important outstanding problem to relate @xmath2 to more familiar observables which could perhaps be computed using integrability techniques .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to derive an integral equation satisfied by @xmath2 .",
    "an important step forward was recently taken by alday and maldacena  @xcite , who gave a prescription for computing gluon amplitudes at strong coupling using ads / cft and found perfect agreement with the ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "a consequence of their calculation is the prediction @xmath32 for the leading strong - coupling behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to mention that while @xmath20 is independent of the ir renormalization scale , the same is not true for @xmath2 .",
    "rescaling @xmath17 to @xmath33 sends @xmath2 to @xmath34 .    in section",
    "ii we review our calculational method , which is the same as the one used in  @xcite to calculate @xmath35 to very high accuracy . in section iii we explore the connection between the weak- and strong - coupling behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "first we use the alday - maldacena result  ( [ eq : strongcoupling ] ) , together with the known data  ( [ eq : glimitone ] ) through three loops , to build an interpolating function and make a ` prediction ' for @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably our result  ( [ eq : result ] ) is within @xmath36 of this predicted value .",
    "finally we use all currently available data on @xmath2 to construct a pad approximant which represents our best guess for the function s behavior at finite @xmath28 .",
    "to compute @xmath1 we apply the method of obstructions developed in  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the four - loop iterative structure encoded in  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , which in dimensional regularization takes the form  @xcite    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the ratio of the @xmath6-loop amplitude to the tree amplitude and @xmath39 , @xmath40 are two numbers . according to  @xcite , whose conventions we follow except as noted below , these are related to the four - loop coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath1 in @xmath20 and @xmath2 by @xmath41 the factor of @xmath42 arises here at four loops because the expansion parameter used by  @xcite differs by a factor of @xmath43 from that of  @xcite which we use in  ( [ eq : limitone ] ) and  ( [ eq : glimitone ] ) .",
    "each of the five terms on the left - hand side of  ( [ eq : fone ] ) is separately an extremely complicated function of the ratio @xmath44 with singular behavior starting at @xmath45 .",
    "it is therefore rather remarkable that the five terms conspire to add up to such a simple object involving only two free constants  @xcite .",
    "the leading singularity of @xmath46 on the right - hand side is @xmath47 , so we can determine @xmath48 by reading off the coefficient of the @xmath3 pole on both sides of  ( [ eq : fone ] ) .",
    "-loop four - particle amplitudes in @xmath49 yang - mills theory .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for all necessary details . ]",
    "the idea behind the method of obstructions , explained in detail in  @xcite , is that we do not need to fully compute all of the @xmath38 .",
    "rather , it is sufficient to compute what are in some sense the ` constant pieces ' , since the @xmath50-dependent pieces are guaranteed to cancel each other out on the left - hand side of  ( [ eq : fone ] ) .",
    "this idea is made precise by writing each amplitude as a mellin transform , in the form @xmath51 for some @xmath52 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath40 multiplies @xmath53 in mellin space , so in order to isolate this term it is sufficient to read off just the coefficient of @xmath53 on both sides of  ( [ eq : fone ] ) , throwing away the rest .",
    "we call terms proportional to @xmath54-functions obstructions . the utility of this method benefits significantly from the fact that we can work directly in mellin space , where it is relatively easy to construct explicit formulas for feynman integrals  @xcite .",
    "it was further shown in  @xcite that obstructions obey a product algebra structure , meaning that the obstruction in any product of amplitudes is given by the product of their obstructions .",
    "this statement is obvious in @xmath55-space where it hinges on the simple fact that @xmath53 convolved with itself is again @xmath53 .",
    "consequently we can calculate the obstruction @xmath56 in each @xmath38 separately and then insert those results into the polynomial in  ( [ eq : fone ] ) .",
    "the @xmath57 loop amplitudes we require may be expressed in terms of the 12 scalar feynman diagrams depicted in fig",
    ".  1  @xcite .",
    "the reader may find all necessary details in  @xcite .",
    "our convention is that each loop momentum integral comes with a factor @xmath58 \\int d^d p.\\ ] ] the standard convention includes only the factor in brackets . the additional factor @xmath59 renders all amplitudes dimensionless ( when the appropriate numerator factors are included ) , but it does not alter the form of  ( [ eq : fone ] ) since each term in that equation has a common factor @xmath60 .",
    "the factor of @xmath61 in front here eliminates the need for a factor of @xmath62 in  ( [ eq : amplitudes ] ) below .",
    "we have computed the obstructions in the 12 separate integrals through the first eight orders in @xmath63 and present the results in equation  ( [ eq : obstructions ] ) at the end of the paper .",
    "the calculation was performed using the algorithm explained in  @xcite based on czakon s mb program  @xcite .",
    "numerical integrations were performed using cuba s cuhre algorithm  @xcite , and the digit in parentheses denotes the reported uncertainty in the final digit .",
    "an exact formula for @xmath64 was given in  @xcite , as were the first seven terms in the two- and three - loop amplitudes ( though here we indicate separately the contributions from the two three - loop integrals ) .",
    "no significant effort was spent on attempting to improve the numerical accuracy of the @xmath65 and @xmath47 terms in the individual four - loop integrals because these values play no role in this paper .    to find the full obstruction @xmath66 in the @xmath6-loop amplitude we add together the contributions from the individual integrals according to  @xcite @xmath67 plugging the resulting expressions for @xmath66 into  ( [ eq : fone ] ) in place of @xmath68 and using the relation  ( [ eq : dictionary ] ) leads to the advertised value  ( [ eq : result ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , string theory provides predictions for how @xmath20 and @xmath2 behave at strong coupling .",
    "it is therefore tempting to try to make a connection between the weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "an approximation scheme that has been very successful for @xmath20 is the following .",
    "if @xmath69 orders of the expansion around @xmath70 are known , then one constructs an approximating function @xmath71 as an appropriate solution to the polynomial equation  @xcite @xmath72 where the coefficients @xmath73 are determined by imposing that @xmath74 agree with @xmath20 through @xmath75 .      using the expansion of @xmath20",
    "up to four loops one finds an approximating function @xmath71 that agrees , within a few percent , with the string theory strong coupling prediction and with the bes ansatz  @xcite for all positive values of the coupling .",
    "the success of this approximation scheme makes its application to @xmath2 a natural thing to attempt .",
    "however , since @xmath2 is negative for small @xmath28 but becomes positive at strong coupling , it must have at least one zero for @xmath79 .",
    "clearly , any approximating function of the form  ( [ eq : approx ] ) ( with an appropriate modification because @xmath2 only starts at two loops ) @xmath80 leads to a @xmath81 that can not possibly have a zero for @xmath82 and hence a contradiction .",
    "one way to find a consistent approximating function was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to perform a change of the ir renormalization scale @xmath83 .",
    "then , as discussed above , @xmath84 .",
    "the new function @xmath85 can now be approximated by using  ( [ eq : approx ] ) for any @xmath86 .",
    "consider the approximation  ( [ eq : approx ] ) for @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 this equation depends on four parameters , namely , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "imposing that the approximating function @xmath92 agrees with @xmath93 through @xmath94 determines the three coefficients @xmath90 in terms of @xmath91 . in  @xcite the resulting approximating function",
    "was extrapolated to strong coupling and compared to the string theory prediction for a range of @xmath91 . at the special value @xmath95 ,",
    "for example , the approximation gives @xmath96 compared to the string theory prediction @xmath97 .",
    "here we would like to use the results of alday and maldacena to make a prediction for @xmath1 to compare our result  ( [ eq : result ] ) to . imposing that @xmath98 agrees with the string theory prediction at strong coupling fixes the parameter @xmath99 . then all four parameters @xmath100 and @xmath91 are completely fixed and we can expand the resulting @xmath98 in @xmath28 to @xmath101 to find the predicted value @xmath102 .",
    "remarkably our result  ( [ eq : result ] ) is only @xmath36 away from this value .",
    "we interpret this as good evidence for the string theory strong coupling prediction of alday and maldacena  @xcite .",
    "finally we present also a more conventional pad approximant for @xmath2 based upon all currently available data .",
    "here we follow the approach described in  @xcite where a @xmath103 $ ] pad approximant in terms of the auxiliary variable @xmath104 was considered for @xmath20 .",
    "specifically we consider the ansatz @xmath105 with four parameters @xmath106 .",
    "the choice @xmath107 was motivated by evidence that @xmath20 should have a branch point at @xmath108 .",
    "it seems reasonable to guess that the same might be true for @xmath2 , though we have no direct evidence for this guess .",
    "the four parameters in  ( [ eq : padeansatz ] ) can be uniquely determined by fitting to all available data  the perturbative expansion through four loops as well as the strong - coupling limit  ( [ eq : strongcoupling ] ) .",
    "the resulting approximant , displayed in fig .  2 , may be considered our best candidate picture of @xmath2 at the moment .",
    "note that it is minimal in the sense that @xmath110 was designed to have a single zero along the positive real axis , whereas the true @xmath2 could potentially have any odd number of zeros .",
    "curiously , the zero lies very close to @xmath111 , although it is impossible to conclude based on the limited available data whether or not this is just a coincidence .",
    "we have benefited from discussions with z.  bern , l.  dixon and j.  maldacena .",
