    "approximately 6070% of disk galaxies in the local universe have stellar bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a wide variety of observational evidence indicates that many bars are vertically thickened in their inner regions , appearing as `` boxy '' or `` peanut - shaped '' ( b / p ) bulges when seen edge - on ; this includes our own galaxy , whose bulge is mostly if not entirely part of its bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "edge - on galaxies with b / p bulges show gas and stellar kinematics consistent with a rotating bar in the disk plane @xcite ; moderately inclined barred galaxies show isophotes consistent with the projection of b / p bulges within the bars @xcite ; and face - on barred galaxies show kinematic and morphological signatures of b / p bulges as well @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest that failing to account for the presence of b / p bulges can lead to significantly overestimating the luminosities and masses of `` classical '' ( spheroidal ) bulges in disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "this can potentially bias our understanding of how bulges are related to other galaxy properties , including the key correlations between supermassive black holes and bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the formation of b / p bulges is thus an important part of understanding and constraining models of galaxy ( and black hole ) evolution .",
    "the most frequently invoked mechanism for forming these structures is the buckling instability of the bar , a brief but violent vertical instability which occurs ( in simulations ) not long after the bar forms . in simulations ,",
    "the formation of the bar increases the radial velocity dispersion of stars in the disk ; this leads to a highly anisotropic velocity dispersion tensor and the vertical destabilization of the bar @xcite . following a phase of asymmetric vertical buckling",
    ", the inner part of the bar settles into the more vertically symmetric form of a b / p bulge .    despite over twenty years of simulations which show buckling ,",
    "no observed buckling has ( yet ) been reported for real galaxies , a situation called `` puzzling '' in the review of @xcite .",
    "an alternative model proposes that b / p bulges form by the trapping of single orbits into vertical resonances , leading to more gradual , vertically _",
    "symmetric _ growth @xcite . in some simulations ,",
    "the presence of gas weakens or prevents buckling , while still allowing symmetric bar thickening @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not clear that real galaxies must suffer the buckling instability .",
    "there are also no clear , strong differences due to the different formation mechanisms in the resulting end - stage b / p bulges , making it difficult to determine from observations of existing b / p bulges how they were formed .    in this letter",
    ", we present evidence for ongoing buckling in the bars of two local spiral galaxies ( ngc  3227 and ngc  4569 ) , thus demonstrating that buckling of bars definitely occurs in real galaxies .",
    "we also argue that the observed fraction of buckling bars at @xmath2 is at least broadly consistent with most ( or even all ) b / p bulges being the result of buckling , if the buckling phase lasts @xmath31 gyr  as is predicted by @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations have long predicted that bars should buckle some time after they form . in this letter , we use four such simulations , three of which were previously analyzed in @xcite . for consistency , we use a similar naming scheme : `` simulation a  c '' in this paper correspond to `` runs a  c '' in erwin & debattista . these three simulations",
    "are described in more detail in erwin & debattista and ( for simulations b and c ) in @xcite ; they included 300,000500,000 stellar particles in the disk and softening lengths of 60  pc ( simulation a ) or 0.05 natural units ( b and c ) .",
    "simulation d is almost identical to model t2 of @xcite .",
    "it is comprised of thin+thick disks inside a dark matter halo , with 3 million stellar particles and a softening length of 50  pc .",
    "the two disks have roughly the same radial velocity dispersion profile , but the thin disk has half the height of the thick disk ( versus a height ratio of one - fourth for model t2 ) ; see debattista et al .  for further details .",
    "@xcite compared @xmath0-body simulations and real barred galaxies to show that it was possible to identify b / p bulges in bars even at inclinations as low as @xmath4 .",
    "( the advantage of intermediate inclinations  e.g. , @xmath5  over more edge - on orientations is that the bar as a whole is readily identifiable and measurable , regardless of whether its interior is vertically thick or not . )",
    "the key isophotal signatures are a broad , often boxy inner zone ( corresponding to the vertically thick , b / p part of the bar ) and thinner `` spurs '' extending beyond ( corresponding to the vertically thin outer parts of the bar ) ; the spurs are usually offset from the major axis of the inner zone , so that the projected bar has 180 rotational symmetry on the sky ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sims - pre - during - and - post]c , [ fig : n3227-n4569-vs - sim]a ) .",
    "when simulations _ in the buckling phase _ are viewed at the same intermediate inclinations , however , the projected bar shows _ trapezoidal _ inner isophotes ( corresponding to the main buckling region ) and outer spurs which are offset in the _ same _ direction relative to the bar s observed major axis , forming a continuation of the trapezoid s long side ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sims - pre - during - and - post]b , d  f , [ fig : n3227-n4569-vs - sim]d ) .",
    "this morphology clearly differs from the symmetric - box plus counter - offset spurs seen in post - buckling bars with their symmetric b / p bulges .",
    "as part of a survey of local barred galaxies with favorable orientations for detecting and measuring projected b / p bulges ( erwin & debattista , in prep ) , we have found two examples of bars with morphologies indicating that they are currently in the buckling phase : ngc  3227 and ngc  4569 ( m90 ) . in both galaxies ,",
    "the inner or middle region of the bar shows quasi - trapezoidal isophotes ( most clearly in ngc  4569 ) , while the outer - bar spurs are offset in the same direction and connect to the long side of the trapezoid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n3227-n4569-vs - sim]e , f ) .",
    "this morphology is a good match to the general appearance of projected @xmath0-body bars in the buckling phase .",
    "although both galaxies are currently experiencing star formation within their bars , comparison of their near - infrared morphologies with published h@xmath6 images allows us to rule out the possibility that recent star formation is responsible for the overall morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ed - sf ] ) .",
    "the best case is probably ngc  4569 , which shows a symmetric inner trapezoid and clear offset spurs ; it differs from the simulations ( figure  [ fig : sims - pre - during - and - post ] ) in having a relatively compact buckling region , with a half - length @xmath7 1.9 kpc ( measured along its long axis ) , quite small relative to the bar as a whole ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 half - length of the bar ) .",
    "the trapezoidal region in ngc  3227 is much larger ( @xmath10 kpc , @xmath11 ) , with some resemblance to simulation  b ( figure  [ fig : sims - pre - during - and - post]e ) ; the interior of the trapezoid appears less symmetric , which may be partly due to emission from recent star formation ( figure  [ fig : ed - sf ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , the outer isophotes show the characteristic offset - spurs pattern .",
    "the relative sizes of the buckling regions in these two galaxies fall near the lower and upper limits for the range of _ symmetric _ b / p bulge sizes seen in local barred galaxies : @xmath120.58 , with a mean of 0.38 @xcite .",
    "the buckling phase in our simulations is also accompanied by asymmetries in the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath13 , measured along the major axis of the bar . for simulated bars before and after the buckling phase , the dispersion is roughly symmetric about the center : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is measured along the bar major axis . during the buckling phase , however , the dispersion becomes strongly _",
    "asymmetric_. to quantify this , we computed a mean asymmetry measure : @xmath16 where the dispersion is measured in @xmath0 radial bins @xmath17 on either side of the galaxy center , out to a maximum distance @xmath18 .",
    "symmetric dispersion profiles have values of @xmath19 close to 0 , while more asymmetric profiles have larger values .    to determine @xmath19 for a simulation , we first matched the orientation of ngc  4569 ( the only one of the two galaxies with sufficiently extended stellar kinematics ) by rotating the simulation so that the bar was @xmath20pa = 26 away from the line of nodes , and then inclining it by @xmath21 about the line of nodes .",
    "we measured velocity dispersions as the square root of the variance of particle line - of - sight velocities , using a slit width of 0.2 and evenly spaced bins of radial size 0.05 ( simulation units ) along the major axis of the projected simulation . for observational comparison ,",
    "we used published velocity dispersion data for ngc  4569 and ten barred galaxies with known ( symmetric ) b / p bulges which had inclinations and bar orientations similar to the two buckling - bar galaxies ; these galaxies and the sources of kinematic data are listed in table  [ tab : kinematics ] . for all but two of the symmetric - b /",
    "p galaxies , we use long - slit data , if the position angle of the slit was within 30 of the bar major axis . for ngc  3627 and ngc  4293 , we extracted pseudo - long - slit measurements along the bar major axes from published integral - field - unit ( ifu ) velocity - dispersion data @xcite . finally , we derived velocity - dispersion measurements for ngc  4569 from the ifu data of @xcite .",
    "[ fig : kinematics]b shows the time evolution of @xmath22 in simulation c , with @xmath23 equal to the size of the boxy / trapezoidal region once it has formed ( @xmath24 in simulation units ) . the onset of buckling at @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics]a ) is accompanied by rapid growth in the dispersion asymmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics]b ) , which gradually returns to near symmetry ( @xmath26 ) as the inner part of the post - buckled bar settles into a mature b / p bulge . fig .",
    "[ fig : kinematics]c shows _ radial _ trends in @xmath27 for ngc  4569 and the ten symmetric - b / p galaxies , and also for representative times from simulation c. galaxies with symmetric b / p bulges ( gray symbols ) show minimal asymmetry ( in almost all cases @xmath26 ) , especially for larger @xmath23 , as do the pre- and post - buckling simulation profiles .",
    "for ngc  4569 ( red symbols ) , however , the asymmetry _ increases _ as @xmath23 approaches the size of the buckling region  just as in the simulation during the buckling phase ( blue symbols ) .",
    "we are currently studying a sample of local barred galaxies in order to identify and measure b / p bulges ( erwin & debattista , in prep ) .",
    "this sample is diameter- and distance - limited ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 mpc , to ensure adequate resolution of bar interiors ) and includes a total of 84 barred s0sd galaxies which have inclinations and orientations that maximize the detectability of b / p bulges ( @xmath3070 , deprojected @xmath20pa between bar and disk major axis @xmath31 ) .",
    "all galaxies were examined ( using near - ir images ) for the morphology of b / p bulges @xcite .",
    "we find b / p bulges to be extremely common in high - stellar - mass galaxies : they are present in @xmath32% of the 44 barred disks with @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the two buckling - bar galaxies were identified as part of this sample , and are in the high - stellar - mass ( @xmath35 ) subsample .",
    "the frequency of observed buckling in local , high - mass barred galaxies is thus @xmath36% .",
    "is this frequency high or low ? put another way , is it consistent with the possibility that many  or even _ all _ ",
    "b / p bulges are the result of the buckling instability ?    to test this hypothesis , we adopted a toy galaxy - evolution model in which the fraction of disk galaxies with visible bars is a linear function of redshift , equal to @xmath37 at @xmath2 and decreasing to 0 at redshift @xmath38 ; we based this on the observed evolution of bar fraction with redshift in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and recent cosmologically - motivated simulations of bar formation and growth @xcite .",
    "( we note that the simulated galaxies in kraljic et al .",
    "all have @xmath39 , consistent with the local high - mass subsample we are considering , and that the high - redshift observational studies have similar lower limits on @xmath40 . ) following the pattern observed in @xmath0-body simulations , we assumed that there is a delay between bar formation and buckling , equal to @xmath41 gyr , followed by a visible buckling phase lasting @xmath42 gyr , and ending with a permanently b / p - hosting bar .",
    "we performed a markov chain monte carlo analysis of this model , computing the likelihood as the product of individual binomial likelihoods for the @xmath2 fraction of galaxies with bars @xmath43 , the fraction of bars with b / p bulges @xmath44 , and the fraction of bars currently buckling @xmath45 , compared with the observed counts in our local high - mass subsample ( erwin & debattista , in prep . ) ; we assumed a flat prior for @xmath46 and flat priors for values @xmath47 for the other parameters .",
    "we used the ` emcee ` ensemble sampler code of @xcite , with 50 separate chains and 500 steps per chain , discarding the first 150 steps in each chain .",
    "after marginalizing over @xmath37 and @xmath38 as nuisance parameters , we find @xmath48 gyr and @xmath49 gyr ( medians and 68% confidence intervals ) .",
    "these are in good agreement with values from @xmath0-body simulations , which typically find @xmath502 gyr and @xmath511 gyr @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the observed frequency of buckling bars at @xmath2 is consistent with the predictions of @xmath0-body simulations , and that the buckling instability could plausibly account for most if not all instances of b / p bulges in massive disk galaxies in the local universe .",
    "( we note , however , that given the small numbers involved , our observations do not rule out the possibility that some of b / p bulges could be the result of alternate , symmetric growth mechanisms . ) direct confirmation of this would involve imaging of bars in the buckling phase at higher redshifts .",
    "our simple model predicts a maximum buckling fraction of @xmath52 at @xmath53 ; near - ir detection of buckling in large bars ( @xmath54 kpc ) at this redshift is feasible with the upcoming _ james webb space telescope_.    we are pleased to thank guillermo blanc , juan corts , eric emsellem , and jsus falcn - barroso for generously making their kinematic data available ; we also thank the referee ( juntai shen ) , jerry sellwood , roberto saglia , jairo mndez - abreu , and david trinkle for useful comments on earlier drafts .",
