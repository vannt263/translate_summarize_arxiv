    "it has long been recognized that the peculiar @xmath12-axis transport properties @xcite of the high-@xmath11 cuprates are strong manifestations of the unusual electronic state in these materials .",
    "@xcite in particular , the following two features have been considered to be most unusual : ( i ) the magnitude of the @xmath12-axis resistivity @xmath1 is orders of magnitude larger than that expected from band calculations , @xcite leading to a huge resistivity anisotropy where @xmath1 is up to 10@xmath13 times larger @xcite than the in - plane resistivity @xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) the temperature dependence of @xmath1 is in most cases semiconducting or insulating ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , while that of @xmath0 is metallic ( @xmath15 ) ; such a contrasting behavior @xcite is not expected in ordinary anisotropic metal . @xcite",
    "the feature ( i ) indicates that the strong correlations in the cuprate materials give rise to some unconventional mechanism which renormalizes the @xmath12-axis transfer - matrix element to a value much smaller than what is expected for an uncorrelated system .",
    "this renormalization of the @xmath12-axis transfer - matrix element is usually called  charge confinement \" .",
    "there have been many theoretical proposals to explain the charge confinement in the cuprates , but it is fair to say that the confinement mechanism is not yet understood on the fundamental level . since many of the theoretical models for the charge confinement , such as the resonating - valence - bond theories @xcite or self - organized stripe theories , @xcite are closely tied to the mechanism of the high-@xmath11 superconductivity , it remains to be important to study the @xmath12-axis transport in the cuprates .",
    "the feature ( ii ) is now better understood than the feature ( i ) , both experimentally and theoretically , though the understanding is still far from complete . to appreciate the current understanding of the feature ( ii ) ,",
    "it should first be recognized @xcite that the @xmath12-axis transport in the normal - state of the cuprates is essentially an incoherent tunneling process ; this fact gives rise to the intrinsic josephson effect @xcite as well as the josephson - plasma resonance @xcite in the superconducting state .",
    "it should at the same time be noted that the tunneling conductance for ordinary metal - insulator - metal junctions should be _ independent _ of temperature , according to the fermi golden rule ; this means that the  semiconducting \" behavior of @xmath16 does _ not _ automatically arise from the tunneling nature of the @xmath12-axis transport .",
    "( in this sense , the expression  semiconducting behavior \" , which implies that the transport is essentially an activation process over a gap , is inappropriate , though this expression is often naively used in this context . ) thus , there must be some unconventional mechanisms which cause the peculiar  insulating \" temperature dependence of @xmath1 in the cuprates .",
    "experimentally , there seem to be two additive mechanisms that are both responsible for the  insulating \" @xmath16 .",
    "the first is the charge - confinement mechanism which appears to become increasingly more effective with lowering temperature ; this causes the tunneling matrix element to be reduced and keeps @xmath1 increasing with decreasing @xmath17 .",
    "this point was most clearly demonstrated @xcite by the low - temperature normal - state resistivity measurement of bi@xmath2sr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( bslco ) under 60 t , which showed that @xmath1 of bi-2201 keeps increasing even down to 0.6 k. the more recently recognized mechanism is the effect of the pseudogap @xcite which causes destruction of the fermi surface starting from the ( @xmath18 , 0 ) , ( 0 , @xmath18 ) points , as has been demonstrated by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements @xcite ; this causes the available density of states ( dos ) for tunneling to be reduced , and @xmath1 gets steeply increased as the pseudogap develops .",
    "note that the @xmath12-axis matrix element of the cuprates has a particular @xmath19-dependence @xcite ( @xmath19 is the in - plane wave vector of the conduction electrons ) that tends to amplify the contribution of the electrons on these gapped portion of the fermi surface , and this @xmath19-dependence of the matrix element causes @xmath1 to be very sensitive to the opening of the pseudogap .",
    "@xcite recent tunneling - spectroscopic studies @xcite of the intrinsic junctions in bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath20 ( bi-2212 ) have made strong cases for the interpretation that the steep upturn in @xmath16 below the pseudogap temperature @xmath21 is largely due to this second mechanism .",
    "it is expected that these two independent mechanisms , confinement and pseudogap , together cause the rather complicated ,  insulating \" @xmath16 behavior in the cuprates , though their relative roles in determining the actual temperature dependence is not clarified yet .",
    "given the above - mentioned recent understanding of the @xmath12-axis transport , it would be instructive to see how the two mechanisms ( confinement and pseudogap ) are actually working in a single system .",
    "for such a purpose , it is useful to elucidate the evolution of the behavior of @xmath16 , as well as the anisotropy ratio @xmath22 , over a wide range of hole doping , because @xmath21 is known to decreases with increasing doping . in the past",
    ", there were many studies of the anisotropic resistivities in la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath23 ( lsco ) , @xcite yba@xmath2cu@xmath24o@xmath25 ( ybco ) , @xcite bi-2212 , @xcite and bslco , @xcite but none of them cover a wide enough doping range from underdoped insulators to overdoped superconductors to yield a coherent picture .",
    "very recently , komiya _",
    "measured @xcite the anisotropic resistivity of high - quality lsco single crystals for @xmath6 = 0.01  0.10 and found that in this system the effect of pseudogap is _ not _ apparent ( i.e. , the additional mechanism to cause the insulating @xmath16 is absent ) , probably because of the unique fermi surface topology @xcite of lsco .",
    "therefore , it is useful to study another cuprate system in which one can change the hole doping over a really wide range",
    ". obviously , bslco is an ideal candidate , because we have demonstrated @xcite that the hole doping can be varied ( by changing the la concentration ) from heavily - underdoped insulator to overdoped superconductor ; moreover , arpes measurements have found @xcite that the fermi surface topology and the pseudogap structure of bslco are very similar to those of bi-2212 .",
    "we can thus expect that it may be possible to substantiate the effects of charge confinement and the pseudogap on the @xmath12-axis transport by tracing its evolution with the hole doping in bslco .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide high - quality data , obtained from well - controlled experiments , on the evolution of the temperature dependences of @xmath1 and @xmath22 of bslco for a wide range of doping , which showcases the complicated origin of the unusual @xmath12-axis transport in the cuprates .",
    "our data exemplifies that there are three different mechanisms that govern the behavior of the anisotropy ratio @xmath22 : charge confinement , pseudogap , and localization .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependence of @xmath1 of our underdoped samples makes a good case for the two different origins of the insulating behavior below @xmath21 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : details of our crystal - growth technique to produce the high - quality bslco single crystals , as well as the details of our measurement technique , are presented in section ii .",
    "section iii presents our data for @xmath26 , @xmath16 , and @xmath9 , putting emphasis on how they evolve with changing hole doping .",
    "the implication of the systematics of our observation is discussed in section iv , and section v summarizes our findings .",
    "the bi@xmath2sr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 system is a bi - based single - layer cuprate where the hole doping is controlled by replacing sr with la . until a few years ago",
    ", this material had been considered to be a particularly  dirty \" system among the cuprates , because the in - plane resistivity of even the best crystal at those times showed the residual resistivities of around 70 @xmath27 cm ( refs . ) and the hall coefficient @xmath28 displayed only a weak temperature dependence , @xcite both of which are characteristic of dirty cuprate samples .    in 1999 ,",
    "ando and murayama demonstrated @xcite that it is possible to grow high - quality single crystals of bslco that show much smaller residual resistivity and a strongly temperature - dependent @xmath28 , which conform to the  standard \" behavior of cuprates .",
    "also , though the bslco system was believed to possess the lowest optimum @xmath11 among the well - studied cuprate systems , we have demonstrated @xcite that the optimum @xmath11 of this system can be raised to 38 k , which is almost equal to the optimum @xmath11 of lsco .    in bslco , larger la concentration @xmath6 corresponds to smaller hole doping per cu , @xmath8 , and the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , as well as the phase diagram of @xmath11 vs @xmath8 , has been sorted out @xcite ; it was found that optimum doping occurs at @xmath29 0.16 ( which is achieved with @xmath30 0.4 ) , but the superconductivity disappears at @xmath29 0.10 ( @xmath30 0.8 ) upon underdoping .",
    "low - temperature normal - state resistivity measurement of this system using 60-t pulsed magnetic field found @xcite that the metal - to - insulator crossover occurs at @xmath29 1/8 , below which @xmath26 shows a peculiar @xmath31 divergence .",
    "single crystals of bi@xmath2sr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 are grown by the floating - zone ( fz ) technique for a wide range of la concentration ( 0.23 @xmath32 1.02 ) . before the fz operation , we first prepare polycrystalline rods of bslco . raw powders of bi@xmath33o@xmath24 , srco@xmath24 , la@xmath33o@xmath24 , and cuo , with purities of 99.9% or higher , are dried , weighed , mixed into the nominal molar ratio of the target composition , and well ground in an agate mortar ; they are then calcined at 750 ",
    "850@xmath34c for 20 hours to form the bslco phase .",
    "the resulting powders are reground and calcined again , and this process is repeated twice .",
    "the x - ray diffraction analysis reveals that the powders become 100%-pure bslco phase after the third calcination .",
    "the resulting bslco powders are isostatically pressed into a rod shape ( @xmath35 5 mm@xmath36 @xmath37 100 mm ) and finally sintered at 850@xmath34c for 20 hours , to form a rigid polycrystalline feed rod to be used for the fz operation .",
    "single - crystal growth is carried out using an infrared image furnace ( nec machinery sc k-15hd ) with two halogen lamps and double ellipsoidal mirrors .",
    "we grow bslco crystals with a  simple \" fz technique , which means that we do not use any solvent to reduce the temperature of the molten zone .",
    "one important technique we use is what we call  fast scan \" , with which we quickly melt and quench the whole feed rod using the fz furnace with the feed speed of 30 mm / h . this process is necessary for making the feed rod dense , which is important for avoiding the emergence of bubbles during the crystal growth ; actually , the rod becomes appreciably thinner than the as - sintered rod after the fast scan ( it becomes roughly 3 mm@xmath36 ) .",
    "the  scanned \" rod is then remounted to the fz furnace and is used for the actual crystal growth .",
    "the growth rate is kept constant at 0.5 mm / h , which is two times slower than the growth rate for lsco .",
    "@xcite another important technique we use during the growth is what we call  necking \" ; since many independent domains start to crystallize at the initial stage of the growth , after roughly 1 cm of the rod is grown , the diameter of the molten zone is gradually reduced to approximately 2 mm@xmath36 , which causes fewer domains to remain in the crystal .",
    "the molten zone is then gradually fattened , which leads to the growth of the fewer domains in the resulting rod .",
    "after a few times of the necking , when the growth is successful , there remains only one domain and the whole chunk becomes a large single - domain crystal .",
    "the space around the molten zone is filled with 1 atm of flowing oxygen during the growth of underdoped crystals , while for the growth of overdoped crystals the space is filled with 1 atm of flowing air .",
    "the size of the single - domain crystals that can be obtained from the grown rod is typically 20 @xmath37 3 mm@xmath38 .",
    ".actual composition of the obtained crystals for each nominal ( starting ) la concentration .",
    "the molar ratios of the cations are determined by icp - aes and are shown with the cu value fixed to 1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the crystals are cut into dimensions of typically 2 @xmath37 1 @xmath37 0.05 mm@xmath39 for the @xmath0 measurements and 1 @xmath37 1 @xmath37 0.05 mm@xmath39 for the @xmath40 measurements .",
    "accurate determination of the crystal thickness is done by measuring the weight with 0.1 @xmath41 g resolution and converting it into volume using the nominal density for each composition .",
    "we employ the straightforward four - terminal method to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 : for the @xmath0 measurements , the current contacts are painted to cover two opposing side faces of the platelet - shaped crystals to ensure a uniform current flow and the voltage contacts are painted on the two remaining side faces of the crystals . for the @xmath40 measurements ,",
    "two current contacts are painted to almost completely cover the opposing @xmath42 faces of the crystal and two voltage contacts are placed in the small window reserved in the center of the current contacts . in both cases , the contact pads are tactfully hand - drawn with gold paint , followed by a heat treatment at 400@xmath43c for 30 minutes in the air , which makes the gold particles to well adhere to the sample surface . after this heat - treatment to cure the gold contact pads , the samples are annealed at higher temperatures for longer time to control the oxygen concentration ; samples with @xmath6 larger than 0.3 are annealed in flowing air at 650@xmath34c for 48 hours , while those with @xmath44 are annealed in flowing oxygen at 400@xmath34c for 60 hours . in both cases , the crystals are annealed together with a sufficient amount of bslco powders of the same composition , and they are quenched to room temperature at the end of the annealing .",
    "finally , gold lead wires are attached to the contact pads using silver epoxy , which is cured at relatively low temperature , 130@xmath43c .",
    "the contact resistance we achieve with this technique is less than 1 @xmath45 .",
    "we note that the above annealing conditions are chosen to minimize the superconducting transition width @xmath46 of our crystals ; in all the superconducting samples , @xmath46 in @xmath16 data is around 2 k after the above annealing .     and ( b ) @xmath1 of the bslco crystals with @xmath6 = 0.66 ( @xmath8 = 0.12 ) ; quenched samples ( solid lines ) and slowly - cooled samples ( dotted lines ) show non - negligible difference , even though the annealing conditions are the same.,width=302 ]    before finishing the description of our sample preparation technique",
    ", we would like to emphasize the importance of the quenching at the end of the high - temperature annealing .",
    "figure 1 shows the data of @xmath26 and @xmath16 of our bslco crystals with @xmath6 = 0.66 , for both quenched and slowly - cooled samples .",
    "although both sets of the samples are annealed at 650@xmath34c for 48 hours , the data show non - negligible differences ; the difference in the @xmath26 are comparatively small ( the magnitude of @xmath0 of quenched sample is 10% larger than that of slowly - cooled sample ) , but the difference in @xmath47 is significant , differing by about 50% . also , @xmath48 is about 2 k for the quenched samples , while it is about 6 k for the slowly - cooled sample .",
    "those differences are consistent with the interpretation that the slow cooling causes the oxygen concentration in the samples to be inhomogeneous and there are more oxygen near the surface of the slowly - cooled samples ; remember that the equilibrium oxygen concentration of bi-2201 during the annealing is dependent on both the temperature and the oxygen partial pressure , and the equilibrium concentration becomes higher as the temperature is lowered .",
    "thus , to obtain uniformly oxygenated samples and reproducible data , quenching is indispensable .    in this work ,",
    "we measure @xmath0 and @xmath40 on more than 20 samples for each la concentration to check for the reproducibility ; the variation in the absolute magnitude of the resistivity of the quenched sample is less than @xmath4910% , which is consistent with the size of the errors due to uncertainties in the geometrical factors .",
    "we have previously determined the actual hole concentration per cu , @xmath8 , for various la concentrations @xmath6 , and have obtained an empirical relation .",
    "@xcite in this paper we use this empirical relation to convert @xmath6 into @xmath8 , which are listed in table i. hereafter we mostly use the @xmath8 value in referring to the samples , because @xmath8 is much more intuitively understandable than @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite we assert this difference is not intrinsic but is rather due to disorder , because the room - temperature sheet resistance per cuo@xmath33 plane of our bslco at @xmath8 = 0.03 is 110 k@xmath45 , while that of lsco at @xmath6 = 0.03 ( ref . )",
    "is only 60 k@xmath45 ; this indicates that a significant disorder is present in the heavily - underdoped bslco samples . on the other hand ,",
    "the residual resistivity at optimum - doping ( @xmath8 = 0.16 ) is only 20 @xmath27 cm , indicating that the electron transport can be quite clean in this system ; since we find that the crystals are morphologically very clean for both @xmath8 = 0.03 and 0.16 , the source of the electronic disorder is apparently not any crystalline defects but is likely to be the local disordering potentials due to the la dopants .",
    "it is useful to note that the barely superconducting sample , @xmath8 = 0.10 , shows @xmath0 value of @xmath530.7 m@xmath45 cm just above @xmath11 ; this value corresponds to the sheet resistance per cuo@xmath33 plane of 5.8 k@xmath45 , which is very close to the quantum sheet resistance @xmath54 (= 6.45 k@xmath45 ) .",

    "6 is that the @xmath16 data tend to deviate downwardly from the @xmath64 ( @xmath69 1 ) dependence at lower temperatures in underdoped samples ; moreover , the characteristic temperature for this deviation , @xmath68 , systematically moves to higher temperature with decreasing @xmath8 . in the light of the current understanding of the @xmath12-axis transport phenomena in cuprates ,",
    "it is most reasonable to interpret this deviation to come from a saturation of the rapid pseudogap opening , and the more slower increase in @xmath1 below @xmath68 is likely to be due to the temperature dependence in the strength of the confinement .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of @xmath1 as revealed in the log - log plot appears to reflect the fact that the  insulating \" behavior is caused by the two phenomena , the pseudogap and the confinement .",
    "this is new information which the systematics of our data allows us to infer .",
    "( the low - temperature data of the non - superconducting samples ( @xmath8 = 0.03 and 0.07 ) , which show steeper divergence below @xmath68 compared to the superconducting samples , are probably affected by the additional effect of localization . )    we note that the effect of superconducting fluctuations , which cause additional pseudo - gapping near @xmath11,@xcite appears to be inconsequential in the overall behavior of the underdoped samples shown in fig . 6 , and the evolution of @xmath68 with @xmath8 is unrelated to @xmath11 .",
    "this is probably because the additional reduction in the dos near @xmath11 due to superconducting fluctuations is relatively small in underdoped samples , which can be inferred by the small size of the magnetoresistance@xcite observed in underdoped samples .",
    "it is useful to mention that several empirical temperature dependences have been proposed to describe the @xmath16 data of cuprates .",
    "in particular , @xmath70 has been reported to fit the @xmath16 data of bi-2212 very well , @xcite while @xmath71 has been reported to fit the @xmath16 data of bslco .",
    "@xcite we have tried to fit our data using these formulae , and found that the latter formula fits well to the data for @xmath8 = 0.16 and 0.18 ; however , neither of them fits well to the data for underdoped samples , which is apparently due to the existence of ",

    "the @xmath22 data of fig .",
    "4 using a linear scale , which makes it easier to infer the quantitative change of the anisotropy with doping . in fig . 8 , one can see that at high temperatures the @xmath22 value drops rapidly with increasing @xmath8 for @xmath72 , but this rapid change tends to saturate in highly doped samples ( @xmath73 ) ; this situation can be understood more graphically by plotting the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath1/@xmath0 at 200 k and 300 k , as is shown in fig .",
    "9 . it can be seen in fig . 9",
    "that at 200 k the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath22 for high doping ( @xmath73 ) is weak , while the @xmath22 value steeply increases with decreasing @xmath8 for lower doping ( @xmath74 ) , except for @xmath8 = 0.03 .",
    "it is most likely that the weak @xmath8 dependence at high doping reflects the change in the strength of the charge confinement , while the steep increase in the underdoped samples reflects the enhancement of the anisotropy due to the pseudogap .",
    "in fact , the @xmath67 value we determined in fig .",
    "6 is near 200 k for @xmath8 = 0.12 .",
    "therefore , the peculiar hole - doping dependence of the anisotropy is understood to be a combined result of the confinement and the pseudogap .",

    ", one notices that for non - superconducting concentrations ( @xmath8 = 0.03 and 0.07 ) there is a peak in the temperature dependence of @xmath22 ( at 50 and 100 k , respectively ) , and below the peak temperature the anisotropy is diminished .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 for @xmath8 = 0.03 decreases dramatically with decreasing @xmath17 , suggesting that the system is heading towards an anisotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) state for @xmath75 .",
    "such diminishment of @xmath22 has also been observed in insulating samples of bi-2212 ( ref . ) and lsco ( ref . ) , and has been discussed to be due to localization of carriers .",
    "in fact , when the carriers are completely localized and becomes immobile in _ any _ direction , it is natural to see the system as a ",

    "the dotted lines are fits to the expected temperature dependence for the 3d vrh , @xmath77 $ ] . since the 3d - vrh formula describes the temperature dependences of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 very well , one can conclude that the charge transport along _ all _ directions is governed by the _",

    "the fits give @xmath78 values of @xmath79 k and @xmath80 k for @xmath26 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "these values are in the same range as the @xmath81 values obtained for flux - grown lsco crystals in the lightly - doped regime , @xcite but the source of its anisotropy is not clear at this stage .",
    "systematic measurements of the @xmath12-axis resistivity @xmath1 and the resistivity anisotropy ratio @xmath22 of bslco for a wide doping range showcase that the anisotropy is determined by three mechanisms : charge confinement , pseudogap , and localization . at high temperature and in highly doped samples , the charge confinement is the sole determining factor , and thus one can measure the intrinsic strength of the charge confinement in this corner of the phase diagram ; our data indicate that without the effect of the pseudogap the @xmath22 value is order of 10@xmath82 for bslco . at low temperature and in low doped samples ,",
    "the localization governs the charge transport and the @xmath22 ratio is diminished . in underdoped superconducting samples ,",
    "the pseudogap significantly enhances the @xmath22 value with decreasing temperature , causing @xmath22 to reach @xmath5310@xmath83 .",
    "close examination of the temperature dependence of @xmath1 of underdoped samples finds that below @xmath21 there are two distinct temperature regions where the divergence of @xmath1 appears to be governed by different mechanisms ; the data suggest that the development of the pseudogap leads to a @xmath64 dependence of @xmath1 with @xmath69 1 below @xmath21 , while at lower temperature @xmath1 shows a weaker temperature dependence where we argue that the charge confinement dictates the @xmath17 dependence .",
    "since the effect of the pseudogap is apparently lacking in the anisotropic behavior of lsco , @xcite the bslco system offers a complementary testing ground to study the source of the peculiar @xmath12-axis transport in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "the bslco samples used in ref . were taken from the same batch as the samples used in the present study , but they were annealed with different conditions ; this caused the @xmath11 values for the same composition to be lower in the samples of ref . .",
