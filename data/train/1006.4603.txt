    "the topic of _ the quark - gluon medium _ is so widely spread nowadays that it deserves a series of monographs , even in spite of still being in the actively developing stage , and can not be fully covered within a single review paper .",
    "that is why we mostly concentrate here on general ideas about the evolution of the quark - gluon medium in high energy heavy ion collisions and on those properties of the medium which are revealed by the energy losses of partons moving in it .",
    "they are described by the chromodynamics of the quark - gluon medium which is of the main topic of this review .",
    "nevertheless , it would be too `` ostrich - like '' behavior not to mention the nearby problems and approaches .",
    "therefore we include in the present review brief discussions of some of them .",
    "in particular , the analogies and differences between electrodynamical and chromodynamical processes are described .",
    "the extremely popular hydrodynamical approach has been widely discussed in many review papers .",
    "that is why we decided to give just a short description of it here referring to the corresponding literature . the anti de - sitter / quantum chromodynamics ( ads / qcd ) correspondence is touched upon only slightly .",
    "lattice results are mentioned very briefly too .",
    "they are mostly applicable to static properties of hadrons and are of interest to us here in what concerns phase transitions .",
    "the very interesting ideas about possible local cp violation in heavy ion collisions are briefly mentioned but not discussed in detail .",
    "the relation of the little bang in heavy ion collisions to the big bang in cosmology is another topic of interest .",
    "however , it is out of the scope of our survey . a short overview of experimental results is presented in section 2 . however , in subsequent sections of this review only those experimental papers are cited which are discussed in more details in connection with theoretical considerations .",
    "we apologize to those whose work could not be completely reviewed due to the limited size of this paper .",
    "the internal structure and interactions of particles and nuclei are the main goal of studies at accelerators . according to present knowledge strong interactions",
    "are described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it describes quarks and gluons as elementary objects ( partons ) responsible for the interaction .    at low energies",
    "the partons are confined inside strongly interacting particles ( hadrons ) and define their static properties . at large densities",
    "we have the non - perturbative region of qcd describing the strongly interacting matter in thermal equilibrium at finite temperature .",
    "the matter produced in collisions is surely different from the above - described one .",
    "highly coherent parton configurations and strong internal fields become especially important . by colliding two heavy nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies",
    "one expects to get a hot and dense internally colored medium .",
    "it should exhibit some collective properties different from those seen at static conditions .",
    "low - momenta modes in nuclear wave functions can be described in terms of classical fields coupled to some high - momenta static color sources .    according to present knowledge",
    ", the collision process ( energy evolution of all modes ) proceeds through several stages .",
    "we discuss some of them at the beginning of the review .",
    "the corresponding equations describing these processes are also discussed . at one of the stages quarks and gluons",
    "may become deconfined inside some finite volume during a short time interval . according to present knowledge they form some ideal liquid .",
    "its collective properties are revealed by its mechanical motion as a whole described by hydrodynamics and by chromodynamical response to partons penetrating it described by in - medium qcd .    at large",
    "transferred momenta the qcd coupling becomes smaller ( the asymptotical freedom ) and the perturbative approach starts being applicable . experiments on high energy particle collisions are needed precisely to make it possible to study the processes with high transferred momenta . in accordance with the uncertainty principle it implies a possibility to learn the particle structure at ever smaller distances . in this way",
    "the quark - gluon content of a particle , its scale dependence and the properties of the interaction region are studied .",
    "moreover , the hard process inside medium may induce its collective coherent response .",
    "that would allow to study medium properties like explosions in earth depths serve to learn its structure .",
    "this is especially true at highest energies because the parton densities inside colliding strongly interacting nuclei increase with energy .",
    "therefore , the collective effects become pronounced and , in central heavy ion collisions , the long - range correlations appear alongside with the short - range correlations .    to learn experimentally about the properties of the matter inside the interaction region one should study the energy losses of various trial partons moving in it .",
    "this is analogous to studies of energy losses of electrons passing through the ordinary amorphous matter .",
    "recent experimental results of sps ( super proton synchrotron ) and rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider ) clearly show that the collective medium behavior becomes crucial in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the radiation properties of partons are modified and energy spectra of final hadrons as well as their correlations are changed relative to those in pp collisions .",
    "the induced coherent emission reveals the collective response of the medium to partons penetrating it .",
    "the medium itself displays the collective motion .",
    "the hadrochemical content of produced particles changes .",
    "both microscopic and macroscopic qcd approaches to theoretical description of these findings are effective",
    ". mechanical and thermodynamical properties of the medium are studied in the hydrodynamical approach .",
    "we describe all of them in what follows together with discussion of corresponding experimental data . everywhere in this review",
    "we use the system of units in which @xmath1 .",
    "the nucleus - nucleus ( aa ) collisions are studied experimentally at sps and rhic .",
    "the very first question addressed is the difference in aa and pp processes at high energies .",
    "various characteristics were measured and compared .",
    "they clearly show that nuclear collisions can not be considered as an incoherent superposition of the nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "some collective properties of the medium must be taken into account to explain the difference .    *",
    "the yield * of particles produced at rapidity @xmath2 and large transverse momenta @xmath3 is suppressed in aa relative to pp .",
    "this is demonstrated by plotting the nuclear modification factor @xmath4 for single - inclusive hadron cross section : @xmath5 the factor @xmath4 measures the deviation of aa reaction with the number of participant nucleons @xmath6 ( determined by the nuclear overlap function at impact parameter @xmath7 ) from an incoherent superposition of pp reactions for which @xmath8 .",
    "a similar expression can be written for the dihadron correlations ( usually called @xmath9 ) .    both in particle and heavy ion collisions the production of the soft momentum particles with the transverse momenta @xmath10 gev strongly dominates .",
    "the corresponding spectrum decreases exponentially with transverse kinetic energy @xmath11 .",
    "the pion spectra are flatter in the aa collisions than in the pp ones .",
    "this is even more true for kaons and antiprotons with the latter having the smallest slope .",
    "these spectra are used to determine the kinetic freeze - out temperature and the dependence of the transverse flow velocity on the energy and centrality ( i.e. degree of collectivity of the interaction ) .    accordingly ,",
    "soft pions dominate multiplicity distributions .",
    "their shape is approximately described by the negative binomial distributions both in particle and heavy ion collisions at high energies albeit some deflections from them ( predicted by qcd ) are revealed by such correlation measures as their moments .",
    "the shape of the charged hadron transverse momentum spectra changes at @xmath12 gev from the exponential to the power - like as predicted by the perturbative qcd .",
    "this power law tail affects very small yield of particles .",
    "the rhic results on single particle inclusive distributions in central au - au collisions at the energy of 200 gev show the strong @xmath3-independent suppression , @xmath13 , of the hadronic yield at large @xmath14 gev .",
    "the measurements covered the interval in @xmath3 up to 20 gev .",
    "this striking deficit of the high transverse momentum particles points out to the energy loss of partons in the medium .",
    "it corresponds to the so - called jet quenching effect with softened spectra of hadrons produced by partons in the medium compared to the vacuum .",
    "therefore , this suppression factor is a powerful tool to map out the density of the medium .",
    "the high @xmath3 suppression in au - au and cu - cu collisions is comparable at the same number of `` participants '' @xmath6 ( nucleons which underwent at least one inelastic interaction ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath4 is closer to 1 for more peripheral collisions .",
    "it depends on the angular orientation of the high-@xmath3 hadron with respect to the reaction plane ( on the azimuthal angle ) .",
    "this dependence may be explained as due to the dependence of the energy loss on the length traversed by the particle in the medium .",
    "the ratio @xmath4 does not depend on hadron identity at high @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to this , in electrodynamics the radiation of electrons is much stronger than that of the muons .",
    "interesting effects take place for suppression of the spectra of charmed mesons and charmonium .",
    "the former are suppressed at the same level as pions while the latter is suppressed at the same level as at the sps energy @xmath15 .",
    "another intriguing feature of the data is the fact that direct photons seem to be not suppressed in the region of @xmath3 from 4 gev to 15 gev while at very large @xmath16 preliminary data shows a suppression with @xmath17 .    at smaller transverse momenta , @xmath18 gev ,",
    "the suppression effect is weaker , @xmath4 even increases slightly at low @xmath19 gev .",
    "this is qualitatively explained by the parton rescattering in the initial state which leads to the widening of the transverse momenta spectra ( cronin effect ) . at the sps energies the results refer only to this domain of transverse momenta with larger values of @xmath4 than at rhic .",
    "the sps value ( pb - pb at @xmath20=17.3 gev ) of @xmath4 at @xmath21 gev is much larger than at higher energies of rhic exceeding 1 for @xmath22 gev ( strong cronin effect ) . that is awaited from the more important role of gluons as compared to quarks at rhic ( @xmath23 ) . for collisions with smaller overlap d - au at 200 gev",
    "the cronin effect persists at least up to @xmath3=8 gev .",
    "experimental data show that the suppression of inclusive spectra sets in somewhere in between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the dominating process of soft particle production is characterized by the scaling with the number of participants rather than by that in the number of binary collisions typical for hard processes .    * correlations * among the secondary particles are the more sensitive instrument in distinguishing between models predictions than the single particle inclusive data .",
    "their studies revealed many exciting features .",
    "most spectacular of them refer to jets produced in the processes in which high @xmath3 particle is present .",
    "if a high-@xmath3 particle is chosen as a trigger and other hadrons are measured within a surrounding it circle defined by the ( pseudo)rapidity+azimuthal angles in the plane orthogonal to the momentum of the initial particle , then the gaussian - like structure around the trigger ( the near - side jet ) is usually seen in pp - reactions . moreover ,",
    "both two- and three - particle correlations show two back - to - back jet - like peaks ( di - jet production ) .",
    "theoretically , jets are considered , at a first approximation , as survived remnants of hard - scattered quarks and gluons .    in aa collisions",
    ", jets are expected to widen in angles and momentum spectra of their particles are expected to soften .",
    "this phenomenon is termed jet quenching .",
    "quantitative analysis of jet quenching in heavy ion collisions requires model building .",
    "so far there are many uncertainties in their predictions .",
    "also , the biases are introduced by some experimental jet selection criteria . to be less dependent on these effects , different triggers ( e.g. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 )",
    "were used and the away - side hadron spectra were measured .",
    "correlations of non - photonic electrons from charm and bottom decays with hadrons are different for jets with @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons .",
    "multiparticle correlations and fully ( calorimetrically ) reconstructed jets are the main goals of recent efforts in the studies of pp and aa collisions .",
    "first results for fully reconstructed jets in pp , cu - cu , au - au collisions clearly demonstrate that jets are broadened in the quark - gluon medium . in general , the color connections of jets to the bulk or ,",
    "e.g. , to beam remnants in w+jet events and the event - by - event analysis of color flows are also important .",
    "the first experimental hints of intra - jet broadening due to such color flows in them are obtained .",
    "the influence of jet quenching and background fluctuations on conclusions about jet fragmentation functions is actively studied now .",
    "surprisingly enough , no modification of them in aa collisions compared to the pp ones was observed at high @xmath3 in preliminary studies .",
    "probably , it shows that a biased jet population was selected ( surface effect ? ) and the criteria of jet selection should be modified .",
    "even more surprising were observations of completely new topologies called ridge and double - humped events in aa collisions . in central collisions",
    "the near - side jet happens to stand on the pedestal ( ridge ) with long extension in measured pseudorapidities up to @xmath30 and steeply falling in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the presence of the ridge is independent of the jet peak .",
    "the characteristics of this peak are the same as those of bulk particle production",
    ". however , the particle spectrum in the ridge is somewhat harder than that in the bulk .",
    "moreover , this structure is also seen in two - particle correlations without a jet trigger .",
    "these events include all charged hadrons with @xmath31 mev .",
    "the event - by - event three - particle correlation studies in central collisions at higher @xmath32 showed that the particles from the ridge are uncorrelated in pseudorapidity between themselves and with particles in the peak .",
    "the production of the ridge is uncorrelated with the jet - like particle production .",
    "the ridge disappears in the low - multiplicity peripheral collisions and at high @xmath3 of the trigger particle .",
    "both the long pseudorapidity extension of the ridge and large wide clusters found in two - particle correlations points out to the important role of the collective effects .",
    "the away - side peak at @xmath33 is present in pp - collisions but is replaced by the broad away - side structure in au - au collisions .",
    "the two symmetrical maxima ( humps ) are clearly seen in most central collisions at @xmath34 .",
    "they are resolved after the flow effects are subtracted and contain hadrons with small energies .",
    "the peak positions are approximately independent of the transverse momenta of the trigger and associated particles .",
    "the peak heights are slowly increasing with @xmath35 at fixed @xmath36 .",
    "the two humps seem to merge in a single wide hump at large @xmath3 of the trigger ( @xmath37 gev ) .",
    "it indicates on the reappearance of the away - side jet just in - between these humps as it should be in the finite size medium where the parton with extra @xmath3 goes outside it in the form of a jet .",
    "the heavy quark jets possess the similar qualitative features , albeit measured with the lower statistics .",
    "these peculiar features are seen both in two- and three - particle correlations .",
    "they evidence for a conical emission pattern .",
    "the existence of these features is surely related to the collective properties of the medium . in mid - central collisions",
    "the maximum position happens to be shifted for some special choices of the trigger location relative to in- and out - of- planes directions .",
    "this special feature can be explained by the effect of the wake ( see below ) .",
    "the associated yield of away - side hadrons is suppressed at large @xmath3 in au - au collisions relative to the pp ones , albeit less than the single particle spectrum ( @xmath38 while @xmath13 ) .",
    "two - particle correlations between charged hadrons generated by final state coulomb interactions provide valuable information .",
    "also bose - einstein ( be ) correlations between pairs of identical bosons caused by quantum symmetrization of wave functions are studied with the help of ala hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry .",
    "they are observed as an enhancement of pairs of same - sign charged pions at small relative momenta and tell us about the space - time structure and evolution of the source . in central collisions at midrapidity the three radii @xmath39 are usually reconstructed from measurements .",
    "they are directed , correspondingly , along the beam direction , that of the emission of the pair @xmath40 and the one perpendicular to these two . within experimental errors",
    "all the three radii turn out to be equal and rather steeply decreasing with transverse momenta .",
    "this contradicts the hydrodynamical predictions and is , therefore , called the `` rhic hbt puzzle '' .",
    "moreover , recent data show that the hbt characteristics of pp collisions behave in the similar way to those of aa which adds new questions to this puzzle .",
    "the size of the correlated particle emission region increases with the particle multiplicity in the event .",
    "the number of the radii is larger ( 6 ) for non - central collisions .",
    "they grow with the number of participants and exhibit oscillations as functions of the azimuthal angle .",
    "the growth rate decreases with transverse momenta ( as well as the radii themselves ) .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations is larger for more peripheral collisions and vanishes in central collisions .",
    "the modified shape of bosonic resonances created in nuclear collisions has been observed . in all cases",
    "the traditional breit - wigner form gets an excess in its low - energy wing as is revealed in mass - correlations of the decay products .",
    "* collective flows * of final particles present another interesting effect .",
    "these flows are generated by the internal pressure in the quark - gluon medium .",
    "their shapes are determined by spatial characteristics of initial overlap volumes and by interaction dynamics .",
    "the azimuthal angle distribution of emitted particles can be written as @xmath41 ) , \\label{vaa}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 denotes the reaction ( event ) plane determined , independently for each component , from the flow itself : @xmath43>$ ] with average over all particles in all events as indicated by @xmath44 .",
    "the first harmonic coefficient of the fourier expansion of azimuthal distributions , @xmath45 , describes the isotropic radial flow , and the second coefficient , @xmath46 , characterizes the elliptic flow . to the anisotropic flow",
    "there corresponds the azimuthal asymmetry of particle distribution with respect to the reaction plane defined by the beam direction and the vector of impact parameter .",
    "the higher harmonics are also studied .",
    "the `` non - flow '' contributions due to jets , ridge , resonance decays , hbt effects are usually subtracted .",
    "the radial flow manifests itself in flattening ( in aa collisions compared to the pp ones ) of the spectra at small transverse kinetic energy which is stronger for heavier particles .",
    "it scales with energy and the system size .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in central collisions between equal spherical nuclei .",
    "the change of sign of radial flow of protons ( the so - called `` wiggle '' ) as a function of rapidity for the most peripheral events at sps energies has been noticed .",
    "no wiggle is observed at rhic .",
    "the coefficient @xmath45 stays negative ( antiflow ) and steadily increasing for all pseudorapidities .",
    "this shows the early start of collective effects .",
    "the most intensively studied elliptic flow is related , first of all , to the non - centrality of collisions ( the spatial eccentricity of the reaction zone ) and to the rescattering of partons .",
    "the elliptic shape of the overlap region gives rise to different pressure in different directions and , therefore , to non - zero @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the coefficient @xmath46 is sensitive to the system evolution at very early times . the integrated elliptic flow increases with energy .",
    "this increase is stronger in more central collisions than in mid - central ones while the absolute values are smaller .",
    "the value of @xmath46 depends on pseudorapidity with maximum at @xmath47 and increases with energy as well .",
    "it drops about a factor of two around @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is smallest for more central collisions .",
    "the dependence on the transverse momentum has been measured up to @xmath49 gev .",
    "it shows the maximum about @xmath50 gev with @xmath46 becoming as large as 0.2 and then some saturation or slow decrease . at @xmath10 gev @xmath46",
    "is characterized by the scaling with the transverse kinetic energy @xmath51 and at @xmath52 gev  with the number of constituent quarks .",
    "the relation of @xmath46 to the spatial eccentricity of an event depends on the number of participants ( system size ) . the coefficient @xmath46 has been measured for different particle species .",
    "the baryonic elliptic flow saturates at somewhat higher @xmath3 and larger @xmath46 values than for mesons .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is close to 0 for @xmath53 in au - au collisions at 200 gev .    * enhancement * of the yield of various particle species at high @xmath3 in aa collisions as compared to the very strong suppression of pions has been observed .",
    "thus the hadrochemical compositions in aa and pp collisions are different .",
    "this is considered as a manifestation of the quark - gluon plasma ( or , more generally , of the prehadronic state ) effects .",
    "neutral pions and @xmath54-mesons at high @xmath22 gev are strongly ( about 5 times ) suppressed in central aa collisions relative to pp processes .",
    "the suppression of @xmath55 mesons is the same at high @xmath56 gev but smaller in the intermediate @xmath57 gev range .",
    "no suppression is seen for photons in this kinematic range .",
    "the proton production is enhanced at intermediate @xmath58 gev so that the ratio @xmath59 becomes close to 1 .",
    "quite surprising is the fact that in aa at rhic antiprotons are as abundant as negative pions for @xmath22 gev .",
    "that is probably related to the collective transverse flow . in particle collisions the strange particles production at high @xmath3",
    "is strongly suppressed compared to pions ( 3 - 4 times ) but it is enhanced by about the factor of two in aa processes so that the suppression factor becomes about 0.6 - 0.7 . the enhancement is larger for particles with higher strangeness content such as @xmath60 , @xmath61 . the overall fraction of strange particles is about twice as high in heavy - ion collisions as compared to the elementary particle collisions .",
    "the similar relatively small suppression factor was measured for charmed quarks ( @xmath53 ) . the upper limit for bottom ( @xmath62 ) suppression of 0.64",
    "was recently obtained .",
    "a strong suppression of the high-@xmath3 electrons originating from the decays of charm and beauty hadrons indicates the same value of suppression for heavy and light quarks in the quark - gluon medium .",
    "this shows that the initial stage of creation of highly virtual quarks is more important than their subsequent mass difference .",
    "the change in the hadrochemical content of collision products with high @xmath3 may reflect a difference in in - medium interactions of the species and asks for taking into account the collective ( non - local ) properties of the medium ( with possible diffusion before hadronization ) .",
    "remarkably enough , at very low @xmath63 gev of secondary particles their yields seem to be the same in pp , aa and even @xmath64 processes ( albeit different for different species ) and independent of the primary energy as is expected from universality of coherent processes for long - wavelength gluons .",
    "the above statements can be illustrated by numerous figures which can be found in experimental presentations and more specialized review papers .",
    "we will only show some of them to elucidate theoretical argumentation . that would allow to keep the reasonable size of this article .",
    "all these observations are closely related to the general physical process of the energy loss of partons during nuclei collisions which is to the large extent the topic to which the present review is devoted to .",
    "the microscopic qcd description of all processes with thousands of particles produced is surely impractical in the whole phase space region . such a description may be applicable to the relatively rare high-@xmath3 subprocesses where the qcd coupling constant becomes smaller . for soft partons and hadrons the rescattering and hadronization effects are too strong to leave many traces of the primary inelastic process .",
    "the macroscopic approach ( including the statistical one ) is more suitable for description of purely collective medium effects .",
    "one can nevertheless follow general evolution of fields during heavy ion collisions and reveal typical correlation patterns by applying main principles of qcd . in this context , the present paradigm , which we describe below , pictures the transition from the color glass condensate ( cgc ) to glasma eventually evolving into quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) and subsequent hadronization .",
    "the energy loss of partons in the quark - gluon medium is the main source of experimental information about its properties during these stages . as in electrodynamics",
    ", it may be separated in the two categories .",
    "the loss due to the change of the velocity vector of a parton such as elastic scattering , bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation is usually treated microscopically .",
    "all these phenomena result from the _ short - range _ response of the parton to the impact of the matter fields .",
    "elastic scattering does change the parton energy due to the recoil effect and deflects it and thus changes the energy flow in the initial direction . at high energies",
    "this process is less probable than the emission of gluons ( bremsstrahlung ) due to the nearby collisions with the matter constituents .",
    "the medium structure imposes some restrictions on the coherence properties of the radiation process and on the effective radiation length ( in analogy to the ter - mikhaelyan and landau - pomeranchuk effects in electrodynamics ) . in the general case",
    ", the intensity of the radiation depends on the relation of the path length of the parton in the medium , its mean free path ( depending on the distance between the scattering centers and on the cross section ) and the formation length of emitted radiation .",
    "the synchrotron radiation of gluons induced by the curvature of parton trajectory in chromomagnetic fields may become important for strong enough fields .",
    "these processes are considered in the section 3 .",
    "a principally different source of energy losses is connected with the medium polarization by the propagating parton .",
    "here one speaks about the collective response of the medium related to the non - perturbative _ long - range _ interconnection of its constituents described by its chromopermittivity .",
    "this is treated macroscopically within the in - medium qcd .",
    "the corresponding effects are analogous to the cherenkov radiation , the wake and the transition radiation . in these processes",
    "one can , in the first approximation , neglect the change of the velocity vector of a parton . the macroscopical aspect of the problem is sometimes ignored in the review papers and we will discuss it in more details in section 4 .",
    "let us note that the total energy loss is the sum of the losses due to short - range and long - range interactions .",
    "is it possible to work out a quantitative description of multiparticle production in hadronic and nuclear collisions within qcd ?",
    "an ambitious attempt of answering this question is provided by the paradigm of color glass condensate ( cgc ) , see e.g. the reviews @xcite . in the words of one of the principal creators of this paradigm , `` color glass condensate is a universal form of matter which controls the high energy limit of all strong interaction processes and is the part of the hadron wavefunction important at such energies '' @xcite .",
    "the strength of the cgc approach to the physics of high energy scattering is in providing a unifying concept for such important but previously separately existing notions as soft ( wee ) and constituent partons , stringy and jetty particle production , structure functions and limiting fragmentation , etc .",
    "multiparticle production in qcd is generated by low @xmath65 partons in the nuclear wavefunctions ( cgc ) .",
    "chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields in the medium under consideration are the strongest fields in nature .",
    "when two `` pancakes '' of cgc collide , they form matter with very high density called glasma .",
    "it preceeds the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "glasma consists of color flux tubes localized in the transverse plane and stretching between the valence color degrees of freedom .",
    "these tubes generate long - range correlations responsible for flat distributions in pseudorapidity @xmath66 .",
    "the existence of long - range ( pseudo)rapidity correlations is related to the early times of glasma formation in nuclear collisions @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the proper time of production of the particles @xmath69 and @xmath7 with the rapidities @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the radial flow collimates particles in the direction of the flow and generates azimuthal correlations but does not affect the distribution over @xmath66 . in particular , the ridge could be explained as the combination of the initial state long - range rapidity correlations and the final state radial flow",
    ". therefore combined elements of the both micro - and macro- approaches are necessary to explain the ridge phenomenon .",
    "color glass condensate is an effective theory describing hadronic and nuclear wavefunctions in the regime where the main contribution to the cross - section is coming from their multiparton fock components , i.e. in essence from the dense gluon matter .",
    "the key idea behind the physical picture of cgc can be formulated as follows .",
    "let us consider a fast hadron ( nucleus ) moving along the @xmath72 axis with the big longitudinal light - cone momentum @xmath73 .",
    "the modes in the projectile are classified by their relative yields of longitudinal momenta @xmath74 .",
    "then , from uncertainty relation , the characteristic longitudinal extension of these modes is @xmath75 and their characteristic lifetime is @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are defined below in equation ( [ lccoor ] ) ] where @xmath78 is some characteristic scale of transverse momentum .",
    "we see that the hard constituent modes , for which @xmath79 , are localized at small distances and have large lifetimes , while the soft wee modes , for which @xmath80 , are spread over large longitudinal distances and are short - lived . from the data on structure functions from deep inelastic scattering",
    "we know that the number of wee partons , most importantly gluons , is rapidly growing with @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83 , so that these modes are characterized by large occupation numbers . for such modes",
    "it is natural to replace the language of particles by that of fields , and , in turn , for the coherent multiparticle states the appropriate description is that in terms of _ classical _ fields .",
    "these considerations lie at the origin of the mclerran - venugopalan model of nuclear light - cone wavefunctions @xcite in which , in the framework of qcd , the constituent and wee partons are integrated in the unifying picture in which strongly localized slowly evolving constituent hard modes are considered as the _ source _ for the delocalized soft wee gluon field for which one has to take into account nonlinear effects leading , in particular , to the saturation of the gluon distribution , see below .",
    "let us introduce the variables to be used in this section .",

    "the main difficulty lies in the fact that the medium created in high energy nuclear collisions is necessarily of some finite extent , so that the modifications induced by the medium are dependent on its characteristics in space - time : one has to place the cascade inside the medium , see fig .  1 in which the origin of the cascade is placed at some distance @xmath195 from the border separating the dense medium from the normal vacuum",
    ".    [ fcascade ]     obviously , the larger the distance of parton propagation in the medium , the bigger are the medium - induced losses .",
    "the key question is therefore to choose , for describing the in - medium qcd cascade , the language allowing a credible space - time interpretation .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the only scheme allowing such interpretation is the old - style pythia virtuality - ordered cascade where connection to the spatiotemporal pattern is achieved by calculating the lifetime @xmath89 of a virtual parton which , for a parton with the energy @xmath242 and virtuality @xmath243 that has been created in the decay of its parent parton with the virtuality @xmath244 , reads @xmath245 the lifetime of the initial parton is taken to be @xmath246 .",
    "for example , the time @xmath247 at which the parton with the momentum @xmath248 in fig .  1 produced the final prehadron is @xmath249,\\ ] ] where @xmath250 .",
    "we have already mentioned that in the absolute majority of studies devoted to energy loss in high energy nuclear collisions it is assumed that hadronization takes place outside of the hot and dense fireball . setting out the clock with the help of the formula ( [ formtime ] ) helps to address this issue quantitatively @xcite .",
    "for example , for the parton @xmath248 in fig .  1 it happened that @xmath251 so that both its formation at time @xmath252 and its decay into final prehadron took place inside the medium . to get a feeling for the corresponding physics ,",
    "let us consider , for example , a gluon with the energy @xmath253 equipped with a typical initial invariant mass @xmath254 .",
    "this gluon will on the average decay at @xmath255 , so that if the vertex in which the initial hard gluon was generated was sufficiently far ( several fermies ) from the surface of hot fireball , a significant part of cascade vertices will in fact be generated inside the medium .    in what follows",
    "we shall concentrate on the description of the old - style pythia virtuality - ordered cascade and its in - medium modifications .",
    "the cascade evolution goes through a sequence of decays @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is a four - momentum of the parent gluon and @xmath258 are those of the daughter ones .",
    "we study the timelike evolution in which cascading reshuffles the initial jet virtuality in such a way that at each decay one has @xmath259 .",
    "the cascading process at a given branch stops when a virtuality of the last parton reaches a threshold level @xmath260 , i.e. no decay into two partons with minimal virtuality @xmath261 can occur .",
    "the key property of the in - vacuum qcd cascades , effective angular ordering of subsequent decays due to color coherence ( i.e. ensuring that , e.g. , @xmath262 in fig .  1 ) , is not automatically taken into account in the mass - ordered evolution and has to be enforced explicitly by accepting only those generated decays for which the condition of angular ordering does hold .",
    "the basic ingredient of the probabilistic formalism of qcd cascade evolution is the conditional probability for a parton produced at the scale @xmath263 with the energy @xmath242 to undergo a subsequent decay at the scale @xmath264 into two daughter partons with the energies @xmath265 and @xmath266 correspondingly that can be calculated from the sudakov formfactor @xmath267,\\ ] ] where @xmath268 define the kinematic limits available for the parton decay @xmath269 and where the full differential probability of gluon emission @xmath270 was defined in ( [ genspect ] ) .",
    "when considering the properties of the in - medium qcd cascades one has to deal with several mechanisms modifying the in - vacuum intrajet characteristics , in particular the loss of quantum coherence and the resulting disruption of angular ordering for decays inside the medium , the medium - induced radiation ( inelastic energy loss ) and elastic scattering of partons on particles in the medium ( elastic energy loss ) .",
    "below we shall describe the corresponding modifications of the mc procedure for generation of the in - vacuum qcd cascades that take these features into account .",
    "let us start with the decoherence - induced disruption of angular ordering @xcite .",
    "the violent environment created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions acts as a source of random energy - momentum and color with respect to the diagrams for the in - vacuum processes . generally speaking",
    ", this kind of random impact ruins the phase tuning lying at the heart of quantum interference phenomena .",
    "the situations in which random external influences destroy the interference - related effects are very common in solid state physics .",
    "a well - studied example is provided by the destruction of the weak localization in the presence of random external impacts , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus it is intuitively quite clear that the quantum coherence effects should be broken in the violent environment created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this was first explicitly mentioned in @xcite , in which the origin of decoherence and ensuing disappearance of angular ordering was related to rescattering of cascading particles on scattering centers in the medium .",
    "another argument in support of the assumption of angular decoherence is the fact that , at least at the level of vlasov approximation , the characteristic time of color randomization is much less than the characteristic scattering time @xcite .",
    "as color randomization alone is sufficient for angular decoherence , one could expect that this effect is even stronger than assumed in @xcite .",
    "the simplest assumption taking into account this effect is that angular ordering is broken for all the decays that take place inside the medium .",
    "the effect is thus directly dependent on size of the medium available for the cascade development . in terms of notations introduced in fig .  1 , the effect is @xmath195-dependent .",
    "the corresponding modifications of the rapidity distributions are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we see that the decoherence effects alone , i.e. before considering medium - induced energy loss , lead to substantial softening of the intrajet particle spectrum .     of final prehadrons : 1 )",

    "let us now turn to the effects of the medium - induced radiation .",
    "a rigorous treatment of this problem is very difficult . only very recently in @xcite",
    "an elegant formalism allowing to take into account lpm effect in the mc cascades was described .",
    "the results of modifications of qcd cascade properties were obtained using simpler schemes based on various approximations for the effective differential spectrum ( [ genspect ] ) or , equivalently , to the modified splitting function @xmath275 that depends , generally speaking , not only on the energy ratio @xmath72 but also on the energy and virtuality of the parent parton , stopping power of the medium , path length in the medium , etc . @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of the medium - modified splitting function mimicking the effects of medium - induced radiation was suggested in @xcite : @xmath276 a more advanced definition of the medium - induced splitting function was proposed @xcite : @xmath277 where @xmath278 is taken from eq .",
    "( [ fullspect ] ) .    with the concrete expressions for the modified splitting functions like ( [ splitfmed]),([splitspectrum ] ) the main ingredient for the description of the cascade , the sudakov formfactor ( [ sff ] ) , is fully specified .",
    "the main quantity addressed in these mc simulations is the jet quenching ratio @xmath279 .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is achieved by tuning the parameters of the medium like @xmath280 or @xmath281 . in most cases",
    "the agreement can indeed be reached - however , at the expense of very large variations in the values of these parameters obtained within different formalisms and of the numerous theoretical uncertainties .    as to the more generic intrajet characteristics , the general expectation concerning the effect of the medium - induced interactions are :    * softening of the rapidity distributions . * broadening of the distributions in transverse momentum . * increased multiplicity .",
    "these expectations are indeed confirmed by the studies undertaken with the above - described mc generators @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "more involved properties of medium - modified cascades such as higher order multiplicity moments were also studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "macroscopic collective properties of a medium may reveal itself in its mechanical motion as a whole ( e.g. , viscosity ) described by hydrodynamics or in its response to external color currents ( e.g. , chromopermittivity ) described by in - medium qcd . here",
    "we mostly deal with the latter approach discussing hydrodynamics at the end very briefly because there exist many extensive reviews of it ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    considering the evolution of energy flows due to the elastic scattering , bremsstrahlung or synchrotron radiation",
    "one follows the fate of an initial source ( a particle , a parton , a dipole etc ) and the medium impact on these processes .",
    "the evolution of its velocity vector is crucial for conclusions about its energy losses .",
    "the notion of the coherence length becomes important when multiple rescattering is taken into account .",
    "however , the medium itself can radiate in response to permutations .",
    "the genuine role of the medium and its collective properties are most clearly revealed by its polarization @xmath282 due to the external current .",
    "the macroscopic approach to the description of such collective properties is the most suitable one .",
    "the linear response of the medium to the electromagnetic field @xmath283 is usually described as @xmath284 where @xmath285 is the dielectric permittivity .",
    "it is seen that the polarization can be quite strong for large values of @xmath285 .",
    "the initial radiation process serves as a trigger for the collective response of the medium initiated by the polarization .",
    "the well known examples are provided by the cherenkov radiation , the wake and the transition radiation .",
    "what is typical for their description is the ( approximate ) constancy of the particle velocity vector used in the external current . in ultrarelativistic processes @xmath286 )",
    "the relative change of the velocity is much smaller than the relative energy loss because they are connected by the formula @xmath287 and the above statement is well supported .",
    "the velocity loss can become noticeable only for non - relativistic partons .    in what follows",
    "we consider very high energy processes .",
    "it is well known that the gluons become the main component of the wave functions of the colliding hadrons . at lhc ,",

    "the higher order corrections may be calculated ( see section 4.5 ) and quite interesting conclusion about the color rainbow is obtained .",
    "the most economical way of description of matter properties is to take into account an impact of internal currents in the medium phenomenologically by the chromopermittivity @xmath285 introduced as a constant in eqs ( [ f.6 ] ) , ( [ f.7 ] ) .",
    "its spatio - temporal dependence may be included similar to electrodynamics .",
    "for the fourier components of @xmath285 this would imply the dependence on the frequency @xmath317 and the wave vector @xmath318 .",
    "it is well known in electrodynamics that the magnetic permeability is then automatically taken into account .",
    "therefore it is necessary to consider the permittivity tensor and its color dependence .",
    "these complications can become important but even in electrodynamics they are often ignored .",
    "the medium is often assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "methods of linear response theory are applied .",

    "moreover , it has an imaginary part determining the absorption .",
    "the energy behavior of @xmath285 determines the scales specific for a particular substance .",
    "all these features are usually found experimentally using the relation between the dielectric permittivity and the refraction index @xmath319 @xmath320 for example , both @xmath321 and @xmath322 for water have been measured in a wide energy interval ranging over 20 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the real part @xmath321 is approximately constant in the visible light region ( @xmath323 ) , increases at low @xmath317 ( up to @xmath324 ) and becomes smaller than 1 at high energies , tending to 1 at frequencies exceeding the langmuir ( plasma ) frequency @xmath325 as @xmath326 the imaginary part ( @xmath322 ) responsible for the absorption is very small for visible light but drastically increases in nearby regions both at low and high frequencies ( in this way the nature saves our eyes ! ) .",

    "the borders of the optical region define the scales for @xmath328 .",
    "theoretically this behavior is ascribed to various collective excitations in water relevant to its response to radiation with different frequencies . among them",
    "the resonance excitations are quite prominent ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . even in electrodynamics , the quantitative theory of this behavior is still lacking , however .",
    "moreover the formula ( [ eed ] ) is purely electrodynamical one and does not take into account hadronic processes at extremely high energies where the hadronic components of photon wave functions are important .",
    "then , what can we say about the chromopermittivity ?    the chromopermittivity can be calculated from the polarization operator . up to now , the attempts to calculate the chromopermittivity from first principles are not very convincing .",

    "however , no convincing principles of their choice exist and the number of adjustable energy dependent parameters increases even though they are related with more fundamental microscopic notions .",
    "experimental data surely favor strong response of the medium to deposited energy .",
    "it implies that the chromopermittivity must be defined in terms of non - perturbative in - medium gluon field correlation functions that are as yet unknown .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to consider the chromopermittivity as a complicated function of @xmath313 and , correspondingly , the eqs ( [ f.6 ] ) , ( [ f.7 ] ) as strongly non - linear in @xmath313 even at the classical level because @xmath315 takes into account some quantum and non - abelian effects .    in view of this situation , we prefer to use the general formulae of the scattering theory @xcite to estimate the chromopermittivity .",

    "densely populated ring - like regions within two narrow intervals of polar angles ( corresponding to peaks in fig .",
    "[ coscher ] ) but widely distributed in azimuthal angles for each of them . therefore such events were termed ring - like events . the peaks were interpreted as effects due to cherenkov gluons emitted by the forward and backward moving initial high energy partons . in cosmic ray events",
    "the energies of partons are high and the effect can be related to the high - energy behavior of @xmath419 .",
    "it is important to notice that the energies of particles produced within the humps ( rings ) in rhic data are rather low on the scale of initial energies .",
    "even the energies of jets - parents in the double - humped events are lower than 5 gev .",
    "therefore the whole effect at rhic can be related to the low - energy region .",
    "one of the most intriguing problems is to understand properly the fact that the rhic and cosmic ray data were fitted with very different values of the chromopermittivity , close to 6 and 1 correspondingly .",
    "this could be interpreted as due to the difference in values of @xmath65 ( the parton share of energy ) and @xmath243 ( the transverse momenta squared ) and the lorentz - transformation to different rest systems .",
    "it is well known that the region of large @xmath65 and @xmath243 corresponds to the dilute partonic system . at low @xmath65 and",

    "the observed effect is related to the leading partons with large @xmath65 .",
    "also , the experimentalists pointed out that the transverse momenta in this event are quite large .",
    "in this region one would expect for low parton density and very small @xmath337 . in distinction to a single parton traversing the medium at rhic energies , the collision of forward moving partons at the lhc may be considered as the collision of the two relatively dilute _ bunches _ of partons . nevertheless , the macroscopic approach is valid there as well .",
    "thus the same medium can probably be considered as a liquid or a gas depending on the parton energy and transferred momenta .",
    "this statement can be experimentally verified by using triggers positioned at different angles to the collision axis and considering different transverse momenta . in that way",
    ", the hadronic cherenkov effect can be used as a tool to scan ( @xmath420)-plane and plot on it the parton densities corresponding to its different regions .      in central collisions",
    "the interaction region is symmetrical and the change of the trigger position might lead to some effect only if the chromopermittivity strongly depends on @xmath317 .",
    "it is not likely to be the case for narrow energy intervals .",
    "however , in mid - central nuclear collisions the interaction region itself becomes asymmetrical reminding the rugby ball .",
    "therefore new effects can appear when the angular position of the trigger is changed .",
    "it has been found ( see figs 2 and 3 in @xcite ) that the similar two - hump structure appears but with some additional contribution noticeable at a particular orientation of the trigger particle just in between the in - plane and out - of - plane directions .",
    "it was stated in @xcite that `` at present , it is unclear whether this merely reflects a geometry dependent shift in the away - side peaks or perhaps an additional contribution at @xmath421 '' .",

    ", it is strongly influenced by the special geometry of mid - central collisions in such a way that the wake radiation at about @xmath423-orientation of the trigger particle can escape the overlap region much easier than wake gluons for in- and out - of - plane orientations of the trigger particle .    according to eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) the second term corresponds to the radiation induced by the longitudinal oscillations in the wake left behind the away - side parton .",
    "it is emitted mostly in the direction perpendicular to the wake . that reminds the dipole radiation .",

    "the enhanced and depleted charge density regions alternate .",
    "the @xmath424-singularity is however stronger than the @xmath425 dipole distributions .",
    "it must be somehow saturated in the vicinity of @xmath426 by the spatial dispersion of @xmath285 .",
    "therefore one may use this term for qualitative conclusions in the region not very close to @xmath426 .    the estimates @xcite of the relative importance of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) show that the wake radiation is negligible at the peak of the cherenkov humps at @xmath427 .",

    ". moreover , the wake radiation exists only for non - zero imaginary part of @xmath377 while the cherenkov radiation also exists and gets the traditional @xmath359-functional angular shape for real @xmath285 .",
    "the effect of transverse wake in hydrodynamics is completely different .",
    "it produces a strong peak in the away - side direction at @xmath432 @xcite which is not observed in experiment .      in 1945",
    "ginzburg and i.m .",
    "frank proposed the idea about the transition radiation @xcite .",
    "any electric charge passing from some medium to another one or moving with ( almost ) constant velocity in inhomogeneous medium with variable dielectric permittivity induces its polarization and radiation of photons .",
    "this property has been used , e.g. , to build the transition radiation tracker in atlas ( a toroidal lhc apparatus ) detector at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the transition radiation is determined by restructuring of the electromagnetic field surrounding the electric charge .    during hadron ( nucleus ) collisions",
    "the partons intersect the surface of the partner particle ( nucleus ) .",
    "this transition should induce abrupt changes of their color fields and , consequently , radiation of gluons .",
    "the classical in - medium qcd equations coincide in their general structure with electrodynamical equations . since this approach happens to be successful with cherenkov gluons and wakes it is tempting to apply the ginzburg - frank formula to estimate the number of gluons emitted per unit length within some frequency and angular intervals @xmath433 where @xmath434 are the chromopermittivities of the media @xmath435 as felt by relativistic ( @xmath436 ) partons traversing the surface when passing from @xmath7 to @xmath69 . in equation ( [ gfra ] ) we have omitted the color casimir factors .",
    "there is important difference between cherenkov and transition radiations .",
    "cherenkov radiation can be observed only if the particle moves in the medium with @xmath356 .",
    "its intensity is proportional to @xmath437 according to ( [ f.17 ] ) .",
    "transition radiation is proportional to @xmath438 ( see ( [ gfra ] ) ) and appears at any change of @xmath285 . in electrodynamics",
    "it is studied mostly in the frequency interval where the formula ( [ eed ] ) is applicable i.e. where @xmath439 .",
    "namely this behavior of the dielectric permittivity is responsible for specific features of the transition radiation . in the case of the nuclear medium",
    "it is unknown whether the analogous formula may be used in any energy region . for narrow energy intervals",
    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath337 to be constant . at very high energies",
    "the dependence ( [ eom ] ) may be used .",
    "both these assumptions find some support in rhic and cosmic ray data as discussed above .",
    "that is why we consider @xcite first these two possibilities .",
    "the away - side parton at rhic is created inside the quark - gluon medium , moves through it and escapes in the vacuum where it hadronizes . according to the above estimates @xmath440 . using ( [ gfra ] )",
    "one gets the bremsstrahlung - like spectrum with both infrared and collinear divergencies in asymptotics @xmath441 at finite energies the angular divergence is replaced by the maximum at @xmath442 . anyway , this radiation is collimated near the initial direction of the away - side parton and is hard to detect because of the strong background .",
    "the similar conclusions are obtained @xcite for the radiation by a gluon moving in a stochastic medium .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath443 the intensity of the transition radiation ( [ sle ] ) does not depend on @xmath444 .",
    "according to ( [ eom ] ) for the forward moving partons with extremely high energies the deviation of chromopermittivity from unity is very small . then @xmath445 the collinear divergence remains the same but the energy spectrum gets a strong peak near @xmath341 .",
    "it implies that the resonance - like almost monochromatic subjets with masses close to @xmath341 will be produced at lhc energies .",
    "these `` resonances '' are mostly created by gluons and , therefore , are neutral .",
    "the most favored channel would be to observe them as peaks in mass spectra of forward moving @xmath446-pairs near @xmath341 .",
    "unfortunately , there exists no clear prescription how to translate the threshold energy in hadronic reactions to gluons .",
    "if observed , peaks locations and their disappearence at @xmath447 due to @xmath448 would provide us information about that .    one may hope that the confinement and hadronization do not spoil these conclusions .",
    "this is supported by observation of effects due to cherenkov gluons .",
    "however , the transition radiation might be stronger influenced by confinement near the qgp surface than collective excitations inside the volume .",
    "from one side , it shortens the radiation length but , from another side , the abrupt variation of color fields surrounding partons when they come out of the quark - gluon plasma and hadronize may enlarge the transition radiation because of strong confining forces . at the same time the transition radiation may appear in much wider energy intervals than cherenkov radiation ( in particular , at @xmath449 ) .",
    "however , neither experimental nor theoretical arguments about the chromopermittivity in these regions exist nowadays .",
    "it would not be surprising if we find its effects outside the regions where the double - humped events were observed . that may somewhat smoothen down the structures near @xmath341 .",
    "another way to account for difference of vacuum and medium chromopermittivities is to consider different masses of gluons and values of the running coupling in these two enviroments .",
    "it was done in @xcite where the transition radiation of heavy quarks was treated in microscopic approach .",
    "it was shown that it can be as important as the induced gluon radiation . however , the conclusions are still indefinite because of strong cancellation effects and assumptions about the behavior of the coupling constant .",
    "one should also point out important problem of the finite size @xmath195 of hadronic objects .",
    "it always induces ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) the factors like @xmath450 in emission probabilities .",
    "estimates of the scale length @xmath451 are still not very definite .",
    "this problem is closely connected with decisions about the radiation ( formation ) lengths and/or about the points where the partons were created .      the ala tachyonic model ( [ eom ] ) proposed for the chromopermittivity at high energies is inevitably related with instabilities of the quark - gluon medium . the dielectric permittivity of the macroscopic matter ( e.g. , as given by ( [ eed ] ) ) is usually considered in its rest system which is well defined . for collisions of two nuclei ( or hadrons ) such",
    "a system requires special definition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , for fast forward moving partons the spectators ( the medium ) are formed by the partons of another ( target ) nucleus at rest .",
    "thus we consider a problem of the system of the quark - gluon medium impinged by a bunch of fast partons similar to the problem of plasma physics , namely , that of the interaction of the electron bunch with plasma @xcite .",
    "this differs from rhic conditions when partons scattered at @xmath452 were considered as moving in the medium with its rest system coinciding with the nuclei center of mass system .",
    "two complications are to be considered .",
    "first , there are selected directions of the current ( @xmath72-axis ) and its radiation .",
    "this is cured by introducing the permittivity tensor as @xmath453 second , the impinging bunch content is similar to that of the target ( plasma - plasma collisions ! ) and its permittivity must also be accounted for . in the projectile system",
    "it is the same as the permittivity of the target in its rest system , i.e. given by ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "then one takes into account that the total induced current is the sum of currents induced in the target and in the projectile and lorentz - transforms the projectile internal fields , polarization vector and currents to the target rest system where we consider the whole process . in this way the lorentz transformation of the conductivity tensor @xmath454 ( and , correspondingly , of @xmath455 ) ) is found as it is done in @xcite . using the current conservation and classical field equations ( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) with @xmath456 one gets for non - zero components of the chromopermittivity tensor @xmath457 here @xmath458 and @xmath459 are the transverse and longitudinal components of @xmath460 .",
    "we use the approximation of high energies ( large @xmath461 factor , i.e. @xmath462 ) .",
    "the terms depending on @xmath26 are due to the impinging partons .",
    "they can be omitted everywhere except the terms which determine the cherenkov gluon radiation at @xmath463 .",
    "the classical equations derived from ( [ f.6 ] ) , ( [ f.7 ] ) and written in the momentum space have solution if the following dispersion equation is valid @xmath464 it is of the sixth order in momenta dimension .",
    "however , the sixth order terms cancel and ( [ disp ] ) leads to two equations ( of the second order ) : @xmath465 @xmath466 they determine the internal modes of the medium and the bunch propagation through the medium , correspondingly .",
    "the equation ( [ plas ] ) shows that the quark - gluon medium is unstable because there exists the branch with @xmath467 for modes @xmath468 .",
    "thus the energy increase of the total cross sections responsible for positiveness of @xmath469 at high energies is related to the instability of the quark - gluon medium .",
    "the equation ( [ bunch ] ) has solutions corresponding to cherenkov gluons emitted by the impinging bunch and determined by the last term in ( [ bunch ] ) .",

    "therefore , the positive @xmath477 in ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) correspond to the absolute instability of the system .",
    "let us note that the instability at @xmath471 is stronger than at @xmath478 approximately by the factor @xmath479 ( this factor is about 4 times larger at lhc compared to rhic ) .",
    "the instability exponent ( [ d1 ] ) decreases as @xmath480 and is about 16 times smaller at lhc compared to rhic .",
    "it tends to zero asymptotically .",
    "thus cherenkov gluons are emitted with constant transverse momentum @xmath471 and their number , at high energies , is proportional to @xmath481 where @xmath482 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) with account of the threshold above which this equation is applicable .",
    "it differs from the traditional folklore of constant emission angle of cherenkov radiation and the number of gluons @xmath483 ( or the total energy loss proportional to @xmath484 ) .",
    "this difference is easily explained by eqs ( [ f.10 ] ) , ( [ f.17 ] ) which give @xmath485=const and the energy loss @xmath484 for @xmath285=const and @xmath486 and @xmath487 energy loss for @xmath488 .",
    "if the data about @xmath469 for hadronic processes are used in ( [ f.19 ] ) and fitted by ( [ eom ] ) then the value of @xmath489 depends on the density of scatterers @xmath347 and with above estimates can be of gev order .      in the equations of in - medium qcd ( [ f.6]),([f.7 ] ) considered in the subsection 4.1 one",
    "assumed the chromopermittivity to be abelian , @xmath490 .",
    "the simplest generalization of the equations ( [ f.6]),([f.7 ] ) taking into account the nonabelian properties of the chromopermittivity @xmath491 take into account the tensor structure of @xmath491 .",
    "let us write the corresponding generalization of ( [ f.6]),([f.7 ] ) in the leading order in the coupling constant : @xmath492 where @xmath493 are the components of the external color current @xmath494 defined in ( [ f.11 ] )",
    ".    from the physical meaning of the chromopermittivity @xmath491 there follows that the most general expression for the chromopermittivity is a symmetric tensor @xmath495 with the equal diagonal @xmath496 and off - diagonal @xmath497 components . to elucidate the physical content of the equations ( [ teneps ] )",
    "let us consider the similarity transformation @xmath498 diagonalizing the matrix @xmath491 : @xmath499 in ( [ diag ] ) the matrix @xmath500 is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the chromopermittivity tensor @xmath501 , where @xmath502 , on the diagonal .",
    "it is easy to show that within the above - described assumptions on the structure of @xmath491 one has : @xmath503 the rotation @xmath498 allows to diagonalize ( [ teneps ] ) in terms of the modified fields @xmath504 and the modified current @xmath505 : @xmath506 from the above - described structure of the eigenvalues ( [ eigen ] ) there follows an existence of the two different solutions of the equations ( [ tenepsd ] ) corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath507 : @xmath508 and the analogous solutions for @xmath509 .",
    "returning to the original fields @xmath510 one evidently gets the solution corresponding to the presence of the color cherenkov rainbow formed by the cherenkov radiation at the angles @xmath511 in the limit @xmath512 the solution ( [ modsol ] ) turns into the standard solution ( [ f.11]),([f.12 ] ) .    to account for the nonlinear contributions to the in - medium yang - mills equations",
    "it is necessary to use the corresponding generalizations of ( [ teneps ] ) . to demonstrate the possible practical consequences of such an approach in @xcite one described the procedure of the model calculations of the nonlinear contributions to the gluon cherenkov radiation , albeit with some simplified ( and nonrealistic ) assumptions concerning the color structure of the chromopermittivity .",
    "it was shown that in the case under consideration in the solutions there appear contributions of the form @xmath513^{5/4}}\\ ] ] and @xmath514^{3/4}},\\ ] ] which correspond to the color rainbow and differ ( despite some similarity ) from the lowest order solution ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the chromodynamical properties of qgp described above are its average characteristics measured by a test parton .",
    "therefore they are more robust than the thermodynamical and mechanical characteristics which change during the evolution of the quark - gluon medium .",
    "spatial and temporal information is necessary to get the latter .",
    "the lattice calculations and ideas about cgc , glasma , qgp provide some hints to transition from confined state to deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "the inelastic collisions may lead to thermalization of the medium .",
    "subsequently , it expands and hydrodynamics may be applied to treat this stage of evolution . it is described in many reviews ( e.g. , see @xcite ) and we give just a brief survey of it here .",
    "the medium is characterized by 6 independent variables .",
    "those are the energy density @xmath515 , pressure @xmath516 , baryon number @xmath517 and 3 components of the velocity vector @xmath518 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor and baryon number current are @xmath519 the evolution of these variables is described by six equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "those are five non - linear partial differential equations obtained from local conservation laws for energy , momentum and baryon number @xmath520 and an equation of state relating @xmath521 and @xmath517 .",
    "the latter is usually chosen in the closest possible form to the results of lattice qcd by normalization on the states below and above the critical temperature ( i.e. , hadrons to a quark - gluon medium ) .",
    "this is a rather arbitrary element of the whole approach . besides",
    ", the solutions of the non - linear equations in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions ask for initial conditions to be defined and may be only obtained numerically with several external parameters .",
    "that is the origin of several conflicting results as was discussed above with references to @xcite .",
    "the cgc and glasma approaches provide some guesses to the initial conditions for the evolution of a thermalized qgp .",
    "however , the evolution of the glasma into a thermalized qgp is not yet understood .",
    "at least four parameters are necessary to fix the initial conditions and freeze - out algorithm which determines the transition from the hydrodynamical characteristics to hadronic stage .",
    "those are the initial time @xmath522 , energy ( or entropy ) density @xmath523 , baryon number @xmath524 and the freeze - out temperature ( or decoupling energy density ) @xmath525 .",
    "they are fixed by comparison of the theoretical results with the experimental data .",
    "schematically , the correspondence of these parameters and experimental characteristics can be represented as @xmath526 . moreover , from the overlap geometry of the two colliding nuclei one can define the shape of the initial density profiles as well as make assumptions concerning the profiles of the initial longitudinal and transverse flows and the prescription for final hadronization .    from solutions of the hydrodynamical equations",
    "one gets the transverse momentum spectra for various species of particles , the radial and elliptic flows , the shape of the interaction region ( as revealed by bose - einstein correlations and hanburry brown - twiss interferometry ) .",
    "their comparison with experimental data allows to determine the main thermodynamical , statistical and mechanical properties of the quark - gluon medium .",
    "symbolically , their values found from 200 gev data can be grouped as @xmath527 mev ; @xmath528 mev ; @xmath529 mev ; @xmath530 fm ; @xmath531 fm ; @xmath532 gev/@xmath533 ; @xmath534 gev/@xmath533 ; @xmath535 gev/@xmath533 ; @xmath536 @xmath537 ; @xmath538 ( @xmath539 in ads / cft ) ; @xmath540 @xmath537 .",
    "these values show rapid thermalization , high average initial energy density and quite long `` lifetime '' of the quark - gluon plasma before hadronization at rather low energy density and temperature predicted by lattice qcd .",
    "complete thermalization in the time less than 1 fm is required to obtain the measured value of elliptic flow and its centrality dependence which is very sensitive to any deviation from local thermal equilibrium of low @xmath3 particles .",
    "collective excitations , resonances and inelastic collisions keep the system in thermal equilibrium . the good agreement of the data with ideal fluid dynamics points to a very small viscosity of qgp . other transport coefficients",
    "( shear , diffusion , heat conduction ) are not important if the microscale defined by rescattering is much less than the macroscale related to medium expansion .",
    "strong non - perturbative interaction should be responsible for its behavior as an ideal liquid .",
    "herefrom comes the name of strong quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) . in sqgp ,",
    "there may exist , e.g. , clusters @xcite and colored bound states of massive quasiparticles @xcite with heavier flavors .",
    "resonance scattering on constituents of the quark - gluon medium can become important @xcite .",
    "all that would give rise to its collective response with new scales discussed above , high pressure , large chromopermittivity and long - range correlations necessary to explain the enhancement of strange partons production by non - local processes .",
    "the long `` lifetime '' supports approximate description of energy losses within an `` infinite '' medium .",
    "hydrodynamics is an actively developing field nowadays .",
    "main characteristics of low @xmath3 particles have been described in this approach . at the same time many factors have to be taken into account such as thermodynamics , models of collective flows , hadronization process , resonance decays , chemical composition , geometry of collisions etc . however a fully consistent hydrodynamical description has not yet been found .",
    "some controversial conclusions appear from time to time about , e.g. , the energy ( from sps to rhic ) , rapidity and centrality dependence of elliptic flow , its absolute value , the transverse momentum dependence of various radii derived from hbt analysis , the chemical composition of some species ( e.g. , @xmath541 ratio ) etc .",
    "one may hope that they will be resolved in the near future within the same set of adjusted parameters . that would provide deeper understanding of collective thermodynamical and mechanical properties of the bulk matter and its evolution .",
    "first lhc experiments on pp interactions at 2.36 and 7 tev already showed that even the most general characteristics like inclusive pseudorapidity distributions in the central region @xmath542 for cms ( compact muon solenoid ) and @xmath543 for alice ( a large ion collider experiment ) are not well enough described by theoretical predictions . even though the qualitative features are reproduced , no monte carlo scheme ( among the four tried ) fits the results quantitatively .",
    "surely , more surprises are waiting for us in correlation studies , especially , in heavy - ion experiments .",
    "the energies of lhc open new possibilities for studies of the reviewed topics .",
    "the gluon - gluon processes will dominate . the formation length for radiation of gluons ( and photons ) becomes larger at higher energies .",
    "thus high energy partons will feel the finite size of the interaction region .",
    "the spectra of radiated gluons and photons are predicted to become harder due to oscillations of the light - cone wave function @xcite .",
    "the emission from heavy quarks should be enhanced by the finite - size effects relative to light quarks . in general , the relative roles of surface effects , initial high virtualities of created high-@xmath3 partons , dead - cone effect in radiation by heavy quarks will be elucidated .",
    "coherent final state interactions must become stronger .",
    "the smaller values of chromopermittivity for very high energy partons discussed above indicates on weaker coupling and lower parton density of the medium at lhc compared with rhic .",
    "therefore , the role of fluctuations induced by instabilities will be enhanced at lhc @xcite .    both trigger and",
    "non - trigger experiments are important in aa - collisions .",
    "following rhic in trigger experiments , the partons ( jets ) at large angles with much higher energies will be available .",
    "correspondingly , this allows to study jet quenching , ridge and double - humped events in wider energy intervals .",
    "in particular , the energy dependence of the chromopermittivity may be found by studying humps behavior in wider energy intervals .",
    "the humps shifts due to the wake effect in semi - central collisions and due to lorentz transformation of the chromopermittivity tensor in a wide energy interval are of a special interest",
    ".    in non - trigger experiments studies of the response of the quark - gluon medium to the extremely fast moving partons will be of primary importance",
    ". it would be quite instructive if the events similar to the cosmic ray one are observed .",
    "the finite - size effects are especially important for forward - moving partons with large @xmath65 .    the search for forward subjets with a fixed mass ( due to the transition radiation - eq .",
    "( [ she ] ) ) or fixed transverse momentum ( due to high energy cherenkov gluons - eq .",
    "( [ bunch ] ) ) might be fruitful .",
    "effects due to cherenkov gluons can be used to study the wide region of @xmath544-plane available at the lhc .",
    "the different values of parton densities would correspond to different subregions on this plane .",
    "the nonlinear effects described in section 4.5 may become more pronounced albeit still difficult to separate from main effect due to the possible dispersive behavior of the chromopermittivity .",
    "one can imagine more exotic experiments .",
    "for example , let triggers register a single electron ( positron ) which is produced in a process of the convolution of the quark - antiquark pair inverse to those studied at @xmath64-colliders .",
    "the dielectric permittivity can be measured and the formulae ( [ eed ] ) , ( [ eom ] ) compared with the data .",
    "even though the cross section is very small , it might be measurable in the high luminosity regime of lhc .",
    "the experimental studies at sps and , especially , the numerous and detailed data about heavy ion collisions at rhic provided us with invaluable information about the completely new field  the properties of the quark - gluon medium .",
    "they showed that aa events can not be described as an additive collection of pp collisions .",
    "the heavy ion dynamics must take into account the collective behavior of the medium .",
    "that is clearly demonstrated by anisotropic flows , jet quenching , such peculiar correlations as ridge and double - humped events etc .",
    "theoretical understanding of medium evolution asked for application of qcd at full strength to speculate about such stages as cgc , glasma , thermalization , qgp , hadronization .",
    "the specific configuration of fields in glasma and corollaries of deconfinement at qgp stage need further studies . in its turn ,",
    "experimental results required to revive the theoretical methods widely applied in the condensed matter physics .",
    "the modification of energy losses of partons in the medium because of the formation length effects and its collective response ( the chromopermittivity ) due to polarization are described in this manner .",
    "hydrodynamics was extensively exploited for description of collective behavior of this medium .",
    "both experimental and theoretical progress in this field are extremely fruitful and promising .",
