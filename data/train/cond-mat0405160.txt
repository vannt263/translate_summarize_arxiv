    "the description and understanding of electronic properties of strongly correlated materials is a very important and long standing problem for ab - initio calculations . widely used approximations for the exchange and correlation energy in density functional theory ( dft ) , mainly based on parametrization of ( nearly ) homogeneous electron gas , miss important features of their physical behavior .",
    "for instance both local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) and spin - polarized generalized gradient approximations ( @xmath1gga ) , in their several flavors , fail in predicting the insulating behavior of many simple transition metal oxides ( tmo ) , not only by severely underestimating their electronic band gap but , in most cases , producing a qualitatively wrong metallic ground state .",
    "tmos have represented for long time the most notable failure of dft . when the high - t@xmath2 superconductors entered the scene ( their parent materials are also strongly correlated systems ) the quest for new approaches that could describe accurately these systems by first principles received new impulse , and in the last fifteen years many methods were proposed in this direction . among these ,",
    "lda+u approach , first introduced by anisimov and coworkers @xcite , has allowed to study a large variety of strongly correlated compounds with considerable improvement with respect to lsda or @xmath1gga results .",
    "the successes of the method have led to further developments during the last decade which have produced very sophisticated theoretical approaches@xcite and efficient numerical techniques .",
    "the formal expression of lda+u energy functional is adapted from model hamiltonians ( hubbard model in particular ) that represent the `` natural '' theoretical framework to deal with strongly correlated materials . as in these models ,",
    "a small number of localized orbitals is selected and the electronic correlation associated to them is treated in a special way .",
    "the obtained results strongly depend on the definition of the localized orbitals and on the choice of the interaction parameters used in the calculation , that should be determined in an internally consistent with .",
    "this is not always done and a widespread but , in our opinion , unsatisfactory attitude is to determine the value of the electronic couplings by seeking a good agreement of the calculated properties with the experimental results in a semiempirical way .    in this work a critical reexamination of the lda+u approach is proposed , which starting from the formulation of anisimov and coworkers @xcite , and its further improvements @xcite , develops a simpler approximation .",
    "this is , in our opinion , the `` minimal '' extension of the usual approximate dft ( lda or gga ) schemes needed when atomic - like features are persistent in the solid environment .    in the central part of this work",
    "we describe a method , based on a linear response approach , to calculate in an internally consistent way  without aprioristic assumption about screening and/or basis set employed in the calculation  the interaction parameters entering the lda+u functional used . in this context",
    "our plane - wave pseudopotential ( pwpp ) implementation of the lda+u approach is presented and discussed in some details .",
    "we stress however that the proposed method is basis - set independent .    our methodology",
    "is then applied to the study of the electronic properties of some real materials , chosen as representative of `` normal '' ( bulk iron ) and correlated ( bulk cerium ) metals , as well as a few examples of strongly correlated systems ( iron oxide , nickel oxide and fayalite ) .",
    "in order to account explicitly for the on - site coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in mott insulators and not treated faithfully within lda , anisimov and coworkers @xcite correct the standard functional adding an on - site hubbard - like interaction , @xmath3 : @xmath4 & = & e_{lda}[n({\\bf r } ) ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & e_{hub}[\\{n^{i\\sigma}_{m}\\ } ] - e_{dc}[\\{n^{i\\sigma}\\}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the electronic density , and @xmath6 are the atomic - orbital occupations for the atom @xmath7 experiencing the `` hubbard '' term .",
    "the last term in the above equation is then subtracted in order to avoid double counting of the interactions contained both in @xmath3 and , in some average way , in @xmath8 . in this term",
    "the total , spin - projected , occupation of the localized manifold is used : @xmath9 .    in its original definition the functional",
    "defined in eq .",
    "[ simpleu ] was not invariant under rotation of the atomic - orbital basis set used to define the occupancies @xmath6 .",
    "a rotationally invariant formulation has then been introduced @xcite where the orbital dependence of @xmath3 is borrowed from atomic hartree - fock with renormalized slater integrals : @xmath10 & = &                      \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\{m\\},\\sigma , i}\\ { { \\langle}m , m''|v_{ee}|m',m'''{\\rangle}n^{i\\sigma}_{mm'}n^{i-\\sigma}_{m''m ' '' }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( { \\langle}m , m''|v_{ee}|m',m'''{\\rangle}\\nonumber \\\\ & & -   { \\langle}m , m''|v_{ee}|m''',m'{\\rangle } ) n^{i\\sigma}_{mm'}n^{i\\sigma}_{m''m ' '' } \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angular moment of the localized ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) electrons and @xmath15    the double - counting term @xmath16 is given by : @xmath17 & = & \\sum_{i } \\frac{u}{2}n^{i}(n^{i}-1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\sum_{i}\\frac{j}{2 } [ n^{i\\uparrow}(n^{i\\uparrow}-1)+n^{i\\downarrow } ( n^{i\\downarrow}-1 ) ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radial slater integrals @xmath18 are the parameters of the model ( @xmath19,@xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath13 electrons , while also @xmath22 must be specified for @xmath14 states ) and are usually re - expressed in terms of only two parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath23 , describing screened on - site coulomb and exchange interaction , @xmath24 by assuming atomic values for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ratios .    to obtain @xmath0 and @xmath23 , anisimov and coworkers @xcite propose to perform lmto calculations in supercells in which the occupation of the localized orbitals of one atom is constrained .",
    "the localized orbitals of all atoms in the supercell are decoupled from the remainder of the basis set .",
    "this makes the treatment of the local orbitals an atomic - like problem  making it easy to fix their occupation numbers  and allows to use janak theorem @xcite to identify the shift in the corresponding eigenvalue with the second - order derivative of the lda total energy with respect to orbital occupation .",
    "it has however the effect of leaving a rather artificial system to perform the screening , in particular when it is not completely intra - atomic . in elemental metallic iron , for instance , anisimov and gunnarsson @xcite showed that only half of the screening charge is contained in the wigner - seitz cell .",
    "this fact , in addition to a sizable error due to the atomic sphere approximation used @xcite , could be at the origin of the severe overestimation of the computed on - site coulomb interaction with respect to estimates based on comparison of spectroscopic data and model calculations@xcite .",
    "some aspects of currently used lda+u formulation , and in particular of the determination of the parameters entering the model , have been so far tied to the lmto approach .",
    "this is not a very pleasant situation and some efforts have been done recently @xcite to reformulate the method for different basis sets . here",
    "we want to elaborate further on these attempts and provide an internally consistent , basis - set independent , method for the calculation of the needed parameters .      in order to fully define",
    "how the approach works the first thing to do is to select the degrees of freedom on which  hubbard @xmath0 \" will operate and define the corresponding occupation matrix , @xmath27 .",
    "although it is usually straightforward to identify in a given system the atomic levels to be treated in a special way ( the @xmath13 electrons in transition metals and the @xmath14 ones in the rare earths and actinides series ) there is no unique or rigorous way to define occupation of localized atomic levels in a multi - atom system .",
    "equally legitimate choices for @xmath27 are @xmath28 projections on normalized atomic orbitals , or @xmath29 projections on wannier functions whenever the relevant orbitals give raise to isolated band manifolds , or @xmath30 mulliken population or @xmath31 integrated values in ( spherical ) regions around the atoms of the angular - momentum - decomposed charge densities . taking into account the arbitrariness in the definition of @xmath27 no particular significance should be attached to any of them ( or other that could be introduced ) and the usefulness and reliability of an approximate dft+u method ( adft+u ) , and of its more recent and involved evolutions like the adft+dmft method , should be judged from its ability to provide a correct physical picture of the systems under study irrespective of the details of the formulation , once all ingredients entering the calculation are determined consistently .",
    "all above mentioned definitions for the occupation matrices can be put in the generic form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the valence electronic wavefunction corresponding to the state ( @xmath34 ) with spin @xmath35 of the system and @xmath36 is the corresponding occupation number .",
    "the @xmath37 s are generalized projection operators on the localized - electron manifold that satisfy the following properties : @xmath38 in particular @xmath39 is the projector on the complete manifold of localized states associated with atom at site @xmath7 and therefore @xmath40 is the total localized - states occupation for site @xmath7 .",
    "orthogonality of projectors on different sites is _ not _ assumed .    in the applications discussed in this work we will define localized - level occupation matrices projecting on atomic pseudo - wavefunctions .",
    "the needed projector operators are therefore simply @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the valence atomic orbital with angular momentum component @xmath43 of the atom sitting at site @xmath7 ( the same wavefunctions are used for both spins ) . since we will be using ultrasoft pseudopotentials to describe valence - core interaction , all scalar products between crystal and atomic pseudo - wavefunctions",
    "are intended to include the usual s matrix describing orthogonality in presence of charge augmentation @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , other choices could be used as well and different definitions for the occupation matrices will require , in general , different values of the parameter entering the adft+u functional , as it has been pointed out recently also by pickett et al .",
    "@xcite where , for instance , the value of hubbard @xmath0 in feo shifts from 4.6 to 7.8 ev when atomic d - orbitals for fe@xmath44 ionic configuration are used instead of those of the neutral atom . in an early study @xcite",
    "the u parameter in la@xmath45cuo@xmath46 varies from 6.8 to 7.7 ev upon variation of the atomic sphere radius employed in the lmto calculation .",
    "as pointed out in these works it is not fruitful to compare numerical values of u obtained by different methods but rather comparison should be made between results of complete calculations .      in order to simplify our analysis and",
    "gaining a more transparent physical interpretation of the `` + u '' correction to standard adft functionals we concentrate on the main effect associated to on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "we thus neglect the important but somehow secondary effects associated to non sphericity of the electronic interaction and the proper treatment of magnetic interaction , that in the currently used rotational invariant method is dealt with assuming a screened hartree - fock form . @xcite .    we are therefore going to assume in the following that parameter @xmath23 describing these effects can be set to zero , or alternatively that its effects can be mimicked redefining the u parameter as @xmath47 , a practice that have been sometime used in the literature @xcite .",
    "the hubbard correction to the energy functional , eqs .",
    "[ ub1 ] and [ ub2 ] , greatly simplifies and reads : @xmath48 & = & e_{hub}[\\{n^{i}_{mm'}\\ } ] - e_{dc}[\\{n^{i}\\ } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{u}{2}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{m,\\sigma } \\{n_{mm}^{i\\sigma}-\\sum_{m'}n_{mm'}^{i\\sigma}n_{m'm}^{i\\sigma}\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{u}{2}\\sum_{i,\\sigma } tr[{\\bf n}^{i\\sigma}(1-{\\bf n}^{i\\sigma})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    choosing for the localized orbitals the representation that diagonalizes the occupation matrices @xmath49 with @xmath50 , the energy correction becomes @xmath51   & = & \\frac{u}{2}\\sum_{i,\\sigma } \\sum_{i } \\lambda^{i\\sigma}_i ( 1 -\\lambda^{i\\sigma}_i ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from where it appears clearly that the energy correction introduces a penalty , tuned by the value of the u parameter , for partial occupation of the localized orbitals and thus favors disproportionation in fully occupied ( @xmath52 ) or completely empty ( @xmath53 ) orbitals .",
    "this is the basic physical effect built in the adft+u functional and its meaning can be traced back to known deficiencies of lda or gga for atomic systems .",
    "an atom in contact with a reservoir of electrons can exchange integer numbers of particles with its environment .",
    "the intermediate situation with fractional number of electrons in this open atomic system is described not by a pure state wave function , but rather by a statistical mixture so that , for instance , the total energy of a system with @xmath54 electrons ( where n is an integer and @xmath55 ) is given by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the energies of the system corresponding to states with @xmath59 and @xmath60 particles respectively , while @xmath61 represents the statistical weight of the state with @xmath60 electrons .",
    "the total energy of this open atomic system is thus represented by a series of straight - line segments joining states corresponding to integer occupations of the atomic orbitals as depicted in fig .",
    "[ parab ] .",
    "the slope of the energy vs electron - number curve is instead piece - wise constant , with discontinuity for integer number of electrons , and corresponds to the electron affinity ( ionization potential ) of the n ( n+1 ) electron system .",
    "sketch of the total energy profile as a function of number of electrons in a generic atomic system in contact with a reservoir .",
    "the bottom curve is simply the difference between the other two ( the lda energy and the `` exact '' result for an open system ) . ]",
    "exact dft correctly reproduce this behavior @xcite , which is instead not well described by the lda or gga approach , which produces total energy with unphysical curvatures for non integer occupation and spurious minima in correspondence of fractional occupation of the orbital of the atomic system .",
    "this leads to serious problems when one consider the dissociation limit of hetero - polar molecules or an open - shell atom in front of a metallic surface @xcite , and is at the heart of the lda / gga failure in the description of strongly correlated systems@xcite .",
    "the unphysical curvature is associated basically to the incorrect treatment by lda or gga of the self - interaction of the partially occupied kohn - sham orbital that gives a non - linear contribution to the total energy with respect to orbital occupation ( with mainly a quadratic term coming from the hartree energy not canceled properly in the exchange - correlation term ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known @xcite that total energy differences between different states can be reproduced quite accurately by the lda ( or gga ) approach , if the occupation of the orbitals is _ constrained _ to assume integer values . as an alternative , we can recover the physical situation ( an approximately piece - wise linear total energy curve ) by adding a correction to the lda total energy which vanishes for integer number of electrons and eliminates the curvature of the lda energy profile in every interval with fractional occupation ( bottom curve of fig .",
    "[ parab ] ) .",
    "but this is exactly the kind of correction that is provided by eq .",
    "[ our1 ] if the numerical value of the parameter @xmath0 is set equal to the curvature of the lda ( gga ) energy profile .",
    "this clarifies the meaning of the interaction parameter @xmath0 as the ( unphysical ) curvature of the lda energy as a function of @xmath59 which is associated with the spurious self - interaction of the fractional electron injected into the system . from this analysis",
    "it is clear that the numerical value of @xmath0 will depend in general not only , as noted in the preceding section , on the definition adopted for the occupation matrices but also on the particular approximate exchange - correlation functional to be corrected , and should _ vanish _ if the exact dft functional were used .",
    "the situation is of course more complicated in solids where fractional occupations of the atomic orbitals can occur due to hybridization of the localized atomic - like orbitals with the crystal environment and the _ unphysical _ part of the curvature has to be extracted from the total lda / gga energy , which contains also hybridization effects . in the next section this problem",
    "is discussed and a linear response approach to evaluate hubbard @xmath0 is proposed .      following previous seminal works",
    "@xcite we compute @xmath0 by means of constrained - density - functional calculations @xcite .",
    "what we need is the total energy as a function of the localized - level occupations of the `` hubbard '' sites :    @xmath62 = \\min_{n({\\bf r}),\\alpha_i } \\left \\ {   e [ n({\\bf r } ) ] + \\sum_i \\alpha_i ( n_{i } - q_{i } ) \\right \\ } , \\ ] ]    where the constraints on the site occupations , @xmath63 s from eq .",
    "[ eq : ni ] , are applied employing the lagrange multipliers , @xmath64 s . from this dependence",
    "we can compute numerically the curvature of the total energy with respect to the variation , around the unconstrained values @xmath65 , of the occupation of one isolated site .",
    "a supercell approach is adopted in which occupation of one representative site in a sufficiently large supercell is changed leaving unchanged all other site occupations .",
    "this curvature contains the energy cost associated to the localization of an electron on the chosen site including all screening effects from the crystal environment , but it is not yet the hubbard @xmath0 we want to compute .",
    "in fact , had we computed the same quantity from the total energy of the non - interacting kohn - sham problem associated to the same system , @xmath66 = \\min_{n({\\bf r}),\\alpha_i } \\left\\ { e^{ks } [ n({\\bf r } ) ] +   \\sum_i \\alpha^{ks}_i ( n_i - q_i ) \\right \\},\\ ] ] we would have obtained a non vanishing results as well because by varying the site occupation a rehybridization of the localized orbitals with the other degrees of freedom is induced that gives rise to a non - linear change in the energy of the system .",
    "this curvature coming from rehybridization , originating from the non - interacting band structure but present also in the interacting case , has clearly nothing to do with the hubbard @xmath0 of the interacting system and should be subtracted from the total curvature : @xmath67}{\\partial q_i^{2 } } - \\frac{\\partial^{2}e^{ks}[\\{q_i\\}]}{\\partial q_i^{2 } } .\\ ] ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite anisimov and gunnarsson , in order to avoid dealing with the above mentioned non - interacting curvature , exploited the peculiarities of the lmto method , used in their calculation , and decoupled the chosen localized orbitals from the remainder of the crystal by suppressing in the lmto hamiltonian the corresponding hopping terms .",
    "this reduced the problem to the one of an isolated atom embedded in an artificially disconnected charge background .",
    "thanks to janak theorem @xcite the second order derivative of the total energy in eq .",
    "[ eq : eofn ] can then be recast as a first order derivative of the localized - level eigenvalue . in our approach",

    "@xcite , in our approach we need to compute and subtract the band - structure contribution , @xmath69 , from the total curvature , but , in return , hubbard @xmath0 is computed in exactly the same system to which it is going to be applied and the screening from the environment is more realistically included .",
    "the present method was inspired by the linear response scheme proposed by pickett and coworkers @xcite where however the role of the non - interacting curvature was not appreciated .",
    "in actual calculations constraining the localized orbital occupations is not very practical and it is easier to pass , via a legendre transform , to a representation where the independent variables are the @xmath64 s @xmath70 & = & \\min_{n({\\bf r } ) } \\left \\ { e [ n({\\bf r } ) ]    + \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\ ; n_{i } \\right\\ } , \\\\",

    "it is useful to introduce the ( interacting and non - interacting ) density response functions of the system with respect to these localized perturbations : @xmath74 using this response - function language , the effective interaction parameter @xmath0 associated to site @xmath7 can be recast as : @xmath75 that is reminiscent of the well known random - phase approximation @xcite in linear response theory giving the interacting density response in terms of the non - interacting one and the coulomb kernel .",
    "a similar result is obtained within dft linear response @xcite where the interaction kernel also contains an exchange - correlation part .",
    "the response functions , eq .  [ chidef ] , needed in eq .",
    "[ ueff1 ] are computed taking numerical derivatives .",
    "we perform a well converged lda calculation for the unconstrained system ( @xmath76 for all sites in the supercell ) and  starting from its self - consistent potential ",
    "we add small ( positive and negative ) potential shifts on each non equivalent `` hubbard '' site @xmath23 and compute the variation of the occupations , @xmath77 s , for all sites in the supercell in two ways : @xmath28 letting the kohn - sham potential of the system readjust self - consistently to optimally screen the localized perturbation , @xmath78 , and @xmath29 without allowing this screening .",
    "this latter result is nothing but the variation computed from the first iteration in the self - consistent cycle leading eventually to the former ( screened ) results .",
    "the site - occupation derivatives calculated according to @xmath28 and @xmath29 give the matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .      before moving to examine some specific examples in the next section ,",
    "let s end the present one discussing a few additional technical points .",
    "as mentioned earlier , hubbard @xmath0 is computed , ideally , from variation of the site occupation of a single site in an infinite crystal and in practice adopting a supercell approach where periodically repeated sites are perturbed coherently . in order to speed up the convergence of the computed @xmath0 with supercell size it may result useful to enforce",
    "explicitly charge neutrality for the perturbation , that is to be introduced in the response functions , thus enhancing its local character and reduce the interaction with its periodic images . in this procedure",
    "we introduce in the response functions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in addition to the degrees of freedom associated to the localized sites  also a `` delocalized background '' representing all other degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "this translates in one more column and row in the response matrices , whose elements are determined imposing overall charge neutrality of the perturbed system for all localized perturbations , ( @xmath83 ) and absence of any charge density variation upon perturbing the system with a constant potential ( @xmath84 ) . from a mathematical point of view",
    "both @xmath81 and @xmath85 acquire a null eigenvalue , corresponding to a constant potential shift , and the needed inversions in eq .",
    "[ ueff1 ] must be taken with care .",
    "it can be shown that their singularities cancel out when computing the difference @xmath86 and the final result is well defined .",
    "we stress that in the limit of infinitely large supercell the coupling with the background gives no contribution to the computed @xmath0 , but we found that this limit is approached more rapidly when this additional degrees of freedom is included .    in the same spirit we found that the spatial locality of the response matrices can be rather different from the one of their inverse and a supercell sufficient to decouple",
    "the periodically repeated response may be too small to describe correctly the inverse in eq .",
    "[ ueff1 ] . as a practical procedure ,",
    "therefore , after evaluating the response function matrices in a given supercell , we extrapolate the result to much larger supercells assuming that the most important matrix elements in @xmath85 and @xmath81 involve the atoms in the few nearest coordination - shells accessible in the original supercell .",
    "the corresponding matrix elements of the larger supercell are filled with the values extracted from the smaller one while all other , more distant , interactions are neglected .",
    "again , when a sufficiently large supercell to extract the matrix elements of the response functions is considered , the effect of this extrapolation vanishes , but , as we will see in the following , this scheme capture a large fraction of the system - size dependence of the calculated @xmath0 and it may allow to reach more rapidly the converged result .    as a final remark we notice that the electronic structure of a system described within the lda+u approach may largely differ from the one obtained within the lda used to compute @xmath0 .",
    "in a more refined approach one might seek internal consistency between the band structure used in the calculation of @xmath0 and the one obtained using it .",
    "we have not addressed this issue here , but one can imagine performing the same type of analysis leading to the @xmath0 determination for a functional already containing an lda+u correction . the computed @xmath0 would in that case be a correction to be added to the original @xmath0 and internal consistency would be reached when the correction vanishes .",
    "in their seminal paper anisimov and gunnarsson @xcite computed the effective on site coulomb interaction between the localized electrons in metallic fe and ce . for ce",
    "the calculated coulomb interaction was about 6 ev in good agreement with empirical and experimental estimates ranging from 5 to 7 ev @xcite , while the result for fe ( also about 6 ev ) was surprisingly high since @xmath0 was expected to be in the range of 1 - 2 ev for elemental transition metals , with the exception of ni @xcite .",
    "let us apply the present approach to these two system , starting with iron .",
    "in its ground state elemental iron has a ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin arrangement and a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure .",
    "gradient corrected exchange - correlation functional are needed in order to stabilize the experimental structure as compared with non - magnetic face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structure preferred by lda .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzherof ( pbe ) @xcite gga functional was employed here .",
    "iron ions were represented by ultrasoft pseudopotential and kinetic energy cutoffs of 35 ry and 420 ry were adopted for wavefunction and charge density fourier expansion .",
    "brillouin zone integrations where performed using 8@xmath878@xmath878 monkhorst and pack special point grids @xcite using methfessel and paxton smearing technique @xcite with a smearing width of 0.005 ry in order to smooth the fermi distribution .",
    "the calculation of the effective hubbard @xmath0 followed the procedure outlined in preceding section : a supercell was selected containing a number of inequivalent iron atoms ; then , after a well converged self - consistent calculation , we applied to one of these atoms small , positive and negative , potential shifts , @xmath88 ( with @xmath890.2 - 0.5 ev ) , where @xmath90 is the projector on the localized @xmath13 electron of the selected atom . from the variation of the @xmath13-level occupations of all iron atoms in the cell one column of @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath82 response functions was extracted and all other matrix elements were reconstructed by symmetry , including the background as explained previously .",
    "hubbard @xmath0 was then calculated from eq .",
    "[ ueff1 ] .    in order to describe response for an isolated perturbation four supercells",

    "the hubbard @xmath0 obtained from the sc 2-atom cell , once inserted in the 64-atom supercell , captures most of the effective interaction ; second nearest neighbors shell brings some significant corrections to the final extrapolated result , while third nearest neighbor shell has a smaller effect .",
    "we believe that contributions from further neighbor rapidly vanish and that an accurate value of @xmath0 can be extracted from the sc supercell containing 16 atoms . the extrapolation from this cell to larger cells brings only minor variations which are within the finite numerical accuracy that we estimate within a fraction of an ev . from this analysis",
    "our estimate for the hubbard @xmath0 in elemental iron at the experimental lattice parameter is therefore 2.2 @xmath91 0.2 ev .",

    "may appear counterintuitive , as correlation effects are expected to become less important when atoms gets closer , one should actually compare the increasing value of @xmath0 with the much steeper increase of bandwidth when reducing the interatomic distance .",
    "upon increase of the lattice parameter the hubbard parameter should approach the atomic limit that can be estimated from all - electron atomic calculations where the local neutrality of the metallic system is maintained : @xmath92 ev , in reasonable agreement with the results of fig .",
    "[ uls ] .    using the calculated volume dependent hubbard @xmath0 parameter",
    "we have studied the effect of the lda+u approximation on the structural properties of iron .    .",
    "comparison between the calculated lattice constant ( @xmath93 ) , bulk modulus ( @xmath94 ) and magnetic moment ( @xmath95 ) within several approximate dft schemes and experimental results quoted from @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : faystrut ]    although we did not studied other spin - configurations , magnetic properties seam to improve slightly in the gga+u approximation .",
    "the magnetic moment on each iron ( both fe1 and fe2 ) was found to be 3.9 @xmath96 , in closer agreement with the spin - only value ( 4 @xmath96 ) of the experimental result ( 4.4 @xmath96 ) than the one obtained by gga only ( 3.8 @xmath96 ) .",
    "this improvement is probably due to the enhanced atomic - like character of iron @xmath13 states , which is consequence of the gap opening .    in conclusion",
    ", the gga+u provides a quite good description of structural , magnetic _ and _ electronic properties of fayalite , reproducing the observed insulating behavior with a reasonable value for its fundamental band gap .",
    "in this work we have reexamined the lda+u approximation to dft and a simplified rotational - invariant form of the functional was adopted .",
    "we then developed a method , based on a linear response approach , to calculate in an internally consistent way the interaction parameters entering the lda+u functional , without making aprioristic assumption about screening and/or basis set employed in the calculation .",
    "our methodology was then successfully tested on a few systems representative of normal and correlated metals , simple transition metal oxides and iron silicates . in all cases we obtained rather accurate results indicating that our scheme allows us to study both electronic and structural properties of strongly correlated material on equal footing , without resorting to any empirical parameter adjustment .",
