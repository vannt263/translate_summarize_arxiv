    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) , which are thought to be among the oldest stellar objects in the universe , provide vitally important information regarding the minimum age of the universe and the early formation history of our galaxy .",
    "the most direct method for determining the age of a star cluster is main - sequence photometry , since the turn - off is mostly affected by age ( see * ? ? ?",

    "s312 , first detected by @xcite ( no.19 ) , then by @xcite ( no.312=s312 ) and @xcite ( no.379=bo379 ) , is among the first extragalactic globular clusters whose age was accurately estimated by main - sequence photometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) below the main - sequence turnoff for s312 using the extremely deep images of m31 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( hst ) .",
    "@xcite estimated an age of 10 gyr for s312 by the quantitative comparison to isochrones of @xcite .",

    "combined with photometry in nuv of _ galex _ , broad - band @xmath1 and infrared @xmath2 of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , we obtained the accurate seds of s312 in 17 filter bands from @xmath3 .    since the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "evolutionary population synthesis modelling has become a powerful tool to interpret integrated spectrophotometric observations of galaxies and their subcomponents , such as star clusters @xcite .",
    "the evolution of star clusters is usually modelled by means of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) approximation .",
    "an ssp is defined as a single generation of coeval stars formed from the same progenitor molecular cloud ( thus implying a single metallicity ) , and governed by a given initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "globular clusters , which are bright and easily identifiable , are typically characterized by homogeneous abundance and age distributions . for example , @xcite compared the predicted ssp colors of three stellar population synthesis models to the intrinsic broad - band @xmath12 colors of galactic and m31 gcs , and found that the best - fitting models match the clusters seds very well indeed .    in this paper , we constrain the age of s312 by comparing observational seds ( sect .",

    "observations of s312 were obtained by the batc 60/90 cm schmidt telescope located at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatory of china ( naoc ) .",

    "in this paper , for s312 , we adopted ccd @xmath16 photometry of @xcite , and photographic @xmath18 photometry of @xcite with a photometric uncertainty of 0.08 mag as suggested by @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the age - metallicity degeneracy in optical broad - band colors is @xmath19 , implying that the composite spectrum of an old stellar population is indistinguishable from that of a younger but more metal - rich population ( and vice versa ) ( also see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite also showed that the use of near - infrared colors can break the age - metallicity degeneracy . at the same time , as @xcite and @xcite indicated that near - infrared photometry is less sensitive to interstellar extinction with respect to the classical optical bands , it provides useful complementary information that can help to disentangle the age - metallicity degeneracy ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we add @xmath2 photometry from the 2mass point source catalogue ( psc ) to broad- and intermediate - band optical , and ultraviolet photometry to constrain the age of s312 to the highest possible accuracy .",
    "2mass presents @xmath21 and @xmath8 complete homogeneous photometry of 99.998 % of the sky down to @xmath22 ( completeness @xmath23 99 % for @xmath24 ) .",
    "the near - ultraviolet , broad - band and 2mass photometric data points of s312 are listed in table 2 .",
    "as a check on the age of s312 , and also on a check of our methodology , we compare its spectral energy distributions with theoretical stellar population synthesis models .",
    "we used the ssp models of @xcite ( hereafter bc03 ) , which have been upgraded from the @xcite version , and now provide the evolution of the spectra and photometric properties for a wider range of stellar metallicities . bc03",
    "provide 26 ssp models ( both of high and low resolution ) using the 1994 padova evolutionary tracks , 13 of which were computed using the @xcite imf assuming lower and upper mass cut - offs of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the other 13 were computed using the @xcite imf with the same mass cut - offs .",
    "in addition , bc03 provide 26 ssp models using the 2000 padova evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , as @xcite pointed out , the 2000 padova models , which include more recent input physics than the 1994 models , tend to produce worse agreement with observed galaxy colors .",
    "these ssp models contain 221 spectra describing the spectral evolution of ssps from @xmath27 yr to 20 gyr .",
    "the evolving spectra include the contribution of the stellar component at wavelengths from 91  to @xmath28 m . in this paper , we adopt the high - resolution ssp models computed using the 1994 padova evolutionary tracks and a @xcite imf . we note that although the current best constraint of the age of the universe is of order 13.7 gyr , the ssp models and the stellar evolutionary tracks that form their basis have been calculated for ages up to 20 gyr .",
    "it is not straightforward to correct for this discrepancy ; one would need to recalculate all stellar evolutionary tracks for all metallicities .    since our observational data are integrated luminosites through our set of filters , we convolved the bc03 ssp seds with the batc intermediate- , _ galex _ nuv- , broad - band @xmath1 and 2mass filter response curves to obtain synthetic ultraviolet , optical and near - infrared photometry for comparison .",
    "the synthetic @xmath29 filter magnitude can be computed as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the theoretical sed and @xmath32 the response curve of the @xmath33 filter of the batc , _ galex _ , @xmath1 and 2mass photometric systems . here",
    ", @xmath31 varies with age and metallicity .      to obtain the intrinsic seds of s312",
    ", the photometry must be dereddened .",
    "@xcite determined the reddening for each individual cluster using correlations between optical and infrared colours and metallicity and by defining various `` reddening - free '' parameters using their large database of multi - colour photometry .",
    "@xcite found that the m31 and galactic gc extinction laws , and the m31 and galactic gc colour - metallicity relations are similar to each other .",
    "they then estimated the reddening to m31 objects with spectroscopic data using the relation between intrinsic optical colours and metallicity for galactic clusters . for objects without spectroscopic data , they used the relationships between the reddening - free parameters and certain intrinsic colours based on the galactic gc data .",
    "@xcite compared their results with those in the literature and confirmed that their estimated reddening values are reasonable , and quantitatively consistent with previous determinations for gcs across the entire m31 disc .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that the distribution of reddening values as a function of position appears reasonable in that the objects with the smallest reddening are spread across the disk and halo , while the objects with the largest reddening are concentrated in the galactic disk .",
    "therefore , we adopted the reddening values from ( * ? ? ?",

    "the values of extinction coefficient @xmath35 are obtained by interpolating the interstellar extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "the seds for clusters are significantly affected by the adopted metallicity , especially for old clusters .",
    "so , only if the metallicity is known , the age of a cluster can be constrained accurately . @xcite",
    "derived metallicities for 150 m31 globular clusters including s312 , using the strengths of six absorption features in the cluster integrated spectra .",

    "@xcite used @xmath37 wfpc2 photometry to construct deep color - magnitude diagrams for s312 , and the shape of the red giant branch gave an iron abundance of @xmath38=-0.53 $ ] . in this paper , we adopt for comparison @xmath38=-0.53 $ ] as @xcite did .      before constraining the age of s312",
    ", we compare the age scale between the padova 1994 evolutionary tracks @xcite used by bc03 and the 2006 vandenberg isochrones @xcite used in @xcite .",
    "as an example , we only draw the isochrones with 10 gyr and the solar metallicity .",
    "figure 2 shows the isochrones between effective temperaure and bolometric magnitudes .",
    "it is clear that the matching is very good in the main sequence ( ms ) and the subgiant branch ( sgb ) . as we know , the main - sequence photometry focuses on the upper end of the ms and sgb , since uncertainties in models of stars on the red giant branch ( rgb ) are large .",
    "so , if @xcite had fitted the color - magnitude diagram ( cdm ) of s312 with the padova 1994 evolutionary tracks , its age would have been close to 10 gyr .",

    "spectra for other metallicities can be obtained by linear interpolation of the appropriate spectra for any of these metallicities . for s312 ,",
    "whose metallicity and reddening values were published by other authors , the cluster age is the sole parameter to be estimated ( for a given imf and extinction law , which we assume to be universal ) . in figure 3",
    ", we show the intrinsic seds of s312 , the integrated seds of the best - fitting model , and the spectra of the best - fitting model superimposed the 3-sigma spectra .",
    "the best reduced @xmath39 of 18.23 is achieved with an age of @xmath4  gyr , which is in very good agreement with the previous determination ( 10 gyr ) of @xcite by main - sequence photometry . from figure 3 , we can see that , the 3-sigma spectra deviate clearly from best - fitting ones , i.e. these three spectra clearly separate .",
    "this indicates that we can constrain the age of s312 with errors of about 3 gyr .",
    "star cluster masses can be estimated by comparing the measured luminosity in @xmath55 band with the theoretical mass - to - light ratios .",
    "these ratios are a function of the cluster age and metallicity .",
    "bc03 calculated these ratios for a range of metallicities .",

    "based on its present luminosity , @xmath57 mag and the extinction , @xmath58 , its intrinsic luminosity is @xmath59 mag [ assuming the @xcite galactic reddening law ; @xmath60 mag ] . from this , we determine the mass of s312 to be @xmath61 . comparing with 037-b327 [ @xmath62 m@xmath63 @xcite or @xmath64 m@xmath63 @xcite ] and g1 [ @xmath65 m@xmath63 @xcite ] in m31 and @xmath66 cen [ @xmath67m@xmath63 @xcite ] in the milky way , the most massive clusters in the local group",

    "provide two sets of ssp models based on the 1994 and 2000 padova evolutionary tracks , respectively . in section 3.4",
    ", we adopted the ssp models based on the 1994 padova evolutionary tracks to constrain the age of s312 .",
    "however , it is interesting to show what the best fit is based on the 2000 padova models . using the 2000 padova models",
    ", we fitted the intrinsic seds of s312 again , it is surprised that the fitting is very good with the best reduced @xmath39 of 9.71 , but , the age of @xmath68  gyr is older than 10 gyr of @xcite by main - sequence photometry . in figure 4",
    ", we plot the intrinsic seds of s312 , the integrated seds of the best - fitting model and the spectra of the best - fitting model superimposed the 3-sigma spectra based on the 2000 padova evolutionary tracks .",
    "this figure also showed that , the 3-sigma spectra deviate from best - fitting ones much .",
    "as things stand now , without having other clusters to compare , there is a problem that an sed - fitting based on the older isochrones ( the 1994 padova ) constrains the age of s312 in agreement with the main - sequence turnoff fit , while the newer isochrones ( the 2000 padova ) give an older age constraint of s312 . these are therefore issues that one needs to keep in mind in the context of more recent input physical parameters of the 2000 padova evolutionary tracks as indicated by @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite have illustrated the influence of the stellar evolution prescription on the predicted photometric evolution of an ssp for solar metallicity as an example in their figure 2 , which showed models computed using the 1994 padova , the geneva and the 2000 padova evolutionary tracks . from figure 2 of @xcite",
    ", we can see that , at late ages , the @xmath69 color is significantly bluer in the 2000 padova model than in the 1994 padova model .",
    "the reason for this is that the giant - branch temperature in the 2000 padova tracks has not been tested against observational calibrations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "so , it is certain that an sed - fitting based on the 2000 padova model gives an older age for s312 than the age we obtained from the 1994 @xcite models .",
    "in section 3.4 , we constrain the age of s312 based on the integrated photometric measurements in _ galex _ nuv , broad - band @xmath1 , 9 intermediate - band filters of batc and infrared @xmath2 of 2mass .",
    "these photometries constitute the accurate seds of s312 from @xmath3 . in order to constrain the age of s312 accurately , we use as many photometric data points covering as large a wavelength range as possible . in this section ,",
    "we investigate which passbands actually constrain the age .",
    "the results show that , except for nuv , a lack of any band does not result in great problems in constraining the age of s312 , the dispersions in the recovered age are smaller than 0.5 gyr .",
    "the reason may be that , for s312 , whose metallicity and reddening values were published by other authors , the cluster age is the sole parameter to be constrained .",
    "if we constrain the age and metallicity of s312 simultaneously , the importance of the @xmath18 or @xmath70 will appear . as @xcite pointed out that , the age deviations from the input values for the combinations without the @xmath18 or @xmath70 bands are caused by an insufficiently accurate determination of the cluster metallicity , i.e. the @xmath18 or @xmath70 plays a major role in determining the metallicity .",
    "missing @xmath18 or @xmath70-band information leads to underestimates of metallicity , thereby causing ages to be adjusted improperly .",
    "the results also show that , a lack of nuv results in problems in constraining the age of s312 , the dispersion in the recovered age is 2.5 gyr , which reflects that the nuv flux point shows promise of being useful determination of age . a lack of all bands bluer than @xmath55 or of all bands redder than @xmath71 results in great problems in constraining the age of s312 , the dispersions in the recovered age are 4.25 or 7.25 gyr , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we constrain the age of the m31 globular cluster s312 by comparing its multicolor photometry with theoretical stellar population synthesis models .",
    "this is both a check on previous results , and a check on our methodology of applying age constraints via our seds of stellar systems .",
    "multicolor photometric data are from _ galex _ nuv , broadband @xmath1 , 9 intermediate - band filters and 2mass @xmath2 , which constitute the seds covering @xmath3 .",
    "our result is in very good agreement with the previous determination ( 10 gyr ) of @xcite @xmath72 main - sequence photometry .",
    "we also estimate the mass of s312 , which shows that it is a medium - mass globular cluster in m31 .",
    "since no other clusters can be available to confirm our seds - fitting method of constraining ages of globular clusters , a large sample of globular clusters , whose ages are derived based on our seds - fitting method , may boost confidence in the dataset and in our seds - fitting method .",
    "@xcite obtain age constraints for 91 m31 globular clusters , based on the same sources of photometric data ( not including _ galex _ nuv ) , the same theoretical stellar synthesis models and the same fitting methods .",
    "figure 5 shows a plot of age errors ( 1@xmath73 spread ) as a function of age based on the data of @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the absolute age errors increase significantly with increasing age , and derived ages with errors of @xmath74 gyr are available for ages younger than 9 gyr .",
    "@xcite argue for peaks in the age distribution at @xmath75 3 and 8 gyr , in addition to the expected complement of milky way - like `` old '' globular clusters .",
    "while their results have considerable scatter , they show a noticeable lack of young , metal - poor globular clusters , or old and very metal - rich globular clusters , which might be consistent with an age metallicity relationship .    at the same time",
    ", the results of this paper also indicate that , despite having such good multicolor photometry , we still can not get solid age constraints from seds fitting even with nuv to @xmath8 photometry .",
