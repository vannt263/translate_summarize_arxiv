    "the gaussian self  consistent ( gsc ) method represents a quite general , albeit relatively simple , theoretical framework for studying the equilibrium , dynamics and kinetics of conformational changes in polymer solutions .",
    "one of its most attractive features is that it can be applied to virtually any type of heteropolymer @xcite , with any specific interaction terms involving e.g.  chain stiffness @xcite or charges @xcite .",
    "the connectivity of the chain can be arbitrary : an open polymer @xcite , a ring @xcite , a star @xcite , or a dendrimer @xcite , whether in the limit of a single chain @xcite or at finite concentrations @xcite .",
    "moreover , not only the radius of gyration of the polymer or the total density can be computed , but much finer details of the conformational structure , such as the mean  squared distances between monomers or radial distributions at a given time , are available .",
    "such a versatility naturally comes at the cost of certain limitations and inaccuracies intrinsic to the technique . however , these are well known and manageable , although often largely overstated in the popular view .",
    "some of these , such as the gaussian shape of the radial distribution function ( rdf ) , are quite unavoidable at the level of the gsc theory , but others , such as the traditional use of the edwards virial expansion @xcite , can indeed be surpassed as we shall demonstrate in the current work .",
    "this would permit us for the first time to compare observables between the predictions of the gsc technique and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation in continuous space based on the same model for given values of thermodynamic parameters throughout the range of the coil  to  globule transition .",
    "historically , perhaps the first of the equilibrium versions of the gaussian method in application to a single homopolymer chain were independently proposed by s.  edwards _ et al _ @xcite and j.  des cloizeaux @xcite .",
    "the approach of the work by edwards @xcite relied on the following idea .",
    "one would like to approximate the coordinates of the real homopolymer chain , @xmath0 , governed by the gibbs distribution with the exact hamiltonian @xmath1 , via a ` trial ' gaussian chain with the monomer positions @xmath2 , governed by a simpler trial hamiltonian @xmath3 . by assuming that the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 are small and hence by applying the taylor expansion to the equilibrium gibbs averages , in the first order",
    ", one requires that the mean  squared radius of gyration obeys , @xmath6 such a theory predicts the correct mean  field swelling exponent @xmath7 for the repulsive coil , only missing the subtle renormalisation group correction .",
    "it also gives appropriately @xmath8 for the ideal coil , and @xmath9 for the globule .",
    "moreover , this approach can be further extended to kinetics by considering time dependent analogues of eq .",
    "( [ edwards ] ) @xcite .    a seemingly more refined theory proposed by des cloizeaux @xcite uses @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the degree of polymerisation ) variational variables @xmath12 , which are the normal modes of the monomer positions for a ring chain @xmath13 .",
    "this technique is based on the standard gibbs ",
    "bogoliubov variational principle with a quadratic diagonal trial hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "the equilibrium corresponds to the minimum of the trial free energy , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the free energy associated with @xmath3 .",
    "expressed in the edwards form the extremum conditions for the trial free energy are precisely the following @xmath10 equations , @xmath16 unfortunately , this theory , although more accurate for polymers around the theta  point and indeed for the globule , is known to have a deficiency in that it predicts the exponent @xmath17 instead of the mean  field value of @xmath7 for the swollen coil in the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 . for this reason ,",
    "some suspicion arose concerning the validity of the theory by des  cloizeaux , hampering further efforts in this direction .",
    "it should be emphasised , however , that for finite values of @xmath11 the resulting theory does give quite reasonable numerical results fairly close to @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the numerically fitted value of the swelling exponent tends to be somewhere in between the two above theoretical predictions . in a way ,",
    "this is not an unusual situation , even for the more elaborate integral equations theories of molecular fluids used in attempts to deduce the flory exponent @xcite .",
    "more importantly , this well known deficiency of the theory by des  cloizeaux becomes irrelevant when considering the theta  point or the poor solvent conditions .",
    "therefore , activity on further extending and improving the gsc theory has persisted , notably in milan by g.  allegra and f.  ganazzoli _ et al _ , in saclay by h.  orland and t.  garel _ et al _ @xcite , as well as in our group in dublin @xcite , and some collaborations between these have emerged @xcite .",
    "furthermore , extensions of the gsc theory to kinetics , as well as to essentially any polymeric system , have been also achieved . for the former end ,",
    "one proceeds from the langevin equation and approximates the exact stochastic ensemble via a linear trial one .",
    "we refer the reader to our papers in refs . for the ultimate formulation of the gsc theory in terms of the real space variables .",
    "such a version of the gsc method avoids the limitations of the earlier normal modes formulations since it can distinguish the frustrated states of heteropolymers with spontaneously broken kinematic symmetries associated with the connectivity structure .    despite the relative success of the most recent form of the gsc method ,",
    "the theoretical situation is not as yet fully satisfactory and further efforts along these lines are required .",
    "firstly , one would like to be able to use the actual molecular interaction parameters rather than the coefficients in the edwards virial expansion , which are somewhat obscure in their meaning .",
    "secondly , the convergence of such a virial expansion in the dense liquid globular state is rather problematic , being at best that of an asymptotic series .",
    "thirdly , despite the conventional view , the three  body term is unable by itself to fully withstand a catastrophic pair ",
    "wise collapse of monomers onto each other in the attractive regime for heteropolymers . in refs .",
    "ad hoc _ self  interaction energy term has been added to tackle this problem , but it is merely a tweak of the model . finally , the effective three  body and higher order virial terms make the current theory numerically inefficient due to a scaling law involving a high power in @xmath11 for the time expense per step , despite the fact that the original model only contains two  body interactions .",
    "therefore , in the current work we shall rid ourselves of relying on the virial representation of the hamiltonian entirely .",
    "indeed , the exact molecular two  body potential can be averaged over the gaussian rdf directly .",
    "however , the gaussian function does not vanish at the origin , yielding a divergence from the repulsive part of the lennard ",
    "jones pair  wise potential .",
    "one simple alternative is to use the latter potential with a hard core part , as in ref . , in which case one has to cut off the integration at the hard sphere diameter , or more generally , within the excluded volume area .    to include the effect of the hard sphere repulsion one can in principle use any of the standard reference techniques developed for the hard sphere liquids , e.g. the percus ",
    "yevick expression for rdf , or the carnahan  starling ( cs ) free energy formula @xcite .",
    "we prefer to use the latter due to its practical simplicity and accuracy when compared to molecular simulations .",
    "the carnahan  starling equation , which was originally derived for a single component hard sphere liquid , has been naturally extended to mixtures .",
    "it is quite popular in the liquid matter literature at present ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "its extension to polymeric fluids is somewhat less obvious though .",
    "here we propose to express the partial packing coefficient for each of the monomers via an integral of the gaussian trial rdf over the excluded volume area .",
    "the resulting gsc equations involve well tractable , albeit somewhat more complicated than before , expressions , since they now depend on the exact shapes of the molecular potentials .",
    "although we shall present the resulting technique in its most general form , which is applicable to any type of polymeric system , our numerical analysis in this work will be restricted by homopolymers of three different architectures  ring , open and star  across the coil  to  globule transition .",
    "this is done to enable us to make a comparison of the results from the present gsc theory with the mc data obtained in our previous paper in ref . .",
    "the current coarse  grained polymer model is based on the following hamiltonian ( energy functional ) @xcite in terms of the monomer coordinates , @xmath19 : @xmath20 here the first term represents the connectivity structure of the polymer with harmonic springs of a given strength @xmath21 , introduced between any pair of connected monomers ( which is denoted by @xmath22 ) .",
    "the second term represents the bending energy penalty given by the square of the local curvature with a characteristic stiffness @xmath23 between any three consecutively connected monomers ( which is denoted by @xmath24 ) in the form of the kratky  harris  hearst .",
    "below we shall prefer to rewrite the first two terms in the following equivalent form , @xmath25 finally , the third and fourth terms represent pair  wise non  bonded interactions between monomers such as the van der waals and coulomb forces .",
    "we can adopt the lennard ",
    "jones form of the former potential , @xmath26 where there is also a hard core part with the monomer radii @xmath27 , and where @xmath28 are the dimensionless strengths of the interactions .",
    "the coulomb interaction potential similarly is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the debye screening length , @xmath31 is the dielectric permittivity of vacuum , @xmath32 are the charges , and @xmath33 is the bjerrum length .",
    "the main objects in the gsc method are the mean  squared distances between monomers , @xmath34 note that our convention includes the factor of @xmath35 here and hence in the later definition of the mean  squared radius of gyration according to the tradition .",
    "this allows us to rid of such factors from the radial distribution function ( rdf ) and numerous averages over it .",
    "the gsc method is based on replacing the stochastic ensemble for @xmath0 with the exact hamiltonian in the langevin equation of motion onto the trial ensemble @xmath36 with a trial hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "the latter is taken as a generic quadratic form with the matrix coefficients , which are called the time ",
    "dependent effective potentials , @xmath38 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{ij } v_{ij } ( t)\\ , { \\bf x}_i ( t)\\ , { \\bf x}_{j } ( t).\\ ] ] then one requires that the inter ",
    "monomer correlations satisfy the condition , @xmath39 which means that the trial ensemble well approximates the exact one as far as monomer correlations are concerned .",
    "this procedure yields expressions for the effective potentials via the instantaneous mean energy , @xmath40 } { \\partial { \\cal d}_{ij}(t ) } , \\label{gsc : effv}\\ ] ] and hence the mean  squared distances themselves satisfy the self ",
    "consistent equations @xcite .",
    "these , in the absence of the hydrodynamic interaction , are simply , @xmath41}{\\partial { \\cal d}_{ik}(t)}- \\frac{\\partial { \\cal a}[{\\cal d}(t)]}{\\partial { \\cal d}_{jk}(t ) } \\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath42 is the friction coefficient of a monomer , and the instantaneous free energy has the same functional expression via the instantaneous @xmath43 as it has at equilibrium .",
    "extension to the preaveraged hydrodynamic approximation is quite straightforward also and it is discussed in ref . .",
    "the stationary limit of these equations produces the equations for the minimum of the free energy , which are the same as those derived from the gibbs ",
    "bogoliubov variational principle with a generic quadratic trial hamiltonian .",
    "although in this paper we shall only be concerned with the equilibrium properties , the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinmain ] ) , applied until the stationary limit is reached , presents by far the most efficient technique for finding the global free energy minimum .",
    "this , based on the fifth order adaptive step runge ",
    "kutta integrator @xcite , was used for obtaining the results from the gsc technique in this work .",
    "it should be also noted that the systems studied here possess a large number of kinematic symmetries for @xmath44 , and hence for @xmath45 , matrices coming from their symmetricity and from the equivalence of any monomer in a ring , or any arm in a star homopolymers .",
    "thus , the computational expenses per step in our calculations are of order @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the total number of independent elements in the matrix @xmath44 .",
    "these symmetries significantly reduce the computational times compared to mc for an equivalent system , where such symmetries only appear in the observables after averaging over the statistical ensemble . for comparison ,",
    "the computational expenses per step in mc are of order @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of mc steps needed to ensure a good statistical independence between measurements , and where @xmath50 is the number of measurements needed for sampling of observables .",
    "typical values of @xmath50 should be of order of @xmath51 for a good accuracy in the present case @xcite . moreover , kinetic iteration of the gsc equations towards the equilibrium is also significantly faster than the equivalent equilibration procedure in the mc .",
    "for example , for a ring polymer of @xmath52 units in the good solvent , @xmath53 , the gsc method turns out to be @xmath54 times faster @xcite than mc for gaining the same data , whereas for an open chain of the same length , which possesses much fewer kinematic symmetries , gsc is @xmath55 times faster than mc .",
    "carnahan and starling have devised a simple but rather accurate equation of state for hard sphere liquids @xcite in terms of the packing coefficient @xmath56 , yielding the following free energy , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the volumes of the hard sphere and of the whole system respectively .",
    "this is obtained from an interpolation formula for the virial coefficients based on several of them known exactly ( see more detailed discussions in e.g. ref . ) .    to extend these ideas to polymeric fluids",
    ", we would have to distinguish the packing coefficients for individual monomers . in eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) we can write @xmath60 ; the volume of the sphere @xmath58 is equal to the @xmath61-th of its excluded volume ; and the inverse volume is equal to the rdf of the ideal reference system , @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we can similarly express the packing coefficient for the @xmath63-th monomer as a sum over all other monomers of the @xmath61-th of the integral over the excluded volume of the monomer @xmath63 of the rdf for the gaussian reference system , @xmath64 yielding finally , @xmath65 one may note that the gaussian distribution does not possess a well defined volume beyond which it vanishes .",
    "thus , to account for this we can , in principle , include a multiplicative parameter @xmath66 , which should be once and for all chosen to match the data best , but this should , in any case , be fairly close to the unity . therefore , the total hard sphere contribution will be , @xmath67      the total mean energy includes both the bonded and the pair  wise non  bonded interactions via , @xmath68 \\right).\\ ] ] note that here we integrate only beyond the excluded volume as the hard sphere contribution will be included explicitly via the carnahan  starling term .",

    "[ tab:1 ] have a significantly larger discrepancy between gsc and mc .",
    "the gsc theory noticeably underestimates the negative lennard  jones energy contribution between all pairs of monomers .",
    "this , however , is to be expected given that the shape of rdf from mc @xcite has a very tall first liquid  like peak ( see the inset of fig .  [ fig : rdf ] ) .",
    "since the lennard  jones interaction is rather short  ranged , the first peak gives a predominant negative contribution to the mean energy in eq .",
    "[ energy ] . as the gsc theory has merely an effective smooth ` interpolating ' gaussoid in @xmath109 in that area ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : rdf ] ) , the resulting negative energy contribution is significantly smaller in such a theory",
    ".    we can also remark that the scaling for the swelling exponent in the globule is correct in the gsc theory .",
    "indeed , the maximal compression is reached when @xmath127 , therefore by considering @xmath128 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : etai],[eq : y],[eq : fy ] ) we indeed obtain , @xmath129 .    next , we would like to look at the plots of the mean  squared radius of gyration , @xmath91 , and of the mean energy , @xmath84 across the coil  to  globule transition .",
    "these are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : rgcollapse ] and [ fig : ecollapse ] respectively .",
    "the following points can be made .",
    "first of all , the shapes of these curves are quite similar for mc and gsc with both values of @xmath66 .",
    "secondly , the coil  to  globule transition is continuous in all three cases , with the energy slope changing noticeably at around the theta  point .",
    "thirdly , the transition occurs at a somewhat higher value of the attraction constant @xmath130 in the gsc theory than in the mc simulation .",
    "this can be explained by the underestimation of the lennard ",
    "jones attraction energy in the globule discussed above .",
    "lastly , @xmath91 of the globule is partly overestimated by the gsc method with @xmath131 , since the value @xmath125 is much closer to the point of the coil  to  globule transition for the theory with @xmath131 than that with @xmath89 or mc .    finally , to understand the @xmath11-dependence of the coil  to  globule transition in fig .",
    "[ fig : cap ] we present the plots of the specific energy slope , @xmath132 , vs @xmath130 for the flexible rings of different sizes .",
    "these curves nearly coincide in the repulsive coil region , starting to diverge from a value of @xmath133 .",
    "the region of the transition , where the quantity @xmath132 experiences the most dramatic drop , becomes increasingly narrower with increasing polymer size @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , since the magnitude of the overall change in the specific energy slope also increases with @xmath11 , the coil  to  globule transition becomes ` sharper ' with @xmath11 in the gsc theory , consistent with the mc simulation data and the transition being of second order @xcite .",
    "note also , that the theta  point , which we may define e.g. as the point of the maximal change in @xmath132 , shifts towards lower values of @xmath130 with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we have developed a version of the gaussian self  consistent ( gsc ) technique which does not rely on the virial  type expansion of the hamiltonian in terms of powers of the density , @xmath134 . as a result",
    ", it is now possible to apply the new method to practically any polymer model involving conventional molecular interactions .",
    "thus , we have been able to compare the mean spatial characteristics and the energy values between the results from the gsc theory and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation based on precisely the same model , which includes the harmonic bonded and the lennard ",
    "jones pair  wise interactions .",
    "this comparison has been performed for three types of macromolecular architectures of an isolated chain : a ring , an open polymer , and a star .",
    "we have done this also across the range of the coil  to  globule transition , as well as for different degrees of polymerisation and degrees of flexibility .",
    "naturally , the gsc theory agrees with the second order nature of the coil  to  globule transition for flexible homopolymers .",
    "importantly , the speed of numeric computation is much faster @xcite in the gsc method than in the equivalent mc simulation for obtaining the same data , particularly so for systems possessing an extra kinematic symmetry , such as for rings or stars .",
    "overall , the agreement in the shapes of the curves and many of the particular numerical values of observables between gsc and mc is better than one could have anticipated given the relative simplicity of the gsc technique .",
    "where any significant level of deviation does occur , it has been identified as either related to the correlation hole effect at small separations , or to the stretched gaussian behaviour at large separations , in the radial distribution function ( rdf ) @xcite",
    ".    in particular , for the repulsive coil , the energy and the mean  squared distances between near monomers along the chain are quite accurate in the gsc theory as compared to the mc data ( with a typical deviation of several percent ) , but the distances between remote monomers , and hence the radius of gyration , are overestimated by the gsc method ( with a typical deviation of a few dozen percent ) .",
    "this is a well known drawback of such a theory , related to the overestimation of the flory swelling exponent for long chains , due to the fact that the rdf here does not have a stretched exponential behaviour at large separations . on the contrary , for a rather stiff coil",
    ", the gsc theory underestimates the radius of gyration .",
    "this may be due to shortcomings of the hard sphere carnahan  starling term .",
    "for the collapsed globule , on the other hand , the distances and the radius of gyration are quite accurate in the gsc theory , although the mean energy is less so because of the lack of a sharp liquid  like peak in the rdf .",
    "to make the agreement of gsc and mc better , one has to finally overcome the most restrictive feature of the method  the gaussian shape of rdf itself .",
    "one possible way of doing this is to take a linear superposition of the gaussian trial functions , thereby permitting ` stretching ' of the gaussoid .",
    "this should be sufficient for curing the problem with the swelling exponent of the repulsive coil in the gsc theory .",
    "work along these lines is currently in progress .",
    "the main difficulties in doing this are in the considerable mathematical complications when calculating the non  gaussian conformational entropy of the chain , as well as in the added numerical complexity , since a radial mesh for rdf would have to be introduced .",
    "nevertheless , we intend to resolve these issues and hope to present a more accurate , and at last a non  gaussian self  consistent theory in the near future .",
