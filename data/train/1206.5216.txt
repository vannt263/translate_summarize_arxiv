    "the standard model ( sm ) gauge group is _ a priori _ consistent with a large flavor group that is not observed experimentally and yukawa couplings and mixings are introduced to comply with such experimental evidence  @xcite .",
    "however , the pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles and the nature of the neutrino mass ( whether dirac or majorana ) is not constrained by the gauge symmetry and it is thus natural to go beyond the sm to seek for a theoretical explanation of the observed masses and angles and of their hierarchies . to date a promising direction towards the understanding of flavor physics in the sm  notably of fermion mass matrices and mixing  has been the study of particular textures ( in the quark sector ) , such as the nearest neighbor interactions ( nni ) texture  @xcite and the fritzsch type textures  @xcite , and the introduction of flavor symmetry groups that constrain the structure of the fermion mass matrix to reproduce the desired texture .",
    "the mixing in the lepton sector has also given strong support to the idea of an underlying flavor symmetry and many flavor symmetry groups have been proposed so far  @xcite ; of them discrete groups have proved to be quite successful and we keep exploring such direction in the present work .",
    "although the aforementioned approach , involving ( discrete ) flavor groups , provides a possible description of the pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles , it seems not to be able to explain the hierarchy(ies ) among the different species of fermionic masses .",
    "i.e. , the flavor symmetry explains the number and location of the `` zeros '' in the textures for the fermion mass matrices , but not the relative size among the non - zero entries .",
    "in other words it appears that , in order to obtain experimentally suitable values for such physical quantities , one needs to allow for parameters of quite different order of magnitude .",
    "such hierarchy problems have proved to be quite hard , in the framework of four - dimensional non - supersymmetric theories . on the other hand in the context of extra - dimensions , several models  with flat or warped extra - dimensions  were proposed as solutions to hierarchy problems , mostly focusing on the gauge - gravity hierarchy .",
    "in particular the randall - sundrum model 1 ( rs1 )  @xcite has drawn a great deal of attention as it provides a possible description of the tev - planck hierarchy with a small ( planck size ) extra - dimension and treats the tev scale as a derived scale .",
    "the geometry of such space is a slice of five - dimensional anti - de sitter space , a warped product between four - dimensional space , and an extra dimension with the topology of an interval whose extrema are the fixed points of a @xmath1 orbifold symmetry .",
    "the space thus `` ends '' on two flat four - dimensional planes ( branes ) located at the extrema of the extra dimension .",
    "extra - dimensional models , especially randall - sundrum models , have also been explored in the context of the sm physics as fermion masses might be explained in terms of the overlaps between the extra - dimensional profiles of fermions and higgs(es )  @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to consider the possibility of merging both scenarios  flavor symmetries and hierarchy from extra dimensional settings  in a single setup and to determine if a viable model can be constructed .",
    "this work presents one such case . to do this",
    "we use a minimally - extended version of the sm that incorporates a discrete flavor group , and that reproduces fermion mass patterns as well as mixing angles in both the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "the model is minimal in the sense that it contains the sm matter fields only ( in particular , it does not add right - handed neutrinos ) , an extended higgs sector composed of two higgs su(2 ) doublets , a lepton number violating scalar , and the smallest abelian group that renders the nni textures for the quark mass matrices , namely the cyclic group @xmath0 .",
    "the model is detailed in the forthcoming section , however let us stress here that such approach was already taken by other groups .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , a realization of the so - called lepton minimal flavor violation scenario was obtained in the framework of rs with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "there it was found that the first kaluza - klein ( kk ) mass scale could be as low as @xmath2  tev . along similar lines , but for the quark sector and providing a solution to the issue of flavor changing neutral currents in extra dimensional settings , the work in  @xcite extends the strong sector in the bulk with an additional su(3 ) , broken down to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) by boundary conditions that render the model safe , even for a kk scale of @xmath3  tev .",
    "closer to our approach is the work by kadosh and pallante  @xcite , where an @xmath4 flavor symmetry is introduced in a rs setup .",
    "the main difference with our model is that , unlike  @xcite , we use a flavor group that reproduces the mixing matrices in both the quark and lepton sectors automatically , without the need of introducing additional flavon fields to generate non - zero entries and/or further suppressions .",
    "this makes our model more economical in terms of additional fields and more tractable , specially in the scalar sector .",
    "another important difference is that in our model neutrino masses are generated radiatively and there is no need to introduce right - handed neutrinos , as mentioned above .",
    "the gauge and yukawa sectors of our model are presented in section  [ sec : model ] , where the expressions for the mass matrices in both the lepton and quark sectors are described and explicitly shown .",
    "section  [ sec : numerical ] shows the numerical analysis and results for both sectors and some remarks about the scalar potential and flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "finally we present the conclusions .",
    "an appendix has been included in order to maintain the discussion in the paper self contained .",
    "the five - dimensional field theory we consider is a higher - dimensional extension of the sm and lives in the rs1 background .",
    "such space is a slice of ads@xmath5 space of planck - size curvature , where the fifth dimension @xmath6 is taken to be an orbifolded circle @xmath7 of radius @xmath8 , and fields are odd or even under the action of the orbifold , i.e. under reflection @xmath9 . in other words",
    "the extra dimension has the topology of a line that stretches between @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the latter are fixed points of the orbifold , where two flat 3-branes , one with positive and the other with negative tension , are accommodated .",
    "the brane located at @xmath10 is referred to as the `` uv brane '' , whereas the brane located at @xmath11 is referred to as the `` ir brane '' .",
    "the bulk line element is thus given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 being ( proportional to ) the ads curvature , and the tev - planck hierarchy is realized provided @xmath14 .",
    "such geometry is realized with a negative bulk cosmological constant and with the aforementioned brane tensions : all three are of planck size . moreover , all the fields we deal with have vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of order at most tev , and we may thus neglect their backreaction to the geometry  .    the five - dimensional model we consider has a gauge - symmetry group that includes the standard model custodial symmetry @xmath15 in order to suppress excessive contributions to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath16 parameter  @xcite , augmented with a discrete abelian group @xmath0 , hence @xmath17",
    ". all the fields of our model are charged under @xmath0 and , with the exception of the higgs fields , are all bulk fields , along the lines of what is done in  @xcite .",
    "this setup thus enjoys a very nice interpretation in terms of ads / cft correspondence as only the higgs fields are seen as tev - scale composites of the strongly - coupled sector of the four - dimensional theory and , since all other fields are bulk fields , all the phenomenology of the model is addressable from the weakly - coupled five - dimensional model .",
    "the matter content of the model involves ( three families of ) left - handed quark doublets @xmath18 and lepton doublets @xmath19 along with two copies of right - handed quark doublets , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and one copy of right - handed lepton doublets , @xmath22 ; the zero - modes of `` tilded '' fields will be projected out from the ir brane by scherk - schwarz gauge - symmetry breaking  @xcite and only their kk modes are eventually non - zero on the brane .",
    "we then use two higgs fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 that are bi - doublets of @xmath25 and are confined to the ir brane .",
    "lastly , we introduce a bulk singlet scalar field @xmath26 charged under hypercharge and lepton number that participates in neutrino mass generation .",
    "the @xmath0 charge assignment for all such fields is similar to the one given in  @xcite , namely @xmath27 for the quark sector , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 for the lepton sector , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for the scalars with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the main difference with  @xcite is that the left - handed up - type and down - type quarks have the same @xmath0 charges ; the reason is dictated by the fact that we are using higgs bi - doublets confined on the ir brane .",
    "these fields transform as @xmath37 under @xmath38 gauge transformations ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are the pauli matrices ) and , as explained later , are responsible for the spontaneous breaking of @xmath41 on the ir brane . in other words",
    "the vevs of @xmath42 are @xmath43 singlets @xmath44 \\label{eq : vev}\\ ] ] so that @xmath45 > , with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 thus enter on equal footing in the yukawa lagrangian and must then have the same @xmath0 charges .",
    "it is easy to check that   is invariant under the diagonal part of @xmath38 , namely @xmath49 and thus preserves @xmath43 .",
    "the bulk ( custodial ) gauge symmetry must be broken down to the sm gauge group on the four - dimensional effective action at tev scale and usual electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking must also be accounted for .",
    "we realize this in the same way as in  @xcite by orbifold scherk - schwarz projection , i.e. by assigning independent orbifold charges to a field at the two different ends of the interval , and with canonical spontaneous breaking .",
    "we can impose on the bulk fields a @xmath50 charge assignment . for scalar fields",
    "this corresponds to the field transformations @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 being the fixed points of @xmath50 . for 5d spinors , single valuedness of the lagrangian upon",
    "the action of @xmath54 requires @xmath55 we can fix @xmath56 and decompose the 5d 4-spinor as @xmath57 with @xmath58 being left - handed ( right - handed ) weyl spinors , in the 4d sense . at the fixed points ,",
    "i.e. setting @xmath10 in  , we thus have that the left - handed weyl spinor @xmath59 has charges @xmath60 and the corresponding right - handed weyl spinor @xmath61 has charges @xmath62   charges , we will indicate the charges associated to the left - handed part of the doublet . ] .",
    "below we mostly only care about the extra - dimensional zero - modes , whose profiles are summarized in appendix  [ appendix : profiles ] .",
    "we thus have that the fermion left - handed zero mode   only exists for charges @xmath63 whereas the right - handed zero mode exists for @xmath64 .",
    "in other words , other non - trivial orbifold projections lift the mass of the zero - mode . for vector fields ,",
    "whose would - be zero - modes are constant , we again have that only @xmath63 allows for massless zero modes and other charge assignments lift the mass and thus realize the low - energy symmetry breaking .",
    "in our model we break @xmath65 gauge symmetry down to @xmath66 on the uv brane via scherk - schwarz mechanism , i.e. we assign @xmath67 to the electrically charged vector bosons of @xmath65 , and @xmath63 to the neutral gauge boson .",
    "since the former couple the upper and lower parts of the right - handed fermion doublets , single - valuedness of the bulk lagrangian requires that if the upper part is even , on the uv brane , the lower part must be odd and viceversa .",
    "hence , in order to have zero - modes for both the upper and lower parts of the right - handed quarks , we need to double the number of right - handed fields  @xcite in the quark sector , as already mentioned above . the charge assignment for such fields thus reads @xmath68\\,,\\qquad u_{ri } = \\left(\\begin{array}{l } u_{ri}[-,-]\\\\ \\tilde d_i[+,- ] \\end{array}\\right ) \\,,\\qquad d_{ri } = \\left(\\begin{array}{l } \\tilde u_{i}[+,-]\\\\ d_{ri}[-,-]\\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] for the quark sector , and @xmath69\\,,\\qquad e_{ri } = \\left(\\begin{array}{l } \\tilde \\nu_{i}[+,-]\\\\ e_{ri}[-,-]\\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] for the leptonic sector .",
    "a vev on the uv brane then provides the breaking @xmath70  @xcite .    on the ir brane",
    "the vevs of the higgs bi - doublets provide the spontaneous breaking @xmath71 .",
    "hence finally the superposition of all such breakings only leaves @xmath72 untouched .",
    "in fact @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the generators of @xmath43 ( above the tensor product is left implied . )",
    "the mass terms for the quarks come from the following yukawa interactions on the ir brane @xmath75 + h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the planck - scale and @xmath77 are dimensionless parameters assumed of @xmath78 that , together with the quark extradimensional profiles , generate the effective four - dimensional yukawa couplings .",
    "the @xmath0 charge assignments for the quark and scalar fields then induce the desired yukawa nni textures ( writing separately each scalar contribution ) @xmath79 which after electroweak symmetry breaking lead to the following quark mass matrices @xmath80 with @xmath81 denoting the vevs .",
    "the @xmath82 are the effective four - dimensional yukawa couplings that depend on the fermion extradimensional profiles overlap with the higgs bi - doublets at the ir boundary .",
    "thus , under the zero mode approximation ( zma ) ( see appendix for the kk decomposition and the explicit fermion profiles ) , each of the yukawa terms above looks like @xmath83[e^{2\\pi kr(1/2-c_{rj}^{q})}-1]}}e^{(1-c_{li}^{q}-c_{rj}^{q})\\pi kr } \\right\\}\\bar{q}_{li}^{(0)}(x)\\phi(x)q_{rj}^{(0)}(x ) , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , @xmath87 are family indices accordingly chosen ( note also the inclusion of a canonically - normalizing factor for the higgs bi - doublet ) .",

    ", we follow the harayama parametrization in reference @xcite , which is a transformation of the up  and down  type quark mass matrices to a basis such that these display the nni form without modifying the mass eigenvalues nor the ckm matrix entries .",
    "once parametrized in that form and following  @xcite , we make the assumption that the @xmath94 and @xmath95 entries in @xmath96 are equal leading to @xmath97 where @xmath98 are free parameters and @xmath99 with @xmath100 @xmath101 are real matrices arising from the phase factorization of @xmath96 @xmath102 with @xmath103 being diagonal phase matrices such that @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "depending on which solution we choose we have two different regions for the mathematically allowed values of @xmath118 and @xmath127 , region i ( plus case ) and ii ( minus case ) respectively .",

    "since there are no right - handed neutrinos present in the model , neutrino masses are generated radiatively   parameters , in contradiction to the philosophy of the general scenario .",
    "we therefore stick to the 4d renormalizable argument in  @xcite and consider the radiative mechanism . ] as in  @xcite . in the present extradimensional setting this mechanism is going to set two of the lepton @xmath129-parameters .",
    "as can be noted in the next section , their values turn out to be @xmath78 , as any localization @xmath88   parameter must be .",
    "the radiative mechanism introduces a cubic lepton number violating scalar interaction among the two su(2)@xmath130 doublets and the charged scalar @xmath26 , as well as the zee operator coupling the left - handed lepton doublet to the singlet charged scalar  @xcite .",

    "we find that the gauge and flavor invariant contributions , denoted by @xmath241 , to the zero entries in the mass matrices satisfy @xmath242 , where the @xmath243 denote the values of the non - zero entries . for the case @xmath244 ,",
    "corresponding to contributions to the non - zero entries , we find @xmath245 .",
    "thus , these contributions can be safely ignored .    before concluding we make some remarks to be taken in full consideration in a future work .",
    "our model has a potentially interesting scalar phenomenology that requires a complete study , including its vacuum stability and possible collider signals .",
    "another important and related phenomenological issue is the presence of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) effects . in our model",
    "there are two different possible contributions to fcnc that must be taken into consideration .",
    "the first one comes from the fact that we are dealing with a two ( flavored ) higgs doublet model in which each higgs couples to both the up and down quark sector .",
    "this can result in tree - level fcnc  @xcite that need to be analyzed and will induce constraints on the parameter space in the scalar potential .",
    "the second possibility is associated to the presence of mixing between the degrees of freedom of the effective 4d theory and their kk excitations .",
    "this is a problem that all extra dimensions models have to face .",
    "one has to guarantee that the corrections induced by this mixing will keep the agreement with observations forcing a lower bound , of order a few tev , on the kk scale . in our model",
    ", the use of a custodial symmetry allows to consider a lower bound on the first kk mass to that imposed by electroweak precision measurements  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore if the flavor pattern of the yukawa couplings holds in the 5d theory due to a flavor symmetry , an increased alignment between the 4d fermion mass matrix and the yukawa and gauge couplings is obtained suppressing the amount of flavor violation induced by the interactions with kk states . moreover , as pointed out in  @xcite , a bulk flavor symmetry might also induce a cancellation of observable phases , therefore the dominant new physics contributions to the neutron and electron dipole moments and/or to @xmath246 will vanish .",
    "a five - dimensional warped extension of the standard model is considered , where the space - time background is taken to be the randall - sundrum model 1 , i.e. a warped extra - dimension of planck size in an anti - de sitter bulk .",
    "we consider a zero - mode approximation for the four - dimensional effective action one obtains as a dimensional reduction of the higher - dimensional theory and that , in the present case , constitutes an extension of the sm . in the model we study above almost all the fields in the 4d effective action are zero modes of bulk fields , in particular each left- respectively right - handed fermion mode has its five - dimensional counterpart ; only the higgs fields are purely four - dimensional and live on the ir brane ( i.e. on the 4d plane located at the orbifold fixed point @xmath11 ) and , unlike the bulk fields , have no kk excitations .",
    "bulk fermion fields come about with a ( planck size ) mass term parametrized by a real number @xmath88 which determines the shape of the extra - dimensional profile of the field .",
    "the yukawa interaction between higgses and fermions is given in terms of overlapping integrals of zero - mode profiles for the fields involved and thus depends upon the aforementioned @xmath88 real parameters along with numerical coupling constant ( hermitian ) matrices @xmath233 s . in order to obtain a nni - type quark mass matrix",
    ", we advocate the presence of a discrete symmetry upon which all fields are charged : the cyclic group @xmath0 is the smallest abelian group consistent with the aforementioned texture .",
    "also for the charged lepton sector the discrete symmetry fixes the form of mass matrix in a similar way as for the quark sector . for the quark sector",
    "( and similarly for the charged lepton sector ) the numerical analysis goes as follows : first we consider the mass matrix parametrized _  la _ harayama in order for it to display nni form .",
    "the diagonalization of the real squared counterpart of the previous mass matrix leaves four parameters that can be fixed using the experimental values for the ckm . in turn , this allows to fix the entries of the mass matrix itself and , by comparison of such entries with the ones foreseen by the overlaps of extra - dimensional profiles , one can obtain the compactification parameters @xmath88 s and the yukawa dimensionless entries @xmath233  s . all these parameters turn out to be of @xmath247 . for the charged leptons the parametrization goes slightly different and",
    "the ( real ) mass matrix depends upon two free parameters only constrained by the reality of the mass matrix : allowed parameter regions satisfying such constraints , as well as all experimental data , are graphically displayed . in the neutrino sector we choose not to introduce right - handed neutrinos in the model and generate neutrino masses radiatively .",
    "this is accomplished with the help of a bulk charged scalar field whose zero - mode is peaked on the uv brane ( located at the fixed point @xmath10 ) : such field also mediates the lepton number violation . with scalar field masses chosen to be @xmath248  tev for the charged higgses in the loops , and @xmath181  tev ,",
    "experimental data taken from @xmath165 global neutrino data analysis and daya bay results are matched by setting all @xmath88 parameters and @xmath233 parameters to values of @xmath247 .",
    "although a complete phenomenological study of the model is under preparation , some comments regarding the scalar phenomenology of the model as well as its possible contributions to fcnc were also briefly discussed .",
    "we briefly review the computation of zero - mode profiles for some bulk fields , on the rs1 background considered above ; we basically follow what is done in  @xcite . a bulk field satisfies a second order differential equation of the form @xmath249 \\phi(x , y)=0   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 ; note that compared to  @xcite s we redefined @xmath253 for the right - handed mode . above @xmath254 and thus @xmath255 and @xmath256 $ ] . upon kaluza - klein decomposition one",
