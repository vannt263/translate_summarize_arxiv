    "asteroid families are born out of collisions .",
    "they `` die '' when the fragments formed in the collisional event disperse so far because of gravitational or non - gravitational forces that the family is no longer recognizable as a group .",
    "the time needed to disperse small groups has been the subject of several studies ( from our group , see for instance carruba et al . 2010a , 2011 , and 2015 ) .",
    "less attention has been given to the dispersion of larger families .",
    "recent studies ( brasil et al . 2015 ) suggested that no family could have likely survived the late heavy bombardment ( lhb hereafter , at least 3.8 gyr ago ) , in the jumping jupiter scenario , which set an upper limit on the maximum possible age of any asteroid family . in this work",
    "we focus our attention on the families whose estimated age , according to bro et al . (",
    "2013 ) could possibly date from just after the lhb , and whose existence , if confirmed , could provide precious clues on the early stages of our solar system .",
    "bro et al .",
    "( 2013 ) identified 12 families whose age estimate might have been compatible with an origin during the lhb , or just after : the maria , eunomia , koronis , themis , hygiea , meliboea , ursula , fringilla , alauda , sylvia , camilla , and hermione families .",
    "the sylvia family and the proposed long - lost groups around camilla and hermione in the cybele region were recently studied in carruba et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and will not be treated in detail here .",
    "that work found that , while all asteroids in the cybele region were most likely lost during the jumping jupiter phase of the model of planetary migration of nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , some of the largest fragments ( @xmath0  km , with d the body diameter ) of a hypothetical post - lhb sylvia family may have remained in the cybele region , but the identification of these groups could be difficult . due to local dynamics , any camilla and hermione families would disperse in time - scales of the order of 1.5 gyr .",
    "the fringilla family is a rather small group ( 134 members , according to nesvorn et al .",
    "2015 ) in the outer main belt .",
    "since we are already studying the larger themis , meliboea , alauda and ursula families in the outer main belt , and since the group is not large enough for the techniques used in this work , we will not further investigate this family in this paper .",
    "the hygiea family was studied at length in carruba et al .",
    "( 2014a ) , that found a maximum possible age of 3.6 gyr , just a bit younger than the minimum currently believed epoch of the last stages of the lhb , i.e. , 3.8 gyr ( bottke et al . 2012 ; also the age of the hygiea family should be most likely younger than 3.6 gyr , because of the long - term effect of close encounters with 10 hygiea and of the stochastic yorp effect of bottke et al .",
    "2015 , this last effect not considered in carruba et al .",
    "age estimates for the other families listed in bro et al .",
    "( 2013 ) are however known with substantial uncertainty , and were obtained before bottke et al .",
    "( 2015 ) modeled the so - called stochastic yorp effect , in which the shapes of asteroids changes between yorp cycles , and whose effect is generally to reduce the estimates of the given asteroid family age . understanding which , if any , of the proposed `` bro seven '' oldest groups ( maria , eunomia , koronis , themis , meliboea , ursula , alauda ) could have survived since the lhb , and how , is the main goal of this work .",
    "this paper is so divided : in sect .",
    "[ sec : fam_ide ] we identified the seven `` bro '' families in a new space of proper elements and sdss - moc4 @xmath1 slope and @xmath2 colors , and use the method of yarkovsky isolines to obtain estimates of maximum possible ages of these groups . in sect .",
    "[ sec : chron ] we use monte carlo methods ( see carruba et al .",
    "2015 ) to obtain refined estimates of the family age and ejection velocity parameters of the same families . sect .",
    "[ sec : dyn_old ] deals with the dynamical evolution and dispersion times of fictitious simulated `` bro '' groups since the latest phases of the late heavy bombardment , when the stochastic yorp effect ( bottke et al . 2015 ) and past changes in the solar luminosity ( carruba et al .",
    "2015 ) are accounted for .",
    "finally , in the last section , we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to obtain age estimates of the seven bro families , we first need to obtain good memberships of these groups .",
    "any method used should aim to reduce the number of possible interlopers , objects that may be part of the dynamical family , but have taxonomical properties inconsistent with that of the majority of the members .",
    "demeo and carry ( 2013 ) recently introduced a new classification method , based on the bus - demeo taxonomic system , that employs sloan digital sky survey - moving object catalog data , fourth release ( sdss - moc4 hereafter , ivezi et al . 2002 ) @xmath1 slope and z -i colors . in that article",
    "the authors used the photometric data obtained in the five filters @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , from 0.3 to 1.0 @xmath5 , to obtain values of @xmath6 colors and spectral slopes over the @xmath7 , and @xmath8 reflectance values , that were then used to assign to each asteroid a likely spectral type . since the authors were interested in dealing with a complete sample , they limited their analysis to asteroids with absolute magnitude @xmath9 higher than 15.3 , which roughly corresponds to asteroids with diameters larger than 5  km , and for which the sdss - moc4 data - set is supposed to be complete . since carruba et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed that the vast majority of asteroids that could survive 3.8 gyr of dynamical evolution in the post - lhb scenario should have diameters larger than 5 km , we believe that this choice of limit in @xmath9 could also be suitable for this research . for completeness , we also included asteroids with @xmath10 with known spectral types from the planetary data system ( neese 2010 ) that are not part of sdss - moc4 .",
    "these objects were assigned values of the @xmath1 slope and @xmath2 colors at the center of the range of those of each given class .",

    "we assigned families to their regions , defined as in bro et al .",
    "( 2013 ) as the central main belt , the pristine region , the outer main belt and the outer highly inclined region , and compute proper elements and @xmath1 slope and @xmath2 colors for all asteroids in each given region .",
    "we then computed nominal distance cutoff and stalactite diagrams with the standard techniques described in carruba ( 2010b ) , for all the seven bro families , and then assigned values of diameters and geometric albedos from the wise catalog ( wright et al .",
    "2010 ) to family members for which this information is available ( other objects were assigned the values of geometric albedo of the largest object in the family , and diameters computed using equation 1 in carruba et al . 2003 ) .",
    "finally the method of the yarkovsky isolines ( see also carruba et al .",
    "2013 ) is applied to obtain an estimate of the maximum possible age of each given family . in the next subsection",
    "we will discuss in detail the method for families in the outer main belt , results are similar for other regions .",
    "the outer main belt is defined in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) as the region between the 7j:-3a and 2j:-1a mean - motion resonances and @xmath29 .",
    "three possible old c - complex families have been proposed in this region : the themis , meliboea , and ursula groups .",
    "we identified 5472 asteroids with either taxonomical or sdss - moc4 information in the area , 3524 of which with data in the wise data - set , and 2896 ( 82.2% ) with @xmath30 .",
    "the value of the minimal distance cutoff @xmath31 was of 157.5  m / s and the minimal number of objects to have a group statistically significant was 25 .",
    "[ fig : meliboea ] , panel a , displays a stalactite diagram for this region .",

    "137 meliboea merges with the local background at @xmath32  m / s .",
    "the family of 375 ursula merges with eos at cutoff of 250 m / s , and with other minor groups at @xmath33  m / s , so we choose to work with a cutoff of 220 m / s .",

    "finally , we also apply the method of yarkovsky isolines ( carruba et al .",
    "2013 ) to the themis , meliboea , and ursula families , using standard values of the parameters of this force for c - type groups from bro et al .",

    "[ fig : iso_themis ] for the themis family .",
    "the red and blue lines are the expected displacement of family members over 3.8 and 4.6 gyr because of the yarkovsky effect and close encounters with massive asteroids , assumed equal to 0.01  au for simplicity ( carruba et al .",
    "all asteroids were assumed to be initially at the family barycenter .",

    "this does not necessarily mean that all paleo - families should be characterized by a shallow sfd .",
    "the initial sfd could have been much steeper , and collisionary evolution could have replenished the population of asteroids at smaller sizes .",
    "there are indeed some indications that some potential paleo - families , such as itha , could be characterized by a relatively steep sfd ( bro et al .",
    "however , dynamical effects alone indeed tend to remove smaller size bodies and to produce families with shallower sfd . in regimes where dynamical effects are prodominant and the initial sfd was not too steep",
    ", we would expect paleo - families to be characterized by a shallow sfd .",
    "also , according to the values of @xmath31 found in this work , only the synthetic koronis , maria , and possibly eunomia family would be recognizable , with some difficulties , with respect to the background ( typical values of @xmath31 depends on the local density of asteroids , but are usually of the order of 50 - 60 m / s ) . to help visualize the difference between a completely dispersed family , such alauda , and a relatively well preserved one , such maria",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter_alauda_maria ] a projection in the @xmath34 of the outcome of our simulations at @xmath39  gyr . while only a handful of the largest members of alauda survived up to this time , the simulated maria family , while dispersed , could still be recognizable in this domain .",
    "can any paleo - family still be observable today ?",
    "as we discussed , paleo - families would be difficult to recognize with traditional methods such as hcm , being characterized by a shallow sfd , a significant depletion in small family members ( those less than 5 km in diameter ) , and a large spread among the surviving members .",
    "paleo - families belonging to fairly typical taxonomical classes , such as c- and s - type , would be extremely hard to recognize .",
    "it was however proposed that v - type asteroids in the eunomia orbital region could have been fragments of a paleo - eunomia family associated with the disruption of eunomia parent body crust ( carruba et al .",
    "2007 , 2014b ) .",
    "we checked the @xmath38 value of the 16 v - type photometric candidates sfd currently in the eunomia orbital region ( defined according to our box criteria ) , and we found a value of 1.95 .",
    "while this result should be considered with caution , given the limited number of v - type asteroids in the region and possible limitations caused by observational incompleteness , the very shallow sfd of these objects suggests , in our opinion , that an origin from a paleo - eunomia family is not incompatible with the results of this work .",
    "in this work we :    * identified members of the seven old `` bro '' families in a new domain of proper elements , @xmath1 slope and @xmath6 colors .",

    "( 2015 ) and past changes in values of the solar luminosity to obtain refined estimates of the family ages , when possible .",
    "our nominal age estimates are lower than results of other groups that did not consider the stochastic yorp effect , as expected , but compatible to within the uncertainties . even allowing for the maximum possible value in the thermal conductivity of the simulated families",
    ", no cx - complex group could have a nominal age dating from the latest phases of the lhb .",
    "* simulated with the @xmath41 symplectic integrators ( carruba et al .",

    "any `` paleo - family '' that formed between 2.7 and 3.8  gyr ago would be characterized by a very shallow size - frequency distribution , a depletion in smallest ( @xmath43 km ) members , and a significant spread among the surviving fragments .",
    "only families in dynamically less active regions , such as the koronis family in the pristine zone of the main belt , could have potentially partially survived 3.8  gyr of dynamical evolution and not be completely dynamically eroded .",
    "the v - type asteroids in the eunomia orbital region are characterized by a very shallow sfd , and could potentially be compatible with a paleo - eunomia family , as suggested in the past ( carruba et al .",
    "2007 , 2014b ) .",
    "overall , the main result of this work is that some paleo - families , particularly the initially most numerous ones , or those in dynamically less active parts of the main belt , could still be visible today , but would be of rather difficult identification , especially for the case of families belonging to fairly typical taxonomical types , such as the c- and s - types .",

    "2003 ) , secular dynamics involving massive asteroids ( novakovi et al .",
    "2015 ) could all have contributed to further disperse paleo - family members , perhaps beyond recognition .",
    "yet the quest for the identification of a paleo - family remain , in our opinion , a very worthy subject of research in asteroid dynamics . if such family could be found , such as is possibly the case for the v - type asteroids in the eunomia orbital region , it could provide precious clues about a very early stage of our solar system .",
