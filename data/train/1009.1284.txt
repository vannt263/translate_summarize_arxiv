    "a quantum system @xmath0 interacting weakly with its environment @xmath1 can be treated as an open quantum system : standard techniques can be applied to obtain a master equation involving the degrees of freedom of @xmath0 , only . on a long time - scale determined by the weakness of the coupling to the environment ,",
    "the reduced dynamics consists of a semigroup of trace - preserving completely positive maps on the states of @xmath0 .",
    "these maps are fully consistent transformations of the system @xmath0 states incorporating the dissipative and noisy effects due to the environment @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "an irreversible reduced dynamics typically transforms pure states into mixed states , thus spoiling fundamental quantum resources like entanglement  @xcite .",
    "however , the markovian reduced dynamics resulting from suitably engineered environments may entangle an initial separable state of a bipartite quantum system immersed within it ; such an entanglement can even persist asymptotically  @xcite .    the properties of the asymptotic states of quantum dynamical semigroups can be studied by looking at the structure of the generator of the reduced dynamics  @xcite : some concrete applications can be found in  @xcite .",
    "most of the results present in the literature concern pairs of open qubits ; in the following , we will instead consider three qubits weakly interacting with a common environment such that the resulting master equation affects all possible pairs of qubits in the same way .",
    "in this case , the manifold of stationary states can partially be analytically characterized as well as the asymptotics of a particular class of initial states .",
    "we shall use the analytically obtained results to construct the following protocol : given two qubits immersed in the just depicted environment , 1 ) we add a third completely depolarized qubit , 2 ) leave the three of them irreversibly evolve until they reach the stationary state , 3 ) trace away the ancilla . as an indication of the surprises set in store by higher dimensional entanglement with respect to the two qubit case ,",
    "we show that , for certain initial two - qubit states , the entanglement obtainable by such a procedure is larger than that achievable by simply letting them reach the stationary state within the bath .",
    "in the following we shall study an open quantum system of three qubits in weak interaction with their environment @xmath1 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath2 the algebra of @xmath3 matrices @xmath4 and by @xmath5 the positive matrices of trace @xmath6 that describe the states of @xmath0 and by @xmath7 the convex set of all states .",

    "we shall then set @xmath147 so that @xmath234 and let @xmath238 as calculated in appendix b , equation  ( [ b7 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath239 , all initial states @xmath153 with @xmath240 correspond to asymptotic states @xmath152 which are separable , but to reduced asymptotic states @xmath241 in  ( [ thestates3 ] ) that are entangled .",
    "the same occurs for @xmath242 for initial states @xmath153 with @xmath243 .",
    "therefore , there are separable states @xmath153 which do not get asymptotically entangled by direct immersion in the environment described by  ( [ me2 ] ) , but do get entangled if a third depolarized qubit is appended to them and then eliminated after reaching stationarity .",
    "this phenomenon is numerically confirmed in the following figure where the concurrence of @xmath241 is plotted for @xmath244 and @xmath245 .     when @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248,width=226 ]    * remark 4.*admittedly , the range of favorable values of the environment dependent parameter @xmath147 is not so large , as well as the range of separable two - qubit states @xmath153 that can get entangled by means of the protocol and not by direct immersion in the environment .",
    "however , the fact that such a possibility exists is an indication of what might be achievable if one could completely characterize the whole manifold of stationary three - qubit states . also , instead of tracing away the third qubit",
    ", one could perform a less mixing operation on it in such a way that some more entanglement be localized on the remaining two qubits : preliminary results confirm this possibility , but , unfortunately , not to a sufficiently significative extent .",
    "luckily , concerning the second two points listed at the end of section 3.3 , addition of a third completely depolarized qubit and its elimination after reaching the stationary regime , allows for a more substantial improvement on the entanglement that can be gained asymptotically .",
    "let us consider the difference @xmath249 in the range @xmath250 .",
    "for these values of @xmath230 , no entanglement gain can be achieved by letting the two open qubits evolve towards their stationary state ; that is , @xmath251 however , by adding a completely depolarized qubit and eliminating it after reaching the stationary state , one may get @xmath252 as showed in figure 2 which exhibits the range of parameters @xmath147 ( depending on the environment ) and @xmath230 ( labeling the initial state ) for which this is possible .",
    "vs @xmath247 , @xmath253,width=226 ]    next , consider the difference @xmath254 in the range @xmath219 where two qubits present an entanglement gain , @xmath218 .",
    "such an entanglement gain may be increased by adding a third depolarized qubit as showed in figure 3 .",

    "we have studied the asymptotic states of a lindblad master equation describing the reduced dynamics of three qubits weakly coupled to an environment that affects in the same way any pair of qubits . by applying standard algebraic techniques",
    ", we could control the asymptotic states of a particular family of initial three qubit states of which one is completely depolarized .",
    "we showed that , after eliminating the latter from the asymptotic state , the remaining two qubits may show more entanglement than the asymptotic two - qubit state achievable by direct immersion within such an environment .",
    "this phenomenon can be regarded as an asymptotic manifestation of the richer structure of irreversible entanglement generation in higher dimensional discrete systems that was observed at short times in  @xcite .",
    "given the operators @xmath256 , @xmath172 , the commutant set @xmath89 is found by expanding a generic @xmath30 by means of tensor products of the pauli matrices : @xmath257 and then imposing @xmath258=0 $ ] for all @xmath172 . by using the pauli algebraic relations one finds the following equalities @xmath259 whence @xmath260 for all @xmath261 , @xmath262 for all @xmath263 and @xmath264 , while @xmath265 .",
    "it thus follows that the commutant set is @xmath266 , @xmath267 , namely the linear span of @xmath120 and @xmath268 unlike for two qubits , the commutant set is not commutative ; indeed , with @xmath269 different indices , @xmath270=2i\\varepsilon_{abc}\\,s^{(bc)}\\ , \\quad \\big\\{s^{(ab)}\\,,\\,s^{(ac)}\\big\\}=2\\,s^{(bc)}\\\\ \\label{a4c } & & \\big[s^{(ab)}\\,,\\,s\\big]=4i\\big(s^{(bc)}-s^{(ac)}\\big)\\ , \\quad a < b\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whence @xmath271=[t\\,,\\,s]=0\\ , \\ ] ] so that @xmath272 belongs to the center @xmath273 .",
    "other useful algebraic relations are as follows @xmath274 from the first relations it follows that @xmath275 are two - dimensional , respectively four - dimensional projections . in particular , @xmath183 is the tensor product of the projection onto the singlet state of the qubits @xmath25 and @xmath106 with the identity matrix for the qubit @xmath180 .",
    "furthermore , the projection @xmath276 fulfils @xmath277 other projections commuting with @xmath61 , that is in the commutant @xmath278 are thus all sub - projections @xmath279 for which @xmath280 , whence @xmath281 however , unless @xmath282 , these projections @xmath283 can not belong also to @xmath61 ; this is proved by writing @xmath284 and by imposing the previous conditions .",
    "it thus follows that , for the three - qubit case discussed in this work , neither @xmath285 as this would imply @xmath61 commutative , or @xmath286 as this would imply @xmath287 .",
