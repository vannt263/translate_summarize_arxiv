    "it is still questionable if a fundamental mass  metallicity relation exists since at @xmath10 , the mass  metallicity relation is highly scattered for stellar masses less than 10@xmath11m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this observed scatter may not be surprising given that if a significant metal - poor accretion event occurs , which is especially common at high redshifts , it is expected that the galaxy s integrated metallicity decreases and that it experiences a boost in star formation .",
    "thus , we should expect to see a fundamental mass  metallicity relation at higher redshifts as well .",
    "the time - scale between accretion and induced star formation is still uncertain .",
    "however , direct observations of metallicity and sfr profiles of local metal - poor galaxies have shown that highly star - forming regions within the galaxy have roughly a factor of 10 lower metallicity than the total galaxy metallicity ; indicating that accreted gas is converted into stars within @xmath12  myr @xcite .",
