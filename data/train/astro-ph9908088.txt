    "it was noted first by gould and schrder @xcite in the late sixties `` that observations of cosmic photons in the region @xmath10 to @xmath11 ev would be of great value , since in this region absorption due to the cosmic optical photons is important .",
    "in fact , this may provide a means of determination of the optical photon density and of testing cosmological models . '' although the authors pointed out that quasars may be the potential sources for such observations , and the ground - based cherenkov technique could be the means of study , the real possibility to utilize this idea came one quarter of a century later with the discovery of tev extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources by the whipple collaboration .",
    "these are low - redshift bl lac objects markarian 421 @xmath12 @xcite , markarian 501 @xmath13 @xcite , and 1es2344 + 514 @xmath14 @xcite . the detection of a more distant x - ray bl lac object , pks 2155 - 304 @xmath15 , has been recently reported by the durham group @xcite .",
    "interest in the absorption of extragalactic @xmath0-radiation in recent years has been supported by two reasons : understanding the observational range for extragalactic sources of the very high energy photons ( above @xmath16 tev ) and estimating the density of the ebl photons of rather low energy ( below @xmath16 ev ) .",
    "the first motivation is of great importance for future @xmath0-ray experiments , such as veritas  @xcite , hess  @xcite , and magic  @xcite , and for testing of blazar emission models @xcite .",
    "the second attracts great theoretical attention , since ebl in the energy range @xmath17 ev contains a wealth of information on the early history of the universe providing integral constraints on galaxy and star formation , the initial distribution of stellar masses , metal and dust production , and the rate of re - processing of starlight to infrared wavelengths by the dust @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that a significant fraction of the ebl is contributed by brown dwarfs , accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and the decay of relic particles @xcite .",
    "because the ebl contains a significant fraction of all energy released since the recombination epoch , its determination may set a limit on the energetic balance of the universe and constrain particular energy sources @xcite .",
    "diffuse infrared background experiment ( _ dirbe _ ) and far infrared absolute spectrometer ( _ firas _ ) instrument on board the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) spacecraft @xcite have been used to complete an effort to directly detect an isotropic ebl in ten photometric bands from @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xmath9 m @xcite , and @xmath20 @xmath9 m wavelength interval @xcite .",
    "the detection of the ebl for wavelengths shorter than @xmath21 @xmath9 m have been greatly impaired by the presence of strong backgrounds from interplanetary dust scattering and emission , stars and galactic foregrounds , and from interstellar dust emission . removing these various contaminating radiations to detect a directionally isotropic signal , which is presumably a unique feature of ebl ,",
    "is a difficult task @xcite .",
    "the _ cobe _",
    "collaboration reported a detection of the ebl signal at @xmath21 and @xmath19 @xmath9 m , but established only upper limits in the region @xmath22 @xmath9 m @xcite , the most important interval for attenuation of extragalactic tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "thus , observation of tev and sub - tev extragalactic sources is currently the only relatively direct method which may provide new insight on the distribution of ebl in this wavelength range .",
    "there are two alternatives which can be used to constrain the ebl spectral energy density from @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "first is to model ebl spectra based on the knowledge of galaxy and star evolution , and use it to find the optical depth @xmath23 and survival probability @xmath24 for @xmath0-rays of energy @xmath25 traveling from a source at redshift @xmath26 .",
    "the spectrum of a particular source can be interpreted then as modified by energy - dependent ebl attenuation .",
    "such predictions of the opacity of the universe to @xmath27tev photons have been reported in  @xcite .",
    "many more models have been suggested which derive the ebl sed based on observational constraints and theoretical assumptions ( for a summary and references see  @xcite ) .",
    "these ebl predictions , which can be easily converted into a @xmath0-ray optical depth , are roughly classified in two categories : backward and forward evolution models .",
    "the former models adopt current observations of spectra of galaxies as a function of luminosity and translate them backward in time using data on the redshift evolution of galaxy emissivity .",
    "an example of such empirically based calculations is given by malkan & stecker  @xcite .",
    "the latter models tend to simulate the evolution of galactic systems forward in time assuming initial parameters which do not conflict with current observational data , e.g.  @xcite . a clear advantage of these models is the possibility to test various scenarios , and , if the ebl is observed to have certain features in a spectrum , it may be possible to deduce information about cosmology , galaxy and star formation , as well as absorption and radiation of the light by dust .",
    "both backward and forward evolution models do not guarantee , however , that all potential contributors to the ebl are accounted for and therefore more direct constraints on ebl spectral energy density are desirable .",
    "such an alternative , which attempts to unfold the ebl sed from spectral measurements of extragalactic sources , has been explored recently by stanev & franceschini , and biller et al .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow an analogous strategy to establish limits on ebl from the spectral measurements of two agns , mrk 421 and mrk 501 , and define applicability conditions of such an approach .",
    "the interpretation of the ebl limits derived from tev @xmath0-ray measurements is difficult because the ebl absorption can not be completely isolated from the properties of the source .",
    "although , this problem may be overcome in the future when more tev and sub - tev sources are discovered and the physics of the @xmath0-ray emission from blazars is better understood , at present , this feature of the method remains a major source of uncertainty .",
    "the credibility of these derivations of the ebl limits from tev agn @xmath0-ray measurements is still not accepted  @xcite .",
    "the claim of the first measurement of the ebl by de jager et al .",
    "@xcite derived from an apparent `` cutoff '' in the spectra of mrk 421 at @xmath28 tev  @xcite has not been confirmed .",
    "more recent measurements of the spectra of mrk 421 and mrk 501  @xcite are of much better quality but the interpretation is not unambiguous .",
    "the whipple group  @xcite find curvature in the spectrum of mrk 501 but conclude that the spectrum of mrk 421 is consistent with a simple power law up to 10 tev .",
    "the curvature in the spectrum of mrk 501 is confirmed by the hegra group with high precision  @xcite . because of the apparent differences in the curvature in the spectra of the two agns ( significant only at the @xmath29 sigma level ) , krennrich et al .",
    "@xcite suggest there is no evidence for ebl absorption .",
    "stecker has recently revised an earlier prediction  @xcite and now suggests that the new spectrum of the flaring mrk 501 shows ebl absorption and agrees with one of his ebl models  @xcite .",
    "the recent investigation by stanev & franceschini of the mrk 501 spectrum  @xcite has indicated upper limits on the ebl which almost come into conflict with observational evaluations based on deep surveys of extragalactic sources .",
    "these authors conclude that `` if spectra at tev energies for extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources like this for mrk 501 are confirmed with improved statistics , we may be forced to conclude that the process of @xmath30 interaction in the intergalactic space is more complex than expected and that the average intergalactic magnetic field is extremely weak ( @xmath31 g ) . ''    in this paper",
    "we strive to reconcile these differing interpretations , we attempt to limit the scope of the potential constraints which @xmath0-ray observations may set on the sed of ebl , and we try to confirm some of the earlier results derived from tev @xmath0-ray measurements .",
    "the structure of the paper is as following .",
    "the next section ,  [ eblsummary ] , is a summary of the direct ebl experimental detections , upper and low limits .",
    "these are important for unfolding sed of ebl from the spectra of blazars because they can be used to normalize the ebl contribution to @xmath0-ray absorption and establish upper and low limits on tev @xmath0-ray survival probability . then , in section",
    " [ eblinteraction ] , we consider details of the pair production process , which absorbs high energy photons , and point out several features important for understanding of this fundamental interaction .",
    "we also repeat why one would expect a cutoff in the spectra of tev extragalactic sources caused by the ebl .",
    "the next section ,  [ agnspectra ] , analyzes the recently reported spectra of two agns which provide data over a wide dynamic range , with high statistical quality .",
    "although no apparent cutoffs have been detected up to @xmath2 tev , both spectra are consistent with a non zero curvature . in section ",
    "[ eblunfolding ] we demonstrate that although a cutoff feature is possible , it is not necessarily the only indicator of ebl absorption and the lack of a cutoff in the spectra of agns does not automatically mean low density of ebl . such an alternative is explored in detail in this section , and we derive a sed of ebl which eludes detection due to ambiguity in the interpretation of spectral measurements .",
    "then we determine upper and low limits of this ebl component . in section ",
    "[ eblattenuation ] , we use these data to predict maximal and minimal attenuation in the spectra of a `` mrk 501-like '' blazar at high redshift if such a hypothetical object demonstrates a peak of activity , and compare its flux with the sensitivities of the existing whipple  @xcite and proposed veritas  @xcite @xmath0-ray observatories . the last section ,  [ discussion ] , is devoted to a discussion .",

    "the excess of sed prediction in the uv region can be adjusted to observations in this model either by a higher starlight extinction rate by the dust , or by changing the stellar initial mass distribution to the scalo model  @xcite , which has less mass concentrated in high - mass stars and consequently produces less uv light .",

    "<S> recent observations of the tev @xmath0-ray spectra of the two closest active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , markarian 501 ( mrk 501 ) and markarian 421 ( mrk 421 ) , by the whipple and hegra collaborations have stimulated efforts to estimate or limit the spectral energy density ( sed ) of extragalactic background light ( ebl ) which causes attenuation of tev photons via pair - production when they travel cosmological distances . in spite of the lack of any distinct cutoff - like feature in the spectra of mrk 501 and </S>",
    "<S> mrk 421 ( in the interval @xmath1 tev ) which could clearly indicate the presence of such a photon absorption mechanism , we demonstrate that strong ebl attenuation signal ( survival probability of @xmath2 tev photon @xmath3 ) may still be present in the spectra of these agns . </S>",
    "<S> this attenuation could escape detection due to ambiguity of spectra interpretation between intrinsic properties of the sources and absorption by ebl . by estimating the minimal and maximal opacity of the universe to tev @xmath0-ray photons , we calculate the visibility range for current and future @xmath0-ray observatories , and show that the whipple @xmath0-ray telescope should be able to detect ( in @xmath2 hours at a @xmath4 confidence level ) a bl lac object with properties similar to mrk 501 during its peak activity located at distances up to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed atmospheric cherenkov telescope array veritas should be able to see such an object at least as far as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the proposed experiments , veritas , hess , and magic , may even be able to actually _ measure _ the ebl sed because their observations extend to the critical @xmath7 gev regime . in this transition region </S>",
    "<S> a distinct `` knee - like '' feature should exist in the spectra of blazars , which is invariant with respect to their intrinsic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the spectral index and flux amplitude across this knee , if observed for several blazars , will provide missing pieces of information needed to measure ebl in the wavelength range @xmath8 @xmath9 m .    </S>",
