    "<S> electron spin relaxation in paramagnetic ga(mn)as quantum wells is studied via the fully microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation approach where all the scatterings , such as the electron - impurity , electron - phonon , electron - electron coulomb , electron - hole coulomb , electron - hole exchange ( the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism ) and the @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange scatterings , are explicitly included . </S>",
    "<S> the elliot - yafet mechanism is also incorporated . from this approach , we study the spin relaxation in both @xmath2-type and @xmath3-type ga(mn)as quantum wells . for @xmath2-type ga(mn)as quantum wells where most mn ions take the interstitial positions , we find that the spin relaxation is always dominated by the dp mechanism in the metallic region . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the mn concentration dependence of the spin relaxation time is nonmonotonic and exhibits a peak . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the momentum scattering and the inhomogeneous broadening have different density dependences in the non - degenerate and degenerate regimes . for @xmath3-type ga(mn)as quantum wells , we find that the mn concentration dependence of the spin relaxation time is also nonmonotonic and shows a peak . </S>",
    "<S> differently , the cause of this behaviour is that the @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange scattering ( or the bir - aronov - pikus ) mechanism dominates the spin relaxation in the high mn concentration regime at low ( or high ) temperature , whereas the dp mechanism determines the spin relaxation in the low mn concentration regime . </S>",
    "<S> the elliot - yafet mechanism also contributes to the spin relaxation at intermediate temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the spin relaxation time due to the dp mechanism increases with increasing mn concentration due to motional narrowing , whereas those due to the spin - flip mechanisms decrease with it , which thus leads to the formation of the peak . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature , photo - excitation density and magnetic field dependences of the spin relaxation time in @xmath3-type ga(mn)as quantum wells are investigated systematically with the underlying physics revealed . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with the recent experimental findings . </S>"
