    "parameter estimation in smooth dynamical systems from experimental time series is central to many disciplines across the natural sciences . in many situations ,",
    "the system under study can be modeled by a set of differential equations which governs the evolution of the state variables .",
    "usually , such dynamical models will contain unknown parameters which one expects to estimate from the data .",
    "while much progress has been made in the case of linear dynamics , less is known about the more general case in which the dynamics involves nonlinear terms .",
    "parameter estimation in nonlinear models is strongly case dependent partly because the model solutions can show a qualitative dependence on parameter values @xcite . also",
    ", analytic solutions for a general smooth nonlinear system are typically unknown , posing serious difficulties when trying to associate estimated parameters with probabilities or likelihoods @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the temporal evolution of macroscopic phenomena obeys deterministic rules .",
    "sometimes these rules are derived axiomatically as it is the case for classical and quantum mechanics , while in other areas of knowledge the proposed relationships attempt to capture phenomenological observations . in many situations , macroscopic phenomena",
    "is thought to emerge out of the collective action of many microscopic units , whose dynamical rules can be derived from _ ab - initio _ principles . however",
    ", establishing correspondence between these two scales is one of the oldest and hardest challenges in physics .",
    "this difficulty becomes explicit when studying systems that operate far from equilibrium , as is the case for example , in biological systems .",
    "independently of how these rules are derived , the problem of approximating data with solutions of differential equations seems to be an unavoidable step when comparing theories against real world data .",
    "this is especially difficult if the dynamical equations contain nonlinear terms of their state variables , even if the system is low dimensional .",
    "this problem has been addressed by many authors with particular emphasis in the case that the underlying dynamics is chaotic @xcite .    in many situations",
    "the causal relationships between the state variables of a system can be modeled by a set of differential equations or vector fields .",
    "usually , the equations contain parameters which are assumed either to be stationary or to have a much slower temporal evolution than the state variables . here , we consider such parameterized families of smooth vector fields .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth vector field with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we then have a continuously p - indexed set of solutions @xmath3 for the associated initial value problem    @xmath4    given a time series @xmath5 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^d$ ] we can compare solutions against data using a metric @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a model for @xmath8 , we then investigate the following questions : +    1 .",
    "is the proposed model able to reproduce / explain the data to desired accuracy ? 2 .   which are the parameters that yield the best approximation ?",
    "admittedly , there are more questions to be addressed such as robustness and likelihood of the approximation , but these can be regarded as ulterior inquiries once the answers to the first two points are found .",
    "one could attempt an answer by computing the error between the data and the model solutions as a function of the initial conditions and the parameters .",
    "the cost function can be defined as    @xmath9    the functional form of @xmath10 is in general unknown . assuming that @xmath11 is a discrete sampling of the data with @xmath12 elements , we consider a discretized cost function    @xmath13    here @xmath14 are the values of the solutions in a discrete time domain : this function can be computed numerically to desired accuracy .",
    "minimization of this function yields sets of initial conditions and parameters for which the solutions of the model better resemble the experimental time series , as measured by @xmath15 .",
    "however , it is known that this approach has severe limitations : there are no known global optimization methods for arbitrary nonlinear functions .",
    "good solutions can be obtained efficiently by heuristic solvers such as genetic algorithms , simulated annealing , or the amoeba algorithm @xcite : however , finding the _ best _ solution seems to be an intractable problem for many nonlinear systems .",
    "a major contributing factor to this intractability is that the landscape of @xmath16 can be extremely complicated . for",
    "the sake of illustration , let us assume that @xmath17 is the output of a computer running a simulation of a known low dimensional chaotic system @xmath18 and also that we have access to the program being run .",
    "since the dynamical rules are known along with the initial conditions @xmath19 and the parameters @xmath20 that generate the data , we can check that the global minimum of @xmath21 , thus enabling us to conclude that we have the right model for the data , as expected .",
    "one validation criteria which we could posit would read as follow : there are points @xmath22 for which the model solutions resemble the data optimally , since lower errors can not be attained .",
    "although this criteria seems sufficiently general and does not require knowledge of @xmath18 solutions , in a more realistic setting , the value of the global minimum is unknown and all that can be addressed numerically is local information of the landscape .",
    "this information is completely useless even in this numerical _",
    "gedankenexperiment_.    consider now what happens to the landscape of @xmath16 as more data is introduced .",
    "imagine we are trying to estimate the initial conditions which were used to start the simulation : due to chaos , nearby solutions will diverge exponentially yielding high values in c. eventually as @xmath12 is increased , the values of @xmath16 become settled at some average value resembling the size of the attractor in phase space .",
    "this happens for every point in the domain of @xmath16 that is not the global minimum .",
    "therefore , the landscape near the global minimum becomes extremely sharp as more data is introduced posing a severe limitation to address our agenda .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure 1 for the lorenz system @xcite .",
    "we generated data by numerical integration of the lorenz equations for values of the parameters such that there is a chaotic attractor ( see figure caption ) .",
    "for this we picked initial conditions and parameters @xmath22 and simulated the system for @xmath12 steps .",
    "the resulting solutions are used as data @xmath17 for the cost function of the system ( [ eq : disccostfunction ] ) : we compute mismatch of model output and data with the least squares metric @xmath23 , and assume that each @xmath24 corresponds to a time step in an runge - kutta o(4 ) integration routine with @xmath25 .",
    "figure 1 shows how the landscape of @xmath16 changes as @xmath12 is increased .",
    "when the number of data points is low , the global minimum is easily identified . as more data is introduced ,",
    "the landscape near the global minimum becomes extremely sharp until it can no longer be resolved in the plots .",
    "the choice to evaluate @xmath16 as a function of initial conditions was made for simplicity but the same properties should hold for parameter space . because the attractor persists for small variations of the parameters , a similar argument can be made with the same outcome . for values of the parameters close to @xmath20 ,",
    "the shape of the attractor changes but the mixing properties of the vector field remain invariant : if initial conditions are kept fixed and a neighborhood of @xmath20 is explored , solutions will land on attractors that are slightly different and this will have the same effect as if the same attractor is being approached from slightly different initial conditions .",
    "overall , this example suggests that if we are to test the hypothesis that data corresponds to a chaotic system , a departure from the cost function is in order .",
    "[ fig : lorenz ]     the keen observer has probably realized that if the number of data points @xmath12 is low , the minima looks round and is easy to find , suggesting that tracking the parameters over short segments of time could prove useful .",
    "this is the idea behind coupling the model to the data and it has been explored by many authors : in particular , it has been show that under certain conditions , when the model is coupled to the data the cost function is smoothed or ` regularized ' , and parameters can be estimated @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the regularized cost function can be extremely flat and therefore , finding its minima becomes hard to do numerically .",
    "recently , abarbanel et al .",
    "proposed a method to estimate parameters in chaotic models called dpe @xcite which addresses this issue .",
    "they regularize the cost function by coupling the model with the data while penalizing coupling by adding a term proportional to the coupling strength in a new balanced cost function : this leads to a function that can be minimized and yields the right answer .",
    "we follow a closely related approach , but aim for a different question : can data be approximated by smooth unfoldings of low dimensional systems ?",
    "synchronization - based parameter estimation techniques rely on coupling the data to the model equations and are at the heart of many estimation procedures @xcite . in this work",
    "we introduce a synchronization - based transformation for time series which aims at exploring the possibility that data can be approximated by a driven nonlinear system . for this",
    "we explore a family of synchronization schemes by allowing model parameters to change in time so that the resulting solutions would better resemble a given dataset . in this way a map is induced between transient solutions of the model and the parametric fluctuations which are required to generate them .",
    "we assume that in general , better approximations come at the cost of introducing more complex fluctuations",
    ". however , it could be the case that there are parameters for which the fluctuations take a particularly simple form at the same time that they yield solutions which are good approximations to the dataset .",
    "in what follows , the transformation is motivated by considering an idealized continuous case while rigorous definitions are postponed to the next section . in order to allow for better approximations",
    "we consider an extension of the cost function which includes arbitrary parametric fluctuations in @xmath26 .",

    "the goal here is to define a map between a particular transient solution of the model and the parametric fluctuations which generate it .",
    "since parameter fluctuations greatly augment the degrees of freedom of @xmath26 it is expected in general that @xmath38 . for a sufficiently complex fluctuation @xmath37",
    "we will be able to approximate @xmath8 very well regardless of the structure imposed by our assumptions .",
    "we note however , that for different values of the parameters of @xmath39 , there might be other simpler fluctuations which might approximate @xmath8 similarly well .",
    "our objective is to select the parameters for which the optimally matching fluctuations take the simplest form while the approximation also meets a goodness criteria .",

    "our hypothesis is that for most parameter values there is a tradeoff between @xmath42 and @xmath40 $ ] in such a way that obtaining good solutions comes at the cost of increasing the complexity of the corresponding fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we seek values of the parameters for which our hypothesis does not hold : namely , better approximations are obtained by simpler parametric fluctuations .",
    "if the fluctuations that are required to approximate a given dataset are as complex as the dataset itself , we would argue that the model is acting as a complicated mapping .",
    "however , if the approximations are generated by simple time dependent parametric fluctuations , any additional complexity that the data might have which is captured by the model solutions , would be due to _ specific _ nonlinearities in @xmath26 .",
    "if it is true that there is a negative correlation between the error of the approximations and the complexity of the corresponding fluctuations , departures from this general tendency could be quantified and exploited to detect parameter values of interest .    in the next section",
    "we propose a discrete nonlinear transformation for time series inspired by the continuous case . later in this article this definition",

    "this is supported by numerical results in the next section but it is not expected to be the general case . however , we do expect that if we have the right model , it will synchronize with the data and good approximations will be obtained . in general we expect that by allowing parametric fluctuations , better approximations can be achieved , even if the model is wrong . in that case",

    "however , if we also assume that the system is being driven by an external signal a wild diversity of behaviors are unleashed .    in order to test the transformation introduced in the last section ,",

    "the global attractor of the _ autonomous _ system ( @xmath89 ) is an attractive limit cycle : a stable nonlinear oscillatory solution .",
    "it is know that these solutions can synchronize with an external periodic forcing @xcite . due to the nonlinear nature of these solutions ,",
    "this entrainment occurs in very different ways : for some regions of @xmath90 space the period of the solution matches the forcing period ( 1:1 ) , but there are regions for which this ratio can take in principle any ( p : q ) value .",
    "these regions are generically known as arnold tongues due to their v - shape in @xmath91 space and we refer to them collectively as the arnold tongues diagram of the system @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the solutions greatly differs from one tongue to another so this offers an appealing strategy for coding different morphologies into simple control signals .",

    "( [ eq : omegadefinition ] ) when considering the unperturbed system ( [ eq : wc ] ) .",
    "since both alternatives yield the same error value , we can choose to consider data as being approximated by system ( [ eq : wc ] ) when forced by @xmath100 or as being approximated by system ( [ eq : wcgenforcing ] ) when forced by @xmath101 .",
    "this choice will become important when quantifying the complexity of the resulting transformation due to the choice of @xmath44 and also when considering experimental data .",

    "if there is a negative correlation between error and entropy , a set of solutions that are simple and approximate data well would look like horns departing from the cloud that can be ` shaved ' by choosing different values of @xmath145 in @xmath148 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the reason that both the model parameters and the forcing signal can be ` guessed ' at the same time is because of the fact that the fluctuations used to generate data were simple .",
    "consider the case in which data is generated with complex fluctuations ( for example , fig .",
    "3 with @xmath149 ) . it would not be true anymore that transformations corresponding to nearby values of @xmath80 will be more complex than the fluctuations used to generate the data . while the error of the approximations will still be low for many choices of @xmath80 , the entropy curve will still exhibit a dent around @xmath135 and it would be wrongly concluded that data was generated with a harmonic forcing with @xmath135 .",
    "another situation in which our approach fails is that in which data is generated by a system driven by noise , since in this case the real fluctuations would not be simple .",
    "it could also happen that there are no dents in the entropy curve . in this case",
    "it could be argued that since there are no parameters for which the fluctuations take a simple form , the structure of the model is spurious and that it should be discarded . in the next section",
    "we apply this ideas to a well studied example in motor control from the field of birdsong .",
    "during song production , canaries rely on a repertoire of motor gestures which are ultimately responsible of driving their vocal organ . these gestures",
    "roughly correspond to the muscular activity by which the tension of the vocal folds is controlled and the respiratory activity which governs the air flow through the syrinx @xcite . here , experimental data consists of recordings of the air sac pressure of a canary while singing and it is shown in figure 5(b ) top row ( green curves ) .",
    "we show that there are parameters for system([eq : wc ] ) such that the data can be approximated by model solutions if a simple forcing is also assumed .",
    "in this example we chose a segment that contains a transition between two apparently different gestures : data consists of two approximately periodic signals with similar frequencies and marked morphological differences .",
    "note that if no external forcing is assumed there is little hope that the 2 dimensional system ( [ eq : wc ] ) will approximate the data .",
    "one can speculate that data can be approximated by the forced system ( [ eq : forcedwc ] ) if the amplitude and frequency of the forcing is allowed to change when the gesture changes .",
    "we can include the possibility that the system is being generically forced by assuming system ( [ eq : wcgenforcing ] ) .",
    "this assumption greatly increases the goodness of the resulting approximations yielding remarkably good fits .",
    "the objective is to check if there are parameters for which the model approximates data with simple fluctuations .",
    "a solution is considered ` good ' if it satisfies that the error is less than a threshold @xmath150 .",
    "once this condition is achieved , we seek to minimize the complexity of the required fluctuations , thus ` increasing ' the parsimony of our assumptions .",
    "this is done by optimizing function ( [ eq : h2 ] ) on a search space over parameter and initial conditions space .",
    "the reason we choose to minimize eqn .",
    "( [ eq : h2 ] ) instead of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : h1 ] ) is that evaluation of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : h1 ] ) requires knowledge of the error - entropy distribution .",
    "once a solution is found it can be checked if it is also a local minima of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : h1 ] ) .",
    "the optimization is performed by a genetic algorithm over a search space as follows : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 . in order to train the algorithm",
    ", we used a ` low resolution ' transformation by setting @xmath156 .",
    "this allowed us to test for many solutions in a computationally efficient way .",
    "at this point we should point out that the landscape of @xmath146 will change dramatically on the choice of the parameters for @xmath48 .",
    "however , the suspicion remains that broad features of the landscape of @xmath146 are invariant to this parameter after some value , and it turned out to be a successful strategy for training the algorithm .",
    "the final scheme we adopted to define @xmath146 was @xmath157 .",
    "the maximum amplitude for the fluctuations was also adjusted to @xmath158 .",
    "optimization was performed on a commercially available desk computer : the algorithm was run for 1000 generations starting from 100 random seeds and yielded parameters @xmath159 and initial conditions @xmath160 .",
    "[ fig : experesults ]     as before , we want to show that the parameters so obtained can be found as the minima of a function that implements a parsimony rule .",
    "for this we explore a neighborhood of the solution we found by optimizing @xmath146 taking @xmath109 equally spaced samples in the domain @xmath161 . although the parameters were found by setting @xmath162 for computational reasons , in order to construct @xmath131 a higher resolution @xmath102 was used , so that both examples share the same synchronization scheme .",
    "results of this section are summarized in figure 5 .",
    "the error of the approximation and the entropy of the fluctuations were calculated at each point in the sample domain .",
    "the error - entropy distribution is shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) along with the estimated linear correlation .",
    "the corresponding plots of error , entropy and distance to the fit are shown in figure 5(b ) .",
    "local minima of @xmath131 were highlighted with filled circles and filled stars .",
    "figure 5(c , d ) shows the model approximation and the fluctuations at each of these locations along with the comparison with data .",
    "green curves correspond to data , blue curves correspond to model output and the red curves are the parametric fluctuations . in order to interpret the results ,",
    "a fourier analysis was performed on each time series in ( c ) : this analysis was done independently for each half ( dashed line ) of the temporal domain so that changes in the signals can be better visualized .",
    "note that in both solutions , the forcing signal fundamental frequency is located to the right of the fundamental frequency of the model output .",
    "this suggests that the model might be responding subharmonically to the forcing signal .",
    "while both of the starred solutions seem to be interesting , solutions corresponding to the circled local minima fail for different reasons .",
    "these are plotted in figure 5(d ) for illustration : the red and yellow ones fail because the approximation is worse than in other points , even though that the fluctuations are simple .",
    "the purple one fails because of the excessive complexity of the required fluctuations . despite",
    "that this solution is simpler than its neighbors and also approximates the data , it is more complex than the starred solution which does an equally good job at approximating the data",
    ".    it should be clear that the autonomous system ( [ eq : wc ] ) will not be able to reproduce data very efficiently : simple inspection of the data indicates that the pressure patterns come in at least two flavors , with and without the wiggle .",
    "since the most similar solution that can be expected from ( [ eq : wc ] ) is a limit cycle , we would only be able to adjust the frequency of the cycle in order to minimize the error and both gestures would be approximated by the same morphology .",
    "if we insist on explaining the wiggles , better approximations are needed and therefore model ( [ eq : wc ] ) should be discarded .",
    "one however , could have other reasons to believe that the model is correct and impose the model on the data : this was done in the last section by greatly increasing the model degrees of freedom while still retaining the basic underlying structure .    in this example",
    ", the air sac pressure of a singing bird is approximated by a simple nonlinear system which is being driven by an external signal .",
    "we defined an objective function which relies on a mapping between approximations and fluctuations .",
    "this allowed us to find model parameters such that the required fluctuations exhibited minimal complexity as measured by @xmath44 .",
    "once this solution was identified , we constructed a parsimony criteria by approximating the scaling relationship between error and entropy .",
    "this provided a way to leverage these two quantities and seek for an optimal solution .",
    "this balance is measured by function ( [ eq : h1 ] ) and careful inspection shows that there is not a single ` sweet ' spot , but many local minima .",
    "this means that there are several ways the data can be approximated by simple fluctuations .",
    "two mechanisms were found which are interesting and seem to differ from each other . in the first case ,",
    "the data is approximated at first , as a period ( 1:1 ) response to a low frequency forcing .",
    "then , as the wiggle becomes apparent , the model solution resembles a period ( 1:2 ) solution .",
    "the observation that canary respiratory gestures can be approximated as subharmonic solutions of a driven nonlinear substrate was proposed in @xcite and later quantified in closely related models @xcite . there , harmonic input signals were explicitly assumed and parameters were allowed to change in a step - wise manner : it was shown that this and similar models posses subharmonic solutions which yield quantitatively good fits to the data , but the criteria for the choice of the parameters was qualitative . here",
    ", we have made a more generic assumption : that the model is being forced by a specific parameter dependent family of fluctuations .",
    "strikingly , the subharmonic transition was identified as being one of the simplest mechanisms for approximating the data , which is the reason why it corresponds to a local minima of @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , by comparing the balance of error and entropy for neighboring solutions , the choice of the model parameters is justified quantitatively .",
    "the second mechanism is qualitatively different . at first",
    ", the model response is periodic with a period which is similar to period of the forcing . during this epoch , the forcing is also approximately periodic but it is not harmonic .",
    "when the pressure pattern changes the model solution is also very similar to a subharmonic solution but the way the bifurcation occurs is very different .",
    "a possible interpretation of this mechanism could read as follows : the forcing signal can be thought to be due to an incoming signal of frequency @xmath163 plus a copy of the same signal lagged by a phase @xmath164 .",
    "this suggests that the transition between regimes could be controlled by small changes in the lag .",
    "this analysis allows us to conclude the following : there are parameters of system ( [ eq : wc ] ) for which the solutions of the model explain detailed features of the data at the cost of assuming specific realizations of the forcing signal . given a search space , we found parameters for which the forcing signal takes the simplest possible form as measured by @xmath165 , within a family of signals which facilitate synchronization with data . by seeking a balance between error and parsimony ,",
    "two alternative mechanisms were identified . in both cases ,",
    "the second regime is approximated by a subharmonic solution , but they differ in the way the transition occurs . the possibility that the control signal is changing its frequency was explored quantitatively while careful exploration of the second mechanism remains to be done .",
    "both possibilities are appealing because , within this frameset , they are maximally parsimonious and also they offer a testable prediction : modification of the delicate timing between the substrate response and the forcing signal should lead to very different output patterns @xcite .",
    "estimation of model parameters from experimental time series is a central problem in many disciplines . our limited ability to perform this task in the case",
    "the model is nonlinear can be traced back to the fact that there are no known general procedures for global nonlinear optimization .",
    "furthermore , in an experimental setting we are likely to be uncertain about the functional form of the underlying dynamical rules . moreover , in the case of physiological data , it is likely that the system under observation is taking input from external sources so it can not be considered in isolation .",
    "therefore , investigating parametric fluctuations can be relevant in some situations of interest .    in this work we proposed a nonlinear transformation for time series and",
    "motivated its usefulness .",
    "we draw inspiration from an ideally continuous case to define the transformation @xmath48 of a given dataset .",
    "this transformation takes the observed time series and returns the parametric fluctuations that yield solutions which optimally match the time series .",
    "it is clear that in many situations better approximations can be achieved by allowing arbitrary fluctuations in the parameters : this follows from the fact that considering arbitrary fluctuations yields a system with infinite degrees of freedom which can accommodate any dataset .",
    "however , due to nonlinearity , this transformation is highly dependent on the functional form and parameter values of model @xmath39 .",
    "here we showed in a case study , that for specific nonlinearities coded in @xmath39 the fluctuations take a simple form .",
    "this transformation was applied to the problem of parameter estimation in a case study with both numerical and experimental data .",
    "we tailored our procedure to address the question of whether a system is making use of nonlinear mechanisms to code for different functionalities .",
    "the idea that controlling the unstable periodic orbits in chaotic attractor could serve as a strategy to generate qualitatively different behavior was proposed by ott et .",
    "al.@xcite and demonstrated experimentally in a chemical system @xcite .",
    "recent work in the field of birdsong suggests that much of the complexity observed in the song and respiratory patterns of canaries can be successfully explained by considering simple time dependent unfoldings of low dimensional nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "this ideas were tested in a simple rate coding model for populations of neurons .",
    "data was generated by driving the model with simple harmonic signals .",
    "small changes in the forcing signal lead to qualitatively different behavior : this is the scenario in which these methods seem to be useful .",
    "then , we proceeded to ask if the general structure of the unperturbed model ( [ eq : wc ] ) held any relationship with the numeric data . by construction",
    ", solutions of the autonomous model fail to approximate the datasets .",
    "however , considering the alternative hypothesis that fluctuations were present at the time of the measurements , we found that there is a range in parameter space for which the cost of introducing this hypothesis is minimal .",
    "these ranges correspond roughly to the values of the parameters used to generate the dataset .",
    "therefore we conclude that local minima of @xmath166 potentially provide insight about the underlying dynamics which generated the data .",
    "we have also studied a closely related function which does not require evaluation in a sample domain and yields the same answer for a range in the threshold values .",
    "this function was used as an objective function for model identification when we considered experimental data .",
    "model ( [ eq : wcgenforcing ] ) was trained to satisfy a threshold condition for the quality of the approximations by using simple fluctuations .",
    "we found ranges in parameter space for which the scaling relationship between error and entropy breaks maximally .",
    "inspection of these minima revealed two qualitatively different solutions .",
    "interestingly , in both cases data is approximated by a solution which resembles very much a bifurcating period 2 solution : the difference lies in the way this bifurcation is controlled .",
    "the fact that data could be approximated by a forced low dimensional system is very interesting from the theoretical point of view . on the one hand ,",
    "if the systems are low dimensional , there are methods to classify families of models according to the geometrical mechanisms which underlie the generation of complex behavior @xcite .",
    "in particular , period doubling solutions have been found experimentally in many physical systems and they can be associated to universal scaling laws @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown that even in the case of having many nonlinear interacting units , the resulting macroscopic average behavior can follow low dimensional dynamical rules . a recent breakthrough in the analysis of kuramoto s model due to ott and antonsen allows to obtain mean field equations for classes of closely related models @xcite . in some situations , the mean field equations exhibit non trivial bifurcation diagrams which share many features with system ( [ eq : wc ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that there are conditions under which the average behavior of a driven set of excitable units displays complex behavior by dynamical variations of the degree of synchrony in the driven population @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that by using a mean field description , algorithms can be designed that are successful at controlling these attractors @xcite .",
    "thus , there is hope that much of the complexity in macroscopic phenomena can be captured by low dimensional nonlinear mechanisms .",
    "the purpose of this work is to further bridge the gap between the description and characterization of qualitative nonlinear mechanisms and quantification .",
    "finally , we note that the same mapping can be used to explore how a given nonlinear system may optimize other quantities of interest by considering alternative metrics on the parametric fluctuations .",
