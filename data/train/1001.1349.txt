    "the phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) method has emerged as an attractive computational approach to simulate the evolution of crystalline patterns @xcite . by resolving the crystal density field",
    ", it naturally incorporates defects and elastic interactions arising from localized and large scale distortions of this field , respectively .",
    "moreover , this method can in principle be used to simulate microstructural evolution on diffusive time scales that are much longer than typical time scales accessible by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .    like classical density function theory ( dft ) ,",
    "the pfc method is based on representing the free - energy of a material by a functional of its density @xcite .",
    "however , classical dft and the pfc method use different functionals to achieve different goals .",
    "classical dft seeks a physically realistic mean - field description of the crystal density field @xmath3 to reproduce quantitatively as accurately as possible the properties of a material .",
    "since @xmath3 is sharply peaked around mean atomic positions , this generally requires a very large number of terms in the traditional expansion of the number density as a sum of density waves @xmath4 where each @xmath5 represents a different reciprocal lattice vector ( rlv ) in this unrestricted sum .",
    "in contrast , by using a considerably simplified density functional , the pfc method essentially restricts this sum to a much smaller set of reciprocal lattice vectors in order to simulate efficiently the evolution of the crystal field on length and time scales as large as possible .",
    "recent studies have shown that , despite this loss of realism , pfc models are able to reproduce quantitatively certain key properties that influence microstructural evolution such as the crystal - melt interfacial free - energy @xcite , the bulk modulus @xcite , and grain - boundary energies @xcite , which have been computed for the test case of pure fe .    despite this progress , the pfc method has only been developed for a small set of crystal structures .",
    "the original formulation of elder _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite uses the same free - energy functional as the swift - hohenberg model of pattern formation @xcite of the form @xmath6 with the free - energy density @xmath7 \\phi + g\\frac{\\phi^4}{4},\\label{onemode}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 represents the crystal density field .",
    "this one - mode model essentially truncates the sum ( [ sumk ] ) to one set of rlvs with equal magnitude @xmath9 since higher @xmath10 modes have much smaller amplitude . as a result",
    ", it favors crystal structures for which the principal rlvs can form `` triads '' ( i.e. closed triangles ) , which include hexagonal and body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) ordering in two and three dimensions , respectively . aside from favoring those structures , triad interactions are essential for solid - liquid coexistence .",
    "this is because in a weakly nonlinear expansion of the bulk free - energy density of the form , @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 for all principal rlvs ) , triads contribute a cubic term with a negative coefficient @xmath13 . since @xmath14 and @xmath15 are both positive , this cubic term is responsible for the existence of a free - energy barrier between the two minima of @xmath16 corresponding to liquid ( @xmath17 ) and solid ( @xmath18 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use a `` two - mode '' phase - field - crystal model to model face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) structures , which has the free - energy density @xmath19   + g\\frac{\\phi^4}{4}.\\ ] ] this model truncates the sum ( [ sumk ] ) to two sets of rlvs with magnitude @xmath9 and @xmath20 , respectively , where the first set corresponds in general to the principal rlvs and the second to some other set with larger wavevector magnitude ; all other rlvs have much smaller amplitude .",
    "this construct provides more flexibility to form triad interactions by combining rlvs from those two sets , and hence to describe other crystal structures .",
    "we demonstrate this here for fcc ordering , which is obtained by choosing the sets @xmath21 and @xmath22 to correspond to @xmath0 ( principal set ) and @xmath1 rlvs , respectively , with @xmath23 .",
    "while there is in principle freedom in the choice of the second set @xmath22 for a given structure , we have chosen this set such that @xmath24 is as small as possible , as desired for computational efficiency .",
    "the form ( [ twomode ] ) reduces in the limit @xmath25 to the free - energy density introduced by lifshitz and petrich @xcite as a generalization of the swift - hohenberg model to describe two - dimensional quasiperiodic patterns observed in faraday wave experiments , which result from the superposition of two frequencies .",
    "although formulated primarily to describe those patterns , this model was also shown to describe other patterns , including regular square crystal lattices in two dimensions with the choice @xmath26 , which couples @xmath27 and @xmath28 rlvs .",
    "the present introduction of the parameter @xmath29 in the form ( [ twomode ] ) provides the additional flexibility to change the relative stability of different crystal structures .",
    "this is because in the limit @xmath30 , this form reduces formally to the original swift - hohenberg form ( [ onemode ] ) after a simple rescaling of the parameters .",
    "hence , as @xmath29 is increased the contribution of the second @xmath31-mode becomes less significant in comparison to the first @xmath32-mode .",
    "consequently , as @xmath29 is increased from zero , the crystal structure favored by the two - mode interaction becomes metastable with respect to the one - mode structure . this added capability to model the coexistence of two different crystal structures , in addition to the coexistence of each structure with a liquid , should prove useful to model a wide range of phase transformations with a pfc approach .    in the next section ,",
    "we scale the parameters of the model to write the free - energy functional in a dimensionless form with only three parameters : @xmath33 , which is the standard pfc model parameter analogous to temperature that controls the size of the solid - liquid coexistence regions as a function of density , @xmath34 , whose value is generally determined by the choice of crystal structure , and @xmath35 controls the relative stability of the two - mode and one - mode structures ( fcc and bcc , respectively ) . in this section",
    ", we also use a standard common tangent construction to compute the phase - diagram in the plane of density and @xmath33 for an illustrative choice of @xmath36 .",
    "the phase diagram exhibits regions of bcc - liquid and fcc - liquid coexistence for small and large epsilon , respectively .",
    "the size of the fcc - liquid coexistence region depends generally on @xmath37 . for @xmath25 where eq .",
    "( [ twomode ] ) reduces to the free - energy density of lifshitz and petrich @xcite , the analog phase - diagram only exhibits fcc - liquid coexistence , so that a finite @xmath29 is necessary for the phase diagram to exhibit both bcc - liquid and fcc - liquid coexistence .",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach with some simulations of polycrystalline growth and ( 111 ) twin growth . a numerical computation of the ( 111 ) twin boundary energy for parameters of ni is given in an appendix .",
    "the ability to model twin growth is important for solidification modeling since twins can dramatically alter both eutectic @xcite and dendritic @xcite microstructures .    in section iii ,",
    "we carry out an amplitude expansion of the bulk free - energy density in the small @xmath33 limit .",
    "this expansion exploits the property that , with the scaling @xmath38 , the amplitudes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 density waves scale as , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , while the density difference between solid and liquid scales @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , this density difference can be neglected in the small @xmath33 limit and the bulk free - energy density can be expressed solely in terms of those amplitudes .",
    "as required for solid - liquid coexistence , the free - energy density has minima in the ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) plane corresponding to liquid ( @xmath44 ) and fcc solid ( finite @xmath42 and @xmath43 values that depend on @xmath45 ) . by comparing this form to the free - energy density for a single amplitude of bcc density waves ( corresponding to @xmath46 rlvs ) ,",
    "we identify different regions of relative fcc and bcc stability , which explains the phase diagram computed in section ii .    in section iv , we discuss how to determine the two - mode pfc model parameters to relate them quantitatively to different materials .",
    "we follow essentially the same approach developed by two of the authors for the standard pfc one - mode model for bcc ordering @xcite . for bcc ,",
    "the parameters were completely determined by fitting three parameters : ( i ) the peak value of the liquid structure factor , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , ( ii ) the second derivative of the fourier transform of the direct correlation function at this peak , @xmath49 , and ( iii ) the solid density wave amplitude @xmath50 . for fcc ,",
    "all the parameters except @xmath37 are determined by the same fit , where @xmath51 .",
    "( the shape of the structure factor at @xmath52 is not realistically modeled given the limited number of model parameters . )",
    "@xmath37 then determines the ratio @xmath53 of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 solid amplitudes , which can be varied to alter the relative stability of fcc and bcc .    in section v",
    ", we derive analytical expressions for the three independent elastic constants of a cubic material , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , for both the standard one - mode pfc model ( [ onemode ] ) and the present two - mode model ( [ twomode ] ) .",
    "we use a brute force approach that consists of calculating to quadratic order the change of solid free - energy density , modeled by a one- or two - mode approximation for bcc and fcc , respectively , due to small dilation or shear transformations of the unit cell .",
    "we have checked that we obtain identical expressions to those derived recently by spatschek and karma for general lattices using an amplitude equation framework @xcite , which provides a non - trivial self - consistent test of our calculations .",
    "for the one - mode bcc model ( [ onemode ] ) , the elastic constants are @xmath57 where @xmath48 .",
    "for the two - mode fcc model ( [ twomode ] ) , @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath51 and @xmath60 for simplicity .    using values of @xmath49 and density wave amplitudes from molecular dynamics simulations for parameters of bcc fe and fcc ni , we find that the above expressions give reasonable estimates of elastic constants ( e.g. , @xmath61 gpa for one - mode bcc pfc model compared to @xmath62 gpa in md fe and @xmath63 gpa for the two - mode fcc pfc model compared to @xmath64 gpa in md ni ) .",
    "the predicted values generally tend to be lower than the constants computed from md simulations , but such discrepancies are to be expected given the pfc models are based on one or two modes .",
    "the analytical predictions for the elastic constants allow us to draw two important general conclusions pertaining to the development of pfc models for different crystal structures and to the method used to determine the parameters of those models .    the first conclusion , which follows directly from eqs .",
    "( [ c11twomode ] ) and ( [ c12twomode ] ) , is that the presence of the second mode , which corresponds to [ 200 ] density waves , is essential to obtain a physically meaningful set of elastic constants for fcc . without this second mode ( @xmath65 ) ,",
    "( [ c11twomode ] ) and ( [ c12twomode ] ) , predict that @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that the tetragonal shear modulus @xmath67 vanishes , and that the system is mechanically marginally stable .",
    "of course , these analytical expressions for the elastic constants neglects the contributions of higher modes that are present in a full solution of the pfc equations .",
    "however , those higher modes are generally small for the small values of @xmath33 corresponding to fe and ni parameters .",
    "therefore , the contributions of those modes will generally be small and will not change qualitatively this picture .    while it is in principle possible to select energetically different crystal structures in the pfc model with the addition of other nonlinearities in the free - energy density ( such as @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) @xcite , this approach will be of limited applicability for crystal structures like fcc where one mode does not suffice to produce the correct elastic properties .",
    "this is also true for simple cubic lattices and two - dimensional square lattices .",
    "the latter are briefly examined in section vi by coupling @xmath27 and @xmath28 density waves .",
    "the second conclusion , which is general , is that the elastic constants are uniquely determined once the phase - field model parameters have been fitted to the peak liquid structure properties , which fixes @xmath49 , and the solid density wave amplitudes , as in the approach of wu and karma @xcite summarized above .",
    "this also fixes the value of the elastic bulk modulus @xmath70 in general , the bulk modulus can also be defined from the thermodynamic relation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the total free - energy , @xmath73 is the volume , and @xmath74 is the number density .",
    "the second equality in the last equation can in principle be used to compute the bulk modulus directly from the pfc solid free - energy curve ( @xmath75 versus @xmath76 ) , without computing the elastic constants . for a perfect crystal without vacancy ,",
    "( [ kdef1 ] ) and ( [ kdef2 ] ) should in principle predict the same bulk modulus .",
    "however , the two definitions can give different predictions for the pfc model because the number of atoms per peak of the crystal density field is not constrained to unity . while the average number of atoms per peak will also differ from unity in a real crystal with vacancies , thereby altering the open - system elastic constants @xcite , the vacancy concentration is generally very small even at melting .",
    "how to meaningfully relate the predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ kdef1 ] ) and ( [ kdef2 ] ) for the bulk modulus is unclear in the pfc approach that , by construct , does not use a realistic description of the crystal density field , and also does not model vacancy formation explicitly .    despite these limitations of the pfc approach , jaatinen _ et al .",

    "( [ kdef2 ] ) predicts the correct bulk modulus using the solid free - energy curve may appear desirable .",

    "( [ c11onemode])-([c12twomode ] ) predict reasonable values of the elastic constants .",
    "in fact , any one- or two - mode model with the same peak liquid structure factor properties and density wave amplitudes will predict essentially the same elastic constants associated with the free - energy cost of lattice distortions , and also the same interfacial energies as can be inferred from amplitude equations @xcite .",
    "since those elastic constants and interfacial energies are the quantities that matter most for modeling microstructural evolution in a pfc context , we have not found it necessary to formulate the two - mode pfc model in such a way that the bulk modulus is also correctly predicted from the solid free - energy curve using eq .",
