    "the last decade of study has brought into sharper focus the bimodality of the star formation histories of galaxies . for star - forming galaxies alone , there is a relatively tight distribution of star formation rates ( sfrs ) at a given mass ( @xmath5dex scatter , with a fraction of outliers to high sfr ; e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , persisting out to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the red sequence has sfrs substantially below those expected for star forming galaxies ( but often with some star formation ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will call these ` quiescent galaxies ' in what follows .",
    "the relative prominence of the two populations is a function of stellar mass , surface density , inferred velocity dispersion @xmath7 , and galaxy structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this correlation between the structural properties of galaxies with their stellar populations is important : it signals that the processes that determine the structures of galaxies at least correlate , and perhaps are the same as , the processes that shape whether or not a galaxy has cold gas and star formation .",
    "furthermore , these two populations evolve in their relative importance : while the star - forming population has a stellar mass function that evolves slowly @xcite , the quiescent galaxy stellar mass function evolves rapidly from @xmath8 to the present day ( largely in normalization by factors of @xmath9 , but with modest or no evolution in shape or ",

    "a great deal of work , both theoretical and observational , has been carried out to try to better understand the drivers of the evolution of these two populations , particularly why some galaxies appear capable of shutting off their star formation while others are incapable of doing so . in this study , we will focus on processes that can shut down star formation in galaxies which reside in the center of their own dark matter halo .",
    "the clear effects of gas removal / starvation in dense environments ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for recent discussions of this issue using survey datasets ) are only a minor contributor to the evolution of ` cosmic averaged ' galaxy population , owing to the small number of galaxies inhabiting dense environments @xcite . accordingly , we do not discuss the effect of environment in this paper ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a careful discussion of the effects of environment as a function of cosmic time ) .",
    "an important point is that models that include the growth of the dark matter framework , gas cooling , star formation and stellar feedback alone fail to predict a widespread population of non - star - forming galaxies @xcite ; all galaxies are expected to accrete cold gas and form stars .    a number of possible mechanisms have been proposed to keep a galaxy in the center of its own halo free of a significant cold gas content . noting the strong tendency of quiescent galaxies to have prominent ( or dominant ) bulge components",
    ", it has long been thought that merging plays an important role in determining their structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a variety of evidence that is qualitatively ( and in certain cases quantitatively ) consistent with this picture : the approximate equality of the merger rate and the quiescent galaxy formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the detailed kinematic structure of early - type galaxies @xcite ; and , the empirical association between relatively younger stellar populations and substructure ( tidal tails , shells , asymmetries , etc . ) in quiescent galaxies @xcite .    largely in the merger context , the possibility that feedback from accretion onto a supermassive black hole may drive gas out of galaxies @xcite or keep gas around galaxies from cooling @xcite has been explored .",
    "a wide array of observations are , at least at face value , qualitatively consistent with such a picture : e.g. , galaxies with big bulges have big black holes @xcite , low - redshift galaxies without prominent bulges can not shut off their star formation on their own @xcite , rapid large - scale winds are observed around post - starburst galaxies and quasars @xcite , and the energy measured in agn - inflated outflow cavities in the hot gas atmosphere of groups and clusters of galaxies is approximately consistent with the energy required to offset cooling @xcite .",
    "there are a number of other possible mechanisms for shutting off star formation , however , that are not related to feedback .",
    "a few examples are : the heating of the gaseous halo through virialization of the gas content @xcite , changes in the mode of gas accretion onto galaxies as a function of dark matter halo mass @xcite , and the possibility of the growth of a stellar spheroid stabilizing a gas disk @xcite .      given the range of possible mechanisms for shutting off star formation on galactic scales for galaxies in the center of their own halos ( ` centrals ' hereafter ) , gathering empirical insight into the properties of non star - forming galaxies as a function of cosmic epoch can be helpful . it has been argued that the key parameter that correlates with the paucity of star formation is stellar surface density @xcite , or possibly velocity dispersion ( @xcite ; or roughly equivalently as @xmath11 ; @xcite ) . yet , for a sample of low - redshift galaxies from the sdss , @xcite instead argues that srsic index correlates much better with a lack of star formation for galaxies in the center of their own halo ( that could not have been stripped of their gas by external influences ) , as non - star forming galaxies have uniformly high srsic indices but a range of surface densities that overlap with star - forming galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such an investigation of srsic indices has not been carried out at @xmath12 owing to a lack of large - scale near - ir _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) imaging until recently ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for early progress towards this goal at @xmath8 ; @xcite explores this in more depth ) .",
    "a not inconsiderable challenge in achieving this goal is the definition of what constitutes star - forming or quiescent galaxies . at a given stellar mass",
    ", the sfr of galaxies depends strongly on redshift , evolving by a factor of 510 by @xmath13 and another factor of 4 or so out to @xmath8 @xcite . noting that the 1@xmath14 scatter in sfr at a given stellar mass for the vast majority of star - forming galaxies is @xmath5dex @xcite",
    ", one could choose to define a quiescent galaxy as one that has a sfr more than 1@xmath14 below the star forming galaxy locus at the redshift of interest , and a star - forming galaxy as any galaxy forming stars at a higher rate .",
    "an alternative approach is to separate galaxies by their optical  near - ir colors ( e.g. , @xmath15/@xmath16 ; @xcite , @xcite ) , where galaxies dominated by old stellar populations are distinguishable from star - forming galaxies with even substantial dust reddening ( as used by e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in this paper ,",
    "we adopt both techniques .",
    "we note that a galaxy at @xmath8 which is defined as quiescent according to these two criteria may have a sfr considerably in excess of almost all star - forming disk galaxies at the present day .",
    "while this means that our sample of quiescent galaxies does not have identical properties across all redshifts , it does isolate a sample of galaxies with unusually low sfrs at that epoch given their stellar masses ( confirmed by 24 stacking )  one would like to understand why their sfrs are unusually low at that epoch .    in this paper , we explore the evolution of the structures of galaxies as a function of redshift , and how they relate to the star formation activity in those galaxies .",
    "we use new near - infrared imaging from the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _ hst _ taken as part of the cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ) multi - cycle treasury program @xcite , focusing on the @xmath17 galaxy population in the ukirt ir deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) ultradeep survey ( uds ;  [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "these data allow us to explore the structure of the @xmath18 galaxy population in the rest - frame optical to @xmath19 .",
    "we supplement this with data from the sloan digital sky survey data release 2 @xcite to connect with the properties of local galaxies .",
    "we perform two basic analyses to explore the evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "first , we explore the evolution of the galaxy population drawn from an ` equivalent ' constant comoving volume as a function of redshift to get a sense of how the star formation and structural properties of the galaxy population evolve with cosmic epoch (  [ sec : evol ] ) .",
    "second , we explore the relationship between the structural parameters of galaxies and their star formation activity using the full sample at each epoch ( to maximize number statistics ) , in an attempt to understand which structural parameters best correlate with a lack of star formation activity (  [ sec : param ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we use vega magnitudes for rest - frame colors , assume that every star ever formed does so according to a universally - applicable @xcite stellar imf , and assume h@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "our sample definition and selection is based on the public @xmath23-band selected photometric and photometric redshift catalog produced by @xcite .",
    "we adopt these redshifts in this paper as the basis for conversion of apparent magnitudes into rest - frame colors , magnitudes and stellar masses , and the conversion of apparent to physical sizes .",
    "the @xcite catalog uses @xmath24 and @xmath23-band data for the ukidds uds data release 1 @xcite in conjunction with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28-band imaging from the sxds @xcite and 3.6 and 4.5 irac imaging data taken as part of the swire survey @xcite .",
    "total fluxes were calculated using an elliptical @xcite aperture , and observed - frame fluxes were calculated using a matched 1@xmath2975 circular aperture on psf - matched images ( with the obvious exception of the poorer resolution irac imaging data , whose fluxes were measured in 3@xmath30 apertures and aperture corrected to the smaller aperture size ) .",
    "finally , @xcite used the eazy photometric redshift code @xcite to estimate photometric redshift from the photometric catalogs .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts for the uds are relatively few in number and preferentially focus on brighter sources ; for sources with @xmath31 , the redshift normalized median absolute deviation ( the median absolute deviation , renormalized to give the same value as the rms of a gaussian distribution ) of @xmath32 is @xmath33 with 8% catastrophic outliers @xcite . we have also compared the @xcite photometric redshifts against those of s.  wuyts et al .",

    "we have confirmed that use of the photometric redshifts , @xmath36-corrections and stellar masses from wuyts et al .  instead of the public @xcite photometric redshifts plus the rest - frame colors and masses reported here yields no significant changes to our results .",
    "to explore the structure and morphology of the @xmath17 galaxy population , we use near - infrared f160w imaging from _ hst _ using wfc3 .",
    "candels is a _",
    "hst _ multi - cycle treasury program ( pis : s. faber & h. ferguson , pid : go-12060 ) to image five fields on the sky using the wfc3 and advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "the candels imaging of the uds field includes 2/3 orbit in f125w and 4/3 orbits in f160w , split into two epochs ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "a total of 44 wfc3 tiles were imaged in the uds ; when these are cross - matched with the @xcite catalog , a total of @xmath37 square degrees is covered .",
    "we use also 24 flux as a diagnostic to aid in the separation between galaxies with active star formation and those with little or no star formation .",
    "we use 24 public data from the spuds survey of the uds .",
    "psf fitting photometry with a 13@xmath30 radius was performed , aperture corrected to total flux ; the limiting flux of the catalog is @xmath38jy at the @xmath39 completeness ( or @xmath40 level ) , and uncertainties in 24 flux are of order @xmath41% ( largely reflecting uncertainties in converting aperture to total flux , and source confusion ) .",
    "the rest - frame magnitudes and stellar masses used in this paper were calculated using a set of template spectral energy distributions from the pgase stellar population models ( see @xcite for a description of an earlier version of this stellar population model ) .",
    "such models give similar results to those of @xcite but stellar masses @xmath42dex higher than the models by @xcite .",
    "these stellar population templates have solar metallicity ( as would be approximately expected for galaxies in the mass range @xmath43 ; @xcite ) , and we fit for dust attenuation as a free parameter following @xcite , with values of gas @xmath44 between @xmath45 and 1.5 ( to provide a little flexibility to fit negative attenuation to account for small photometry problems , etc . ; in practice small negative attenuation values are rare in the fits presented here ) .",
    "the templates include a broad range of exponentially - decreasing , constant or exponentially rising star formation histories , beginning at @xmath46 ( see @xcite for a discussion of the importance of exponentially rising star formation histories for fitting @xmath47 seds ) .",
    "the templates treat the evolving galaxy population self - consistently , in the sense that all the galaxies that are in the @xmath48 template set also appear in , e.g. , the @xmath49 or @xmath50 template sets further along their evolutionary path .",
    "thus , the galaxy population at lower redshifts is required to have substantial older stellar populations , driving up somewhat the typical age of the stars and the typical stellar mass - to - light ratio at a given color .",
    "this is to be contrasted with other codes ( e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) which have redshift - independent template sets , but exclude those templates that start star formation before the big bang  the typical stellar populations of galaxies with this type of template fit end up being significantly younger than in the method discussed here .",
    "it is unclear to us at this stage which method is more realistic ; we will explore this issue with star formation histories drawn from a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation in a future paper ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a version of this exercise at higher redshift ) .",
    "these templates were compared with photometric data points of each galaxy , given the photometric redshift value from @xcite , and the template with the smallest @xmath51 was used to calculate rest - frame magnitudes and the stellar m / l ratio .",
    "rest - frame magnitudes were calculated by using the sed shape of the template to work out the predicted rest - frame magnitude of the object given the two nearest observed - frame bands , and then performing a weighted average of those two estimates of rest - frame magnitude .",
    "stellar masses were estimated using the stellar m / ls of the best - fitting template , referenced to the three longest observed wavelengths for overall normalization .",
    "we note that the inclusion of dust , while it improves the quality of sed fit , leads to only modest changes in the rest - frame colors and stellar masses of the sample explored in this paper , given the overall degeneracy between the effects of dust extinction and stellar population age in the optical  near  ir spectral region @xcite .    .",
    "overplotted in gray are the colors of the stars - only template ( thick gray line ) , dust extinction ( @xmath52 ; included in the fitting , thin light gray lines ) .",
    "the filters were chosen to have wavelengths similar to rest - frame @xmath53 at the redshift of interest .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] , width=302 ]    an illustration of this technique is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] , where we show observed - frame colors for galaxies with inferred stellar masses in excess of @xmath54 with spectroscopic ( diamonds with black error bars ) or photometric ( thin grey error bars ) redshifts in the goods south field ( we use this field for this example , as it has many more spectroscopic redshifts in this range ; the photometric redshift sample from uds shows the same trends ) .",
    "overplotted with a thick gray line is the sequence of model composite stellar populations .",
    "thin light gray lines show dust attenuation vectors corresponding to @xmath52 .",
    "as described above , we fit these stellar population models with dust attenuation as a free parameter .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies are well - explained by the template set ; note that those few that are not covered completely by the template set are still assigned rest - frame magnitudes that reflect the observed magnitudes ( and therefore also lie off the template rest - frame colors in a similar way ) , as the observed magnitudes are used to determine rest - frame magnitudes , in conjunction with a small template - dependent correction .",
    "this method , when applied to galaxies with independently - estimated stellar masses ( from independent photometry of similar but not identical datasets ) in this field ( s.  wuyts et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , the goods - s field @xcite , or the cosmos field @xcite yields similar masses for intensely star - forming galaxies and masses @xmath55 dex larger for more dusty star - forming galaxies or non - star - forming galaxies ( as the templates used here are more dominated by older stellar populations than the those used by @xcite or @xcite ) , with a scatter of 0.2 dex .",
    "rest - frame colors are reproduced to within 0.1 mag . when this method is compared with the masses of @xcite , calculated on identical photometry and using a more restricted set of stellar population models without dust ,",
    "there is no offset and 0.07 dex scatter in stellar masses , and a scatter of less than 0.05 mag in rest - frame @xmath15 colors .",
    "we adopt the stellar mass estimates described above for the purposes of this paper to ensure consistency of the stellar mass estimation method and stellar mass scale as a function of redshift ( the same code was used to estimate stellar masses at all redshifts , and the choice of templates evolves consistently from redshift to redshift ) .",
    "we have confirmed that the systematic discrepancies in stellar mass between the masses adopted here and those by , e.g. , @xcite would operate to strengthen our conclusions ( or in the case of the second part of the paper , leave them unaffected ) ; their stellar masses for @xmath56 galaxies are systematically lower by up to a factor of 2 , with a factor of 2 scatter , and the evolution of the population would appear more rapid than it appears in this paper .    in what follows",
    "we adopt a mass limit of @xmath2 ; the sample is ` complete ' above this limit .",
    "completeness , often meant to signify the limit above which no galaxies are missing as a result of selection , is not straightforward to calculate for multi - band photometric redshift surveys , as the magnitude limits in the different optical / near  ir bands limit the recovery of photometric redshifts and stellar masses in ways that are spectral type and redshift - dependent .",
    "@xcite argue the 5@xmath14 @xmath23-band survey limit corresponds to a stellar mass limit of @xmath57 ; they analyze their sample to a limit of @xmath58 to ensure accurate uds - derived galaxy size estimates ( for which higher @xmath59 is required ) .",
    "we choose to analyze the sample to @xmath60 .",
    "given that completeness is such a challenge to calulate , we have tested this limit empirically by repeating the analyses in this paper on an independent , currently proprietary set of magnitudes , photometric redshifts , rest - frame magnitudes and stellar masses drawn from deeper imaging data ( s.  wuyts et al .",

    "galapagos estimates the sky value explicitly on larger scales , leading to more robust fits given typical image cutout sizes ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of testing of our method using both simulated and deeper data ; a.  van der wel in prep .",
    "demonstrate that the uncertainty in fit parameters caused by sky estimation errors in this particular dataset are substantially smaller than the uncertainties that we adopt below from comparison of independent srsic fits ) .",
    "the srsic index @xmath65 describes the shape of the light profile , where @xmath66 corresponds to an exponential light profile and @xmath67 corresponds to a @xmath68 law profile characteristic of massive , spheroid - dominated early - type galaxies .",
    "the srsic parameter @xmath65 is a reasonably good proxy for the ratio of bulge luminosity to total luminosity , as illustrated in fig .",
    "14 of @xcite  systems with high @xmath65 invariably host a prominent bulge , whereas systems with low @xmath65 host a weak or no bulge component .",
    "at the depths typical of this imaging , uncertainties in the fit parameters are @xmath69dex , @xmath70% , and @xmath71 , as constrained from both fits of simulated galaxies and independent galfits to f125w imaging of a subsample of @xmath72 galaxies in the uds @xcite .",
    "the srsic fits adopted in this paper are carried out on the f160w imaging data of candels .",

    "a possible concern is that this change in rest - frame wavelength may affect the demographics of the population .",
    "while the full dataset at shorter wavelengths in the uds field has not been analyzed with galfit , it is possible to test if this may be an issue using galfit on a smaller set of candels f160w data in the goods south area , in comparison with published galfits on the f850lp acs gems data for the extended chandra deep field south @xcite .",
    "we choose galaxies with @xmath75 for this test , where the f850lp data span the same range in rest - frame wavelength as the f160w data for @xmath76 . for systems with low @xmath77",
    ", we find a slight tendency for the f160w srsic index to exceed the f850lp data ( by @xmath78 dex ) , and for @xmath79 there is no systematic difference between the two sets of srsic fits .",

    "the fraction of systems with @xmath80 in f850lp ( restframe @xmath81 ) is in fact 20% _ larger _ than the fraction derived using the f160w imaging ( restframe @xmath82 ) .",

    "we show examples of such systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfstmp ] in 5 different redshift bins .",
    "one can see that these high srsic index , star - forming systems fall broadly into two types of systems . at lower redshifts , there are some clear examples of disks with very prominent bulges ; such galaxies appear to be the star - forming counterparts of the quiescent disks discussed above , and appear to be systems that have either retained , or ` re - grown ' , a substantial disk during / after the bulge formation process @xcite . at all redshifts , there are what appear to be genuinely spheroidal galaxies , but in many cases with significant asymmetries , and in some cases evidence of interactions ( e.g. , nearby companions , tidal tails ) .",
    "it will be interesting to examine such systems in the future to understand the degree of overlap between these systems and ` blue spheroids ' @xcite , post - starburst galaxies @xcite , or ongoing ` bulge - building ' starbursts @xcite and to ask if the properties of these galaxies are more consistent with an interpretation as a quiescent galaxy in formation , a galaxy in the midst of bulge building through instabilities in the stellar disk and cold inflowing gas @xcite , or a galaxy in the early stages of re - growing a disk @xcite .",
    "there are a number of possible future directions for pursuing this line of study further .",
    "a clear improvement path involves the use of more accurate photometric spectroscopic redshifts , which helps improve both the accuracy and reliability of redshift and stellar population estimates , and opens up possibilities to measure low - resolution spectral parameters like the 4000 break strength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further sharpening the analysis would be possible with the addition of reliable bulge / disk decompositions : the hypothesis that the existence of a prominent bulge is necessary but not sufficient to shut off star formation can be better tested , and additional parameters can be explored for possible relevance ( e.g. , bulge / total ratio , bulge srsic index , or bulge mass ; see , e.g. , @xcite for an exploration of some of these issues with a low - redshift sample , or v.  bruce et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "more detailed exploration of the outliers at all redshifts ( the quiescent lower srsic index systems , or star - forming systems with high srsic index ) may help to illuminate the processes that remove ( or keep out ) cold gas from galaxies .",
    "finally , increasing the number statistics at @xmath112 ( already underway with , e.g. , the gems , aegis or cosmos datasets ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and at @xmath126 with the full five - field coverage of candels @xcite is likely to prove useful .",
    "motivated by a desire to empirically explore the evolutionary factors that lead to a lack of star formation in galaxies , we have explored the structures and star formation activity of the galaxy population using the _",
    "hst_/wfc3 f160w imaging data from candels in the uds field .",
    "we used public photometry and photometric redshifts from @xcite , and determined rest - frame absolute magnitudes and stellar masses using our own stellar population model fits .",
    "we supplement this with public 24 data from spuds , and separate galaxies into quiescent and star - forming using a combination of optical  near - infrared colors and 24 information . for structural information ,",
    "we use parametric fits of a single srsic profile to the wfc3 f160w imaging data .",
    "we then combine these data for @xmath56 galaxies with a sample with similar parameters from the sdss , to create a @xmath92 comparison sample .",
    "we then proceed to explore the evolution of the @xmath43 galaxy population from @xmath1 to the present day .",
    "we first visualize the evolution of the galaxy population over the last 10gyr by normalizing the sample to a ` fixed ' comoving volume of @xmath163 mpc@xmath164 . in agreement with a large number of other works , we find that the number density of galaxies with stellar mass in excess of @xmath2 increases approximately five - fold from @xmath8 to the present day , and that the number density of quiescent galaxies increases yet more rapidly .",
    "furthermore , examining the properties of the quiescent galaxy population , we find that the vast majority of those quiescent galaxies have high srsic indices ( and , at @xmath142 , high inferred velocity dispersion and surface density ) , a sign that they have a prominent bulge component .",
    "the growth of the quiescent galaxy population appears to be intimately linked with the growth of galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "given the rapid evolution of the quiescent galaxy population , we proceed to explore the strength of the correlation between quiescence and four galaxy / structural parameters : stellar mass , ` velocity dispersion ' @xmath165 with a srsic index - dependent scaling , stellar surface density and srsic index .",
    "at all redshifts @xmath152 , stellar mass correlates poorly with quiescence .",
    "it is possible , bearing in mind the inferred @xmath166dex scatter between stellar mass and dark matter halo mass at @xmath167 @xcite , that the weakness of this correlation indicates that halo mass _ alone _ is not the main determinant of quiescence ( but see also @xcite and @xcite for arguments that velocity dispersion correlates with halo mass better than stellar mass , at least at high stellar mass ) .    at @xmath168 , we find that quiescence correlates much more strongly with srsic index than either velocity dispersion or surface density . at @xmath169 , we find that velocity dispersion , surface density and srsic index correlate well with quiescence , where the correlation of srsic index with quiescence appears marginally stronger .",
    "all correlations have substantial scatter , however .",
    "many quiescent systems have prominent disks , although the vast majority of quiescent galaxies with disks also have prominent bulges .",
    "a very small fraction of quiescent galaxies appear to be bulgeless disks . in the local universe",
    "they are all satellite galaxies in galaxy groups / clusters ; at higher redshifts we did not explore environmental variables for lack of dynamic range in galaxy environments ( see r. bassett et al . in preparation for first steps in this direction using the candels dataset ) .",
    "star - forming systems with high @xmath65 , @xmath170 , @xmath125 and @xmath124 are not particularly uncommon ; at high redshifts they appear to be genuinely compact with high @xmath65 , and often show asymmetries or signatures of tidal interactions ( one may wish to associate these with the possible remnants of gas - rich dissipational galaxy interactions / mergers ) , and at lower redshifts there is a mix of similar systems and composite bulge - disk star - forming systems ( with large bulges ) .    at @xmath92 , @xcite concluded that a prominent bulge ( and by association , a supermassive black hole ) was a necessary but not sufficient condition for a galaxy to turn off its own star formation on galaxy - wide scales ( all quiescent galaxies in the centers of their own halos had prominent bulges , but not all galaxies with bulges lack star formation ) . this observational association is qualitatively consistent with the agn feedback paradigm ( no supermassive black hole , no ability to shut off star formation ) .",
    "while there is clearly scope for further investigation of the drivers of quiescence , the evidence assembled here appears to be consistent with this proposition to @xmath152 , a time interval of more than 10gyr .",
