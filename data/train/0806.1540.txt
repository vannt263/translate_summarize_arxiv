    "given a model category @xmath1 and any small category @xmath2 , one can form the category @xmath3 $ ] of functors from @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is cofibrantly generated , this category of diagrams inherits a model structure . a basic question is then to determine when two such model categories of diagrams in @xmath1 are quillen equivalent . in this article",
    "we develop an approach to this problem for the case when @xmath1 shares characteristics common to abelian and stable model categories .",
    "precisely , in both types of categories the natural map @xmath4 is an equivalence of the right kind : an isomorphism in the abelian case and a weak equivalence in the stable case .",
    "suitably generalized , this leads to the notion of a _ semi - stable model category_.    the ideas of classical morita theory have been used for some time now in describing equivalences of categories of functors ; an early example may be found in @xcite .",
    "more recently , somiska has developed a robust set of sufficient conditions that yield morita equivalences for categories of functors taking values in @xmath0-modules @xcite . up to this point , such work has been primarily an algebraist s affair .",
    "our approach is to deduce a morita theorem for diagrams in a semi - stable model category by suitably adapting a portion of somiska s framework .    the genesis of both somiska s original work and our current homotopy - theoretic version may be found in the results of pirashvili in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the category with objects the sets @xmath6 and with the surjective maps as the morphisms ( where @xmath7 is the empty set ) .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the category with objects the finite based sets @xmath9 and morphisms the based maps , where @xmath10 acts as the basepoint .",
    "paraphrased , pirashvili proves in @xcite that the functor categories @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 $ ] are equivalent when @xmath1 is an abelian category .",
    "the equivalence is given by the cross effect construction of eilenberg and maclane in @xcite .",
    "at about the same time , similar equivalences were being noticed in stable homotopy theory , again arising from a ( homotopical ) cross effect .",
    "the categories @xmath5 and @xmath8 appear together in several instances , such as in @xcite and @xcite . in his work on generalizations of the infinite symmetric product to categories of @xmath13-algebras , kuhn @xcite explicitly mentions an apparent connection to pirashvili s algebraic equivalence of categories .",
    "all of this suggests that the categories @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 $ ] are quillen equivalent when @xmath1 is a stable model category .",
    "this is indeed the case , as proven and generalized in the author s doctoral dissertation ( independent of the work of somiska ) .    at this point",
    "it is an attractive idea to attempt to unify the algebraic theorem with the stable homotopy analogue .",
    "this is the motivation for considering semi - stable model categories : our main result proves both theorems at once .",
    "hence en route to the proof of the stable homotopy result we recover the abelian case as well , but we do so via model - categorical methods .",
    "while we would never maintain that the techniques of model categories are a more sensible approach to abelian category questions , the point is that we can prove the stable homotopy version of the theorem while capturing the similarities between these disparate classes of categories .",
    "somiska s morita theory @xcite is a generalization of the behavior exhibited by the categories @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "she gives conditions on pairs @xmath14 of small categories enriched over @xmath0-modules so that there is an adjoint equivalence between @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "suitably enriched , the pair @xmath17 is an example of such a morita equivalent pair of small categories .",
    "not only does this succeed in recovering pirashvili s theorem ( at least for the category of @xmath0-modules ) , it also lends itself to numerous additional examples .    in this article",
    "we give similar conditions on pairs @xmath14 of small categories so that the associated functor categories @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] are quillen equivalent when @xmath1 is semi - stable . like",
    "somiska s work , this is achieved by abstracting certain relations between the categories @xmath5 and @xmath8 , although we take a different approach necessitated by the non - additive nature of model categories . in somiska",
    "s framework all categories and functors were additive , and because of",
    "this we will necessarily lose a couple of her examples .",
    "fortunately , the main feature of the pair @xmath17 to be generalized is not hard to describe .",
    "in fact , it closely parallels the first isomorphism theorem in group theory .",
    "every @xmath8-map @xmath20 admits a uniquely determined three - fold factorization @xmath21 \\obj(-9,8)[1]{${\\mathbf{m}_+}$ } \\obj(9,8)[2]{${\\mathbf{n}_+}$ } \\obj(-9,-8)[3]{${\\mathbf{r}_+}$ } \\obj(9,-8)[4]{${\\mathbf{s}_+}$ } \\mor{1}{2}{$\\gamma$ } \\mor{3}{4}{$\\alpha$ } \\mor{1}{3}{$q$}[\\atright , \\solidarrow ] \\mor{4}{2}{$i$}[\\atright , \\solidarrow ] \\enddc\\ ] ] where    * @xmath22 is the quotient map that collapses the  kernel \" @xmath23 of @xmath24 , * @xmath25 represents the inclusion of the image of @xmath24 into its codomain , and * @xmath26 is the unique epimorphism making the diagram commute .",
    "note that @xmath26 has the additional property that only the basepoint is mapped to the basepoint .",
    "thus we may forget the basepoints and view @xmath26 as a morphism @xmath27 in @xmath5 .",
    "thus we see that every @xmath8-map gives rise to a uniquely determined map in @xmath5 , and we can keep track of this assignment by recording the  cokernel \" @xmath22 and the inclusion map @xmath25 . furthermore , note that the category of inclusion maps is in some sense dual to the category of quotients .",
    "abstracting all of this structure leads to our notion of a _",
    "conjugate pair _ of small categories , of which @xmath17 is the prime example .",
    "this is made precise in section  [ conj_pair_section ] .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to show that every conjugate pair is in fact a morita equivalent pair of small categories in the semi - stable setting . paraphrasing to avoid some currently undefined notation",
    ", our main result asserts the following :    suppose that @xmath1 is a model category .",
    "every conjugate pair @xmath14 of small categories gives rise to an adjoint pair @xmath21 \\obj(-12,0)[1]{$[{\\mathcal{b}}^{\\mathrm{op } } , { \\mathcal{c}}]$ } \\obj(12,0)[2]{$[{\\mathcal{a}}^{\\mathrm{op } } , { \\mathcal{c}}]$ } \\obj(-8,1)[3 ] { } \\obj(8,1)[4 ] { } \\obj(-8,-1)[5 ] { } \\obj(8,-1)[6 ] { } \\mor{3}{4}{${\\mathcal{l}}$ } \\mor{6}{5}{${\\mathcal{r}}$ } \\enddc\\ ] ] and this is a quillen equivalence when @xmath1 is semi - stable .",
    "this article is a generalization of several results found in the author s doctoral dissertation , written under the direction of prof .",
    "nicholas kuhn at the university of virginia .",
    "we are grateful for all the helpful suggestions he has offered .",
    "in section  [ morita_subsection ] we lay our foundation for morita equivalence for categories of functors .",
    "we will take classical morita theory as inspiration for both the terminology and the notation .",
    "section  [ mod_cat_subsection ] sets in stone some blanket technical assumptions we must impose on model categories for the purposes of this paper , and cofibrant generation is quickly reviewed . in section  [ stable_subsection ]",
    "we give the definition of a _ semi - stable model category_.    in section  [ index_cat_sect ] we begin the development of the small category side of the story , where we carefully define the notion of an _ indexing category_. such categories will play the role of the category of inclusions in the three - fold factorizations .",
    "this type of category will also index some fundamental ( co)product decompositions , hence the name .",
    "section  [ conj_pair_section ] formalizes three - fold factorization to the notion of a _",
    "conjugate pair _ of small categories ; plenty of examples follow in section  [ examples_section ] .",
    "the bulk of the hard work lies in section  [ nat_section ] , where we show that a conjugate pair allows for the creation of a special functor , called the _",
    "regular bimodule_. here , the term _ bimodule _ means a functor of the form @xmath28 ( we are using @xmath29 to denote the category of based sets ) .",
    "the regular bimodule conveniently encodes many naturality properties which are necessary for the proof of our theorem , and these are detailed in section  [ nat_section ] .",
    "every bimodule creates an adjoint pair between functor categories . for a regular bimodule",
    ", the resulting right adjoint admits a nice product decomposition ; this is the content of section  [ adjoint_section ] . in section  [ free_section ]",
    ", we analyze the behavior of free functors and their pushouts under this adjunction .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to proving theorem  [ main_thm ] , our main result .",
    "for this discussion , let us fix a pointed category @xmath1 having all limits and colimits . in the applications in this article , @xmath1 will always be a pointed model category .",
    "the constructions involved in our morita theory naturally arise from products and coproducts indexed by based sets . as an initial technicality we must be clear about how we will handle the basepoint .",
    "given a based set @xmath13 and an object @xmath30 of @xmath1 , the product @xmath31 will always stand for the ordinary product of copies of @xmath30 , one copy for each non - basepoint element of @xmath13 .",
    "that is , the factor corresponding to the basepoint of @xmath13 will always be taken to be the zero object of @xmath1 .",
    "the same convention applies to coproducts @xmath32 indexed by based sets ( as all of our categories will be pointed , we will be using the wedge symbol @xmath33 for the coproduct )",
    ". it will be convenient to denote @xmath32 by @xmath34 on occasion .",
    "let us now fix a small category @xmath35 .",
    "given functors @xmath36 and @xmath37 we can form a new functor @xmath38 by the assignment @xmath39 we define @xmath40 to be the end of this functor ( see @xcite for a refresher on ends , if necessary ) .",
    "we are writing @xmath35 as a superscript to distinguish this from a set of morphisms in a category .",
    "it is entirely formal that this construction has all of the expected properties of a @xmath41-like object : functoriality of the expected variances , correct behavior with ( co)products , and a yoneda lemma .",
    "for example , if @xmath42 is a representable ( think : free ) functor , we have a natural isomorphism @xmath43 .    likewise",
    ", we can use coends of coproducts to define a tensor product of functors .",
    "fix a small category @xmath44 and functors @xmath45 and @xmath46 . from this",
    "we can form a functor @xmath47 via @xmath48 the coend of which we denote @xmath49 . again , this has all of the expected properties of a tensor product .    the starting point in classical morita theory",
    "is the simple fact that every bimodule gives an adjoint pair between categories of modules . in our situation , every functor of the form @xmath28 will give rise to an adjoint pair between categories of contravariant functors ; we will therefore call such functors _ bimodules_.    to that end , fix a bimodule @xmath28 .",
    "our @xmath50 and @xmath51 constructions yield an adjoint pair @xmath21 \\obj(-12,0)[1]{$[{\\mathcal{b}}^{\\mathrm{op } } , { \\mathcal{c}}]$ } \\obj(12,0)[2]{$[{\\mathcal{a}}^{\\mathrm{op } } , { \\mathcal{c}}]$ } \\obj(-8,1)[3 ] { } \\obj(8,1)[4 ] { } \\obj(-8,-1)[5 ] { } \\obj(8,-1)[6 ] { } \\mor{3}{4}{${\\mathcal{l}}$ } \\mor{6}{5}{${\\mathcal{r}}$ } \\enddc\\ ] ] described as follows .",
    "given @xmath45 we define the functor @xmath52 by @xmath53 dually , given @xmath36 we define @xmath54 by @xmath55 it is entirely formal that @xmath56 is an adjoint pair .",
    "all of the quillen equivalences in our work will arise from this type of adjunction .",
    "we will take as the root definition of _ model category _ that which is set forth in chapter 1 of hovey s _ model categories _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will assume that the functorial factorizations are fixed as part of the underlying model structure ( others assume that such factorizations merely exist ) .",
    "we will also be required to make some additional technical assumptions . for brevity s sake",
    ", we will bundle these assumptions into the term _",
    "model category_.    [ conv ] in this paper , the term _ model category _ shall always mean a pointed , cofibrantly generated model category @xmath1 as in @xcite , possessing the following additional properties :    * @xmath1 is proper .",
    "* the projections @xmath57 are always fibrations . *",
    "if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are acyclic fibrations then the map @xmath60 is a weak equivalence . *",
    "if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are acyclic cofibrations then the map @xmath61 is a weak equivalence .    for the most part these assumptions are fairly mild .",
    "the properness assumption will guarantee that we have well - behaved homotopy pullbacks and pushouts , as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 ) .",
    "note that all projections will be fibrations whenever all objects in @xmath1 are fibrant .",
    "we also gain the following two results which will be needed in section  [ adjoint_section ] .",
    "[ prod_fib ] whenever @xmath58 and @xmath59 are fibrations , so is the map @xmath62 .    since @xmath63 and @xmath64 are fibrations , so are @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the result follows since products of fibrations are fibrations .",
    "[ prod_weq ] let @xmath1 be a model category in which the natural map @xmath4 is a weak equivalence for all cofibrant objects @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "suppose that @xmath69 and @xmath30 are cofibrant objects .",
    "then maps @xmath58 and @xmath59 are weak equivalences if and only if @xmath70 is a weak equivalence .    the  if \" direction ( @xmath71 ) follows directly from the retract axiom in a general model category .",
    "for the other implication , suppose that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are weak equivalences .",
    "we may factor @xmath72 and @xmath73 as cofibrations followed by acyclic fibrations , say @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are necessarily weak equivalences , and that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are cofibrant .",
    "we now have a commutative diagram @xmath21 \\obj(-12,8)[1]{$a \\vee c$ } \\obj(12,8)[2]{$b ' \\vee d'$ } \\obj(-12,-8)[3]{$a \\times c$ } \\obj(12,-8)[4]{$b ' \\times d'$ } \\obj(0,-20)[5]{$b \\times d$ } \\mor{1}{2}{$(1)$ } \\mor{1}{3}{$(2)$}[\\atright , \\solidarrow ] \\mor{2}{4}{$(3)$ } \\mor{3}{5}{$(4)$}[\\atright , \\solidarrow ] \\mor{4}{5}{$(5)$ } \\enddc\\ ] ] in which map ( 4 ) is the map in question . maps ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) are weak equivalences by our conventions , while maps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are weak equivalences by hypothesis .",
    "hence map ( 4 ) is a weak equivalence , as desired .",
    "we close this section with a few remarks about cofibrant generation and categories of functors ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) for complete details .",
    "when @xmath1 is a cofibrantly generated model category , the category @xmath80 $ ] of functors @xmath81 inherits a model structure ( here @xmath2 can be any small category ) .",
    "this model structure is also cofibrantly generated , and weak equivalences and fibrations of diagrams are defined objectwise .",
    "we will need a complete description of the cofibrations .",
    "fix an object @xmath82 of @xmath2 and an object @xmath30 of @xmath1 .",
    "the _ free functor _ generated by @xmath82 and @xmath30 is the functor @xmath83 given by @xmath84    clearly every map @xmath85 in @xmath1 induces a natural transformation @xmath86 of free functors .",
    "when @xmath1 is cofibrantly generated , the cofibrations in @xmath80 $ ] are generated by the maps of the form @xmath86 , where @xmath25 is a generating cofibration of @xmath1 .",
    "thus all cofibrations in the category of diagrams are obtained through transfinite compositions of pushouts of such maps ( and retracts thereof ) .    in order to handle these transfinite compositions , we require one more technical tool before we proceed , namely a reasonable sequential homotopy colimit functor . let @xmath1 be a model category and fix an ordinal @xmath87 . by a _ @xmath87-sequence _ in @xmath1 we mean a functor @xmath88 , where @xmath87 is made into a category in the usual way .",
    "since @xmath1 is cofibrantly generated , the category @xmath89 $ ] of all such sequences inherits a model structure with objectwise weak equivalences and fibrations .",
    "this is even true if @xmath1 is not cofibrantly generated , though we will not need this fact . in this model structure ,",
    "a @xmath87-sequence is cofibrant if it is objectwise cofibrant and each map in the diagram is a cofibration ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 4.3 ) .",
    "we will use the letter @xmath90 to denote cofibrant replacement . according to hirschhorn in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 17.9.1 ) , the map @xmath91 is a weak equivalence whenever @xmath92 is a weak equivalence of cofibrant @xmath87-sequences .",
    "this of course implies that the natural map @xmath93 is a weak equivalence whenever @xmath67 is a cofibrant @xmath87-sequence .",
    "one would like to define the homotopy colimit of a @xmath87-sequence @xmath67 as the colimit of its cofibrant replacement .",
    "this turns out to be fine for objects , but some care must be taken with the morphisms .",
    "we remark that cofibrant replacements of objects are well - defined since the functorial factorizations are fixed as part of the model structure . however , cofibrant replacements of _ maps _ are unique only up to ( left ) homotopy . by passing to the homotopy category",
    "@xmath94 , this problem is remedied .",
    "[ hocolim ] forming colimits of cofibrant replacements yields a well - defined functor @xmath95 \\rightarrow { \\mathrm{ho}}({\\mathcal{c}})$ ] . if @xmath67 is a cofibrant @xmath87-sequence , the natural map @xmath96 is an isomorphism in the homotopy category .",
    "we can now describe the properties model categories must have in order to develop our morita equivalences .",
    "it is helpful to keep in mind that each axiom below is a statement about the equivalence of finite products and coproducts .",
    "we say that a model category @xmath1 is _ semi - stable _ if the following product - coproduct coherence axioms are satisfied :    * * the lower triangular axiom : * suppose that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are cofibrant objects and that the map @xmath99 has components @xmath100 .",

    "note that these axioms are definitely one - sided and not self - dual .",
    "this is intentional .",
    "we will see that the right adjoint in our quillen equivalence always admits a product decomposition , but in general the left adjoint does not admit a corresponding coproduct formula .    by applying the lower triangular axiom to the  identity matrix , \"",
    "it is immediate that proposition  [ prod_weq ] holds in any semi - stable model category .",
    "every complete and cocomplete abelian category admits the structure of a semi - stable model category .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is abelian with all limits and colimits .",
    "it is well - known that declaring the weak equivalences to be the isomorphisms gives a model structure on @xmath1 ( and here , every map is both a fibration and a cofibration ) . in this case , all  homotopy adjectives \" become vacuous .",
    "it is immediate that all parts of convention  [ conv ] are satisfied .",
    "moreover , pushout - product and colimit - product coherence follow from the fact that the natural map @xmath105 is always an isomorphism .    for the lower triangular axiom ,",
    "suppose that @xmath106 is such a map with @xmath107 and @xmath82 isomorphisms .",
    "we can write down the inverse of @xmath72 explicitly as @xmath108 as one can check .",
    "hence the lower triangular axiom holds and @xmath1 is semi - stable .",
    "many stable model categories also satisfy the axioms for a semi - stability .",
    "recall that a pointed model category is _ stable _ if its homotopy category is triangulated under its natural loop and suspension . for a definition that avoids reference to the homotopy category",
    ", mark hovey points out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) that this is equivalent to the coincidence of homotopy pullback and pushout squares in the underlying model category .",
    "hence pushout - product coherence is to be expected as products and pullbacks interact nicely .",
    "the third axiom will follow whenever products of weak equivalences are weak equivalences and so are the maps @xmath4 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 are cofibrant .",
    "[ lower_triang_prop ] the lower triangular axiom holds in any stable model category in which all objects are fibrant .",

    "as @xmath97 and @xmath98 are cofibrant , the top row is a homotopy cofiber sequence in the homotopy category . likewise , since all objects are fibrant , the bottom row is a homotopy fiber sequence .",
    "of course in the homotopy category , fiber and cofiber sequences coincide .",
    "since @xmath110 and @xmath111 are weak equivalences , we now have a map of fiber sequences that is an isomorphism on the fiber and the base .",
    "thus @xmath72 represents an isomorphism in the homotopy category , and is therefore a weak equivalence .",
    "the simplest example of such a stable model category is the category of chain complexes of @xmath0-modules . here",
    "the weak equivalences are the homology isomorphisms and the fibrations are the surjections . of course this category is also abelian and thus may be regarded as semi - stable with the isomorphisms as the weak equivalences .",
    "our main theorem says something very different in each of these cases .",
    "categories with a certain kind of rigid structure will be instrumental throughout the development of our main result .",
    "the tight structural properties of these categories will give us control over the indexing of crucial ( co)product decompositions .",
    "in essence , these _ indexing categories _ serve to parameterize images and cokernels .    for this , we will need to recall some basic facts about ei - categories .",
