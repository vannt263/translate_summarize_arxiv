    "for most dynamical systems , the feynman path integral admits a continuation to imaginary time , and quantum fluctuations with respect to the classical trajectories are bounded . in certain cases ,",
    "however , the main contributions to the path integral originate from regions of the configuration space which are far from the classical and semiclassical configurations near the stationary point of the action .",
    "situations of this kind have been previously studied by da luz et al .",
    "@xcite for systems with strong constraints or boundary conditions , which lead to a drastic discretization of the configuration space .",
    "a remarkable application is to systems , like `` quantum paths '' , which are of direct practical interest @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will show that a similar `` quantum runaway '' occurs in an apparently harmless system ( but one for which the configuration space is truly infinite - dimensional ) : the massless harmonic oscillator .",
    "we shall start with some simple physical remarks and then turn to the path integral .",
    "let us consider the behavior of an harmonic oscillator in the limit in which the mass @xmath2 goes to zero while the elastic constant @xmath3 remains finite .",
    "we can think of this limit just as a mathematical exercise , or as a way of describing a situation in which a very light particle is bound by a strong potential . in the classical equation of motion",
    ", the limit @xmath0 does not produce any qualitative change of the dynamics .",
    "the frequency of the oscillations tends to infinity , as can be intuitively predicted considering the lack of inertia .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations , however , remains finite ; if the particle starts at rest at some distance from the origin , it remains confined within the same distance , while its velocity at the origin tends to infinity , due to energy conservation .",
    "let us check if the classical limit of zero mass can be described by setting @xmath4 in the action of the particle from the beginning , thus starting with the lagrangian @xmath5 .",
    "the equation of motion obtained by minimizing the action is @xmath6 , or @xmath7 in the presence of an additional external force @xmath8 .",
    "this means that the oscillator just follows the external force , or is at rest at the origin if the external force vanishes .",
    "therefore its behavior is qualitatively different from that obtained taking the limit @xmath0 .",
    "we can conclude that the correct procedure is actually the limit @xmath0 , because a classical non - relativistic dynamics where @xmath4 from the start is ill - defined ( for example , it is impossible to define kinetic energy and momentum of the particle ; in fact the canonical momentum associated to @xmath9 is trivially constrained , etc . ) .    if we introduce some noise into the classical equations , we still obtain reasonable results in the limit @xmath0 . in the presence of thermal noise",
    ", the equipartition principle suggests that the average displacement of the oscillator is finite , independently from the mass , because @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant ; the average velocity tends to infinity as @xmath0 , since @xmath12 .",
    "more in detail , one can write a langevin stochastic equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is for instance a white noise such that @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 is an amplitude with dimension time@xmath17 @xcite . ) then one solves the corresponding fokker - planck equation and looks at its limit for @xmath0 and @xmath3 finite .",
    "stochastic mechanics has often been viewed as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the solution @xmath18 of the fokker - planck equation gives the probability distribution of the stochastic variables . in this case",
    "it is known that the stationary solution is a boltzmann distribution in phase space , namely @xmath19 \\label{lang3}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a normalization factor .",
    "we see from this distribution that in the limit @xmath0 , @xmath21 is limited and @xmath22 is not , as anticipated through the equipartition law .",
    "when we consider the limit @xmath0 , @xmath23 in quantum mechanics , we immediately realize that the behavior of the oscillator becomes singular .",
    "since the frequency tends to infinity , the energy of the ground state also tends to infinity , and so does the difference between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "the average value of @xmath24 in the ground state also tends to infinity , thus the oscillator becomes completely de - localized ; in fact we have @xmath25    the same conclusion can be reached by considering the expressions of the operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 in terms of the adimensional creation / annihilation operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , namely @xmath30{{\\frac{1}{{mk}}}}\\left ( { { a^\\dagger } + a } \\right ) ; \\qquad \\qquad \\hat p = i\\sqrt { \\frac{\\hbar } { 2 } } \\sqrt[4]{{mk}}\\left ( { { a^\\dagger } - a } \\right)\\ ] ] this also shows that the roles of the kinetic and potential term in the divergence of the energy are completely analogous , since when @xmath0 we have @xmath31    any correspondence with a classical system is lost , since glauber s coherent states , usually employed to compute the classical limit of the wave function , can not be defined when @xmath0 .",
    "we could say that the quantum massless harmonic oscillator is a system which does not admit a classical analogue . on the other hand ,",
    "an application of the quantum massless oscillator as a physical system at the atomic or sub - atomic level is very unlikely .",
    "no real physical force can have a potential proportional to @xmath24 up to an infinite distance .",
    "this is usually only an approximation valid near the minimum of the potential , and which makes sense as long as the motion is limited in space ; but this does not happen when the mass of the particle tends to zero .",
    "( we clearly encounter here also an intrinsic limitation of the non - relativistic theory in the description of massless particles . )",
    "at the mathematical level , the massless oscillator represents an elementary system which allows to explore some puzzling properties of path integrals . to this end , let us compute for the oscillator the average of the square of an `` intermediate '' coordinate @xmath32{e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } s\\left [ x \\right ] } } } { x_{int}}^2 } { \\int { d\\left [ x \\right]{e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } s\\left [ x \\right ] } } } }   \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] more precisely , consider an intermediate time @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a given initial time and @xmath36 a final time ) , call @xmath37 the value of the coordinate at the time @xmath33 and compute @xmath38 , with arbitrary boundary conditions @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a quantity of this kind is also called a `` feynman - hibbs transition element '' ; after discretization , the numerator becomes the following ordinary multiple integral over the intermediate coordinates @xmath41 @xmath42{e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } s\\left [ x \\right ] } } } { x_{int}}^2 = \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0 } \\int { \\prod\\limits_{k = 1}^{n - 1 } { d{x_k } } x_{int}^2\\exp \\left\\ { { \\frac{{ik\\delta } } { { 2\\hbar } } \\left [ { - x_i^2 - x_1 ^ 2 ...",

    "we obtain @xmath44 in the continuum limit @xmath45 this is divergent .",
    "this result is not an anomaly of the continuum limit of our system , because other quantities have finite averages . for comparison",
    ", one can evaluate the average of @xmath46 , which still gives a gaussian integral ; one easily obtains a finite result , which vanishes in the continuum limit . on the other hand ,",
    "if we compute the average of a quantity like @xmath47 , which tends to a finite value for large @xmath37 , we obtain a finite and non - zero result in the continuum limit ; to see this , one can exploit the known integral @xmath48 } \\right\\ } + \\frac{{1 - i}}{{\\sqrt a } } \\sqrt \\pi   } \\ ] ] and consider that the `` error function '' erf(@xmath49 ) is finite for @xmath50 , and tends to -1 . in our case @xmath51 , and @xmath45 in the continuum limit .",
    "the normalization factor at the denominator behaves like @xmath52 , therefore for @xmath45 the term @xmath53 gives a finite contribution and the rest goes to zero . in conclusion , the quantum averages computed with the path integral tell us consistently that each intermediate coordinate @xmath37 tends to grow without limit .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the system runs away to large @xmath21 , far from the classical solution .",
    "the crucial question now is : which configurations in the path integral contribute to this divergent result ?",
    "certainly not those near the stationary point of the action , @xmath6 .",
    "our conjecture is that there exist a set of configurations for which @xmath54 , but @xmath55 is not zero , and actually not limited . these are not stationary points of the action in the functional space , but in spite of that they give a sizeable , `` coherent '' contribution to the path integral , because for them @xmath56 is equal to its classical value and the factor @xmath57 is constant .",
    "we call these configurations `` zero - modes '' of the action .",
    "they satisfy the equation @xmath54 , i.e. , in this case @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an arbitrary function with zero integral over the time interval we are considering and @xmath60 is an arbitrary non - zero constant , namely the coefficient of a term proportional to @xmath61 which one is always free to add to the lagrangian .     which has a continuum spectrum plus an integrable spike for some energy value @xmath62 .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) admits runaway solutions which are not limited on any fixed interval and can be properly `` deformed '' through the choice of the function @xmath59 , so that the collection of all these zero - modes of the action makes up a subspace of the configuration space which has non - zero measure ; in other words , these configurations make an effective contribution to the path integral and are in fact responsible for the divergence of mean values like @xmath68 .",
    "it can also be proven that , by contrast , the corresponding zero - modes of an oscillator with @xmath69 are limited in any fixed interval .    , has a minimum at @xmath70 and also stays at its minimum value ( but is not differentiable ) along two lines crossing at @xmath70 . in an infinite - dimensional analogue ,",
    "the `` lines '' of constant action can be a full - dimensional subspace of the configuration space .",
    ", width=377,height=264 ]    before giving , in the next section , a set of stochastic solutions of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , we would like to illustrate more generally the concept of zero - modes and coherent contributions to the path integral .",
    "in fact , the application of this concept to the massless harmonic oscillator is only one example , but there are other possible applications ( notably to general relativity @xcite ) .",
    "let us start with a simpler analogy , namely with a functional integral in statistical mechanics with a real boltzmann weight @xmath71 .",
    "if we know the density of states @xmath72 as a function of the energy , we can write the average value of any function @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath20 is a normalization factor .    if the density @xmath72 has a @xmath75-like peak for some value @xmath62 ( fig .  1 ) , then we expect that the configurations with energy @xmath62 give a relevant contribution to the averages .",
    "if , however , @xmath62 is large with respect to the ground state energy and the temperature @xmath76 is not very high , the contribution of the states with energy @xmath62 will be quite suppressed by the factor @xmath63 ; and in any case , all values of @xmath77 contribute to the averages , albeit with the weight @xmath71 .    in a feynman path integral with complex weight",
    "@xmath78 we can imagine to integrate over a density of states @xmath79 which is a function of the action of the states .",
    "the states can be thought of as classical trajectories .",
    "we can write the average of a function @xmath80 , similarly to ( [ if1 ] ) , as @xmath81 in this case , however , the interference factor @xmath78 leads to a mutual cancellation of all the contributions from the continuous spectrum , except for those near the minimum .",
    "the other surviving contributions are those from possible @xmath75-like peaks ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which can also interfere between themselves , depending on the phase differences between @xmath82 , @xmath83 ...",
    "in our current example we are considering a system whose density @xmath79 has a minimum _ and _ a peak at @xmath54 ( and can also have other peaks , not computed here ) . a graphical representation which illustrates the behavior of the action @xmath56 as a functional of the classical paths is given in fig .",
    "3 . it is impossible , however , to fully represent in a finite - dimensional image a functional over an infinite - dimensional space .",
    "the idea is that the zero - modes are elements of those subspaces where @xmath56 is zero but not a minimum , like the four lines in the horizontal plane of fig .  3 , where the function of two variables represented is not differentiable .",
    "the smooth minimum of @xmath56 is at the origin and is surrounded by a full - dimensional region where @xmath56 is very close to zero ; but in the infinite - dimensional analogy also the `` lines '' of the zero - modes are infinite - dimensional like the full space and do not have zero measure like lines in 2d .",
    "we would like to offer here an alternative characterization of the zero - modes , based on a correspondence between eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and the over - damped kramers stochastic equation , namely @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents a stochastic process , the parameter @xmath16 and the noise @xmath14 are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ lang2 ] ) above , and @xmath86 represents a mass ( which in the following does not tend to zero , but is fixed ) . with the identifications @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , we see that ( [ e2 ] ) corresponds to ( [ e1 ] ) , provided we also admit that @xmath90 over any interval under consideration .",
    "this latter hypothesis ( ensemble average equals time average ) is very natural for a white noise stochastic process with zero correlation time like @xmath14 .",
    "it follows that the ensemble of stochastic functions @xmath85 is distributed according to the solution @xmath91 of the following fokker - planck equation ( smoluchowski equation ) @xmath92 w \\label{e2 - 1}\\ ] ]    ) with the + sign . in this case",

    "there are non - limited solutions on any interval .",
    "we interpret this as due to the quantum runaway which causes the average @xmath68 to diverge.,width=377,height=264 ]    let us look for stationary solutions of this equation .",
    "we obtain the homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations @xmath93 according to the choice @xmath89 ( note that this choice depends in turn on choosing @xmath60 positive or negative , while the sign of @xmath14 is irrelevant ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that with the + sign eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) admits only limited solutions resembling gaussians @xmath94 $ ] , while with the  sign the solutions are not limited ( see fig.s 4 , 5 for some numerical examples ) .",
    "this confirms the existence of zero - modes of the action which are not limited in space .",
    "we started our analysis looking at the elementary properties of a massless oscillator , regarded as a classical , stochastic and quantum system .",
    "since the quantum dynamics is readily seen to be singular , we turned to consider the feynman path integral , in order to clarify from the mathematical point of view the origin of these divergences .",
    "we found that the functional averages of quantities which are limited as functions of the coordinate @xmath21 are finite , therefore the divergence signals a true quantum runaway from the classical trajectories which minimize the action .",
    "this points to a more general criterion : if we suppose to perform the functional integration over a `` density of states '' @xmath79 which depends on the action of the configurations , then for systems with a continuum spectrum the interference factor @xmath78 ensures that the only relevant contribution originates from the stationary points of @xmath56 ; if , however , there are @xmath75-like peaks in @xmath79 , then the system can in fact run away to non - classical configurations .",
    "we have computed explicitly some of these configurations for the massless oscillator by solving the equation @xmath54 , regarded either as a differential equation depending on a function with null integral , or as a stochastic equation containing a white noise . a possible application of this method to a system far more complex and physically relevant than the massless oscillator concerns the einstein gravitational action @xmath95 .",
    "since the scalar curvature @xmath96 is not positive - definite , it is possible to find field configurations which do not satisfy the einstein equations in vacuum and still have zero action after the integration , due to a compensation between disjoint regions with positive and negative curvature . configurations of this kind have been computed in @xcite .",
