    "the axion  @xcite is a nambu - goldstone boson associated with breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry which was invented as a solution to the strong cp problem in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale @xmath2 is stringently constrained by laboratory experiments , astrophysics and cosmology : allowed range of @xmath2 lies between @xmath6  gev and @xmath3  gev  @xcite .",
    "the axion is also cosmologically attractive since it can be a cold dark matter if @xmath2 takes the higher values @xmath7  gev .",
    "inflationary universe  @xcite was proposed to solve various problems in the standard cosmology ( e.g. flatness and horizon problems ) .",
    "there have been constructed many inflation models since then .",
    "the chaotic inflation model  @xcite seems the most attractive candidate among them that realizes naturally the inflationary universe .",
    "however , when we consider the axion in the chaotic inflationary universe , we are confronted with two serious cosmological problems , both of which are associated with large quantum fluctuations generated in the exponentially expanding phase ( i.e. , inflationary epoch ) of the early universe .",
    "one is the domain wall problem  @xcite . in the inflationary universe fluctuations of the axion field @xmath8",
    "are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble constant . since a phase @xmath11 of the peccei - quinn scalar field",
    "is related to the axion field @xmath8 by @xmath12 , the fluctuations of @xmath11 is given by @xmath13 in the chaotic inflation model , @xmath14  gev  @xcite is required to explain the anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cbr ) observed by cobe  @xcite .",
    "then , the fluctuations of the phase @xmath11 become @xmath15 for @xmath16  gev , which means that the phase is quite random during the inflation .",
    "therefore , when the universe cools down to about 1  gev and the axion potential is formed , the axion sits at different positions of the potential in different regions of the universe .",
    "since the axion potential has @xmath1 discrete minima ( @xmath1 : qcd anomaly factor ) , domain walls are produced  @xcite .",
    "the domain wall with @xmath0 is a disk - like object whose boundary is an axionic string and it collapses quickly due to its surface tension .",
    "thus the domain wall with @xmath0 is cosmologically harmless .",
    "however , the domain wall with @xmath17 is disastrous because it forms a complicated network with an axionic string and dominates the energy density of the universe quickly  @xcite .",
    "the second problem is that the quantum fluctuations for the axion field cause too large anisotropies of cbr  @xcite . since the axion does not have a potential during the inflation",
    ", the axion fluctuations @xmath18 do not contribute to the energy density of the universe . in this sense , the axion fluctuations are isocurvature .",
    "after the axion acquires a mass @xmath19 , its fluctuations become density fluctuations given by @xmath20 which causes the cbr temperature fluctuations @xmath21 . from eq.([delta - theta ] ) , we see that the produced cbr anisotropies are @xmath15 which contradicts the observation .    it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that these problems are simultaneously solved if the potential for the peccei - quinn scalar field is very flat . in this case",
    "it is natural that the peccei - quinn scalar field @xmath22 takes a very large value @xmath23 during the inflation . here",
    ", @xmath24 is the planck mass ( @xmath25  gev ) .",
    "the axion field @xmath8 is defined as @xmath26 in the true vacuum @xmath27 takes @xmath28 .",
    "but the @xmath27 takes most likely @xmath29 at the inflationary epoch . from eq.([delta - theta ] ) it is clear that the phase fluctuations @xmath30 are suppressed as @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the isocurvature fluctuations are suppressed by a factor @xmath32 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , cosmological effects of the axionic isocurvature density fluctuations have been investigated in details by calculating spectra for matter fluctuations and @xmath33 , and it has been found that the effects of the isocurvature fluctuations are consistent with observations in a large parameter region .    as for the domain wall problem",
    ", it is naively expected that the same mechanism that suppresses the isocurvature fluctuations does also suppress the production of domain walls : i.e. the large effective `` @xmath2''@xmath34 during the inflation almost fixes the phase of @xmath22 which reduces the domain - wall production rate to negligible amount .",
    "in fact , the @xmath22 begins to oscillate after the inflation with its phase being fixed .",
    "however , the homogeneous peccei - quinn field decays into axions as well as @xmath27 particles through parametric resonances .",
    "the emitted axions induce large fluctuations of the axion field ( i.e. the phase @xmath30 ) and produce a large number of domain walls .    in this letter we study the above cosmological axion problems ( isocurvature - fluctuation and domain - wall problems ) in chaotic inflationary universe .",
    "we show that the domain walls are still produced through the parametric resonance decay even if we take a very flat potential for the peccei - quinn scalar .",
    "the domain wall problem is only avoided for the model with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we also show that the flat potential for @xmath22 required to solve the isocurvature - fluctuation problem is naturally obtained in a supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the peccei - quinn model .",
    "namely , the presence of flat directions is a generic feature in susy theories and the masses of the fields corresponding to the flat directions only comes from soft susy breaking terms which are of order the weak scale .",
    "therefore the flat potential for @xmath22 is naturally realized in the framework of susy .",
    "let us first consider the case for a scalar potential given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 . in the inflationary epoch ,",
    "the @xmath27 slowly evolves as @xmath37 where we have assumed that the potential for the inflaton @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "isocurvature fluctuations for cosmologically relevant scales are generated when @xmath40 .",
    "therefore the cbr anisotropies from the axion isocurvature fluctuations is given by   @xmath41 using a cobe constraint @xmath42 , we get @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    ", one gets essentially the same conclusion as in the text . ]",
    "notice that the coupling constant @xmath45 for the inflaton is already very small as @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "next we consider domain wall production with the potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the peccei - quinn field @xmath22 starts to oscillate after the inflation .",
    "we only consider the evolution of @xmath22 in the `` radial '' direction @xmath47 with its phase being fixed since the quantum fluctuations of the axion phase @xmath48 are negligiblly small when @xmath49 as discussed in the introduction . as easily seen from eq.([potential ] ) the `` radial '' potential has two minima ( @xmath50 ) .   and",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath52 is the initial value of the axion phase . ]",
    "since the initial potential energy density of @xmath27 is large , the @xmath27 oscillates beyond the potential hill at @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath27 loses its energy through cosmic expansion and particle production and settles down to one of the potential minima eventually .    if the dynamics after inflation is purely classical , the final value of @xmath27 ( @xmath2 or @xmath54 ) depends on the initial value of @xmath27 .",
    "however , it has been recently pointed out that the oscillating coherent field quickly losses its energy through violent particle production due to parametric resonance  @xcite .",
    "the parametric resonance decay occurs during the @xmath27 oscillation . in the present model ,",
    "only a self - production ( e.g. @xmath55 ) is effective .",
    "can couple to other fields @xmath56 .",
    "although the mass of @xmath56 is large @xmath57 in the true vacuum of @xmath22 , the coherent @xmath22 field also decays into @xmath56 particles through the parametric resonance .",
    "however , this does not change the conclusion in this paper as will be noted in the end of this section . ]",
    "( notice that the `` radial '' oscillation induces excitations of the phase ( = axions ) as well as @xmath27 . ) in this case the classical picture does not apply at all .",
    "the important fact is that the quantum fluctuations due to the emitted @xmath27 and axion particles becomes quite large .",
    "contributions of the quantum fluctuations @xmath58 and @xmath59 to the energy density of @xmath22 are @xmath60  @xcite and @xmath61 ,   respectively .",
    "since most of the initial oscillation energy @xmath62 is transferred to @xmath22 particles through the parametric resonance , we expect that the fluctuations of @xmath27 and @xmath11 are given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , which leads to production of domain walls .    for more quantitative analysis",
    ", we need to solve equations for modes of the fluctuations @xmath65 and @xmath66 which correspond to @xmath27 particle and axion with momentum @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "however it is more convenient to use two field @xmath68 and @xmath69 which are defined by @xmath70 and @xmath71 with initial condition @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then the fluctuations of @xmath27 and @xmath11 are approximately given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the evolutions of @xmath68 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are described by @xmath78 \\delta x_k             & = & - 3 g \\langle ( \\delta x)^2 \\rangle \\delta x_k               -    g \\langle ( \\delta y)^2 \\rangle \\delta x_k ,      \\label{delta - x}\\\\      \\delta\\ddot{y}_k + [ k^2 - g f_a^2 + g x^2 ] \\delta y_k           & = & -    g \\langle ( \\delta x)^2 \\rangle \\delta y_k               - 3 g \\langle ( \\delta y)^2 \\rangle \\delta y_k ,      \\label { delta - y}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the mean field approximation ( @xmath79,@xmath80 ) and neglected the cosmological expansion . before we present results of the full numerical integration of the above equations , we briefly discuss instability of the equations for @xmath76 and @xmath81 . when the amplitude of the @xmath68 oscillation is much larger than @xmath2 , a solution to eq.([eq - x ] ) is approximately given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the amplitude of the oscillation . using this solution and neglecting back reactions , eqs.([delta - x ] ) and ( [ delta - y ] )",

    "\\delta y_k '' + [ a_y(k ) - 2q_y \\cos ( 2z)]\\delta y_k & \\simeq & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath91 . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the mathieu equation has instability for @xmath67 which satisfies @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath94 the strongest instability ( resonance ) for @xmath95 occurs in the second instability band , i.e. @xmath96 . on the other hand the resonance for @xmath97 occurs in the first instability band and the instability is stronger than that for @xmath95 . since @xmath97 roughly corresponds to the axion with momentum @xmath67 it",
    "is expected that the homogeneous @xmath68 field decays dominantly into axions .",
    "however , as the fluctuations increase , back reactions , i.e. , terms in rhs of eqs.([delta - x ] ) and ( [ delta - y ] ) , become significant and the instability is weakened . to see the evolution of the fluctuations with back reactions , we need numerical calculations as shown below .",
    "precise time evolution of the fluctuations is obtained by full numerical integration of eqs.([eq - x ] )  ( [ delta - y ] ) and results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol - x ]  [ fig : evol - dth ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol - dx ] and [ fig : evol - dy ] , the fluctuations of both @xmath68 and @xmath69 increase through the parametric resonances . since the instability of @xmath77 is stronger , the fluctuations of @xmath69 increase faster than those of @xmath68 . as the fluctuations increase ,",
    "the back reactions become important and weaken the instability and finally the fluctuations become almost constant . as is expected , the final fluctuations are large and , in particular , the phase fluctuations are of order 1 ( @xmath64 ) , which results in the production of too many domain walls ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : evol - dth ] ) .    the above mechanism for producing domain walls seems quite general . in fact",
    "we have solved equations for the fluctuations with a potential @xmath98 and obtain almost the same result .",
    "we also consider interaction between @xmath22 and other scalar fields @xmath56 : @xmath99 .",
    "decay is @xmath100 .",
    "this interaction , however , gives unbounded potential at the vacuum @xmath101 and hence we discard this possibility .",
    "] if the coupling @xmath102 is larger than @xmath103 , the @xmath22 field first decays into @xmath56-particles .",
    "however , the back reactions of @xmath56-particles suppress the resonance decay when @xmath104  @xcite",
    ". then the remaining @xmath22 field may decay into @xmath27-particles and axions through the parametric resonance , which results in large phase fluctuations ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "thus the production of @xmath56 particles can not suppress the violent fluctuations of the axion phase .",
    "therefore , the production of domain walls may not be avoided in the chaotic inflationary universe .",
    "since the produced domain walls dominate the density of the universe for the axion model with @xmath17 , only the model with @xmath0 is allowed .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath0 model is easily constructed in a hadronic axion model for example  @xcite .",
    "we now consider a susy extension of a hadronic axion model .",
    "we take the following simple superpotential : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are chiral superfields with peccei - quinn charges @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , and the coupling constant @xmath111 is assumed to be @xmath105 . and antiquark @xmath112 whose peccei - quinn charges are @xmath113 .",
    "this charges are chosen so that @xmath114 and @xmath112 have a yukawa coupling @xmath115 .",
    "this model has the qcd anomaly factor @xmath0 . ]",
    "then the scalar potential is written as @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are scalar components of superfields @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . here",
    "we should note that there are flat directions that satisfy @xmath119 we also add soft susy breaking terms to the potential .",
    "then , the scalar potential @xmath120 that we should study is @xmath121 where @xmath122 are soft masses of @xmath123 .",
    "we discuss cosmological evolution of these scalar fields .",
    "the chaotic situation at the planck time may lead to large initial values of order @xmath24 for @xmath117 and @xmath124 .",
    "the soft masses can be negligible at the inflation epoch since they are much smaller than the expansion rate of the universe ( @xmath125  gev ) .",
    "however , there exist a class of supergravity models where such scalar masses are negligible compared with @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "we assume such a class of models in this paper . ]",
    "therefore these fields roll down into the flat direction given by eq.([constraint ] ) .",
    "however , one scalar field , either @xmath126 or @xmath127 , may stay at the initial position , i.e. , @xmath128 or @xmath129 .",
    "we assume that it is the case and take , for definiteness , @xmath130 and eliminate @xmath127 and @xmath124 using eq.([constraint ] ) .",
    "then , the effective lagrangian for @xmath126 is written as @xmath131 since the potential ( [ plus - pot ] ) is very steep at @xmath132 and the kinetic term is always positive , the energy conservation never allows the @xmath126 to pass through the origin @xmath133 .",
    "thus , this potential has effectively only one minimum .",
    "from the above lagrangian we obtain equations of motion for the homogeneous field @xmath126 and phase fluctuations @xmath134 : @xmath135 where the prime denotes @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in eq.([radial - evolv ] ) the back reactions of @xmath139 are assumed to be neglected .",
    "although eq.([mode - evolv ] ) looks different from the mathieu equation , numerical calculations show that it has indeed strong instability ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : para ] ) .",
    "therefore we expect that the parametric resonance induces large phase fluctuations and results in the production of domain walls .",
    "however these domain walls are cosmologically harmless since we consider the hadronic axion model with @xmath0 as discussed in the previous section .",
    "let us now estimate isocurvature fluctuations of the axion in the susy model .",
    "first we rewrite @xmath126 and @xmath127 as @xmath140 we also define the fields @xmath141 and @xmath142 by @xmath143 from eq.([susy - pot ] ) , the potential @xmath144 for @xmath142 is given by @xmath145 thus the mass of @xmath142 is @xmath146 , which is much larger than the hubble constant during the inflation and hence @xmath142 quickly becomes zero at the inflation epoch . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential for @xmath141 is flat and is regarded as the axion . at the inflation epoch ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations of @xmath141 are given by , assuming @xmath147 , @xmath148 since the mass of @xmath142 is very large compared with @xmath10 , the quantum fluctuations of @xmath142 are negligible and hence @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations for phases ( @xmath150 ) of @xmath151 are given by @xmath152 since @xmath153 and @xmath154  gev , fluctuations of the phase @xmath150 are quite small ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "after the axion obtains a mass , the phase fluctuations result in isocurvature density fluctuations and produce the cbr anisotropies as explained in the non - susy case .",
    "when @xmath126 and @xmath127 settle down to the true minimum of the potential ( i.e. , @xmath156 ) , the axion field is written as @xmath157 and its fluctuation @xmath158 is given by @xmath159 , which gives @xmath160 .",
    "thus the @xmath161 is predicted as @xmath162 , which is consistent with the cobe observation .",
    "in particular , if @xmath163  gev , the predicted cbr anisotropies due to the isocurvature density fluctuations are large enough to be detected by future observations as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in susy peccei - quinn models",
    ", there exists an axino which is a supersymmetric partner of the axion .",
    "the mass of the axino is presumed to be the susy scale , i.e. @xmath164  gev ",
    "@xmath165  tev .",
    "the axino of such a large mass is cosmologically harmless since it decays into lighter particles quickly .",
    "in summary , we have investigated two cosmological axion problems ( isocurvature fluctuations and domain - wall formation ) in chaotic inflationary universe .",
    "the isocurvature - fluctuation problem is solved if potential for the peccei - quinn scalar field is very flat .",
    "however , we have found that too many domain walls are produced through the parametric resonance decay of the peccei - quinn scalar field and only the model with @xmath0 is allowed .",
    "we have also pointed out that the flat potential which is necessary to solve the isocurvature - fluctuation problem is naturally obtained in a susy extension of the peccei - quinn model .",
    "namely , we do not need any small coupling constant in the susy model for obtaining such a flat potential . on the other hand a very small coupling constant ( @xmath43 )",
    "is necessary in non susy peccei - quinn models .",
