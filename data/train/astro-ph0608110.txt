    "_ 2005 ) along with other data on galaxy luminosity functions and redshift evolution in order to make a detailed evaluation of the intergalactic photon density as a function of both energy and redshift for @xmath8 for photon energies from .003 ev to the lyman limit cutoff at 13.6 ev in a @xmath9cdm universe with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "they then used their calculated intergalactic photon densities to calculate the optical depth of the universe , @xmath12 , for @xmath0-rayshaving energies from 4 gev to 100 tev emitted by sources at redshifts from  0 to 5 .",
    "they also gave a parametric fit with numerical coefficients for @xmath13 .",
    "as an example of the application of the detailed numerical determination of the optical depth , they calculated the absorbed spectrum of the blazar pks 2155 - 304 at @xmath14 and compared it with the spectrum observed by the h.e.s.s . air cherenkov @xmath0-ray   telescope array .",
    "it was noted that a steepening in an @xmath15 power - law differential photon source spectrum for pks 2155 - 304 would be steepened by approximately one power to @xmath16 as would be produced by a @xmath0-ray   opacity with a logarithmic energy dependence .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to generalize this result by determining fits for approximating @xmath17 by logarithmic functions in order to predict power - law steepenings in assumed blazar source spectra of the form @xmath18 to observed spectra of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is determined to be a linear function of @xmath7 .",
    "in order to derive our results , we fit the results from sms for @xmath17 to a form which is assumed to be logarithmic in @xmath22 in the energy range @xmath23 and which has a linear dependence on @xmath7 over the range @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to note that our linear fit to the @xmath7 dependence is both _",
    "qualitatively _ and _ quantitatively _ different from the linear dependence on redshift which would be obtained for small redshifts @xmath25 and which simply comes from the fact that for small @xmath7 where luminosity evolution is unimportant and where @xmath26 , with the distance @xmath27 , our quantitaitve fit for the higher redshift range @xmath24 comes from the more complex calculations based on the models of sms . for this reason ,",
    "our linear fits are not simply proportional to redshift .",

    "will then be given by    @xmath33    where the intrinsic spectral index of the source is steepened by @xmath34 .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 , and @xmath36 obtained by fitting the optical depths derived for the fast evolution ( fe ) and baseline ( b ) models of sms are given in table 1 .",

    "table 2 gives a list of blazars which have been detected at tev energies and for which spectral indices ( @xmath32 ) have been measured in the energy range 0.2  2 tev .",
    "we also give the observed redshifts of these sources and the intrinsic spectral indices of the sources ( @xmath4 ) derived from the baseline ( b)and fast evolution ( fe ) models using our analytic expressions for @xmath38 . a spectral index of less than 2 indicates that the energy range of the observation would be below the compton peak energy in the spectral energy distribution , @xmath39 of a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model ( stecker , de jager & salamon 1996 ) . in the case of the blazar pg 1553 + 113 , the energy range of the observation is from 0.09 to 0.4 tev which is somewhat below the energy range we have used in deriving our approximation .",

    "the actual spectra should exhibit some curvature . at higher energies the spectra should cut off either because of a natural upper limit to the source spectra or , more likely in the case of high frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , because of the increase in optical depth with energy owing to interactions with the much more numerous intergalactic far infrared photons .",
