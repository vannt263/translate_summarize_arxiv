    "the importance of the triple-@xmath7 process is well known in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the process leads from three free @xmath7-particles via a low - lying resonance into the ground state of @xmath0c .",
    "the inverse of the crucial part of this process is the decay of a resonance of @xmath0c into the continuum of three @xmath7-particles , perhaps via intermediate states of @xmath5be @xcite .",
    "the principle of detailed balance relates direct and inverse processes .",
    "similar processes involving three charged particles occur at specific waiting points for the @xmath8-process @xcite .    moreover , the breakup of a physical system into a three - body continuum with coulomb interaction is not yet a well understood problem of few body physics , although it has been studied over many years . in the three - body final state",
    "the asymptotics are determined by the dynamics of the breakup process itself .",
    "the study of these processes would help us to find out about the inverse process ( triple-@xmath7 and 2p capture ) and to study to what extent the three particles of the final state may be present as a cluster structure in the many - body initial state",
    ". the main difficulty lies in constructing correct asymptotic wave functions when both two- and three - body structures are present .",
    "several published experimental results strongly suggest that the decay mechanism varies from sequential decay , via an intermediate quasi - stable state , to direct decay into the three - body continuum @xcite .",
    "the corresponding energy distributions exhibit completely different shapes .",
    "reliable model computations reproducing the measured energy distributions are not available",
    ". this may be understandable due to several indispensable difficult requirements , but it is nevertheless very unfortunate because quantitatively accurate models are needed to extract and understand the underlying physics contained in the increasing amount of experimental high - quality data sets .    in the present paper",
    "we exploit a reliable recently developed technique to compute the large distance properties of a many body resonance that decays into three particles .",
    "we shall use the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method of the faddeev equations combined with complex scaling of the coordinates @xcite .",
    "the method first provides an accurate computation of the resonance properties , which determines the energy distribution between the three particles after the decay .",
    "we describe @xmath0c as a three-@xmath7 cluster system , since triple-@xmath7 decay is the only open non - electromagnetic decay channel for this nucleus .",
    "we use the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method combined with complex scaling to compute the resonance wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "the so - called hyperradius @xmath9 is the most important of the coordinates , and is defined as @xmath10 for three identical particles of mass @xmath11 , where we choose @xmath12 to be equal to the nucleon mass , @xmath13 is the coordinate of the i - th particle and @xmath14 is the centre - of - mass coordinate .",
    "we first choose the two - body interaction to reproduce the low - energy two - body scattering properties @xcite . to adjust the energy position of the many - body resonance",
    "we add then a three - body potential , whose range corresponds to three touching @xmath7-particles .",
    "these potentials are chosen independently for each @xmath15 .",
    "the total wave function is expanded on the angular eigenfunctions @xmath16 obtained as solutions to the faddeev equations for fixed @xmath9 , @xmath17 where the radial coefficients @xmath18 are obtained from the coupled set of radial equations .",
    "the effective adiabatic potentials are the eigenvalues of the angular part .",
    "the three - body potential is used to adjust the small - distance part of the effective potential in order to reproduce the correct resonance energies ; at intermediate distances the potential has a barrier that determines the resonance width ; and at large distances the resonance wave functions contain information about distributions of relative energies .",
    "the large - distance asymptotic behaviour of the decaying resonance wave function determines the observable energy distribution .",
    "this energy distribution can be computed in coordinate space , except for a phase - space factor , as the integral of the absolute square of the total wave function for a large value of the hyperradius @xcite .",
    "we shall explore the conjecture that the final state can be described entirely within the present cluster model .",
    "the method allows investigations of a number of the low - lying @xmath0c resonances , i.e. , two @xmath19 , three @xmath20 , two @xmath21 , and one of each of @xmath22 , @xmath2 , @xmath23 , @xmath6 and @xmath24 @xcite , all below 13.5 mev .",
    "the resonance structures are changing substantially from small to large distances .",
    "the crucial observables to study the dynamics of the breakup process are the momentum distributions of the particles after the decay .",
    "we use the @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 resonances of @xmath0c as examples in this report . in our computation",
    "we get only one @xmath2 and one @xmath6 state .",
    "we suggest the latter should correspond to the state at 6.08 mev above the triple-@xmath7 threshold for which a preliminary spin - parity of @xmath2 is assigned in @xcite .",
    "the computed energy distributions could also be used as a tool to decide this assignment by comparing with measurement .",
    "the energies and widths are compatible with the experimental values .",
    "for @xmath4 we get ( @xmath25,@xmath26)=(3.61,0.475 ) mev , compared to the experiment ( 3.57,0.315 ) mev ; for @xmath2 we get ( 4.53,0.452 ) mev , being the experimental values ( 4.55,0.260 ) mev ; and for the uncertain @xmath27 the theoretical values are ( 5.98,1.035 ) mev and the experimental ones ( 6.08,0.375 ) mev .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown the results corresponding to the @xmath19 and @xmath28 states of @xmath0c . in both cases",
    "accurate measurements of @xmath7-particle energy distributions are available @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 resonances are often approximated by @xmath7-cluster states preferentially decaying sequentially .",
    "in contrast the @xmath28 resonance has no significant cluster structure and is referred to as a shell - model state .",
    "its decay has been suggested to be direct .",
    "still for both cases the decays into three @xmath7-particles are determined at intermediate and large distances .",
    "the agreement with the accurately measured distributions is remarkably good .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath28 resonance is best described by direct decay into the three - body continuum , whereas the @xmath19 resonances decay sequentially via @xmath5be ground state .",
    "we show in fig.[2minus1minus ] the ratios of the four lowest adiabatic radial wavefunctions as a function of the hyperradius for the @xmath2 and @xmath4 resonances located at 4.5 mev and 3.6 mev above the triple-@xmath7 threshold , respectively .",
    "one can note from the figure that only the component relative to the first adiabatic potential contributes significantly .",
    "this reflects the fact that only few eigenvalues are needed to get an accurate solution , due to the fast convergence of the adiabatic expansion .",
    "the relative sizes of the radial wavefunctions change dramatically around 25 fm and 15 fm for the @xmath2 and @xmath4 states , respectively .",
    "the corresponding change of structure around 30 fm is related to an attempt of populating the 2-body state @xmath5be(@xmath20 ) .",
    "the ratios of the radial wavefunctions are also shown to be quite stable under variations of the hyperradius at large distances , that is where the energy distributions are determined .    in fig.[2minus4minus ]",
    "we plot the @xmath7-particle energy distribution of the @xmath2 and @xmath6 resonances of @xmath0c for different relatively large @xmath9-values .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour is already reached for hyperradii around 70 fm .",
    "it can be seen in fig.[2minus4minus ] that there is a small variation of the @xmath6 distribution from 80 to 100 fm . in the @xmath2 distribution",
    "the curves corresponding to 80 and 100 fm are in fact indistinguishable . as a test",
    "we have fourier transformed the wavefunction by use of the analytic solution to the numerically computed adiabatic potentials , which at large distances is approximated by sums of @xmath29 and @xmath30 terms .",
    "we obtain very similar distributions with both procedures .",
    "since both @xmath2 and @xmath6 are non - natural parity states , their decay can not occur sequentially via @xmath31be ground state .",
    "we are dealing then with a direct decay into the three - body continuum , or perhaps alternatively with sequential decay via @xmath5be(@xmath20 ) .",
    "if we estimate the sequential decay via the @xmath5be(@xmath20 ) it would produce a peak around @xmath32 in the @xmath2 and around @xmath33 in the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "these peaks do not correspond to the ones shown in fig.[2minus4minus ] , which means that the 2@xmath34 and 4@xmath34 energy distributions in the figure are not consistent with a sequential decay .",
    "the structure in fig.[2minus4minus ] can be understood by separating into individual partial wave contributions .",
    "the two peaks for the @xmath2 state are then related to the two dominating terms of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the angular momentum between two particles ( @xmath37 ) , and their centre of mass and the third particle ( @xmath38 ) . for the @xmath6-state both ( @xmath37,@xmath38)=(2,3 ) and ( 4,1 )",
    "contribute each with rather asymmetric distributions .",
    "thus we describe these decays as direct into the three - body continuum .",
    "the energy distribution for the @xmath4 resonance is shown in fig.[1minus ] .",
    "the narrow high - energy peak and the distribution around one quarter of the maximum energy reflect the characteristic features of a sequential decay via a quasi - stable state . since the two - body asymptotic behaviour has not been reached for a hyperradius smaller than 100 fm , the computed distributions are not accurate , but they provide us with information about the sequential decay .",
    "we use the fact that the sequential decay assymptotically must be contained in one of the adiabatic potentials , in the present case in the first one .",
    "we can substitute then the inaccurate component by the fourier transform of the known asymptotic two - body behaviour .",
    "this sequential part of the energy distribution is approximated by the leading order breit - wigner shape for the first emitted @xmath7-particle .",
    "it has a high - energy peak at the most probable position ( 2/3 of the resonance energy ) .",
    "the width is the sum of the three - body decaying resonance width and the width of the intermediate two - body resonance . by kinematic conditions we can compute the energy of the two @xmath7-particles emerging from @xmath31be , that gives rise to the peak at lower energy . after removing the contribution from the first adiabatic potential ,",
    "the remaining energy distribution is described as direct decay by the computed three - body continuum coordinate space wavefunction . from the results in fig.[1minus ]",
    "we find that the direct decay is about 24% of the total distribution .",
    "the distribution is rather uniform but mostly visible between the separate peaks of the sequential decay .",
    "we have applied a general new method to compute the particle - energy distributions of some of the three - body decaying @xmath0c many - body resonances .",
    "we conjectured that the energy distributions of the decay fragments are insensitive to the initial many - body structure .",
    "the energy distributions are then determined by the energy and three - body resonance structure as obtained in a three-@xmath7 cluster model .",
    "these momentum distributions are determined by the coordinate space wavefunctions at large distances .",
    "we have shown the examples of @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 states of @xmath0c .",
    "the preliminary spin - parity assignment of the @xmath2 state at 6.08 mev above the triple-@xmath7 threshold is suggested to be changed to @xmath6 .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath6 resonances are best described by direct decay into the three - body continuum , whereas the @xmath4 resonance have substantial cluster components and decays preferentially via @xmath5be ground state .",
    "the partial wave structure of the resonance at large distances is crucial for the energy distribution .",
    "in conclusion , we predict energy distributions of particles emitted in three - body decays .",
    "both sequential and direct , and both short and long range interactions are treated .",
