    "the casimir effect is one of the macroscopic manifestations of the fluctuations of the quantum vacuum  @xcite .",
    "casimir showed that the energy @xmath0 , between two parallel perfect conductor plates can be found from the change of the zero - point energy of the classical electromagnetic field , as @xmath1 , \\label{uint}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are the proper modes that satisfy the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic field at the plates which are separated a distance @xmath3 .",
    "the energy obtained by casimir is a power law function of @xmath3 , and at large distances @xmath4 , while at short distances @xmath5 .",
    "later , lifshitz obtained a formula to calculate the force between two parallel half - spaces with arbitrary dielectric properties  @xcite .",
    "the lifshitz formula depends only on the reflection amplitude coefficients of the half - spaces and the separation between them , finding the same dependence of the energy with @xmath3 . in 1968 , van kampen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the lifshitz formula , in the non - retarded limit , is obtained from the zero - point energy resulting from the coulomb interaction of the surface plasmons of the plates .",
    "after , gerlach  @xcite did an extension showing that also in the retarded limit , the lifshitz formula is obtained from the interacting surface plasmons .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the casimir energy is given by the contribution from the interacting surface plasmons and propagating modes in the cavity formed by the parallel plates  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the contribution from the surface plasmons is essential to calculate the casimir energy  @xcite .",
    "surface plasmons are evanescent electromagnetic waves that propagate along the surface of conductors , and vanish elsewhere . by altering the surface , i.e. ,",
    "modifying size , shape , and/or environment of the conductor , the properties of surface plasmons can be tailored  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the shape of at least one of the bodies is modified , we would expect to observe changes on the energy due to the interaction between surface plasmons . in this paper",
    ", we study the influence of the geometry on the zero - point energy due to the interaction between macroscopic bodies . using a method based on a spectral representation formalism @xcite , which determines the proper frequencies of the system",
    ", we calculate the zero - point energy of all the interacting surface plasmons between a spheroidal particle and a flat plate , both with arbitrary dielectric functions .",
    "we find that the geometry plays an important role in the determination of the energy .",
    "we consider a spheroidal particle located near a flat substrate .",
    "the particle is generated by the rotation around one of the axes of an ellipse with lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the symmetry axis of the particle is perpendicular to the substrate , and its center is located at a distance @xmath9 from the substrate which has a dielectric constant @xmath10 .",
    "the particle has a dielectric function @xmath11 and is embedded in an ambient of dielectric constant @xmath12 , which is equal to 1 for vacuum .",
    "we consider that the three media : particle , substrate and ambient are non - magnetic .",
    "we are not considering nonlocal effects , therefore , all the variables are function of the frequency only .",
    "the explicit dependence of the following equations with the frequency is omitted here for simplicity .",
    "the charge distribution on the particle s surface , in the presence of a substrate , depends with the components of the external electromagnetic excitations , throughout the so called effective polarizability tensor @xmath13 . when the particle is far from the substrate the effective polarizability becomes the polarizability of the isolated particle .",
    "but , when the particle is close to the substrate the induced multipolar interactions modify the electromagnetic response of the system because more surface plasmon resonances of the particle interact with those in the substrate  @xcite .",
    "the quantum vacuum fluctuations induce a charge distribution on the particle which also induces a charge distribution in the substrate . in the non - retarded limit , the induced @xmath14-th multipolar moment on the particle",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath15 , \\label{qlm}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the field associated to the quantum vacuum fluctuations at the zero - point energy , @xmath17 is the induced field due to the presence of the half - space , and @xmath18 is the @xmath14-th component of the effective polarizability of the particle .",
    "it is known that the poles of @xmath13 yield the frequencies of the proper modes of the system  @xcite . in the non - retarded limit ,",
    "the spheroidal radius of the major axis , and the minimun separation between the particle and the substrate are much smaller than the characteristic length of the system given , in this case , by @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the speed of light , and @xmath21 the plasma frequency of the metallic particle .",
    "the analysis of @xmath13 for the system described above was done as follows .",
    "first , the electric potential induced in the system at any point in space was calculated to all multipolar orders . to find the solution for the induced potential a spectral representation of the fuchs - bergman - milton type  @xcite",
    "was developed  @xcite . by identifying the multipolar moments",
    "@xmath22 induced in the particle , the components of @xmath13 were obtained .",
    "then , the frequencies of the proper modes for different shapes and locations of the particles is calculated by choosing a model for the dielectric function of the particle . for a detailed description of the method see ref .",
    "@xcite .    within the spectral representation formalism ,",
    "we can write the component of @xmath13 in the following form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the volume of the particle , @xmath3 is the minimum separation distance from the particle to the substrate ; such that , @xmath25 for prolate spheroids while @xmath26 for oblate spheroids . here",

    "in the next section we present results for the energy between a spheroid and a plate due to the interaction of all the induced multipolar surface plasmons .",
    "as follows , we present a systematic study of the energy for oblate and prolate particles with different asymmetries and considering different kinds of substrates .",
    "the energy is calculated by substituting the frequencies of the proper modes , obtained as described above , in eq .",
    "( [ uint ] ) . using the spectral representation ,",
    "a systematic study of the energy in term of the geometrical parameters : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath3 , and the dielectric properties of the substrate , can be done .    in the presence of a dielectric half - space ,",
    "the proper modes , given by @xmath38 , are red - shifted always as the particle approaches the substrate , and this shift depends on the separation distance @xmath3 . in general , the interaction energy is negative for any @xmath3 , and is proportional to @xmath43 , with @xmath44 . here",

    "let us first analyze the influence of the dielectric properties of the substrate on the energy as a function of the dimensionless distance @xmath62 . in fig .",

    "the case of @xmath68 is just for illustration .",
    "the interaction strength between the particle and the substrate is modulate by the contrast factor given by eq .",
    "[ fc ] , which is a function of @xmath10 . for distances ,",
    "@xmath69 , the energy goes to @xmath70 faster , as smaller is the value of @xmath10 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . at small distances , @xmath71 ,",
    "the interaction between the particle and substrate increases considerably , because the largest value of the multipolar interaction @xmath45 becomes larger , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . however , the value of @xmath72 is independent of @xmath10 , and the observed differences at a given distance are due to the fact that the strength of the multipolar surface plasmon interactions are modulated with the factor @xmath73 , such that , for larger values of the substrate dielectric constant the force strength increases . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we observe that the energy at a given distance is larger for greater values of @xmath10 . the same general behavior of the energy as a function of the dielectric function of the substrate is also found for prolate spheroids .",
    "now let us examine in detail the influence of the geometrical parameters on the energy between different spheroidal particles and a sapphire substrate , as a function of the dimensionless distance @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the dimensionless energy for oblate spheroids with different aspect ratios between the semi - axes , @xmath75 , is shown . at a fix distance ,",
    "the energy for oblate spheroids is larger when the aspect ratio @xmath76 , i.e. , when the spheroids tend to the spherical shape .",
    "since the substrate is always the same , this means that the value of @xmath72 becomes larger when @xmath77 at any distance . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the same is shown for prolate spheroids , however , we observe two different regimes in this case . when @xmath78 , the value of @xmath72 becomes larger when @xmath77 , but the contrary occurs when @xmath79 .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath72 not only depends on the separation distance , but also on the axes aspect ratio @xmath80 , and the specific symmetry of the particle . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we also observe that the energy behavior is different for oblate and prolate spheroids , which is more evident when @xmath71 .",
    "the energy for oblate particles becomes more negative faster than for prolate ones , because the value of @xmath72 is larger for oblates . in conclusion ,",
    "the exponent @xmath81 of the power - law behavior of the energy depends on the specific geometrical parameters @xmath3 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    to examine in detail the energy dependence with the geometry of the system , let consider different spheroidal particles at a fix distance @xmath3 and all with the axis normal the surface @xmath82 , such that , @xmath83 is a constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) is shown the dimensionless energy as a function of the aspect ration @xmath84 between the axis parallel to the surface ( @xmath85 ) and the one normal to it .",

    "[ fig3](a ) . here",
    ", one can observe clearly the energy reliance on the geometry .",
    "for prolate spheroids the relevant multipolar interactions do not change dramatically with the aspect ratio of the axes .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath72 increases smoothly as the aspect ratio goes to @xmath89 . on the other hand , for oblate particles",
    "the number of multipolar interactions is more sensitive to @xmath90 , and the values of the largest multipolar interaction rises dramatically with small increments of @xmath90 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , the energy of prolate particles , at a fix @xmath3 and @xmath42 constant , with @xmath91 , as a function of @xmath80 is shown . in this case , the projected area of the particle over the substrate is always the same , since the minor axis is constant for all cases ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) . here , we observe that when the major axis increases the energy decreases because the reduction of number of relevant multipolar interactions involved , yielding different exponent of the power law function of @xmath3 for the energy .",
    "therefore , we have shown that the energy is very sensitive to the geometry of the system .",
    "the above results might provide an insight into the range of validity of the proximity theorem approximation , which was developed by derjaguin and abrikosova  @xcite to estimate the force between two curved surfaces of radii @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the proximity theorem approximation assumes that the force on a small area of one curved surface is due to locally `` flat '' portions on the other curved surface . within the proximity theorem approximation and when @xmath94 ,",
    "the force per unit area between two curved surfaces is : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the casimir energy per unit area between parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath3 . in the limit , when @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the problem reduces to a curved surface of radius @xmath99 and a flat plate , yielding @xmath100 the force obtained is a power law function of @xmath3 , and at `` large '' distances @xmath101 , while at short distances @xmath102 .",
    "the force is proportional to the radius of the curved surface , and to the inverse of its projected area on the flat plate .",
    "therefore , particles at a given distance with the same radii of curvature would feel a force with the same power law function of @xmath3 .",
    "curved surfaces with the same projected area at a given distance would feel also a force with the same power law function of @xmath3    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the dimensionless energy as a function of the aspect ratio @xmath103 , for ( a ) oblate and ( b ) prolate particles .",
    "we consider the case when all oblate ( prolate ) particles have the same curvature and are at a distance @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the energy for oblate , as well as , for prolate particles is a power law function of @xmath3 , which depends on the geometrical parameters , even when the curvature of the particle is not changed . in the case of prolate particles ,",
    "the value @xmath72 increases smoothly as the aspect ratio also does . on the other hand , for oblate particles",
