    "<S> this work is devoted to the derivation of novel analytic expressions and bounds for a family of special functions that are useful in wireless communication theory . </S>",
    "<S> these functions are the well - known nuttall @xmath0function , the incomplete toronto function , the rice @xmath1-function and the incomplete lipschitz - hankel integrals . capitalizing on the offered results </S>",
    "<S> , useful identities are additionally derived between the above functions and the humbert , @xmath2 , function as well as for specific cases of the kamp@xmath3 de f@xmath3riet function . </S>",
    "<S> these functions can be considered useful mathematical tools that can be employed in applications relating to the analytic performance evaluation of modern wireless communication systems such as cognitive radio , cooperative and free - space optical communications as well as radar , diversity and multi - antenna systems . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , new closed - form expressions are derived for the outage probability over non - linear generalized fading channels , namely , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as for specific cases of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 fading channels . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , simple expressions are presented for the channel capacity for the truncated channel inversion with fixed rate and the corresponding optimum cut - off signal - to - noise ratio for single - and multi - antenna communication systems over rician fading channels . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy and validity of the derived expressions is justified through extensive comparisons with respective numerical results .    </S>",
