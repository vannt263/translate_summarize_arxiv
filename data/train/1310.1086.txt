    "the formation of large - scale cosmological structure is acutely sensitive to the nature of gravitational collapse .",
    "it has been argued that an accurate measure of the growth rate , @xmath1 , defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the amplitude of the growing mode of matter density perturbations , can be used to constrain deviations from general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the method of choice for measuring @xmath1 ( or equivalently , @xmath4 ) is through redshift space distortions @xcite .",
    "the two - point correlation function of galaxies in redshift space is both anisotropic and scale - dependent , due to two competing effects : on small scales , the virialized motions of galaxies dominate over the hubble flow , resulting in the elongation of the contours of the correlation function along the line of sight  the _ fingers of god _ effect . on larger scales ,",
    "gravitational infall leads to a squashing of the contours that is detectable on scales of .",
    "there has been substantial progress in modelling this effect , both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite , and a number of systematic effects ( non - linearity , the role of bias ) have been studied .",
    "we will not discuss these difficulties here ( see @xcite for further details ) ; the focus of this paper is what we can learn from a measurement of @xmath4 once it has been extracted from the data .",
    "the current observational status of @xmath4 is promising and intriguing .",
    "the surveys of @xcite have measured the growth rate from @xmath5 to @xmath6 on a range of scales , with errors of approximately 10 - 20% .",
    "these measurements have provided decisive evidence for ruling out some extreme theories of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "we will show in this paper that other theories give rise to more subtle signatures that still lie within current experimental error bars ; however , this situation should change with the next generation of galaxy surveys ( see [ section : forecasts ] ) .",
    "the growth rate is a particularly attractive observable from a theoretical point of view . for a start",
    ", we expect to measure it predominantly on scales where linear cosmological perturbation theory is valid .",
    "there is a battery of well - seasoned techniques associated with linear perturbation theory , and it is possible to adapt these for use with nearly all modified gravity theories @xcite . extending growth rate calculations to the mildly non - linear regime is possible @xcite but still in its infancy ; furthermore , the reliance on theory - specific n - body simulations prevents one from making general statements about the effects of modified gravity on these scales .",
    "a key advantage of @xmath4 is that the range of scales probed is well inside the cosmological horizon , where the _ quasistatic _ approximation can be applied ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this means that the dependence on extra degrees of freedom ( an almost - inevitable feature of modified gravity ) can be simplified and much of the time - dependence of the gravitational field can be discarded . as a result ,",
    "the equations of motion for density perturbations and the growth rate are easy to work with .    in this paper",
    "we wish to explore the power of the growth rate as a probe of gravity .",
    "to do so , we first briefly introduce the quasistatic approximation in ",
    "[ section : quasistatic ] , and then use it in [ section : growth_rate ] to derive a generalized evolution equation for @xmath4 .",
    "we show how , in the quasistatic regime , it depends on : a ) modified gravitational clustering properties , and b ) modifications to the background expansion history . in [ section : linear_response ] we propose a simple and efficient method for linking the observable quantity @xmath7 to functions parameterizing deviations from gr . in [ section : forecasts ] we discuss the trade - off between the degree of agnosticism about gravity a parameterization implements and the resulting constraints on it from growth rate data . a particularly convenient way of mapping specific gravity models onto the formalism of this paper is to use the parameterized post - friedmann formalism @xcite ; we demonstrate this in [ section : ppf ] by calculating a suite of examples .",

    "this paper focuses on gravitational collapse in the _ quasistatic regime_. this is defined as the range of length - scales which are sufficiently large enough for linear perturbation theory to be accurate , but still significantly less that the cosmological horizon length .",
    "this permits two approximations to be made :    1 .",
    "the consideration of significantly subhorizon scales implies that , when working in fourier space , terms containing factors of @xmath8 can be safely neglected .",
    "2 .   on these spatial length - scales ,",
    "the time derivatives of scalar perturbations are negligible relative to their spatial derivatives . here ` scalar perturbations ' means both the usual gravitational potentials and any new perturbations not present in gr ( eg .",
    "@xmath9 for theories involving a new scalar field @xmath10 ) .",
    "a careful discussion of these two features was presented in @xcite , which we will not repeat here .",
    "whilst at first our use of the quasistatic approximations may may seem to limit the application of our work , we emphasize that quasistatic scales dominate current and near - future galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "testing modified gravity in the non - linear regime requires theory - specific n - body simulations . as mentioned in the introduction , these are only available for a limited handful of theories at present @xcite .",
    "an appealing feature of the quasistatic regime is that it allows many theories to be packaged in a simplified , generic form , as follows .",
    "consider a gravity theory involving a single additional scalar degree of freedom , eg .",
    "galileon gravity , @xmath11 gravity or scalar - tensor theories .",
    "perturbations of the scalar follow an equation of motion which , schematically , has the form : @xmath12\\delta\\phi&={\\cal s}\\left(a , \\phi , \\psi\\right ) \\label{jog}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective mass of the scalar is set by its potential , @xmath13 , and the source term @xmath14 depends upon the specifics of the theory in question . ) is probably not sufficiently general to cover all cases of interest .",
    "we are merely trying to convey the spirit of the derivation and the approximations involved , which can be applied more widely . ]",
    "when the quasistatic approximations above are applied , eq.([jog ] ) reduces to an algebraic relation between perturbations of the scalar and the gravitational potentials : @xmath15 this relation can then be used to eliminate @xmath9 from the linearized gravitational field equations .",
    "furthermore , terms in the linearized field equations containing @xmath16 can be dropped under point 2 ) above .",
    "one then finds that the poisson equation and the ` slip ' relation between the two metric potentials can be written in the form : @xmath17 where we have defined two time- and scale - dependent functions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "eqs.([poisson ] ) and ( [ slip ] ) can be thought of as a simple parameterization of modified gravity in the quasistatic regime : a theory corresponds to a particular choice of functional forms for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a more detailed derivation of these relations can be found in  of @xcite ; for some theory - specific examples see @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper should apply to any theory for which the quasistatic reduction to eqs.([poisson ] ) and ( [ slip ] ) is valid .",
    "this covers any model with a single new scalar degree of freedom ; note that this is _ not _ restricted to only simple scalar field models .",
    "for example , the spin-0 perturbations of a new vector field or the stckelberg field used to restore lorentz invariance to horava - lifschtiz gravity both act as scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "we highlight that the entire broad family of horndeski models is subject to our analysis @xcite .",

    "we warn the reader that @xmath27 should always be interpreted as a time - dependent quantity ; we will use @xmath28 to indicate the fractional energy density in matter _",
    "today_. in the quasistatic regime ( see  [ section : quasistatic ] ) the @xmath29 term dominates eq.([delta_evol ] ) , so to a good approximation : @xmath30 differentiating this expression with respect to conformal time and combining it with eq.([theta_evol ] ) we obtain : @xmath31 combining eqs.([poisson ] ) , ( [ slip ] ) and ( [ uio ] ) and using the friedmann equation to express we obtain : @xmath32 where we have defined @xmath33 . the quantity",

    "the unperturbed expansion history of any dark energy or modified gravity theory can be written in the form of the usual gr friedmann equation with a new fluid component , through a suitable choice of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "also , note that @xmath42 can generally be a function of scale , so we must allow for a possible scale - dependence of the growth rate , ; this is a common property of modified gravity theories which distinguish them from gr .    whilst the growth rate is of prime importance , in practice one",

    "we are _ already _ working within the context of _ spacetime _ linear perturbation theory .",
    "we are now going to perturb around @xmath50cdm+gr in _ model space _ by assuming that the functions @xmath42 and @xmath52 source small deviations @xmath53 from the growth rate predicted by the @xmath50cdm+gr model .",

    "we begin by decomposing @xmath0 into a zeroth - order part and a perturbation .",

    "effectively , the kernel acts purely as a weighting function .",
    "_ the entire theory - dependence of the modified growth rate is encoded in the source term @xmath73 _ which at each moment in time ( or @xmath38 ) is a degenerate combination of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "causality imposes that @xmath82 for @xmath83 ; clearly observables can not be affected by deviations from gr that occur _ after _ the time of observation .",
