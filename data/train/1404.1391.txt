    "entanglement between spatial regions in gauge theories is a subtle subject because the hilbert space of gauge - invariant states can not be factored into a direct product of hilbert spaces defined on each region . in general ,",
    "reduced density matrices and entanglement entropies in lattice gauge theories can be computed by relaxing the gauge constraint , or equivalently by minimally embedding the physical hilbert space in a larger space which does factorize into a direct product of states on each region @xcite .",
    "these methods yield sensible results , but they depend on assuming that the minimal extension of the hilbert space is the correct one ; it is natural to ask whether one can calculate gauge theory entanglement entropies without extending the hilbert space .",
    "this is indeed possible in certain special cases , both on the lattice and in the continuum @xcite ( also see @xcite for a review of some condensed - matter models for which such computations are available ) , and for certain conformal theories in particular a vast amount of holographic results can be found by using the ryu - takayanagi prescription @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "what can be said about a general setup , though ?",
    "an insightful recent paper by casini , huerta , and rosabal has highlighted that , in general , the need for auxiliary degrees of freedom disappears when the entanglement entropy in a lattice gauge theory is defined using a subalgebra of operators defined on one subset of lattice links @xcite .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be a subset of links of a given lattice , and let @xmath2 be an algebra of gauge - invariant operators supported on links in @xmath1 ( this need not be the maximal possible such algebra ) .",
    "the gauss law implies that @xmath2 has a nontrivial center @xmath3 , which is also the center of the algebra of gauge - invariant operators constructed on links @xmath4 that are not in @xmath1 . in the basis",
    "in which all @xmath3 generators are diagonal , the physical hilbert space can be split into superselection sectors , where @xmath5 is the set of eigenvalues of center generators . by tracing over the external degrees of freedom one",
    "can then construct a reduced density matrix @xmath6 as a direct sum of reduced density matrices in each sector .",
    "this matrix acts on the set of states @xmath7 that all live just in @xmath1 .",
    "this way one explicitly constructs the operator @xmath6 for which @xmath8 computes @xmath9 , the expectation of _ any _ @xmath10 in the full theory on the entire lattice .",
    "the associated entanglement entropy is then computed as the von neumann entropy of @xmath6 .",
    "all the older prescriptions for calculating the entanglement entropy via embedding are specific special cases of this procedure .    ref .",
    "@xcite left unresolved a few ambiguities ; in particular , their definitions of different choices of algebras @xmath2 were found to lead to different values of even the universal piece in the entanglement entropy . in this note",
    "we resolve these ambiguities for abelian gauge theories .",
    "we show that all algebras @xmath11 appropriate for a subset @xmath1 of the lattice lead to the same results for the entanglement entropy .",
    "furthermore , we argue that the entanglement entropy in a lattice gauge theory is naturally computed by splitting the lattice into two disjoint sets of links separated by a region ( _ buffer zone _ ) exactly one lattice spacing wide .",
    "different choices of algebras ( also called superselection rules , boundary conditions , or centers ) are simply found to correspond to different choices of bases for the degrees of freedom living in the buffer zone , and this is why the entanglement entropy is independent of the algebra choice .",
    "this paper is organized such that the build - up to our conclusion is gradual and stems from the framework established in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec setup ] we introduce our notation and set up some elementary @xmath0 lattice gauge theory framework . in sec .",
    "[ sec ebc ] we compute the reduced density matrix on a region @xmath1 with a particular choice of the algebra , @xmath12 , that is associated to imposing electric boundary conditions ; this construction is related to that of the `` electric center '' presented in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec mbc ] we introduce a class of related algebras @xmath11 and focus on a particular one , @xmath13 , which is associated to magnetic boundary conditions ( related but inequivalent to the `` magnetic center '' of @xcite ) .",
    "our punchline comes in sec .",
    "[ sec embc ] .",
    "we first show that the set @xmath14 contains all algebras that can be associated to the lattice subset @xmath1 , and next we show that all the boundary conditions defined in secs .",
    "[ sec ebc ] and [ sec mbc ] can be viewed as different choices of basis for the same set of degrees of freedom living in the buffer zone at the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the entanglement entropies @xmath15 associated to the algebras @xmath11 are all equal , and in the case of a topological state they correctly reproduce the expected results . in secs .",
    "[ sec u1 ] , [ sec matter ] , and [ sec continuum ] we show that our proposal has natural generalizations to theories with a continuous gauge group , theories with matter , and theories in a continuum .",

    "we work on a finite lattice with no non - trivial topology and with open boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath17 be the generator of the @xmath0 transformation , so that @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 lattice sites are labeled by @xmath20 , and the @xmath21 links are labeled either by a link index , @xmath22 , a pair of adjacent site indices , @xmath23 , or by a site and a direction , @xmath24 .",
    "the quantum variables @xmath25 live on links and take values in @xmath0 , so a single link hilbert space is isomorphic to @xmath26 .",

    "lattice links are directed , so if @xmath31 , the link of opposite direction is @xmath32 , and it is convenient to define @xmath33 and @xmath34 via finally , a state of the entire lattice system is denoted by @xmath35 , and it belongs to a hilbert space @xmath36 , with operators that are elements of the algebra @xmath37 .",
    "operators on different links all commute .",
    "henceforth , whenever we write @xmath38 ( for instance ) , we refer to the operator on the full lattice @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in systems invariant under the local transformation this transformation is implemented in terms of operators via in the above product there are exactly two momentum operators acting on each link , one acting in the direction of the link and one in the opposite direction .",
    "together they implement the desired local transformation . gauging this transformation , we demand that physical states are only those satisfying @xmath40 .",
    "this gauge - invariance constraint can be written as the gauss law , gauge - invariant operators ( those that preserve gauge - invariance of states ) are all momentum operators and all loops of position operators , so the gauge - invariant algebra @xmath41 is generated by operators that act as where @xmath42 is any plaquette",
    ". we will refer to them as * electric * and * magnetic generators * , respectively .",

    "the gauss law now states that a gauge - invariant state has a net zero flux flowing into each lattice site .",
    "evidently , the hilbert space of physical states , @xmath46 , is spanned by loops of constant electric flux , created and annihilated by the magnetic generators @xmath47 . as with the links ,",
    "each individual plaquette admits a hilbert space isomorphic to @xmath26 , and so we can view the physical hilbert space as a direct product over all plaquettes , from here on we will always work with the representation @xmath48 .",
    "consider partitioning the set of links into two disjoint subsets , @xmath1 and @xmath4 , such that each link is either in @xmath1 or in @xmath4 .",
    "the set @xmath49 of physical states over @xmath50 can not factorize into a tensor product of physical hilbert spaces over @xmath1 and over @xmath4 due to the gauss law constraint . to deal with this",
    ", we follow the spirit , if not the letter , of @xcite .",
    "let us focus on gauge - invariant operator subalgebras ( * electric algebras * ) @xmath12 and @xmath51 generated by electric and magnetic generators defined on all links and plaquettes that wholly lie in @xmath1 and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "indeed , we will show in the next section that a purely magnetic center can be constructed . in this section",
    "we focus on the simplest case of the pure electric center .",

    "the existence of superselection sectors means that @xmath49 ( i.e.  the set of electric eigenstates with flux running along loops , as discussed around eq .  ) can be written as a direct sum of @xmath81 s , the spaces of physical states with boundary electric operators having eigenvalues @xmath5 .",
    "this is just the sum over electric boundary conditions ( electric field configurations ) on @xmath53 .",
    "now each @xmath81 is individually decomposed into the tensor product of states on @xmath1 and @xmath4 with the given incoming ( or outgoing for the case of @xmath4 ) flux @xmath5 , so we have the decomposition we will henceforth let @xmath82 , and correspondingly @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that , according to , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number of plaquettes .",
    "the space of states on @xmath1 is thus defined as @xmath87 , and here we see the formal justification of the intuition that `` the gauss law should be relaxed '' when talking about entanglement @xcite .    any operator in @xmath67 can be written in block - diagonal form with @xmath88 blocks , each block being a square matrix with @xmath89 rows .",
    "the difference between @xmath69 and @xmath67 is generated by wilson loops ( magnetic generators ) around plaquettes containing links in both @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "these operators mix superselection sectors in a simple way : a magnetic generator that connects two vertices @xmath90 shifts the superselection sector from the one with @xmath91 to one with @xmath92 , depending on the direction of the loop .",
    "if the entire lattice is in a state described by a density matrix @xmath93 , the expectation value of an operator @xmath94 is as @xmath95 maps @xmath81 to itself , the only elements of the density matrix that enter the sum are those that belong to the same block - diagonal form found above .",
    "thus , for computing the reduced density matrix , we may replace @xmath93 by its block - diagonal restriction @xmath96 defined by @xmath97 in addition , we define with this definition all the matrices @xmath98 have unit trace and can be interpreted as density matrices themselves . the @xmath99 measure the trace of each block in @xmath93 ,",
    "and they obey @xmath100 .    in each superselection sector",
    "the hilbert space factorizes , so we can trace out the @xmath4 degrees of freedom in the usual way , getting the density matrix appropriate to electric boundary conditions , with we have now explicitly constructed the matrix @xmath101 that can be used to compute the expectation value of any @xmath94 by tracing out just the degrees of freedom in @xmath102 .",
    "this is precisely the reduced density matrix of interest , and the entanglement entropy can now be found as the von neumann entropy of @xmath101 , leading to the central equation in these notes : with this equation has already been featured in @xcite , and in a slightly different form in @xcite .    as a simple example ,",
    "if we start in a pure state @xmath103 in a definite electric sector @xmath104 , the initial density matrix will be @xmath105 . from eq .",
    "we have @xmath106 , and eq .   readily reveals that the associated entanglement entropy is thus , for any state for which the boundary electric fluxes are good quantum numbers , the entanglement entropy is evaluated as in any other field theory , with the single caveat that the fields being traced out must all be restricted to the correct boundary condition at @xmath53 provided by the starting state .",

    "] we can now once more turn the crank and find @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "tracing over @xmath4 links gives @xmath115 .",
    "this is a density matrix for a pure state , so @xmath116 and in case all superselection sectors have the same number of elements ( this is always true for sufficiently simple lattices ) , we have @xmath117 and we find this result ( in particular , the _ topological entanglement entropy",
    "_ piece @xmath118 ) was famously found in the early papers @xcite .",
    "it was also explicitly calculated in @xcite for the cubic lattice with @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and it is also precisely the result found using completely different tools by @xcite while studying the topological state of the @xmath121 gauge theory on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "we here see that the topological ( i.e.  loop group - invariant ) state in any @xmath0 gauge theory has the above entanglement entropy , as long as all superselection sectors have the same dimensionality ( there are no defects on the lattice , etc ) .",
    "this result shows that in a topological state there always exists an `` area law '' piece of the entropy , which is lattice - dependent and will diverge in the continuum limit , and a finite piece which is sensitive only to the global data ( number of disconnected components ) .",
    "so far , our discussion was largely parallel to @xcite . we introduce magnetic boundary conditions rather differently .",

    "it merely made us adopt a different basis in which to express the good quantum numbers .",
    "indeed , we have already glimpsed traces of the idea that the choice of algebra is related to just having to use a different basis for the same hilbert space @xmath102 defined in .",
    "we now formalize this notion .",
    "let us focus again on the superselection sectors present in the partition @xmath126 with purely electric boundary conditions .",
    "we have shown that these sectors can be labeled by the outgoing electric fluxes @xmath74 at each site @xmath75 . in the electric basis of gauge - invariant states ( spanned by eigenstates of products of electric generators along each plaquette , cf .",
    "eq .  ) , and given the electric fluxes on the buffer links wholly in @xmath1 and @xmath4 , the @xmath74 s are completely determined by the constant fluxes flowing along the plaquettes that are neither wholly in @xmath1 nor wholly in @xmath4 .",
    "these are nothing more than the buffer plaquettes .",
    "thus , both electric and magnetic boundary conditions ( and all the mixed ones in between ) can be realized by splitting the lattice into two completely disjoint sets of links , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , such that they are separated by a buffer zone as in fig .",
    "[ fig magn bdry ops ] .",
    "the choice of which boundary conditions we are working with is now simply the choice of whether we wish to label superselection sectors by eigenvalues of the magnetic flux through the buffer plaquettes or by eigenvalues of the electric flux along the buffer plaquettes .",
    "( recall that the magnetic flux operator on a plaquette @xmath42 is the magnetic generator @xmath216 , while the electric flux operator on that plaquette is @xmath217 ; eigenstates of the two are fourier transforms of each other . ) in particular , this implies that the matrices @xmath123 should all be related by unitary transformations that implement basis changes , and hence their von neumann entropies should all be equal , this means that even though we have defined @xmath123 so that @xmath218 just for @xmath219 , any @xmath123 will correctly calculate expectations for all operators in @xmath12 , the maximal algebra of operators on links in @xmath1 .",
    "we have just shown that _ any _ algebra that can be associated to @xmath1 gives the same entanglement entropy .",
    "it should be noted that the original construction of the electric center given in @xcite is much closer to the view we adopt in this section . in their construction",
    ", the electric center operators lived on links that were neither in @xmath131 nor in @xmath132 ; these are the links denoted by blue wavy lines in fig .",
    "[ fig el bdry ops ] .",
    "the set of these links is a subset of our buffer zone @xmath135 . instead of labeling electric fluxes flowing along the buffer plaquettes ,",
    "we could have indeed chosen to label electric fluxes on just a subset @xmath220 of links between adjacent buffer plaquettes .",
    "we do not take this approach , but it should be kept in mind that different bookkeeping choices like this may be used . in particular , the calculations of @xcite and @xcite are instances of using buffer links  not entire buffer plaquettes  and splitting them into gauge - invariant superpositions of gauge - variant states .",
    "thus , as soon as we choose a bipartition @xmath126 , we may identify the completely insulating buffer zones ( maximal @xmath135 s ) , and then all that remains is the choice of preferred bookkeeping ( basis labeling , etc ) for the degrees in freedom in these zones .",
    "the conclusion is that    _ entanglement entropies in lattice gauge theories are naturally associated to buffer zones , i.e.  to sets of plaquettes that fully insulate one part of the lattice from the other . _    in other words , unlike in theories of matter where entanglement boundaries are viewed as codimension - one surfaces in the spatial plane , in gauge theories the entanglement boundaries should be viewed as codimension - zero but minimally thin shells .",
    "the choice of electric , magnetic , or mixed boundary conditions is a choice of labeling the superselection sectors or of choosing center operators , and the entanglement entropy is not affected . for a given choice of boundary conditions , there always exists an unambiguous way to split the degrees of freedom in the buffer zone and integrate out the ones supported on links in @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure just happens to be very different in different bases , as our calculations above have shown . for calculational convenience ,",
    "a basis should be chosen such that the full density matrix is as close to diagonal as possible .",
    "having exhaustively treated the @xmath0 theory , we now briefly turn to the compact @xmath221 theory .",
    "the link variables @xmath194 now take values on an @xmath222 , and they are naturally described by an angle @xmath223 satisfying @xmath224 .",
    "non - abelian gauge theories are expressed similarly , by writing @xmath225 for lie algebra generators @xmath226 , but we will only focus on the abelian theory , where all electric operators can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "the electric generators now act as while magnetic generators @xmath227 act as shown earlier in .",
    "the electric eigenstates are and the situation is quite analogous to the @xmath0 theory ( whose limit @xmath228 heuristically reproduces the @xmath221 theory ) . in particular , the entire discussion of electric and magnetic boundary conditions , superselection sectors , and the entanglement entropy transfers wholesale with the single caveat that the hilbert space on each link is infinite - dimensional because @xmath161 takes all integer values , and hence the number of superselection sectors is infinite from the outset . we thus conclude that the entanglement entropy of a region @xmath1 insulated by a buffer zone is still given by , with @xmath229 being electric boundary conditions . notice that in this case , the entanglement entropy of the topological state diverges logarithmically .",
    "this is a uv divergence associated to short distances on the target manifold ( @xmath222 ) and it should be present in all gauge theories with continuous ( lie ) groups .",
    "we believe this is the gauge theory analogue of the divergence found in @xcite .",
    "adding a matter sector is also straightforward .",
    "let us return to studying the @xmath0 theory , and let us consider fundamental matter degrees of freedom that live on sites and take values in @xmath0 .",
    "at each site there is now a hilbert space isomorphic to @xmath26 with an operator algebra generated by the matter position and momentum operators that act as of course , position operators in other representations can be considered , but we focus on this one .",
    "the gauge transformation acts on matter states as @xmath230 , and the gauge - invariant operators are the charge operator @xmath231 and the wilson line operator @xmath232 . in the charge ( i.e.  electric )",
    "basis , the charge operators are diagonalized on each site , and the eigenstates @xmath233 satisfy in the electric basis , the gauge - invariant states at each link satisfy @xmath234 ; the gauss law is the usual statement that the sum of electric fluxes entering each site must be equal to the charge on that site .",
    "let us immediately approach partitioning the lattice by introducing a fully insulating buffer zone separating regions @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "this buffer zone now consists of links _ and _ sites .",
    "superselection sectors corresponding to electric boundary conditions are labeled by the eigenvalues of charge operators on sites and of electric flux operators on plaquettes in the buffer zone .",
    "for instance , on a square lattice in @xmath119 , each buffer plaquette is labeled by five eigenvalues , four charges at the square vertices and the electric flux along the entire perimeter ; two of the five are shared with adjacent buffer plaquettes . magnetic boundary conditions on the same plaquette entail diagonalizing the four wilson line operators on the sides of the square and the product of electric flux operators on the buffer plaquette and the two adjacent non - buffer plaquettes , if the adjacent plaquettes are labeled by electric boundary conditions .",
    "the two extreme choices of boundary conditions thus entail labeling superselection sectors by all electric flux ( glueball ) and matter charge configurations in the buffer zone ( purely electric boundary conditions ) or by all wilson lines in the buffer zone ( purely magnetic boundary conditions ) .",
    "of course , in this case the reduced density matrix will not be block - diagonal , even in the electric basis , but the same calculation as in sec .",
    "[ sec mbc ] can be carried out .",
    "note that in the case of a pure matter theory , all we need to do is to remove the gauss law constraint and the electric flux ( glueball ) operators from the electric center .",
    "the remaining labels of superselection sectors are then the charges on the vertices in the buffer zone .",
    "these can be factored into two sets and reabsorbed into traces over degrees of freedom , one set in @xmath1 and the other set in @xmath4 ; therefore the above prescription for gauge field entanglement entropy correctly reproduces the usual entanglement entropy in theories with only matter .",
    "finally , we remark that the prescription given in these notes naturally generalizes to the continuum case . whether the given lattice gauge theory has",
    "a continuum limit is a separate question , and it must be answered by carefully identifying any critical points in the parameter space of the given hamiltonian . however , it is useful to think about the different boundary conditions in a continuum picture , so here we provide the guidelines to how this works .    as the lattice spacing",
    "is taken to zero , the buffer zone @xmath53 becomes infinitely thin and can be regarded as a codimension - one surface . in the case of electric boundary conditions ,",
    "the sum over superselection sectors now becomes an integral over all possible electric fields @xmath235 perpendicular to @xmath53 , or equivalently an integral over all configurations of glueballs confined to the interior of @xmath53 .",
    "for purely magnetic boundary conditions , the sum over superselection sectors becomes an integral over all possible magnetic fields @xmath236 tangential to @xmath53 . for @xmath119",
    ", @xmath237 is essentially a scalar quantity that measures the flux piercing the spatial plane along @xmath53 . for @xmath119 ,",
    "@xmath236 is a vector and we may choose any of its components to label the superselection sectors .",
    "mixed boundary conditions now mean that we choose different patches of @xmath53 and on each we impose either electric or magnetic conditions .",
    "the presence of matter forces us to include all charge configurations ( for electric boundary conditions ) or wilson lines ( for magnetic boundary conditions ) on the entangling boundary .",
    "it is of note that the labels of superselection sectors precisely organize following the familiar boundary conditions of electrodynamics , where changes of fields @xmath238 and @xmath239 between two environments are respectively related to the charge density and the surface current density on the boundary .",
    "the notion of @xmath238 labeling superselection sectors has already appeared in @xcite .",
    "what divergences can be associated to the continuum limit ?",
    "this question is generally out of the scope of these notes , but a glimpse into its answer is afforded by the formula for the entanglement entropy of the topological state .",
    "the non - extensive piece @xmath118 will remain finite in the continuum limit . on the other hand",
    ", the area law term will take the form @xmath240 and will diverge as the lattice spacing @xmath241 is taken to zero .",
    "it is reassuring that the universal term ( topological entanglement entropy ) survives the continuum limit .",
    "we have provided a natural framework for thinking about entanglement in abelian gauge theories .",
    "the ideas given here are a generalization and reformulation of many older results .",
    "the main take - away message of these notes is that entanglement entropy is naturally defined on a codimension - zero shell ( the `` buffer zone '' ) between two spatial regions , and that the previous calculations of entanglement entropies in lattice gauge theories can be seen as computations with different basis choices for the degrees of freedom in the buffer zone .",
    "explicit computation of the entropy is possible and very easy in certain cases of interest .",
    "there exists a host of directions for further research .",
    "a natural extension of this work concerns non - abelian theories and different representation choices of wilson loops and matter fields",
    ". it would be fascinating to understand whether the entanglement entropy takes on a particularly simple form in the large @xmath159 limit .",
    "a further immediate association is the exploration of implications of our prescription to understanding the ryu - takayanagi formula ; perhaps generalizations of the holographic entanglement entropy of @xcite can be given a firmer interpretation , and perhaps the exact holographic mapping @xcite can also be fruitfully applied to our lattice computations .",
    "another alluring topic to which our results may be applied is the study of entanglement entropies in gravity theories , as discussed in e.g.  @xcite",
    ".    it would also be interesting to study entanglement entropy from a purely lattice - based point of view , both analytically and numerically .",
    "for instance , one can ask whether entanglement entropy on its own can be used to detect different phases of quantum systems .",
