    "ideal crystals are absent in nature , and most of their physical properties , such as plasticity , melting , growth , etc . , are defined by defects of the crystalline structure .",
    "therefore , a study of defects is a topical scientific question of importance for applications in the first place . at present",
    ", a fundamental theory of defects is absent in spite of the existence of dozens of monographs and thousands of articles .",
    "one of the most promising approaches to the theory of defects is based on riemann  cartan geometry , which involves nontrivial metric and torsion . in this approach ,",
    "a crystal is considered as a continuous elastic medium with a spin structure .",
    "if the displacement vector field is a smooth function , then there are only elastic stresses corresponding to diffeomorphisms of the euclidean space .",
    "if the displacement vector field has discontinuities , then we are saying that there are defects in the elastic structure .",
    "defects in the elastic structure are called dislocations and lead to the appearance of nontrivial geometry . precisely , they correspond to a nonzero torsion tensor , equal to the surface density of the burgers vector .",
    "defects in the spin structure are called disclinations .",
    "they correspond to nonzero curvature tensor , curvature tensor being the surface density of the frank vector .",
    "the idea to relate torsion to dislocations appeared in the 1950s [ 14 ] .",
    "this approach is still being successfully developed ( note reviews [ 511 ] ) , and is often called the gauge theory of dislocations .",
    "some time ago we proposed the geometrical theory of defects [ 1214 ] .",
    "our approach is essentially different from others in two respects .",
    "firstly , we do not have the displacement vector field and rotational vector field as independent variables because , in general , they are not continuous . instead ,",
    "the triad field and @xmath0-connection are considered as independent variables .",
    "if defects are absent , then the triad and @xmath0-connection reduce to partial derivatives of the displacement and rotational angle vector fields . in this case the latter can be reconstructed .",
    "secondly , the set of equilibrium equations is different .",
    "we proposed purely geometric set which coincides with that of euclidean three dimensional gravity with torsion .",
    "the nonlinear elasticity equations and principal chiral @xmath0 model for the spin structure enter the model through the elastic and lorentz gauge conditions [ 1416 ] which allow to reconstruct the displacement and rotational angle vector fields in the absence of dislocations in full agreement with classical models .",
    "the advantage of the geometric theory of defects is that it allows one to describe singele defects as well as their continuous distributions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider propagation of torsional elastic waves in cylindrical waveguide with wedge dislocation .",
    "it is a classical problem which was solved in the absence of defect long ago within the elasticity theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the wedge dislocation changes the dispersion relation . for positive deficit angles the phase velocity increases and group velocity decreases .",
    "negative deficit angles have opposite consequences .",
    "let us introduce notation and remind necessary facts from differential geometry .",
    "we consider elastic media as topologically trivial manifold which is diffeomorphic to euclidean space @xmath1 .",
    "denote cartesian coordinate system by @xmath2 , @xmath3 . without dislocations ,",
    "the elastic media is described by the euclidean metric @xmath4 .",
    "if dislocations are present then the metric becomes nontrivial : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the triad .",
    "the triad field defines the orthonormal basis of the tangent spaces at each point @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the inverse triad .",
    "we shall see that this basis is more convenient in applications .",
    "assume that relative displacements for elastic deformations are much smaller then deformations caused by defects : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are components of the displacement vector field with respect to orthonormal basis in the tangent space @xmath11 .",
    "then in the first approximation , the elastic waves propagate in riemannian space with nontrivial metric produced by dislocations . here",
    "we neglect changes in the metric produced by elastic waves themselves .",
    "therefore for elastic waves in media with defects we postulate the following wave equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are lame coefficients , @xmath15 is the covariant laplace ",
    "beltrami operator for the triad field @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the explicit form of the covariant derivative is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath0-connection constructed for zero torsion .",
    "note that the displacement vector field @xmath20 is not the total displacement vector field of points in the media with dislocations . in those regions where defects are absent",
    ", the total displacement vector is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dislocation part of the displacement vecor field which produces the triad @xmath23 .",
    "note also that the smallness of relative elastic deformations ( [ edueco ] ) is meaningful at those regions where displacements @xmath22 are not defined ( they are not continuous functions if dislocations are present ) .",
    "the expression for the deformation tensor @xmath24 is needed to pose the boundary value problem for wave equation ( [ ephops ] ) . in the presence of defects",
    "the deformation tensor is defined as follows @xmath25    thus the existence of dislocations in media results in the introduction of the triad field @xmath6 , metric @xmath26 , and replacement of partial derivatives by covariant ones .",
    "remember that lowering of latin indices is performed using the euclidean metric , @xmath27 , and it commutes with covariant differentiation .",
    "we consider cylindrical waveguide of radius @xmath28 with a wedge dislocation . its axis is assumed to coincide with the axis of cylinder .",
    "we choose cylindrical coordinate system @xmath29 , the @xmath30 axis coinciding with the cylinder axis as well .",
    "let the wedge dislocation has deficit angle @xmath31 ( see fig.[fwedis ] )    . for negative and positive @xmath32 , the wedge is cut out or added , respectively . ]",
    "if @xmath33 , then the wedge is cut out from the cylinder .",
    "dislocation is absent for @xmath34 . for positive deficit angle , @xmath35 , the wedge of media",
    "is added to the cylinder .",
    "the cylinder contains wedge dislocation , and it creates nontrivial metrics .",
    "the metric becomes noneuclidean @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and we introduce dimensionless constant @xmath38 the constant @xmath39 is defined by dimensionless poisson ratio @xmath40 which characterize elastic properties of media .",
    "thermodynamical arguments restrict possible values of poisson ratio to @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath42 corresponds to absence of the dislocation .",
    "metric ( [ qnhsth ] ) is rotationally and translationally invariant .",
    "two dimensional metric on sections @xmath43 is the metric of conical singularity which arises due to the wedge dislocation .",
    "it is important that this metric is written in elastic gauge and therefore is consistent with the elasticity theory @xcite .",
    "metric for the wedge dislocation ( [ qnhsth ] ) is defined for all deficit angles @xmath44 and all values of radial coordinate @xmath45 .",
    "it is degenerate on the dislocation axis @xmath46 .",
    "metric ( [ qnhsth ] ) coincide with the induced metric in classical elasticity theory only for small deficit angles and near the boundary of the cylinder @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "metric for the wedge dislocation defines the triad field which we choose to be diagonal : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the absence of dislocation , @xmath51",
    ", it defines the usual orthonormal basis for tangent spaces in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the inverse triad is @xmath52    to find the explicit form of the wave operator , we need to compute christoffel s symbols and components of @xmath0-connection .",
    "straightforward calculations show that only for christoffel s symbols differ from zero : @xmath53 triad ( [ qbndhy ] ) defines also components of @xmath0-connection @xmath54",
    "only two components differ from zero : @xmath55    now we can compute the laplacian @xmath56 substitution of explicit expressions for christoffel s symbols ( [ qbnxgs ] ) and @xmath0-connection ( [ qmnjpo ] ) yields the following expressions : @xmath57    \\tilde\\triangle u_{\\hat\\vf}&=\\left(\\frac ar\\right)^{2\\g-2}\\frac1r{\\partial}_r    \\big(r{\\partial}_ru_{\\hat\\vf}\\big)+\\left(\\frac ar\\right)^{2\\g-2}\\frac{\\g^2}{{\\alpha}^2 r^2 }    { \\partial}^2_{\\vf\\vf}u_{\\hat\\vf}+{\\partial}^2_{zz}u_{\\hat\\vf}- \\\\    & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad    -\\left(\\frac ar\\right)^{2\\g-2}\\frac{\\g^2}{r^2}u_{\\hat\\vf }    + 2\\left(\\frac ar\\right)^{2\\g-2}\\frac{\\g^2}{{\\alpha}r^2}{\\partial}_{\\varphi}u_{\\hat r } , \\\\[2 mm ]    \\tilde\\triangle u_{\\hat z}&=\\left(\\frac ar\\right)^{2\\g-2}\\frac1r{\\partial}_r    \\big(r{\\partial}_r u_{\\hat z}\\big)+\\left(\\frac",

    "the simplest one describes torsional waves for which only the angular component @xmath58 differs from zero and does not depend on the angular coordinate @xmath59 : @xmath60 it is easy to see that torsional waves take place without media compression @xmath61 for these oscillations , wave equations @xmath62 and @xmath63 are identically satisfied , and we are left with one wave equation @xmath64    we look for solution of this equation in the plain wave form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the wave amplitude , @xmath67 is the wave vector , and @xmath68 is the wave frequency .",
    "then wave equation ( [ qbnckj ] ) takes the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 now we introduce new radial coordinate @xmath71 then equation ( [ qnhdyt ] ) reduces to the bessel equation @xmath72 where @xmath73 a general solution to the bessel equation has two integration constants .",
