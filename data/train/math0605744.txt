    "quasipositive braids are products of conjugates of a positive standard generater of the braid group ; they generalize the class of positive braids .",
    "a quasipositive knot is a knot which is isotopic to the closure of a quasipositive braid .",
    "quasipositive knots emerged from the theory of complex plane curves ( @xcite ) . from certain viewpoints ,",
    "quasipositive knots are ` dense ' in the set of knots .",
    "for instance , every alexander polynomial can be realized by a quasipositive knot ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar statement is true for vassiliev invariants ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we prove another density result for quasipositive knots , involving unoriented cobordisms .",
    "a cobordism between two disjoint links @xmath0 , @xmath1 is a smooth embedded surface @xmath2 whose boundary is precisely @xmath3 .",
    "we distinguish between oriented and unoriented cobordisms , depending on whether the surface and its boundary components are oriented or not . in this paper",
    ", we consider particular unoriented cobordisms , namely punctured mbius bands embedded in @xmath4 .    for every knot @xmath5",
    "there exists a quasipositive fibred knot @xmath6 and an embedded punctured mbius band @xmath7 whose boundary components are precisely @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be an element of the braid group on @xmath11 strings .",
    "we may assume that the first letter of @xmath12 is a negative standard generator of @xmath13 , since we can always insert a canceling pair @xmath14 in front of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , there exist a natural number @xmath15 , natural numbers @xmath16 , and positive ( possibly empty ) words @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 let @xmath8 be an arbitrary knot .",
    "@xmath8 is isotopic to the closure of a braid @xmath19 , written as in ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "the closure of @xmath12 is depicted in figure  1 .",
    "@xmath22 is clearly a quasipositive braid , since all its negative letters appear in conjugating pairs , together with their positive counterparts : @xmath23 let @xmath9 be the closure of @xmath22 , as depicted in figure  2 .",
    "a quick comparison with figure  1 shows that @xmath9 is also a knot .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 is a quasipositive knot .",
    "next , we construct an embedded punctured mbius band whose boundary components are @xmath8 and @xmath9 : choose any embedded annulus @xmath24 , one of whose boundary components is the closure of @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "glue a mbius band to @xmath25 , woven as the additional band of @xmath12 , as shown in figure  3 .",
    "the two boundary components of the resulting punctured mbius band are isotopic to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    at last ,",
    "we construct a natural fibre surface @xmath26 for @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath26 is a union of @xmath27 discs , one for each braid strand of @xmath22 , and several bands with a positive half twist .",
    "each positive crossing corresponds to such a twisted band , except in the neighbourhood of negative crossings , where we choose twisted bands as shown in figure  4 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the core curve of a hopf band in @xmath26 , which we may deplumb without affecting the attribute of fibredness or non - fibredness .",
    "thus we may cut the upper left twisted band and obtain the surface @xmath28 shown on the left hand side of figure  5 .",
    "the surface @xmath28 in turn is isotopic to the canonical seifert surface of a positive braid , as shown on the right hand side of figure  5 ( slide the long band along the upper band ) .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem  1 , since canonical seifert surfaces of positive braids are fibre surfaces .      1 .",
    "the knot @xmath9 is even strongly quasipositive , in the sense of l.  rudolph ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is absolutely essential that the surface @xmath29 be orientable .",
    "indeed , there exist strong restrictions on the euler number of oriented cobordisms between quasinegative and quasipositive knots ( e.g. the rasmussen invariant ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the application of one saddle point move inside the dashed circle at the bottom right of figure  2 transforms @xmath9 into @xmath8 . here",
    "a saddle point move is a local move that acts on link diagrams , as shown in figure  6 . in @xcite ,",
    "hoste , nakanishi and taniyama proved that a simple crossing change can be expressed as a sequence of two saddle point moves .",
    "therefore , it is an unknotting operation ."
