    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "a second important feature worth noting is that channels with leptons in the final state typically lead to weaker restrictions on the parameter space than modes involving hadrons .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that the electroweak sm gauge bosons dominantly decay hadronically .",
    "numerically , one has @xmath125 and @xmath126 , while @xmath127 and @xmath128  @xcite .",
    "the strong suppression of the leptonic decay widths overcompensates the higher detection efficiencies of final states involving leptons , and as a result the lhc searches for @xmath129 are superior to those looking for @xmath130 signals .",
    "our third observation is that the latest mono - jet data are evidently more constraining than the recent vbf @xmath30 search .",
    "while these analyses explore the same final state , i.e.  @xmath33 , they probe quite different parts of the phase space .",
    "in fact , the selection criterion that has the biggest impact in our study is the rather loose missing transverse energy cut of @xmath85 imposed in the vbf @xmath30 search . this selection is tailored for a higgs boson of @xmath131 , but fares less well if one tries to probe higher - dimensional operators of the form ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "since the operators @xmath110 ( @xmath132 ) and @xmath111 ( @xmath133 ) produce a rather hard @xmath6 spectrum , more severe @xmath6 requirements allow for a cleaner separation between signal and sm background .      until now we have have studied the constraints on the new - physics scale @xmath10 as a function of the dm mass @xmath134 , keeping the values of the high - scale wilson coefficients fixed . in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we instead show contours of constant  @xmath10 in the @xmath135@xmath136 plane . in all plots we employ @xmath137 and set @xmath138",
    ". the first noticeable feature of the shown predictions is that only the mono - photon signal depends more strongly on @xmath21 than @xmath22 , while for all the other @xmath6 channels the situation is reversed .",
    "second , with the exception of the mono - photon case , one observes that the major axes of the elliptic contours in all panels are almost aligned with the @xmath119 axes .",
    "this means that interference effects between contributions arising from @xmath110 and @xmath111 are small in all of these cases .",
    "the third important property following from the colour shading of the depicted results is that currently either the newest mono - photon or the mono - jet data provide the leading bounds in the entire @xmath135@xmath136 plane .",
    "this feature is further illustrated by the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . in this plot",
    "the overlaid numbers indicate the search strategy that contributes the best sensitivity on @xmath10 at each point , with 1 and 5 corresponding to the mono - photon and mono - jet channel , respectively .",
    "one sees that if the ratio of wilson coefficients satisfies @xmath139 then the limit  ( [ eq:4 ] ) gives rise to the strongest constraint , while in the remaining @xmath135@xmath136 plane the bound  ( [ eq:14 ] ) is most restrictive .",
    "the @xmath10 contours obtained by combining all available @xmath6 channels are depicted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "finally , we note that the values of @xmath10 that can be excluded with the current data are low compared to typical lhc energies . in order to go beyond the eft description",
    ", one has to specify a ultraviolet ( uv ) completion , where the operators in ( [ eq:4 ] ) arise from a renormalisable theory after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom mediating the interactions .",
    "uv - complete models that generate the operators @xmath110 and @xmath111 through loops of states charged under @xmath14 and/or @xmath16 have been proposed in @xcite and their lhc signatures have been studied in @xcite . if these new charged particles are light , the high-@xmath140 gauge bosons that participate in the @xmath6 processes considered here are able to resolve the substructure of the loops .",
    "this generically suppresses the cross sections compared to the eft predictions  @xcite , and thus will weaken the bounds on the interaction strengths of dm and the electroweak gauge bosons to some extent .",
    "furthermore , the light charged mediators may be produced on - shell in @xmath141 collisions , rendering direct lhc searches potentially more restrictive than @xmath6 searches .",
    "making the above statements precise would require a study of a concrete uv completion .",
    "it is also interesting to explore how the reach on the new - physics scale @xmath10 might improve at the @xmath5 lhc . in",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] we observe that for @xmath111 ( @xmath133 ) the combination @xmath195 is indeed positive ( negative ) .",
    "defining a significance as @xmath198 , we get from  ( [ eq:21 ] ) the values @xmath199 and @xmath200 , while  ( [ eq:22 ] ) leads to @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "our toy mc study corresponding to @xmath154 ( @xmath185 ) of data hence suggest that a distinction between the azimuthal angle distributions of @xmath111 and @xmath133 at the @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) level should be possible at the @xmath5 lhc .",
    "we emphasise that our toy study assumes a perfect detector and that we have not optimised the cuts ( [ eq:18 ] ) to achieve the best significance .",
    "once the data is on tape , it will become an experimental issue of how stringent the vbf - like selections can be made to extract the most information on the jet - jet angular correlations for a given limited sample size .",
    "in this article we have studied lhc constraints on effective dimension-7 operators that couple dm to the sm electroweak gauge bosons and emphasised the complementarity of different @xmath6 searches for constraining the associated wilson coefficients .",
    "focusing on the interactions that induce only velocity - suppressed annihilation rates , we have combined the information on all individual search modes that are available after lhc run-1 . in this way we are able to derive bounds on the new - physics scale @xmath10",
    "that exceed all previous limits .",
    "our studies show that at present , depending on the choice of parameters , either mono - photon or mono - jet searches provide the most severe constraints on the considered dimension-7 interactions . for dm masses @xmath205 and wilson coefficients @xmath206 ,",
    "the existing @xmath4 lhc searches allow to exclude values of @xmath10 below about @xmath207 at @xmath208 .",
    "the improved reach of @xmath6 analyses in 2015 and beyond is also studied , finding that with @xmath184 of @xmath5 data , lhc mono - jet searches should be able to improve the latter bound to approximately @xmath209 . beyond this point",
    "further progress will be hindered by the imperfect understanding of irreducible sm backgrounds such as @xmath158 .",
    "finding ways to overcome these limitations will be crucial to exploit the full physics potential of @xmath6 searches to be carried out at later stages of the lhc .",
    "we have furthermore emphasised that given the large statistics expected at the phase-1 and phase-2 upgrades of the @xmath5 lhc , @xmath6 searches should be able to not only determine integrated , but also differential cross sections . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "such normalised distributions have the clear advantage , that compared to the total cross sections theoretical uncertainties are reduced and that the obtained predictions depend only weakly on the assumptions underlying the eft description . as an example we have explored the prospects to measure jet - jet angular correlations in @xmath39 events .",
    "taking into account the pseudorapidity correlations of the two tagging jets , the resulting distributions in the azimuthal angle separation @xmath159 exhibit the relative strength of cp - even and cp - odd interactions of dm with gauge boson pairs .",
    "our toy mc studies indicate that already with @xmath154 of data a distinction between the new - physics and the sm - only hypotheses can be achieved at a statistically significant level , and that the sensitivity of the discussed searches is greatly improved by going to @xmath185 of luminosity .",
    "a more precise determination of the analysing power , including systematic uncertainties would require a full detector simulation , which is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "we however believe that it is imperative that the atlas and cms collaborations direct some activity towards the study of differential distributions of final states like @xmath33 .",
