    "the recent progresses in the growth and manipulation techniques of semiconductor heterostructures have recently led to the realization of planar semiconductor microcavities in which a cavity - photonic mode is strongly coupled to an excitonic transition , so that the resulting elementary excitations consist of linear superpositions of cavity - photon and exciton , the so - called _ polaritons _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the polaritons satisfy the bose statistics , at least in a low - density regime , and have recently started to be considered as potential candidates for the study of many - body effects , e.g. superfluidity  @xcite , in regimes completely different from the ones usually considered in experiments with helium fluids  @xcite or ultracold atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "a further advantage of polaritonic systems consists of the fact that polaritons can be optically injected in the cavity by simply shining an incident light beam onto it , and their properties can then be inferred from the observation of the emitted light . in particular , the coherence properties of the light emission closely reproduce the ones of the in - cavity polaritonic field  @xcite .    thanks to their excitonic component , polaritons have strong binary interactions , which have been exploited to obtain spectacular polariton amplification and optical parametric oscillation effects  @xcite .",
    "differently from conventional optical resonators with a discrete set of optical modes , planar microcavities are spatially extended systems with a continuum of transverse modes and the parametric oscillation process automatically selects the most favourable one in which to generate the coherent signal field .",
    "simultaneously with these experiments , an active debate has taken place in the community about the relation between the appearance of spontaneous coherence in optical parametric oscillation in planar microcavities and bose - einstein condensation of excitons  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to shine light on analogies and differences between the two phenomena : both of them are in fact characterized by the appearance of coherence and long - range order in a bose field  @xcite .",
    "there is however a major difference : while bose - einstein condensation is an equilibrium phenomenon , parametric oscillation takes place in intrinsically out - of - equilibrium systems , where the stationary state arises from a dynamical equilibrium between the driving by the pump and the dissipative effects due to losses . from this point of view",
    ", the parametric oscillation threshold is closely related to the laser threshold  @xcite , although standard laser cavities have a finite number of discrete modes .    in order to perform quantitative calculations ,",
    "a monte carlo technique based on the wigner representation of a quantum field  @xcite has been generalized to the case of a pair of coupled excitonic and cavity - photonic fields and the resulting numerical code has been used to calculate the one - time correlation functions of the in - cavity field in the stationary state , in particular the first- and second - order ones . as already mentioned , these univocally determine the spatial coherence properties of the emitted light which can be measured in the experiments .",
    "the advantages of the wigner - monte carlo approach with respect to previous works on the subject  @xcite are manyfold : first of all , we keep track in a complete way of the fluctuations of the polaritonic field , even in the critical region around the threshold , where fluctuations are large and the linearized approaches around the mean - field  @xcite fail .",
    "furthermore , no few - mode approximation  @xcite is here performed : the parametric emission into all available modes is automatically taken into account , as well as the correlations between all modes .    above threshold , the signal emission in planar microcavity geometries occurs in the single , most favourable , mode ( which the numerical code is able to automatically select ) and therefore shows the typical spatial coherence properties of a bose - einstein condensate . as it is not inherited from the pump beam , this coherence is a _ spontaneous _ one .",
    "on the other hand , the parametric emission from reduced - dimensionality systems such as photon wires  @xcite shows dramatically different properties : as long - wavelength fluctuations of the signal phase are here able to destroy the long - range spatial coherence , the threshold is no longer well defined and is replaced by a smooth crossover where a local order sets in and the intensity fluctuations of the signal emission are suppressed .",
    "such a behaviour is closely related to the so - called quasi - condensation phenomenon of equilibrium bose gases in reduced dimensionalities  @xcite .",
    "related questions about the spontaneous appearance of long - range coherence and the effect of a reduced dimensionality have been recently adressed  @xcite for the simpler case of a parametric oscillator formed by a planar resonator containing a slab of generic @xmath0 medium without any excitonic resonance .",
    "the plan of the present paper is the following : in sec.[sec : hamilt ] we introduce the field - theoretical hamiltonian of the system and we relate the properties of the emitted light to the ones of the in - cavity polaritonic field . in sec.[sec : mft ] , we work out the corresponding mean - field theory and we use it to identify the parameter range which is most suited for the following analysis . in sec.[sec : wigner ] , we review the wigner representation formalism and we generalize it to the case of coupled cavity - photon and exciton fields .",
    "we also describe the principles of the numerical code used to obtain the results which are discussed in the following . in sec.[sec : coherence2d ] , the central numerical results of the paper are shown : the behaviour of the first- and second - order coherence properties of the signal emission are presented for pump parameters spanning across the parametric threshold .",
    "these results are the basis of the discussion of the following sec.[sec : analogybec ] , where analogies and differences between our driven - dissipative system and the bose - einstein condensation phenomenon of equilibrium statistical mechanics are pointed out .",
    "sec.[sec : modulational ] , an alternative interpretation of the parametric threshold in terms of modulation instability and spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry is given and its consequences on the intensity correlation function are put forward . the effect of a reduced dimensionality is discussed in sec.[sec:1d ] , where the link with the concept of quasi - condensate is evidentiated .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec : conclu ] we give our conclusions , and we sketch the perspectives of the work .",

    "the exciton dispersion is instead much weaker and can be well approximated by a constant @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the rabi frequency of the exciton - cavity photon coupling : the eigenmodes of the linear hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilt_lin ] ) are therefore linear combination of the cavity photonic and excitonic modes .",
    "they are called upper ( @xmath15 ) and lower ( @xmath16 ) polariton and their dispersion is given by @xmath17 .",

    "@xmath19 are external potential terms acting on the excitonic and photonic fields and can be used to model etched cavities  @xcite .    differently from other bose systems such as ultracold trapped atoms or liquid helium ,",
    "our polaritonic system is intrinsically out of equilibrium .",
    "polaritons are in fact injected in the cavity by incident light beams and decay through several dissipative channels . in the present paper , polaritons are coherently injected in the cavity by a coherent _ pump _ laser , which is taken into account in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilt_tot ] ) by the driving term proportional to the incident electric field @xmath20 of the pump .",
    "for a given cavity , the coefficient @xmath21 can be calculated from the reflectivity of the front mirror through which the cavity is excited  @xcite .",

    "is generally retrieved by detecting and characterizing the light emission from the cavity through either the front or the back mirror . in particular ,",
    "the normally - ordered expectation values for the light emitted through the back mirror ( called in the following _ transmitted _ light ) are proportional to the corresponding ones for the photonic component of the in - cavity polaritonic field .",
    "for instance , the near - field amplitude of the transmitted field is @xmath28 where the coefficient",
    "@xmath29 relating the transmitted field to the in - cavity one has to be calculated from the transmittivity of the back mirror  @xcite .",

    "a simple way of coping with the field hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamilt_tot ] ) is to study the corresponding classical field theory once the quantum field operators @xmath3 are replaced with classical @xmath32-number fields @xmath33 defined as the expectation value of the quantum field @xmath34 . for a system of weakly - interacting bosons like microcavity polaritons ,",
    "fluctuations are generally weak provided the mean - field solution is dynamically stable , so that the mean - field solution provides accurate predictions for the coherent part of the polariton field , and therefore the coherent emission from the microcavity .",

    ", the mean - field prediction for the threshold intensity will be used as a guideline in the choice of parameters to be used in the numerical calculations .",
    "as we are most interested in the basic properties of the parametric instability threshold , we have tried to identify a configuration where the intrinsic phenomenology is not masked by additional effects . in particular , we have considered the case of a homogeneous cavity with no external potential @xmath35 and a transversally homogeneous , monochromatic and cw laser field of frequency @xmath36 which incides on the cavity at an angle @xmath37 with the normal to the cavity plane . provided the beam actually used in the experiment",

    "an analytical study of the mean - field stationary state in the parametric oscillation regime when translational symmetry is broken is beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "the incidence angle @xmath37 has been taken slightly larger than the so - called magic angle , so that @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding bogoliubov dispersions are plotted in fig.[fig : bogo ] : as expected , the first feature that takes place is the parametric instability when the @xmath62 branches , which are coupled by the anti - hermitian terms of ( [ eq : bogo_l ] ) , touch around @xmath63 .",
    "this condition @xmath64 can be interpreted as the parametric process @xmath65 becoming resonant on the final state .    for our specific choice of @xmath37 and @xmath59 , notice that this happens at a value @xmath66 still red - detuned with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "this guarantees that we are still in an optical limiter regime and no single - mode optical bistability effects  @xcite has yet taken place . in the following of the paper , the frequency @xmath67 will be designed as the parametric instability threshold and the wording below / above threshold will refer to @xmath59 respectively red- or blue - detuned with respect to @xmath67 .",

    "a more complete analysis of the parametric threshold can be carried out by numerically solving the stochastic equations of the wigner representation of the quantum bose field .",

    "@xmath117 is nearly flat and equal to @xmath118 , which indicates that the first - order coherence extends over the whole two - dimensional sample , or , in other terms , that the emission is phase coherent .",
    "as expected for a coherent field , the second - order coherence function @xmath130 is also almost flat and its value close to @xmath118 : in physical terms , this means that the intensity fluctuations of the signal emission are weak .",
    "both these qualitative behaviours are in agreement with the experimental observations reported in ref ..",
    "the analogy between the threshold of a optical parametric oscillator or of a laser and a sort of non - equilibrium second - order phase transition was put forward in the 70s  @xcite , but its study was mostly focussed on the case of few - mode systems , such as optical resonators with discrete modes . its generalization",
    "to spatially extended systems showing a continuum of modes is instead a much more recent topic from both the theoretical  @xcite and the experimental  @xcite points of view . in the present section , we shall try to interpret the results presented in the previous section in terms of a sort of non - equilibrium bose - einstein condensation .    at the level of mean - field theory , the analogy is immediate : in usual statistical mechanics , the onset of a phase transition is signalled by the thermodynamical instability of the symmetric state and the consequent appearance of a non - vanishing value of the order parameter in the equilibrium state . for the specific case of the bose - einstein condensation transition ,",
    "the order parameter consists of the expectation value of the bose field @xmath148 .    in the present non - equilibrium case",
    ", the mean - field threshold corresponds to the point where the homogeneous solution ( [ eq : ss_x ] ) and ( [ eq : ss_c ] ) becomes unstable and a finite signal and idler amplitudes appear in the new stable stationary state . as in the standard theory of the optical parametric oscillator ,",
    "the absolute phases of the signal and the idler are not determined .",
    "the hamiltonian is in fact invariant under the @xmath149 symmetry which sends @xmath150 and the specific value of the phase is randomly chosen at each realization by the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "the chosen value of the order parameter is the same throughout the whole system .",
    "quantitative results to illustrate the physics of this spontaneous symmetry breaking are obtained from the wigner - monte carlo calculations including the fluctuations around the mean - field which smoothen the threshold .",
    "because of the fluctuations , the signal and idler amplitudes no longer vanish below threshold , but as the signal and idler emissions take place into many available modes which are close to resonance , they are incoherent both spatially and temporally . as the threshold is approached , the characteristic coherence length which determines the spatial behaviour of the first- and second - order coherence functions @xmath147 increases and becomes macroscopic at the threshold . simultaneously",
    ", the intensity fluctuations , quantified by @xmath151 , are quenched .    above the threshold ,",
    "the parametric emission is concentrated in a single pair of modes , whose amplitude is accurately described by a @xmath32-number as in the mean - field theory .",
    "fluctuations give only a small correction .",
    "in particular , the signal and idler phases are constant throughout the whole two - dimensional sample .",
    "as it is usual in the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena , this does not violate the @xmath149 symmetry of the system hamiltonian , since the phase is chosen at random .",
    "these behaviours are strictly analogous to what happens in a bose gas at thermal equilibrium when the temperature is lowered across the bose - einstein condensation temperature @xmath152 . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the gas is a thermal , incoherent , one and is spread among many low - lying modes .",
    "its coherence extends for a finite distance , generally smaller than the interparticle spacing , and the same coherence length determines the spatial behaviour of both the phase ( first- ) and the density - density ( second - order ) correlation function of the gas . for @xmath154 ,",
    "the coherence length diverges  @xcite . for @xmath155 a macroscopic population",
    "is concentrated in the single state of lowest energy and an off - diagonal long - range order appears in the real - space one - body density matrix .",
    "this is the so - called penrose - onsager criterion for bose - einstein condensation  @xcite .    also from the experimental point of view",
    "there is a close relation between experiments like the ones in ref .",
    "which measure the coherence of the light emission , and experiments which address the coherence of the atomic matter waves .",
    "the first - order coherence of the matter wave of an atomic bec has in fact been revealed by looking at the interference fringes formed by two atomic wavepackets extracted at different spatial positions  @xcite , while the density fluctuations ( quantified by @xmath156 ) have been measured from the interaction energy  @xcite and the three - body recombination rate  @xcite : both of them are quenched as @xmath157 is lowered below @xmath152 .",
    "although the analogy is very close , it is important to stress the fundamental differences between the bose - einstein condensation phenomenon of equilibrium statistical mechanics and the appearance of spontaneous coherence in the parametric emission from the present microcavity system .",
    "as polaritons have a finite lifetime , they have to be continuously injected in the system from an external pump , and the stationary state arises as a sort of dynamical equilibrium between the injection and the dissipation . instead of a true thermodynamical equilibrium , we are therefore dealing with the stationary state of a _ driven - dissipative _ system  @xcite . hence , there is no reason for the critical properties to be the same , and the general theorems of equilibrium statistical mechanics do not necessarily apply .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the parametric instability can be put forward in terms of modulational instability , the initially spatially homogeneous intensity profile becoming unstable with respect to a periodic modulation which breaks the translational symmetry .",
    "behaviours of this kind are well - known in the framework of nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation  @xcite , and have analogies with the transition from the liquid to a cristalline solid state .",
    "the concept of modulational instability has recently played a central role in the understanding of experiments with atomic bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the intensity modulation and its relation with the parametric instability can be understood by looking at the intensity modulation pattern formed by the interference of the pump , the signal and the idler . in @xmath11 space ,",
    "the pump , the signal and the idler are localized around respectively @xmath39 , @xmath121 and @xmath158 and the polariton wavefunction can be written as : @xmath159 where @xmath160 are slowly varying functions as compared to the period @xmath161 of the intensity modulation . as a shift of the signal and idler phases by @xmath162 corresponds to a spatial translation of the intensity modulation pattern by @xmath163 along the direction of @xmath164 , the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath149 symmetry corresponding to the signal and idler phases",
    "can also be interpreted as the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry along the direction of @xmath165 . as",

    "experimentally , @xmath134 can be measured by simply isolating in the near - field the light emitted from a pair of points @xmath168 and @xmath169 spaced of @xmath2 and then correlating the corresponding intensity fluctuations . as the intensity pattern arises from the interference of signal , pump and idler modes , no preliminar angular selection must now be performed and , for this reason , the symbol @xmath134 does not carry a bar over it .    a detailed study of the appearance of the fringes , effect which in quantum optics goes under the name of _ quantum images _",
    "@xcite , was given in ref .",
    "for the simple case of an optical parametric oscillator formed by a @xmath0 medium in a planar cavity . here",
    "we want to emphasize the relation between the phase coherence properties of the signal / idler emission , quantified by @xmath170 defined in ( [ eq : g1bar ] ) and the coherence length of the periodic modulation of @xmath134 . as a shift of the signal and idler phases by @xmath162 corresponds to a spatial translation displacement of the intensity pattern , a spatial rigidity of the phase of @xmath171 transfers into a corresponding rigidity of the intensity modulation pattern . on the other hand , when the phase of @xmath171 is able to freely fluctuate in space , the intensity modulation pattern is washed out .",
    "this can be observed in the figs.[fig : g2x_below ] and [ fig : g2x_above ] which show @xmath134 for the two cases respectively below and above the threshold : in the first case , the spatial extension of the modulation pattern is finite and equal to the phase coherence length @xmath120 , while in the second case the pattern extends over the whole system . a related interference effect has been used in ref . to infer the coherence length of an atomic bose - einstein condensate from a measurement of intensity correlations .    in ref .",
    ", the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in a planar optical parametric oscillator was pointed out as a slowing down of the diffusive motion of the modulation pattern during the time evolution of a single realization . here",
    "we show another interesting consequence of the same phenomenon in the intensity profile of a single realization of the wigner - monte carlo , that is in an instantanous measurement of the local intensity .",
    "while below threshold the modulation pattern is too weak to be detected on a single realisation and has to be obtained by taking the average over many realisations , it appears clearly although somewhat noisy in a picture taken above threshold when the occupation of the signal and idler modes is large and coherent ( fig.[fig : e_x_single ] ) . obviously , the position of the pattern is random and varies from one realisation to the next .",
    "of a single realization for pump frequencies @xmath114 ( upper panel ) and @xmath166 ( lower panel ) respectively below and above the mean - field threshold .",
    "the cavity and the other pump parameters are the same as in fig.[fig : bogo ] , exception made for the coupling constant @xmath172 and the driving intensity @xmath41 respectively increased and decreased by a factor @xmath173 so as to clarify the picture without affecting the mean - field physics .",
    "[ fig : e_x_single],width=240 ]",
    "all the physical discussions presented in the previous sections were based on a mean - field picture : below threshold , many modes are incoherently populated , while above threshold , there is a macroscopic occupation of a single signal / idler pair of mode and fluctuations give only a small correction .",
    "this interpretation was validated by the numerical results of the complete wigner - monte carlo simulations which were performed for two - dimensional systems of side @xmath106 : above the threshold , coherence of the signal emission extended over the whole two - dimensional sample giving a sort of non - equilibrium long - range order .     of the selected signal emission for pump frequencies",

    "the cavity and the other pump parameters are the same as in fig.[fig : bogo ] , exception made for the geometry : the system is here one - dimensional and @xmath175 .",
    "[ fig : quasibec],width=316 ]    it is a well - known fact of equilibrium statistical mechanics that the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath149 symmetry and the appearance of a long - range order is possible only in dimension @xmath176 at finite temperature and in @xmath177 at zero temperature ( mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite ) , while otherwise coherence extends over a finite distance only . in order to investigate the possibility of observing such behaviours in a non - equilibrium context , we have performed wigner - monte carlo simulations for a system with the same pump parameters as in the previous sections , but in a completely different cavity geometry . instead of a square of size @xmath106",
    ", we consider here a one - dimensional system of length @xmath175 . along this axial direction , the polaritons are free and periodic boundary conditions are assumed , while the transverse motion is assumed to be frozen in the lowest state by a strong lateral confinement .",
    "this kind of reduced - dimensionality systems are well within the possibilities of actual semiconductor technology : effectively one - dimensional systems has been recently demonstrated by several groups  @xcite .    the results of numerical calculations for the first- and second - order coherence of the signal emission are shown in fig.[fig : quasibec ] : below the threshold , the behaviour is similar to the one already observed in the two - dimensional case ( figs.[fig : g1bar_below ] and [ fig : g2bar_below ] ) : the phase coherence extends over a finite distance and intensity fluctuations due to the hanbury - brown and twiss bunching effect are important @xmath178 .    above the threshold , the intensity fluctuations are strongly suppressed @xmath179 as in the two - dimensional case of fig.[fig : g12bar_above ] , while the phase coherence of the signal extends over a longer but still finite distance .",
    "the large distance limit of @xmath180 is in fact @xmath119 and no long - range coherence exists .",
    "similar results were discussed in @xcite for the case of a roll - pattern instability in an optical cavity .    in the language of equilibrium statistical mechanics , phenomena of this kind",
    "are well - known and usually go under the name of _ quasi - condensates _",
    "@xcite , so to stress the fact that a local order is present ( signalled by the reduced value of the intensity fluctuations ) , but not the global one which characterizes a true bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the long range order is in fact destroyed by the long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter , in our case the local phase of the signal emission .    a final remark : recently , the realization of a bec of polaritons was claimed in ref . starting from the observation of a reduced value of @xmath122 .",
    "unless a detailed analysis of the geometry of the system is performed , this observation does not appear as being a conclusive proof of polariton bec , as the mere reduction of intensity fluctuations does not univocally correspond to the presence of a long - range order .",
    "in other terms , the possibility of having a quasi - condensate of polaritons has not been ruled out by the available experimental data .",
    "in the present paper we have presented a comprehensive study of the coherence properties of the parametric emission from a planar semiconductor microcavity for pump parameters spanning across the threshold for the parametric oscillation .",

    "the numerical results are physically understood in terms of a non - equilibrium phase transition occurring at the parametric threshold , a phase transition which closely ressembles to a non - equilibrium bose - einstein condensation .    below threshold ,",
    "the emission is an incoherent one , and the first- and second - order correlation functions show a finite coherence length for both the phase correlation and the intensity fluctuations . as the pump approaches the threshold , the coherence length becomes larger and larger and eventually becomes macroscopic at the threshold . in momentum space",
    ", this corresponds to a broad momentum distribution which gets narrowed into a delta - like peak at the threshold .    above threshold ,",
    "the emission is instead a coherent one , both the signal and the idler intensities becoming of the same order as the pump one , and the corresponding momentum distribution being sharply peaked . for two - dimensional systems of size comparable to the one of actual experiments with planar microcavities",
    ", first- and second - order coherence extends in the whole system . for systems of reduced dimensionality such as photon wires ,",
    "the numerical results suggest that a local order persists in the sense that intensity fluctuations are strongly reduced , but no true long - range order is present , as the global phase coherence is destroyed by long - wavelength phase fluctuations .",
    "this phenomenon is a non - equilibrium analog of the so - called quasi - condensation phenomenon of reduced - dimensionality bose gases at equilibrium .",
    "although the results of the present paper have been obtained for a very specific system of actual experimental interest , we expect the main properties of the critical point at the threshold to be very general for a whole class of non - equilibrium systems .",
    "also the absence of long - range order in low - dimensional systems is expected to be a general fact in non - equilibrium systems : inspired by the mermin - wagner theorem of equilibrium statistical mechanics , we are actually trying to characterize the possibility of a long - range order in non - equilibrium systems of reduced dimensionality , and to determine the corresponding phase coherence length . in order to have a closer comparison with experiments , the effect of a disorder ( which can be straightforwardly taken into account via the potentials @xmath19 in eq.[eq : hamilt_tot ] ) on the non - equilibrium critical properties will be adressed as well .    continuous stimulating discussions with a. baas , o. el daf , j. tignon , g. dasbach , c. diederichs , a. verger , y. castin , c. lobo , a. sinatra , c. tozzo , f. dalfovo , v. savona , and a. rosso are warmly acknowledged .",
