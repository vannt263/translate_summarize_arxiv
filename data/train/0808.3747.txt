    "delay tolerant ad - hoc networks make use of nodes mobility to compensate for lack of instantaneous connectivity .",
    "information sent by a source to a disconnected destination can be forwarded and relayed by other mobile nodes .",
    "there has been a growing interest in such networks as they have the potential of providing many popular distributed services @xcite .",
    "a naive approach to forward a file to the destination is by epidemic routing in which any mobile that has the message keeps on relaying it to any other mobile that falls within its radio range .",
    "this would minimize the delivery delay at the cost of inefficient use of network resources ( e.g. in terms of the energy used for flooding the network ) .",
    "the need for more efficient use of network resources motivated the use of less costly forwarding schemes such as the two - hops routing protocols . in two - hops routing the source transmits copies of its message to all mobiles it encounters ; relays transmit the message only if they come in contact with the destination .",
    "the two - hops protocol was originally introduced in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider another aspect , i.e , the tradeoff between network resources and delay .",
    "we assume that the file to be transferred needs to be split into @xmath0 smaller units : this happens due to the finite duration of contacts between mobile nodes or when the file is large with respect to the buffering capabilities of nodes .",
    "such @xmath0 smaller units ( which we call chunks or frames ) need to be forwarded independently of the others .",
    "the message is considered to be well received only if all @xmath0 frames are received at the destination .    after fragmenting the message into smaller frames , it is convenient to better organize the way information is stored in the relay nodes .",
    "we aim at improving the efficiency of the dtn s operation by letting the source distribute not only the original frames but also additional redundant packets .",
    "this results in a spatial coding of the distributed storage of the frames .",
    "we consider coding based on either forward error correction techniques or on network coding approaches .",
    "our main contribution is to provide a close form expression for the performance of dtns ( in terms of transfer delay and energy consumption ) as a function of the coding that is used .",
    "also , we derive scaling laws for the success probability of message delivery .",

    "we considered two sets of experimental contact traces :    _ haggle _ : in @xcite and related works , the authors report extensive experimentation conducted in order to trace the meeting pattern of mobile users .",
    "a version of imotes , equipped with a bluetooth radio interface , was distributed to a number of people , each device collecting the time epoch of meetings with other bluetooth devices . in the case of haggle traces , due to the presence of several spurious contacts with erratic bluetooth devices",
    ", we restricted the contacts to a subset having experienced at least @xmath200 contacts , resulting in @xmath201 active nodes .",
    "_ cn _ : the cn dataset has been obtained by monitoring @xmath202 employee within create - net and working on different floors of the same building during a @xmath203-week period .",
    "employees volunteered to carry a mobile running a java application relying on bluetooth connectivity .",
    "the application periodically triggers ( every @xmath204 seconds ) a bluetooth node discovery ; detected nodes are recorded via their bluetooth address , together with the current timestamp on the device storage for a later processing .    fig  [ fig : fig4 ] a ) and b ) depict the results of experiments performed with these data sets .",
    "a major impact is played by the non - stationarity of traces .",
    "this is mainly due to `` holes '' appearing in the trace which impose unavoidable cutoff effects on the success probability . in particular , in the case of fountain coding , for @xmath205 , i.e. , when the original file is actually fragmented , the performance is rather poor .",
    "this is due to the increase with @xmath0 of the number of frames @xmath138 required for decoding , exacerbated by the reduced size of the network .",
    "for example , for @xmath206 and @xmath207 it holds @xmath208 , i.e. @xmath138 is close to @xmath123 for the haggle trace and larger than @xmath209 for the cn trace ; this means that , in order to deliver the message , basically almost all nodes should meet the destination and deliver a frame within @xmath3 .    with erasure codes ,",
    "both traces show the characteristic cutoff of performances at the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "the decay , though , depends on the trace considered ; in particular , a close look to the two data sets showed that the haggle trace has higher average inter - meeting intensity compared to the cn trace over the considered interval ; the shape seen in fig  [ fig : fig4]a ) resembles more closely the theoretical sigmoid cutoff predicted by the model .",
    "( -315,110)a)(-142,110)b )",
    "we have considered in this paper the tradeoff between energy and probability of successful delivery in presence of finite duration of contacts or limited storage capacity at a node : it can store only part ( a frame ) of a file that is to be transferred . to improve performance we considered the generation of erasure codes at the source which allows the dtn to gain in spatial storage diversity . both fixed erasure codes ( reed solomon type codes ) as well as rateless fountain codes",
    "have been studied .",
    "fountain codes can be viewed as special case of general network coding such as those studied in @xcite .",
    "we note however that in order to go beyond fountain codes ( in which coding is done at the source ) and consider general network coding ( where coding is also done in the relay nodes ) , one needs not only change the coding approach but one should allow storage of several frames at each relay node .",
    "also , interesting hints come from the presence of non - stationary patterns arising in real world traces . new tradeoff issues arise which we shall study in future work .",
