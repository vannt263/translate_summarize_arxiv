    "this session of the workshop is devoted to the study of the `` sigma '' particle , which is related to the large @xmath8-wave @xmath9 scattering amplitude ; it peaks around 800 mev and again near 1300 mev .",
    "the nature of this s wave enhancement was under discussion since the very beginning of @xmath9 interaction studies and the interpretation is still developing .",
    "its role in s - matrix and regge theory , chiral theories and @xmath10 spectroscopy is considered since ; after the advent of qcd the possibility of glueball spectroscopy@xcite has opened up as well which is in the focus of our attention . in order to obtain the proper interpretation of the `` sigma ''",
    ", a classification of all low lying @xmath0 states into the @xmath10 nonet and glueball states appears necessary . to this end",
    "we first discuss the evidence for the low mass scalar states ( @xmath11 1600 mev ) and then proceed with an attempt of their classification as quarkonium or glueball states from their properties in production and decay .",
    "we will argue that the `` sigma '' is actually the lightest glueball .",
    "the main arguments for our classifications will be presented , further details of this study can be found in the recent publication.@xcite",
    "the particle data group@xcite lists the following @xmath12 scalar states : @xmath6 which is related to the `` sigma '' , @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 , not all being firmly established .",
    "the existence of a resonance is not only signaled by a peak in the mass spectrum but it requires in addition that the scattering amplitude moves along a full circle in the complex plane ( `` argand diagram '' ) .",
    "the first two states have been studied in detail in the phase shift analysis of elastic @xmath13 scattering . as discussed by k. rybicki@xcite , the results from high statistics experiments with unpolarized@xcite and",
    "polarized target@xcite have led to an almost unique solution up to 1400 mev out of the total of four . on the other hand , recent data on the @xmath14 final state from gams@xcite",
    "show a different behaviour of the s - d wave phase differences above 1200 mev .",
    "a complete phase shift analysis would provide an important consistency check with the previous @xmath13 results .",
    "another experiment on @xmath14 pair production is in progress ( bnl  e852@xcite ) , the preliminary mass spectrum is shown in fig.1a .",
    "one can see a broad spectrum with two or three peaks ( which we refer to as the `` red dragon '' ) .",
    "there is no question about the existence of @xmath1 which causes the first dip near 1 gev by its interference with the smooth `` background '' .",
    "more controversial is the interpretation of the second peak which appears in the region 1200 - 1400 mev in different experiments .",
    "if we remove the @xmath1 from a global resonance fit of the spectrum the remaining amplitude phase shift moves slowly through @xmath15 near 1000 mev and continues rising up to 1400 mev where it has largely completed a full resonance circle ( see also@xcite ) . a local breit - wigner approximation to these phase shifts",
    "yields @xmath16 in this interpretation the second peak does not correspond to a second resonance ",
    "@xmath7  but is another signal from the broad object . a second resonance would require a second circle which is not seen.@xcite therefore , a complete phase shift analysis of the @xmath14 data in terms of resonances is important for consolidation .",
    "we also investigated whether the state @xmath7 , instead , appears with sizable coupling in the inelastic channels @xmath17 where peaks in the considered mass region occur as well , although not all at the same position , see fig.1b , c . to this end",
    "we constructed the argand diagrams for these channels in fig.2 .",
    "a similar result for @xmath18 has been found already from earlier data.@xcite    the movement of the amplitudes in the complex plane ( fig.2 ) can be interpreted in terms of a superposition of a resonance and a slowly varying background .",
    "we identify the circles with the @xmath2 state which has been studied in great detail by crystal barrel.@xcite this resonance can be seen to interfere with opposite sign in the two channels in figs.2a , b with the background and this also explains the shift of the peak positions in fig.1b , c .",
    "thus , the structures in the 1300 mev region do not correspond to additional circles , therefore no additional breit - wigner resonance @xmath7 is associated with the respective peaks .",
    "as members of the nonet we take the two isoscalars @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are mixtures of flavor singlet and octet states .",
    "furthermore we include the isovector @xmath19 and the strange @xmath20 .",
    "then the only scalar states with mass below @xmath21 1600 mev left out up to now are the broad `` sigma '' to which we come back later and the @xmath22 , which could be a radially excited state .",
    "we find the mixing of the @xmath23 states like the one of the pseudoscalars , namely , with flavour amplitudes @xmath24 , approximately as @xmath25 we have been lead to this classification and mixing by a number of observations :    _ 1 .",
    "@xmath26 decays _ + the branching ratios of @xmath27 into @xmath28 and @xmath29 are of similar size and about twice as large as @xmath30 and @xmath31 which is reproduced by the above flavor composition .",
    "_ 2 . gell - mann - okubo mass formula _ + this formula predicts the mass of the octet member @xmath32 . with our octet members @xmath33 and @xmath34 as input one finds @xmath35 mev , or , with the @xmath5-@xmath36 type mixing included @xmath37 mev .",
    "the small deviation of @xmath2110% in @xmath38 from the mass of the @xmath2 is tolerable and can be attributed to strange quark mass effects .",
    "two body decays of scalars _",
    "+ given the flavor composition eq.([mixing ] ) we can derive the decay amplitudes into pairs of pseudoscalars whereby we allow for a @xmath39 relative amplitude @xmath8 ( for a similar analysis , see@xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the branching ratios @xmath40 are found in satisfactory agreement with the data for values @xmath8 around 0.5 .",
    "relative signs of decay amplitudes _ + a striking prediction is the relative sign of the decay amplitudes of the @xmath2 into pairs of pseudoscalars : because of the negative sign in the @xmath39 component , see eq.([mixing ] ) , the sign of the @xmath18 decay amplitude is negative with respect to @xmath41 decay and also to the respective @xmath42 and glueball decay amplitudes .",
    "this prediction is indeed confirmed by the amplitudes in fig.2a , b which show circles pointing in upward and downward directions , respectively .",
    "if @xmath2 were a glueball , then both circles should have positive sign as in fig.2b , but the experimental results are rather orthogonal to such an expectation .",
    "further tests of our classification are provided by the predictions on the decays @xmath43 and the @xmath44 decay modes of the scalars .",
    "in the previous analysis we have classified the scalar mesons in the pdg tables below 1600 mev with the exception of @xmath6 and also of @xmath7 which we did not accept as standard breit - wigner resonance .",
    "we consider the broad spectrum in fig.1a with its two or three peaks as a single very broad object which interferes with the @xmath23 resonances .",
    "this `` background '' with slowly moving phase appears also in the inelastic channels ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "it is our hypothesis that this very broad object with parameters eq.([sigma ] ) is the lightest glueball .",
    "we do not exclude some mixing with the scalar nonet states but it should be sufficiently small such as to preserve the main characteristics outlined before .",
    "we discuss next , how this glueball assignment fits with phenomenological expectations.@xcite    _ 1 . the large width _ + the unique feature of this state is its large width .",
    "there are two qualitative arguments@xcite why this is natural for a light glueball : + a ) for a heavy glueball one expects a small width as the perturbative analysis involves a small coupling constant @xmath45 at high masses (  gluonic zweig rule@xcite ) . for",
    "a light glueball around 1 gev this argument does nt hold any more and a large @xmath45 could yield a large width .",
    "+ b ) the light @xmath3 states are coupled mainly to pairs of pseudoscalar particles .",
    "then , for a scattering process through a @xmath3 channel the external particles are in an s - wave state ; an intermediate @xmath10 resonance will be in a p - wave state but an intermediate @xmath46 system in an s - wave again . therefore the overlap of wave functions in the glueball case is larger and we expect @xmath47 _ 2 .",
    "reactions favorable for glueball production _ + a ) the `` red dragon '' shows up also in the centrally produced systems in high energy @xmath48 collisions@xcite which are dominated by double pomeron exchange , with new results presented by a. kirk.@xcite because of the gluonic nature of the pomeron , this strong production coincides with the expectations .",
    "+ b ) the broad low mass @xmath9 spectrum is also observed in decays of radially excited states @xmath49 and @xmath50 which are expected to be mediated by gluonic exchanges .",
    "+ c ) the hadrons in the decay @xmath51 are expected to be produced through 2-gluon intermediate states which could form a scalar glueball . however , in the low mass region @xmath52 1 gev only little s - wave in the @xmath9 channel is observed .",
    "_ 3 . flavour properties _",
    "+ the branching ratios of the @xmath7  which we consider as part of the glueball  into @xmath18 and @xmath41 compare favorably with expectations .",
    "_ 4 . suppression in @xmath44 collisions _",
    "+ if the mixing of the glueball with charged particles is small it should be weakly produced in @xmath44 collisions . in the process",
    "@xmath53 there is a dominant peak related to @xmath42 but , in comparison , a very small cross section in the low mass region around 600 mev",
    ". this could be partially due to hadronic rescattering and absorption , partly due to the smallness of the 2 photon coupling of the intermediate states .",
    "unfortunately , the data in the @xmath54 region leave a large uncertainty on the s - wave fraction ( @xmath55%@xcite ) . in a fit to the data which takes into account the one - pion - exchange born terms and @xmath9 rescattering the two photon width of the states @xmath42 and @xmath6 have been determined@xcite as 2.84@xmath560.35 and 3.8@xmath56 1.5 kev , respectively . if the @xmath23 were a light quark state like the @xmath54 we might expect comparable ratios of @xmath44 and @xmath9 decay widths , but we find ( in units of @xmath57 ) @xmath58 thus , for the scalar state , this ratio is 3 - 4 times smaller , and it could be smaller by another factor 3 at about the 2@xmath59 level",
    ". a more precise measurement of the s - wave cross section in the @xmath54 region would be very important for this discussion .    at present , we conclude that the @xmath60 width of the scalar state is indeed surprisingly small . in this model@xcite",
    "an intermediate glueball would couple to photons through the intermediate @xmath13 channel .",
    "quark - antiquark and gluonic components in @xmath9 scattering _ + in the dual regge picture the @xmath61 scattering amplitude is built either from the sequence of s - channel resonances or from the sequence of t - channel regge poles . there is a second component ( `` two component duality''@xcite ) which corresponds to the pomeron in the t - channel and is dual to a `` background '' in the direct s - channel . if the pomeron is related to glueballs , then one should have , by crossing , a third component with a glueball in the direct s - channel , dual to exotic exchange.@xcite    the existence of the `` background '' process can be demonstrated by constructing the amplitudes for definite t - channel isospin @xmath62 .",
    "such an analysis has been carried out by quigg@xcite for @xmath9 scattering and is shown in fig.3 .",
    "similar to what has been found in @xmath63 scattering@xcite there are essentially background - free resonance circles for @xmath64 , but in the @xmath65 amplitude ( pomeron exchange ) the background rises with energy and is sizable already below 1 gev .",
    "we take this result as a further hint that low energy @xmath9 scattering is not dominated by @xmath10 resonances alone .",
    "_ 1 . lattice qcd _ + in the calculation without sea - quarks ( `` quenched approximation '' ) one finds the lightest glueball in the @xmath3 channel at masses 1500 - 1700 mev ( recent review@xcite ) .",
    "these results have motivated various recent searches and scenarios for the lightest glueball .",
    "the identification with the well established @xmath2 state , either with or without mixing with other states , has some phenomenological difficulties , especially the negative amplitude sign into @xmath66 ( fig.2a ) .",
    "some changes of these qcd predictions may occur if the full unquenched calculation is carried out .",
    "the first results by bali et al.@xcite indicate a decrease of the glueball mass with the quark masses ; the latter are still rather large and correspond to @xmath67 mev . for the moment",
    "we conclude that our light glueball hypothesis is not necessarily in conflict with the lattice qcd results .",
    "_ 2 . qcd sum rules _ + the saturation of the sum rules for the @xmath3 glueball was found impossible with a single state near 1500 mev alone in a recent analysis.@xcite rather , the inclusion of a light glueball component was required and assumed to be coupled to states @xmath68 and @xmath69 . already before ,",
    "a sum rule solution with a light glueball @xmath70 mev was proposed.@xcite    _ 3 . bag model _ + in a model which consideres quarks and gluons to be confined in a bag of comparable size and with radiative qcd corrections included,@xcite the lightest glueball was suggested for @xmath3 at around 1 gev mass .",
    "an important precondition for the assignment of glueball states is the understanding of the low mass @xmath10 spectroscopy .",
    "_ 1 . renormalizable linear sigma models _",
    "+ these models realize the spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown and represent an attractive theoretical approach to the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "an example is the approach by trnqvist@xcite which starts from a `` bare '' nonet respecting the ozi rule while the observed hadron spectrum is strongly distorted by unitarization effects .    in an alternative approach,@xcite",
    "one starts from a 3-flavor nambu - jona - lasinio model but includes a renormalizable effective action for the sigma fields with an instanton induced axial @xmath71 symmetry - breaking term along the suggestion by thooft.@xcite in this model @xmath2 is near the octet and the light isoscalar near the singlet state ; different options are pursued@xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath19 , at least one of them should be a non-@xmath10 state .",
    "this suggestion of a large singlet - octet mixing and the classification of the @xmath2 is close to our phenomenological findings in sect.3 .",
    "general effective qcd potential _ + in our approach@xcite we do not restrict ourselves to renormalizable interaction terms . in this way the consequences of chiral symmetry in different limits for the quark masses can be explored in a general qcd framework.@xcite in particular , it is possible to keep both @xmath1 and @xmath19 as @xmath10 states .",
    "their degeneracy in mass can be obtained , although not predicted .",
    "an expansion to first order in the strange quark mass is investigated .",
    "the gell - mann - okubo formula is obtained in this approximation ; with an @xmath5-@xmath4 type mixing the observed states discussed in sect.3 , with @xmath2 as the heaviest member of the nonet near the octet state , can be realized .",
    "we found a classification of the low lying @xmath0 states which explains a large body of experimental and phenomenological results .",
    "the @xmath10 nonet includes @xmath1 and @xmath2 with mixing similar to the pseudoscalars @xmath4 and @xmath5 , furthermore @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; @xmath4 and @xmath1 appear as genuine parity doublet .",
    "the lightest glueball is identified with the broad `` sigma '' corresponding to @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the pdg .",
    "the basic triplet of light binary glueballs is completed@xcite by the states @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 , not discussed here",
    ".    it will be important to further study production and decay of the states under discussion .",
    "some particular questions we came across here include : a ) unique phase shift solution for @xmath9 scattering above 1 gev for both charge modes ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , b ) production of @xmath2 in @xmath27 decays , c ) s - waves in radiative @xmath27 decays and d ) @xmath44 widths of the scalar particles .",
    "it remains an open question in this approach , though , what the physical origin of the @xmath78 mass degeneracy is and where the mirror symmetry of the mass patterns in the scalar and pseudoscalar nonets comes from .",
    "a possible explanation for the latter structure is suggested by a renormalizable model with an instanton induced @xmath79-breaking interaction .",
