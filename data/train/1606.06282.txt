    "decoherence is that interference among different quantum states disappear because of dissipation - fluctuation from environments[1,2 ] .",
    "it is said that decoherence makes a quantum system classical .",
    "because when interference vanishes , an object can not go to other quantum states .",
    "it means the object gets classicality . in quantum mechanics",
    ", an object can be in some contradictory states at the same time .",
    "this fact has made some paradoxes .",
    "now , it is expected that decoherence solves those paradoxes .",
    "for example , `` schrdinger s cat '' , which is a superposition of a dead cat and an alive cat , disappears by decoherence because of environmental effect such as room temperature .",
    "therefore we can not see real schrdinger s cat . on the other hand",
    ", decoherence seems helpless for fantasies such as everett s interpretation ( many - worlds interpretation)[3 ] or multiverse . in principle",
    ", the universe we live in can be in some contradictory states at the same time .",
    "but there is no observer who decides a state of our universe uniquely nor external environment making decoherence for our universe .",
    "so , do we have better lives in the other universe ?",
    "i have studied decoherence in a finite system .",
    "my motivation was the fact that semi - classical models , such as liquid drop model[7 ] or tdhf[8 ] , are not bad theories in nuclear physics .",
    "i wondered the fact .",
    "then i knew caldeira - leggett s theory[5,6 ] .",
    "it is said that the key of decoherence is the external environment which is composed with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "although i was very impressed , i doubted the `` infinite numbers '' . because i thought that nuclear system , which is finite system , is classical to some extent .    in my previous paper[4",
    "] , i have shown that decoherence occurs in a sub - system of an isolated system without any other external environments . in the paper[4 ] , there are only 3 particles , and it is suggested that particle-1 as a sub - system gets classicality because of fluctuations from other 2 particles .",
    "furthermore , it is suggested that while classical trajectories are crossing , decoherences arise in corresponding quantum system .    because my model is symmetric about three particles",
    ", we can confirm that the environmental particles , particle-2 and -3 also get classicality respectively .",
    "then , how are the 3 particles as a whole ?    by this research , it is suggested that a state of a whole system of three particles seems to get classicality too .",
    "that is , this system s wavefunction collapses spontaneously without any external environments .",
    "this result seems to break unitarity of this whole system of three particles .",
    "please imagine a closed system , there three particles are mutually tied with springs which have different angular frequencies respectively .",
    "lagrangean @xmath0 is as follow .",
    "( @xmath1 means position of particle-1 , etc . )",
    "@xmath2 here , there are three angular frequencies , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "when they do not have the ratio of whole number , their trajectories are not closed , and densely fill some finite region . there , since it is thought that ergodicity is fulfilled locally , it can be expected that statistical property and also irreversibility appear . if irreversibility induces decoherence , decoherence should arise by such a system . for this model",
    ", i will apply the technique of caldeira - leggett .",
    "this three particles model is a extreme reduction of their  harmonic oscillator plus reservoir model[5,6 ] .",

    ", we can write a time evolution of wave function of three body system .    initial wave function of the three body system is the product of wave functions of each particles at initial time @xmath7 . and the each initial state is schrdinger cat state , @xmath8 \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{e3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] etc .. here , @xmath9 means @xmath10 , @xmath11 means half width of packet and @xmath12 means a normalization constant .",
    "when we are only interested in the information about a degree of freedom ( particle-1 ) as a subsystem , we should integrate out the information about particle-2 and -3 as environments .",
    "then we can get the information about particle-1 only , that is , the reduced density function for particle-1 , @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14    furthermore , we can separate the quantum interference term from the reduced density , and a disappearance of the interference means decoherence .",
    "i used numerical integration in eq.([e4 ] ) and final normalization .",
    "if you interested in details , please watch appendix .",
    "we can get the reduced density function for particle-2 and particle-3 respectively with same ways .",
    "therefore we can also check decoherence for particle-2 and particle-3 .",
    "this procedure above is basically the same as caldeira - leggett s technique[5,6 ] .",
    "they used an influence functional method in which a feynman propagator includes effects of environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "the difference between my procedure here and theirs is only an order of integrals and path integrals .",
    "on the other hand , we can draw corresponding classical trajectories @xmath15 .",
    "each particle has 2 initial positions which are corresponding to centers of two gaussian packets in quantum system , and their all initial velocities are set 0",
    ". then we can draw @xmath16 trajectories on a ( @xmath17-t ) plane ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "while classical trajectories are crossing , decoherences arise in corresponding quantum system[4 ] .",
