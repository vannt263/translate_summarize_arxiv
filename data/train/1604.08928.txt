    "we consider a magnetized quantum plasma consisting of degenerate electrons as well as positron fluids in presence of an uniform external magnetic field acting along the @xmath3-axis , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the qmhd model ( which can be obtained from the self - consistent hartree equations @xcite or from the phase - space wigner - poisson equations @xcite ) describing the dynamical behaviors of electrons and positrons is given by @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , denote the number density , velocity and charge of @xmath10-species particle , and @xmath11 is the mass of electrons @xmath12 and positrons @xmath13 . also , @xmath14 is the electric ( magnetic ) field and @xmath15 is the permittivity of free space .",
    "the equations - are closed by the maxwell s equations , to be presented shortly .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 is the weakly relativistic pressure for degenerate electrons and positrons given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fermi velocity with @xmath19 denoting the boltzmann constant , @xmath20 the fermi temperature and @xmath21 the equilibrium number density of electrons and positrons .",
    "the particle dispersion associated with the density correlation due to quantum fluctuation ( tunneling ) is included in eq . via the bohm potential @xmath22 given by @xcite @xmath23 furthermore , in dense plasmas",
    "the electron / positron exchange / correlation effects play a non - negligible role @xcite .",
    "the general framework that produces such exchange - correlation potentials is the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "this potential is a complicated function of the particle number density given by @xcite @xmath24 , \\label{exchange - corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the effective dielectric constant of the medium and @xmath26 is the bohr radius .",
    "next , linearizing the set of equations and by splitting up the physical quantities into their equilibrium ( with a zero value or a quantity with suffix @xmath27 ) and perturbation parts ( with suffix @xmath28 ) , i.e. , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we obtain ( after omitting the suffix @xmath28 ) @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the coefficient of the term associated with the bohm potential and @xmath36 , \\label{alpha - ex - corr}\\ ] ] in which the first term in the square brackets appears due to the weakly relativistic degenerate pressure of electrons and positrons , and the second term @xmath37 is due to the exchange and correlation effects . here",
    ", @xmath38 is the dimensionless quantum parameter measuring the ratio of the electron / positron plasmon energy to the fermi energy densities .",
    "note that for high - density plasmas , @xmath39 , and so the expression can be further simplified as @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{alpha - ex - corr - approx}\\ ] ] the perturbed electromagnetic fields are governed by the maxwell s equations @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the current density . in what follows , we consider an elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave propagating along the @xmath44-axis .",
    "we suppose that the polarized electric field lies in @xmath45-plane , i.e. , @xmath46 , and as before the external magnetic field is along the @xmath3-axis , i.e. , @xmath4 . assuming the variation of the perturbed quantities to be of the form @xmath47 with @xmath48 denoting the wave number ( frequency ) of perturbations , we obtain from eqs .",
    "and the following equations @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 with @xmath52 denoting the fermi debye length . using eq . and separating the @xmath44- and @xmath53-components of eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath54 @xmath55 where the upper and lower signs in @xmath56 or @xmath57 refer to the signs of charges of electrons and positrons respectively .",
    "next , from eqs .",
    "and we obtain @xmath58 @xmath59 from eqs . and",
    "solving for @xmath60 and @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62 @xmath63",
    "substituting the expressions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 from eqs . and into eqs . and",
    ", we obtain for nonzero values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 the following dispersion relations for the quantum modified x - wave and the upper - hybrid wave @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the upper - hybrid oscillation frequency in classical plasmas . by disregarding the quantum effects @xmath69",
    ", one can obtain from eq . the dispersion relation for x - em waves in electron - positron plasmas as @xmath70 and from eq .",
    "the usual hybrid frequency @xmath71 . also , by neglecting the quantum effects and the positron dynamics , and assuming positive ions to form the background plasma , one can obtain the known classical results for the x - wave as @xcite @xmath72 now , comparing eq . with eq .",
    ", we find that the dispersion of the x - em wave in ep plasmas is greatly modified by the quantum effects @xmath69 . here , in eq .",
    ", the factor @xmath73 appears due to pair plasmas with equal mass and unperturbed number density .",
    "also , after substitutions of the solutions and into eqs . and , we note that ( because of pair plasmas ) the corresponding terms @xmath74 and @xmath64 in these equations cancel each other . as a result",
    "the term @xmath75 disappears from both the numerator and denominator of the term in the parentheses in eq . .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion equation , upon dropping the positron dynamics ( hence the corresponding factor and the terms as above ) and the contribution from the exchange correlation force , agrees with that in ref . except the spin magnetization current which has not been considered in the present model .    in",
    "what follows , we recast eq . into its dimensionless form as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    ", the influence of the quantum effects is mediated through the terms proportional to @xmath79 both in the numerator and denominator . here",
    ", we recall that the first term in @xmath79 appears due to the degeneracy pressure of electrons and positrons , the second term is due to the exchange - correlation force and the third term is for the particle dispersion associated with the bohm potential . furthermore , both the exchange correlation and the particle dispersive effects scale as @xmath80 .",
    "thus , it follows that in the long - wavelength ep plasma oscillations with @xmath81 , the quantum dispersive effects can be negligible compared to the contribution from the exchange - correlation force @xcite .",
    "however , for short - wavelength oscillations @xmath82 , the effects can be reverse , i.e. , the particle dispersion may be comparable to or even dominate over the exchange - correlation force . however , for long - wavelength ep plasma oscillations in dense environments where @xmath83 , the degeneracy pressure may play a dominating role over the exchange - correlation force as well as the particle dispersion . in the next sections we will analyze these effects numerically on the wave dispersion as well on the phase and group velocities of the x wave .",
    "equation , while expressed in @xmath84 , gives two modes of the x - wave @xmath85 , \\label{x1-x2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 and @xmath87 , to be shown as the square of the resonance frequency shortly .",
    "the expressions for the phase velocity @xmath88 and the group velocity @xmath89 can be obtained from the dispersion relation by a straightforward algebra as @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "note that corresponding to two different x - wave modes given by eq . , and using eqs .",
    "and one can obtain different expressions for the phase velocity and group velocity . in sec .",
    "[ sec - results - discuss ] we will see that while the group velocity of the branch @xmath94 increases with @xmath95 , the upper branch @xmath96 approaches a constant value for @xmath95 .",
    "the dispersion relation of the x - wave is somewhat complicated .",
    "however , to analyze its properties it is useful to obtain the cutoff and resonance frequencies .",
    "such cutoffs occur when the index of refraction @xmath97 goes to zero or when the wavelength becomes infinite . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonance of the x - wave occurs when the index of refraction becomes infinite or the wavelength becomes zero .",
    "the x - wave will then be reflected at the cutoff frequency and absorbed at the resonance .",
    "thus , from eq . the cutoff frequencies can be obtained as @xmath98 , \\label{cutoff - r - l}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the quantum modified hybrid frequency , and the suffices @xmath100 and @xmath101 , corresponding to the plus and minus sign , respectively , stand for the right- and left - hand cutoff frequencies of the x - wave modified by the quantum effects .",
    "note that in absence of the quantum effects , while the left - hand cutoff occurs at a zero value , the right - hand cutoff occurs at the upper - hybrid frequency .",
    "the resonance frequency is obtained from eq .",
    "as @xmath102 thus , the resonance frequency of the x - em wave is also modified by the quantum effects , in absence of which the resonance occurs at the cyclotron frequency instead of the upper - hybrid frequency as in classical x - em waves @xcite .",
    "we numerically investigate the dispersion properties of the x - wave [ eq . ] through the behaviors of the cutoff and resonance frequencies given by eqs . and .",
    "the latter are important in part as they define the pass and stop bands where the x - em waves can propagate in ep plasmas .",
    "these are illustrated in fig .",
    "it clearly shows that the x waves ( solid lines except that represents @xmath103 ) can propagate in the pass band regions of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , however , a stop band exists in the range @xmath106 .",
    "the cutoffs ( dashed lines ) are at the frequencies where the dispersion relation vanishes into the refractive index @xmath107 , and the resonances ( dotted line ) are where @xmath108 .",
    "we also note that while for the upper pass band @xmath109 , the lower branch of the x - wave propagates with a phase velocity @xmath110 smaller than the speed of light in vacuum @xmath111 . furthermore , because of the quantum effects , namely the degeneracy pressure , the exchange - correlation and the particle dispersion , the upper - hybrid frequency , and the cutoff and resonance frequencies are no longer constants but are dispersive and increase with the wave number @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , it is also seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that in contrast to classical em wave , the group velocities of the x waves do not tend to vanish in the vicinity of the upper - hybrid frequency .        the properties of the group velocities of the two branches of the x wave are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for different values of the quantum parameter @xmath113 and the cyclotron frequency @xmath114 .",
    "it is seen that while the parameter @xmath113 does not have any influence on the upper branch @xmath96 [ see the right panel ( b ) ] , it can reduce the group velocity of the lower branch @xmath94 in the range @xmath115 and increase in the other regime [ see the left panel ( a ) ] .",
    "also , @xmath116 of the branch @xmath96 approaches a constant value , whereas that of @xmath94 keeps increasing with @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the cyclotron frequency on @xmath116 of @xmath94 is to increase its value in the regime of @xmath117 and decrease in @xmath118 .",
    "however , increasing values of the same @xmath119 decreases the values of @xmath116 of @xmath96 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] clearly shows how the quantum parameter @xmath113 and the the cyclotron frequency @xmath114 greatly influence the characteristics of the lower / upper branches as well as the cutoff frequencies of the x - em wave .",
    "it is seen that the values of @xmath96 remain unchanged with @xmath113 , whereas the other frequencies get significantly modified by this parameter .",
    "note that in most the cases , except for @xmath120 , the effect of @xmath114 is to increase the frequencies .",
    "it is also seen that @xmath120 approaches a constant value at large @xmath112 and the effects of @xmath114 on the frequencies become significant in the regime of @xmath121 . it is also found that the behaviors of the lower branch @xmath94 of the x - wave are almost similar to those of the right - hand cutoff frequency @xmath122 [ see panels ( a ) and ( d ) ] .        to investigate the influence of different quantum forces",
    "separately and as illustrations we have plotted @xmath120 and @xmath94 ( here , we recall that @xmath94 has similar behaviors as of @xmath122 and the quantum parameter @xmath113 does not have any significant effect on @xmath96 ) with @xmath112 as in fig .",
    "it is shown that for the left - hand cutoffs the correlation effect can be negligible for higher values of @xmath112 or for short - wavelength oscillations @xmath82 , however , its effect is no longer negligible for moderate values of @xmath112 or as @xmath121 ( see the solid and dashed lines ) . for the right - hand cutoff or the lower branch of the x - wave ,",
    "the effect of the correlation force is significant in the range @xmath95 . in both the panels ( a ) and ( b ) it is also seen that the particle dispersion dominates over the correlation force and the degeneracy pressure in the range @xmath95 .",
    "we have investigated the dispersion properties of the x - em waves in a magnetized degenerate ep - pair plasma with the effects of weakly relativistic degeneracy pressure , the quantum force associated with the bohm potential and that due to exchange and correlations of electrons and positrons .",
    "it is shown that the latter two effects , which scale as @xmath113 ( the ratio of plasmon energy to the fermi energy densities ) along with the degeneracy pressure significantly modify the refractive index of the x - wave .",
    "it is also seen that while the particle dispersion becomes important for short - wavelength oscillations , the exchange correlation can no longer be negligible ( or can even dominate over the other quantum effects ) in the long - wavelength perturbations .",
    "the upper - hybrid frequency together with the cutoff and resonance frequencies are also shown to be dispersive as modified by the quantum effects .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the classical x - em waves , the group velocity is shown to be non - vanishing in the vicinity of the upper - hybrid frequency . to conclude , the results should be useful for understanding the dispersion properties of x - em waves that can propagate in magnetized dense ep - pair plasmas such as those in magnetized white dwarf stars , neutron stars etc .",
