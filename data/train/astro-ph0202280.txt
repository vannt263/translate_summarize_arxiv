    "nonthermal synchrotron emission is radiated by electrons accelerated via first - order shock fermi processes to lorentz factors @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the comoving magnetic field .",
    "these electrons will compton - scatter all available radiation fields , including the internal synchrotron field and the external radiation fields intercepted by the jet .",
    "the intensities of the external ambient radiation fields , transformed to the comoving jet frame , are generally required to model the production spectra of blazars .",
    "external photon fields include the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) field ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter ds93 ) , the accretion - disk radiation field ( @xcite , ds93 ) , the accretion - disk radiation field scattered by surrounding gas and dust @xcite , infrared emissions from hot dust or a molecular torus @xcite , reflected synchrotron radiation @xcite , broad - line region atomic line radiation @xcite , etc .",
    "gamma rays in leptonic models of broadband blazar emission originate from synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) @xcite or external compton ( ec ) ( e.g. , @xcite , ds93 , @xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) processes .",
    "in hadronic models , secondary photopairs and photomesons are produced when energetic protons and ions interact with ambient synchrotron photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) and photons of the external field @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of a blazar will consist , in addition to nonthermal synchrotron and ssc emissions , of secondary radiations that are a consequence of processes involving external soft photon fields .",
    "these radiations include neutral secondaries from hadrons , and the radiations produced when external soft photon fields are scattered by directly accelerated lepton primaries and lepton secondaries formed in photopair , photohadronic , and electromagnetic cascade processes .",
    "the intensities of the various components depend on the properties of the external fields , the properties of the relativistic outflows , and the time - dependent spectral injection of ions and electrons into the outflow . given these conditions , the evolving particle and photon distributions and emergent radiation spectra",
    "can be derived for a specific model .",
    "a significant modeling effort has been devoted to blazar studies . where the synchrotron and ssc components are the dominant radiation processes , as appears to be the case in some x - ray bright bl lac objects such as mrk 421 and mrk 501 , observations of correlated x - ray / tev loop patterns found in graphs of spectral index versus intensity are explained through combined particle acceleration , injection , and radiative loss effects @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of bl lac objects are successfully modelled with synchrotron and ssc components from broken power - law electron distributions with low energy cutoffs , as in mrk 501 @xcite .",
    "models for the spectral energy distributions of flat spectrum quasars , including external compton components , have been presented for different spectral states by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and in papers cited in the first paragraph .",
    "more recently , @xcite have presented a model for blazar variability with time - dependent injection into a relativistically moving blob that contains nonthermal electrons which are subject to radiative and adiabatic losses .",
    "the scattered radiation from an external , quasi - isotropic radiation field is treated , and evolving spectral energy distributions and light curves are calculated .",
    "no direct accretion disk field is however treated , though the emission sites could be within 0.1 - 1 pc of the black hole , where such components can make a significant contribution @xcite .",
    "we show that the addition of the accretion - disk components produce light curves and correlated multifrequency behaviors that are quite distinct from the behavior calculated by @xcite .",

    "we adopt a formulation in terms of intensity rather than , as in ds93 , photon number .",
    "the intensity formulation seems to offer a simpler method for comparing multiwavelength data , though the photon number approach perhaps simplifies the formulation of the scattering , attenuation , and secondary production interactions .",
    "the jet plasma is assumed to be located along the symmetry axis of a geometrically - thin accretion disk .",
    "the intensity of photons in the jet frame depends on whether the accretion disk is optically thick or thin at large disk radii @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance of the jet plasma from the black hole .",
    "the treatment of ds93 used an optically - thin formulation with a volume - energy generation rate appropriate to disk accretion in a steady flow .",

    "the radiation fields originating from radii @xmath4 , though spectrally distinct between the optically - thin and -thick cases , give minor effect on the thomson energy losses and scattered photon spectra .",
    "the energy density of disk photons that are scattered to @xmath5-ray energies by the jet electrons is shown to be dominated by photon production at @xmath6 in the near - field ( nf ) regime , and by the total black - hole power approximated as a receding point source in the far - field ( ff ) regime .",
    "the accretion - disk photons scattered by gas and dust surrounding the black hole can dominate the near- and far - field disk fields at large gravitational radii ( @xmath7 cm ) , depending on the relative transition radii where the nf , ff , and scattered external radiation fields dominate ( appendix a ) .",
    "the transformed energy spectrum of the thermal accretion disk in the comoving frame displays a low - energy steepening for photons which originate primarily from radii @xmath4 .",
    "this is an important effect in photohadronic calculations of very high energy secondary production , and is also important in @xmath5-@xmath5 transparency calculations @xcite .",
    "other photon sources can make an additional contribution in this range . because the bulk of the black - hole accretion power is generated at small disk radii",
    ", the use of an optically - thin or optically - thick formulation at @xmath8 has negligible effect on the total scattered power for power - law electron injection with injection index @xmath9 .",

    "expressions for thomson - scattered spectra from nonthermal electrons with arbitrary energy and isotropic comoving pitch - angle distributions are derived for external isotropic and direct accretion - disk radiation fields .",
    "the electron equation - of - motion is solved in the regime where the total synchrotron and external thomson losses from the disk and quasi - isotropic external radiation fields dominate ssc losses .",
    "the evolving electron distribution is obtained through a continuity equation treatment with radiative losses on stationary electron injection over a range of radii , but here neglecting adiabatic losses .",
    "this simplified blazar model shows a dramatic change of spectral behavior if nonthermal particle acceleration continuously operates within @xmath10-@xmath11 from the black - hole engine . in the model studied here",

    "accretion - disk modeling is briefly mentioned (  5.1 ) before proceeding to derive the comoving energy spectrum of the disk field (  5.2 ) . the same problem for an optically - thin disk",
    "is treated in section 6 , and comparison with the approach of ds93 is made in section 7 .",

    "the appendices provide more detail on the derivations of the results in section 9 .",
    "in particular , appendices a.6 and a.7 show that different spectral states of blazars and extended jets are defined by the simple relations in equations ( [ rcomparison ] ) and ( [ rexj ] ) which govern the relative imporatance of the accretion - disk , scattered , and cmbr fields .",

    "the approach of @xcite avoids the need to transform scattered radiation spectra from the comoving to observer frames by directly transforming electron energy spectra to the stationary frame .",
    "this is useful in the case of specified comoving electron distributions .",
