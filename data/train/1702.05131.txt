    "we then decompose @xmath315 into a product of two quotients ,    @xmath320 note that the exponents in the right - hand quotient are all even .",
    "the quotient on the left is of the form @xmath321 , where @xmath322 and @xmath323 are integers , possibly negative .",
    "it is sufficient to show that @xmath322 and @xmath323 are both even .",
    "an examination of the exponents reveals that the parity of @xmath322 and @xmath323 depend only on @xmath1 and @xmath4 modulo 12 .",
    "a check of all possible combinations of these values using table [ table ] and lemma [ squaredivisor ] confirms that @xmath322 and @xmath323 are indeed even in all cases , and therefore we can write @xmath324 for some polynomial @xmath325 .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "here we compute @xmath326 , the divisor polynomial corresponding to the modular curve @xmath82 , which has genus 2 .",
    "a basis for @xmath327 is given by @xmath328 , with @xmath329 and @xmath330 the associated wronskian is @xmath331 then by lemma [ wpsquared ] and ( [ ftilde ] ) , we have @xmath332 but @xmath333 , @xmath334 , and @xmath335 therefore by theorem [ ftildesplit ] we have @xmath336    in general , @xmath80 may not be irreducible .",
