    "cosmological constant problem is one of most important problems in particle physics . from recent sophisticated observation @xcite",
    ", our universe is acceleratingly expanding at present .",
    "this implies that the universe is de sitter , namely , the four - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath0 is positive .",
    "according to the observed value , we have @xmath1 .",
    "when we would like to explain the reason why the @xmath0 is extremely small , from the viewpoint of field theory , we confront a huge hierarchy between the cosmological constant and planck scale .",
    "however it is expected that the origin of the hierarchy should be explained by the dynamics of underlying theory , for instance , string theory or m - theory .    as an interesting challenge to cosmological constant problem ,",
    "rubakov and shaposhnikov proposed a model that the vanishing four - dimensional cosmological constant can be realized in the framework of six - dimensional world with warped two extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "namely , the suggestion of warped extra dimensions enables einstein equations to have solutions with vanishing four - dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "based on the five - dimensional theory with an infinite extra dimension , an alternative proposal was done by randall and sundrum @xcite .",
    "the setup is that a flat @xmath2-brane is embedded in @xmath3 background geometry . in the randall - sundrum model ,",
    "the four - dimensional cosmological constant in brane is equal to zero due to the fine - tuning between the brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant , and the localized gravity on the brane generates the usual newton s law @xcite .",
    "thus the vanishing @xmath0 is obtained by using extra dimension and fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "however actual value of @xmath0 is not zero but very small .",
    "taking account of accelerating universe at present , we consider that it is necessary to embed four - dimensional de sitter brane into higher dimensional world .",
    "it was demonstrated that gravity can be localized on de sitter brane embedded in the five - dimensional curved background @xcite .",
    "thus this implies that there exists the normalizable zero mode which reproduces the usual four - dimensional newton s law at large distance .",
    "furthermore the extensions of randall - sundrum model were widely investigated @xcite . in the setup , we are interested in the value of the four - dimensional cosmological constant in de sitter brane .    in this paper , we consider a single de sitter brane embedded in five dimensions with positive , vanishing and negative bulk cosmological constant .",
    "we show that the four - dimensional cosmological constant in brane can be controlled by the curvature of bulk . in particular , in the case of negative bulk cosmological constant ,",
    "we show that the observed value of four - dimensional cosmological constant can be realized by tiny deviation from bulk curvature of the randall - sundrum model .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will present a setup considered here and we show the warp factors for positive , vanishing and negative bulk cosmological constant . in section 3",
    "we show that the resulting volcano potential in shr@xmath4dinger equation for the gravitational fluctuations .",
    "we point out that the gravity can be localized on the de sitter brane and there exists a normalizable zero mode . in section 4",
    "we calculate the normalization factor of the normalizable zero mode and derive the four - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath0 in brane .",
    "moreover we study the behavior of @xmath0 for the bulk curvature . finally our conclusions are described .",
    "we consider five - dimensional theory with a single @xmath2-brane and an infinite extra dimension @xmath5 .",
    "the action with brane tension @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are bulk cosmological constant and five - dimensional fundamental scale , respectively .",
    "the ansatz for metric in five dimensions is written in the following form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is warp factor and it is assumed that a fifth dimension @xmath5 has @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "the four - dimensional slice is de sitter as follows , @xmath13 here we define @xmath14 , where @xmath0 and @xmath15 are four - dimensional cosmological constant and planck scale , respectively . solving einstein equations of this setup , we can obtain warp factors for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 as follows , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a positive integration constant and the curvature of bulk is given by @xmath21 note that @xmath20 is the distance between the brane and the horizon . imposing the normalization condition @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 can be written in terms of @xmath20 , namely , we have @xmath24 for @xmath16 , @xmath25 for @xmath17 , and @xmath26 for @xmath18 .",
    "the delta function due to presence of a brane at @xmath27 leads to the relation between the brane tension @xmath6 and @xmath20 . for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,",
    "the brane tension is expressed as @xmath28 for each @xmath8 , positive @xmath20 yields the brane world with positive tension brane .",
    "localized gravity on the brane can be realized in setup considered here .",
    "let us review the localization of gravity @xcite .    by transforming from @xmath5 to conformally flat",
    "coordinate @xmath29 , the gravitational fluctuation @xmath30 around the background metric is governed by familiar one - dimensional shr@xmath4dinger equation as follows , @xmath31\\psi = m^{2}\\psi\\,,\\label{eqn11 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is volcano potential , @xmath33 corresponds to the fluctuation with dependence of @xmath34 and @xmath35 is four - dimensional mass .",
    "the conformally flat coordinate @xmath34 is given by @xcite @xmath36 where the constant @xmath37 is determined by imposing @xmath38 .",
    "concretely we obtain @xmath39 thus the conformally flat coordinate @xmath34 runs from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .    for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the resulting volcano potential in the shr@xmath4dinger equation",
    "is explicitly expressed as @xcite @xmath42 note that the wave function depends on both the form of the volcano potential and the range of eigenvalue @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore there no exist tachyon s modes @xmath44 since the hamiltonian in eq.([eqn11 ] ) is positive definite value @xcite . as described in eqs.([eqn18])@xmath45([eqn20 ] ) , the localization of gravity occurs due to an attractive force potential of delta function at origin .    for @xmath17 ,",
    "the potential is positive constant @xmath46 everywhere except at origin . for @xmath16 and @xmath18",
    ", the potential goes to a constant @xmath46 for @xmath47 . solving shr@xmath4dinger equation for @xmath48 , the wave function of @xmath17 is expressed in terms of exponential function while the wave functions of @xmath16 and @xmath18 can be written in terms of hypergeometric function @xcite . taking account of the delta function at origin and the finiteness of wave function , there exists only the wave function of @xmath49 for each @xmath8 . up to the normalization factor",
    ", wave functions of zero mode @xmath50 can be taken the following forms @xcite @xmath51 thus there exists a normalizable zero mode for each @xmath8 . on the other hand , the wave functions of @xmath52 become plane waves with continuous modes . consequently , there is a mass gap between the zero mode and massive continuous modes , and the beginning of massive mode starts from @xmath46 .",
    "the normalizable zero mode wave function can produce the four - dimensional newton s law . at large distance",
    "the small correction to newton s law is generated by the contributions of wave functions with continuous modes .",
    "using the result obtained in previous section , we can obtain the four - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "since the gravitational potential between two unit masses at distance @xmath53 via zero mode is expressed as @xmath54 , the planck scale is given by @xmath55 .",
    "performing the normalization integral of zero mode wave function in eqs.([eqn21])@xmath45([eqn23 ] ) , then we can obtain the normalization factor for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . using the normalization factor including @xmath23",
    ", we can get the four - dimensional cosmological constant in de sitter brane as follows @xmath56 where @xmath57 here we used @xmath58 .",
    "moreover we introduced a dimensionless parameter as follows @xmath59    note that @xmath60 is determined by the bulk curvature @xmath61 which is fixed by bulk cosmological constant @xmath8 .",
    "as described in eqs.([eqn24])@xmath45([eqn26 ] ) , we are interested in overall factor of @xmath62 for each @xmath8 .",
    "this is because it is possibility that the factor may generate not zero but tiny value of @xmath0 .",
    "let us investigate the value of overall factor for @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 , separately .    for @xmath17 , from eq.([eqn25 ] )",
    ", the observed value of @xmath0 leads to the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "namely , we have @xmath64 .",
    "accidentally , the five - dimensional fundamental scale is closely equal to the qcd scale .",
    "this implies that in the case of de sitter brane embedded in @xmath17 background , the observed value of the four - dimensional cosmological constant can not be phenomenologically obtained .    in the case of @xmath16 and @xmath18 , @xmath0",
    "is obviously determined by @xmath60 defined in eq.([eqn29 ] ) .",
    "it is necessary to study the behavior of @xmath0 for the variation of @xmath60 .    for @xmath16 , the overall factor @xmath65 , which determines the value of @xmath0 , is shown in figure.[fig1](dash curve ) .",
    "since the limit of @xmath66 yields @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 for @xmath69 . looking the relation between @xmath60 and background geometry",
    ", the transition from small @xmath60 to large @xmath60 corresponds to the continuous transition from @xmath16 background to @xmath17 background . as for warp factor , from eqs.([eqn4 ] ) and ( [ eqn5 ] ) , the warp factor of @xmath16 goes to the that of @xmath17 . for arbitrary @xmath60 ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath65 is almost order of the unity . in similar to the case of @xmath17 , we must take @xmath64 in order to obtain the observed value of the four - dimensional cosmological constant . thus in the case of @xmath16 background",
    "we can not obtain extremely tiny @xmath0 .    for @xmath18 , the overall factor @xmath70",
    "is shown as solid curve in figure.[fig1 ] . from eq.([eqn10 ] ) , we have @xmath69 . taking the limit of @xmath71",
    ", we have @xmath72 and eq.([eqn26 ] ) goes to eq.([eqn25 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , from eqs.([eqn5 ] ) and ( [ eqn6 ] ) , the warp factor of @xmath18 goes to the that of @xmath17 .",
    "this implies the transition from @xmath18 to @xmath17 .",
    "particularly the case of @xmath73 corresponds to a flat @xmath2-brane @xmath74 , obviously , this situation is as same as the randall - sundrum model of ref.@xcite .",
    "the point at @xmath73 leads to the bulk curvature of the randall - sundrum model as follows , @xmath75 from eq.([eqn6 ] ) and @xmath22 , in the limit of @xmath76 we obtain @xmath77 which is consistent with warp factor of the randall - sundrum model . in order to get not zero but tiny @xmath0 , we consider that the curvature of bulk has tiny deviation from @xmath78 .",
    "namely , we take @xmath79 , from eq.([eqn29 ] ) , @xmath80 is obtained .",
    "using @xmath81 , the four - dimensional cosmological constant in de sitter brane is given by @xmath82 as expected in theories with extra dimensions and in future collider lhc , adopting @xmath83 and observed value of @xmath0 , we have @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath85 is close to the lower bound at which gravitational experiments are performed in the future @xcite , then @xmath86 .",
    "thus we point out that , in de sitter brane embedded in five dimensions with negative bulk cosmological constant , it is possibility that not zero but extremely tiny @xmath0 comes from the extremely tiny deviation from bulk curvature of randall - sundrum model .",
    "we are interested in the recent observation that the four - dimensional cosmological constant @xmath0 is not zero but positive tiny constant .",
    "we considered the de sitter brane embedded in five dimensions with positive , vanishing and negative bulk cosmological constant @xmath8 . in the setup for each @xmath8",
    ", gravity can be localized on the brane and there exists a normalizable zero mode which generates the usual newton s law at large distance . by calculating the normalization integral of a zero mode",
    ", we derived @xmath0 for each @xmath8 . in the case of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , fundamental scale in five dimensions",
    "must be taken mev scale in order to obtain the observed value of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath18 , we pointed out that the observed value of @xmath0 can be realized by tiny deviation from bulk curvature of the randall - sundrum model . from the viewpoint of the cosmological constant",
    ", we should consider the system of a de sitter brane in @xmath18 background geometry . here",
    "we mention some comments . in this paper",
    "it is not saying that we solved the cosmological constant problem .",
    "since we considered the bulk cosmological constant as a parameter , we must explain the reason why the bulk curvature is vicinity of bulk curvature of the randall - sundrum model .",
    "namely the bulk curvature is determined by the bulk cosmological constant governed by the fundamental theory of high energy region , it is unknown whether a scenario considered here can be realized by the dynamics of fundamental theory .",
    "however we suggested a proposal to obtain not zero but extremely tiny four - dimensional cosmological constant without fine - tuning of couplings . in cosmological context a brane model presented here will be discussed in future .",
