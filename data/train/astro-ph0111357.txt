    "the long - sought compact remnant born in the supernova explosion was discovered in the first light image obtained with the x  ray satellite ( tananbaum 1999 ) . for the following reasons",
    "there is little doubt that cxo j232327.8 + 584842 ( cxo for brevity ) is indeed associated to , the youngest ( @xmath5320 yrs ) supernova remnant observed in the galaxy ( ashworth 1980 , fesen et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "first , the x  ray flux of @xmath510@xmath11 erg @xmath4 s@xmath12 ( pavlov et al .",
    "2000 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 ) and the strong upper limits on any optical / ir counterpart in the small ( 1@xmath13 radius ) error circle ( r@xmath926.3 , k@xmath921.2 , ryan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , kaplan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) , imply for cxo an x  ray to optical flux ratio greater than @xmath5800 .",
    "this immediately excludes any kind of non - compact galactic source as well as accreting binary systems , unless the companion star is a very low mass object .",
    "on the other hand the x  ray to optical flux ratio of cxo is similar to that of radio pulsars and other neutron star candidates ( see , e.g. , shearer & golden 2001 , treves et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "second , cxo is located at an angular distance @xmath147@xmath13 from the site of the supernova explosion , that has been recently re - determined with good accuracy by a backward projection of the expanding optical filaments ( thorstensen et al .",
    "2001 ) . for an age of 320 yrs and a distance of 3.4 kpc ( reed et al .",
    "1995 ) , the implied transverse speed of the neutron star would be @xmath5340 km s@xmath12 , well within the range of the observed space velocities of radio pulsars ( cordes & chernoff 1998 ) .",
    "finally , the possibility of a background extra - galactic source has been dismissed ( pavlov et al . 2000 ) on the basis of ( a ) the very small probability of finding an agn as bright as cxo within an area of only @xmath50.05 arcmin@xmath15 , and ( b ) the steep power law x  ray spectrum of cxo .",
    "although the association with is well established , the exact nature of cxo remains puzzling .",
    "deep radio observations ( mclaughlin et al . 2001 ) were unable to detect any source , either pulsed ( upper limit of 1.3 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) or unpulsed ( u.l . of 40 and 6 mjy at 1.3 and 4.4 ghz , respectively ) .",
    "a radio / x  ray synchrotron nebula could indicate the presence of a rapidly rotating , magnetized neutron star , even when beam orientation effects prevent its direct observation as a radio pulsar .",
    "however , no radio or x  ray ( murray et al . 2001 ) nebula has been found around cxo .",
    "the x  ray spectrum of cxo is not well constrained .",
    "equally good fits to the data were obtained with simple power law , blackbody and bremsstrahlung models ( pavlov et al . 2000 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 , murray et al .",
    "power law fits give a steep photon index @xmath16@xmath53 - 4 and a column density n@xmath17@xmath5(1.5 - 2.3)@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 , larger than the estimated value of the interstellar absorption in the direction of ( keohane et al .",
    "young neutron stars emitting in the x  ray band by non - thermal magnetospheric processes have harder spectra ( @xmath16@xmath51.5 ) and higher luminosity ( l@xmath18@xmath510@xmath19 - 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath12 ) than cxo .",
    "the fits with a blackbody model give kt@xmath21@xmath50.5 kev and n@xmath17@xmath510@xmath3 @xmath4 , but they imply an emitting area that , for any reasonable assumed distance , is far too small to be consistent with the surface of a neutron star .",
    "this discrepancy is not uncommon when fitting cooling neutron stars with simple blackbody spectra .",
    "larger emitting areas , more consistent with the neutron star dimensions , are generally obtained when more appropriate models for the thermal emission from neutron star atmospheres are used ( see , e.g. , zavlin et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) . however , pavlov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that in the case of also fits with neutron star atmosphere models imply emission from only a small fraction of the star surface .",
    "a re - analysis of archival einstein and rosat observations showed no evidence for long term variability ( pavlov et al . 2000 ) .",
    "search for x  ray pulsations have been carried out with by chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with negative results , and later by murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who reported a possible periodicity at 12 ms , but with a very low statistical significance .",
    "if this period were confirmed , it would be difficult to explain the lack of a strong pulsar wind nebula around cxo , unless its magnetic field is rather low ( @xmath145@xmath210@xmath22 g ) .",
    "here we report the results of an observation of cxo performed with the satellite on july 27@xmath23 , 2000 as part of the performance verification program .",
    "the data reported here were obtained with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instrument on the satellite .",
    "epic consists of two mos ccd detectors ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) and a pn ccd instrument ( strder et al . 2001 ) , giving a total collecting area @xmath24 2500 cm@xmath15 at 1.5 kev .",
    "the mirror system offers an on - axis fwhm angular resolution of 4 - 5@xmath13 and a field of view of 30@xmath26 diameter .",
    "the observation of started at 6:45 ut of july 27@xmath23 , 2000 and lasted about 11 hours .",
    "the telemetry saturation due to the high overall counting rate from the supernova remnant caused a non - continuous operation of the ccds , yielding effective exposures of 9219 s in the pn , and 23573 s and 23594 s in the mos1 and mos2 detectors , respectively .",
    "the satellite was pointed at the center of the remnant ( ra : 23@xmath27 23@xmath28 25@xmath29 , dec : 58@xmath30 48@xmath26 20@xmath13 ( j2000 ) ) , resulting in the detection of cxo very close to the center of the epic field of view ( off - axis angle of 0.52@xmath26 ) . during this observation",
    "the thin filter was used .",
    "the mos cameras were operated in large window mode to limit the source photon pile - up .",
    "the background corrected count rates of cxo were 0.25@xmath310.02 and 0.13@xmath310.01 counts s@xmath12 , respectively in the pn and in each mos .",
    "the data were analyzed with version 5.2 of the science analysis system .",
    "the counts for the spectral analysis were extracted in the three epic cameras from circles with 10@xmath13 radii centered at the position of cxo .",
    "the corresponding background corrected count rates were 0.25@xmath310.02 and 0.13@xmath310.01 counts s@xmath12 , respectively in the pn and in each mos .",
    "such a small radius , enclosing only about 50% of the counts from a point source , was chosen to avoid contamination from bright nearby filaments due to the emission from the supernova remnant ( see the images of murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) .",
    "all the spectral fits reported below were obtained with the appropriate response matrices that take into account the dimensions of the extraction region .",
    "the derived fluxes are corrected for the fraction of counts outside the 10@xmath13 circle .",
    "cxo is relatively faint compared to the non - uniform , diffuse emission due to .",
    "we estimate that the background accounts for @xmath575 - 80% of the counts within the adopted extraction radius ( 14050 for the pn and 13320 for the mos1 ) . therefore , we devoted particular attention to the choice of the region for the extraction of the background spectra .",
    "based on the high resolution images , we tried different regions with a surface brightness similar to that at the position of cxo and avoiding bright filaments .",
    "we found that the resulting cxo spectra are somewhat dependent on the chosen background that can lead to the presence of residuals near the energies of the strongest emission lines .",
    "such residuals in the background subtracted spectra were minimized using the background from a rectangular ( @xmath520@xmath215 arcsec@xmath15 ) region to the east of cxo , roughly corresponding to the eastern half of that used in the analysis by chakrabarty et al .",
    "the spectra discussed below were obtained with this choice of the background region .",
    "for the pn spectra we used photons corresponding to single and double events , after checking that the individual single and double events spectra gave the same results within the uncertainties .",
    "the energy channels were grouped to have at least 30 net counts per bin , and the fits were performed in the 0.6 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "the results of power - law , blackbody and bremsstrahlung fits are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the same extraction and binning criteria were applied to the two mos cameras .",
    "while the results obtained with mos1 agree with the pn ones ( see table  1 ) , the mos2 fits gave different parameters and worse @xmath32 values .",
    "we found that this discrepancy is due to the fact that at the time of the observation of the offset calculation for the mos cameras was still based on an imperfect on - board algorithm ( only later in the mission better fixed tables were implemented ) .",
    "this problem can cause spurious event detections in channels close to the low energy threshold and also produces an offset of the energy scale in particular regions of the ccd . by carefully examining the mos2 image and comparing spectra of different regions",
    ", we verified that in this observation such an effect occurred just at the position of cxo in the mos2 .",
    "since these effects can not be easily corrected , we did not consider the mos2 spectra in our further analysis .",
    "to better constrain the spectral parameters , we fitted jointly the pn and mos1 data ( table  1 ) .",
    "the power law and bremsstrahlung models give better fits to the data , while the fit with a blackbody ( fig.1 ) yields higher @xmath32 values .",
    "for comparison with the results of murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we present in table  1 also the values obtained by fixing n@xmath17=1.1@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 , and by adding a power law to the blackbody model .",
    "for all the models , the observed 0.1 - 10 kev flux from the joint pn - mos1 fits is of the order of @xmath52@xmath210@xmath11 erg @xmath4 s@xmath12 .",
    "the systematic difference between the pn and mos1 fluxes must be ascribed to the uncertainties in the relative calibration of the two detectors .",
    "the errors on the luminosities reported in table 1 have been computed taking into account the uncertainties of the spectral parameters and absorption ( 90% c.l . for two interesting parameters ) .    for the timing analysis we extracted all the counts with energy in the 1 to 6 kev energy range from circles with radius 10@xmath13 centered on the cco position .",
    "this yielded respectively 12276 , 12652 and 12511 counts for the pn , mos1 and mos2 detectors .",
    "the upper limits reported below take into account that the background , estimated from nearby regions , accounts for @xmath575% of these counts .",
    "after correction of the arrival times to the solar system barycenter , a fourier analysis of the background subtracted light curves was performed using the method described in israel & stella ( 1996 ) .",
    "the frequency resolution was 2.46@xmath210@xmath33 hz . the frame integration times of 0.073 and 0.9 s , respectively in the pn and mos cameras , set the upper limits to the explored frequency ranges .",
    "no significant periodicity was found .",
    "the upper limits on the pulsed fraction , computed according to vaughan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , are shown in fig .  2 as a function of the frequency .",
    "the curves refer to the 3@xmath8 upper limit on the source pulsed fraction in the 1 - 6 kev energy range assuming a sinusoidal modulation . above 0.4 hz",
    "only the pn data could be used , while at lower frequencies we could sum the power spectra from the three instruments , thus improving the sensitivity as shown by the lower curve of fig .  2 .",
    "also separate searches in the soft ( 1 - 2 kev ) and hard ( 2 - 6 kev ) energy ranges gave negative results .",
    "the corresponding upper limits are about a factor two higher than those shown in fig .  2 .",
    "our spectral results can be compared with those derived from the observations . in the power law case ,",
    "our best fit values for @xmath16 and n@xmath17 are consistent with the values found by chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but not with the more recent findings of murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who obtain a softer and more absorbed spectrum .",
    "the temperature values that we find for the bremsstrahlung and blackbody models are higher than the values , and the corresponding column densities slightly smaller .",
    "the blackbody normalization of our fits implies an emitting area with radius of 0.32d@xmath34 km , smaller than that inferred with . to check whether the discrepancy with respect to the results might be explained by the higher background contribution in the epic spectral extraction region",
    ", we also performed an analysis with smaller source extraction regions , down to a radius of 5@xmath13 ( always using the appropriate response matrices ) .",
    "the derived best fit parameters did not vary significantly .    the above mentioned difficulties in interpreting the x  ray emission from cxo in terms of a young active pulsar",
    "are therefore confirmed by our results .",
    "an independent knowledge of the expected column density could help to discriminate among the various spectral models .",
    "values in the range ( 0.9 - 1.3)@xmath210@xmath3 @xmath4 have been derived by keohane et al . ( 1996 ) , with significant variations across the remnant and with relatively smaller absorption at the position of cxo . on this basis , the thermal bremsstrahlung fit is the one giving the most consistent n@xmath17 value . the low absorption , as well as",
    "the higher @xmath32 value , suggests that the simple blackbody fit is not adequate .",
    "the trend of the residuals shown in the lower panel of fig .  1 ( see also fig.3 of murray et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) probably indicates that atmosphere models more complex than simple blackbody spectra are required .",
    "the soft spectrum and high x  ray to optical flux ratio make cxo similar to the anomalous x  ray pulsars ( axps , mereghetti 2001a ) . these objects have periods in the 6 - 12 s range , steadily increasing on timescales of @xmath510@xmath35 - 10@xmath36 years , and two ( possibly three ) of them are located at the center of shell - like supernova remnants .",
    "similar properties ( except for the periodicity ) are shared by the x  ray sources at the center of the supernova remnants puppis a ( petre et al .",
    "1996 , zavlin et al .",
    "1999 ) , g290.5 + 10.0 ( mereghetti et al . 1996 , zavlin et al . 1998 ) , rcw 103 ( gotthelf et al . 1999 ) , and g266.1 - 1.2 ( slane et al .",
    "2001 , mereghetti 2001b , pavlov et al .",
    "the bolometric blackbody luminosity and temperature of all these sources are plotted in fig .  3 , where for comparison we have also included two classes of older neutron stars : three middle aged radio pulsars from which thermal emission from internal cooling has been observed ( psr b1055 - 52 , psr b0656 + 14 , and geminga ; see , e.g. , becker & trmper 1997 ) and several nearby isolated neutron stars ( treves et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "for all the sources in which also a non - thermal spectral component is present , we have plotted in fig .",
    "3 only the bolometric luminosity of the blackbody component .",
    "the axps have on average a higher luminosity than the central compact objects ( ccos ) in supernova remnants , but their blackbody temperatures are very similar .",
    "although the majority of axps and ccos have quite stable luminosity , there are two interesting variable sources that might be intermediate objects linking these two classes .",

    "alpar ( 2001 ) proposed a unified interpretation of the classes of objects shown in fig .  3 , in which they are all assumed to be neutron stars with ordinary magnetic fields ( 10@xmath40 - 10@xmath41 g ) , thus avoiding the need for super - critical magnetic fields required by the `` magnetar '' models for axps ( e.g. , thompson & duncan 1996 ) .",
    "according to alpar ( 2001 ) , isolated neutron stars experience a mass inflow due to the formation of a residual accretion disk from fallback material after the supernova explosion .",
    "this causes an evolutionary phase in the propeller regime , before the neutron star turns on as a radio pulsar or as an axp , depending on the initial conditions in terms of rotational period , magnetic field and mass in the residual disk ( see also chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 for a similar model ) .",
    "the dim , nearby neutron stars in the lower left corner of fig .",

    "the ccos would be the propeller objects with the highest mass inflow , surrounded by an optically thick corona and might evolve into axp ( alpar 2001 ) .",
    "searches for periodicities in the ccos extending to low frequencies are therefore relevant , since some of these objects might have periods similar to those of the axp . in this respect ,",
    "we note that , while the cco in g290.5 + 10.0 has a fast period of 424 ms ( zavlin et al . 2000 ) and might be a  radio - quiet  pulsar similar to geminga , the fast periodicity at 75 ms reported in the puppis a cco ( pavlov et al . 1999 ) has not been confirmed by more accurate observations ( pavlov et al .",

    "the spectral analysis confirmed the very soft spectrum of cxo , but yields , in the case of thermal models , higher temperatures than those measured earlier with .",
    "the source luminosity does not show evidence of long term variations when compared with previous measurements .    as for other candidate neutron stars in supernova remnants older than , the overall properties of cxo are difficult to explain in terms of a rapidly spinning neutron star with a canonical magnetic field of @xmath510@xmath10 g , and are more similar to those of slowly rotating neutron stars such as the axps .",
