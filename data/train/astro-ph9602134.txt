    "the full expression is not the point here ; the important message is that we have an infinite hierarchy of equations .",
    "mathematically , this is similar to the bbgky hierarchy : in order to solve for an @xmath34-point function , we need to know @xmath35- and @xmath36-point correlations .",
    "perturbation theory may help , but not without further assumptions , necessary to close the infinite hierarchy of correlation functions . here",
    "we will assume that @xmath37 is a random gaussian field .",

    "comparing model predictions with observations can help us decide whether the early universe was gaussian or not .",
    "the greatest advantage of our assumption is simplicity . indeed : all odd - order correlation functions of @xmath18 vanish , and all even - order moments can be reduced to the two - point function . for example , for the first four moments we have @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 , while @xmath42 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : master ] ) in terms of @xmath42 .",
    "this will close the hierarchy , allowing us to calculate weakly nonlinear corrections for the 2-point function @xmath44 .",
    "the same procedure can be applied for higher order correlation functions .",
    "this simple idea is at the root of all perturbative results , discussed below .",
    "perturbative calculations are usually easier after applying the fourier transform .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath44 is the power spectrum , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the comoving wavenumber .",
    "the linear term in the perturbative expansion for @xmath45 is @xmath47 the basic properties of linear evolution , as well as the effect of nonlinear interactions can be deduced from the functional form of @xmath20 and @xmath48 . indeed , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) , all fluctuations evolve without changing the shape of their density profiles , so that we can expect that the linear power spectrum evolves without changing its slope ( the growth rate is the same for all scales ) .",
    "this is indeed the case . if @xmath49 at some initial time @xmath50 , than at later times @xmath51 .",
    "a second characteristic property of a linear field is that its distribution function remains gaussian ; only its width , @xmath52 grows in time as @xmath53 .",
    "neither of these properties remain valid when nonlinear interactions become important .",
    "the nonlinear terms , describing tidal interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quad ] ) redistribute power across the spectrum , and growth rates may be enhanced at some wavenumbers and suppressed at others : the logarithmic slope @xmath54 is no longer constant , it can now change with time .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear evolution introduces deviations from gaussian statistics .",
    "the lowest - order moment which can detect such deviations is the skewness , @xmath55 .",
    "the gaussian distribution is symmetric about @xmath56 , and its skewness is zero .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : quad ] ) , however , the fluctuations with positive initial density contrast @xmath20 grow more rapidly than those with @xmath57 . hence",
    ", nonlinear interactions introduce asymmetry in the distribution , and we can expect that with time , gravity will induce a non - zero skewness in the distribution .",
    "the earliest ( to our knowledge ) analytic results of weakly nonlinear calculations were obtained by zeldovich et al .",
    "and peebles .",
    "they considered power - law initial conditions , @xmath58 , and showed that unless @xmath59 , the nonlinear terms become larger than linear at large scales , and the perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "a somewhat more systematic approach , going beyond scaling relations was introduced in the eighties by juszkiewicz et al . and vishniac @xcite , who used eulerian perturbation theory and the random phase approximation to study the first non - trivial , weakly - nonlinear corrections for second moments  @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "peebles @xcite used the same approach to calculate the gravitationally induced skewness , while fry , in a truly seminal paper , showed how to calculate a reduced correlation function of arbitrary order @xmath34 , using the perturbative expansion , truncated at the @xmath62 -st order @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , n - body simulations , available in the early eighties were too crude to study the range of validity of perturbative methods . moreover , the galaxy surveys at scales , large enough to probe the weakly nonlinear regime of clustering , were dominated by noise .",
    "this made further progress in analytic calculations difficult and the field became dormant for several years . with time , the dynamical range of the simulations improved by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the length scales in galaxy surveys , at which correlations can be accurately measured , increased by an order of magnitude @xcite , making weakly nonlinear theory useful in their analysis .",
    "as a result of these developments , the study of the evolution of the mass distribution in the expanding universe has become a rich topic for analytic perturbative methods .",
    "the revival of enthusiasm for analytic calculations produced many new results .",
    "it is our purpose to briefly summarize some of these new results here . for a more detailed approach ,",
    "see e.g. the recent lecture notes of bouchet @xcite and the review by sahni & coles @xcite .",
    "the last issue we need to discuss before moving on to the next section is spatial smoothing .",
    "it is useful to employ a field @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 is replaced by @xmath65 , with @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a spherically symmetric window function .",
    "@xmath68 is the characteristic comoving smoothing length : @xmath69 decreases rapidly for @xmath70 .",
    "its fourier representation acts as a low pass filter , suppressing the fuctuations with wavenumbers @xmath71 .",
    "the usual normalization condition requires @xmath72 . smoothing over a ball of radius @xmath68",
    "is also called `` top hat '' smoothing ; another popular filter is a fuzzy ball with a gaussian profile of width @xmath68 . note that the effects of smoothing and gravitational evolution are interchangeable only for @xmath20 ; for terms of second or higher order , these two effects _ do not _ commute ( this is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : quad ] ) ; see also @xcite ) . for a power - law initial spectrum ,",
    "the smoothed linear variance is @xmath73 so the condition @xmath74 ensures that the clustering process is hierarchical , and proceeds from small to large scales .",
    "( this constraint , together with the zeldovich - peebles condition @xmath59 , broadly determines the range of `` reasonable '' values of @xmath75 ; a mix of observational arguments and theoretical prejudce shrinks this range to @xmath76 , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the smoothing procedure is needed for at least two reasons .",
    "first , at any stage of the evolution , in order to be able to use the perturbation theory , we need to smooth - out the strong nonlinearities . in all hierarchical models , this can be done by any a low pass filter of width @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the current nonlinear scale , defined by the condition @xmath79 .",
    "the second reason for introducing the smoothing is practical : all observable quantities , derived from galaxy surveys or numerical experiments , involve spatial smoothing .",
    "hereafter , we will deal with smoothed fields almost without exceptions ( which will be explicitly stated ) , so to simplify notation , we will omit the bars over @xmath30 and @xmath80 .",
    "generally , we will also assume gaussian initial conditions ( again , all exceptions will be properly described ) .",
    "the perturbative series ( [ eq : series ] ) can be used to expand the second moment of the density field in powers of the linear variance , @xmath81 . squaring @xmath30 and averaging , we get @xmath82 the second and third term in this expansion are the lowest order nonlinear corrections to linear theory .",
    "these terms are of order @xmath83 because @xmath84 terms vanish under the random phase assumption .",
    "the quantities @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be determined from perturbation theory .",
    "they were recently calculated for power - law initial conditions by scoccimarro & frieman @xcite and by okas et al .",
    "scoccimarro & frieman explored the evolution of an unsmoothed density field .",
    "okas et al .",
    "studied spatially smoothed fields , and found that nonlinear tidal interactions redistribute the power in the spectrum in such a way , that for @xmath87 , the correction @xmath88 is negative .",
    "the growth rate of density fluctuations is inhibited : @xmath89 is smaller than the linear prediction @xmath90 .",
    "the magnitude of this suppression increases with @xmath75 , or with the relative amount of small scale power in the initial spectrum . for @xmath91",
    ", there is an opposite effect ",
    "the fluctuation growth rate is enhanced @xmath92 .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath93 , when the correction is close to zero and @xmath94 .",
    "okas et al . compared these perturbative results with a series of n - body simulations and found a good agreement in a wide dynamical range , up to @xmath95 .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the so - called _ previrialization conjecture _ of davis & peebles @xcite .",
    "according to davis & peebles , tidally induced nonradial motions of small scale inhomogeneities within collapsing mass concentrations should resist gravity and slow down the collapse . until recently the size of the previrialization effect was still under discussion , with some n - body studies reproducing the effect and others claiming its absence .",
    "for example , peebles @xcite found strong support for the previrialization effect , while evrard & crone @xcite reached opposite conclusions .",
    "this apparent controversy can be resolved , using the perturbative results we just discussed .",
    "indeed , peebles in his simulations assumed @xmath96 , while evrard & crone assumed @xmath93 : a spectral index , for which nonlinear effects are minimal .",
    "jain & bertschinger @xcite used perturbation theory and n - body experiments to investigate the nonlinear transfer of power in a cdm spectrum .",
    "their results are consistent with okas et al . and scoccimarro & frieman .",
    "finally , we must mention the important work of makino et al .",
    "@xcite , who succeeded in reducing the dimensionality of the mode coupling integrals of vishniac and juszkiewicz et al . .",
    "this significantly simplified the derivation of all of the new results described in this section .",
    "as we saw in section 1 , nonlinear gravitational evolution drives the field @xmath30 away from the initial gaussian distribution .",
    "deviations from gaussianity can be measured by _ cumulants _ , also called `` reduced '' or `` connected '' moments .",
    "a cumulant of order @xmath34 is @xmath97 for the first four cumulants , this expression generates the mean , @xmath98 , the variance , @xmath99 , the skewness , @xmath100 , and the kurtosis , @xmath101 .",
    "for a zero - mean gaussian distribution , all cumulants vanish except @xmath102 .",
    "the skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution , while the kurtosis measures the flattening of the tails relative to a gaussian .",
    "using perturbation theory , fry @xcite showed that in an einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath103 scale like @xmath104 .",
    "hence , to lowest non - vanishing order in perturbation theory , the ratio @xmath105 is time - independent .",
    "juszkiewicz et al .",
    "@xcite have recently used this property and the edgeworth series to describe the weakly nonlinear evolution of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field .",

    "a similar expansion was obtained independently by bernardeau & kofman @xcite .",
    "the edgeworth expansion is particuraly useful when only a few low - order reduced moments are known ; it can be also used to estimate low - order @xmath111 -s from the shape of empirically measured pdf near the peak ( in realistic situations , the tails , and/or high-@xmath34 moments are poorly known anyway ) .",
    "an alternative , laplace - transform representation for the pdf , which does require the knowledge of all @xmath111 -s to @xmath112 , was proposed by bernardeau @xcite .",
    "the acual values of the parameters @xmath111 can be also calculated perturbatively .",
    "the results generally depend on the shape of the initial power spectrum and the shape of the window function .",
    "let us begin with the skewness , responsible for the lowest order nonlinear correction to the gaussian pdf in eq .",
    "( [ eq : edge ] ) . upon raising both sides of equation ( [ eq : series ] ) to the third power and averaging",

    "the scaling with @xmath89 is completely different in models with non - gaussian initial conditions and an intrinsic skewness @xmath115 : the lowest order term is @xmath116 .",
    "the skewness parameter , @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : skew ] ) was first calculated by peebles @xcite , assuming @xmath118 and no smoothing .",

    "note that here , as well as in section 2 , we quote only results for the einstein - de sitter case .",
    "all these results , however , are also true for a much wider class of models with arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath121 ( this is an approximate statement , but the approximation is good enough for all practical purposes ) .",

    "when @xmath175 , and for spectral slopes @xmath176 , the differences between redshift - space @xmath117 and its true value are smaller than 10% , whatever the value of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the comparison between theoretical predictions and observations is not obscured by redshift space distortions provided we use the moment ratio @xmath117 rather than reduced moments themselves .",
    "the parameters @xmath117 and @xmath132 have been estimated from the cfa and ssrs surveys @xcite , the _ iras _ 1.2 jy sample @xcite , as well as for vaious angular catalogues .",
    "all these measurements show beautiful agreement with the predicted scaling relation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "the dependence ( [ eq : s3 g ] ) of @xmath177 on the shape of the bias function may explain why the value measured by bouchet et al .",
    "@xcite from the top - hat smoothed , _ iras _ redshift survey is rather low , @xmath178 .",
    "the galaxies observable in the infrared are underrepresented in rich clusters relative to optical galaxies , so the `` bias function '' that applies to _ iras _ galaxies may have negative curvature ( @xmath179 ) , pushing @xmath177 below the value of @xmath117 for the mass .",
    "if cluster avoidance is indeed the cause of the low value of @xmath180 , then one would expect that optically selected surveys would yield higher values .",
    "the values of @xmath177 , obtained recently by gaztaaga @xcite from the apm survey suggest that this is exactly the case .",
    "the value of @xmath177 , deprojected from the two - dimensional apm data onto three - dimensional space is @xmath181 , assuming a top - hat filter with a radius @xmath182mpc ( here @xmath183 is the hubble constant in units @xmath184 ; the latter condition ensures @xmath185 ) . substituting @xmath93 , appropriate for the slope , seen in the apm survey on these scales , into equation ( [ eq : s3 ] ) yields @xmath186 .",
    "hence , for sufficiently large scales , the apm results are in perfect agreement with second order perturbation theory : @xmath187 .",
    "this agreement provides support for three theoretical assumptions : first , that gravitational instability is responsible for the growth of clustering ; second , that the initial conditions were gausssian ; and third , that the apm galaxies trace the mass , i.e. , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s3 g ] ) @xmath188 and @xmath189 ( of course , other combinations of @xmath190 and @xmath191 also fit the apm data , but they require a coincidental compensation of the linear , @xmath192 factor by the @xmath191 term arising from nonlinear bias ) .",
    "this is bad news non - local biasing models like the model of bower et al .",
    "@xcite , invoked in a desperate attempt to explain the mismatch of the observed power spectrum with standard cdm . indeed , as demonstrated by frieman & gaztaaga @xcite , such models break the scaling relation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) and are incompatible with observations .",
    "most recently , gaztaaga & mhnen @xcite have used the apm data to severely constrain the so - called global texture model .",
    "the source of problems for this model is its prediction that @xmath193 parameters must ` blow up ' at large scales , like @xmath117 in our example in eq .",
    "( [ eq : blowup ] ) .",
    "there is no trace of such behaviour in the apm galaxy distribution .",
    "since the already available data can be used to constrain non - local biasing schemes and deviations from gaussian distribution , we can expect that in the new generations of catalogues ( like the sdss and the 2df , described in these proceedings ) will finally tell us whether all we are looking at is just a gaussian random process modified by plain gravity .",

    "<S> these terms become important in the weakly nonlinear regime of gravitational clustering , when the rms mass density contrast is only slightly smaller than unity . in the past , theorists showed little interest in studying this regime , and for a good reason : only a decade ago , it would have been an academic excercise  at scales large enough to probe the weakly nonlinear regime , all measures of clustering were dominated by noise . </S>",
