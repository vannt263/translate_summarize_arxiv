    "the second law of thermodynamics is one of the pillars of modern science , enjoying a fundamental status comparable only to that of the law of conservation of energy . yet despite the efforts of many distinguished researchers a definitive mathematical formulation of the law has not been achieved so far .",
    "the range of applicability of the second law extends well - beyond the confines of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics @xcite , indeed in this work we only consider combinatorial embodiments of the second law , and thus we further refer to it simply as the second law .",
    "+ there are many different but equivalent formulations of second law , as well as a few formulations whose equivalence is not fully understood .",
    "the reader will find in @xcite mathematically inclined introductions to the subject from quite different viewpoints . in this work",
    "however we stick to the following formulation of the second law due to boltzmann :    `` the entropy of an isolated system is almost always increasing . ''    to make sense of this statement several precisions are in order :    * a dynamical system is isolated if it does nt interchange neither matter or heat with its surroundings .",
    "we typically think of it as a system enclosed in an insulating box .",
    "note that the universe as hole is , by definition , an isolated system @xcite . *",
    "the word `` increasing '' is taken in the weak sense , i.e. entropy tends to grow or to be stable , and both cases are allowed by the second law . *",
    "often a stronger version of the second law  due to gibbs  is implied : entropy tends to increase strictly until the system reaches the state of highest entropy , and then it remains there almost for ever .",
    "we do not further consider this stronger version of the second law .",
    "* entropy is understood in the boltzmann s sense : it is a logarithmic measure of the number of micro - realizations of a macro - state .",
    "the boltzmann approach to the second law has been studied by a number of authors , the interested reader may consult @xcite . * in contrast with energy  that is always conserved ",
    "entropy increases almost surely .",
    "decreasing entropy is not ruled out , on the contrary , it is actually predicted by the second law , else the word `` almost '' could be omitted ; it just has a extremely low probability , making it a non - available option for most practical purposes .",
    "the second law itself does not provide a method for bounding or estimating these probabilities .",
    "* we refer to the statement of the second law with the word `` almost '' omitted as the strict second law .",
    "whenever entropy decreases we say that a violation of the strict second law has occurred .",
    "_ a different approach to the second law  based on gibb s entropy  has been studied by jaynes @xcite . in this approach",
    "the notion of equilibrium plays the central role .",
    "the boltzmann approach to the second law is meant to cover both equilibrium and away from equilibrium processes @xcite , indeed in section [ spmms ] we introduce a construction making this statement more precise . _    note",
    "that the boltzman s entropy relies in a essential way on the distinction between micro and macro states .",
    "we formalize this schism in section [ mmds ] , where we introduce the notion of micro - macro dynamical systems within a combinatorial context .",
    "the micro - macro divide admits a couple of dual interpretations . on the one hand , we take micro - states as primordial , and then macro - states are understood as what the observer measures when the system is in a given micro - state . on the other hand , we take the macro states as primordial : the scientist has no full control on the preparation of micro - states , he or she can only tell on what macro - state it lies as a result result of a preparation , but not the particular micro - state achieved . as we shall see , the choice of interpretation leads to different , but related , mathematical problems .",
    "+ although boltzmann himself was aware of the combinatorial ( counting ) nature of the second law , arising from the notion of coarse - graining , it seems that this idea with powerful potential applications hasnt had the impact that it deserves within the combinatorial community .",
    "the recent works of niven @xcite may be regarded as a step towards making the connection combinatorics / second law explicit .",
    "it is our believe that the combinatorial approach to the second law should be pursued in all its depth . in this contribution , we lay down some foundational ideas , introduce the main problems of study , and establish some basic results in the field .",
    "+ the main advantage of working within a combinatorial context is that we can define and compute with certain objects that may be elusive in other contexts .",
    "for example , the set of reversible dynamical systems on a finite set is just the set of permutations on it , with cardinality given by the factorial numbers .",
    "also , often combinatorial methods lead to algorithms suitable for numerical computation . so hypothesis and conjectures may be prove even if a solid mathematical result is not available .",
    "moreover , it is expected that by considering finite sets of arbitrarily large cardinalities one can approach the infinite case .",
    "thus combinatorial models may serve both as a guide and as a computational technique for attacking the more involved case allowing infinitely many states .",
    "+ the distribution of micro - states among macro - states gives us the notion of boltzmann entropy , and also a probability measure on macro - states to which one can compute the shannon entropy , among other things .",
    "a reversible deterministic dynamics defined at the level of micro - states , induces a stochastic transition map on macro - states . of course one could start with a stochastic dynamics on micro - states as well , but we refrain to do so for a couple of reasons",
    "first , we think that it is worth seeing random phenomena arising straight from a fully deterministic process . and second , the deterministic case is interesting in itself , and deserves to be study .",
    "+ in section [ mmds ] we introduce the settings on which we develop our work .",
    "we often use the language of category theory , but only the most basic notions are required @xcite .",
    "we introduce micro - macro dynamical systems and formulate the main problem in the combinatorial approach to the second law , namely , counting the number of violations of the stric second law for arbitrary permutations and partitions on a finite set .",
    "a prominent role is played by the notion of mean boltzamnn entropy .",
    "+ in section [ spmms ] we study structural operations on micro - macro dynamical system , and provide some general constructions of micro - macro configurations .",
    "a micro - macro configuration suitable for studying non - equilibrium transitions in micro - macro dynamical systems is provided . in section [ fsl ]",
    "we consider the case of full applicability of the strict second law , i.e. micro - macro dynamical systems with no violation of the strict second law .",
    "we approach this problem from two different viewpoints , first we assume the macro - states as given and let the dynamics vary , and second we assume the dynamics as given a let the macro - states vary . + in section [ sllip ] we reformulate the main problem in the combinatorial approach to the second law as a linear integer programming problem , which allows us to fully analyze some simple but revealing cases , and opens the door for numerical computations . in section [ mfsl ] we consider maximal number of violations of the strict second law .",
    "we introduce a couple of upper bounds on the number of violations of the second law .",
    "the first bound is sharp within a limited context , and a second bound which is sharp in general .",
    "both bounds have a transparent combinatorial origin .",
    "the second bound is built recursively using the notion of restriction of a micro - macro dynamical system .",
    "we display a couple examples and draw some general conclusions .",
