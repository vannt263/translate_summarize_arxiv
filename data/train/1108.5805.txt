    "display a maximum value for the quality factor at some proper radius . for smaller radius ,",
    "the boundary scattering is more important than the phonon - phonon scattering , so the increase of life time overpasses the decrease of frequency , leading to the increase of quality factor . in large resonator , the phonon - phonon scattering is more important , so the situation becomes opposite and the quality factor decreases with increasing radius . for a given radius , the phonon - phonon scattering is stronger at higher temperature .",
    "hence , the phonon - phonon scattering will become more important than the boundary scattering in resonators with smaller radii and at higher temperature . as a result",
    ", the maximum quality factor is achieved at smaller radius if temperature is higher .    [ 1.0 ]    with the recurrent time @xmath27 and the circumference of resonator @xmath43 , we can estimate the recurrent velocity @xmath44 .",

    "we are interesting to investigate how the recurrence affects the correlation function , although we have only used the function for @xmath48 . in case of @xmath49 ,",
    "the recurrent effect happens before the damping of the torsional vibration , so the recurrent wave will couple to the original wave in the correlation .",

    "[ fig_radius ] shows the curve of @xmath51 at room temperature , where @xmath52 with constant @xmath53 km / s as the recurrent velocity at 300 k. it shows that the recurrent effect will have influence for resonator with @xmath54   .",
    "if the md simulation can be done for resonator with radius @xmath55   , the recurrent effect will be much weaker on the fitting procedure of the correlation function .",
    "for extremely large resonator , there will be no recurrent effect as @xmath27 is almost infinity .",
    "[ fig_temperature ]  ( b ) shows the temperature dependence for the frequency of three resonators with radius @xmath56 4.5 , 9.0 , and 15.0   .",

    "these three curves can be fitted to functions : @xmath57 , with parameters @xmath58 as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "overall , the frequency is not sensitive to temperature and the shift is within @xmath62 below 300 k. we expect this blue - shift can be measured in the experiment , while current experiments focus on the temperature dependence of other vibration modes such as radial breathing modes in the carbon nanotube.@xcite panel ( c ) is the life time at different temperatures .",
    "they can be described by power functions @xmath63 , where parameters @xmath64 are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 in three resonators .",
    "it is interesting that the power factor @xmath68 is less than 1.0 in all of the three resonators .",
    "the phonon life time is inversely proportional to the temperature in bulk materials,@xcite because the three - phonon scattering is the major process for the damping of the phonon vibration in bulk materials .",
    "however , in nano - materials such as the graphene resonator , the boundary effect provides another channel for phonon decaying , which is temperature independent .",
    "the combination of the phonon - phonon scattering and the boundary effect leads to a power factor @xmath68 less than 1.0 . for larger resonator with @xmath69   ,",
    "the power factor @xmath70 is closer to the value of 1 than the other two smaller resonators where @xmath71 .",
    "it implies that the boundary effect is weaker in larger resonator , which is quite reasonable . as a result of the temperature dependence of the life time",

    ", the quality factor is very low for the torsional resonator simulated in our work .",
    "the boundary effect on the quality factor has also been pointed out by kim and park.@xcite * if the atoms on the boundary are fixed and let the atoms at the center free , the resonator will undergo a bending oscillation instead of torsional oscillation . in this type of circular bending resonator , kim and park have shown that the scattering by free edges will be considerably removed . as a result , the quality factor can be higher than 2000 at room temperature and increase to be @xmath72 at 10 k.@xcite * in fig .",
    "[ fig_temprofile ] , the boundary effect is disclosed by the temperature distribution in the resonator .",
    "the temperatures of the inner six carbon atoms are zero , as they are fixed during md simulation .",
    "there is a temperature jump between the edge atoms and the inner carbon atoms , which results from the edge modes localized in this free boundary region.@xcite    we further remark that the torsional resonator described in our manuscript may be difficult to be realized in the experiment currently . the most difficult part is to fix the central region .",
    "a possible idea may be to fix the central region by hybridizing it to a silicon nanowire or diamond nanowire . once the central region is fixed , it is straight forward to generate the torsional resonator by displacing the edge of the resonator using scanning electron microscope , which has been successfully applied to push the surface graphene layer away from the graphite.@xcite although the torsional resonator is not so easy to be realized with current experimental techniques , it is possible to be produced in the future with the development of the technique and some smart skills from experimentalists .",
    "forgive the detailed technical difficulties in preparing the device , the significant contribution from our work is that we have proposed another theoretical approach to study the quality factor of the nanoresonator .",
    "currently , there is only one md simulation method for the investigation of mechanical resonators.@xcite our method can be used to obtain the pure intrinsic damping mechanism for the nanoresonator , as the quality factor is calculated from an equilibrium md simulation and no mechanical oscillation is generated .",
    "it should be mentioned that we study the intrinsic damping mechanisms for the resonator , which is due to the phonon phonon scattering .",
    "this intrinsic damping mechanism depends on the structure and the interaction of the system .",
    "that is why we can calculate the quality factor from the correlation function of the normal mode coordinate .",
    "the phonon phonon scattering is described by the brenner potential,@xcite which can successfully capture both linear and nonlinear properties of the carbon - based system .",
    "to conclude , we perform md simulation to investigate graphene - based torsional resonators . the quality factor is calculated by @xmath73 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the frequency and life time of the torsional vibration . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are obtained from the correlation function of the normal mode coordinate . as a result of the boundary effect , the quality factor is small and has a maximum value for resonator with proper radius .",
    "the maximum quality factor is achieved with smaller radius at higher temperature resulting from the interplay between boundary effect and the phonon - phonon scattering .",
