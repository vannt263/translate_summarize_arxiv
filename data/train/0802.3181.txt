    "shot noise is defined as the temporal fluctuation of electric current in a non - equilibrium set - up  @xcite . when the shot noise cross - correlations between two regions turn positive it signals the presence of electronic entangled states  @xcite .",
    "in order to make use of these correlations for quantum information purposes one would need to spatially separate the electrons without destroying the entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this is ideally detected by entangled electrons traversing different wires  @xcite .",
    "the quantum correlations can be provided by cooper pairs present in superconductors , which is the most entangled state found in nature .    to intuitively understand how shot noise contains the signature of entanglement we resort to statistics . shot noise cross - correlations are defined as cross - correlations of current fluctuations across two distinct regions .",
    "absence of entanglement leads to positive correlations for photons ( bunching ) and negative for electrons ( anti - bunching ) .",
    "the observation of positive shot noise correlations for electrons is a signature that they are in an entangled state .",
    "this has been most famously predicted in normal metal - superconductor - normal metal structures  @xcite , but it has not yet been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "an earlier experimental attempt  @xcite in a two dimensional electron gas beam splitter connected to a superconductor could not arrive at any definite conclusion possibly due to the low tunability of these devices . in this work",
    "we investigate what happens to the noise cross - correlations when a single layer of graphene replaces the normal metal or semiconductor .",
    "our motivation comes from the following fact .",
    "in contrast to a normal metal , the energy of transported electrons can be very efficiently controlled in a graphene layer via the application of a gate voltage thus being much more amenable to experiments .",
    "this was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the josephson current could be very efficiently tuned via the application of a small gate voltage .",

    "one very interesting fact , which is partly seen in ns graphene junctions , is that , just like the specular andreev reflection seen there , here too the crossed specular andreev reflection is reduced to vanishing at @xmath86 , but the normal crossed andreev current is marginally reduced at @xmath87 .",
    "however , the non - local conductance ( see fig .  [ car - scar ] ) , is dominated by electron co - tunnelling .",

    "that we first have to derive an expression for the shot noise in multi - terminal settings  @xcite applied to graphene .",
    "the fluctuations of the current away from the average is termed noise .",

    "both non - local currents vanish leading to vanishing noise cross - correlations .",

    "we provide the results of noise cross - correlation spectra as a function of gate voltage for a nisin graphene junction . the fano factor ( not presented here )",
    "is also on predictable lines and shows a spike in case of enhanced positive noise cross - correlations , indicating bunching .",
    "we point out the novel phenomena of specular crossed andreev reflection , which enhances noise cross - correlations .",
    "the settings envisaged in this work are experimentally accessible .",
    "a typical s - wave superconductor like aluminium has a coherence length of @xmath115 .",
    "since the proximity effect induces superconducting correlations in graphene , an aluminium superconductor on top of the graphene layer would give rise to a similar correlation length .",
    "this separation would not be a challenge since crossed andreev reflection measurements are carried out routinely at less than these lengths .",
    "further , the superconducting gap in aluminium is @xmath116 , while the typical fermi energy in normal doped graphene is around @xmath117 . in our study",
    "we have considered for certain situations @xmath118 , i.e. , @xmath119 , which corresponds to undoped graphene , while @xmath120 can be tuned via doping graphene .",
    "these values are realistic and thus obviate any reasons for scepticism . employing these entangled states for quantum information processing will increase the allure of graphene .",
