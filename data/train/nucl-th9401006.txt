    "heavy  ion reactions of intermediate energies up to a few gev / u offer the unique possibility to produce chunks of nuclear matter of densities of 2  3 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is predicted by various models @xcite that at these densities first effects from the restauration of chiral symmetry , one of the fundamental symmetries of qcd , should appear . in particular ,",
    "a lowering of the masses of the vector mesons has been predicted @xcite that could possibly be observed in measurements of dilepton spectra . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have investigated the observable consequences of such changes .    in this paper",
    "we study the elementary production process for dileptons in nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions , since the quantitative understanding of this process is the natural prerequisite to an unequivocal determination of the in  medium effects mentioned above .",
    "we also point out that the study of this process may give fundamental information on the electromagnetic formfactor of the nucleon in the timelike region around the vector meson masses that is otherwise not accessible @xcite .    for the production of photons",
    "the relevant cross sections were presented in @xcite .",
    "similar calculations were performed for dileptons , but the effect of resonances was neglected @xcite . in ref.@xcite calculations quite similar to our calculations for the nucleon contribution to the cross section were performed but there only back  to  back pairs of the dileptons were considered , because in this case the phasespace for the nucleons can be integrated out in an analytic way . the cross section obtained in this way",
    "was assumed to be also valid for dileptons that are not back  to  back pairs .    in chapter 2 we will shortly present our general calculational procedure based on an effective obe  interaction where all the parameters are determined by fitting the elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering data and the nn@xmath3 n@xmath4 reaction . using this set of parameters in chapter 3 our results for dilepton production will be presented .",
    "since all hadrons have an electromagnetic structure , we have to include formfactors in our calculation , too . how it is possible to do this without loosing gauge invariance is shown in subsection 1 of chapter 3 . in the last subsection of chapter 3 we present the results of our calculations using the parameters found in chapter two .",
    "the conclusion in chapter four will end our paper .",
    "to obtain the desired production cross sections we use covariant perturbation theory in first order in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "particles are simply produced from the external nucleon lines or , if possible , from the internal meson lines ( fig .",
    "particle emission between subsequent nn interaction vertices are omitted in our calculation scheme , but we include the more important effects of excited @xmath1-resonances .    to determine all the parameters involved in our calculation we need as an essential input the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "in contrast to some iterative scheme we directly fit the @xmath5-matrix by an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction based on an one - boson - exchange model . for lab energies up to 400 mev such fits were performed , using up to 16 mesons @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the most essential four mesons for fitting elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering data for lab energies in the range from 800 mev up to 3 gev .",
    "for these four mesons we use the following hamiltonian : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the scalar , vector , isovector - vector and isovector - pseudoscalar fields , respectively , of the four mesons .    from the pion - nucleon interaction",
    "the nn potential @xmath9 can be deduced .",
    "one feature of this potential is that for @xmath10 , i.e. for the forward direction in the direct diagrams and the backward direction in the exchange diagrams , the scattering amplitude vanishes ; this leads to an unreasonable shape of the elastic scattering cross section . to avoid this",
    ", we first decompose the potential eq.([pionpotential1 ] ) into the sum of a tensor part and a central part . after a fourier - transformation of the central part",
    "we get the well - known yukawa - interaction and an additional contact term @xcite . @xmath11",
    "it is the contact term that causes the unphysical behaviour in the angular distribution . in nature",
    "this term is effectively turned off by the repulsive hard core of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction , but in our scheme it has to be explicitly subtracted .",
    "this is achieved by adding the following hamiltonian : @xmath12 since @xmath13 eq.([contactterm ] ) describes the interaction of the nucleons via a very heavy axialvector ",
    "isovector meson . for high bombarding energies and inelastic nucleon - nucleon processes this interaction generates additional terms besides the desired @xmath14-force in coordinate space , but these are of minor importance in comparison to the influence of the @xmath14-force",
    "2 shows clearly the improvement obtained when using the contact term eq.([contactterm ] ) in addition to a pion - potential .    to take into account the finite size of the nucleons we introduce formfactors @xmath15 at each strong - interaction vertex where @xmath16 is the four - momentum and @xmath17 the mass of the exchanged meson .    at total",
    "we have eight parameters which have to be determined by elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering data . in an effective interaction scheme",
    "it is not possible to reproduce all the data in the desired energy range from 800 mev up to 3 gev with energy independent parameters .",
    "therefore we have kept the four cutoffs @xmath18 energy independent and use for each meson a coupling constant which depends on the total c.m . energy @xmath19    with these 12 parameters",
    "@xmath20 given in table 1 we fit the @xmath5-matrix to the relevant pp and pn data at three different laboratory energies 1.73 , 2.24 and 3.18 gev for proton - proton and proton - neutron scattering . in fig .",
    "3 we show the results of our calculations using these parameters in comparison with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "note that the 800 mev - data ( fig",
    ". 3 top ) were not included in our fit procedure . from this comparison",
    "we conclude that the elastic amplitudes are quite well described .",
    "we then assume that the nn ",
    "meson vertices determined by the procedure just described are correct also for half  off  shell processes .",
    "as already mentioned , for particle production in the energy region we are interested in , it is necessary to include higher resonances . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the implementation of the @xmath1 .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the particle production involving the @xmath1 always look like the process @xmath21 and the decay of this @xmath1 into a nucleon and the desired particle ( pion or dilepton pair ) . due to isospin conservation",
    "only isospin-1-mesons can be exchanged ; in our calculation these are the pion and the rho - meson .",
    "the corresponding vertex functions are : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the momentum of the outgoing meson and @xmath24 the isospin - operator . from the decay @xmath25 we have determined the @xmath26coupling constant to @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath1 propagator @xcite is : @xmath28    concerning this propagator there is a some confusion in the literature , ref.@xcite used @xmath29 in the projector part of the propagator instead of @xmath30 .",
    "this , however , leads to an unreasonable behaviour , since the projector develops a pole for off - shell @xmath1 s with @xmath31 , which shows up as a pole in the differential cross section for pion production .",
    "the mass of the @xmath1 in the denominator is modified by an imaginary width @xmath32 due to the fact that @xmath1 s are not stable particles .",
    "nonrelativistic calculations of the @xmath1 selfenergy lead to a @xmath33 dependence of the width @xcite where @xmath34 is the pion momentum in the rest frame of the @xmath1 .",
    "we take @xcite @xmath35 ^ 3                     \\frac{k^2(m_\\delta^2 ) + \\kappa^2 }                          { k^2(\\mu^2 )       + \\kappa^2 } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "k(\\mu^2 ) & = & \\sqrt { \\frac { ( \\mu^2+m_n^2-m_\\pi^2)^2 }                           { 4\\mu^2 } - m^2_n } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the mass of an off - shell @xmath1 .",
    "the constant @xmath37 is the free width of 0.12 gev and @xmath38 is fixed to 0.16 gev .    as in the case of nucleon - nucleon scattering ( [ strongformfactor ] )",
    "we use formfactors for the nucleon@xmath1 vertex but now of dipole form @xcite in order to keep the self  energy of the nucleon finite ( a monopole formfactor would not change any of the results reported below if we use a somewhat smaller cut  off ) . @xmath39 the three new parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are fitted to the existing data @xcite for mass - differential cross sections for @xmath21 in the energy range 1 - 2.5 gev . for the calculation of the @xmath1-production",
    "we take also into account the decay width of the @xmath1 by multiplying @xmath43 to the cross section obtained from the feynman diagram .    in a fit to experimental data of @xmath44 at 3 energies ( 970 mev , 1.48 gev , 2.02 gev ) we have obtained @xmath45 we have found that in this case a good fit could be obtained already without a @xmath46dependence , except at the highest energy .",
    "the results of our fits in comparison to the experimental data @xcite at 0.970 , 1.48 and 2.02 gev are shown in fig .",
    "up to 2.0 gev we have found a destructive interference between @xmath47- and @xmath48-meson , above 2.0 gev there is a constructive interference .",
    "we then conclude that now also the @xmath49meson vertices are determined ; as for the case of the nn ",
    "meson vertices we assume them to be correct also for half  off  shell  processes .    in order to check this hypothesis",
    "we perform calculations for the pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions as a first test to verify our potentials .",
    "we compare our calculations with experimental data for five  times  differential cross sections for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows good agreement between experimental data and our calculation .    for smaller energies the fitted coupling constant are not very energy dependent .",
    "we thus used the coupling for 800 mev also for smaller energies ( 400 mev  800 mev ) . with these parameters",
    "we also reproduce the total cross sections for elastic nucleon  nucleon scattering within 20% .",
    "we take this as a justifaction to calculate with these parameters also the total cross sections for the @xmath50 process for lower energies .",
    "figure 6 shows that we get a good agreement with experiment ( experimental data are taken from @xcite ) . using only feynman graphs with propagating @xmath1 we",
    "get much too low cross sections for small energies ; there the production over the nucleon pole is obviously very important .",
    "after having convinced ourselves in the last section that the effective obe model gives a good description of elastic scattering and pion production amplitudes , we now use the interaction vertices determined there for a calculation of dilepton production in elementary nucleon  nucleon collisions . in this calculation",
    "we first neglect any electromagnetic formfactors of the nucleons and determine the coupling constant @xmath51 from the @xmath52decay branch of the @xmath1 .",
    "the vertex function for this process is : @xmath53 where @xmath16 is the momentum of the photon in this case .",
    "the coupling constant has been obtained from the experimental partial width of the @xmath1 of 0.6% for the decay into a real photon .",
    "we also include the coupling to the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "a consequence of this is that now also the neutron lines can contribute to the radiation of dileptons .",
    "both the @xmath1 resonance and the radiation from neutron lines were not included in our earlier calculations @xcite nor in those of haglin et al . @xcite . that the latter becomes more important for higher photon - energies",
    "was already found in our calculations of real bremsstrahlung @xcite .    figs . 7 and 8 show the invariant mass spectra for dilepton production both for pp and pn collisions at the two bombarding energies 1.0 and 2.1 gev . in all cases",
    "the dominant contribution arises from the resonance amplitude where the intermediate , off - shell particle is a @xmath1 ; in fact the total yield is almost equal to the contribution of the @xmath1 amplitude alone .",
    "the pn amplitude is for these graphs about a factor 2  3 larger than for the pp reactions ; this factor is mainly determined by different isospin factors .",
    "the graphs involving only intermediate nucleon lines are for the pn reactions significantly larger than for pp ( factors 6 and 4 at 1 and 2.1 gev , respectively ) .",
    "this is due to the destructive interference between the radiation from both particle in the case of pp scattering .",
    "the total yield from pn is larger than that from pp by only about a factor of 4 at 1 gev and a factor of 2.5 at 2.1 gev ( both at @xmath54 gev ) .    at first sight the mass - spectra of the nucleon graphs and the @xmath1 graphs alone",
    "look very similar .",
    "however , a closer inspection shows that that at 1 gev both merge at the high end of the mass spectrum .",
    "in this situation a sizeable interference of both contributions also takes place . note also that the increase of the bombarding energy leads to a hardening of the spectra , but not to an increase of the value at small @xmath55 .    in a first comparison with experimental data",
    "we now look at the latest results of the bevalac group@xcite for the ratio of the pd to pp  dilepton yield . in fig .",
    "9 we show this ratio for lab energies from 1.03 gev up to 4.9 gev , the experimental data@xcite and the results of our calculations ( solid line ) .",
    "the calculation for the deuteron was performed by summing incoherently over the total pn and pp cross sections .",
    "since our model gives the correct scattering amplitudes only up to 3.0 gev we omit the calculation for 4.9 gev and show the data for completeness only .",
    "it is seen that the calculation reproduces the general trend of the @xmath56 ratio very well . in particular",
    "it is able to describe the absolute value of the ratio as well as its mass - dependence correctly ; also the rise with @xmath55 towards the kinematical limit at the lower bombarding energies is obtained , although maybe somewhat too small ( at 1.26 gev )",
    ".    a closer inspection of the reasons for this behavior shows that we get a destructive interference between the nucleon and the @xmath1contributions for the pp reaction which in the high mass region is as large as the nucleon contribution ( see fig .",
    "78 ) , the largest one there . for the pn reaction at the kinematical limit",
    "we obtain also a destructive interference which is as large as the in the pp case , but for all invariant masses smaller than the largest of the individual contributions by at least a factor 23 so that it has virtually no effect in the pn case .",
    "figure 10 shows the results of the calculation , together with data , for the @xmath57 reaction @xcite .",
    "note that for this comparison we have made the assumption that all dileptons are radiated incoherently and that none of the @xmath1 s are reabsorbed before they can emit a dilepton pair .",
    "this means that the cross sections from pn as well as pp  scattering are summed up , weighted by the number of neutrons or protons in the nucleus , respectively .",
    "the efficiency of the detector is included in the integration over the phasespace ",
    "volume by using the latest filter ",
    "routine from the dls collaboration@xcite .",
    "we use the same filter for all the various dilepton  sources .",
    "below 300 mev invariant mass of the dilepton pair the filter can decrease the yield by factors of two or three ; in this energy range we fail to describe the data .",
    "in particular , we can not describe the dip in the data around 150 mev .    while we overestimate the data at 1 gev we obtain good agreement at 2.1 gev , except for invariant masses around the @xmath58mass ( see fig .",
    "10 ) , where the calculated values are somewhat too low .",
    "note also that the 2.1 gev data contain a contribution from @xmath59dalitz decay ; we take this contribution from ref.@xcite .",
    "while the resonance terms give the largest contributions for the elementary process , their influence may be overestimated when scaling this cross section up to the experimental case of @xmath57 , because of a possible reabsorption of the @xmath1 by another nucleon before emitting the virtual photon , the pauli  blocking of the final state and possible shadowing effects .",
    "a comparison of our calculations with experiments on the elementary process @xmath60 would be free of such uncertainties .",
    "besides the contribution from bremsstrahlung , our calculation also includes dilepton production from the charged internal meson lines ( fig .",
    "for this internal radiation , from the pions , for example , we could use the experimentally well established electromagnetic formfactor of the pion @xcite which then would lead to an enhancement of the cross section just in the region of the @xmath58mass .",
    "this procedure , however , is not gauge  invariant , since current conservation requires @xmath61 so that at a first sight the nucleons must have the same electromagnetic structure as the pions .",
    "thus we are lead to the strong vmd hypothesis , i.e. all hadrons couple to photons by an intermediate @xmath58meson . the dipole shape of the spacelike electromagnetic formfactor of the nucleon shows that this is too strong a restriction .",
    "this section shows how to keep gauge invariance with different formfactors for the various hadrons .",
    "the problem of losing gauge invariance when using electromagnetic formfactors arises because we have so far not used the complete vertex function for the half ",
    "off  shell photon production vertices .",

    "in the case of charged meson exchange , however , the four - momentum of the meson changes in diagram 1c . this change can be taken into account by an additional factor in eq.([diagram3 ] ) @xcite : @xmath87 which can be interpreted as the radiation of photons by the heavy cutoff - particles which carry the same quantum numbers as the corresponding meson .    in @xcite",
    "the same result is obtained in a different way . there",
    "the strong interaction formfactors and the free meson propagator are used together as an effective meson propagator .",

    "thus from this way of gauging the strong formfactors it is evident that there is the possibility to use a given electromagnetic formfactor for the meson and a different one for the nucleon and still to fulfil the wti .",

    "the region @xmath93 is for the nucleons not accessible in any on  shell experiment ; this is unfortunate since this is just the interesting region that includes the vector  meson masses and is thus crucial for establishing the validity of vector meson dominance for the nucleon .    in order to test the sensitivity of our results to the formfactors of the nucleon we use two different models . in the first we extrapolate the model of ref.@xcite , which gives an excellent fit in the space - like domain , into the timelike region . in that model",
    "the formfactor arises from the meson cloud surrounding the quark core as well as from the core itself .",

    "we take for simplicity the same formfactor @xmath95 as for the nucleon .    in the second model we use the same formfactor as for the pion ( [ pionformfactor ] ) also for the nucleon and the @xmath1 .",
    "this would correspond to strict vector meson dominance .    by adding to the masses and cutoffs a typical width of 100150 mev we avoid the pole structure of these formfactors and make the latter complex .",
    "note , however , that this procedure does not include any imaginary parts resulting from other possible decay channels .",
    "our results depend especially in the pole region on the value we take for the width , but if we believe in vmd this width should not be too different from the width of the rho  meson . the formfactors for the pion and nucleon",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "note that the model of ref.@xcite exhibits a strange structure in @xmath77 and @xmath95 in the high mass region , which may simply indicate that this model has been extrapolated beyond its limits of validity .    in order to get a feeling for the influence of the formfactors on the spectra we now make two assumptions , namely that first these formfactors can also be applied to the half ",

    "10 ) again .    in the region of interest , @xmath55 = 600 mev or higher",
    ", there is no contribution from the @xmath99-decay .",
    "thus it might be possible to extract an estimate for the hadronic formfactors from the existing data . in fig .",
    "12 the dotted line corresponds to our calculation without any formfactor ; it underestimates the data in the mass region around 600 mev by about a factor of 3 .",
    "8 shows that the contribution of the propagating @xmath1 provides the dominant amplitude for this process . by using the formfactors ( from ref.@xcite ) we now would overestimate the data drastically in the meson mass region between 600 and 700 mev ( dashed line in fig .",
    "if we use the strict vmd formfactors we obtain the dashed curve which shows a shoulder - like structure which is not seen in the data .",
    "these results show that the cross section for the production of dileptons of high invariant mass in nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions is very sensitive to the electromagnetic formfactors of the nucleon and the @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that the calculations with the formfactors included overestimate the measured cross section in the vector meson mass region and that the data - within their present accurracy - do not show any indication of an enhancement in the vector meson mass region might have several reasons .",
    "first , neglecting the half - off - shell corrections may not be correct , second , our setting @xmath100 may not be justified and , third , unitarity constraints may play a role so that the formfactors really are complex in this region .",
    "in this paper have presented calculations of the cross sections for dilepton production in nucleon - nucleon collisions in a relativistic scheme . as a major input for all these calculations a covariant amplitude based on an one  boson  exchange  model",
    "was presented , which allows to describe experimental data for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for lab energies from 800 mev up to 2.5 gev and also works well for pion production .",
    "we have then used the vertices so determined in a calculation of the elementary dilepton production cross section and have discussed how to include different electromagnetic formfactors for the hadrons while maintaining gauge invariance whatever theoretical model for these formfactors we insert .",
    "in this framework we can describe the latest data on dilepton production in pd and pp reactions , both in their absolute magnitude and in their trends .",
    "earlier data for @xmath103 can also be described reasonably well , although here discrepancies remain , mainly at the lowest energy .",
    "we have then shown the importance of the electromagnetic formfactors of the hadrons for the dilepton production in nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleus collisions .",
    "these reactions are a unique tool to study the electromagnetic formfactor of the nucleons in the timelike region around the vector - meson masses and are thus essential to check the validity of vector - meson dominance directly , at least for the half - off - shell formfactors . in view of the adhoc nature of the formfactors",
    "used here this can presently be only an explorative study which , however , points to the need to include the half - off - shell effects of the electromagnetic formfactors and their imaginary parts in the calculations .",
    "precise data on the elementary process would clearly help to put constraints on these formfactors .",
    "in particular experiments are necessary where also the hadrons in the final state are detected . only in these experiments",
    "it might be possible to disentangle all the various contributions coming from pre- or postemission diagrams , from nucleon- or @xmath1 contribution and from direct- or exchange - diagrams .",
