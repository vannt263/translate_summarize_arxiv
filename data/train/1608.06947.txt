    "polarimetry can provide a unique probe of x - ray binaries , since ( 1 ) we can obtain information on the geometrical property of the binary system from the light scattered by circumstellar matter ( stellar wind and/or an accretion disc ) at a scale not accessible to present imaging techniques or ( 2 ) information on jets ( e.g. , geometry , magnetic field , electron energy ) from the synchrotron emission .",
    "a significant fraction of the optical emission in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) is produced by the accretion disc surrounding the compact object .",
    "the accretion disc is heated by x - rays originating near the central source and hydrogen is completely ionized in the entire disc @xcite .",
    "therefore , optical linear polarization at the few per cent level caused by thomson scattering of the emitted radiation with the free electrons in the disc is expected at these wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the polarization due to the scattering of intrinsically unpolarized thermal emission can be modulated on the orbital period , which places constraints on the physical and geometrical properties of the system @xcite .    in lmxbs , there is also one emission mechanism that intrinsically produces polarized light ",

    "in table[table : results ] we give the near - ir polarization results obtained for v404cyg  and in fig.[fig : ppa ] we plot the near - ir @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 for v404cyg  and other stars in the field - of - view .",

    "during the 2015 outburst of v404cyg  there were a number of linear polarization measurements taken at different times which have very similar @xmath8-band polarization values ; @xmath28 per cent on jun 17 @xcite , 7.5@xmath20 on jun 18 @xcite and 7.7@xmath210.1 per cent on jun 18 and jun 19 @xcite , 7.8 per cent on jun 20 @xcite .",
    "all latter measurements have almost identical values , suggesting that it is most likely the constant level of the interstellar polarization .",
    "we also find that the @xmath8-band polarization level we measure in quiescence ( table[table : results ] ) is very similar to these values , which further suggests that this polarization level of 78 per cent is not due to some intrinsic origin present only during outburst .",
    "v404cyg  has a dust extinction of @xmath224.4 @xcite so interstellar optical polarization is expected .",
    "a linear relation between the maximum optical polarization caused by interstellar dust @xcite implies a polarization level of @xmath23 per cent for v404cyg , which is consistent with the observed 78 per cent .    in one case ,",
    "variable optical polarization was reported in v404cyg  during its outburst @xcite which implies that part of the optical polarization is due to an intrinsic , variable component , most likely from synchrotron radiation from a jet ( see section[sec : disc ] ) .",
    "an intrinsic component arising from the accretion disc is also likely to be present , but this is expected to be very low , at the 1 per cent level * ? ? ?",
    "* . therefore , given the high extinction , the polarization of v404cyg  determined when the source is in quiescence , represents the dust component along the light - of - sight .    to determine the dust component we fit the optical and near - ir polarization measurements with the interstellar dust model .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the interstellar polarization ( due to aligned dust grains ) can be described empirically using the serkowski law @xcite ; @xmath24\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the percentage polarization at wavelength @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the maximum polarization which occurs at wavelength @xmath28 .",
    "the curve width parameter @xmath29 has been found to be closely related to @xmath28 , with the most recent determination from observations of 105 stars being k=0.01 + 1.66@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we fit the optical and near - ir linear polarization data with the empirical formula of serkowski and find @xmath28=0.30@xmath30@xmath31 m and @xmath32=9.65@xmath210.36 per cent ( see fig.[fig : ispol ] ) .",
    "the optical ( @xmath33 ) and near - ir ( @xmath34 ) position angle is expected to be constant , although there seems to be an offset of @xmath35 between them , which is most likely due to a non - zero near - ir position angle offset ( see section[sec : near - ir ] ) .",
    "the constant position angle with a steep decrease in polarization towards longer wavelengths supports the interstellar origin of the polarization observations taken during quiescence , and near quiescence for the near - ir data .",
    "since the near - ir data fit the interstellar law so well , we find no clear evidence for an additional intrinsic source of polarization in the near - ir data which were taken near the end of the outburst .",
    "to determine the intrinsic @xmath11 and @xmath12 values of v404cyg  during outburst , we subtract the @xmath11 and @xmath12 values obtained from the not @xmath8-band data ( the @xmath36 and @xmath8 central wavelengths are very similar ) from the @xmath0-band @xmath11 and @xmath12 time resolved values of v404cyg  taken during outburst .",
    "fig.[fig : pol ] shows the @xmath0-band , @xmath5 and @xmath6 light curves intrinsic to v404cyg .",
    "as one can see the polarization is variable , with a mean of 3.7 per cent and a variation of from 3.2 to 4.5 per cent , whereas the mean position angle is 171@xmath1 with a variation from 167@xmath1 to 173@xmath1 .",
    "there appears to be a rise , then fall in the level of polarization while the optical flux is relatively steady , followed by a more constant , lower polarization level while the optical flux is rising .",
    "in order to constrain the origin of the polarization flare , we compare its properties to what is expected from possible sources of polarization .",
    "the polarization flare seen in fig.[fig : pol]b decayed fairly smoothly from 4.5 to 3.5 per cent in approximately 20 minutes , and the mean level of polarization before and after the flare differed .",
    "interstellar dust between v404cyg  and the earth has already been subtracted , so the remaining variable polarization must originate within the binary system .",
    "variable ( i.e. moving ) screens of dust or lighter matter _ local to _ the system , perhaps produced by the outburst itself , are unlikely to be the cause of the variable polarization .",
    "a fast , neutral accretion disc wind is produced during the outburst @xcite , but any optical extinction caused by the wind would reduce the flux and redden the optical colour , as well as possibly change the fractional polarization . during the 20-minute polarization flare , the optical flux and colour do not change ( fig.[fig : pol]a and fig.[fig : multi ] ) , so extinction changes can be ruled out .",
    "thompson scattering of thermal , unpolarized photons from the accretion disc could produce variable polarization , but the timescale of variability is expected to be on the orbital period and stronger at bluer wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this has been observed in some x - ray binaries , with a modulation of polarization seen on the orbital period in systems in outburst @xcite and quiescence @xcite . the orbital period of v404cyg  is 6.5 days ; much longer than the timescales of variability we observe , and longer timescale polarization studies during the outburst @xcite have not detected a modulation .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that scattering of unpolarized light causes the variable polarization .",
    "the bright optical flaring seen throughout the outburst of v404cyg   probably has both thermal ( from the accretion disc ) and non - thermal ( synchrotron jet ) components ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "synchrotron jet emission at optical  near - ir wavelengths in x - ray binaries is associated with emission close to the base of the jet , and is found to be highly variable from hour down to sub - second timescales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and polarized , usually at a level of a few per cent @xcite .",
    "jet synchrotron emission is therefore a viable candidate for the variable polarization .",
    "@xcite identify and label various flare events during the outburst of v404cyg .",
    "flare xiii reached a flux level of @xmath240crab , with a peak flux lasting @xmath21.5h that was preceded by a @xmath23h long , 3crab plateau observed only above 13kev . with the exception of two flare events , iv and xiii ,",
    "most of the optical flares show a fast rise ( @xmath21h ) similar to the flares observed in x - rays .",
    "flare events iv and xiii have slower rise times ( about 10 and 4 h , respectively ) , and are both coincident with hard plateaus that precede the x - ray peaks .",
    "an optical and x - ray plateau is observed before a very bright flare .",
    "fig.[fig : multi ] shows the integral jem - x ( 510 kev ) and aavso @xmath9-band light curves of v404cyg  around the time of our tng polarimetry ( mjd57197.12 to 57197.20 ) . as one can see , a huge x - ray flare ( labelled flare xiii in *",
    "* ) was observed with jem - x from mjd57197.15 to 57197.20 , reaching @xmath2 40 crab in flux and during which the hardness ratio decreases .",
    "the top two panels of fig.[fig : multi ] show that the x - ray flux and its hardness ratio ( black dots ) were highly variable , especially soon after the polarization flare .",
    "a bright , prominent radio ( 16 ghz ) flare was observed with the arcminute microkelvin imager large array ( ami - la ) , peaking just a few hours after the optical polarization flare ( ami - la data are from fender et al . in preparation ) .",
    "note that the ami - la does not give polarisation information .",
    "concurrently , the optical flux ( bottom panel ; data from aavso ) brightens to a peak flare a few hours after the polarization flare , and then fades rapidly , with two smooth dips in the light curve and a change in the colour following the flare .",
    "the timing of the polarization flare does not correspond to any specific feature in either the x - ray or optical light curves ; it occurs during the plateau / slow rise of the optical and x - ray fluxes before the brightest flares .",
    "the polarization flare does however occur during the initial stages of the rise of the radio flux .",
    "if the optical synchrotron emission originates near the jet base , and the bright flare at radio wavelengths is predominantly from emission downstream at larger scales further down the jet , then they may be associated with the propagation of one single ejection event .",
    "this is supported by 5 ghz radio data from the e - multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( emerlin ; from fender et al . in preparation ; data not shown here ) which also show a peak in the light curve .",
    "the 16ghz and 5ghz flares peak at @xmath22.0h and @xmath23.8 h respectively , after the @xmath0-band polarization flare .",
    "we first observe the jet base in polarization at optical wavelengths , and then the radio flares , which arise from emission along the jet downstream .",
    "the three flares describe a classically evolving synchrotron flare from an ejection .",
    "this strongly suggests that a jet launching event occured at the time of the polarization flare , and implies that we have discovered the signature of a major ejection being launched , from optical polarization .    the 16 ghz radio flare peaks at a flux density of @xmath37 jy .",
    "the optical magnitude at the time of the polarization flare is @xmath38 , which corresponds to a de - reddened ( assuming @xmath39 ) flux density of 3.8 jy .",
    "the synchrotron emission may contribute a fraction of the flux , and since optically thin synchrotron emission can be up to @xmath40 per cent polarized , the flux density of the synchrotron could be as low as 0.25 jy .",
    "if the optical synchrotron flux density is 0.25  3.8 jy then the spectral index from 16 ghz to @xmath0-band ( at @xmath41 hz ) at the flare peak is @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 ) , consistent with being a flat spectrum .",
    "this is similar to what was found for the near - ir and radio flares of grs 1915 + 105 , in which oscillations in @xmath29-band ( 2.2 @xmath31 m ) and 15 ghz radio ( 2.0 cm ) had similar timescales , morphologies and flux densities @xcite .",
    "continuously launched , hard state jets typically have flat or slightly inverted spectra , that are produced by the overlapping synchrotron spectra of many individual plasma ejections . here",
    ", it appears we are witnessing an individual ejection evolving from optical to radio wavelengths , over a frequency range spanning 4.5 orders of magnitude .",
    "miller - jones et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "present very long baseline array data from the 2015 outburst of v404cyg , showing evidence that the resolved radio jet orientation changes over time .",
    "a preliminary analysis suggests that the position angle of the jet varied between @xmath2 - 16@xmath1 and @xmath2 + 10@xmath1 e of n. for optically thin synchrotron emission , the polarization position angle is parallel to the electric vector and perpendicular to the magnetic field vector .",
    "we measure a rather stable polarization position angle of @xmath2 - 9 @xmath1 e of n from the optical data .",
    "this implies that the electric field vector near the base of the jet in v404cyg  is on average approximately parallel to the jet axis , implying that the magnetic field is orthogonal to the jet axis .",
    "this may be due to the compression of magnetic field lines in shocks in the flow , resulting in a partially ordered transverse field .",
    "@xcite also observed variable linear polarization in v404cygduring its 2015 outburst .",
    "even though they could not determine the absolute value for the polarization , they report changes of 46 per cent over timescales of @xmath21 h during two different epochs .    during several nights within the outburst , @xcite obtained @xmath8-band polarimetry of v404cyg  and several bright stars .",
    "they found that the @xmath8-band @xmath5 and @xmath6 of v404cyg  and the surrounding field stars showed similar levels and direction , respectively .",
    "they also determined the @xmath7 to @xmath17-band polarization and position angle spectrum and concluded that the decrease in polarization towards the infrared with constant positon angle , suggests that the polarization is interstellar in origin .",
    "our broad - band polarimetry also suggests an interstellar dust component dominates the overall polarization spectral energy distribution ( see section[pol_sed ] ) .",
    "however , the fact that we observe a variable component ( as did * ? ? ? * ) , suggests that there is an additional source for the variable polarization , and we argue above that this is most likely due to synchrotron emission from a jet .",
    "@xcite also obtained simultaneous @xmath8- and @xmath17-band light curves on mjd57193 and 57194 that showed very similar structures ; a long plateau of slowly rising flux , followed by a rapid decline in flux .",
    "however , on mjd51793 a @xmath17-band near - ir flare was observed peaking around mjd57193.5 , @xmath22h before the shoulder of the subsequent rapid decline in flux , with no corresponding enhancement in the @xmath8-band .",
    "the observed red colour and short duration of the near - ir flare suggest synchrotron emission from a jet .",
    "indeed , the @xmath17-band peak flux density of the flare reached the same level as the giant radio and sub - mm flares observed by ratan-600 and sma ( sub millimeter array ) on mjd57198.933 and mjd57195.55 , respectively @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the radio flux observed during the giant radio and sub - mm flares extrapolates to the @xmath17-band peak flux density by assuming a flat spectral index .",
    "this is similar to the flat spectrum found between our optical polarization flare and the following radio flare .    during this near - ir flare reported by @xcite , at first glance",
    "the @xmath17-band polarization and position angle does not show any significant temporal variation , indicating that the near - ir emission is not strongly polarized .",
    "however , the errors on the polarization are large , and the @xmath17-band polarization does in fact change from @xmath44 per cent to @xmath45 per cent during the near - ir flare , which is slightly larger than the change in polarization that we detected ( with much higher significance ) from the tng data ( from 4.5 to 3.5 per cent ; see fig.[fig : pol]b ) .",
    "the reason why the near - ir polarization change is not significant is because the errors are large enough that these fluctuations are consistent with the scatter in polarization at other times .",
    "therefore one can not uncover small amplitude flares in the polarization .",
    "we therefore can not rule out a small polarization flare of amplitude @xmath46 per cent being present during the near - ir flux flare observed by @xcite which , if present , would be in line with our results .",
    "however , the low level of @xmath17-band polarization suggests that either the synchrotron emission is optically thin and the magnetic field is predominantly tangled , or that the jet synchrotron emission is in the optically thick regime and the magnetic field is highly ordered .",
    "since no corresponding @xmath8-band flare is observed , the optically thick synchrotron emission perhaps does not extend up to the @xmath8-band .",
    "the fact that we observe a polarized flare in the @xmath0-band , while the optical flux remained steady , suggests that the majority of the optical flux does not originate in the polarized jet component , and that the jet component itself is polarized by a stronger amount than observed .",
    "it could therefore be that the jet synchrotron emission is in the optically thin regime and that the spectral break from optically thick to thin lies between @xmath8 and @xmath17-band ( at a frequency of @xmath47hz ; this is also implied in fig.5 of * ? ? ?",
    "this frequency for the jet spectral break is consistent with that found from data taken during the hard state decay of the 1989 outburst of v404cyg  ( @xmath48 hz ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite show that there are significant periods of repetitive optical variations during the 2015 outburst of v404cyg .",
    "for example , the optical light curves taken on mjd57197 ( see fig.[fig : multi ] ) , 57193 and 57194 @xcite show very similar structures ; a long plateau before a rapid decline in flux .",
    "however , on mjd51793 a @xmath49-band flare was observed peaking around mjd57193.5 , @xmath22h before the shoulder of the subsequent rapid decline in flux , with no corresponding enhancement in the @xmath8-band .",
    "the near - ir flare suggests at least two processes are responsible for the optical  near - ir emission .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite , who discovered remarkable , high amplitude sub - second optical flaring on one date ; 26 june .",
    "these rapid flares had a red spectrum and were interpreted as originating from optically thin synchrotron emission from the compact jet ; the same as @xcite concluded for the origin of the near - ir flare .",
    "the polarization flare seen with tng , and the near - ir flare reported by @xcite both occured during the rise of a bright optical and 3crab x - ray plateau that precedes a very bright flare ( see fig.[fig : multi ] ) .    in fig.[fig : overlap ] we show the aavso and @xcite optical light curves centred on three events : the optical polarization flare reported here ( black pluses ; zero is mjd 57197.142 ) , the near - ir flux flare seen by @xcite ( green crosses ; mjd 57193.543 ) and the time of the rapid red flares seen by @xcite ( red crosses ; mjd 57199.215 ) .",
    "it is clear that all three events occurred during a steady , slow rise of the flux ( i.e. , the plateau ) before some of the brightest flares of the outburst . in the case of the polarization flare and the near - ir flare , the two happened almost exactly 2 hours before a rapid drop in the optical flux , in fact the shape of the rise and drop are very similar on the two dates .",
    "since all three events are associated with core jet activity , we conclude that ejections are produced at this specific stage of the flaring cycles of v404cyg  during its 2015 outburst .",
    "in addition , some of the brightest radio and mm flares , which trace the large scale jet emission , occurred simultaneously with the brightest optical and x - ray flares , @xcite , further implying that single ejection events are being produced during the flare rises .",
    "this is certainly the case for the optical polarization flare ( fig.[fig : multi ] ) .",
    "one possible interpretation follows .",
    "the 3-crab x - ray plateau during which the polarization flare is detected , could be associated with many smaller ejections ( a more continuous jet ) , and would therefore be associated with more shocks in the jet ejecta close to the core .",
    "evidence of the launching of many small ejections comes from the rapid optically thin flares detected also during a plateau stage by @xcite .",
    "the polarization flare ( and possibly the near - ir flare seen by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could signify compression of the magnetic field due to many small shocks in the jet during this plateau .",
    "this naturally explains the polarization position angle observed , which is consistent with a shock compressed magnetic field perpendicular to the jet axis , like the high polarization observed in downstream shocks in agn jets , and the high radio polarization in x - ray binaries from discrete ejecta / shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this interpretation , the polarization flare signifies the birth of a major ejection event caused by an intermittent outflow and resulting in a prominent radio flare .",
    "this is not dissimilar to what has been seen in the past in grs1915 + 105 ( see for example fig.4 of * ? ? ?",
    "we find :    * that the optical to near - ir linear polarization spectrum can be described by interstellar dust and an intrinsic variable component * that the intrinsic optical polarization , detected during the rise of one of the brightest flares of the outburst , is variable , peaking at 4.5 per cent and decaying to 3.5 per cent * that we favour a synchrotron jet origin to this variable polarization , with the optical emission originating close to the jet base * that the 16ghz and 5ghz flares peak at @xmath22 h and @xmath24 h respectively , after the @xmath0-band polarization flare , which is consistent with a classically evolving synchrotron flare from an ejection .    we conclude that we have witnessed a plasma ejection evolving over 4.5 orders of magnitude in frequency , from optical to radio , and that the optical polarization flare represents a jet launching event ; the birth of a major ejection . for this event",
    "we measure a rather stable polarization position angle of @xmath2 - 9 @xmath1 e of n from the optical data .",
    "this implies that the electric field vector near the base of the jet in v404cyg  is on average approximately parallel to the jet axis , implying that the magnetic field is orthogonal to the jet axis .",
    "this may be due to the compression of magnetic field lines in shocks in the flow , resulting in a partially ordered transverse field .",
    "we also find that this ejection occured at a similar stage in the repetitive cycles of flares , as other indicators of jet launching found previously : rapid sub - second optical flaring , and excess near - infared emission .",
