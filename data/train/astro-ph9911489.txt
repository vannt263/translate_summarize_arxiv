    "first - order phase transition ( pt1 ) is characterized by density jump from @xmath0 to @xmath1 with @xmath2 , at some pressure @xmath3 pt1 leads to density discontinuity inside the star while pressure is continious across boundary between phases .",
    "also continious are gravity- and pressure - induced forces inside the star . here",
    "we review some results of studying such stars get mainly ( but _ not _ only ) by author .",
    "there are three main methods of star s equilibrium and stability analysis :    * static criterion ( mass - central pressure dependence ) * dynamical principle ( pulsation frequency ) * variational ( energetic ) principle ( variation of total energy ) .    stability loss / restoration ( critical equilibrium states ) according to these methods are defined as follows :    * mass extremum , @xmath4 * zero frequency of pulsation ( of the lowest mode ) , @xmath5 * equilibrium energy extremum , @xmath6    in fig.1 two first principles are shown qualitatively .",
    "unstable equilibrium states are shown by broken line .",
    "here are some general results in ntg for stars with pt1 :    * at @xmath7 , stability loss occurs at @xmath8 for _ any _ eos , while _ recover _ of stability for larger @xmath9 depends on eos * at @xmath10 , stability loss occurs only at @xmath11 ; @xmath12 are adiabatic and polytropic indices .",

    "+ the larger size of neutral core , the larger value of @xmath22 +    e.g.,@xmath23      inverse @xmath24-decay reactions in dense degenerate matter of white dwarf stars lead to nuclei transformations @xmath25 ( `` @xmath26 '' ) , and to density jump with @xmath27 .",
