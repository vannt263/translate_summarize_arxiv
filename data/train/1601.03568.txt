    "the interatomic interactions in a liquid are strong , yet the structure is disordered which substantially hampers calculations of the phononic properties .",
    "it is noteworthy , perturbation theories and their analytic expressions which bear `` small parameters '' such as virial expansion , percus - yevick approach , meyer expansion and others may describe systems with weak interactions only .",
    "thus , perturbation theories fail to describe systems with strong interactions like compressed / rigid liquids . as a result , both dynamic ( see fig .",
    "( [ corr].a ) ) and structural ( ( see fig . ( [ corr].b ) ) crossovers , which we revealed and interconnected in this work , have not been observed before . here ,",
    "the presented experimental and md simulations results are explained within the framework of unified phonon - based approach @xcite where the problem of strong interactions is tackled from the outset ( see eq .",

    "the appearance of the high - frequency transverse phononic gaps in structurally simple system such as liquid ar is an unexpected result .",
    "the origin of this result was revealed by studying the evolution of correlation functions within the green - kubo formalism .",
    "the velocity - velocity autocorrelation function has an oscillatory component of motion ( picosecond scale ) while the @xmath9 possesses medium - range correlations ( 0.2 - 1.4 nm ) above the frenkel line . upon crossing it",
    ", the oscillatory component vanishes and the motions become purely ballistic ( see fig .",
    "( [ corr].a ) ) and , at the same time , the medium - range pair correlations disappear ( [ corr].b ) ) triggering the high - frequency phononic gaps at the thz scale .",
    "the unveiled regimes of phononic propagation and localization effects in liquid ar and the existence of both low- and high - frequency phononic gaps at thz scale support the forthcoming developments of sound control and heat management through phononic gaps manipulations at meso- and nanoscales . in particular , the phononic gap manipulation can be realized by immersing nanoparticles ( with directional bonds between them ) in liquids and aqueous solutions of interest @xcite .",
    "tuning size , shape and material of the nano - blocks is the key factor for the emerging technology of phononic harvesting nano - clusters and for the phononic gaps engineering with controllable sound output .",

    "<S> in this paper we present inelastic x - ray scattering experiments in a diamond anvil cell and molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the behavior of phononic excitations in liquid ar . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra calculated using molecular dynamics were found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we observe , that upon the temperature increase , a low - frequency transverse phononic gap emerges while high - frequency propagating modes become evanescent at the thz scale . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of strong localization of a longitudinal phononic mode in the supercritical phase is observed for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence for the high - frequency transverse phononic gap due to the transition from an oscillatory to a ballistic dynamic regimes of motion is presented and supported by molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this transition takes place across the frenkel line thermodynamic limit which demarcates compressed liquid and non - compressed fluid domains on the phase diagram and supported through calculations within the green - kubo phenomenological formalism . </S>",
    "<S> these results are crucial to advance the development of novel terahertz thermal devices , phononic lenses , mirrors , and other thz metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> + * d.bolmatov@gmail.com , @xmath0 zherne@bnl.gov    liquid aggregation phase results from a combination of strong interactions and cohesive states as in solids , and large flow - enabling particle displacements as in gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sound propagates well in liquids in the form of longitudinal phonons , however it was not evident whether transverse phonons ( which propagate in solids ) also exist in liquids @xcite . in a recent study </S>",
    "<S> a link was established between the positive sound dispersion ( psd ) effect @xcite , also called the _ fast or second sound _ , and the origin of high - frequency transverse phononic excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both these effects can be considered as a universal fingerprint of the high - frequency dynamic response of a liquid . </S>",
    "<S> each phonon mode contributes to the internal energy and heat capacity @xcite , hence , it is important to know how many phononic states exist in a liquid of interest . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , further advances in manipulation of individual phononic states in liquids and liquid - based devices is limited by the lack of knowledge about the number of allowed states and phononic localization / delocalization effects in these systems . despite recent advancements made in the development of phononic technologies such as topological fluid acoustics @xcite , microfluidics @xcite , hypersound phononics @xcite and phononics in colloid - based systems at ghz scale @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of the phononic states evolution in liquids at thz scale is still elusive .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present the results of inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) experiment in a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) combined with molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations that unveil the localization and delocalization effects in a structurally simple system , the monatomic liquid ar . </S>",
    "<S> the synergy between experiment and computer simulations provided several advantages including but not limited to : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ the possibility of circumventing resolution limitations , which potentially expands the probed dynamic range toward longer distances and timescales ; _ ii ) _ the opportunity of discriminating the acoustic polarizations ; _ iii ) _ the possibility of exploring extreme thermodynamic conditions practically unattainable experimentally . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> an analytical model which predicts a low - frequency transverse phononic gaps and their evolution as a function of temperature is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts both low- and high - frequency transverse phononic gaps in liquid ar that are primarily associated with dynamic and structural changes on short and intermediate length scales ( @xmath10.2 - 1.4 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction was confirmed through calculation of correlation functions in the framework of a phenomenological linear response theory , namely the green - kubo formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data are consistent with md simulations and confirm the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of low - frequency transverse phononic gaps is a result of symmetry breaking due to the interaction of phonons that can be created or annihilated making materials _ anharmonic _ over the heat production . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that high - frequency phononic gaps ( both transverse and longitudinal ) appear on picosecond time scale at elevated temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this point is of particular relevance , since the manipulation of phononic gaps in the so called phononic crystals @xcite is usually achieved through structural engineering . </S>",
    "<S> this is of crucial importance to implement heat management , since heat transfer in insulators uses phonons as carriers . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the phononic gap manipulation can be achieved even in simplest materials through a suitable tuning of thermodynamic conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects into a tuning of the atomic dynamics and structure . </S>",
    "<S> these can be monitored either through the evolution of the velocity - velocity autocorrelation function or the pair distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> tuning of the atomic dynamics and thermally triggered localization of low- and high - frequency propagating phononic modes are the key factors for the advancement of technologies based on the sound control and manipulation at the thz regime . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that our findings will advance terahertz thermal devices and thz techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ correlations ]    along with the existence of the low - q transverse phononic gap we observe the emergence of the high - frequency transverse gap in two different thermodynamic points : ( t=438 k , p=0.8 gpa ; see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dis].b ) ) ) and ( t=400 k and t=500 k , p=0.8 gpa ; see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dis1].b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high - frequency phononic gap has recently been observed in the vicinity of the freezing point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of high - q transverse phononic gaps in the liquid and supercritical states is an unexpected and surprising result in view of structural simplicity of monatomic liquid ar . </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe the appearance of the high-@xmath2 gaps to the change in the atomic dynamics and pair correlations upon crossing the frenkel line . below the frenkel line </S>",
    "<S> the transverse phononic modes are heavily overdamped and , therefore , are not supported in the non - rigid fluid regime . as temperature increases in the non - rigid fluid regime ( </S>",
    "<S> see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dis1].a ) ) the longitudinal phononic modes attenuation takes place with strong phononic localization @xmath3 , which has been unanticipated . as a complementary test for our theoretical predictions , we calculate below correlation functions in the framework of the phenomenological green - kubo formalism at experimental thermodynamic conditions and beyond .    </S>",
    "<S> green and kubo demonstrated @xcite that _ phenomenological _ transport coefficients could be introduced as integrals over a time - correlation function in thermal equilibrium . the relaxation time and dissipation of fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> have the same origin toward the equilibrium when a system is out of equilibrium due to an external force . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , their scale are determined by the same transport coefficients . here </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the velocity - velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) at experimental conditions and beyond ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ corr].a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the velocity vector for a system of atoms is @xmath4 , then the vacf @xmath5 can be expressed as @xmath6 with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the diffusion constant . </S>",
    "<S> the rapid decrease of vacf implies the decrease in the pair correlations of atomic motion along the trajectories of the atoms . in a compressed liquid </S>",
    "<S> the vacf is not a simple exponential but has a negative part as its characteristic solid - like feature up to 11.5 ps . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 becomes shallow at longer times exhibiting a gas - like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> when the atomic motions become oscillatory , the vacf describes the oscillations because the velocity of the atoms self - correlates in a solid - like manner . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if the velocity of atoms has a definite direction , then the vacf gradually raises in its magnitude revealing the diffusive behavior of the atoms . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ corr].a ) we depict the evolution of vacf with temperature variations and evidence the dynamic crossover @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we calculate pair distribution function @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the internal energy , @xmath12 ) at the same thermodynamic conditions as for vacf . </S>",
    "<S> this function describes the distribution of distances between atomic pairs subjected to a given volume @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ corr].b ) , we show that liquid ar undergoes the structural crossover which corresponds to the qualitative change of atomic structure , the continuous transition of the substance from the _ rigid liquid _ structure ( pair correlations presented on an intermediate length scale ) to the _ non - rigid fluid _ structure ( pair correlations preserved on a short length scale only ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the origin of the structural crossover ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ corr].b ) , and relate it to the change of dynamics ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ corr].a ) of the liquid state . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 peaks decrease rapidly due to the exponential decrease of the relaxation time @xmath13 ( also see @xcite ) . in the _ non - rigid fluid _ regime where the oscillatory component of motion ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> corr].a ) and the medium - range pair correlations are no longer present ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ corr].b ) , pair correlations are less sensitive to temperature increase because the dynamics is already randomized as in a gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the system reached the frenkel line thermodynamic limit @xcite : @xmath14 ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eham ] ) ) giving @xmath15=2@xmath16 ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eham ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this picture supports the relationship between the dynamics ( phononic excitations ) , structure ( pair correlations ) and thermodynamics ( heat capacity ) , which is consistent with the temperature evolution on the p - t phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the frenkel line is a smooth and continuous thermodynamic boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this boundary begins in the neighborhood of the critical point and extends into the supercritical area up to very high p - t conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , however , at the frenkel line @xmath17 ; not exactly @xmath18 due to anharmonic effects ( @xmath19 ) @xcite , where @xmath20 is the thermal expansion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath18 is the new thermodynamic limit @xcite , in contrast to what used to be previously believed , but the thermodynamic boundary namely the frenkel line which is smeared out in its vicinity , where major thermodynamic quantities undergo their maxima or minima @xcite . </S>"
