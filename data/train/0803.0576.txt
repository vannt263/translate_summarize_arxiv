    "the following considers the secular gravitational perturbations that are exerted between a small eccentric satellite and a nearby planetary ring .",
    "this investigation is also a followup to the study described in @xcite , which examined the secular evolution of a small inclined satellite .",
    "there it was shown that the inclined satellite would launch a very long - wavelength spiral bending wave at the ring s nearby edge .",
    "since the excitation of the bending wave also communicates in - plane angular momentum from the satellite to the ring , that ring - satellite interaction resulted in a very vigorous damping of the satellite s inclination .",
    "a related problem was also considered by @xcite , who showed that an eccentric perturber orbiting in a gap in a pressure - supported gas disk will launch density waves at the gap s edge having such a long wavelength that a global standing wave emerges in the disk . the work described below considers a related but distinct problem , that of an eccentric satellite orbiting in a narrow gap in a self - gravitating planetary ring . here",
    "we show that the secular perturbations from the eccentric satellite also launches relatively long - wavelength density waves at the gap s outer edge .",
    "the principal goal of this study will be to derive the amplitude of these waves and their dispersion relation , which in turn will yield other useful properties , such as the wavenumber and the waves group velocity . since the mathematics of this density wave problem is very similar to",
    "that already developed for bending waves , the derivations presented here will be succinct .",
    "however , the reader interested in a more verbose description of a similar problem is referred to @xcite",
    ".    another goal of this effort will be to derive the rate at which the satellite s eccentricity @xmath1 is altered by the excitation of these density waves at the gap s edge .",
    "this is of interest because the satellite s @xmath1 also varies due to its many lindblad resonances in the ring , which tend to pump up the satellite s @xmath1 , while its many corotation resonances in the ring tend to damp the satellite s @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "although @xmath1-damping due to the corotation torque can dominate over @xmath1-excitation from the lindblad torque , the long - term stability of the satellite s eccentricity is still uncertain since the corotation torque is operative only when these particular resonances are not saturated .",
    "our purpose here is to determine whether the secular interaction described below is also a stabilizing process that leads to a net damping of the satellite s eccentricity .",
    "the following section begins with the lagrange planetary equations , which are used to derive the amplitude of these waves and their dispersion relation .",
    "section [ e - damping ] then uses those results to determine the rate at which the satellite s eccentricity evolves in response to the wave it launches at the gap edge .",
    "those analytic results are then confirmed in section [ sims ] via a numerical simulation of these waves , with conclusions reported in section [ summary ] .",
    "consider a planetary ring that is perturbed by a single satellite , with both orbiting an oblate planet .",
    "the lagrange planetary equations give the rates at which a ring particle s orbital eccentricity @xmath1 and longitude of periapse @xmath2 vary with time @xmath3 due to these perturbations @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the disturbing function for a small ring particle having a semimajor axis @xmath6 and mean motion @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gravitation constant and @xmath9 is the mass of the central planet , and all eccentricities are small , @xmath10 .",
    "the total disturbing function for a ring particle is @xmath11 , where the three terms account for the gravitational perturbations that are due to the ring s gravity ( which is treated here as a broad disk ) , the satellite s perturbations , and that due to the planet s oblate figure .",
    "the particle s equation of motion is thus the sum of three parts : @xmath12 noting that oblateness does not alter eccentricities . and",
    "because we are only dealing with the system s secular perturbations , the system s semimajor axes @xmath6 are all constant @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of a spiral density wave that is in a steady  state does not vary with time , so the disk eccentricities obey @xmath13 throughout the disk .",
    "a persistent spiral pattern must also rotate with a constant angular velocity @xmath14 , so    [ ss ] @xmath15    these equations are used to obtain the wave amplitude @xmath16 throughout the disk , and the waves dispersion relation @xmath17 as a function of the wavenumber @xmath18 .",
    "first calculate the rate at which the planetary ring perturbs itself .",
    "this ring is treated as a broad disk composed of many narrow , concentric annuli that have a mass @xmath19 , eccentricity @xmath16 , and longitude of periapse @xmath20 that are regarded as functions of the rings semimajor axes @xmath6 .",
    "each annulus also has a half - thickness @xmath21 that is due to the ring particles dispersion velocity .",
    "now suppose that the annulus at @xmath6 is perturbed by another annulus of mass @xmath22 and radius @xmath23 ; the perturbed annulus will then have a disturbing function @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 are the orbit elements of the perturbed annulus , the primed quantities refer to the perturbing annulus , and the @xmath26 and @xmath27 functions are    [ fg ] @xmath28    which depend on the semimajor axis ratio @xmath29 and the disk s dimensionless scale height @xmath30 , which is presumed small .",

    "<S> the lagrange planetary equations are used to study to secular evolution of a small , eccentric satellite that orbits within a narrow gap in a broad , self - gravitating planetary ring . </S>",
    "<S> these equations show that the satellite s secular perturbations of the ring will excite a very long - wavelength spiral density wave that propagates away from the gap s outer edge . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of these waves , as well as their dispersion relation , are derived here . that dispersion relation reveals that a planetary ring can sustain two types of density waves : long waves that , in saturn s a ring , would have wavelengths of @xmath0 km , and short waves that tend to be very nonlinear and are expected to quickly damp . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation of these waves also transports angular momentum from the ring to the satellite in a way that damps the satellite s eccentricity @xmath1 , which also tends to reduce the amplitude of subsequent waves . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of eccentricity damping due to this wave action is then compared to the rates at which the satellite s lindblad and corotation resonances alter the satellite s @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are then applied to the gap - embedded saturnian satellites pan and daphnis , and the long - term stability of their eccentricities is assessed . </S>"
