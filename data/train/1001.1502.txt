    "there continues to be active discussion of why and how solar coronal element abundances differ from those in the photosphere by amounts that depend on the first ionization potential ( fip ) .",
    "it is generally believed that elements with low fip ( @xmath3  ev ) have coronal abundances that are enhanced over the photospheric abundances @xcite by factors of between @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , while coronal abundances of high - fip elements are generally within a factor 2 of photospheric abundances .",
    "models explaining this  fip effect \" rely on some process that separates neutral atoms from ions at the chromospheric level , since there elements with low fip are at least partly ionized but elements with high fip are not .",
    "processes such as diffusion along vertical magnetic fields or magnetic fields raising ions into the corona but not neutral atoms @xcite have been considered .",
    "more recently , @xcite has proposed a model involving ponderomotive forces arising from the generation of alfvn waves from the chromosphere and into coronal loops .",
    "this model has the advantage of explaining the  inverse fip effect \" apparently present in active rs  cvn binary systems @xcite , i.e. low - fip elements having coronal abundances that are depleted compared with photospheric abundances .",
    "the model of @xcite involving electric currents within thin flux tubes involves fractionation at the level of the temperature minimum region , and might result in elements with extremely low fips to have coronal abundances enhanced by factors larger than 3 or 4 .",
    "@xcite has cited evidence that this is the case .",
    "potassium is of importance in this context as its fip is the lowest of any common solar element : 4.34  ev . there are , however , few potassium spectral lines strong enough to be observable by ultraviolet or x - ray spectrometers .",

    "* comparison of these values suggests that the potassium abundance is enhanced in coronal or flare plasmas over photospheric by a factor of between 1.8 and 3.3 .",
    "this would seem to argue against a fip mechanism such as those where the fractionation level is at the temperature minimum , resulting in much larger enhancement factors for elements such as k with very low fips .",
    "the resik x - ray spectrometer on the _ coronas - f _ solar spacecraft obtained numerous spectra in the range 3.46.1    in the period 2001 august to 2003 may .",

    "pulse - height analyzers enabled solar photons to be distinguished from those produced by fluorescence of the crystal material , enabling the instrumental background to be entirely eliminated for channels 1 and 2 ( si 111 crystal , @xmath13   ) and its amount accurately estimated for channels 3 and 4 ( quartz @xmath14 crystal , @xmath15   ) .",

    "absolute fluxes for the lines and continuum , estimated to have @xmath19  % accuracy , were derived using the procedure given by @xcite .",
    "a temperature distribution should strictly be used to describe the flare conditions for each spectrum , but we have generally found that an isothermal plasma generally characterizes resik spectra adequately in channels  1 and 2 .",
    "although there are a number of options for the determination of the single temperature for each spectrum , we elected to use temperatures from the ratio of emission in the two channels of _ goes _ , @xmath20 using conversion factors of @xcite ; the justification for this is given by @xcite .",

    "this value updates the determination of @xcite ( @xmath118 ) based on resik spectra during long - duration flares with a preliminary calibration and for periods when the pulse - height analyzers were not quite at optimum operation .",

    ", a chromospheric origin of the plasma is expected with abundances that reflect this origin .",
    "the models proposed by @xcite and @xcite for the fip effect were based on a fractionation level in the high chromosphere , so in the flare evaporation phase plasma with essentially photospheric origin ( i.e. below the fractionation level ) is delivered into the flare loops . however , there are some lines of evidence suggesting that the fractionation may occur in the lower chromosphere , below the level at which chromospheric evaporation occurs , so that coronal abundances are generally observed in flare plasmas . the present work on the abundance of k in flares appears to support the view that fractionation of elements occurs low in the chromosphere .",
    "the resik spectrometer has observed the he - like k ion x - ray lines in numerous flare spectra , and synthetic spectra based partly on the chianti atomic database and partly on new calculations presented here of dielectronic satellites compare well with the observed for temperatures and emission measures taken from the ratio of the two _ goes _ channels .",
