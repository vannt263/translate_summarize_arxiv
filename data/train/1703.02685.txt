    "consensus of multi - agent systems ( mass ) is a fundamental problem in collective behaviors of autonomous individuals , which has been extensively studied in the last decade @xcite .",
    "the key problem for consensus is to design appropriate distributed protocols that each agent can only get information from its local neighbors , and the whole network of agents may coordinate to reach an agreement on certain quantities of interest eventually .",
    "most of previous researches analyzed and solved the consensus problem based on the time - domain state - space model @xcite .",
    "other studies utilized the nyquist stability criterion in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "one contribution of this paper is to provide new insights of the consensus problem by exploring the recent development of graph signal processing in spatial frequency domain .",
    "graph signal processing has drawn great interests for analyzing high - dimensional data in recent years @xcite .",
    "there are two different frameworks on graph signal processing .",
    "one develops the discrete signal processing structure and concepts on graph based on the jordan normal form and generalized eigenbasis of the adjacency matrix@xcite . the other establishes the framework by merging algebraic and spectral graph concepts with classical signal processing which interprets the graph laplacian eigenvalues as graph frequencies and the orthonormal eigenvectors as graph fourier transformation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will first reveal the explicit connection between filtering of graph signals and consensus of mass .",
    "it is shown that the mas can reach its average consensus in finite time by designing an appropriate protocol filter to keep only the low frequency component of the graph ( corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the graph laplacian matrix ) while surrogating other higher frequency components .",
    "the designed graph filter can be implemented by a distributed consensus protocol derived from the closed - loop property of the mas and the laplacian matrix of the network graph .",
    "viewing mass from graph signal processing perspective not only provides new insights , it also presents a new methodology to solve some challenging problems in mass on uncertain networks . for mass with estimated laplacian matrix",
    ", we show that the graph signal processing perspective can help to design distributed consensus protocol gains as well as estimate the asymptotic consensus error , which is difficult to analyze by the existing time - domain state - space model based methods . for mass with completely unknown laplacian matrix except assuming the connectivity and the maximum degree of the network graph",
    ", we provide a new design method of the consensus protocol gain .",
    "the consensus error bound is also presented .",
    "numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods .",
    "let @xmath0 be an undirected graph of order @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) which consists of an agent set @xmath3 , an edge set @xmath4 , and a adjacency matrix @xmath5 \\in { \\re ^{n \\times n}}$ ] .",
