    "in recent years , approaches to molecular transport based on density - functional theory ( dft ) in combination with the non - equilibrium green s function formalism ( negf ) have received considerable attention in the literature , driven by the rapid progress in experimental work on realizing molecular nano - devices.@xcite a number of codes@xcite have been developed , including our own implementation within the adf / band quantum chemistry package.@xcite    as the methods have matured , scalability and the computational effort involved in studying progressively larger molecular systems have become important issues . in recent years , the focus of the field has shifted towards systems where the molecule predominantly determines the transport properties , rather than the metal - molecule interface .",
    "examples include systems where quantum interference plays a role.@xcite this necessitates accurate quantum chemical modeling of the molecule , while the details of the electrodes may be less important to transport .",
    "several approximations exist that trade sophistication for efficiency in the description of the electrodes,@xcite but to the best of our knowledge , there have been no systematic studies of the quality of the results obtained with such approximations .",
    "in this paper we consider methods that treat the molecule at the _ ab initio _ level of quantum chemical dft , but vary in the treatment of the electrodes .",
    "the most common approach is to use a wide - band limit ( wbl ) description , which based on the notion that the density of states ( dos ) in the electrodes is fairly constant near the fermi energy ( see below ) . in order to account for the effects of the metal - molecule interface , parts of the electrodes",
    "can be included in the dft calculation , resulting in a so - called `` extended molecule.''@xcite    in the more sophisticated approaches the effect of semi - infinite electrodes is included via self - energies in the self - consistent dft calculation of the extended molecule .",
    "however , this requires the use of a dft package capable of transport calculations .",
    "a common simplifying approach is therefore to perform the dft calculations on the extended molecule without the self - energies , and only add them afterwards in the calculation of the transport properties .",
    "this has the advantage that it can be implemented as a post - processing step which does not require modification of the underlying dft code ( _ e.g. _ , the artaios package@xcite ) .",
    "since the open - system character of an extended molecule with self - energies can lead to convergence problems , the closed - system character of this approximation may be advantageous .    in this paper",
    "we explore the limits of these approximations , both with and without a bias voltage applied over the molecular junction .",
    "we first briefly review the transport formalism which is based on non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) .",
    "we then introduce the hierarchy of approximations we consider , and compare their computational expense .",
    "we evaluate their quality by applying the methods to several junctions containing on phenyl - derivatives , both fully - conjugated and with broken conjugation .",
    "several studies exist in which , for a particular method , the effects of various modeling choices ( _ e.g. _ system size , basis - set , exchange - correlation potential or number of @xmath0-vectors ) on the accuracy have been investigated.@xcite the present study however , focuses mainly on comparing different methods on the same system .",
    "although the wbl approximation works well for systems with bulk metal electrodes , it is known to break down for lower - dimensional systems .",
    "we will show this explicitly in the case of a monatomic chain , but this can also be an issue in other electrodes such as carbon nanotubes@xcite ( 1d ) or graphene@xcite ( 2d ) .",
    "our results provide an understanding of the applicability and performance of the various approximations for different types of metal - molecule junctions .",
    "we note that the reliability of the transport calculation is limited by the accuracy of the underlying quantum chemistry method .",
    "in particular , dft is well founded for systems in their ground state or , more generally , in thermal equilibrium . in transport , however , we address substantial deviations from the stationary charge distribution , in which case the use of dft is less well established , in particular because of the shortcomings of the exchange - correlation potential which lacks the derivative discontinuity,@xcite as a result of the neglect of the self - interactions.@xcite a better alternative is the gw method , which incorporates dynamic response,@xcite but is prohibitively expensive in terms of computer resources for all but very small transport systems .",
    "in transport theory the device is partitioned into electrodes ( or leads ) and a transport region between them . in the landauer - bttiker formalism , the current through a junction is given by @xmath1t(\\epsilon),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fermi distributions on the left and right electrodes , respectively .",
    "the chemical potentials of the leads differ by the bias voltage : @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the transmission through the junction , which is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the couplings to the electrodes and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the retarded and advanced green s functions of the transport region , respectively .",
    "they are related by @xmath11 .",
    "the retarded green s function is @xmath12^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the transport region , and , in the case of a non - orthogonal basis , @xmath14 is the overlap matrix of the atomic basis functions . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the ( retarded ) self - energies due to the contacts .",
    "they can be split into a hermitian and anti - hermitian part according to@xcite @xmath17 for the calculations in this paper , we use a basis in which both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are real , symmetric matrices .",
    "@xmath18 , induces a shift of the orbital resonances ( _ i.e. _ , the poles of the green s function ) , while @xmath19 causes a broadening . for certain systems , such as a monatomic chain",
    "( see below ) in the tight - binding approximation , the self - energies can be calculated analytically.@xcite    it seems natural to identify the transport region with the molecule , in which case the self - energy is defined on the molecule , specifically near its interface with the metal . however , the self - energy then strongly depends on the contact geometry of the junction and the metal is not allowed to deform its electron density self - consistently near the interface in the presence of the molecule .",
    "it is therefore common to include part of the electrodes in the transport region , which then becomes a so - called `` extended molecule , '' and to the self - energy near a metal - metal interface deeper inside the contacts .",
    "this makes it possible to use a bulk calculation for the leads to obtain the self - energies , with the added benefit that they only have to be calculated once for a given electrode , irrespective of the molecule .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy can be shown to have the following form:@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 couples an electron with momentum state @xmath0 in the electrode to an atomic orbital @xmath22 on the molecule . near the fermi energy , @xmath21 are generally slowly - varying functions of the momentum @xmath0.@xcite moreover , for metals such as gold , the dos is approximately constant near the fermi energy@xcite ( see below ) . to a first approximation , we can therefore take @xmath23 to be independent of @xmath24 .",
    "if we then also neglect the level - shift @xmath18 , we obtain the wide - band limit ( wbl ) approximation .",
    "this yields a self - energy of the form @xmath25 where @xmath14 is again the overlap matrix in the case of a non - orthogonal basis . in the wbl",
    ", we have effectively replaced the complexity of the full self - energy by a single parameter @xmath26 .",
    "although @xmath27 in general , in this paper we take them to be the same for simplicity .",
    "computationally , the main advantage of the wbl is that the eigenspace of the green s function ( eq .  [ eq : green ] ) becomes independent of the energy @xmath24 .",
    "we can therefore diagonalize the green s function before evaluating the transport properties , dramatically reducing the computational cost .",
    "and @xmath28 of bulk au without pbcs , defined as the average of the diagonal elements of @xmath29 . ]",
    "we evaluate four different approaches for transport calculations ( within the negf+dft framework ) by comparing their results for a typical metal - molecule - metal junction . in decreasing order of sophistication and computational expense ,",
    "these are :    1 .   * full - scf * : a fully self - consistent transport calculation , where the full self - energies of the metal electrodes are taken into account during the calculation .",
    "this corresponds to the steady state of an open system .",
    "this approach allows us to include a bias voltage by varying the chemical potential of the electrodes .",
    "* post - scf * : a calculation of a closed system , consisting of only the extended molecule , which includes a finite part of the electrodes .",
    "the self - energy of the semi - infinite electrodes is then added _",
    "after _ reaching convergence , in order to enable the calculation of transport properties .",
    "* wbl - metal * : similar to post - scf , but instead of using the full self - energies in the calculation of the transport properties , the wide - band limit is employed at a metal - metal interface in the electrode .",
    "* wbl - molecule * : similar to wbl - metal , but here the wide - band self - energies are coupled directly to the molecule , and no metal atoms are actually present in the calculation .",
    "the corresponding implications for the geometry in the models are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : methods ] .",
    "the full - scf method is the reference method to which the other approaches are compared .",
    "the difference with post - scf gives us an idea of the importance of self - consistency in the calculation . a comparison with wbl - metal shows the applicability of the wide - band limit for metal electrodes , while a comparison with wbl - molecule tells us something about the effect of the electrode surface on the molecule .    in the full - scf method",
    "the bias voltage is applied by varying the chemical potential in the electrodes and simultaneously introducing an electric field inside the junction . because the calculation is done self - consistently , this yields the correct potential profile in the junction .",
    "this can not be achieved by the other methods , but the effect of the bias voltage can be approximated by introducing an electric field over the molecule . in practice",
    "this only works for the isolated molecule , since applying it over an extended molecule leads to convergence difficulties .",
    "finite - bias calculations are therefore only feasible with the full - scf and wbl - molecule methods .    in molecular junctions",
    "the magnitude of the field is typically of the order of @xmath30  v / nm . since this is much smaller than the internal field of the molecule , the perturbation of the hamiltonian is effectively linear in the bias voltage . in practice ,",
    "the hamiltonian therefore only has to be calculated twice : at zero and at maximum bias . for other voltages the hamiltonian",
    "can then be obtained by linear interpolation . since the cost of the transport calculation is negligible in the case of wbl - molecule ( see table  [ tab : expense ] ) , this makes efficient evaluation of the full current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics feasible .",
    "table  [ tab : expense ] summarizes the computational expense of the four methods for a typical molecular junction ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : bdt ] and discussed in the next section ) .",
    "timings for the electrode calculations include both dft and the evaluation of the self - energies .",
    "these are not required for the wbl methods , and for the full - scf and post - scf calculations they only need to be performed once , and so are never a bottleneck .",
    "the difference in run time between full - scf and post - scf is due to the underlying dft code ( see appendix  [ se : details ] for details ) .",
    "there are large differences between the timings of the ( extended ) molecule calculations .",
    "the difference between full - scf and post - scf is caused by the fact that calculating the electron density of an open system requires integrating the green s function at every cycle in the dft calculation.@xcite the remainder of the difference is again due to the underlying dft code .",
    "the post - scf and wbl - metal methods use the same calculation of the extended molecule and therefore have the same timings , while the difference with the wbl - molecule method is due to the absence of the electrodes .",
    "the evaluation of the transport properties is similar for full - scf and post - scf , resulting in comparable timings . in the wbl methods , on the other hand",
    ", the green s function can be diagonalized independent of energy ( see section  [ se : theory ] ) , leading to a speedup of more than two orders of magnitude .    before applying the methods to a molecular junction ,",
    "we first consider just gold , the metal generally used for electrodes .",
    "recall that the wide - band limit ( section  [ se : theory ] ) relies on the dos being nearly independent of energy near the fermi energy .",
    "this is verified in fig .  [",
    "fg : au.dos ] , where we have plotted the dos and the ( average of the trace of the ) self - energy of gold as a function of energy . in the case of bulk gold , _",
    "i.e. _ , with periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) , the dos is indeed constant within @xmath31  ev of the fermi energy . for a gold wire ( with a cross - section of @xmath32 atoms ,",
    "see appendix  [ se : details ] ) , oscillations reminiscent of van hove singularities become visible , due to the essentially one - dimensional nature of the system .",
    "however , apart from a single pole at @xmath33  ev , the self - energy is still approximately constant .",
    "this suggests that even for a gold wire , the wbl will be a good approximation , at least at the metal - metal interface .",
    "we will now compare the quality of the different methods by applying them to typical molecular junctions with gold ( au ) electrodes , and investigate the effect of the bias voltage on the transmission . for molecular junctions with bulk electrodes",
    "both wbl methods give good agreement with the more sophisticated methods .",
    "however , in the case of lower - dimensional systems they break down , as we will demonstrate explicitly for a monatomic aluminum ( al ) chain .",
    ".comparison of computational expense of the four approaches applied to a typical molecular junction .",
    "all calculations have been performed on an 8 core 3 ghz intel xeon workstation .",
    "@xmath34the calculations of the transport properties with the wbl methods have been performed on a single core . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     , the left panels show transmissions for the conjugated molecule calculated with the full - scf ( top ) and wbl - molecule ( bottom , @xmath35  ev ) approaches , while the right panels show the same for the broken - conjugation variant .",
    "the full - scf calculation uses the junction geometry from fig .",
    "[ fg : ope-2a ] . ]    in the main text , we have presented results for molecular junctions with thiol - gold couplings . to illustrate that our results are not exclusively applicable to this particular case",
    ", we discuss the ope molecule with amine - linkers and compare the results with those obtained for the thiol - terminated molecule .",
    "we show results for both cases , using all methods .",
    "[ fg : ope-2 ] shows the zero - bias transmission of ope-2 ( with thiol linkers ) , calculated with the four different methods . as in the case of bdt ( fig .",
    "[ fg : bdt ] ) , the post - scf and wbl - metal transmissions are in good agreement with the full - scf result .",
    "the splitting between the homo peaks is again slightly overestimated .",
    "for wbl - molecule , the homo ",
    "lumo gap is closer to the full - scf gap than in the case of bdt .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the difference in confinement between the isolated and extended molecule is smaller for ope-2 than for bdt .",
    "exchanging thiol linkers for amines ( fig .",
    "[ fg : ope-2a ] ) leads to a larger homo  lumo gap and a single sharp peak in the transmission for the homo .",
    "this is explained by the weaker coupling of the amine , which binds to a single gold adatom.@xcite interestingly , both the post - scf and wbl - metal , but not the wbl - molecule , transmissions show a `` shoulder '' to the right of the homo peak .",
    "this peak corresponds to a bonding / anti - bonding pair of orbitals on the gold , although the coupling through the molecule is stronger than in the case of fig .",
    "[ fg : bdt.wbl]a .",
    "it does , however , decrease for larger values of @xmath36 .    for the conjugated version of ope-2 ( amine ) , the bias - dependence of both the full - scf and wbl - molecule transmission ( fig .",
    "[ fg : ope-2a.bias ] ) is similar to that of ope-2 ( thiol ) . for the broken - conjugation",
    ", the wbl - molecule transmission follows the same trend as in fig .",
    "[ fg : ope-2.bias ] , although the peak is split even at zero - bias .",
    "the rapid oscillations in the full - scf transmission below the homo peak make it difficult to determine whether such splitting is present .",
    "the homo peak itself does follow the same trend as for wbl - molecule ( and fig .",
    "[ fg : ope-2.bias ] ) ; the peak decreases in magnitude and shifts up in energy for higher bias .",
