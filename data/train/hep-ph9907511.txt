    "the production of final state photons at large transverse momenta in high - energy processes is an important observable for testing qcd .",
    "data on large-@xmath3 photon production in hadronic collisions have been used in the past to obtain information on the gluon distribution in the photon .",
    "in addition , a good understanding of direct photon production within the framework of the standard model will be essential for new physics searches at future colliders .",
    "photons from high - energy collisions are produced essentially by two mechanisms : the direct production of a photon off a primary quark or antiquark , or the fragmentation of a hadronic jet into a single photon carrying a large fraction of the jet energy .",
    "the direct production gives rise to perturbatively calculable short - distance contributions whereas the fragmentation contribution is due primarily to a long distance process which can not be calculated completely inside perturbative qcd .",
    "the latter is described by the process - independent quark- , antiquark- , or gluon - to - photon fragmentation functions ( ff ) @xcite which must be fixed by experimental data as long as they can not be calculated by non - perturbative methods . their evolution with the factorization scale @xmath4 and their so - called point - like contribution ( up to a normalization )",
    "can , however , be calculated perturbatively .",
    "directly produced photons are usually well separated from hadron jets , while photons originating from the fragmentation process are primarily found inside hadronic jets . by imposing an isolation criterion on the photon",
    ", one can , in principle , suppress ( but in general , not eliminate ) the fragmentation contribution to the final state photon cross section .",
    "so far , only a limited number of measurements of single photon production exists through which direct information on the photon ff can be obtained .",
    "a possible way is the measurement of the inclusive photon cross section in @xmath5 annihilation .",
    "recently the opal collaboration at lep has measured this cross section for final state photons in the range @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the photon energy fraction in terms of the beam energy @xcite .",
    "the results are in reasonable agreement with predictions obtained within perturbative qcd using the model - dependent parametrizations of the photon ff of do @xcite , grv @xcite or bfg @xcite , when choosing the factorization scale @xmath8 .",
    "the do model for the ff is based on an asymptotic solution of the evolution equation whereas the other two models @xcite contain in addition a non - perturbative input inspired by the vector meson dominance model .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental precision was not sufficiently high to discriminate between these theoretical predictions .",
    "note also that in @xcite it was shown that predictions obtained within perturbative qcd and using a fixed - order expanded expression for the photon ff also agreed well with the opal data .",
    "an alternative way to determine the ff from @xmath5 data is to measure the production of photons accompanied with a definite number of hadronic jets @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the photon is treated like any other hadron and is clustered simultaneously with the other hadrons into jets ( so - called democratic clustering procedure ) @xcite .",
    "then , one of the jets in the final state is considered as the photon jet if the fraction of the electromagnetic energy inside the jet is sufficiently large , i.e.   @xmath9 with @xmath10 fixed by the experimental conditions . on this basis the aleph collaboration at lep analysed events produced at the @xmath11-resonance @xcite which contained one hadron jet and a jet with a photon carrying at least @xmath12 of the jet energy .",
    "this @xmath13-jet rate was used to determine the quark - to - photon ff , which was calculated in leading order ( lo ) , i.e.  up to o(@xmath14 ) , in @xcite .",
    "the calculation was extended to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , i.e.  up to o(@xmath15 ) , in @xcite and a nlo photon - to - quark ff was obtained @xcite by comparing with the aleph data . due to the unfavorable signal - to - background ratio below @xmath16 for this particular observable , the @xmath13-jet rate , the photon ff could be determined only in the range @xmath17 . in @xcite also",
    "the predictions of grv @xcite and bfg @xcite for the photon ff were compared to the aleph @xmath13-jet data .",
    "it turned out that the bfg parametrization is in agreement with the measurements while the rate predicted with the help of the ff of grv lies too high .",
    "the photon ff is process independent as any other ff and can be used to predict the cross section for the production of single photons in other processes .",
    "this has been done recently for isolated photon production in deep - inelastic @xmath18 scattering ( dis ) @xcite . in that",
    "work the emphasis was put on the prediction of cross sections in the hera kinematic range without the necessity to introduce photon - parton separation cuts as used in earlier work @xcite .",
    "this was achieved by including the divergent photon - quark ( -antiquark ) singular contributions and the bare quark - to - photon fragmentation contributions , leaving in the final result only a finite factorization scale dependent quark - to - photon ff contribution . in our previous work we adopted as the photon",
    "ff the lowest - order fit obtained from the photon+1-jet data of the aleph collaboration @xcite .    in the present work we study the influence of the fragmentation contribution on the cross section for the production of a photon plus jets in dis and give predictions for @xmath19 as a function of @xmath1 in the interval @xmath20 ( for the definition of @xmath1 see below ) . for this purpose",
    "we calculate @xmath19 with the same cuts on the dis variables as in @xcite for essentially three different sets of photon ff s , the aleph sets in lo and nlo @xcite , the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) and beyond - leading logarithmic ( bll ) parametrizations of grv @xcite and the bll parametrization of bfg @xcite .",
    "the first set of photon ff is obtained within a fixed - order framework at a given order in @xmath21 .",
    "the two other sets were obtained after the leading and/or next - to - leading logarithms of the factorization scale @xmath22 were resummed .",
    "the essence of these two approaches has been described extensively in @xcite and will be outlined below .",
    "in leading order from the @xmath23 vertex . ]",
    "( i.e. , at o(@xmath14 ) ) , the cross section for the production of photon plus jets in dis receives contributions from the quark ( antiquark ) subprocess @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "together with the remnant jet from the proton this process gives rise to a @xmath26-jet final state . in the virtual photon - proton center - of - mass system",
    "the hard @xmath27 recoils against the hard jet back - to - back .",
    "cuts on the usual dis variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath0 are applied to remove @xmath27 production by incoming @xmath30 s of small virtuality . to produce @xmath27 s of sufficiently high energy , an explicit cut on the total @xmath31 center - of - mass energy , @xmath32 ,",
    "is introduced .",
    "both leptons and quarks emit photons .",
    "the leptonic radiation is suppressed by a cut on the photon emission angle with respect to the incoming electron in the same way as in the earlier work @xcite . in lo",
    "each parton is identified with a jet and the photon is automatically isolated from the quark jet by demanding a non - zero transverse momentum of the photon or jet in the @xmath31 center - of - mass frame . at this order",
    "there is no fragmentation contribution .    at next - to - leading order ( o(@xmath15 ) ) we have subprocesses with an additional gluon , either in the final or in the initial state , i.e.   the subprocesses @xmath33  ( and similarly with @xmath34 replaced by @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 , respectively . in addition , virtual corrections ( one - loop diagrams at o(@xmath15 ) ) to the lo processes have to be included .",
    "the processes @xmath33  and @xmath36  contribute both to the @xmath26-jets cross section and to the cross section for @xmath37-jets . in the latter case each parton in the final state",
    "( including the photon ) builds a jet on its own , whereas for @xmath26-jets a pair of final state partons is combined into one jet .",
    "the recombination of two partons will be performed with the help of the cone algorithm .",
    "the exact prescriptions will be given later when we present our results .",
    "in the nlo calculation of the @xmath26-jet cross section one encounters the well known infrared and collinear singularities .",
    "for the processes @xmath33  and @xmath36  they appear in those phase space regions where two partons are degenerate to one parton , i.e.  when one of the partons becomes soft or two partons become collinear to each other .",
    "these singularities cancel in the case of soft gluons or for collinear quark - gluon pairs against the singularities from the virtual corrections to the lo process or have to be factorized and absorbed into the renormalized parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) of the proton . to accomplish this cancellation ,",
    "the singularities are isolated in an analytic calculation with the help of dimensional regularization and the phase space slicing method .",
    "the technical details of this procedure have been described in @xcite and need not to be repeated here .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath38 for the processes @xmath33  and @xmath36   have also photonic infrared and collinear singularities .",
    "the infrared singularity is outside the kinematical region we are interested in since the photon is required to be observed in the detector . in the numerical calculation of the cross section",
    "we impose this condition by demanding a minimal transverse momentum of the final state photon .",
    "this cut removes also collinear singularities due to initial state photon radiation .",
    "final state collinear singularities are present and are treated with the phase space slicing method similar to the case of the quark - gluon collinear contribution . for this purpose the phase space slicing parameter @xmath39 is introduced , which is chosen very small , so that the matrix element @xmath38 can be approximated by its singular part .",
    "the slicing of the phase space is done with the help of the scaled squared invariant masses , for example , with @xmath40 for the subprocess @xmath33 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the four - momenta of the outgoing photon and quark , respectively . in",
    "the gluon initiated subprocess one has two singular regions , which are controlled by the variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . in the region @xmath45",
    "the cross section is evaluated numerically .",
    "the details for the calculation of the various contributions are described in @xcite .",
    "the contribution to @xmath38 in the region @xmath46 is collinearly divergent and is regulated by dimensional regularization .",
    "the divergent part is absorbed into the bare photon ff to yield the renormalized photon ff denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "the additional fragmentation contribution to @xmath38 for the subprocess @xmath33  has the following form @xmath48 there is a similar expression for the subprocess @xmath36 .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ m2frag ] ) that the fragmentation contribution is o(@xmath49 ) , the photon ff @xmath50 given by @xmath51 being of o(@xmath14 ) .",
    "@xmath52 in ( [ dqg ] ) stands for the non - perturbative ff of the transition @xmath53 at the factorization scale @xmath22 , i.e.  the scale at which the redefinition has been performed .",
    "this function will be given by one of the sets of photon ff mentioned above . the second term in ( [ dqg ] ) ,",
    "if substituted in ( [ m2frag ] ) , is the finite part resulting from adding the bare photon ff and the collinear photon - quark ( -antiquark ) contribution to the matrix element @xmath54 integrated in the region @xmath46 .    the @xmath39 dependence in ( [ dqg ] ) is expected to cancel the dependence of the numerically evaluated @xmath26-jet cross section restricted to the region @xmath55 as studied in @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath39 is only a technical cut separating divergent from finite contributions .",
    "this collinear photon - quark ( -antiquark ) contribution to the matrix element @xmath56 being calculated in the collinear approximation is valid only up to terms o(@xmath39 ) .",
    "consequently the cut @xmath39 must be chosen sufficiently small .",

    ", @xmath57 is the lo quark - to - photon splitting function @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the electric charge of quark @xmath34 .",
    "the variable @xmath60 denotes the fraction of the final photon energy in terms of the energy of the quark emitting the photon .",
    "if the photon is emitted from a final state quark with four - momentum @xmath61 , then @xmath60 is obtained from @xmath62 .",
    "it can also be related to the invariants @xmath63 and @xmath64 obtained from the four - momenta of the subprocess @xmath65 with the result @xmath66 according to ( [ m2frag ] ) the fragmentation contribution to the subprocess @xmath67 is calculated from the convolution of the ff with the o(@xmath68 ) matrix element @xmath38 of the process @xmath69 , which is well known .",
    "it yields a term of o(@xmath49 ) to the cross section for @xmath26-jets .",
    "similarly the fragmentation contribution to the subprocess @xmath36  is calculated from the convolution of the ff for @xmath70 with the matrix element @xmath38 of the process @xmath71 which is also known .",
    "equivalent formulas are used for the calculation of the fragmentation contribution to @xmath72 and @xmath36 , where the @xmath35 fragments into a photon .",
    "the fragmentation is always assumed to occur collinearly , i.e.  with no additional transverse momentum in the fragmentation process .",
    "as long as we intend to calculate the @xmath73-jet cross section only up to o(@xmath49 ) we need the photon ff only in lo , i.e.  at o(@xmath14 ) .",

    "a fit with a larger value of @xmath68 is also reported in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the lo and nlo ff s of the photon as given in ( [ dqg - solu ] ) together with ( [ dqg - lo ] ) and in ( [ dqg - solu2 ] ) together with ( [ dqg - nlo ] ) do not take into account resummation of powers of @xmath94 as usually implemented , e.g.  via altarelli - parisi evolution @xcite .",
    "such resummations are only unambiguous if the resummed logarithm is the only large logarithm in the kinematical region under consideration .",
    "if logarithms of different arguments can become simultaneously large , the resummation of one of these logarithms at a given order implies that all other potentially large logarithms are shifted into a higher order of the perturbative expansion , i.e.  are neglected . in the evaluation of the @xmath89-jet rate at @xmath95 @xcite and @xmath96 @xcite at lep for @xmath97 ,",
    "one encounters at least two different potentially large logarithms , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the high @xmath60 region , the region",
    "where the photon is isolated or almost isolated it is by far not clear that @xmath98 is the largest logarithm .",
    "choosing not to resum the logarithms of @xmath100 is therefore equally justified for the case of large @xmath101 .    in the conventional approach ,",
    "the parton - to - photon ff s @xmath102 satisfy a system of inhomogeneous evolution equations @xcite .",
    "usually these equations are diagonalized in terms of the singlet and non - singlet quark ff s as well as the gluon ff . for the case",
    "that the gluon - to - photon fragmentation is neglected , which we shall do in our application to dis @xmath27+jets production , these equations can be simplified @xcite .",
    "then the flavor singlet and non - singlet quark - to - photon ff s become equal to a unique function @xmath103 .",
    "this function satisfies the all - orders evolution equation @xmath104 which has a similar form as the next - to - leading order evolution in the fixed - order approach , but the coupling @xmath68 is not fixed and now is taken as a function of the factorization scale @xmath4 .",
    "the full solution @xmath105 of the all - orders inhomogeneous evolution equation is a sum of two contributions .",
    "the first term is the point - like ( or perturbative ) part @xmath106 , which in the leading logarithmic ( ll ) approximation is a solution of the inhomogeneous equation ( [ dqg - evol - in ] ) .",
    "the second term is the hadronic ( or non - perturbative ) part @xmath107 , which is the solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation .",
    "this term must be fitted to experimental data to obtain the input at a starting scale . at ll only terms of the form @xmath108 are kept while beyond leading logarithms ( bll ) both the leading and the sub - leading ( @xmath109 ) logarithms of @xmath4 are resummed to all orders in the strong coupling constant @xmath68 .",
    "thus the lo solution ( [ dqg - solu ] ) is the @xmath110 term of the ll approximation , whereas the nlo solution ( [ dqg - solu2 ] ) is the bll approximation up to the order @xmath111 . by dropping the @xmath112 terms in ( [ dqg - solu2 ] )",
    "one can also infer the ll approximation up to the order @xmath111 .    in this conventional approach , the quark - to - photon fragmentation function",
    "is regarded as being of @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath110 term of the ll approximation is proportional to @xmath114 . at large scales @xmath115 and assuming that @xmath4 can be identified with the scale that determines @xmath68 , i.e.  @xmath116 , the ll ff becomes of the order of o(@xmath117 ) .",
    "this motivates the usual statement that the total fragmentation contribution is like o(@xmath14 ) , i.e.  of the same order as the lo direct photon contribution .",
    "of course , this statement depends on the considered kinematic region . with this argument",
    "however , one usually justifies the inclusion of terms in the fragmentation contribution of o(@xmath118 ) which become of o(@xmath49 ) if the ff is considered of o(@xmath117 ) .",
    "the most recent parametrizations of photon ff s in the conventional approach as described in the previous paragraph are those of grv @xcite and bfg @xcite .",
    "the ff s of grv @xcite exist in the ll as well as in the bll form , which in the following we shall denote as the lo and nlo ff s of grv .",
    "however , the ff of bfg @xcite are available only in the bll approximation .",
    "they both have been compared to the aleph @xmath119-jet cross section @xcite , which is sensitive to the large @xmath60 region ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the bfg prediction goes through the experimental points whereas the grv nlo parametrization lies systematically higher and agrees less well with the aleph data @xcite .",
    "this difference can be attributed to both the choice of the input scale @xmath77 and of the non - perturbative input at this scale .",
    "the bfg input is smaller and according to the aleph data this choice is preferred .",
    "thus we have at least five different versions of photon ff s at our disposal which have been compared to the aleph data : two lo parametrizations , the one using the aleph data directly to determine the initial distribution given in ( [ dqg - solu ] ) and ( [ dqg - lo ] ) and the grv parametrization in lo ; and three nlo choices , the one written in ( [ dqg - solu2 ] ) and ( [ dqg - nlo ] ) directly fitted to the aleph data , and the nlo parametrizations of grv and bfg .",
    "we shall use these five parametrizations to predict the @xmath73-jet cross section in deep - inelastic @xmath18 scattering .",
    "the results for these cross sections are obtained for energies and kinematical cuts appropriate for the hera experiments .",
    "the energies of the incoming electron and proton are @xmath121 gev and @xmath122 gev , respectively .",

    "the cut on @xmath126 , the angle between the photon and the outgoing electron momentum , suppresses radiation from the final - state electron .",
    "the @xmath127 and the hadron jet @xmath128 are required to have minimal transverse momenta @xmath129 different values of minimal @xmath3 s for the photon and the jet have to be chosen in order to avoid the otherwise present infrared sensitivity of the nlo predictions @xcite .",

    "the photon is treated like any other parton during recombination , so that one of the recombined jets may be the photon jet .",
    "for the recombination of the two partons into a hadron jet or a parton and the photon into the photon jet , we use the cone algorithm of the snowmass convention @xcite .",

    "if for example , parton @xmath136 is the @xmath127 , then @xmath128 is the photon jet .",
    "the jet variables @xmath141 and @xmath142 are obtained from the averages of the corresponding variables of the recombined partons @xmath136 and @xmath137 multiplied with their respective @xmath3 values and @xmath143 .",
    "we choose @xmath144 .",
    "the azimuthal angle is defined with respect to the scattering plane defined by the momenta of the ingoing and outgoing electron .",
    "it is known that the cone algorithm is ambiguous for final states with more than three particles or partons .",
    "since we have maximally three partons in the final state this is not relevant in our case .",
    "furthermore it will be no problem to repeat the calculation for any other cluster algorithm that might be used in the analysis of forthcoming experimental data .",
    "it is obvious that for the fragmentation contribution the cone constraint is always satisfied since the hadronic remnant in the fragmentation is collinear with the photon .",

    "[ fig2 ] the cross section @xmath19 in the region @xmath160 is plotted for the photon ff s from ( [ dqg - solu ] ) and ( [ dqg - lo ] ) ( denoted aleph ) and from ( [ dqg - solu2 ] ) and ( [ dqg - nlo ] ) ( denoted ggdr(@xmath90 ) in the figure ) .",
    "for both cases the cross section first decreases with increasing @xmath1 until it reaches a minimum near @xmath161 , from which it increases strongly towards @xmath158 .",
    "this dependence is similar to what has been found for the photon plus one - jet cross section in @xmath5 annihilation at the @xmath11-resonance @xcite .",
    "note however , that below @xmath162 , i.e.  outside the range shown in these figures , the cross section decreases again towards smaller values of @xmath1 . unlike at lep ,",
    "the photon - jet is here required to have a minimal transverse momentum as given by ( [ zgamma - pt ] ) .",
    "the decrease in the cross section for values of @xmath1 below 0.5 is a kinematical effect resulting from the imposition of this cut .",
    "for the two choices of ff s the predicted cross section differs by approximately @xmath163 .",
    "the cross section for the lo ff is smaller than for the nlo ff .",
    "we note that the @xmath68 value quoted for this ff is not the value for which the cross section was calculated ; rather it is the value which was chosen to fit the photon ff to the aleph data .",
    "both photon ff s fit the aleph data in lo and nlo approximation . in our case",
    "only the lo ff is appropriate .",
    "the result for the nlo ff gives just an indication of higher - order corrections up to o(@xmath118 ) .",
    "however , it is not a full prediction at this order since the nnlo calculation for the direct contribution has not been done , the nlo corrections to @xmath38 on the right - hand - side of ( [ m2frag ] ) are not included either .",
    "( 160,100 ) ( 30,-1 )    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the predictions with grv @xcite and bfg @xcite ff s are shown .",
    "both are ff s in nlo and with all leading and subleading logarithms of @xmath164 resummed at the next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy .",
    "the behavior of the cross section as a function of @xmath1 is qualitatively similar to the result in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the cross section for grv is larger than the one with the bfg ff .",
    "this is to be expected since grv gives a larger @xmath5 cross section for @xmath165-jet than bfg also for the aleph kinematical conditions .    comparing with the fixed - order result in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the bfg cross section lies above the fixed - order prediction obtained using the lo ff over the whole @xmath1 region .",
    "the discrepancy is largest in the region @xmath166 where the cross section is smaller . at the minimum",
    "the two cross sections differ by more than a factor two .",
    "( 160,100 ) ( 30,-1 )    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the results for the grv photon ff s are displayed , but now for both the lo and the nlo parametrization .",
    "on the average the cross section for the lo fragmentation function is again smaller by @xmath167 compared to the nlo prediction .",
    "in addition , we have plotted the cross sections for the point - like approximations of the ff s .",
    "this approximation is rather good , i.e.  the influence of the hadronic part of the ff is small in the considered @xmath1 range .",
    "we note that the difference between the full ff and the point - like part increases with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "if we compare our results for the various photon ff s in figs.[fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we observe that the predictions agree approximately within @xmath167 in the small and large @xmath1 regions , i.e.  for @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "however , near the minimum of the cross section , i.e.  in the region @xmath166 , the results differ by up to a factor two .",
    "the largest differences occur between the predictions obtained with the aleph photon fragmentation function on the one side and the grv and bfg parametrizations on the other side .",
    "this difference comes mainly from the fact that different evolution approaches are used .",
    "whereas for grv and bfg the ff at @xmath170 is obtained from the conventional evolution after the leading and/or subleading logarithms of @xmath22 were resummed , the aleph ff s are evolved only to the respective finite order in @xmath21 as given in ( [ dqg - solu ] ) and ( [ dqg - solu2 ] ) . therefore , if we calculated @xmath19 for @xmath171-jets at the large scale @xmath8 the cross sections obtained for bfg and aleph would come out quite similar over the whole @xmath1 range inside the @xmath167 margin .",
    "only when we go to the scale @xmath170 , which on the average is much smaller , we observe that the cross section obtained using the bfg photon fragmentation function is much larger than the aleph cross section in the region @xmath172 .    provided the resummed solution of the all - orders evolution equation",
    "can be accurately determined @xcite over the whole @xmath1 range under consideration , i.e.  for @xmath173 , the approach using this solution represents the theoretically preferred approach as it is the most complete .",
    "the approach using an expanded and therefore approximated photon ff has however important advantages .",
    "as already mentioned , its use leads to factorization scale independent results for the cross section evaluated at a given fixed order in @xmath21 .",
    "moreover it enables an analytic determination of the photon ff .    within the conventional approaches ,",
    "the bfg prediction should be preferred over the result with the grv ff .",
    "the difference between grv and bfg in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is related to the choice of a different input at the starting scale @xmath77 .",
    "as already mentioned , the bfg parametrization is in better agreement with the aleph data @xcite than the grv nlo parametrization and therefore is the more realistic choice of ff for the photon .",
    "this could be further tested as soon as data from hera on photon plus jet production in dis become available .",
    "we have presented a nlo calculation for the production of photons accompanied by jets in deep inelastic electron proton scattering , taking into account the contribution from quark - to - photon fragmentation .",
    "we have calculated the cross section as a function of @xmath1 for those parametrizations of the photon fragmentation functions , which had been compared to photon plus jet data from the aleph collaboration . as we observed significant differences between the predictions",
