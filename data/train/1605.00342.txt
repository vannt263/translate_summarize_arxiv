    "we construct their syz mirrors and deduce their modular properties from the khler geometries . along the way",
    ", we develop the foundations for the toric calabi  yau manifolds of infinite - type and their equivariant syz mirror symmetry .",
    "we begin with the local calabi ",

    "we construct the syz mirrors of the local calabi ",
    "yau surfaces @xmath8 and express them by modular objects .",
    "for instance , the most fundamental surface @xmath12 has the syz mirror given in terms of the jacobi theta function @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are sections of certain line bundles . in other words ,",

    "the generating function is a crucial object giving the quantum corrections in syz mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "the following is an open analog of the yau ",
    "zaslow formula .",
    "[ thm : root - yz - intro ] @xmath25    the above surface geometry has a natural extension to the higher dimensions .",
    "namely , for @xmath26 , we consider a crepant resolution @xmath27 of the multiple fiber product @xmath28 .",
    "we call such a manifold a _ local calabi  yau manifold of type @xmath0 _ , which serves as a local model of a higher dimensional analog of schoen s calabi  yau 3-fold",
    ". we will prove that the syz mirror of a local calabi ",
    "yau manifold of type @xmath0 has a beautiful expression in terms of the riemann theta functions with characters . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider the local calabi ",
    "yau 3-fold @xmath29 .",
    "[ thm : mirintro ] the syz mirror of the local calabi  yau 3-fold @xmath29 is given by , for @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the genus @xmath1 riemann theta function , @xmath33 lies in the siegel upper half - plane , and @xmath34    as before @xmath18 and @xmath19 are sections of suitable line bundles .",
    "thus equation defines a conic fibration over the abelian surface @xmath35 with discriminant being the genus @xmath1 curve , called the _ mirror curve _ , given by the zero locus of the genus @xmath1 riemann theta function @xmath32 .",
    "the function @xmath36 is the generating function of the open gromov ",
    "witten invariants of a lagrangian torus fiber of a syz fibration of @xmath29 .",
    "it is a 3-dimensional analog of the generating function @xmath21 , and equation is a 3-dimensional analog of the defining equation in theorem [ thm : root - yz - intro ] .",
    "the higher dimensional generalizations of @xmath36 are also considered in theorem [ thm : mir_x_1 ] .",
    "they have interesting modular properties ( proposition [ prop : modular ] ) , and we anticipate that they are closely related with the higher genus siegel modular forms , generalizing the dedekind eta function .",
    "mirror symmetry provided in theorem [ thm : mirintro ] can be understood geometrically as follows . the local calabi ",
    "3-fold @xmath29 can be regarded as a partial compactification of ( an analytic open subset of ) the resolved conifold @xmath37 , whose mirror curve is a @xmath38-punctured @xmath39 by the work of hori  iqbal ",
    "vafa @xcite ( the left figure of figure [ fig : mirrorcorresp4 ] ) .     and @xmath29,width=566 ]    the partial compactification @xmath29",
    "is intuitively constructed by identifying the opposite sides of the toric web diagram ( the right figure of figure [ fig : mirrorcorresp4 ] ) .",
    "then its mirror curve is a full compactification of the @xmath38-punctured @xmath39 by gluing the punctures in pairs , forming a genus @xmath1 curve .",
    "the mirror equation indeed embeds the mirror curve into its jacobian surface as the theta divisor by the abel  jacobi map .",
    "we observe that the complex moduli space of the syz mirror has a rich structure , which can be studied via the toroidal torelli map @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the the moduli space of stable genus @xmath1 curves and @xmath42 is the voronoi compactification of the moduli space @xmath43 of principally polarized abelian surfaces .",
    "for instance , the large complex structure limit corresponds to the stable genus @xmath1 curve obtained by gluing @xmath1 copies of @xmath39 s at 3 points .",
    "it is contained in the maximal degeneration of the abelian surfaces ( gluing of @xmath1 copies of @xmath44 s along 3 @xmath39 s ) as the theta divisor ( the left figure of figure [ fig : lcsl ] ) .    , width=283 ]    [ rem : hiv ] in the physics literature @xcite , hollowood  iqbal",
    " vafa constructed the local calabi ",

    "their supporting arguments are based on @xmath45 different techniques : matrix models , geometric engineering and instanton calculus . in this paper",
    "we take the geometric syz approach to derive the mirrors , and our result agrees with theirs for @xmath29 .",
    "the advantage of our mathematical work is that not only the mirror is constructed geometrically , but also we obtain a closed formula of the generating function @xmath36 of the open gromov ",
    "witten invariants , which has interesting modular properties but was not captured in the physics argument .",
    "[ rem : aak ] the syz mirror construction in the reverse direction has been carried out by abouzaid  auroux  katzarkov ( * ? ? ? * theorem 10.4 ) .",
    "namely , they consider the zero locus @xmath46 of the riemann theta function in an abelian variety @xmath47 and take the blowup of @xmath48 along @xmath49 ( which plays the role of the conic fibration above ) .",
    "their general theory applied to this example provides a lagrangian fibration on the total space and its syz mirror , which turns out to be the local calabi ",

    "there are no non - constant holomorphic spheres in the conic fibration .",

    "a version of homological mirror symmetry for the varieties of general - type was formulated by kapustin ",
    "orlov  yotov @xcite and",
    "it was proven for genus @xmath1 and higher curves by seidel @xcite and efimov @xcite respectively . as an application of the syz mirror pairs , we obtain the landau  ginzburg mirrors of general - type hypersurfaces in the polarized abelian varieties .",
