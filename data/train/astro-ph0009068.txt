    "nfw95 investigated the structure of clusters of galaxies in @xmath5-body simulations of the standard cold dark matter cosmology . from the virial radius , @xmath6 , down to @xmath7 , they found that the dark matter profiles of equilibrium clusters followed the form @xmath8 characterized by a single scale , @xmath9 .",
    "the nfw profile has a central density cusp , ( @xmath10 ) , shallower than the singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath11 ) , but gradually turns over and becomes steeper ( @xmath12 ) at large radii .",
    "dc91 had earlier found both features in higher resolution simulations of galaxies , which they fit with a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile , @xmath13    nfw96 found that the density profiles of equilibrium dark matter halos spanning a mass range from dwarf galaxies ( @xmath14 ) to rich clusters ( @xmath15 ) could be described by equation  ( [ proportionality ] ) .",
    "they suggested that this profile was a universal form for dark matter halos .",
    "nfw97 found that the nfw profile also fit simulated halos for a variety of cdm cosmologies .",
    "other numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have generally agreed with the nfw profile .",
    "however , higher resolution simulations @xcite have suggested somewhat steeper central slopes , though still shallower than the singular isothermal sphere . in the highest resolution simulations @xcite , the central density profile is @xmath16 with @xmath17@xmath18 .    it is important to test the predicted universal form of dark matter halos through observations .",
    "there have been a number of tests on cluster scales .",
    "bartelmann96 showed that gravitational lenses with the nfw form could produce the radial arcs seen in some clusters , but noted that the narrowness of observed tangential arcs might pose a problem .",
    "wnb99 found that both the radii and width of tangential arcs could only be reconciled with the nfw profile if clusters with low velocity dispersion ( @xmath19 ) had massive ( @xmath20 ) central galaxies , increasing the slope of the central density profile .",
    "observations of galaxy number density profiles @xcite , and x - ray surface brightness and temperature profiles @xcite seem generally consistent with the nfw profile . on somewhat smaller mass scales , mahdavi99 studied a sample of 20 galaxy groups , and concluded that the nfw profile successfully reproduced their x - ray emission and the density and velocity distributions of their galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , the measured rotation curves of dwarf spiral galaxies imply constant density cores which are inconsistent with the hernquist , nfw , and singular isothermal sphere profiles @xcite .",
    "similar results have been found for low surface brightness galaxies @xcite . since observational limits on the gas and stellar masses indicate that these galaxies are dominated by dark matter , these results pose a serious challenge to the universality of the nfw profile .",
    "ejection of baryons by supernova explosions might lead to formation of a flat core @xcite , although this suggestion has been criticized as unrealistic @xcite , especially in the more massive low surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that profiles with a shallow cusp , @xmath21 , fit both the observations and their simulations .",
    "however , higher resolution simulations have not confirmed the simulations , instead showing a steep divergence , @xmath22 @xcite .    both simulations and observations",
    "highlight the need for tests of the nfw profile over a wide range of masses and radii .",
    "some tests , such as strong lensing by clusters , are very sensitive to the mass profile at small radii , @xmath23 .",
    "others , such as the x - ray temperature profiles reported to date , are limited by finite spatial resolution , and are more useful as probes at intermediate and large radii .",
    "we propose another test of the nfw profile at small radii : statistics of gravitational lensing by groups .",
    "the dramatic images of lensed arcs observed in clusters are familiar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "groups are less massive than clusters and thus have smaller lensing cross sections .",
    "however , clusters are rare objects , making up a small fraction of the matter in the universe , while groups are much more numerous .",
    "others have considered lensing of quasars by groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "cooray99 has made predictions of the number of arcs on the whole sky , but has restricted his attention to clusters with mass @xmath24 , modeled as singular isothermal spheres .",
    "bl00 have estimated the probability of lensing of galaxies observable with the next generation space telescope by singular isothermal spheres of galaxy mass and higher .",
    "keeton , noting that the nfw profile has a smaller lensing cross section than the singular isothermal sphere , particularly at lower masses , has suggested that this lower cross section may explain the lack of observations of giant arcs in groups as compared to clusters .",
    "we will see that the difference in cross sections is due to the difference between the two profiles at small radii .",
    "this sensitivity to the inner part of the density profile makes the statistics of lensing by groups a potential test of the inner portions of the nfw profile in groups . by calculating lensing rates for both the nfw and sis models , we hope to span the range of central profiles seen in simulations .",
    "we consider the hubble deep field as a tool for studying lensing by groups .",
    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ) provides high - resolution images and photometry taken by the hubble space telescope in four spectral bands , f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w ( each labeled according to the approximate wavelength in nm of the peak spectral sensitivity of its filter ) .",
    "the photometry extends to @xmath25 limits of @xmath26 to @xmath27 in the @xmath28 magnitude system ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one to three magnitudes deeper than current ground - based images @xcite .",
    "this depth allows detection of a large number of ordinary galaxies at redshifts @xmath29 .",
    "early estimates of the optical depth for lensing at these redshifts suggested that the hubble deep field should contain between three and 10 gravitationally lensed galaxies with multiple images @xcite .",
    "several groups have identified possible lens systems in the hdf on the basis of morphologies and colors .",
    "hogg96 have applied a semi - automated technique based on the class survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to identify lens candidates .",
    "they cite a system with an arc @xmath30 from an elliptical galaxy , and a possible counter image @xmath31 on the opposite side , as the most likely of the 24 candidates examined so far , and also mention another elliptical and arc separated by @xmath32 ( but without a counter image ) .",
    "zmd97 identified three candidates by visual inspection , including a system of four blue galaxies separated by @xmath33 , as well as the two systems mentioned by @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent spectroscopy with the low - resolution imaging spectrograph on the keck telescope ruled out the first two candidate systems and provided inconclusive evidence on the third .",
    "this led @xcite to conclude that there might be no more than one multiply - imaged galaxy in the hdf down to an @xmath28 magnitude of 27 in f814w , similar to the magnitude of the candidates examined .",
    "cqm99 calculated the number of multiply - imaged galaxies expected due to lensing by galaxies , modeled as singular isothermal spheres , and have used the paucity of apparent lensed galaxies to place a lower limit on the difference , @xmath34 , between the matter density in the universe , @xmath35 , and the cosmological constant , @xmath36 .",
    "since foreground galaxies and groups of galaxies can both contribute to lensing of background galaxies , the actual number of lensed galaxies would be an upper limit on each contribution .",
    "even allowing for the possibility of failure to identify some lensed galaxies , this upper limit appears likely to be quite low .",
    "we want to know if such a limit can distinguish between nfw and the singular isothermal sphere density profiles for groups .",
    "we therefore calculate the number of galaxies in the hubble deep field expected to have multiple images due to lensing by groups ( and clusters ) of either profile . in  2 , we describe the details of our calculation and our underlying assumptions .",
    "we present the results in  3 , and discuss how they depend on the choice of lens profile and cosmology in  4 . in  5 , we summarize our conclusions and prospects for future work .",
    "we discuss the basic elements which determine the lensing probability : the cosmology , the lens population , and the source galaxy redshifts . finally , we combine these elements to find the number of galaxies in the hubble deep field expected to have multiple images .",
    "we consider three different basic cosmologies : a standard cdm model with @xmath37 ( scdm ) , a low - density open model with @xmath38 ( ocdm ) , and a flat model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath36cdm ) . in all three cases ,",
    "we assume a hubble constant , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and a baryon density of @xmath43 inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis and the deuterium abundance in quasar absorption line systems @xcite .",
    "we discuss the abundance of groups and clusters , their density profiles , and the cross section of an individual lens .",
    "we are primarily interested in groups , since they are more numerous .",
    "however , given the universal nfw form of dark matter halos found in simulations , we treat both groups and clusters as halos in a continuum in mass .",
    "we calculate the abundance of halos as a function of mass , or mass function , using the method of @xcite . at early times , the universe is homogeneous with only small density perturbations @xmath44 with respect to the mean density , @xmath45 .",
    "the press - schechter method relates these density perturbations at large @xmath46 , where their evolution can be described by linear theory , to the highly nonlinear ( @xmath47 ) collapsed structures at low redshifts . despite its simplifying assumptions , the press - schechter method reproduces the mass function found in simulations @xcite .",
    "the press - schechter method is based on the spherical model for collapse of a homogeneous perturbation , known as the spherical top - hat model .",
    "such a perturbation is unaffected by the isotropic universe outside , so it behaves as a friedmann universe of its own with mean density @xmath48 and expansion rate @xmath49 .",
    "a sufficiently dense perturbation will be bound , and will turn around after a finite time , @xmath50 . without pressure support ,",
    "the perturbation would collapse to infinite density in a collapse time @xmath51 . due to pressure",
    ", the perturbation is instead assumed to reach virial equilibrium by the same time , @xmath52 .",
    "we are interested in the abundance of virialized halos at a given redshift , @xmath46 . for a given cosmology ,",
    "the collapse time of a spherical perturbation depends on its overdensity , with the densest perturbations collapsing first . at early times ,",
    "when the overdensity of the perturbation , @xmath53 is much less than @xmath54 , its evolution can be described by linear perturbation theory .",
    "while the spherical model describes the nonlinear evolution of @xmath55 , perturbations can still be characterized by the extrapolation @xmath56 of @xmath57 to @xmath58 in linear theory . in the spherical model , perturbations for which @xmath56 exceeds a threshold @xmath59 will virialize at redshift @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 relates the overdensity in linear theory to the highly nonlinear collapse . for the @xmath60 case",
    ", @xmath59 can be obtained analytically in terms of the age of universe , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ( kochanek 1995 ) . for the @xmath36cdm case , we calculate its inverse , @xmath63 , @xcite and solve for @xmath64 numerically .",
    "of course , the universe does nt consist of a single homogeneous spherical perturbation .",
    "it is characterized by the overdensity field @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the position in a co - moving coordinate system such that @xmath67 corresponds to unperturbed hubble flow .",
    "the press - schechter model assumes that @xmath65 is a gaussian random field at large @xmath46 .",
    "its fourier components , @xmath68 are therefore uncorrelated and drawn from gaussian distributions with variance @xmath69 .    to connect this picture to the spherical collapse model , we smooth @xmath65 using a spherical top - hat window function of co - moving radius @xmath70 , or a physical radius of @xmath71 , corresponding to a mass scale @xmath72 .",
    "the press - schechter method assumes that matter at @xmath66 will become part of a halo of mass @xmath73 at redshift @xmath46 , provided that @xmath73 is the largest mass scale for which the smoothed overdensity at @xmath66 exceeds the threshold from the spherical model .",
    "the mean overdensity , @xmath74 , within a sphere of co - moving radius @xmath70 will also have a gaussian distribution , so the probability of @xmath75 exceeding @xmath64 is readily calculated .",
    "the variance , @xmath76 or @xmath77 , of the @xmath75 distribution , is related to the power spectrum , @xmath78 , by @xmath79 where @xmath80    the probability that a given spherical region will collapse depends on the ratio of @xmath81 to @xmath59 .",
    "thus , we must also extrapolate @xmath81 to @xmath82 in linear theory by extrapolating the power spectrum in equation  ( [ mass_fluctuations ] ) . ignoring factors independent of @xmath83 and @xmath46 ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath84 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the linear growth function , and @xmath87 , which describes the scale - dependent evolution , is called the transfer function .",
    "we assume a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum @xmath88 at high redshift @xmath89 .",
    "we use a bbks @xcite transfer function with the shape parameter , @xmath90 , defined by @xmath91 of @xmath92 for @xmath39 and @xmath93 for @xmath37 .",
    "we also consider an @xmath37 model with a lower value of @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "we normalize the power spectrum by fixing @xmath81 on a scale of @xmath96 .",
    "for each cosmology , the value of @xmath97 is chosen to reproduce the observed abundance of clusters as a function of their x - ray temperature @xcite , yielding @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 for scdm , ocdm , and @xmath36cdm , respectively .",
    "finally , the number of halos per co - moving volume , @xmath101 , as a function of the virial mass , @xmath73 , and the redshift , @xmath46 is @xmath102    the resulting mass functions are shown in figure  [ mass_function ] for redshifts of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we consider groups and clusters by restricting our attention to the mass range from @xmath0 to @xmath105 .",
    "we will see that the number of lensed galaxies predicted is not sensitive to the upper limit of this range , because of the exponential cutoff in the mass function for @xmath106 .",
    "the lower limit on the mass will have a significant effect only for the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "= .44      we consider two choices for the density profiles of the lens halos , a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with @xmath107 characterized by a one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath108 , and a profile of the form found by @xcite with @xmath109 characterized by a scale radius , @xmath9 , and normalization , @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the critical density at redshift @xmath46 , and we use @xmath112 instead of @xmath64 to avoid confusion with the overdensity for spherical collapse .",
    "our press - schechter mass function gives , for each redshift , the co - moving number density of halos , @xmath113 , with virial mass between @xmath73 and @xmath114 .",
    "we need to fix the free parameters of the density profile in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath46 .",
    "one constraint is simply that the profile have the correct virial mass . in the spherical top - hat collapse model , the density at virialization , @xmath115 ,",
    "can be calculated using the virial theorem and conservation of energy .",
    "it depends only on the redshift , @xmath46 , and on the cosmology ( see @xcite for the @xmath36cdm case ) .",
    "the virial radius , @xmath116 , is fixed by @xmath117 .",
    "then we can write the virial mass condition as @xmath118    for the singular isothermal sphere , this condition is sufficient to fix the one free parameter , @xmath108 . for the nfw profile , however , we need additional information .",
    "nfw97 have investigated the relationship between the normalization , @xmath112 , and the mass @xmath119 within a radius @xmath120 containing a mean density of 200 times the critical density @xmath111 . for a wide variety of cosmologies",
    ", they find that @xmath112 and @xmath119 are well correlated .",
    "while the precise relation depends on cosmology , it can be fit by @xmath121 where the formation redshift , @xmath122 , is defined as the redshift by which a fraction @xmath123 of the halo mass has accumulated , according to press - schechter formalism of @xcite .",
    "this redshift is given implicitly in terms of the error function , @xmath124 , by @xmath125 } } = { { \\rm erfc}}^{-1 } \\left ( { 1 \\over 2 } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the variance of the fractional mass fluctuations on mass scale @xmath73 in the spherical top hat model , defined in @xmath126 .",
    "for @xmath127 , this simplifies to @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "note that while @xcite referred to @xmath119 as the virial mass and @xmath120 as the virial radius , the overdensity with respect to the critical density @xmath130 at virialization is only equal to @xmath131 for standard cdm .",
    "unfortunately , the relation between @xmath119 and @xmath132 depends on the normalization @xmath112 of the profile .",
    "we initially approximate @xmath133 by @xmath73 in solving equation  ( [ nfwnormalization ] ) for @xmath134 .",
    "given @xmath112 , we can solve equation  ( [ virial_mass ] ) for the remaining free parameter , @xmath9 .",
    "we then use @xmath112 and @xmath9 to find a new approximation for @xmath119 , and repeat .",
    "this procedure converges rapidly , with only a few percent change in the parameters on the first iteration , and tenths of a percent thereafter .      for each density profile",
    ", we find the projected surface mass density , @xmath135 , as a function of the projected radius from the center of the lens .",
    "the lens properties are determined by the convergence , @xmath136 , where @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 are angular diameter distances to the source , to the lens , and from the lens to the source , respectively . for the @xmath36cdm case",
    ", we calculate the angular diameter distances according to @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , it is convenient to choose an arbitrary length scale @xmath141 in the image plane , and a corresponding scale @xmath142 in the source plane . in units of these length scales ,",
    "the source position , @xmath143 , and the image position , @xmath144 , are related by the lens equation , @xmath145 where the lens potential , @xmath146 , satisfies a poisson equation @xmath147 . for an axisymmetric lens",
    ", @xmath146 depends only on radius , and the source , lens , and image positions are collinear .",
    "using the divergence theorem , equation  ( [ vector_lens_equation ] ) simplifies to the one - dimensional form @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are both signed quantities , and @xmath151 is the dimensionless mass inside a cylinder of dimensionless radius @xmath152 .    when comparing different profiles , we must use dimensional quantities .",
    "the dimensional source position , @xmath153 , and image positions , @xmath154 , are related by @xmath155 \\\\ & = & { d_s \\over d_l } \\xi \\left [ 1 - { \\overline \\sigma ( \\xi ) \\over \\sigma _ { \\rm cr } } \\right ] .{\\label}{dimensional_lens_equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is the mass within a cylinder of radius @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is the mean surface density within the cylinder .",
    "figure  [ lens_equation_plot ] shows the lens equation  ( [ dimensional_lens_equation ] ) for nfw and sis profiles of the same mass and lens and source redshifts .",
    "the particular choice of mass and redshifts , explained in @xmath159 , is unimportant here .",
    "a point source at a particular position @xmath160 relative to the center of the lens will have an image at each @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "the cross section for multiple imaging is simply the area of the region of the source plane for which the lens equation has multiple solutions .    at locations in the source plane where @xmath163 , so that @xmath164 is tangent to the horizontal , the number of images changes by two .",
    "such locations are called radial caustics and the corresponding curves in the image plane are called radial critical curves .",
    "if the surface density , @xmath135 , decreases with radius , the slope @xmath165 is monotonic increasing with @xmath166 .",
    "thus , there is a single caustic radius , @xmath167 , where the number of images changes from one to three . outside this caustic radius",
    ", there is no multiple imaging . when the source is centered on the lens ,",
    "so @xmath168 , the two outer images merge to form an einstein ring .",
    "the radial critical curve is always inside the einstein ring radius , for @xmath135 monotonic decreasing .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere is a special case , because @xmath169 is constant and does not go to @xmath103 at @xmath170 . as a result",
    ", it has no radial caustic and its central image is suppressed .    for the singular isothermal sphere , which has no intrinsic length scale",
    ", we make the usual choice of @xmath171 , set by the ratio of the mass normalization to the critical density . then @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "it is easy to show that the lens equation has two image position solutions when @xmath174 , so the cross section is @xmath175 .",
    "bartelmann96 gives formulas for @xmath176 and @xmath177 of the nfw profile , for @xmath141 chosen equal to the scale radius , @xmath9 . since the nfw profile has one length scale , and the ratio @xmath178 introduces a second , the lens properties no longer scale with @xmath141 the way they do for the singular isothermal sphere . for each lens - source pair , we must solve numerically for the caustic radius , @xmath179 , and cross section , @xmath180 , for multiple imaging .",
    "the lensing cross section depends on the source redshift through the distances @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the critical density , @xmath183 .",
    "several groups @xcite have obtained photometric redshift estimates for the galaxies in the hdf , with results largely consistent with available spectroscopic redshifts and with each other @xcite .",
    "we use the @xcite catalog of galaxies in the hubble deep field .",
    "the selection criteria for this catalog are described in detail in @xcite and @xcite . in brief , @xcite start by identifying sources which exceed a minimum surface brightness threshold in a smooth version of the f814w hdf images . to include low surface brightness galaxies , they choose a threshold @xmath184 , corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio of only @xmath185 per pixel , but require 10 contiguous pixels above this threshold .",
    "this combination of criteria is roughly equivalent to an isophotal magnitude limit of @xmath186 . to estimate the completeness limit of the sample , they test the sensitivity of the identification procedure to the smoothing length and threshold .",
    "they find that the list of objects identified is insensitive to these parameters for @xmath187 .",
    "fly99 therefore restrict their sample to @xmath188 .",
    "near the edge of the hubble deep field , they impose a stricter magnitude cut of @xmath189 , citing poorer quality images",
    ".    fly99 estimate photometric redshifts for the @xmath190 galaxies in the interior and an additional @xmath191 galaxies near the edge meeting these criteria .",
    "they supplement the hubble space telescope images with infrared photometry from the observations of @xcite to break degeneracies in the photometric redshift estimation .",
    "they also include published spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath192 of the sources in the catalog .",
    "we use their full catalog of @xmath193 spectroscopic or photometric redshifts as our source redshift distribution .",
    "we discuss the optical depth for lensing , observational selection effects , magnification bias , and the expected number of multiply - imaged galaxies in the hubble deep field .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath194 , for multiple imaging of a source at fixed redshift , @xmath195 , is simply the fraction of the source plane area , @xmath196 , covered by discs of radius @xmath179 around each lens position .",
    "the cross section , @xmath197 , of an individual lens is @xmath198 .",
    "multiplying by the number of groups of mass @xmath73 and redshift @xmath199 in a co - moving volume @xmath200 , we obtain @xmath201 the total optical depth is small , so the lensing probability is equal to @xmath202 .",
    "we obtain the total number of lensed galaxies expected by multiplying the number distribution of source galaxies @xmath203 by the lensing probability , @xmath194 , and integrating over the source redshift , @xmath195 .",
    "since we are interested in the number of lensed galaxies in the hubble deep field , we can use the delta - function distribution of the discrete catalog of photometric redshifts from @xcite directly , without smoothing , changing the normalization , or correcting for redshift clustering .",
    "the searches for lensed galaxies in the hdf do not explicitly describe criteria for identifying lens candidates .",
    "this makes it difficult to estimate their detection efficiency .",
    "the best we can do is to try to infer the criteria from the characteristics of the actual candidates selected .",
    "the lens candidates are selected on the basis of morphology and color .",
    "specifically , they include two types of systems , those consisting of closely spaced galaxies of similar colors , which might be multiple images of a single source galaxy , and those consisting of a red elliptical accompanied by a blue arc , which might represent a lens galaxy and an image of a lens source respectively @xcite .",
    "we use multiple imaging as a proxy for the latter case as well as the former .",
    "several observational selection effects might interfere with the detection of multiple imaging , thereby reducing the number of lens systems observed .",
    "the point spread function of the hdf images is approximately @xmath204 in width , so even closely spaced images should be easily resolved . in any case , the typical image separation increases with lens mass , so spatial resolution is less likely to be a problem for detecting lensing by groups , even in ground - based images .",
    "a more likely concern is the possibility that lens systems with widely spaced images might be missed . even in the two systems identified by @xcite as multiple imaging candidates , with separations of @xmath205 and @xmath206",
    ", spectroscopy showed that the putative multiple images were actually different galaxies .",
    "the search for lens candidates may have been limited , explicitly or implicitly , to small separations , since such false - positive cases would be more likely at larger separations .    the description of a red elliptical as a possible lens galaxy suggests that the searches may have focused on lensing by galaxies .",
    "however , since groups contain galaxies , this might not be a serious bias .",
    "again , without quantitative criteria , it is difficult to estimate the reduction in detection efficiency due to such factors .",
    "we therefore calculate the total number of multiply - imaged galaxies , keeping in mind that the number actually observed may be lower .",
    "another related concern is magnification bias .",
    "lens magnification increases the angular area of an image , while leaving its surface brightness unchanged , thereby increasing the flux .",
    "if the search for lensed galaxies is flux limited , sources which would lie below the detection threshold in the absence of lensing might be detected , provided the magnification is sufficient .",
    "this magnification bias differs from other selection effects in that it actually increases the number of observed lenses .",
    "the extent of the effect depends on the number of unlensed sources as a function of magnitude , at each redshift . for lensing of quasars ,",
    "where the luminosity function is steep , magnification bias is a significant effect @xcite .",
    "keeton found that this was particularly important for the nfw profile , which produces higher mean magnifications than the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "the key question is whether or not a particular lens survey is flux limited . unlike quasars , galaxies in the hubble deep field are spatially resolved , so a surface brightness threshold might be a better detection criterion . since lensing does not change surface brightness , such a survey would have no magnification bias .    on the other hand ,",
    "some aspects of lens surveys might impose a flux limit implicitly .",
    "for instance , the smaller the image flux , the harder it would be to obtain a spectrum of sufficient quality to confirm or rule out lensing .",
    "zmd97 used the flux of the faintest component of their three candidates systems to estimate an effective magnitude limit of @xmath207 . with only eight components between these three systems , they do not attempt to prove that their sample is flux limited",
    ". however , that seems to be their assumption . finally ,",
    "as discussed in @xmath208 , @xcite smooth the hdf images and use an isophotal magnitude limit so as not to exclude low surface brightness galaxies . while this does not directly affect the lensing searches",
    ", it is another possible argument in favor of a flux limit .",
    "nevertheless , it is difficult to decide whether the lens searches are better described by a flux limit or by a surface brightness limit .    to calculate the magnification bias for a flux limited lens survey , we would need to know the joint distribution with respect to magnitude and redshift of sources several magnitudes fainter than the effective magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "however , the photometric redshifts from the hubble deep field are the deepest redshift survey available , extending to @xmath209 of @xmath27",
    ". we could impose a cut on the lens survey , eliminating candidates with magnitudes too close to @xmath27 , but this would further reduce the already small number of observed lens systems .",
    "alternatively , we could extrapolate the observed magnitude - redshift distribution to fainter limits .",
    "since magnitude and redshift are correlated , the already relatively small redshift catalog would have to be divided into redshift bands .",
    "great care would be required to ensure that the extrapolation was not dominated by noise due to small number statistics and redshift clustering in the redshift catalog .",
    "in addition , any such extrapolation beyond the data carries an unknown risk of systematic error .    considering these difficulties , we make the simpler choice of assuming a surface brightness limited sample for lensed galaxies searches in the hdf .",
    "we therefore neglect the effect of magnification bias on the expected number of lensed galaxies detected .",
    "even so , we might be concerned about magnification bias because of the explicit magnitude cut in the @xcite redshift catalog . however , the effect on the number of galaxies observed is not the same as the effect on the number of lensed galaxies observed .",
    "the lens magnification reduces the effective luminosity limit of the flux - limited sample , but at the same time decreases the surface number density of sources .",
    "btp95 pointed out that the observed number of galaxies @xmath5 per unit solid angle is @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the number in the absence of lensing , @xmath212 is the local magnification , and @xmath213 is minus the logarithmic derivative , @xmath214 , of the galaxy luminosity function , @xmath215 , with respect to luminosity . the slope @xmath216 depends of course on the source population .",
    "it is possible to select source populations of red galaxies for which @xmath216 differs from unity , but for the faint blue galaxies which dominate the source population at high redshifts , @xmath216 is found empirically to be very close to @xmath54 @xcite . for such galaxies , the two effects of magnification cancel , purely by coincidence .",
    "thus the redshift distribution is unaffected by lensing .",
    "in table  [ expected ] , we show the total number of lensed galaxies expected .",
    "groups with singular isothermal sphere profiles produce roughly @xmath131 times as many lensed galaxies as those with nfw profiles . even for the sis lenses ,",
    "the expected number of lensed galaxies is @xmath4 .    to understand the results , and to make predictions for future surveys , we show the distribution of lensed galaxies with respect to various properties of the lens and source .",
    "in figure  [ mass_distribution ] we show the expected number distribution of lensed galaxies per unit logarithmic interval in the lens mass .    in figure  [ lens_redshift ] , we show the distribution of lenses with respect to redshift for nfw and sis groups .",
    "the nfw lens distributions peak near @xmath199 of @xmath217@xmath218 and are strongly suppressed at @xmath219 .",
    "compared to the nfw results for the corresponding cosmology , each sis lens distribution peaks at a redshift lower by @xmath220 , and shows only linear suppression at low redshifts .",
    "the difference at small redshifts reflects the lower lensing efficiency of the less singular nfw profile when the critical density , @xmath221 , is small @xcite .",
    "given sufficient statistics ( and constraints on the cosmology ) , the difference in lens redshift distributions is a potential discriminant between nfw and sis lenses .",
    "figure  [ source_redshift ] shows the redshift distributions of the lensed galaxies in the scdm case .",
    "for comparison , the distribution in the nfw case has been multiplied by @xmath131 , so that it has the same total area as in the sis case .",
    "the other three cosmologies have very similar distributions , apart from the normalization .",
    "figure  [ source_redshift ] reflects the discrete nature of our catalog - based source redshift distribution .",
    "the distribution of lensed galaxies in the nfw case is more strongly suppressed at low source redshift , again reflecting the lower lensing efficiency of the nfw profile when @xmath183 becomes small .",
    "the probability distribution of angular separations between the two brightest images of lensed galaxies is shown in figure  [ image_separations ] .",
    "most of the image separations are greater than @xmath222 , so there should be no difficulty in resolving the images even with ground - based observations .",
    "figure  [ amplification ] shows the cumulative probability distribution , @xmath223 , of lensed galaxies with total amplification greater than @xmath224 .",
    "the much larger amplifications in the nfw case are consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "what makes the nfw profile so much less efficient at lensing than the singular isothermal sphere ?",
    "both the shape and the normalization of the profile matter . to see this ,",
    "consider a specific example , a halo with mass @xmath225 at @xmath226 , typical of our nfw lenses , in an ocdm universe .",
    "figure [ surface_density ] compares the mean surface density , @xmath227 , within a cylinder of radius @xmath228 for nfw and sis halos of this mass and redshift .",
    "both have the same mass within the sphere of radius @xmath229 . however , the sis profile has a larger mean surface density both at small radii ( @xmath230 ) and at large radii ( @xmath231 ) .    at large radii , this is due to the more rapid ( @xmath232 ) falloff of the nfw density profile . at small radii ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "our typical nfw lens has a scale radius , @xmath9 , of @xmath233 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the nfw profile has a mean surface density @xmath234 for fixed density , @xmath235 , at small radii , @xmath236 still depends , albeit logarithmically , on the scale radius .",
    "this occurs because , for density profiles @xmath237 which are sufficiently shallow at small radii , @xmath237 at intermediate radii @xmath238 can still contribute significantly to @xmath239 at radii @xmath23 . for a profile with @xmath240 at @xmath23 and @xmath241 at @xmath242 , and @xmath243 ,",
    "the ratio between the contribution to @xmath239 from intermediate radii and the contribution from small radii is roughly @xmath244 .",
    "as @xmath245 approaches @xmath54 , there will still be a fractional contribution of @xmath246 as long as @xmath247 .",
    "thus , the lower mean surface density of the nfw profile at small radii is due to the less rapid ( @xmath10 ) divergence of the nfw profile , but is also influenced by the falloff at large radii .",
    "the key question is which portion of @xmath248 determines the multiple imaging cross section .",
    "the caustic radius , @xmath249 , is determined only by the surface mass distribution within the radial critical curve .",
    "locating the radial critical curve , @xmath250 , requires solving the lens equation  ( [ dimensional_lens_equation ] ) for @xmath163 .",
    "this occurs where @xmath251 as long as the surface density decreases with radius , @xmath252 is always inside the einstein ring radius , @xmath253 , defined by @xmath254 . for a background galaxy at @xmath255 ,",
    "the value of the critical surface density , @xmath183 , is shown as a horizontal line in figure  [ surface_density ] , which intersects @xmath248 for the nfw profile at @xmath256 . at all points inside this radius ,",
    "@xmath236 is smaller for the nfw profile than the singular isothermal sphere .    to see how this difference in @xmath248 in the lens plane affects the cross section in the source plane , we need to refer back to the lens equation  ( [ dimensional_lens_equation ] ) .",
    "it is useful to define the offset @xmath257 , so @xmath258 is independent of @xmath161 .    for positive @xmath161",
    ", we can solve equation  ( [ offset_definition ] ) for @xmath161 and rewrite the lens equation as @xmath259 evaluating this at the radial critical curve , using equation  ( [ radial_critical_condition ] ) , we find @xmath260 for the sis profile , this simplifies to @xmath261 . for our typical nfw profile , since @xmath262 , and @xmath263 , we can use equation  ( [ central_surface_density ] ) for @xmath236 , to find @xmath264 since @xmath265 is constant , we can compare it to @xmath266 at the critical radius for the nfw lens .",
    "the multiple lensing cross section is @xmath267 , so @xmath268 ^ 2 \\ > \\right | _ { \\xi = \\xi_r ( { \\rm nfw } ) } .{\\label}{cross_section_ratio}\\ ] ] thus , the smaller cross section for the nfw lens is caused by the smaller mean surface density , @xmath236 , as well as by the smaller proportionality constant between @xmath249 and @xmath269 .",
    "the dimensional lens equation  ( [ dimensional_lens_equation ] ) is shown in figure  [ lens_equation_plot ] for the particular lens parameters above .",
    "the range of source positions for which there are multiple images for the nfw profile is just over one - eighth of that for the sis profile , and thus the ratio of lensing cross sections , @xmath270 , is @xmath271 , in agreement with equation  ( [ cross_section_ratio ] ) .",
    "how do these results depend on mass ? in figure  [ cross_sections ] , we show the two cross sections as a function of mass , again for @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "the nfw cross section increases roughly as @xmath274 for this choice of redshifts , whereas the sis cross section increases as @xmath275 , so @xmath276 increases with mass .",
    "this trend is evident in figure  [ mass_distribution ] . for the sis profile ,",
    "the increase in @xmath197 with mass is roughly offset by the decrease in the number of groups , so the distribution of lens masses is relatively flat or slightly declining between @xmath0 and @xmath277 . because the nfw cross section depends more strongly on lens mass than the sis cross section , its distribution increases with mass , peaking near @xmath278 .",
    "the low efficiency of the nfw lenses at small masses , where halos are most abundant , further reduces the number of lensed galaxies . even for a cluster with @xmath279 , @xmath280 is still only @xmath281 , and such clusters are sufficiently rare in the press - schechter model that they contribute little to the optical depth for lensing .",
    "our calculated @xmath270 ratios agree with those of @xcite .",
    "given that the highest resolution simulations favor central profiles @xmath282 with slope @xmath283 , is interesting to ask how the cross section depends on @xmath245 for @xmath243 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not a simple question to answer .",
    "as we have seen for the nfw lens , the multiple imaging cross section depends not only on the shape of the mean surface density profile , @xmath239 , but on its normalization at small radii . for halos normalized to the same virial mass , fixing @xmath248 at small radii requires both @xmath245 and the concentration @xmath284 , which determines how @xmath237 turns over from @xmath285 at small radii to @xmath286 at large radii . for the nfw profile , the relationship of @xmath9 to virial",
    "mass has been investigated extensively through simulations of many halos @xcite .",
    "bullock00 have also investigated this relationship , and have found consistent results at @xmath82 , but lower mean concentrations at high redshift .",
    "the higher resolution simulations of @xcite , who find a density profile of @xmath287 } , \\label{moore_profile}\\ ] ] require more computing time , and therefore have been done for only a few halos , so the dependence of the concentration , @xmath288 , on the virial mass has not been investigated systematically .",
    "moore99 do quote a value of @xmath289 for a single cluster with virial mass @xmath290 at @xmath82 in a standard cdm simulation .",
    "the multiple imaging cross section for a halo of that mass and concentration , but at @xmath291 in our ocdm cosmology , is shown by the asterisk in figure  [ surface_density ] .",
    "this cross section is @xmath292 times greater than the corresponding nfw profile , but still @xmath293 times smaller than the sis profile .",
    "if , as for an nfw cluster of the same mass , the concentration declines by @xmath294 from @xmath295 to @xmath291 , the cross section would be reduced by @xmath296 , as shown by the plus sign in figure  [ surface_density ] .",
    "because of the differences in cosmology and redshift , these comparisons offer at best a rough idea of the multiple imaging cross section for profiles with inner slopes intermediate between the nfw profile and a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "more precise quantitative predictions would require further high - resolution simulations to determine the variation of the concentration with halo mass and redshift .",
    "consider the distribution of nfw lens masses shown in figure  [ mass_distribution ] .",
    "the distributions for open cdm ( dotted ) and @xmath36cdm ( dashed ) are quite similar up to normalization .",
    "the @xmath36cdm case has about @xmath297 more lenses , due to the larger path length and greater angular diameter distance to a given redshift .",
    "the shape of these distributions reflects the competition between the increase in @xmath197 with mass , and the decreasing abundance of halos . at low masses , the rapid increase in the nfw lensing cross section with mass dominates , and the distributions rise until @xmath298@xmath299 , where they are truncated by the high - end cutoff in the mass function ( see figure  [ mass_function ] ) .    given that standard cdm has the smallest path length and angular diameter distances of the three models",
    ", we expect it to have the fewest lenses .",
    "surprisingly , our calculations indicate slightly more total lensed galaxies in the scdm case than in the @xmath36cdm case ( see table  [ expected ] and figure  [ mass_distribution ] ) .",
    "the reason can be seen in figure  [ mass_function ] .",
    "compared to the @xmath36cdm and ocdm cases , the scdm mass function cuts off at a lower mass due to the lower value of @xmath97 .",
    "its lens mass distribution therefore peaks at a lower mass @xmath300 .",
    "however , the scdm mass function also has a steeper slope , due to a larger value of @xmath62 and thus @xmath301 , resulting in a _",
    "larger _ number of groups on smaller mass scales ( by a factor of @xmath302 for @xmath303 and @xmath291 ) when the power spectrum is normalized to @xmath97 . to verify this explanation ,",
    "we have included a low-@xmath95 cdm model with @xmath304 and @xmath97 still equal to @xmath305 , but with @xmath306 . the low-@xmath95 model ( dot - dashed ) , barely visible at the bottom of figure  [ mass_distribution ] ,",
    "does indeed have far fewer lenses than the other cosmological models .",
    "our low mass cutoff at @xmath307 does have an effect on the total number of lensed galaxies in the sis case .",
    "extending the mass function down to @xmath308 would increase the number of sis lenses expected by a factor of @xmath309 for @xmath304 and of @xmath185 for @xmath310 .",
    "by contrast , this change would increase the number of nfw lenses by only 10 percent for scdm , with a smaller effect for the other cosmologies .",
    "the difference between our two @xmath304 models highlights the sensitivity of predicted lensing by groups to the value of the shape parameter , @xmath95 , as previously noted by @xcite . with the power spectrum normalization fixed by the cluster temperature function ,",
    "increasing @xmath95 produces significantly more groups .",
    "ecf96 note that the normalization of the cluster temperature function constrains @xmath97 well , since the co - moving radius @xmath311 is close to the cluster scale , but that the slope of the temperature function , and thus @xmath95 , is not well determined .",
    "measurements of the galaxy correlation function favor @xmath312 @xcite as does the cluster mass function inferred from the group luminosity function and an assumed constant mass - to - light ratio @xcite .    as an aside",
    ", we note that the @xcite mass function has a similar shape to our press - schechter distribution in the ocdm case , but @xmath313 more low mass groups at @xmath82 .",
    "however , the press - schechter mass function evolves significantly between @xmath82 and @xmath291 where our lens redshift distribution peaks , whereas the @xcite mass function , inferred from low @xmath46 observations , contains no redshift evolution information . as an experiment ,",
    "we have repeated our calculation using the @xcite mass function and simply ignoring evolution . in the ocdm case , with nfw lenses ,",
    "this yields @xmath314 times as many lensed galaxies as the press - schechter mass function , rather than @xmath185 times as many , greatly exaggerating the number of lensed galaxies expected . a realistic calculation of lensing using a group mass function determined observationally at low @xmath46 would require the addition of evolution information .    turning things around , lensing may be able to constrain the group mass function and thus @xmath95 .",
    "kochanek95 finds that values of @xmath95 between @xmath315 and @xmath316 are also needed to reconcile large separation quasar lensing statistics with the cobe normalization of @xmath97 in an scdm universe . to constrain @xmath95 with lensing of galaxies by groups",
    ", we would need enough lensed galaxies to detect this effect and disentangle it from the effects of other unknown parameters .",
    "the small total number of strong lenses expected in the hdf prevents us from making such inferences .",
    "groups and clusters with the nfw profile are far less efficient at producing lensed galaxies than singular isothermal spheres of the same mass .",
    "the ratio , @xmath270 , of multiple imaging cross sections ranges from @xmath317 for a @xmath307 group to @xmath2 for a @xmath318 cluster .",
    "the lower efficiency of nfw lenses is a result of their smaller surface density profile , @xmath248 , for radii much smaller than the scale radius , @xmath9 .",
    "this , in turn , is due to the shallower density profile , @xmath237 , at small radii ( although it also depends logarithmically on @xmath9 , which determines the more rapid falloff in density at large radii ) . in principle",
    ", this makes the statistics of multiple imaging a sensitive test of the central density profile of groups .",
    "unfortunately , the number of galaxies in the hubble deep field is not sufficient to perform such a test . lensing by sis groups might be detected with a sample a few times larger .",
    "however , to detect nfw groups would require more than @xmath131 times as many galaxies .",
    "no deep space - based survey of this size is expected in the near future .",
    "ground - based surveys would be limited to much lower redshift sources , and would therefore suffer from smaller optical depths for multiple imaging .",
    "still , they might compensate with sufficiently larger fields containing many more galaxies .",
    "for example the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is expected to obtain photometry for @xmath319 galaxies , as compared to @xmath320 in the hubble deep field .    on the other hand ,",
    "lensing searches in the hdf illustrate the difficulties of finding lensed galaxies .",
    "two of the three candidates systems identified by morphology and colors were subsequently ruled out by spectroscopy . in both cases ,",
    "hypothetical multiple images turned out to be different galaxies .",
    "such a high rate of false positives limits the number of true lens systems which can be identified in a given amount of spectroscopic follow - up time .",
    "it is unclear whether the different galaxies were physically associated or not . in either case , false positives due to chance superposition are more likely at the larger image separations expected for lensing by groups .",
    "in contrast , with lensed quasars , coincidences are negligible , although pairs of physically associated quasars are still an issue @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high luminosity and prominent spectral features of quasars simplify spectroscopic confirmation . the sdss is also expected to yield a large sample of quasars , which may be a more promising way of detecting lensing by groups .",
    "finally , weak lensing statistics may complement strong lensing by probing the outer portions of the mass profiles of groups .",
    "a number of detections of weak lensing by galaxies @xcite and even one early detection of weak lensing by groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been reported .",
    "we will discuss the detection and analysis of weak lensing by groups in a subsequent paper .",

    "<S> we investigate strong lensing of galaxies in the hubble deep field by foreground groups and clusters of galaxies with masses from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . over this mass range , </S>",
    "<S> groups with the profile of navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 ) are less efficient than singular isothermal spheres at producing multiple images of galaxies , by factors of @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference highlights the sensitivity of the lensing cross section to the central density profile . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , with either profile we find that the expected number of galaxies lensed by groups in the hubble deep field is at most @xmath4 , consistent with the lack of clearly identified group lens systems . </S>"
