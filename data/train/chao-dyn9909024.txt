    "in order to have dissipation the interaction should be with dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "we can introduce an effective harmonic - bath as follows : @xmath26 the effective - noise model ( [ e7 ] ) as well as the effective harmonic - bath model ( [ e8 ] ) can be treated analytically using the feynman - vernon ( fv ) formalism . _",
    "the reduced dynamics of the particle _ is obtained after averaging over realizations of the stochastic potential ( in case of ( [ e7 ] ) ) , or by elimination of the environmental degrees of freedom ( in case of ( [ e8 ] ) ) .",

    "for the time dependent hamiltonian @xmath44 energy is not a constant of the motion .",
    "changes in the actual energy @xmath63 reflect ` real ' dynamical changes as well as parametric changes .",
    "therefore it is useful to introduce the following definitions : @xmath64 the actual energy change can be calculated as follows : @xmath65 the actual energy change @xmath66 can be viewed as a sum of parametric - energy - change  @xmath67 , and reduced - energy - change  @xmath68 . @xmath69",

    "the sudden approximation implies that for short times @xmath75 can be replaced by _ unity _ if it operates on an initial microcanonical state . for longer times",
    "we have @xmath77 here there is enough time for the evolving distribution to adjust itself to the changing hamiltonian .",

    "the adiabatic approximation becomes worse and worse as time elapses due to the transverse spreading across the energy surface .",
    "we shall see that @xmath53 is the breaktime for the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we recall the formula for the actual energy change @xmath79 we assume an initial microcanonical preparation which is characterized by an energy  @xmath7 . the energy spreading after time @xmath80",
    "is : @xmath81 now we make the following approximation @xmath82 the validity of this approximation is restricted by the condition @xmath83 which will be discussed later .",
    "the energy spread is @xmath84 the ballistic spreading on short time scales just reflects the parametric change of the energy surfaces .",
    "the diffusive spreading on longer times reflects the deviation from the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath85",
    "it is possible to argue that the energy distribution @xmath86 obeys the following diffusion equation : @xmath87 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{for $ t \\gg t_{{\\mbox{\\tiny erg}}}$}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we transform to the proper phase space variable @xmath88 , this diffusion equation gets the standard form .",
    "the average energy is calculated via @xmath89 and consequently @xmath90 using the expression for @xmath91 we obtain the following fd relation @xmath92 the actual value of @xmath16 is obtained by averaging @xmath93 according to the distribution @xmath86 . the standard version of the fd relation @xmath94 is obtained if @xmath86 is of the canonical type .",
    "it is instructive to apply the fd relation for the ` piston ' example .",
    "the bath degrees of freedom is a gas particle whose mass is @xmath95 .",
    "the faces of the piston are characterized by their total area .",
    "the piston is moving with a constant velocity @xmath52 inside a @xmath96-dimensional cavity .",
    "for simplicity we treat the collisions as ` one - dimensional ' and omit @xmath96 dependent pre - factors @xcite .",
    "an illustration of one collision with the piston is presented in fig.[f_col ] .",
    "each collision can be either from the left or from the right side .",
    "the resultant stochastic force which is experienced by the piston is a sum over short impulses : @xmath97 \\ \\delta(t - t_{{\\mbox{\\tiny col } } } )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the duration of each impulse is equal to the penetration - time upon a collision with the ( soft ) faces of the piston . if successive collisions with the piston are uncorrelated , then the correlation time @xmath38 is equal to the average duration of an impulse .",
    "the main steps in the analysis of the multi - collision process are summarized in fig.[f_col ] as well .",
    "it is easily verified that the fd relation between @xmath93 and @xmath98 is satisfied .",
    "note however that a proper application of kinetic theory is essential in order to obtain the correct geometrical factors involved @xcite .",

    "this becomes most evident once we consider a variation of the above example : if successive collisions with the piston are correlated , for example due to bouncing behavior , then it is still a relatively easy task to estimate @xmath98 for the @xmath101 case , and then to obtain @xmath93 via the fd relation . on the other hand , a direct evaluation of @xmath93 using kinetic considerations is extremely difficult , because in calculating @xmath108 it is essential to take into account the correlations between successive collisions .",
    "the derivation of the fd relation consists of two steps : the _ first step _ establishes the local diffusive behavior for short ( @xmath83 ) time scales , and @xmath91 is determined ; the _ second step _ establishes the global stochastic behavior on large ( @xmath109 ) time scales .",
    "the various time scales involved are illustrated in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "the classical breaktime @xmath53 is defined as follows : @xmath110 for @xmath111 the systematic energy change @xmath112 becomes larger than the energy spreading @xmath113 , and the local analysis becomes meaningless .",

    "= 2.5 in    from the discussion above it follows that the validity of the classical derivation is restricted by the non - trivial slowness condition @xmath114 .",
    "alternatively , it is more useful to regard the non - trivial slowness condition using the point - of - view of section 5 . this point - of - view",
    "is further explained below , and can be easily generalized to the quantum - mechanical case . for @xmath104 the average of @xmath11 does not vanish , and therefore its correlator should include an ` offset ' term .",
    "namely , @xmath115 .",

    "the latter condition is equivalent to the non - trivial slowness condition @xmath114 .    in the quantum - mechanical analysis",
    "we can use the same two - steps strategy in order to derive a corresponding fd relation .",
    "_ we are going to concentrate on the first step_. it means that our objective is to establish a crossover from ballistic to diffusive behavior at the time @xmath117 .",
    "the classical analysis in section 8 is essentially ` perturbation theory ' .",
    "we can follow formally the same steps in the quantum - mechanical derivation , using heisenberg picture .",
    "however , quantum - mechanical perturbation - theory is much more fragile than the corresponding classical theory , and we have typically @xmath118 . therefore , the quantum mechanical definition of slowness ( @xmath119 ) is much more restrictive than the classical requirement ( @xmath114 ) . in the regime",
    "where perturbation theory fails we have to use a non - perturbative theory .",
    "in particular we are going to find the sufficient conditions for having detailed quantal - classical correspondence ( qcc ) using semiclassical considerations .",
    "in order to go smoothly from the classical theory to the quantum mechanical theory it is essential to use proper notations . from now on we shall use the variable @xmath120 instead of @xmath7 . given @xmath21 , the energy surface that corresponds to a phase - space volume @xmath121",

    "the classical derivation in section 8 applies also in the quantum - mechanical case provided @xmath11 is treated as an operator .",

    "= 1.5 in    now we shall characterize the main features of a generic core - tail spreading profile .",

    "one should realize that the power - law behavior of the tail is ` fast ' enough in order to guarantee that @xmath269 is independent of the tail s cutoff .",
    "the cutoff does not have any effect on the evolving core . on the other hand , the second moment @xmath270 , unlike @xmath269 ,",
    "is predominantly determined by the tail s cutoff , and it is independent of the core structure .",
    "in order to extend perturbation theory beyond @xmath246 it is essential to eliminate the non - perturbative transitions within the core .",

    "one obtains then the classical fokker planck equation @xmath378 \\ \\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fokker planck equation is just a continuity equation with an added noise term that reflects the effect of the stochastic force .",
    "the fokker planck equation is equivalent to solving langevin equation as well as to the gaussian propagator  ( [ e97 ] ) .",
    "wigner function may have some modulation on a fine scale due to an interference effect .",
    "the standard text - book example of a two slit experiment is analyzed in @xcite . in case of the zcl model ( @xmath379 ) ,",
    "the propagator is the same as the classical one , and therefore we may adopt a simple langevin picture in order to analyze the dephasing process .",
    "alternatively , we may regard the dephasing process as arising from gaussian smearing of the interference pattern by the propagator . in case of the dld model ( finite  @xmath332 )",
    "we should distinguish between two possible mechanisms for dephasing :    * scattering ( perturbative ) mechanism .",
    "* spreading ( non - perturbative ) mechanism .    actually , it is better to regard them as mechanisms to maintain coherence . the first mechanism to maintain coherence is simply not to be scattered by the environment .",
    "the second mechanism to maintain coherence is not to be smeared by the propagator .",
    "the first mechanism is absent in case of the zcl model .",
    "let us discuss how coherence is lost due to the scattering mechanism .",
    "the discussion is relevant if wigner function contains a modulation on a momentum scale much finer than @xmath364 , else @xmath332 becomes non - relevant and we can take it to be infinite .",
    "one should observe that such modulation is not affected by the friction , but its intensity decays exponentially in time .",
    "this is based on inspection of either the propagator  ( [ e99 ] ) , or the equivalent master equation  ( [ e100 ] ) . in the latter case note that the convolution with @xmath370 can be replaced by multiplication with @xmath380 .",
    "the decay rate is @xmath381 this is the universal result for the dephasing rate due to the ` scattering mechanism ' .",
    "it is universal since it does not depend on details of the quantum - mechanical state involved .",
    "however , the validity of this result is restricted to the high temperature regime , where the wna can be applied . extensions of this result , as well as discussion of dephasing at low temperatures can be found in @xcite .",
    "the effective - bath approach suggests that there is a universal description of quantal brownian motion .",
    "if indeed the effective - bath approach is universally applicable , it is implied that @xmath382 meaning that the motion under the influence of chaotic environment is effectively the same as the motion under the influence of dynamical disordered environment .    at this stage",
    "the conditions for the validity of ( [ e_open ] ) are yet unclear .",
    "it is interesting however to emphasize the practical implications of such claim .",
    "the starting point should be a specification of the effective correlation scale @xmath332 .",
    "for the ` piston ' example the most obvious _",
    "guess _ is @xmath383 one may estimate now the coherence time using the substitution @xmath384 where @xmath95 is the mass of the gas particle , and @xmath385 is the mean path - length between collisions with the piston .",
    "the result is @xmath386 where @xmath387 is the de - broglie wavelength of the gas particle .",
    "note that we are assuming the wna , and therefore we must satisfy @xmath388 , where @xmath389 is the de - broglie wavelength of the piston .",
    "the ( effectively ) disordered nature of the environment is significant only within the time domain @xmath390 .",
    "the non - trivial effect that is ` predicted ' by solving the dld model is that the reduced propagator has a coherent ` unscattered - component ' plus a smearing scattered - component. the latter is created due to the exchange of momentum - quanta of typical magnitude @xmath364 .",
    "assuming ` hard walls ' ( in the sense of ( [ e_guess ] ) ) we get the result @xmath391 and @xmath392 .",
    "this is a very funny result since it has a trivial _ classical interpretation _ in terms of the actual ( piston ) model , whereas within the effective - bath approach it appears as a genuine quantum - mechanical effect",
