    "since 1970 it is generally agreed that atomic diffusion driven by radiative accelerations plays a role in creating the anomalous surface abundances of f , a and b stars ( michaud 1970 ) .",
    "however , some 40 years later , many questions remain as to the exact behavior of many physical processes within the stable envelopes of these stars .",
    "in fact , for fm stars , two competing scenarios which have each had their share of success are presently being confronted to observations .",
    "the `` classical '' scenario watson ( 1971 ) suggests that separation occurs below the h - he convection zone . in this framework ,",
    "models which only consider atomic diffusion without extra mixing generate predicted anomalies that are 3 - 5 times larger than the ones observed ( turcotte et al .",
    "1998 ) , thus implying that there is at least one competing process that slows the effects of separation .",
    "this lead to more recent models ( richer et al .",
    "2000 , richard et al .",
    "2001 ) in which turbulence enforces mixing down to about 200000k . in these models",
    ", it is implied that separation occurs deeper in the star .    like turbulence or rotation",
    ", mass loss is another macroscopic process that can reduce inhomogeneities on the surface of these stars .",
    "however , until now , only static stellar models have included the effects of mass loss ( michaud et al .",
    "1983 , alecian 1996 for ca and leblanc et alecian 2007 for sc ) with the latter paper showing that the actual depth at which separation occurs is still uncertain .",
    "with self - consistent models of fm stars ( 6500k@xmath2@xmath27000k ) we will show that mass loss can reduce predicted abundances to the observed levels .",
    "the first aim is to see to what extent observations can constrain the importance of mass loss and if its effects can be deciphered from the ones encountered with turbulence .",
    "we will also discuss the implications of our models on the depth of chemical separation .",
    "the following is a continuation of the montreal stellar model development project ( richard et al . , 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the evolutionary calculations take into detailed account the time - dependent variations of 28 chemical species and include all effects of atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations .",
    "these are the first fully self - consistent stellar models which include mass loss .",
    "models were calculated for 1.35m@xmath0 , 1.40m@xmath0,1.45m@xmath0 and 1.50m@xmath0 .",
    "all models have evolved from the homogeneous pre - main sequence phase with a solar metallicity ( z=0.02 ) .",
    "the mass loss rates considered varied from 1@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath0yr@xmath5 to 3@xmath310@xmath6m@xmath0yr@xmath5 .",
    "the mass loss is considered spherical , chemically homogeneous and weak enough not to disturb burning in the core or stellar structure .",
    "the net effect is the appearance of an outward flowing wind which is represented as an advection term in the transport equation . due to numerical instabilities resulting from very large advection velocities in the surface convection zone",
    ", some adjustments must be made in order to avoid convergence problems .",
    "the method is well described in charbonneau ( 1993 ) .",
    "the transport equation then becomes :",
    "@xmath7}\\\\ & & + \\rho ( s_{nuc}+s_{w})c , \\label{charb2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with a neumann condition ( no flux ) imposed at the surface and with @xmath8 and @xmath9 defined as : @xmath10 @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the time and depth dependent concentration , @xmath13 is density , @xmath14 is the total diffusion coefficient , @xmath15 is the total velocity field , @xmath16 is wind velocity , @xmath17 is the mass of the scz , @xmath18 is the mass loss rate , @xmath19 is a source / destruction term linked to nuclear reactions and @xmath20 is a destruction term linked to mass loss .",
    "one of the effects of mass loss is to drag elements which tend to sink . because the diffusion velocity must be greater than the wind velocity for separation to occur , the greater the mass loss the deeper we have to look to see any effects of separation . on the other hand ,",
    "elements which are naturally supported by the radiation field will be pushed into the surface convection zone and evacuated through the stellar surface . as seen in figure 1 , models",
    "in which only atomic diffusion is included lead to larger surface abundances anomalies than in the presence of mass loss .",
    "for instance , after 0.8 gyr of evolution predicted anomalies ( in terms of the original abundance ) for the plotted elements are respectively , without mass loss and with a mass loss rate of 5@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath0yr@xmath5 , @xmath30.2 and @xmath30.3 for li , @xmath30.25 and @xmath30.3 for ca , @xmath34 and @xmath31.5 for fe .",
    "we also see that for the given stellar mass , a mass loss rate of 5@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath0yr@xmath5 is sufficient to reduce anomalies by a factor of 1.5 to 3 , and a mass loss rate of 3@xmath310@xmath6m@xmath0yr@xmath5 practically flattens the surface abundances .",
    "the 1.5m@xmath0 model is particularly interesting because it corresponds to the minimum mass at which iron accumulation due to the spatial distribution of its radiative acceleration causes the appearance of a convection zone ( figure 3 , left panel ) . as mentioned above , recent evolutionary models ( richer et al .",
    "2000 , richard et al . 2001 and",
    "michaud et al .",
    "2005 ) have successfully reproduced observations by considering that turbulence homogenizes abundances from the surface down to a temperature that corresponds to the bottom of this iron convection zone ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , in this context , separation must take place deeper than the classical model in which separation occurs above this convection zone .",
    "both of these scenarios have been tested with mass loss .    in figure 2",
    "we have compared 6 different models of 1.5m@xmath0 to the observed abundances of the star @xmath1uma ( hui - bon - hoa 2000 ) from the ursa major moving group which has an age of approximately 500myr ( monier 2005 ) and @xmath227000k ( vant veer - menneret et mgessier 1996 ) .",
    "there are 4 models in which separation is allowed immediately below the h - he convection zone ( 3 mass loss models , and one diffusion only model ) , as well as 2 models in which mixing was enforced to @xmath21 or deeper ( which is the case for the turbulence model ) .",
    "it appears from the plot that the two models which best fit the data are the turbulence model as well as the model with a mass loss rate of 1@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath0yr@xmath5 with enforced mixing down to the bottom of the fe convection zone .",
    "however the model with a mass loss rate of 2@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath0yr@xmath5 and without any turbulent mixing does very nearly as well .",
    "we also see that the model with the mass loss rate 1@xmath310@xmath4m@xmath0yr@xmath5 without homogenized abundances between convection zones can reproduce quite effectively 3 of the 5 observed abundances",
    ". it would therefore be premature to rule out the validity of the classical scenario in the context of mass loss . as we can see in the same plot , observations between al and ar would help in identifying if the zone between the h - he and fe convections zones is mixed .",
    "another important result is that turbulence and mass loss models have noticeable element to element differences which is necessary if we wish to eventually constrain the importance of both these processes .",
    "finally , the models with the mass loss rate of 10@xmath6m@xmath0yr@xmath5 flatten the abundance profiles in such a way that they can no longer reproduce observations ( see also cayrel et al .",
    "our results seem to suggest that the scenario in which separation is to take place at @xmath23k in fm stars must be favored over the classical scenario . in this framework ,",
    "a mass loss rate of the order of the solar mass loss rate is able to reduce predicted anomalies to the observed abundances of @xmath1uma .",
    "however , it is too early to eliminate the possibility of separation below the h convection zone .",
    "abundance determinations between al and ar could help distinguish between these two regimes .",
    "it is also shown that turbulence and mass loss affect anomalies differently , though the discrepancy is slight in the models shown . once again",
    ", more observations are required to further constrain these two mechanisms .",
    "more massive models in the range where observations are not as scarce are also needed .",
    "they are currently being calculated . in any case",
    ", it is shown that reasonable mass loss rates can effectively reduce the anomalies predicted by atomic diffusion models to the observed levels .",
