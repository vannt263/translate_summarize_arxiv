    "the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is believed to be a new state of matter of the strong interaction produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the qgp is a plasma containing electrically charged quarks ; its electromagnetic property is an important aspect of its nature . among all observables for the qgp",
    ", the high - energy photons may provide clean probes to hot and dense medium @xcite .",
    "although the electromagnetic nature gives us an impression that the interaction between low - energy photons and the medium would be weak , it could be more significant than we previously thought due to extremely high temperature and density of the qgp .",
    "so the optical properties of the qgp are not a trivial issue .",
    "one of the most important optical properties is the refractive index ( ri ) , which measures the speed of light in a medium relative to vacuum .",
    "the negative refraction ( nr ) is a very interesting phenomenon of materials which was first theoretically proposed by veselago in 1968 @xcite .",
    "the physical nature of such a property is that the electromagnetic phase velocity is in the opposite direction to the energy flow .",
    "the nr leads to many interesting phenomena in materials such as the modified fraction law @xcite and bremsstrahlung radiation , the reverse doppler shift @xcite and cherenkov radiation , etc .. the most striking application of the nr materials is the optical cloak @xcite , an attractive topic in science fiction .",
    "recently , the strongly coupled plasma has been found to have negative refraction , which was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and afterwards followed in refs .",
    "@xcite in holographic model .",
    "furthermore , it was proven to be a possible generic phenomenon in charged hydrodynamical systems @xcite .    motivated by the above finding in the strongly coupled plasma , in this paper we will calculate within the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) perturbation theory the ri via the electric permittivity @xmath3 and the magnetic permeability @xmath4 .",
    "since a qgp is composed of electrically charged quarks instead of magnetic monopoles , the electric and magnetic sector do not play equal roles .",
    "we will show that the physical definition and behavior of @xmath4 ( and then the ri ) can be very different due to specific magnetic response of the qgp .",
    "therefore a plasma can be classified into two types : magnetizable and nonmagnetizable . in a magnetizable plasma",
    "the magnetization is realistic , while in a nonmagnetizable plasma it does not make physical sense any more .",
    "we will calculate the ri and analyze their properties in these two types of plasmas .",
    "if the qgp is magnetizable , we will show that there is a frequency pole @xmath0 in @xmath4 and then the ri , leading to the nri in the range @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the wave number , but there are no propagating modes in the nri region . in a nonmagnetizable plasma , @xmath4 and the ri are always positive .",
    "our results are different from the holographic treatment in following respects .",
    "first , in our perturbative treatment with the htl , the qgp is magnetizable in the frequency range where the nr takes place .",
    "the definition of the magnetic permeability is normal and the magnetization density makes physical sense in this region .",
    "in contrast , the plasma considered in the holographic theory @xcite is nonmagnetizable or strongly dielectric , therefore the landau - lifshits description @xcite of the magnetic permeability has to be applied .",
    "second , the dispersion relation with the nri behaves differently .",
    "there is a frequency pole below @xmath5 for @xmath4 and the ri in our approach , but there is no such a singularity in the holographic treatment @xcite .",
    "finally we fail to find any propagating modes with the nri within the htl perturbation theory in both magnetizable and nonmagnetizable cases .",
    "this marks the main distinction from a strongly coupled plasma where the nr is shown to exist in the holographic theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : em - wave ] we briefly review the formalism of computing electromagnetic properties in an isotropic and anisotropy medium . in sec .",
    "[ sec : htl ] , we calculate the ri from the htl self - energy of photons in magnetizable and nonmagnetizable plasmas . in sec .",
    "[ sec : anisotropy ] , we generalize our calculation to an anisotropic qgp .",

    "this scenario applies to magnetizable materials .",
    "another description was proposed by landau and lifshits : that the magnetization @xmath16 loses its usual physical meaning as a magnetic moment density , and so does the magnetic permeability @xmath17 , when the characteristic electromagnetic wavelength @xmath18 is large enough to violate @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the magnetic susceptibility .",

    "the medium effect is characterized by the photon self - energy @xmath40 .",
    "one can then extract the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability from the action @xmath41 .",
    "the self - energy must satisfy the ward identity @xmath42 in which @xmath43 is a 4-momentum . in an isotropic medium , the general solution of eq.([eq : ward ] ) for @xmath40",

    "the full inverse propagator for the photon is @xmath50 where the last term is the gauge - fixing term and @xmath51 is the gauge parameter .",
    "here we choose the covariant gauge @xmath52 so the gauge - fixing term does not appear in the action .    in magnetizable case , the action can then be evaluated with @xmath53 as @xmath54,\\label{eq : full_action_weldon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath55    in the nonmagnetizable case or the landau - lifshits scenario , we obtain @xmath56,\\label{eq : un - mag}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 then the effective electric permittivity and magnetic permeability can be extracted from @xmath22 @xmath58 where we have expanded the @xmath59 in powers of @xmath2 by @xmath60      suppose there is one special direction @xmath61 in a most simple anisotropic medium .",

    "it is known that the sign change of @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponds to a cross over between different branches of the square root , from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , or from the positive refractive index to the negative one .",
    "we can see in the following that the sign of @xmath3 and @xmath4 have a significant physical implication .",
    "the phase velocity is defined by @xmath95 whose sign is the same as that of @xmath96 .",
    "but the direction of the energy flow or the poynting vector is not affected by the sign of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in a medium with small dissipation , the direction of the energy flow coincides with that of the group velocity , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a positive time - averaged energy density and @xmath99",
    "so the direction of the phase velocity can be opposite to the energy flow or the group velocity if we have , e.g. , a negative phase velocity and a positive group one or vice versa @xmath100 this criterion of the antiparallelism for the phase velocity and the energy flow is equivalent to a better definition called the depine - lakhtakia ( dl ) index @xcite , @xmath101 when @xmath102 , the directions of the phase velocity and the energy flow are opposite .",

    ", @xmath4 has the normal physical meaning , but it fails to make physical sense in the nonmagnetizable plasma . in the magnetizable plasma , @xmath4 has a pole at @xmath0 below the plasma frequency @xmath5 . when @xmath126 , both @xmath104 and @xmath103 become negative but no propagating modes exist .",
    "a frequency forbidden band or a gap with imaginary @xmath104 or @xmath123 is in the range @xmath133 , where electromagnetic waves are damped . for @xmath131 , @xmath104 becomes complex and the medium is dissipative . in the nonmagnetizable plasma ,",

    "the damped region or the gap is in the range @xmath196 .    in contrast , the negative refraction is present for the nonmagnetizable plasma in the strongly coupled plasma in the holographic description , where the gap is not significant and the refractive index smoothly connects the negative to positive refraction region .",
    "this implies that the medium is almost transparent to the light at all frequencies .",
