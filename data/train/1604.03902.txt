    "the desire for single - shot ultrafast electron diffraction ( ued ) beamlines ( @xmath8 30 fs , @xmath9 electrons ) capable of imaging molecular and atomic motion continues to push the development of both photocathode and cold atom electron sources @xcite . in the case of photoemission sources , advances in the development of low mean transverse energy ( mte )",
    "photocathodes @xcite , as well as both dc gun and normal conducting rf gun technology @xcite now bring the goal of creating single shot electron diffraction beamlines with lengths on the order of meters with in reach .    for such devices , the required charge and beam sizes at the cathode imply transporting a space charged dominated beam .",
    "building on the successful application of multi - objective genetic algorithm ( moga ) optimized simulations of space charge dominated beams used in the design and operation of the cornell photoinjector @xcite , as well as the optimization of a cryo - cooled dc gun ued set - up @xcite , we apply the same techniques to a 100 mv / m 1.6 cell ncrf gun followed by a 9 cell , @xmath0 buncher cavity .",
    "we use a mte value of 35 mev , a value considered achievable through the use of multi - alkolide photocathodes operated near threshold @xcite .",
    "this work is structured as follows : first , we briefly review the definition of coherence and the expected scaling with critical initial laser and beam parameters .",
    "next , a detailed description of the beamline set - up , and the parameters for optimization is given .",
    "the results of an initial round of optimizations of the emittance vs. bunch charge , as well as detailed optimizations of the coherence length vs. final bunch length for a charge of @xmath1 electrons follow . from the optimal fronts , an example simulation for @xmath7 fs",
    "is presented .    throughout this work",
    "all fields and particle distributions are assumed symmetric about the beam line ( @xmath10 ) axis . for a beam passing through a waist the coherence length expression reduces to @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 nm is the _ reduced _ compton wavelength of the electron . for a bunch charge @xmath13 , we write the minimum allowed initial laser spot size in the charge saturation limit for the two limiting cases of a short and long initial laser pulse , as defined by the aspect ratio of @xmath14 . in this expression @xmath15 is the accelerating field at the cathode and @xmath16 is the laser pulse length @xcite .",
    "the minimum laser spot size is then given by : @xmath17 plugging this into the expression for the cathode emittance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mean transverse energy of the photoemitted eletrons , and combing that with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lcxemit ] ) yields @xmath20 here the factor @xmath21 is included because the above expression assumes the emittance at the cathode can be recovered at the sample . for beams with a large degree of emittance preservation , @xmath22 , and",
    "the above expression gives the correct scaling @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , the ncrf gun based ued setup consists of a 1.6 cell 2.856 ghz ncrf gun followed by a buncher cavity placed between two solenoid magnets @xcite . for all simluations , the maximum allowable peak cathode field",
    "is set to 100 mv / m and the cathode mte is fixed to 35 mev for all simulations .",
    "for the buncher model , we used the dimensions of the first cell in the slac linac , specified in table 6 - 6 in @xcite , repeated a total of 9 times , to make a 9-cell @xmath23 traveling wave buncher cavity .",
    "the fieldmaps were generated in poisson superfish .",
    "to model solenoids similar to those in @xcite we use an analytic form for the on - axis solenoid field from a sheet of current with radius @xmath24 and length @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , to the solenoid field maps , and created a custom gpt element featuring the analytic result of the off - axis expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : solfield ] ) to third order in the radial offset @xmath28 .",
    "note that given the small beam sizes along each set - up ( @xmath29 mm ) determined by the optimizer , the first - order expansion of the solenoid fields accurately describes the beam dynamics .",
    "+   +    additionally , the use of such small mte and laser spot size values requires estimating the effect of disorder induced heating ( dih ) near the cathode .",
    "this issue is discussed later in the results section .",
    "in order to produce the best coherence length performance from the ued setup , multi - objective genetic optimizations were performed using general particle tracer and the same optimization software used previously in @xcite . for these simulations ,",
    "the optimizer varied the laser rms sizes , beamline element parameters and positions .",
    "additionally , the optimizer was allowed to arbitrarily shape both the transverse and longitudinal laser distributions , based on the same method described in @xcite .",
    "table-[tab : beamline_params ] displays the beamline parameters varied .",
    "fig.[fig : stdx ] shows the transverse rms beamsize along the beamline , as well as the initial transverse laser profile and the final electron transverse distribution at the sample .",
    "the optimizer chose a roughly flattop transverse laser profile with @xmath30 @xmath3 m .",
    "[ fig : stdt ] shows the rms bunch length , and the initial temporal current profile produced by the laser , and the electron beam current profile at the sample .",
    "the use of the buncher cavity allows for a fairly constant bunch length along the beamline up to the cavity , where the buncher applies an energy chirp which results in the bunch being compressed by the time it reaches the screen .",
    "the relevant emittance data along the beamline is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : enx ] . shown in solid blue is the transverse emittance with the angular velocity due to the solenoid removed . shown in green",
    "is the slice emittance , computed by averaging over the ( 30 ) individual slices .",
    "as anticipated , the individual slice phase spaces are nearly aligned at the sample .    in this work ,",
    "we have presented a multi - mev ncrf gun based single shot ued layout determined by moga optimization of space charge simulations . for a long final bunch of 500 fs or less , the emittance for this set - up scales as @xmath31 , in agreement with the predictions for a long initial beam aspect ratio @xcite .",
    "emittances as low as 2 - 5 nm were found for final bunch lengths ranging from roughly 500 down to 5 fs for a bunch charge of @xmath1 electrons .",
    "estimates of the dih and initial beam aspect ratio show no issues for bunch lengths as small as 40 fs .",
    "in addition to computing the optimal emittances as a function of bunch length , optimizations of the coherence length as a function final bunch length produced coherence lengths suitable for single - shot ued experiments with a final electron beam spot size of @xmath2 and bunch charge of @xmath32 electrons . in particular , optimal relative coherence lengths of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 nm/@xmath3 m for a final bunch length of @xmath7 , 30 , and 100 fs , respectively , were produced .",
