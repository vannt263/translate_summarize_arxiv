    "during the last decade , it has been fully realised that the relics of the latest accretion events that contributed to the assembly of the milky way can be observationally identified and studied in detail ( see , for example * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "a blue plume of possibly young stars or blue stragglers - also typical of dwarf spheroidal galaxies - has been detected in both optical cmds .",
    "@xcite detected the blue plume population in the background of several open clusters in the third galactic quadrant .",
    "while these authors conclude that this population should be associated to the norma and perseus spiral arms of the milky way , it turns out that all the considered fields lie within the region of the sky where cma is detected ( from their table  1 @xmath20 ; @xmath21 , see pap - i and sect .  3 , below ) , and in the same range of distances as cma ( 6.0 kpc @xmath22 11.7 kpc , see pap - i , pap - ii and sect .",

    "moreover , the blue plume populations studied by @xcite appear to follow a distance - galactic longitude trend quite similar to that found here for the red clump population of cma ( see sect .  4.1.1 , below ) .",

    "moreover they detected a clear distance - radial velocity gradient among cma stars that can be explained as the effect of on - going tidal disruption of the stellar system .",
    "a significant refinement of the proper motion estimate was also obtained in pap - iv .",
    "finally , @xcite very recently obtained a new accurate estimate of the proper motion of cma and concluded that ( a ) the system has a significant component of motion perpendicular to the galactic plane ( @xmath25 km / s ) and that ( b ) this w component of the space motion of cma is in the opposite direction with respect to the expected w motion of stars associated with the galactic warp .",
    "other interesting investigations of the cma relic , not strictly related to the present work or in a too preliminary stage to be fully useful for the analysis , can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cma overdensity may be an effect of the stellar component of the galactic warp @xcite , whose broad southern maximum ( as a south / north density asymmetry ) lies in the range @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "in pap - ii and pap - iii , in particular , we showed that such a conclusion can be reached only if the distance distribution of the adopted tracers ( m giants ) is neglected and that cma is in fact an additional overdensity of different nature with respect to the large scale warp of the galactic disc . on the other hand",
    "the disentanglement of the two structures may prove difficult , limiting our possibility to obtain a detailed global description of cma and the warp ( see pap - iii , for this discussion ) .",
    "a global analysis of cma is also hampered by the large degree of contamination from galactic stars , by the high and variable extinction toward the galactic plane and by its proximity to us that imply a very low surface density in star counts per unit solid - angle of sky ( see sect .  4.4 , below ) .",
    "it is clear that a large scale study of cma using a different tracer than the m - giants used in the previous wide - field studies of the system would provide a very useful independent check of the results of pap - i and may help us to understand the relation between cma and the warp . in pap - i",
    "we showed that the red clump ( rc ) of helium - burning stars of the cma system is clearly detected in the 2mass database and in pap - ii we used the rc stars to show that cma is an independent structure , superposed on the galactic warp . here",

    "the synthetic lf has been rescaled by a factor @xmath28 to match the total number od stars in the two samples.,width=317 ]",
    "we extracted from the 2mass point source catalogue the sources comprised between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , having @xmath31 .",
    "the selected range of longitude and latitude cover the largest part of the galactic disc , avoiding only the surroundings of the galactic centre , where the stellar crowding and the interstellar extinction may prove too severe for a useful analysis in the present context .",
    "stars were selected according to the quality of the photometry and to avoid spurious and contaminated sources as in @xcite . moreover , only stars having photometric uncertainties @xmath32 mag both in j _ and _ k magnitude have been included in the sample .",
    "the magnitudes of all the stars were corrected for extinction using the colour excesses interpolated on the cobe / dirbe maps @xcite and modified according to @xcite , as done in @xcite and pap - iii .",
    "obviously a 2-dimensional extinction map can not account for the 3-dimensional distribution of the intersellar dust , thus the adopted correction may not always be good for nearby stars , but should be quite appropriate for the distant red clump stars we are interested in . the extinction laws by @xcite have been adopted . in the following j , h , and k magnitudes denote reddening - corrected magnitudes @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , unless otherwise stated . only stars with @xmath36 were retained for the analysis .    in figure  1 we show the j - k , k cmd of a low - extinction field near the centre of the cma structure .",
    "the diagram is dominated by main sequence ( ms ) stars of the galactic disc for @xmath37 , for @xmath38 the m giants are contributed by both the disc and cma , and the intermediate colour strip , @xmath39 , enclosed by continuous lines in fig .  1 , should be dominated by rc stars located at various distances . while the m giant sequence of cma can be revealed only with the subtraction of a control field symmetric with respect to the galactic plane ( pap - i ) the red clump of the system is clearly visible without subtraction in the range @xmath40 with an apparent peak around @xmath41 , as readily shown by the histogram in the left panel of fig .  1 ( dotted black line ) , in excellent agreement with pap - i . hence rc",
    "stars are very promising tracers of the cma structure . in the following discussion",
    "we will limit our analysis to the stars in the colour strip enclosing the typical rc stars , @xmath42 , as in pap - ii ( e.g. , the region enclosed within parallel continuous lines in fig .  1 ) . in the left panel of fig",
    "1 we also plotted the luminosity function ( lf ) obtained with the same selection criteria from a synthetic sample of the same region of the sky extracted from the galaxy model by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r03 , red continuous line ; see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the r03 model includes a warped and flared disc ( whose parameters have been fixed according to observations ) and the effect of the displacement of the sun with respect to the galactic plane by 15 - 16 pc ( toward the galactic north , * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that the r03 model reproduces excellently the observed lf for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , but completely lacks the strong bump around @xmath41 that we attribute to the rc of canis major .    with respect to m giants , rc stars may suffer from a larger degree of contamination by unrelated sources .",
    "while for @xmath45 the only possible contaminants for m giants are m dwarfs at faint magnitudes ( @xmath46 ) , our colour - selected rc sample may be contaminated by k giants essentially at any magnitude , and significant numbers of both m and g dwarfs can be pushed into the rc colour range by photometric errors for @xmath47 ( see * ? ? ? * and appendix a , for discussion ) .",
    "however all the results presented below are in the form of subtractions of star counts in the southern and northern galactic hemispheres .",
    "since the degree of contamination from galactic sources as a function of magnitude should be similar in both hemispheres , the subtraction should minimise any spurious effect associated with contaminants ( see appendix a , below ) .",
    "moreover , all the results presented below remain unaltered if we limit our sample to rc stars having @xmath48 , where the contamination by dwarfs is not overwhelming @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we study the problem of contamination by dwarfs in some detail , showing that ( a ) in spite of the large fraction of dwarf that may contaminate our samples and of the presence of north - south differences in the degree of contamination , the adopted technique traces trustworthy real asymmetries in the density of distant giants , for @xmath49 , and ( b ) the intrinsic asymmetry due to the @xmath50 pc displacement of the sun above the galactic plane @xcite has a negligible effect on our analysis .    on the other hand rc stars should be intrinsically more numerous than m giants and they provide a completely independent and more reliable distance scale compared to the photometric parallax of m giants ( see @xcite , @xcite , pap - i , pap - ii and pap - iii ) .",
    "if not otherwise stated , we will use in the following analysis only stars with @xmath51 to avoid the regions where the extinction is most severe .",
    "2 shows that once the @xmath51 strip is excluded , the region considered in the present analysis is largely free from high extinction regions ( e.g. where @xmath52 mag ) .",
    "since most of the structures we are interested in are enclosed in the latitude strip @xmath53 , most of the following analysis is limited to this range .",
    "note that the 2mass point source catalogue is complete down to @xmath54 @xcite , hence the luminosity range in which most of the rc stars we will consider lie ( @xmath55 ) is not expected to suffer from problems of incompleteness .     and",
    "@xmath56.,width=317 ]      it has to be noted that the origin of disc warps and the relationship between gaseous and stellar warps is far from understood @xcite . moreover the characterisation of the stellar warp of the milky way is quite poor and uncertain , mainly because of the problems inherent with the analysis of stellar fields at low galactic latitudes . finally , it is important to realise that the adopted parametrisation may describe different characteristics of the warp and may induce some confusion in the use of terms .",
    "for instance , @xcite identified the stellar warp as a sinusoidal variation of the mean latitude of their tracers ( namely iras sources ) as a function of longitude . in this case",
    "the `` maximum of the warp '' coincides with the maximum _ angular height _ above the galactic equator , similar to the parametrisation adopted when dealing with the gaseous warp . on the other hand , @xcite described the warp as the sinusoidal variation of the ratio of star counts in northern and southern galactic hemisphere as a function of longitude , hence their `` maximum of the warp '' is the region where the southern ( or northern ) projected overdensity reaches its maximum .",
    "the two definitions may provide very different views , depending on the structure of the disc and on the relative 3-d positions of the observed structures and the sun .",
    "since the cma galaxy was identified as a south / north overdensity it should be compared with the warp as a south / north overdensity (  la * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since this is the only relevant parameter in this context .",
    "the parametrisation of the amplitude of the warp as the artificial shift to apply to the galactic plane to match the star counts in the northern and southern hemisphere ( as done by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not a fair description of south / north overdensities in the present context , since it turns into a comparison of stars lying at different distances , as shown in pap - iii .",
    "hence , in the following we will always deal with cma and the warp as south / north overdensities .",
    "most of the following analysis will make use of subtracted density maps obtained form the above described sample of color - selected rc stars . in this section",
    "we will describe in detail how these maps are obtained .",
    "rc stars are widely used as distance indicators ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in pap - ii we assumed @xmath57 for the rc of cma , since , according to the theoretical models by @xcite , this interval encloses the absolute k magnitude of the rc for populations of metallicity @xmath58\\la -0.7 $ ] and age between 4 gyr and 10 gyr , i.e. the proper age and metallicity for cma ( see pap - ii ) .",
    "here we adopt the same assumption to obtain the distance of each rc star in our sample .",
    "these individual distances should be regarded with some caution since the adopted distance scale is optimised for the rc of cma and may provide misleading answers when is applied ( a ) to contaminant sources that are not rc stars ( see sect .",
    "2 , above ) , and ( b ) to rc stars outside the age and metallicity ranges outlined above . on the other hand",
    ", the range of age and metallicity of stellar populations in the outer galactic disc that produce rc stars should not be too different from that outlined above .",
    "hence , the assumed global distance scale is expected to provide a reasonable description of the overall spatial distribution of rc stars in this region of the galaxy and a reliable representation of the cma system .",
    "in particular , it should be considered that rc stars are much less sensitive to metallicity and age variations in the considered populations compared to m - giants ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "finally , it should also be recalled that in the following we will deal only with _ subtracted _ density distributions : the subtraction should cancel out many of the above effects if , as it very reasonable to assume , at a given galactocentric distance the age and metallicity distributions are similar in both galactic hemispheres .",
    "we used the distances of individual rc stars in our sample to obtain their cartesian heliocentric coordinates :    @xmath59\\ ] ]    @xmath60\\ ] ]    @xmath61\\ ] ]    in this system the coordinates of the sun are ( x , y , z)=(0.0,0.0,0.0 ) kpc and the centre of the galaxy is located at ( x , y , z)=(+8.0,0.0,0.0 ) kpc , having assumed that the distance to the galactic center is @xmath62 . to avoid any possible effect of local inhomogeneities in the vicinity of the galactic plane we also removed the stars having @xmath63 kpc .",
    "given the adopted selections this is equivalent to excluding stars within @xmath64 kpc from the sun .",
    "from these samples we computed the density of rc stars on an x , y grid with boxes of size @xmath65 , spaced by @xmath66 both in x and in y. the overlapping between adjacent boxes ensures some degree of smoothing , providing more clearly readable maps . in this way we obtained x , y density maps of the southern and northern hemisphere that can be subtracted , `` pixel - to - pixel '' , to obtain a map of the residual surface density in the x , y plane , that is residual maps of the galactic plane as seen from the galactic pole .",
    "the density at each point of the subtracted map is computed as @xmath67 note that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are a sort of `` column '' density , since at the position ( @xmath70;@xmath71 ) the derived density is equal to the number of rc stars having @xmath72 and @xmath73 , _ at any _ z within the limits of our sample .",
    "the imposed selection in latitude ( @xmath74 ) imply that the range in z sampled by different pixels of the grid varies with their heliocentric distance .",
    "in particular , at @xmath75 kpc the sampled range of z is 0.5 kpc @xmath761.5 kpc , at @xmath77 kpc : 0.9 kpc @xmath762.6 kpc , at @xmath78 kpc : 1.1 kpc @xmath763.3 kpc .",
    "it is important to realize that this has no consequence for the subtracted densities @xmath79 , since each pair of pixels to be subtracted have exactly _ the same volume_.    since a large absolute density residual ( e.g. in number ) does not necessarily imply a statistically significant signal , it is mandatory to obtain the subtracted density maps also in terms of signal - to - noise ratio , that is in units of @xmath80 :    @xmath81 where @xmath82    subtracted maps in terms of number density provide a physical idea of the extent of the detected overdensities , while subtracted maps in @xmath80 units allow us to discriminate structures that are statistically reliable and significant from those that can arise from mere statistical fluctuations .",
    "fig .  3 shows the maps of residuals obtained by subtracting the northern hemisphere density map from the southern hemisphere density map , in terms of number density ( panel a ) and in units of @xmath80 ( panel b ) .",
    "we recall here that the regions @xmath83 and @xmath84 are excluded from the present analysis . in appendix",
    "a it is shown that while the effect of contamination by dwarfs should not significantly affect subtracted density maps for @xmath49 , it may become quite relevant at fainter magnitudes . in this section",
    "we present subtracted maps that include also stars having @xmath85 to avoid abrupt distance thresholds in the proximity of the regions of interest .",
    "we caution the reader that the reliability of the maps may be drastically reduced beyond the heliocentric circle corresponding to the @xmath86 limit that is always clearly shown in figs .  3 , 4 and 5 below , as a reference .",
    "according to the results of appendix a , the contamination by dwarfs can seriously affect the maps also around @xmath87 .",
    "on the other hand , the main structures we deal with in the following analysis lie safely in the range of latitudes and distances that should be correctly probed by our subtracted - density technique ( see appendix a ) .",

    "there is also a quantitative self - consistency problem to consider .",

    "the smooth nature of the global south - north asymmetry shown to be present in this region , its galactic - scale dimensions , and the fact that a rescaled version of northern density map is a good model for it ( fig .  5 ) , strongly indicate that the surface density structure centred around @xmath13 is not a dwarf galaxy remnant ( argo ) but the effect of the warp ( and flare ) asymmetries of the galactic disc .    turning back our attention to cma",
    ", there is an interesting point that can be appreciated from the comparison of figs .  9 and 10 .",
    "while the cma structure is present in both maps , its appearance is quite different .",
    "most of the difference is just apparent and is due to the density scale adopted in fig .  8",
    ", that is best suited to provide a good view of  argo  and compress the whole structure of cma to just three levels of density .",
    "however part of the difference is real , and is due to the much larger degree of foreground / background contamination affecting the map of fig .  8 , which includes stars at any galactocentric distance .",
    "in particular , the center of the structure ( i.e. , the region of maximum density ) is shifted from @xmath168 in the distance limited map ( fig .",
    "9 , that should be closer to the actual physical structure of the system ) to @xmath169 in the all - distances map of fig .  8 , due to contamination by likely unrelated stars at various distances along the line of sight .",
    "this kind of effect should be always taken into account in studying the structure of cma , since effects due to the _ integration along the line of sight _ can significantly change the overall view of the system .",
    "in our view there are only two possible explanations for the observational evidence presented above :    1 .",
    "canis major is a strong and unexpected substructure of the outer galactic disc .",
    "this would imply that the disc hosts very dense and compact substructures of _ old stars _ ( the age should be larger than 1 - 2 gyr to have rc stars and should be larger than 4 - 5 gyr according the optical cmds , see pap - ii and @xcite )",
    ". such substructure should be very different , in nature , from usual spiral arms , for instance , that host populations dominated by very young stars .",
    "a local distorsion of the outer disc , coupled with a large scale warp , may also possibly reproduce the observed distribution of overdensities in the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "canis major is the remnant of a disrupting dwarf galaxy , as suggested in pap - i , ii , iii , and iv .",
    "this interpretation naturally fits all the observational evidence collected up to now , with particular emphasis on the size and density of the structure and to the kinematics of its stars ( see pap - iii , pap - iv and @xcite ) .    for the reasons described above and in the previous papers of this series",
    ", our preference goes to the second hypothesis , that appears to provide a much easier explanation of the whole observational scenario . in the following",
    "we will take this hypothesis as true and , on this basis , we will derive some interesting physical characteristics of cma as a stellar system .",
    "in pap - iii we obtained a distance profile of cma using m - giants as distance indicators . here",
    "we can repeat that analysis using the more reliable distance scale provided by rc stars . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "10 we show the distance distribution of the rc stars in our sample in the northern ( blue ) and southern ( red ) hemispheres , in a wide region toward the centre of cma .",
    "the southern profile shows an overall excess at any distance , with respect to the northern one , plus an additional bump peaked around @xmath170 kpc .",
    "we rescaled the northern distribution by the same factor as in fig",
    ".  5 ( e.g. , @xmath111 ) and subtract it from the southern profile .",
    "the result is shown in the lower panel of fig .  10 :",
    "the south - north excess appear to be confined within @xmath171 kpc and @xmath172 kpc .",
    "the peak of the profile is at @xmath173 kpc and the half width at half maximum is @xmath174 kpc , in excellent agreement with the results of pap - i , pap - iii and @xcite .",
    "there are a few interesting considerations that can be deduced by inspecting fig .  10",
    ":    * the distance profile of cma as obtained from its rc stars is strikingly similar to that derived from m - giants in pap - iii . even leaving aside the perfect coincidence of the peaks of the two distributions , that may be ascribed to a mere coincidence within the uncertainties associated with the two distance scales ,",
    "it remains a fact that the two independent tracers give essentially _ the same _ line - of - sight profile of the cma system .",
    "* in our various analyses we have obtained distance estimates for cma from four different and independent distance indicators . in order of accuracy : from the tip of the red giant branch in the i band ( @xmath175 kpc , pap - iii ) , from the red clump in k band ( @xmath175 kpc , present analysis ) , from the photometric parallax of m giants in the k band ( @xmath176 kpc , pap - i ) , and from main sequence fitting in the b and v bands ( @xmath177 , pap - ii ) .",
    "all of these independent methods consistently provide a distance of the centre of cma within @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "hence , the average distance of cma should be now regarded as a very reliable piece of information about this system .",
    "note that if @xmath180 is assumed , the age estimate obtained in pap - ii would shift toward older ages ( i.e. 6 gyr@xmath181 age @xmath182 gyr , instead of 4 gyr@xmath181 age @xmath182 gyr ) .     and @xmath115 , in the southern ( red ) and northern ( blue ) galactic hemisphere .",

    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "13 has the same longitude scale as fig .  9 , to allow a direct comparison .",
    "the core of the `` mock '' sgr shows a major axis of more than @xmath260 ( @xmath261 ) and the overall appearance is strikingly similar to cma .",
    "note that the limiting contour extends well beyond @xmath254 on the low longitude side , and beyond @xmath262 on the other ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "note also that the outskirts of the `` mock '' sgr galaxy extends into the northern galactic hemisphere , up to @xmath264 .    from eqn .",
    "6 the following relation can be derived between the surface brightness ( at any chosen wavelength @xmath265 ) @xmath266 , @xmath267 and the number of stars per given area in a given evolutionary phase ( @xmath268 ) for two stellar systems located at distances @xmath269 and @xmath270 : @xmath271    the second term on the right hand side of eqn .",
    "7 displays the effect of distance on the number surface density of a system of a given surface brightness . to rescale the number surface density of sgr from @xmath272 to @xmath273 we must assume @xmath274 .",
    "in the present case we find that the observed surface number density of sgr stars should be reduced by a factor 0.075 , if the galaxy is placed at the distance of cma .",
    "hence , in this case , we would observe @xmath275 rc stars deg@xmath248 , 10 rr lyrae deg@xmath248 and 12 blue horizontal branch stars deg@xmath248 in the centre of the sgr galaxy .",
    "this effect fully accounts for the difficulty of detecting clearly - defined sequences of evolved stars in small fields ( smaller than 1 deg@xmath5 ) even within the main body of cma , as well as for the low yield in searches of rare stellar species ( as rr lyrae stars in a system dominated by an intermediate - age and metal rich population , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the apparent size of cma and the number density of its stellar populations are fully compatible with those of a dwarf galaxy similar to sgr and located at @xmath276 kpc from us .",
    "the possible association of some old open clusters with cma was already suggested in pap - i ( see also pap - ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a thorough analysis of these clusters is clearly beyond the scope of the present contribution .",
    "however , the use of the red clump as a tracer may provide the unique opportunity of placing a few clusters onto the same distance scale as the field population of cma . in table  1",
    "we list a number of open clusters selected to be older than @xmath277 gyr and to lie in the surroundings of the main body of cma ( according to the webda database , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular the first group presented in tab .  1",
    "is composed of three clusters that directly project onto the main body of cma ( as seen in fig .  8 and 10 , for instance ) , and for which it has been possible to estimate the k magnitude of the red clump from 2mass photometry",
    ". hence the distance estimates for to  2 , am  2 and haf  11 have been derived in exactly the same way and under the same assumptions ( luminosity of the standard candle and reddening ) used for the analysis of the field population performed above .",
    "these estimates strongly indicate that to  2 , am  2 and haf  11 are physically located within the main body of cma ( see pap - ii for further discussion and references ) . note that , while am  2 and haf  11 lack any radial velocity estimate , to  2 has @xmath278 km / s , fully consistent with the systemic velocity of cma ( pap iii , pap iv ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , the present study fully ( and independently ) confirms the results presented in previous papers of this series and in @xcite : canis major has the size , the luminosity and the kinematics typical of a large dwarf galaxy , seen during the last stages of its disruption within the tidal field of the milky way ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "while a galactic origin for cma can not be definitely ruled out with the present data , the dwarf galaxy hypothesis appears as best suited to fit the overall observational scenario .    while further details emerge",
    " as , for example , the distance - longitude gradient  we begin to obtain a clearer view of this challenging system .",
    "future studies should try to overcome the several observational challenges posed by this nearby , low latitude object , to unveil the details of its stellar content ( age , chemical composition ) and to clarify its possible connection with the monoceros ring .",

    "to study the effect of the contamination by dwarfs in our color - selected sample of candidate rc stars on subtracted density maps , we recur to the galactic model by @xcite .",
    "this model includes the effect of the galactic warp and of the disc flaring , and takes into account the off - plane position of the sun .",
    "the main advantages of using the r03 model for our purpose can be summarized as follows :    * we can obtain ( k , j - k ) cmds of the synthetic samples , therefore we can apply exactly the same selections and analysis adopted for the observed sample ; * synthetic stars from the r03 models are individually classified into different species with the flag @xmath279 , hence the discrimination of dwarfs from giants is straightforward . in particular stars having @xmath280 are giants , those with @xmath281 are subgiants and those with @xmath282 are dwarfs . since the synthetic cmds reveal that both @xmath281 and @xmath282 stars can fall into our selection color - window , from now on we will consider all the stars of class 4 or 5 as _ dwarfs_.    the obvious disadvantage is that the result will not reflect the _ real _ galaxy but just a model of it .",
    "however , in the present context , the unavoidable approximations inherent to a galactic model should not represent a major concern . in the following",
    "we will mainly focus on the magnitude range @xmath283 , that is the range enclosing essentially all the stars that contribute to the main structures we discuss in the present paper , and cma in particular .    to allow the possibility of a direct comparison with observed cmds ( a very useful sanity check ) and to limit the dimensions of the synthetic catalogues we choose to work on @xmath284 deg@xmath5 windows in the latitude range @xmath285 , i.e. exactly the same as the observed sample whose cmd is shown in fig .  1 . to study the dwarf contamination toward different directions of interest",
    ", we selected three windows at @xmath286 , @xmath287 ( i.e. , the same as fig .  1 ) , and @xmath288 .",
    "we extracted from the model the corresponding samples in the southern and northern galactic hemispheres , at the above longitudes , for a total of six catalogues .",
    "the extraction was performed using the _ large field _",
    "option , that takes into account the variations of the population across the considered fields . to reproduce as well as possible the real case",
    "we let the model include the effects of interstellar extinction according to the default assumptions included in the web form .",
    "to simulate realistically the effect of photometric errors on synthetic stars we computed @xmath291 and @xmath292 for each of them with the above equations , we randomly extracted a gaussian deviate ( @xmath293 , positive or negative , in @xmath80 units ) for each of them , and then we added the resulting synthetic errors @xmath294 and @xmath295 to their k and j magnitudes , respectively .",
    "after that , we corrected the synthetic stars for extinction , using the @xmath296 value associated by the model to each star . in the following j and k",
    "stand for extinction - corrected magnitudes , as in the rest of the paper .",
    "the above procedure should provide synthetic samples as similar as possible to the observed ones , including the effect of photometric errors .",
    "the comparison of the final synthetic cmds for the @xmath297 window ( southern and northern hemisphere ) shown in fig .",
    "a1 with the observed cmd of fig .",
    "1 demonstrates that this objective has been achieved : the overall similarity between observed and synthetic cmds is striking . in fig .",
    "a1 we report also the adopted color window we use to select rc stars in the observed sample .",
    "a shift of @xmath298 mag in j - k has been applied to all the synthetic samples to center the vertical plume of rc stars within the selection window , as it is in the observed case .",
    "this small mismatch in color is likely due to a non - perfect match between the theoretical star tracks used by the r03 model and real stars ( quite a usual occurrence ) as well as to tiny differences in the adopted extinction laws . in any case",
    "the following results are essentially unaffected by the small color shift applied . in the following",
    "we will consider only syntethic stars falling in our color - selection window .",
    "hence , when we speak of _ dwarfs _ we mean stars of class 4 or 5 ( r03 ) having @xmath299 , and for _ giants _ we mean stars of class 3 having @xmath299 , that is , the stars that we would have selected as rc stars in our analysis .    before proceeding with our set of tests , fig .",
    "a1 deserves a few comments .",
    "it is quite clear that there is a strong asymmetry between the southern and northern samples : the southern sample contains many more stars and the difference is particularly evident in the rc plume .",
    "this is the effect of the warp included in the model .",
    "however the comparison of the lfs of the observed ( fig .  1 , left panel ) and of the synthetic ( fig .",
    "a1 , left panel ) southern samples shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "1 demonstrates that ( a ) the r03 model provides an excellent overall representation of the observed distribution of stars in the considered color window ( except for the total normalization , which appears too large by a factor @xmath190 ) , and ( b ) it still fails to reproduce the strong bump in the observed lf around @xmath300 , i.e. the putative rc of cma .",
    "this comparison is fully consistent with the coesistence of the galactic warp _ and _ an additional stellar system , cma . finally , the excellent agreement between the syntetic and observed lfs outside the @xmath301 range , seems to confirm that our samples are essentially complete down to @xmath302 , as stated in @xcite .      in fig .",
    "a2 the fraction of dwarfs falling into our color - selection as a function of k magnitude ( @xmath303 ) is shown for the northern ( open squares ) and southern ( crosses ) samples for the three selected directions .",
    "there are several interesting conclusions that can be drawn from this plot :    * first of all , since the line of nodes of the warp included in the r03 model lies exactly toward the @xmath87 direction , any south - north difference in @xmath303 and/or in the detected south - north asymmetries in the @xmath87 sample must be due to the effect of the @xmath304 pc displacement of the sun to the north of the galactic plane .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "a2 shows that difference in @xmath303 is very small , less than 5 per cent in any bin for @xmath46 and @xmath305 1 per cent in the whole @xmath306 range .",
    "moreover , the south - north difference in giants at @xmath87 is 5 per cent of that at @xmath297 and 2 per cent of that at @xmath255 .",
    "finally the south - north difference in the _ total _ number of color selected rc stars at @xmath87 is 12 per cent of that at @xmath297 and 6 per cent of that at @xmath255 .",
    "the conclusion is that the off - plane position of the sun has very little effect both on the contamination by dwarfs and on the amplitude of observed south - north asymmetries , for the applications considered here .",
    "hence our decision to neglect it in the analysis described in this paper appears to be fully justified .",
    "* in the range most relevant for the present study ( @xmath307 ) @xmath303 is quite large , reaching the 80 per cent level at @xmath86 , in some cases . *",
    "the overall degree of contamination is quite similar independent of the considered directions , from the anticenter to @xmath255 .",
    "* there are significant differences in the northern and southern @xmath303 toward @xmath297 and @xmath255 , up to @xmath308 per cent in some bins .",
    "however @xmath303 is _ always higher in the northern hemisphere than in the southern one_. it appears that , according to the r03 model , n - s differences in the contamination by dwarfs are working _ against _ the detection of real overdensities in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the latter result may appear puzzling at a first glance , but it can be easily explained by looking into the synthetic samples .",
    "it turns out that it is due to the presence of a significant south - north asymmetry at large galactocentric distances ( i.e. the warp ) that is much larger in giants than in dwarfs , in the magnitude ranges of interest .",
    "for example , in the range @xmath306 , at @xmath297 the south - north ratio of dwarf density is @xmath309 while for giants @xmath310 .",
    "therefore , even if there are more dwarfs in the south than in the north , the imbalance in giants is much larger and the final @xmath303 is consequently larger in the north ( @xmath31176 per cent ) than in the south ( @xmath31150 per cent ) . at @xmath255 , @xmath312 , while @xmath313 , in the same range of magnitudes .",
    "this implies that in presence of a distant south - north asymmetry ( as the warp , as in the r03 model we are presently considering , or cma , or both ) , the observed imbalance in dwarfs is small in this magnitude range , such that the contribution by dwarfs essentially disappears when southern and northern counts are subtracted .      1 .",
    "what is the contribution of dwarf contamination to _ subtracted densities _ ? 2",
    "is our observable , the subtracted density of color selected rc stars @xmath314 , a good tracer of the real overdensity of giants ?",
    "in other words , is it a good estimator of the quantity we are interested in ( @xmath315 ) ?          as a function of magnitude , for the three considered directions .",
    "the subscript t stands for total@xmath317dwarfs@xmath318giants .",
    "the ratio of the total southern - to - northern density is also reported within each panel .",
    "this plot shows that in absence of a real south - north asymmetry ( @xmath87 , @xmath319 ) the contribution is quite significant ( @xmath320 40per cent ) for @xmath321 . on the other hand , toward directions that cross the warp asymmetry ( @xmath322 , @xmath323 ) the dwarf contribution remains lower than 30 per cent everywhere , for @xmath49 .",
    "hence , even in a regime of _ strong _ contamination by dwarfs , the effects on south - north subtraction are quite limited for @xmath49 and in the presence of an overdensity like the warp and/or cma . on the other hand ,",
    "our subtracted maps may be significantly affected ( or even dominated , in some cases ) by dwarf contamination around @xmath87 and for @xmath47 .",
    "it is very interesting to note that in those regions we see a low - significance and smooth south - north residual ( fig .",
    "3 ) that completely disappears when we subtract by the rescaled northern density map ( fig .  5 ) . on the other hand",
    "all the structured overdensities we deal with in this paper lie in the region where dwarfs provide a minor contribution to the subtracted densities ( @xmath324 and @xmath49 ) . within this context",
    ", there is another interesting point worth considering .",
    "since the contribution of dwarfs to our subtracted densities grows continuously with magnitude even for @xmath48 , if our maps were seriously affected by dwarf contamination we would expect to see a corresponding growth of density with heliocentric distance . on the contrary , in the direction of cma we see",
    "_ both a growth and a decrease of the density _",
    "( see figs .  3 and 5 ) .",
    "the distance profile of fig .",
    "11 shows that toward @xmath129 the subtracted density reaches a maximum at @xmath93 kpc , corresponding to @xmath325 , and then essentially falls to zero at @xmath326 kpc , corresponding to @xmath327 , a completely different profile with respect to what is expected from a distribution of galactic dwarf stars .",
    "this occurrence strongly suggests that dwarfs can not have a major role in determining the observed distribution of the cma overdensity .",
    "the same argument is valid also when considering the trend of contamination of subtracted densities as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "since the degree of contamination grows toward @xmath87 , if dwarfs were dominant contributors to the subtracted density we should see the maximum density toward @xmath87 .",
    "on the contrary , the density in that direction is low and smooth , while it is much higher and more strongly peaked toward @xmath129 .",
    "a4 tries to answer question ( ii ) , above .",
    "this is simply a plot of the s - n density difference in the total number of stars selected in color as rc candidates with our technique ( i.e. , our observable @xmath328 ) , versus the actual difference in the s - n density of giants ( i.e. the quantity we want to estimate , @xmath329 ) , in the range @xmath306 , for the three directions we are considering .",
    "the correlation between @xmath328 and @xmath330 is _ very strong and essentially linear_. moreover the cofficient of the linear best - fit model is near unity , hence _ our observable appears as an excellent estimator of the true south - north density difference in giants _ , at least in the presence of an asymmetry like the warp embedded in the r03 model .      *",
    "the neglection of the displacement of the sun with respect to the galactic plane has very little effect on our analysis , and can be safely ignored . * while our samples of color - selected rc stars may be heavily contaminated by dwarfs , the effects of the contamination are much lower on the subtracted - density maps . the contribution of dwarfs to the `` observed '' @xmath328 is lower than 30 per cent for @xmath48 toward @xmath94 and @xmath255 , and much lower than this for @xmath331 .",
    "note that these numbers take into account only known galactic components , the presence of an extra asymmetry in the considered range of distances ( i.e. cma , see fig .",
    "1 ) would further reduce the rle of dwarfs . * the observable we adopt ( @xmath328 ) appears to trace very well the true south - north imbalance of giants under the realistic conditions provided by the r03 model .    it is conceivable that the cma overdensity we observe using color - selected putative rc stars may be in fact produced by an unexpected asymmetry in dwarfs .",
    "however the dwarfs contributing to our counts in the range @xmath332 have heliocentric distances 0.0 kpc @xmath333 4.5 kpc .",
    "their distance distribution shows a _ strong _ peak at @xmath334 , the mean is @xmath335 kpc and the standard deviation is @xmath336 kpc , and 89 per cent have @xmath337 kpc .",
    "hence a strong and _ very compact _ clump of dwarfs would have to be present in the southern hemisphere , at @xmath338 kpc from the sun toward @xmath94 , a feature that is obviously _ not present _ in the r03 model .",
    "as far as we know there is no report in the literature of such a local overdensity .",
    "finally , it should be recalled that the position and size of the rc overdensity studied here matches very well those derived for cma with other tracers ( m giants and ms stars ) that are much less affected by contamination from spurious sources ."
