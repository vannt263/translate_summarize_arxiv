    "astronomical ultraviolet studies were not possible before the advent of rocket - borne instruments and satellites due to atmospheric absorption and rayleigh scattering . the first satellite capable of uv observations , oao-2 , was launched in 1968 , and was followed by a host of other satellites ( cox 2000 ) , including thor delta-1 ( td-1 ) , astronomy netherlands satellite ( ans ) , and iue , among others .",
    "the data obtained by these instruments are responsible for the vast majority of contributions to studies of interstellar dust , as dust grains preferentially extinguish short - wavelength light . by comparing heavily extinguished stars against their intrinsic fluxes ( the pair method ) ,",
    "we can better understand grain properties and composition .",
    "this is important for two reasons .",
    "first , solid knowledge of grain properties will allow us to build more realistic grain models and correct for the effects of dust in stellar and galactic photometry and spectra more accurately .",
    "second , dust grains are extremely sensitive to their environment , and can yield much information about local conditions and the physical and chemical processes which affect grains .",
    "the pair method , first used by bless & savage 1970 , has since been used by many others to make extinction curves and study the ism in the milky way ( e.g. , york et al .",

    "there are significant differences between dust grain properties in the galaxy and those found in the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc and lmc , respectively ) .",
    "the smc bar has very strong , linear fuv extinction , while the sightlines toward the lmc2 supershell and the average lmc curve have a weaker bump and stronger fuv extinction than the average galactic r@xmath0=3.1 curve .",
    "there are also significant differences in metallicities and the gas - to - dust ratios between the galaxy , lmc , and smc ( bohlin et al .",
    "1978 ; gordon et al .",
    "2003 ; luck & lambert 1992 ) .",
    "a major leap forward in understanding interstellar extinction occurred in 1989 , when ccm suggested a mean extinction relation that depended on one parameter , the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , r@xmath0 ( = a@xmath1/e(b - v ) ) . with only very few exceptions ,",
    "galactic extinction curves tend to follow this law within the uncertainties of the calculated r@xmath0 values and the extinction curves ( fitzpatrick 1999 ; clayton et al .",
    "the galactic diffuse ism is well described by a curve where r@xmath0 = 3.1 .",
    "r@xmath0 can also be thought of as a rough indicator of grain size , with low r@xmath0 sightlines having more small grains than high r@xmath0 sightlines .",
    "the ccm extinction relation generally does not apply outside the galaxy , although recent work has shown that there are sightlines toward the lmc which may follow ccm ( gordon et al .",
    "this law essentially replaced the galactic average extinction curve ( seaton 1979 ) with a family of r@xmath0-dependent extinction curves , with each curve representing a mean curve for sightlines of that particular value of r@xmath0 .",
    "this also showed that many of the so - called `` anomalous '' sightlines ( e.g. clayton & fitzpatrick 1987 ) were in fact normal .",
    "in addition to finding this relationship , ccm pointed out the usefulness of normalizing extinction curves to a@xmath1 , rather than e(b - v ) , as was usually done .",
    "compared to e(b - v ) , a@xmath1 is a more basic quantity , and it is a direct measure of optical depth along a line of sight .",
    "galactic extinction curves can be fit with six parameters ( fitzpatrick & massa 1990 ) which allow for quantitative analysis of extinction characteristics .    despite all the work with extinction curves that has been done ,",
    "a homogeneous database of milky way extinction curves does not exist .",
    "the many previous studies , listed above , used data from different instruments , and variations of the pair method to construct extinction curves .",
    "so , the results of these studies can not be compared easily .",
    "also , these sightlines make up only about half of reddened sightlines available in the iue archive . to illustrate the disparateness of previous works , table [ tab : previous_work ] compares various aspects of previous studies to the present work .",
    "column ( 1 ) lists authorship , ( 2 ) lists the number of sightlines , ( 3 ) lists the instrument the data was from , ( 4 ) shows if fm parameters were found , ( 5 ) shows whether the extinction curves were constructed using the mk classification or uv stellar features , and ( 6 ) shows if ir photometry , specifically r@xmath0 , was considered for the entire sample .",
    "in order to solve this problem , we have built a homogeneous database of over four hundred extinction curves constructed in a uniform manner . over 150 of these sightlines",
    "extend beyond 2 kpc , and 30 extend beyond 5 kpc , thus sampling a much larger volume of the galaxy than ever before .",
    "this is a much larger and more complete database than any done previously . until the recent release of the 2mass database , jhk photometry was available for only a small fraction of the stars in the sample",
    "now , estimates of r@xmath0 are available for the entire sample .",
    "thus , it is now possible to draw a more coherent picture of extinction in the galaxy . in the following sections , we describe our database of extinction properties ,",
    "present the results of our analyses , and discuss the implications for dust grains .",
    "for the sake of homogeneity , hiltner s ubv photometry ( hiltner 1956 ; hiltner & johnson 1956 ) was preferred , when possible , and was obtained for 192 sightlines . in his massive compilation and assessment , nicolet ( 1978 ) found that hiltner s photometry was consistently of high quality .",
    "systematic errors were typically less than 0.01 mag ( hiltner 1956 ) and photometry agreed well with the works of others ( nicolet 1978 ) .",

    "the standard pair method , in which a reddened star is compared with an unreddened one of the same spectral type , was used to construct each sightline s extinction curve ( massa et al .",
    "the comparison stars were selected from cardelli , sembach , & mathis ( 1992 ) and dereddened .",
    "the spectral matches were made on the basis of comparing the uv spectra of pairs of stars rather than matching their visible spectral types .",

    "this relation shows how tightly constrained the linear component of the extinction is with respect to @xmath27 ( fm88 ) .",
    "there is also a weak correlation between c@xmath13/r@xmath0 and c@xmath14/r@xmath0 .",

    "one drawback to this model was that it required an overabundance of small grains in dense regions relative to diffuse regions ( fm86 ; sorrell 1990 ) , since a large value of @xmath17 implies small grain size in this scenario .",
    "this conflicts with the observation that dense regions tend to have higher values of r@xmath0 , indicating the prevalence of large grains . however , since x@xmath16 is not dependent on r@xmath0 ( or anything else ) , the grains which produce the bump may form a separate population from those which are responsible for variations in r@xmath0 ( ccm ) . on the other hand , it can be seen in fig . [",

    "he suggested that hydrogenation of grains in dense regions broadens the bump , without affecting x@xmath16 .",
    "mathis ( 1994 ) considered diamond , amorphous carbon ( amc ) , water ice , and pah mantles on graphite cores .",
    "he found that the diamond coating tended to shift x@xmath16 to longer much wavelengths .",
    "a thin coating of amorphous carbon yields x@xmath16 = 4.57 @xmath29m@xmath8 but produces a low @xmath17= 0.84 @xmath29m@xmath8 . increasing the thickness of mantle",

    "hydrogenated amorphous carbon mantles are even less suitable , as they shift x@xmath16 to longer wavelengths while having even less of an impact on @xmath17 than amc did .",
    "water ice mantles may broaden @xmath17 , but only one sightline in our sample ( hd 29647 ) has the telltale 3.07 @xmath29 m ice feature ( goebel 1983 ) .",
    "warren ( 1984 ) showed that ice mantles do not affect the bump because there is almost no absorption at wavelengths near 2175  .",
    "neutral pahs are also possible bump grain candidates , as they can produce both x@xmath16 and @xmath17 consistent with observations , with x@xmath47 4.61 @xmath29m@xmath8   for @xmath17= 1.0 @xmath29m@xmath8  ( mathis 1994 ) .",
    "however , these values were found by assuming that the optical constants of isolated pahs are similar to those comprising the mantle and by ignoring impurities which might alter the pah optical properties .",
    "another drawback is that neutral pahs should have absorption features in the uv which are not seen ( clayton et al .",
    "2003 ) , though joblin et al .",

    "adherence to the r@xmath0-dependent extinction law of ccm in our sample was also examined . in order to do this , we found the ccm curve which best fit each extinction curve .",
    "the extinction curves were fit with a ccm curve using a standard idl curve fitting routine that minimized the @xmath25 .",
    "the values of r@xmath0 found this way were compared to those calculated using ir photometry as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rv_test ] .",
    "while there is some scatter , there is generally good agreement between the two values , with the fitted r@xmath0 being within 3@xmath35 of the calculated value for 93% of the sample .",
    "this indicates that the vast majority of sightlines agree with ccm within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the near absence of non - ccm sightlines in the galaxy could be attributed to the iue dataset somehow favoring lines of sight through ccm - type dust environments .",
    "iue was a small telescope with limited dynamic range .",
    "as a result , there is little information on grain parameters deep inside dark clouds .",
    "the dust columns sampled in this study all have a@xmath48 5 mag .",
    "next we measured deviations of each measured extinction curve from its best fit ccm curve .",
    "we followed the method of mathis & cardelli ( 1992 ; hereafter mc92 ) , in which the authors specified the deviation at various wavelengths to be :    @xmath49_{i } - [ a_{\\lambda}/a_{v}]_{ccm}\\ ] ]    plots are shown of these deviations in fig . [ fig : deviations ] at 4.65 , 4.90 , 5.07 , 5.24 , and 7.82 @xmath29m@xmath8 .",
    "the calculated and best - fit ccm extinction curves agreed within 2@xmath35 of each other for all but four of the sightlines , hd 210121 , hd 204827 , hd 62542 , and hd 29647 , which are deviant at several wavelengths .",
    "their deviations are shown in table [ tab : deviations_list ] .",
    "hd 204827 is an intriguing sightline .",
    "it has been shown that when a foreground reddening component has been removed , its extinction curve resembles that of the smc , even though the environment of the dust in the hd 204827 cloud is quite different from that seen in the smc sightlines ( valencic et al .",
    "a similar curve has been found toward hd 283809 ( whittet et al .",

    "the hd 204827 dust cloud resembles a molecular cloud more than the diffuse ism .",
    "the hd 204827 cloud is very rich in carbon molecules , showing large column densities of c@xmath50 , c@xmath37 , ch , and cn ( oka et al .",
    "2003 ; thorburn et al .",
    "the sightline to hd 204827 samples dust swept up by a supernova or hot star winds ( patel 1998 ) . in these respects ,",
    "the hd 204827 dust is quite similar to the sightline toward hd 62542 ( cardelli & savage 1988 ) .",
    "its dust is also rich in carbon molecules .",
    "the sightline to hd 62542 also lies on the edge of material swept up by a stellar wind bubble .",
    "the other two non - ccm , weak bump , steep far - uv sightlines in the galaxy , hd 29647 , and hd 210121 , are also associated with dense clouds ( cardelli & savage 1988 ; larson , whittet , & hough 1996 ; cardelli & wallerstein 1989 ) .",
    "the dust in the molecular cloud associated with hd 210121 is likely to have been processed as it was propelled into the halo during a galactic fountain or other event .",
    "the final sightline , toward hd 29647 , is sampling dust in a quiescent dense cloud .",
    "the steep far - uv extinction in these clouds helps shield the molecules in these clouds from dissociating uv radiation leading to larger column densities ( mathis 1990 ) .",
    "[ fig : delta782_ncn_sig2 ] shows the deviations , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , plotted against the column density of cn along the sightline divided by a@xmath0 for 46 sightlines from our sample , including the four non - ccm sightlines discussed above ( federman 1994 ; oka et al .",
    "cn can be used as an indicator of relatively dense regions in diffuse , molecule - rich clouds ( joseph et al .",

    "the average @xmath51 and n(cn)/a@xmath1 ( 10@xmath53@xmath54 mag@xmath8 ) for the 42 ccm - like sightlines were 0.03@xmath260.03 and 0.33@xmath260.01 , respectively . for the four non - ccm sightlines , these values were 1.06@xmath260.15 and 2.75@xmath260.15 .",
    "these four sightlines have both high n(cn)/a@xmath1 and sigificant deviation from ccm at @xmath27=7.82 compared to the ccm - like sample .",
    "similarly , burgh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that sightlines with steep fuv rises tend to have high n(co)/e(b - v ) , though they did not notice any correlating weakness in the bump strength .",
    "virtually all of the non - ccm sightlines known today are in the ( diffuse ) magellanic clouds , not in dense galactic clouds ( e.g. , gordon et al .",
    "clayton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , found that the average of seven low density , low reddening sightlines showed an extinction curve very similar to the lmc .",
    "these 7 stars were found to be behind gas that showed signs of being subjected to shocks the deviations from ccm for the average of these 7 sightlines as well as for the smc and lmc average curves were also found and are included in figs .",
    "[ fig : deviations ] and [ fig : rv_test ] .",
    "similar deviations from ccm may arise in various dust environments .",
    "the new extinction curves and values of r@xmath1 allow us to revise the ccm law .",
    "this was done by following the method described in ccm ; that is , by plotting a@xmath55/a@xmath1 against r@xmath38 for all wavelengths , then performing a linear least - squares fit of the resulting correlation .",
    "thus , for all wavelengths , the extinction a@xmath55/a@xmath56r@xmath0 . then , @xmath57 and @xmath58 were plotted against @xmath27 and fit with a polynomial expression by minimizing @xmath25 .",
    "it was found that for 3.3 @xmath59m@xmath8 ,    @xmath60    where , for @xmath61m@xmath8 ,    @xmath62    and for @xmath63m@xmath8 ,    @xmath64    a comparison of extinction laws are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lots_of_lines ] .",
    "the most noticeable difference between the law found here and the original ccm law , the increase in the zero - point of the uv extinction , is a consequence of the slightly higher value of the first term in @xmath57 . in 1988",
    ", ccm also found a higher value for this term ( 1.802 ) than in 1989 ( 1.752 ) , when they found that the lower value , which was within the dispersion in the data , was needed for the curve to smoothly join the optical extinction data .",
    "[ fig : lots_of_lines ] also shows the resulting curve when the average fm parameter values are used to construct extinction curves at different values of r@xmath1 , in a fashion similar to fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) .",
    "the two methods of curve construction yield curves that are within 5% of each other for 2.5 @xmath65 r@xmath66 5.0 over the entire wavelength range .",
    "for all values of r@xmath1 , the difference is primarily in the bump height , or the fm parameter c@xmath14 .",
    "this is most noticeable for 5.0 @xmath39 r@xmath67 6.0 ; here , the curves agree to within 7% , with the curve found through the average fm parameters having a weaker bump than predicted by the either the revised or original ccm law .",
    "this can also be seen to a certain extent in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccm_karl ] . a weakened bump at high r@xmath1 may be expected from whittet et al.s ( 2004 ) work , which suggests that the bump carrier may be destroyed in dark clouds .",
    "both the revised ccm curves and the average fm curves are within about 5% of the original ccm law for 2.5 @xmath65 r@xmath66 3.5 . however , for increasing values of r@xmath1 , the difference between the curves increases as well , reaching 20% at r@xmath68 . that the original ccm law agreed so well with the extinction curves examined here",
    "is an indicator of the sizes of the uncertainties on the data .",
    "changes in the value of the extinction zero - point is an important factor . if the first term in @xmath57 is decreased by 0.20 , the new ccm law and the original curve agree to within 15% for 2.5 @xmath65 r@xmath1 @xmath65 6.0 for @xmath69m@xmath8 , and within about 20% for @xmath70m@xmath8 .",
    "the dotted curve , constructed from fitzpatrick s ( 1999 ) suggested values of fm parameters with only c@xmath50 ( and through it , c@xmath71 ) dependent on r@xmath1 , illustrate further the dependences of some fm parameters on r@xmath0 .",
    "we have constructed a homogeneous database of uv extinction curves , all of which have been fit by the fm relation and for which values of r@xmath0 have been calculated .",
    "all extinction curves and fm parameters have been normalized to a@xmath1 , rather than e(b - v ) , so that relationships between parameters may be more easily seen .",
    "this is the largest and most comprehensive database of extinction curves yet constructed , sampling a wide variety of environments .",
    "it contains much longer sightlines than those included in previous studies ( 30 sightlines have d @xmath2 5 kpc ) , thus greatly increasing the volume of the galaxy sampled compared to previous works .",
    "over 150 sightlines have d @xmath2 2 kpc , so the regions of the galaxy beyond the solar neighborhood are well represented .",
    "the ccm extinction relation accurately describes the diffuse galactic ism in virtually all cases . out of 417 sightlines , only 4 deviated consistently from their ccm extinction curves by more than 3@xmath35 .",
    "this indicates that the physical processes which give rise to grain populations that have ccm - like extinction dominate the ism , and thus , the quantity r@xmath0 can accurately describe the uv extinction for most sightlines .",
    "this implies that the grain populations responsible for different components of the extinction curve are being processed efficiently and systematically along most sightlines .",
    "the new curves and r@xmath1 values allow for an updated ccm law to be made .",
    "the original and updated versions are within 5% of each other for 2.5 @xmath65 r@xmath72 over the full wavelength range covered , 3.3 @xmath65 x @xmath73m@xmath8 . at higher values of r@xmath1 ,",
    "the differences in the extinction zero - point reduce the agreement in the curves to about 20% .",
    "the bump width has a strong environmental dependence , with narrow bumps favoring diffuse sightlines , and broad bumps favoring dense sightlines .",
    "very broad bumps are rare , as only 21 out of 417 sightlines had @xmath74 1.1 .",
    "the central wavelength of the bump is invariant and may be regarded as a constant , with x@xmath16=4.59@xmath260.01 . unlike the other parts of the uv extinction curve",
    ", this parameter does not respond to different environments .",
    "the invariance of x@xmath16 , along with the observed variations in @xmath17 , put strong constraints on possible bump grain and mantle materials .",
    "while there is evidence for shock processing in three of the four non - ccm sightlines , the common denominator is that all four sightlines have dense , molecule - rich clouds .",
    "they also had weak bumps and strong fuv extinction for their measured r@xmath0 ccm curves , especially those which pass through cold , quiescent regions .",
    "the weakened bump may reflect processing which modifies or destroys the bump carrier in dark clouds ( whittet et al .",
    "this is seen in the bumpless dust toward hd 204827 and hd 283809 .",
    "other dense sightlines with strong fuv extinction , hd 204827 , hd 62542 , and hd 210121 , pass through dense clouds that may have been exposed to shocks or strong uv radiation that disrupt large grains , possibly resulting in a size distribution that is skewed toward small grains .",
