    "the experimental achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in trapped dilute alkali atoms @xcite , spin - polarized hydrogen @xcite and metastable helium @xcite has stimulated considerable theoretical research @xcite on this unique phenomenon .",

    "recall that the bec can not occur in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) uniform bose gases at finite temperature , because in that case thermal fluctuations can destabilize the condensate .",

    "to avoid this sort of unphysically large condensate fluctuations , a canonical ( or a microcanonical ) ensemble has to be used to investigate @xmath4 .",
    "because in the experiment the trapped atoms are cooled continuously from the surrounding , the system can be taken as being in contact with a heat bath but the total number of particles in the system is conserved .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use the canonical ensemble to investigate the statistical properties of the trapped bose gas .    within the canonical ( or microcanonical ) ensemble ,",
    "the particle number fluctuations have been studied in the case of three - dimensional ( 3d ) ideal bose gases confined in a box @xcite , and in the presence of a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the question of how interatomic interactions affect the particle number fluctuations has also been the object of several recent theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "although the phase fluctuations @xcite of a condensate have been studied for quasi-1d and quasi-2d bose gases , to best our knowledge up to now an analytical description of the probability distribution and the behavior of @xmath5 for trapped 1d and 2d bose gases have not been given directly from the microscopic statistics of the system .",
    "the purpose of the present work is an attempt to calculate @xmath5 of the trapped ideal bose gas in various dimensions , using the analytical description of the probability distribution obtained directly from the analysis of the canonical partition function of the system .",

    "we have calculated the thermodynamic properties of the trapped bose gas , such as condensate fraction and particle number fluctuations . through the calculations of the probability distribution function ,",
    "we have provided a simple method recovering the applicability of the saddle - point method for studying the particle number fluctuations .",
    "we have found that although the probability distribution of the harmonically trapped bose gas are gaussian functions , the behavior of the particle number fluctuations is quite different from each other for different dimensions . for a trapped 2d ideal bose gas , the fluctuations exhibit a very weak anomalous behavior , while there is a strong anomalous behavior for a trapped 1d ideal bose gas .",
    "these properties are clearly shown by the explicit formulas given by ( [ analytical ] ) , ( [ 2d - flu ] ) and ( [ 1d - flu ] ) for the particle number fluctuations in three , two and one dimensions , respectively .",
    "we expect that the recent realization of bec in lower dimensions@xcite makes it very promising to explore the particle number fluctuations of lower - dimensional condensates .",
    "our results also show that different confinements can significantly change the effect of the particle number fluctuations . comparing with the case confined in a harmonic trap , the bose gases confined in a box exhibit much stronger effect for the condensate fluctuations .",
    "it is obvious that the method developed here can be applied to other bose systems .",
    "based on our approach , one can also formulate an improved saddle - point method to calculate the change of the particle number fluctuations when using a microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it can be shown that this will result in a change for particle number fluctuations only with a numerical prefactor @xcite .",
