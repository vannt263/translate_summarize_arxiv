    "the top quark s existence is now well established @xcite and top searches have given way to top studies . in measuring the top quark s properties  in particular , its mass  radiated gluons can play an important role .",
    "this is due not only to the relatively high probability that @xmath1 events are accompanied by additional gluon jets , but also to the fact that gluons can be radiated in both the top production and decay processes .",
    "this can complicate top momentum reconstruction , leading to ambiguities in identifying the top quark s decay products , increased systematic uncertainties , or both .",
    "these effects in turn influence any measurement based on momentum reconstruction , and may also bias event selection based on identifying top events via invariant mass cuts .",
    "therefore it is necessary to understand the distributions of radiated gluons in top quark events .",
    "there have been a number of studies of gluon radiation in top quark production and decay at @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 colliders @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we examined additional gluons in the processes @xmath4 at the tevatron @xmath3 collider in the soft gluon approximation and in @xcite we performed the exact calculation .",
    "these studies included all effects of gluons radiated from the initial state partons , from the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks at the production stage , and from the @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( and @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) in the @xmath9 decay ; all effects of the width in the top propagator were also included .",
    "these studies did _ not _ include gluon radiation from hadronically decaying @xmath0 bosons , so that , strictly speaking , they are directly applicable only to dilepton events , in which both @xmath0 s decay leptonically .",
    "but in the most useful channel  ` lepton @xmath10 jets '  only one of the @xmath0 s decays leptonically , and the other decays to quarks .",
    "the presence of one charged lepton in this channel helps suppress backgrounds without sacrificing event rate , while jets from the hadronic @xmath0 decay allow for direct reconstruction of one of the top quarks decay products .",
    "these events can also be accompanied by extra gluons .",
    "in fact they are more likely to do so than dilepton events , because there are more colored particles available to radiate .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of ref .",
    "@xcite for radiation of soft gluons in top production and decay at the tevatron to include gluon radiation in hadronic @xmath0 decays , @xmath11 . in the next section we present analytic expressions for all contributions to the gluon radiation probability in the soft gluon approximation , with a discussion of properties of the @xmath0 decay piece . in section 3 , we apply the results of section 2 to @xmath1 production and decay at the tevatron and show the resulting gluon distributions .",
    "expectations for the lhc are briefly discussed .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "at leading order , @xmath1 production and decay is given by the subprocess(es ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 or @xmath14 for hadron colliders , and the particles momenta are indicated in parentheses .",
    "let us assume that the @xmath15 decays hadronically :",
    "@xmath16 if we are interested in the all jets case , then both @xmath0 s decay hadronically and we also have @xmath17    now consider emission of a gluon with momentum @xmath18 .",
    "it can come from any of the quarks or gluons in the above processes ( _ i.e. , _ any of the particles whose momenta are labeled ) .",
    "this includes initial state radiation , gluons emitted by the top ( or @xmath6 ) quark in either the production or decay process , quark s virtuality picks up poles corresponding , respectively , to emission in the two stages .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion . ] and gluons emitted by the daughter quarks of the @xmath5 and @xmath19 and the @xmath0 boson(s ) .",
    "because of the infra - red divergence associated with radiation of gluons , an extra jet in a @xmath1 event will usually be soft . in the limit of soft gluon emission ,",
    "several simplifications occur .",
    "first , the gluon momentum @xmath18 does not affect the kinematics , so that all of the leading - order kinematic relations still hold .",
    "second , the differential cross section factorizes into the lowest - order cross section multiplied by a gluon radiation probability ; following @xcite we can write @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the differential cross section for the lowest - order process ( _ i.e. _ , with no gluon radiation ) , @xmath22 is the energy of the soft gluon , and @xmath23 is the strong coupling .",
    "the function @xmath24 is the sum of antenna patterns of the radiation from the different sources listed above .",
    "it can be written generically as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the contribution from emission at the @xmath1 production stage ( including initial - state radiation ) , @xmath27 is the contribution from emission off the @xmath5 and @xmath19 and their decay products at the weak decay stage , and @xmath28 is the contribution from interferences between these emissions . because we are interested in hadronic @xmath0 decays , it is useful to further decompose @xmath27 explicitly into the contribution from radiation off the @xmath5 s and @xmath7 s , and that from radiation off the quarks from the @xmath0 decay(s ) : @xmath29 @xmath30 includes contributions from one or both @xmath0 decays as appropriate .",
    "the interference term @xmath28 contains contributions from the interference ( i ) between radiation in the @xmath5 decay and that in the @xmath6 decay and ( ii ) between radiation in @xmath1 production and radiation in either decay .",
    "( as discussed below , there is no contribution to the interference from the @xmath0 decays because the @xmath0 boson is a color singlet . ) in principle @xmath28 can have substantial effects for gluon energies comparable to the top decay width @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , the observable soft jets that are relevant to the @xmath3 collider experiments have energies much larger than @xmath31 , and so in practice the interference terms are numerically small .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath24 have been presented in @xcite for the @xmath32 and @xmath14 subprocesses , excluding hadronic @xmath0 decays .",

    "additional collinear singularities arise from the @xmath39 denominators when @xmath40 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 depend on the color structure of the hard scattering and can be different for the @xmath32 and @xmath14 processes ( @xmath42 ) :        ' '' ''    coefficient & @xmath43 & @xmath44 + @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + @xmath54 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + @xmath55 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + @xmath56 & @xmath46 & 2y + @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath58 + @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath60 +    note that the coefficients @xmath61@xmath62 are involved only in the decay contributions ( including decay ",

    "explicit expressions and a discussion can be found in @xcite .    the production , @xmath65 decay , and interference contributions to @xmath24 have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , to which the reader is referred for further discussion .",
    "we shall focus here on the @xmath0 decay contribution . consider a single hadronically decaying @xmath0 : @xmath66 .",
    "its most important feature , for our purposes , is that the @xmath0 boson is a color singlet .",
    "radiation from its decay products at @xmath67 does not , therefore , interfere with gluons from other sources in the process .",
    "its contribution to the radiation pattern simply adds incoherently to the total at this order .",
    "in fact this contribution is just the familiar quark - antiquark antenna pattern , whose properties are well known and are discussed , _",
    "e.g. , _ in ref .",
    "its color structure is the same as for the decay @xmath68 .",
    "here we remind the reader of a few of its properties . because the @xmath69 and @xmath70 from the @xmath0 decay are taken to be massless",
    ", their contribution to @xmath24 depends only on their orientation relative to each other and to the gluon .",
    "furthermore , the only other kinematical factor is an overall @xmath71 , which is common to all terms in @xmath24 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are , respectively , the angles between the gluon and the quark , the gluon and the antiquark , and the quark and the antiquark .",
    "figure   shows the distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ antenna ] ) as a function of gluon angle for several @xmath76 angles .",
    "we see the collinear singularities characteristic of radiation from massless particles .",
    "in fact most ( but not all ) of the radiation is concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the two quarks , which translates in practice to strong sensitivity to jet separation cuts .",
    "we also see the string effect  the enhancement of radiation in the region between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 compared to that outside them",
    ". this enhancement can be quite significant when the quarks are relatively close together in angle .",
    "as the angle increases , the enhancement decreases , but does not disappear altogether , and for quarks that are back - to - back ( fig .",
    "1(d ) ) we see the plateau characteristic of initial state radiation , where the radiating particles are also back - to - back .",
    "finally we note that the preceding discussion of the @xmath0 decay contribution to the gluon radiation is true _",
    "independent _ of the source of the @xmath0 , as a consequence of its being a color singlet object .",
    "in particular , although we are concerned here with hadronic top production at the fermilab tevatron collider , hadronic @xmath0 decays in top production at , for example , an @xmath2 collider , are taken into account in exactly the same way . at the order to which we are working",
    ", the @xmath0 decay antenna simply adds incoherently to the contribution from the remaining sources of gluon radiation in any process of interest .",
    "and other colored particles in the scattering process begins at @xmath77 with the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state .",
    "this has been studied in the context of @xmath78 production @xcite . in general , such interference",
    "is suppressed by factors of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a scale characteristic of the gluon energies , and is therefore numerically very small @xcite . ]",
    "the soft gluon radiation pattern described by eq .",
    "( [ softsigma ] ) can be combined with the lowest - order cross section to obtain the full gluon distribution in a particular experimental situation . in this section",
    "we present the resulting gluon distributions for @xmath1 production at the fermilab tevatron @xmath3 collider for the case where one @xmath0 decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically , _ i.e. , _ the ` lepton @xmath10 jets ' mode .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the contribution from the hadronic @xmath0 decay adds incoherently to the other contributions .",
    "the latter correspond to what we would have for the dilepton mode , _",
    "i.e. , _ to the results in ref .",
    "we note that results for the production and ` @xmath65 ' decay distributions presented below are virtually the same as in @xcite , where a more complete discussion of them can be found . our emphasis here",
    "will be on the new features resulting from the @xmath0 decay contribution .",
    "we consider the process @xmath82 , with gluons generated according to eq .",
    "( [ softsigma ] ) , with @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) , for @xmath3 center - of - mass energy 1.8 tev .",
    "we take @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 and we use mrs(a@xmath87 ) parton distributions @xcite .",
    "we work at the parton level , with kinematic cuts corresponding roughly to those in the experiments : central production of leptons and quarks , some minimum separation of jets from each other and from the lepton , and energy and transverse momentum cuts appropriate to detectability of jets but also consistent with the soft gluon approximation .",
    "the cuts are @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the pseudorapidity and @xmath90 . in eq .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) @xmath91 represents the gluon jet and @xmath92 and @xmath93 represent any other detected jet ( @xmath7 , @xmath94 , or either of the quarks from the @xmath0 decay ) or the charged lepton .",
    "the @xmath95 and @xmath96 cuts eliminate the collinear singularities associated with emission from massless particles .",
    "the resulting distributions in the gluon energy and transverse momentum are shown as solid histograms in fig .  .",
    "the contribution associated with top production is shown as a dotted line , that for @xmath97 as a dashed line , and that for @xmath30 as a dot - dashed line .",
    "( interference terms are included in the total but are too small to appear on the plots . ) from the figure we see two features of the @xmath0 decay contribution that will also appear in the rapidity distribution , _ viz .",
    ", _ that it is comparable in both size and shape to the remaining decay piece .",
    "recall that the latter comes from the decays of both the @xmath5 and the @xmath19 , whereas the former involves only the decay of a single top .    the gluon pseudorapidity distribution is shown in fig .",
    "; again the @xmath0 decay piece looks very similar to the ` @xmath65 ' piece . we conclude that hadronic @xmath0 decays contribute substantially to gluon radiation in the central rapidity region , more than doubling the amount of radiation associated with the top quark decays .    for purposes of distinguishing the production and decay contributions in the dilepton case",
    ", we also considered in @xcite the behavior of the gluon distribution as a function of angular distance @xmath98 of the gluon from the @xmath7 quark . in fig .",
    "( a ) we show the distribution in @xmath98 for very small angles ( @xmath99 ) . except for allowing @xmath100 ,",
    "we have retained the cuts specified in eq .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) .",
    "we see that in this region the distribution is dominated by the ` @xmath65 ' decay contribution ( dashed histogram ) and that as @xmath101 decreases , the distribution increases and then turns over , displaying the ` dead - cone ' behavior characteristic of radiation from massive particles @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the distribution in the angular distance @xmath102 between the gluon and one of the ( massless ) quarks from the hadronic @xmath0 decay , shown in fig .",
    "( b ) , should have a singularity when the quark and gluon are collinear .",
    "we see that when we reduce the minimum allowed @xmath102 to @xmath103 , the distribution shows no signs of turning over at small angles .",
    "the singularity is avoided only by the @xmath101 cut .    while it is true that fig .",
    "shows the difference between emissions from massless and massive particles , the effect occurs at angles much too small for the difference to be detected experimentally .",
    "a less academic view appears in fig .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) , where we look at the same distributions on a larger scale after reimposing the @xmath104 requirement .",
    "the distributions look remarkably similar , the only real difference being which contribution dominates at small angles : the ` @xmath65 ' contribution ( dashed histogram ) in fig .",
    "( a ) and the @xmath0 decay contribution ( dot - dashed histogram ) in fig .",
    "( b ) . this could be used in principle to distinguish between the two decay contributions if one knew , from secondary vertex detection , for example , which were the @xmath7 jets and which were those from the @xmath0 decays ( assuming the gluon jet to be the softest one ) .",
    "however the results are quite sensitive to both the @xmath101 cuts and to fragmentation , which is not included in our parton - level analysis .",
    "a perhaps more promising way to separate out the @xmath0 decay contribution is to note that it is associated with only _",
    "one _ of the top decays . if the top quarks are produced more or less back - to - back , then",
    "some of that separation can be expected to survive the decay process . in that case",
    "the charged lepton would tend not to be too close to the quarks from the other @xmath0 decay . and",
    "since gluons prefer to be near the quarks that radiated them , radiation from the hadronic @xmath0 decay should increase with angular distance from the charged lepton .",
    "the expected effect is quantified in fig .  , where we show the gluon distribution as a function of the azimuthal angle difference between the lepton and the gluon .",
    "we consider the azimuthal angles because the @xmath5 and @xmath19 are produced back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "in addition to the cuts of eq .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) , we require the angular separation of the @xmath7 and @xmath94 to be greater than @xmath105 , and that all detected particles ( lepton and all jets , including the soft gluon jet ) have @xmath106 .",
    "these additional cuts are designed to increase the likelihood that the event is more central and the @xmath5 decay products more widely separated from those of the @xmath19 .",
    "the pseudorapidity cut on the gluon has the added advantage that it eliminates a large portion of the contribution from production ( _ cf . _",
    "fig .  ) . in fig .",
    "we see the expected behavior .",
    "all of the distributions are suppressed below about @xmath107 because of the @xmath101 cut . beyond that , the production and ` @xmath65 ' decay contributions are relatively flat .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 decay contribution ( dot - dashed histogram ) starts out at about the same size as the other two and increases with increasing angle , reaching a maximum about 50% higher than the initial value .",
    "_ all _ of the increase in the total gluon distribution is due to the increase in the @xmath0 decay contribution .",
    "similar effects would be expected in the distribution in azimuthal angle difference between the gluon and one of the @xmath7 quarks , due to the typical angular separation of about @xmath108 between the @xmath7 and @xmath0 from a single top decay . however , using the lepton is more practical experimentally because there is only one lepton in each event , decays , which can presumably be eliminated with an isolation cut . ] and also because identifying it and measuring its momentum does not involve the complications associated with doing so for jets .      if both the @xmath15 and @xmath109 in a @xmath110 event decay hadronically , then there are six jets in the final state at leading order .",
    "the advantages of this mode are its large branching ratio and the fact that , in principle , both the @xmath5 and @xmath19 can be fully reconstructed from their decay jets . in practice , combinatorics and huge qcd backgrounds make this task more difficult .",
    "in addition , radiation of a gluon can give rise to an extra jet , further complicating matters .",
    "if the additional gluon is soft , its distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ softsigma ] ) with the coefficient @xmath111 in @xmath30 as given in the table .",
    "now , in addition to the @xmath15 decay contribution discussed above , we also have one from the hadronic decay of the @xmath109 .",
    "this new contribution is the same as that from the @xmath15 , and it adds incoherently . therefore radiation from the @xmath0 decays is effectively doubled when both @xmath0 s decay to quarks .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  , which shows the gluon rapidity distribution at the tevatron , where both @xmath0 s contribute to the @xmath0 decay piece ( shown as a dot - dashed histogram ) .",
    "the cuts are as in eq .",
    "( [ cuts ] ) .",
    "their effect here is slightly different from above , however , because now there is no charged lepton , and the lepton and neutrino ( to which no cuts were applied previously ) are replaced by two quarks .",
    "the jet cuts now apply to _ all _ of the particles in the final state .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the @xmath0 decay contribution in the all jets case is slightly less than twice that for lepton @xmath10 jets .",
    "the transverse momentum , energy , and @xmath101 distributions exhibit a similar doubling of the @xmath0 decay contribution , and are omitted for brevity .",
    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will produce large numbers of top quark pairs .",
    "gluon radiation in top production and decay at the lhc differs from that at the tevatron largely because of the difference in collision energies . at the higher - energy lhc , the top quarks are more energetic , and the cross section is dominated by the gluon - gluon initial state , in contrast to the quark - antiquark annihilation that dominates at the tevatron .",
    "the result @xcite is a much larger proportion of production - stage radiation at the lhc than the tevatron , with relatively little ( on the order of 1020% ) radiation occurring in the decays in the dilepton case .",
    "we expect the effects of radiation from hadronic @xmath0 decays to be similar to effects at the tevatron : radiation from a single hadronically decaying @xmath0 would be comparable to the total decay contributions from the @xmath65 and @xmath112 antennae",
    ". production - stage radiation would continue to dominate .",
    "we defer a detailed discussion to an exact treatment .",
    "we have presented results for soft gluon radiation in top quark production and decay at the fermilab tevatron for the cases relevant for direct reconstruction of the top quarks : the lepton @xmath10 jets and all jets decay modes .",
    "allowing for radiation at @xmath67 from hadronic @xmath0 decays is straightforward because the @xmath0 is a color singlet .",
    "the corresponding contribution simply adds incoherently to the total , with no interference with the remaining contributions . for this reason , soft radiation in @xmath0",
    "decays is also easily treated in top production in @xmath113 collisions by adding @xmath30 to the @xmath24 appropriate to the electron - positron initial state ( _ cf .",
    "( [ softsigma],[curlyf ] ) ) .",
    "we found that , at the tevatron , gluons radiated in hadronic @xmath0 decays contribute subtantially to the total amount of radiation in the central region . in particular ,",
    "gluon radiation from _ each _ hadronic @xmath0 decay is comparable both in size and distribution to the _ total _ @xmath65 and @xmath112 decay contributions . the @xmath0 and non-@xmath0 contributions are thus difficult to distinguish . but by considering the distribution in the azimuthal angle between the gluon and the charged lepton in the lepton @xmath10 jets mode we saw that some separation is possible .",
    "we also note that since the @xmath65 and @xmath112 decay contributions comprise the total decay contribution in the dilepton detection mode , the @xmath0 decay contribution could in principle be isolated by making a direct comparison of jet distributions in dilepton and lepton @xmath10 jets events .    in attempts to measure the top mass by reconstructing the momenta of its decay products , it is very important to take into account the presence of extra jets due to gluon radiation .",
    "as we have shown in the soft approximation , hadronic @xmath0 decays give rise to significant amounts of gluon radiation .",
    "an analysis of the impact of this radiation on top momentum reconstruction requires an exact treatment , which we plan in future work .",
