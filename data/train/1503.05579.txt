    "disordered bose gas in a weak random external potential ( dirty boson ) represents an interesting model for studying the relation between bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and superfluidity and has been the subject of many theoretical investigations in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the dirty boson problem , was first studied with superfluid helium in aerosol glasses ( vycor)@xcite . recently , several groups have loaded ultracold atoms into optical potentials and studied becs in the presence of disorder @xcite .    what happens to a homogeneous bec if a weak random external potential is switched on ?",
    "indeed , the presence of disordered potential may lead to decrease both bec and superfluidity .",
    "furthermore , one of the intriguing feature of disordered bose gas is the appearance of the so - called anderson localization @xcite in the non - interacting case .",
    "this phenomenon which can be understood as the effect of multiple reflections of a plane wave by random scatterers or random potential barriers , has recently attracted a great deal of interest @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the random potential can be created using different techniques , one of which is the static laser speckle , whereas potential felt by atoms is proportional to the speckle intensity with the sign of the detuning from the atomic transition @xcite .",
    "laser speckle , produced by passing expanded laser beam through diffusive plates , are special in that they have ( i ) exponential , i.e. strongly non - gaussian , intensity distribution and ( ii ) finite support of their power spectrum @xcite .",
    "recent progress in different experimental realizations of laser speckle disorder is reported in references @xcite .    in their recent work abdulaev et__al _",
    "_ @xcite , have shown that a gaussian approximation of the autocorrelation function of laser speckles , used in some recent papers , is inconsistent with the general background of laser speckle theory .",
    "they also pointed out that the concept of a quasi-3d speckle , which appears due to an extension of the autocorrelation function in the longitudinal direction of a transverse 2d speckle , is not applicable for the true 3d speckle , since it requires an additional space dimension . in this context",
    ", they derived an appropriate autocorrelation function for an isotropic 3d laser speckle potential which has the fourier transform given in eq.([corrs ] ) ( see below ) .",
    "recent progress in the physics of ultra - cold gases have led to the creation of becs with dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) and stimulated a tremendous boost in theoretical and experimental studies of weakly interacting bose gases @xcite .",
    "what is important in such systems is that the atoms interact via a ddi that is both long ranged and anisotropic . by virtue of this interaction ,",
    "these systems are expected to open fascinating prospects for the observation of novel quantum phases in ultracold atomic gases . on the other hand , dipolar becs confined in random media",
    "remain largely unexplored .",
    "one can quote for example , uniform dipolar bose gas with a gaussian disorder correlation function , a lorentzian , and a delta - correlated disorder have been explored recently by pelster et__al _ _ @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we study the impact of a weak disorder potential with 3d isotropic laser speckle autocorrelation function of ref.@xcite on the properties of a homogeneous dipolar bose gas at finite temperature . to this end",
    ", we use the bogoliubov theory ( beyond the mean field ) and we calculate in particular the condensed depletion and the anomalous fraction . this latter quantity which grows with increasing interactions and vanishes in noninteracting systems@xcite , is important to fully understand the interplay of disorder and interactions .",
    "we show , in addition , how the anisotropy of the ddi enhance quantum , thermal and disorder fluctuations as well as the superfluid fraction .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[model ] , we describe our model of the dipolar dilute bose gas in a general random potential . in sec.[zerot ] , we derive analytical expressions for the condensate fluctuations and some thermodynamic quantities for 3d isotropic laser speckle disorder potential at finite temperature .",
    "we show that the competition between both contact interaction - disorder and ddi - disorder leads to enhance the condensate depletion , the anomalous density , disorder fluctuation , ground state energy , equation of state and the sound velocity . in sec.[superfluid ] , the superfluid fraction is obtained and its characteristics are discussed .",
    "finally , our conclusions and outlook remain in sec.[conc ] .",
    "we consider the effects of an external random field on a dilute 3d dipolar bose gas with dipoles oriented perpendicularly to the plane .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote , respectevly the usual creation and annihilation field operators , the interaction potential @xmath3 , @xmath4 corresponds to the short - range part of the interaction and is parametrized by the scattering length as @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", the dipole - dipole component reads @xmath6 where the coupling constant @xmath7 is @xmath8 for particles having a permanent magnetic dipole moment @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the magnetic permeability in vacuum ) and @xmath11 for particles having a permanent electric dipole @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the permittivity of vacuum ) , @xmath14 is the particle mass , and @xmath15 is the angle between the relative position of the particles @xmath16 and the direction of the dipole . the characteristic dipole - dipole distance can be defined as @xmath17 . for most polar molecules @xmath18 ranges from 10 to @xmath19  .",
    "the disorder potential is described by vanishing ensemble averages @xmath20 and a finite correlation of the form @xmath21 .    passing to the fourier",
    "transform and working in the momentum space , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) takes the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a quantization volume , and the interaction potential in momentum space is given by @xcite @xmath24,\\ ] ]    assuming the weakly interacting regime where @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the healing length and @xmath27 is the total density , we may use the bogoliubov approach . applying the inhomogeneous bogoliubov transformations @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are operators of elementary excitations .",
    "the bogoliubov functions @xmath31 are expressed in a standard way : @xmath32 with @xmath33 is the energy of a free particle , and @xmath34 the bogoliubov excitations energy is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the zeroth order chemical potential .",
    "+ importantaly , the spectrum ( [ spec ] ) is independent of the random potential .",
    "this independence holds in fact only in zeroth order in perturbation theory ; conversely , higher order calculations render the spectrum dependent on the random potential due to the contribution of the anomalous terms ( see below ) . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the excitations are sound waves @xmath38 , where @xmath39 with @xmath40 is the sound velocity without ddi .",
    "due to the anisotropy of the dipolar interaction , the sound velocity acquires a dependence on the propagation direction , which is fixed by the angle @xmath15 between the propagation direction and the dipolar orientation .",
    "this angular dependence of the sound velocity has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "therefore , the diagonal form of the hamiltonian of the dirty dipolar bose gas ( [ ham1 ] ) can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , + @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the total number of particles . @xmath45,\\ ] ] is the ground - state energy correction due to qunatum fluctuations .",
    "@xmath46 gives the correction to the ground - state energy due to the external random potential .",
    "the noncondensed and the anomalous densities are defined as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . then invoking for the operators @xmath49 the transformation ( [ trans ] ) , setting @xmath50 and putting the rest of the expectation values equal to zero , where @xmath51^{-1}$ ] are occupation numbers for the excitations .",
    "as we work in the thermodynamic limit , the sum over @xmath52 can be replaced by the integral @xmath53 and using the fact that @xmath54 , we obtain : @xmath55+n_r,\\ ] ] and @xmath56 the contribution of the random potential comes through the last terms in eqs ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) .",
    "these terms are defined as @xmath57    expressions ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) must satisfy the equality @xmath58 equation ( [ heis ] ) clearly shows that @xmath59 is larger than @xmath60 at low temperature irrespective to the presence of an external random potential or not .",
    "so the omission of the anomalous density in this situation is principally unjustified approximation and wrong from the mathematical point of view @xcite .",
    "to proceed further in practical calculations , we must define the laser speckle potential : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is defined by the light far - field intensity as @xmath63 and @xmath64 . at the derivation of @xmath65",
    ", it was assumed that the incident laser wave does not induce an atomic electron interlevel transition , but merely deforms the atomic ground state .",
    "it is useful now to specify the relationship between the far - field intensity autocorrelation function @xmath66 , the laser speckle autocorrelation function @xmath67 and the disorder potential correlation function .",
    "one can write then : @xmath68 and @xmath69 . therefore ,",
    "using the fourier transform , we get @xmath70 characterize the correlation length of the disorder ( for further computational details , see ref @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , we see from the formula of @xmath71 that its value becomes zero for @xmath72 . hence , the momentum in ( [ corrs ] ) only varies in a finite interval from zero , in contrast to the case for a gaussian function@xcite . putting @xmath73 @xcite , where @xmath74 stands for the disorder strength .",
    "substituting now the function ( [ corrs ] ) in equation ( [ depdis ] ) and performing the integration over the momentum form 0 to @xmath75 , we get the expression for the condensate fluctuation due to the external random potential @xmath76 where @xmath77 is depicted in fig.[dis ] , and the function    @xmath78 .",

    "therefore , we should reproduce the huang and meng result @xcite for the condensate depletion in this limit . for @xmath83",
    ", we get from eq.([func ] ) that @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the disorder fluctuation ( [ depdis1 ] ) becomes identical to that obtained in 3d dipolar bec with delta correlated disorder @xcite @xmath86 where the contribution of the ddi is expressed by the functions @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "note that functions @xmath89 attain their maximal values for @xmath90 and become imaginary for @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , the function ( [ func ] ) decreases with increasing disorder correlation length while it rises for increasing @xmath92 and diverges in the limit @xmath91 .",
    "another important consequence is that when @xmath5 vanishes , @xmath93 becomes infinite .",
    "this means that the system would collapse if there were no repulsive interactions between particles .    upon calculating integral in eq.([nor ] ) , we get for the condensate depletion @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a dimensionless disorder strength .",
    "the integral in eq.([anom ] ) is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "this divergence is well - known to be unphysical , since it is caused by the usage of the contact interaction potential . a general way of treating such integrals is as follows .",
    "first , one restricts to asymptotically weak coupling and introduces the beliaev - type second order coupling constant @xcite @xmath96 after the subtraction of the ultraviolet divergent part , the anomalous fraction turns out to be given @xmath97 the leading term in eqs.([dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) represents the qunatum fluctuation@xcite . the subleading term which represents the thermal fluctuation@xcite ,",
    "is calculated at temperatures @xmath98 , where the main contribution to integrals ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) comes from the region of small momenta ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the situation is quite different at higher temperatures i.e. @xmath100 , where the main contribution to integrals ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) comes from the single particle excitations .",
    "hence , the thermal contribution of @xmath60 becomes identical to the density of noncondensed atoms in an ideal bose gas @xcite , while the thermal contribution of @xmath59 tends to zero since the gas is completely thermalized in this range of temperature @xcite .",
    "the last term in ( [ dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) accounts for the effect of disorder on the noncondensed and the anomalous densities",
    ".    equation ( [ anom1 ] ) clearly shows that at zero temperature , the anomalous density is larger than the noncondensed density for any range of the dipolar interaction as well as for any value of the strength and the correlation length of the disorder as it has been anticipated above .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 changes its sign with increasing temperature in agreement with uniform bose gas with a pure contact interaction @xcite .",
    "likewise , the anomalous density obtained in ( [ anom1 ] ) permits us to elaborate in a straightforward manner the equation of state and thus , leads to a finite compressibility ( see below ) . remarkably , eqs.([dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) reproduce the short range interaction results since @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , the ddi enhances quantum , thermal and disorder fluctuations of the condensate for increasing @xmath92 as is shown in fig.[dis ] .",
    "the bogoliubov approach assumes that fluctuations should be small .",
    "we thus conclude from eqs .",
    "( [ dep ] ) and ( [ anom1 ] ) that at @xmath102 , the validity of the bogoliubov theory requires inequalities @xmath103 and @xmath104 . for @xmath105 ,",
    "this parameter differs only by the factor @xmath106 from the universal small parameter of the theory , @xmath107 , in the absence of ddi . at @xmath108 ,",
    "the bogoliubov theory requires the condition @xmath109 .",
    "the appearance of the extra factor ( @xmath110 ) originates from the thermal fluctuations corrections .",
    "the presence of quantum and disorder fluctuations leads also to corrections of the chemical potential which are given by @xmath111=\\sum_{\\bf k } f({\\bf k } ) ( \\tilde{n}+\\tilde{m})$ ] @xcite . inserting the definitions ( [ nor ] ) and ( [ anom ] ) into the expression of @xmath112",
    ", we find after integration : @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "+ in the absence of disordered potential ( @xmath105 ) , eq.([chem ] ) coincides with that derived recently in @xcite . for a condensate with a pure contact interaction ( @xmath116 ) and for @xmath105 ,",
    "the obtained correction to the chemical potential ( [ chem ] ) excellently agrees with the seminal lee - huang - yang quantum corrected equation of state @xcite .",
    "+ the energy shift due to the interaction and the quantum fluctuations ( [ fenergy ] ) is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "the difficulty is overcome if one takes into account the second - order correction to the coupling constant ( [ cc ] ) . a simple calculation yields@xcite @xmath117 however , the energy shift due to the external random potential ( [ disp ] ) is evaluated as @xmath118 where @xmath119 . + when @xmath120 , the energy shift due to the external random potential ( [ renergy ] ) is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "again , by introducing the renormalized coupling constant ( [ cc ] ) one gets : @xmath121 which well concides with the result obtained with delta correlated disorder of ref @xcite .",
    "the superfluid fraction @xmath122 can be found from the normal fraction @xmath123 which is determined by the transverse current - current correlator @xmath124 .",
    "we apply a galilean boost with the total momentum of the moving system @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes the superfluid velocity and and @xmath127 is normal fluid velocity with @xmath128 being a boost velocity @xcite . the superfluid fraction is then written @xmath129 ^ 2 } \\\\",

    "third terms in ( [ supflui1 ] ) and ( [ supflui2 ] ) which represent the thermal contribution of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , are calculated at low temperatures @xmath142 . whereas , at @xmath143 , there is copious evidence that both thermal terms of @xmath144 concide with the noncondensed density of an ideal bose gas .",
    "furthermore , we read off from eqs.([supflui1 ] ) and ( [ supflui2 ] ) that for @xmath145 , the thermal contribution of @xmath140 is smaller than that of @xmath141 , while the situations is inverted for @xmath146 .    for @xmath83 and @xmath82 , both components of the superfluid fraction reduce to @xmath147 , which well recoves earlier results of refs @xcite for isotropic contact interaction . for @xmath83",
    ", we have @xmath148 and @xmath149 . as a result , the disorder correction to superfluid fraction ( [ depdis1 ] ) becomes identical to that obtained in 3d dipolar bec with delta correlated disorder @xcite .",
    "we should stress also that for increasing @xmath150 , @xmath151 decreases , whereas @xmath152 increases for fixed @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , this reveals that there exists a critical value of interaction @xmath153 beyond which the system has the surprising property that the disorder - induced depletion of the parallel superfluid density is smaller than the condensate depletion even at @xmath154 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the localized particles can not contribute to superfluidity and , hence , form obstacles for the superfluid flow . for large disorder correlation length",
    "i.e. @xmath155 , @xmath153 reduces indicating that the localized particles are localized in the respective minima for the disorder potential only for a finite localization time @xcite .",
    "this localization time remains to be analyzed in more detail in a future work .",
    "in addition , the superfluid fraction can be either larger or smaller than the condensate fraction @xmath156 , depending on temperature , on interaction and on the strength of disorder .",
    "increasing @xmath157 leads to the simultaneous disappearance of the superfluid and condensate fractions .",
    "note that the sound velocity of a dipolar bec in a weak external disorder potential can be calculated within the hydrodynamic approach as @xmath158 @xcite , where the tensorial property of the superfluid density has been taken into account . from eqs.([supflui1 ] ) and ( [ supflui2 ] ) it follows that the sound velocity can also be separated into a parallel and a perpendicular components .",
    "both components change via effects of the interaction strength @xmath92 , disorder strength @xmath157 and the ratio @xmath80 .",
    "one can easily show also that the sound veclocity is consitent with the inverse compressibility @xmath159@xcite , where the increase in @xmath160 tends to increase the sound velocity and vice versa .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the properties of a homogeneous dipolar bose gas in the presence of a weak disorder with autocorrelation function for an isotropic 3d laser speckle potential at finite temperature . using the bogoliubov approach ,",
    "we have calculated the condensate fluctuation due to disorder , as well as the corresponding corrections the condensed depletion , the anomalous fraction , the chemical potential , the ground state energy and the sound velocity .",
    "we have pointed out that the interplay between the anisotropy of ddi and the external random potential leads to modify both the bec and the superfluidity characteristics .",
    "furthermore , we have reproduced the expression of the condensate fluctuations and thermodymanics quantities obtained in the literature in the absence of both the ddi and the disordered potential .",
    "we discuss the validity criterion of the bogoliubov approach in a dirty dipolar bec .",
    "finally , an interesting question that begs to be asked is how the interplay of disorder and ddi can affect anderson localization , or the quantum phases that arise due to disorder in the regime of strong correlations .",

    "<S> we investigate the properties of a homogeneous dipolar bose gas in a weak three - dimensional ( 3d ) isotropic speckle disorder at finite temperature . by using the bogoliubov theory ( beyond the mean field ) </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the condensate and the superfluid fractions as a function of density and strengths of disorder and interaction . the influence of disorder on the anomalous density , the chemical potential and the ground state energy is also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the peculiar interplay of the ddi and weak disorder makes the superfluid fraction and sound velocity anisotropic . </S>"
