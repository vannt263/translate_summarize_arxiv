    "currently , dynamical systems analysis and design primarily uses the geometric picture , as put forth by poincar in his work on the three body problem .",
    "much of the framework is built around notions from differential geometry , trajectories and invariant manifolds .",
    "such an approach has met with success in a variety of settings and , at this point , one hardly needs to justify the use of geometric theory when working on a particular problem .",
    "however , the geometric viewpoint is ill - suited to many of the situations that are of interest in real systems .",
    "for example , for systems possessing hyperbolic regimes , the unstable manifolds give rise to locally exponentially divergent trajectories .",
    "any noise or uncertainty in the system will lead to multiple possible trajectories for an initial condition , with the width of the set trajectories initially expanding exponentially . in such cases , questions about the behavior of a specific trajectory are difficult to answer .",
    "systems with a large number of dimensions can be problematic as well , since many of the geometric arguments are only valid in a low number of dimensions , e.g. , bendixson s criterion for determining the non - existence of periodic orbits in the plane . in some cases , these arguments can be extended , with difficulty , to an arbitrary number of dimensions . even in these cases",
    ", however , a practical implementation limits them to a moderate number of dimensions . to handle high - dimensional systems , special symmetries or other conditions",
    "are required in order to effectively reduce the dimension to a manageable size .",
    "furthermore , without access to explicit odes , even basic geometric analysis is difficult to apply . if dynamical systems theory is to become an important field in the context of pressing problems such as `` big data '' , tools need to be developed that are capable of handling high - dimensional , uncertain , and ill - described systems , as well as systems for which past time - evolution data is available , but for which no simple mathematical description can be determined.@xcite    this article presents a viewpoint that is at the intersection of applied ergodic theory and operator theory .",
    "these two fields can be used in applied settings to analyze and design dynamical systems , with many of the aforementioned difficulties being handled with a certain amount of elegance .",
    "in fact , when we study dynamical systems through certain linear operators , the _ full nonlinear dynamics can be captured within a linear setting_. this linear setting allows the power of spectral analysis to be brought to bear on a ( nonlinear ) problem without sacrificing any information as required by other linearization techniques .",
    "contrast this with the traditional spectral approach that only determines geometry locally in the state space .",
    "additionally , in theory , the operator - theoretic approach works equally well whether the original state - space is low- or high - dimensional ; the same techniques apply to both cases .",
    "the framework is also well suited to studying noisy systems because the primary object of interest is no longer the trajectory .",
    "finally , and perhaps most significantly , the operators involved can be constructed , approximated , or analyzed using only simulation or experimental measurement data .",
    "this allows a certain black - box approach to the analysis which is quite useful in real problems where the practitioner may not have full knowledge of the system s internals .    as with any technique , however , there is a tradeoff in order to gain the above advantages .",
    "the operator - theoretic picture has no immediate connection to our physical intuition , making its meaning more difficult to comprehend .",
    "one s viewpoint must change from considering the evolution of points in the state space to considering the evolution of functions .",
    "additionally , the new approach is inherently infinite - dimensional , even when the state space is finite - dimensional .",
    "this sacrifice is what allows the full information of a nonlinear system to be contained within a linear setting .",
    "because of this , the implementation of any approximation is a more delicate issue .",
    "finally , the associated numerical techniques are underdeveloped .",
    "most of our approaches employ direct computations which are little more than numerical implementations of proofs .",
    "the two main candidates for the study of systems via operators are the koopman operator and the perron - frobenius operator . in appropriate function spaces",
    ", they are duals to each other , so theoretically , there should not be any distinction in working with one as opposed to the other .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , we must always include applied considerations .",
    "questions arise such as how do we construct or represent the chosen operator from the problem description and given data ? how well does a finite approximation represent the ideal theoretical picture ? what part of intuition gained is due to numerical artifacts and what is real ?    the perron - frobenius operator represents a `` dynamics of densities '' picture ; it looks at groups of trajectories .",
    "one can think of this as watching the evolution of a mass distribution under the action of a flow . from a numerical perspective ,",
    "construction of the operator relies on selecting a set of initial conditions and simulating forward for only a short time period , thus avoiding the compounding of numerical time - integration errors . due to these short bursts",
    ", transient dynamics can be captured very well .",
    "however , much attention has been focused on computing invariant densities,@xcite which are infinite - time objects , through approximating the perron - frobenius operator by a markov chain .",
    "the number of simulated initial conditions is dictated by the need to sample the region of interest well .",
    "in high - dimensions , both short- and long - time dynamics simulations require a mesh on the entire space .",
    "this can be true even in the case of a low - dimensional attractor .",
    "if we have _ a priori _ knowledge of the low - dimensional subspace the attractor lives in , then the mesh size can be restricted",
    ". however , for an arbitrary system , this knowledge may not be initially available , thus requiring the full mesh .",
    "on the other hand , the koopman operator presents a picture for the `` dynamics of observables '' .",
    "the difference in viewpoints between the perron - frobenius and koopman operators is similar to the eulerian versus the lagrangian viewpoint in fluid mechanics , with the koopman picture corresponding to the lagrangian viewpoint .",
    "what is meant is that measurements are made along trajectories .",
    "for the koopman operator , the numerical construction relies on potentially fewer initial conditions , but requires longer run - times , which is more suitable to physical experiments .",
    "for example , when testing a jet engine , it is started from a relatively small number of initial conditions and run it over a long time rather than preparing thousands of initial conditions and running the engine for a few seconds for each initial condition . due to",
    "the long run - times required , the asymptotics are well - understood . however , more research is needed to understand the transients .    to visualize high - dimensional dynamical systems ,",
    "we often restrict our attention to one , or a few , two - dimensional cross - sections in the state space and look at the invariant structures intersecting that slice . with the perron - frobenius operator ,",
    "it is difficult to directly compute invariant densities on the slice of interest , since , in principle , it requires a computation of the invariant density for the entire state space as an intermediate step . for the koopman operator",
    ", invariant objects are attached to initial conditions , making it well - suited to visualizing structures on an arbitrary 2d cross - section in the state space .",
    "initial conditions can be easily prepared on the slice and the invariants directly computed . in such cases ,",
    "the number of initial conditions required to understand the dynamics is significantly reduced .",
    "while operator methods , and specifically the koopman and perron - frobenius operators , have much potential to deal with applied problems , these methods are all but absent from the applied and industrial settings , with due exceptions.@xcite to speed up the adoption of operator techniques in these domains , any new methodology needs to be able to leverage already existing data , instead of proposing both a new methodology _ and _ a new way to collect data .",
    "the `` dynamics of observables '' perspective , and specifically the koopman operator , is used as it deals with measurements , i.e. , observables , which are well - understood both theoretically and computationally . on the other hand",
    ", the perron - frobenius techniques would require working with representations of densities , which are often singular , especially in well - behaved engineered systems .    in this paper",
    ", we intend to describe three concepts , all under the umbrella of `` dynamics of observables '' , that show how this theory can be made useful for analysis and design .",
    "contributions can be split between theoretical and applied contributions .",
    ". dynamical evolution of a system can be studied by looking at what is termed _ koopman mode analysis_. the concept is similar to normal mode analysis familiar from linear vibration theory .",
    "koopman mode analysis starts with a choice of a set of linearly independent observables , or equivalently a vector - valued observable .",
    "the koopman operator @xmath0 is then analyzed through its action on the subspace spanned by the chosen observables .",
    "the observables are decomposed into projections onto the eigenspaces of @xmath0 , and the evolution is a sum of terms composed of a product of three terms :    a part that is time - dependent and is determined by the eigenvalue ( or frequency ) associated with the eigenspace ;    an eigenfunction of @xmath0 , which is a function of the initial conditions ;    the vector of the coefficients of the projection of the observables onto the eigenspaces , with the coefficients only being functions of the chosen observables .    in this way , spectral analysis can be performed on nonlinear systems .",
    "this analysis is also used for model reduction.@xcite    \\2 .",
    "the notions of the _ ergodic quotients and eigenquotients _ allow the koopman operator to be used for the extraction and analysis of invariant and periodic structures in the state space.@xcite the points in the state space are grouped into invariant sets using level sets of eigenfunctions of the koopman operator . instead of set - theoretic framework",
    ", this approach is lifted to the analytical setting using the ergodic quotient and eigenquotient formalism .",
    "the eigenquotients are studied as subsets of particular sobolev spaces , where their geometry gives insight into the structure of the state space , in spirit similar to analysis of hamiltonian systems via morse theory of the associated energy functions .",
    "\\3 . in the standard interpretation of ergodic theory ,",
    "mixing and ergodicity are treated as binary concepts : a system is either mixing / ergodic or it is not . both mixing and ergodicity",
    "can be formulated using spectral invariants of the koopman operator . from a finite - time evolution of an arbitrary system",
    ", we can quantify how close its spectral invariants are to the `` ideal '' case , e.g. , mixing or ergodic , and in this way formulate _",
    "continuous indicators of ergodicity and mixing_. the ergodicity defect@xcite and the mixing norm@xcite are examples of continuous indicators that extend the corresponding binary notions .",
    "such a relaxation brings the concepts of ergodicity and mixing into an engineering context , allowing , e.g. , the use of the indicators as optimization criteria . we present a unified explanation of the concepts that have previously appeared in literature.@xcite      numerical computation of the objects in the theory uses elements from three different areas . fourier analysis based methods are useful for computing koopman modes for dynamics on the attractor in addition to being essential for the construction of the eigenquotient .",
    "a variant of the standard arnoldi algorithm based on companion matrices is also useful for computing part of the spectrum of the koopman operator , a basic element of koopman mode analysis .",
    "this variant does not require an explicit representation of the operator and only requires data , sequences of vectors coming from either simulations or experiments .",
    "koopman mode analysis has seen applications in fluids mechanics to extract spatial structures for the flow.@xcite koopman modes have also found applications in the analysis of coherency and instabilities for power systems@xcite and in the field of building energy efficiency where they have been used for model validation and data analysis.@xcite    to compute the eigenquotients numerically , a set of observables is averaged along trajectories started at different initial conditions , obtaining a finite - dimensional representation of any eigenquotient .",
    "such representations are analyzed with the aid of a diffusion maps algorithm , @xcite which computes a change of coordinates , _ the diffusion modes _",
    ", for the eigenquotient . in the limit where infinitely many initial conditions were simulated for infinite time , such coordinate change would render any consequent analysis independent of the choice of the observables averaged during the computation .",
    "the scale - ordering of diffusion coordinates makes it practical to obtain a low - dimensional approximation of the eigenquotients .",
    "the averaging along trajectories is used again to formulate continuous indicators for ergodicity and mixing , where the rate of approach of the averages along finite - time trajectories to the infinite limit is indicative of the underlying dynamics . based on such indicators , the dynamics of the flows can be designed to match a particular statistical behavior , with applications in path - planning for vehicles@xcite and mixing of fluids on micro - scales.@xcite",
    "we start off by fixing some notation and terminology .",
    "let us denote the state space by @xmath1 and define dynamics on it by the iterated map @xmath2 .",
    "note that the set @xmath1 can be an arbitrary set ( possessing no structure ) and @xmath3 can be an arbitrary map on this set .",
    "then the abstract dynamical system is specified by the couple @xmath4 .",
    "note that standard texts on ergodic theory study a specific case when @xmath1 is a measurable space , with a @xmath5-algebra @xmath6 , and @xmath3 is @xmath6-measurable .",
    "additionally , transformation @xmath3 is typically assumed to be measure - preserving , i.e. , there exists a measure @xmath7 , _ the invariant measure _ , such that for any @xmath8 @xmath9 with @xmath10 understood as the pre - image of @xmath11 .",
    "the measure @xmath7 does not necessarily have a density function associated with it .",
    "for the formulation of the theory in this paper , we do not require the measurable framework , although when answering more specific questions , we might restrict ourselves to it , as it is the one most commonly encountered in applied dynamical systems .    we will be concerned with the behavior of observables on the state space .",
    "to this end , we define an observable to be a function @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an element of some function space @xmath14 . for now , it is not necessary to specify any structure for @xmath14 .",
    "a concrete interpretation of an observable is that of a sensor probe for the dynamical system in question ; we can access information about the system via the evolution of the observable s values . instead of tracking the trajectory @xmath15",
    ", we now track the trace @xmath16 .",
    "the description of the dynamics can then be concisely written down in the form of state and output equations , familiar to control theorists : @xmath17 the dynamical systems community mainly focuses on state space trajectories @xmath18 , while the control systems community usually studies systems that have an additional input or disturbance terms , with the functions @xmath3 and @xmath13 taking particular forms that are common in engineered systems .",

    "more generally , we can consider vector valued observables , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is some vector space .",
    "for example , when analyzing the heat equation on a periodic box @xmath33 , the state space can be regarded as the sequence space of fourier coefficients and an observable @xmath34 can be regarded as mapping between a sequence of fourier coefficients ( the state space @xmath1 ) and a temperature distribution on @xmath33 ( the real - valued space @xmath35 ) .",
    "we will revisit this setup in more detail in example [ ex : heat ] .",
    "the above notion of the koopman operator was defined in the context of discrete - time dynamical systems .",
    "often though , working in the discrete - time setting poses an unneeded restriction ; in many systems , the natural formulation of the dynamics is with respect to a continuous time variable .",

    "the practical value of @xmath843 is in how its constituents are computed : @xmath844 is computed as a time - average of an indicator function , which is very easily computed as the system is being simulated from an ode . when @xmath7 is the volume measure , quantities @xmath845 $ ] are just volumes of euclidean balls , and are computed using well - known formulas .",

    "is not sacrificed .",
    "the resulting empirical ergodicity is given by a metric induced by the negative - index sobolev norm @xmath705 on the space of distributions @xmath700 ( cf .  ) , if both @xmath851 and @xmath852 are in it .",

    "can be used as the proxy for computing decay of @xmath843 to detect ergodicity , since @xmath858 is easier to numerically evaluate for most measures @xmath7 .",
    "a practical application of @xmath843 can be seen on a model search - and - rescue problem , where an unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ) , e.g. , a small helicopter , would search an area containing a target whose position is estimated by a probability density @xcite .",
    "the search path for the vehicle can be planned using a dynamical system : the searcher is treated as a passive particle , possibly with a non - zero inertia , in a fluid - like flow .",
    "the probability density is a product of gaussians , modeling a priori estimates of the target , and discontinuous indicator functions , modeling foliage on the ground where the uav has no visibility .",
    "the goal is to design the dynamics of the flow , such that the trajectory traced out by a particle avoids foliage and explores the feasible area according to probability of finding the target .",
    "the devised control algorithm used @xmath861 ( in continuous - time setting ) as the optimization function in a hamilton - jacobi - bellman framework . instead of optimizing for decay of @xmath861 over a finite horizon @xmath862 $ ]",
    ", a greedy approach is chosen , where the optimization horizon is shrunk to the instance by taking @xmath863 , resulting in a closed - form expression feedback law which relies on finite - time averages of harmonic observables , computed along the path that the searcher traveled . as a result ,",
    "trajectories designed for a team of uavs searched the area efficiently , with minimal crossings over the zones with high foliage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : smcsearch ] ) , with further details presented in @xcite .",
    ".29    .29    .39    in addition to quantifying ergodicity , the @xmath700 norm can be used to quantify mixing with respect to a target density @xmath851 , in which context it was originally developed.@xcite in the final design of a micro - mixer , an initial concentration of fluid reactants @xmath864 was advected by a dynamical system , whose effect was captured by the perron - frobenius operator @xmath865 . to quantify mixing ,",
    "the metric @xmath866 was computed with the order @xmath867 . by optimizing the dynamics of the fluid flow , a quick mixing of reactants",
    "was successfully achieved ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sob - mixing ] ) , both in numerical and experimental settings .",
    "the main difference between @xmath868 and @xmath843 is that the mixing metric compares _ instantaneous _ advected density @xmath865 to the prior @xmath7 , which , in the dual koopman framework , is equivalent to using @xmath869 .",
    "recall that the ergodicity metric used the temporal averages @xmath870 $ ] ( cf . ) .",
    "the other difference between mixing and ergodicity indicators can be interpreted as the requirement on the scales at which measure @xmath7 is sampled : the ergodicity indicator @xmath843 gives more weight to larger spherical sets , while in @xmath868 , differences over all sets are weighted the same , regardless of the set size , due to rescaling of the measure @xmath871 by the measure of the spherical set to @xmath872 .",
    "therefore , those trajectories that lead to uniform decay of @xmath843 will first appear well distributed in @xmath7 over larger sets , and only then will they sample @xmath7 on smaller scales .",
    "conversely , @xmath868 does not make such a distinction , requiring that the trajectories distribute on all scales equally fast .    in practice ,",
    "the choice between @xmath843 and @xmath868 is driven by the application : for mixing of fluids , it was important that two reactants were in contact at the instant of reaction initiation , e.g. , initiation of burning in the chamber . in the search - and - rescue application ,",
    "instantaneous behavior was not of the essence , as the goal was to find the target over the entire course of the search mission , not necessarily to have the same ( high ) probability to locate the target at any particular time instance . in future applications ,",
    "a similar analysis of the problem would decide which property , ergodicity @xmath843 or mixing @xmath868 , would be a more appropriate design criterion .",
    "the indicators for ergodicity and mixing presented in this section are based on representations of ergodic measures in the space of fourier coefficients .",
    "they therefore represent ergodic measures as accurately as it is possible through their fourier coefficients : numerically , approximations will converge quicker the smoother the ergodic measure studied .",
    "however , it is well known that the shape of the ergodic measure s density does not determine uniquely the dynamical system . in this sense , the indicators are not intrinsic to the dynamical system studied . for example , if one would use a unique ergodic measure @xmath7 for a map @xmath873 and seek to drive the ergodic measure of another system @xmath874 to match @xmath7 , there would be no guarantee that trajectories of @xmath873 and @xmath874 would be conjugate , without further restrictions on properties of maps @xmath873 and @xmath874 .",
    "we have reviewed the theoretical aspects and applications of the spectral theory of the koopman operator in dynamical systems .",
    "the use of these concepts holds promise to provide a theory that extends and complements tools from geometrical dynamical systems theory that enabled so much development in science and technology over the last century .",
    "the presented material described three parallel branches of koopman operator analysis :    koopman mode analysis ,    eigenquotient analysis , and    indicators of ergodicity and mixing .",
    "the koopman modes generalize the notion of linear eigenmodes , known from , e.g. , linear mechanical vibration theory , to the nonlinear context , without linearizing the dynamics first .",
    "it is interesting that projections onto eigenspaces of the koopman operator are achieved via an extension of laplace and fourier analysis , and that such extension works in the nonlinear case .",
    "the koopman mode analysis has proved especially useful in analysis of dynamics in infinite - dimensional state spaces , which were observed using a high - dimensional measurements , e.g. , thermal dynamics of a building system , with a distributed measurement of temperatures or fluids experiments .",
    "the eigenquotient analysis generalizes the analysis of smooth integrals of motion , which is central in theoretical mechanics , to systems which do not have any smooth invariants .",
    "the non - smooth eigenfunctions are constructed using infinite - time averaging along trajectories of the dynamical system .",
    "the eigenfunctions are used to construct a geometry for families of invariant sets which can be used to extract invariant regions that locally resemble phase portraits of integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "the same analysis can not only be applied to the study of invariant sets , but also periodic and wandering sets .",
    "finally , we showed how the trajectory averages can be used even when only finite - time data is available .",
    "the values of finite - time averages of functions along trajectories can be used to evaluate quantitative indicators of how closely the system is to accurately sampling a prior measure .",
    "such indicators can be used as optimization criteria in a feedback algorithm for trajectory planning of unmanned aerial vehicles .",
    "the theory reviewed here was introduced and developed mostly for measure - preserving deterministic systems , including dynamics on the attractor of a dissipative system .",
    "much more work remains to be done in the case of dissipative systems and extensions to non - smooth and hybrid ( deterministic / stochastic ) case .",

    "<S> the first approach is based on the koopman modes , which generalize linear mode analysis from linear systems to nonlinear systems , while preserving global nonlinear features of the system , unlike , e.g. , linearizations based on taylor- and fourier- expansions . </S>",
    "<S> the second approach identifies coherent structures in flows . </S>",
    "<S> an equivalence relation between points in the state space can be defined using spectral properties of the koopman operator , where equivalent points correspond to initial conditions that behave statistically the same with respect to any observable . </S>",

    "<S> examples are taken from diverse areas such as fluid mechanics , fluid mixing , energy efficiency of buildings , power systems , and unmanned aerial vehicle path - planning for search - and - rescue . </S>",
    "<S> a common trait of all the methods is that they do not require access to an analytical model of the system ; the spectral properties of the koopman operator can be constructed from measured or simulated data . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ </S>"
