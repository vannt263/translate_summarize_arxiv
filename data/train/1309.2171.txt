    "<S> the scanning nv - center microscope makes use of an afm operating in tapping mode , whose tip is functionalized with a @xmath3-nm diamond nanocrystal hosting a single nv center . </S>",
    "<S> this defect , which has a paramagnetic ground state ( @xmath4 ) with a zero - field splitting @xmath5  ghz , can be considered as a single electronic spin nestled in the diamond matrix . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , it exhibits a spin - dependent photoluminescence ( pl ) under optical illumination , which enables measurements of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) by optical means  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin of the nv center then serves as an atomic - size magnetic sensor which provides quantitative magnetic field imaging by recording zeeman shifts of the nv defect electron spin sublevels  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the esr frequency is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ghz / t and @xmath8 is the magnetic field projection along the nv defect quantization axis . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the esr frequency is probed with a radiofrequency ( rf ) field while collecting the spin - dependent pl with a confocal microscope placed on top of the afm tip  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all the experiments presented in this article were performed with the same nv sensor , whose quantization axis forms spherical angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the sample reference frame [ fig . [ fig1](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> these angles were inferred by recording the esr frequency as a function of the amplitude and orientation of a calibrated magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic sample , which is composed of thermally evaporated disks of permalloy ( ni@xmath11fe@xmath12 ) , with a thickness @xmath13  nm and a @xmath14-@xmath15 m diameter , were prepared by electron - beam lithography and lift - off on a silicon substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium magnetization of these ferromagnetic microstructures is a vortex state . </S>",
    "<S> + the stray magnetic field above the vortex structure was first studied with the scanning nv microscope operating in ` dual - iso - b ' imaging mode . </S>",
    "<S> this method provides magnetic images exhibiting iso - magnetic - field contours corresponding to two different values of @xmath8  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , figure  [ fig1](c ) shows the ` dual - iso - b ' image recorded simultaneously with the afm image shown in figure  [ fig1](b ) , with iso - b contours corresponding to @xmath16  mt and @xmath17  mt . </S>",
    "<S> since the flux - closed vortex structure does not radiate any stray field , the only pattern observed in the magnetic image is due to the vortex core at the center of the disk , where the magnetization points out of the plane . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with a previous work on ferromagnetic square dots , where the stray field produced by nel walls at the square diagonals overwhelms that of the vortex core  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](d ) shows a high - resolution ` dual - iso - b ' image of the disk center , which unambiguously reveals the vortex core . in order to obtain the full magnetic field distribution above the vortex core , the value of @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> was then measured at each pixel of the scan by employing a lock - in method which enables real - time tracking of the esr frequency , as explained in details in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> this method provides a fully quantitative map of the stray field produced by the vortex core , as illustrated in fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> we note that the stray field spreads over @xmath18  nm , which corresponds to the resolving power of the scanning - nv microscope , _ </S>",

    "<S> as discussed later in the paper , the resolving power is limited by the probe - to - sample distance . however , we stress that since the nv defect senses the field within an atomic - size detection volume , magnetic field distributions are recorded with nanoscale spatial resolution , even with a large probe - to - sample distance . </S>",
    "<S> + in view of comparing the recorded magnetic image to micromagnetic predictions , the equilibrium magnetization distribution inside the thin disk of permalloy was computed using oommf software  @xcite . for this calculation , we used a saturation magnetization @xmath19  a / m , an exchange constant @xmath20  j / m and a magnetization cell size @xmath21 , which is below the micromagnetic exchange length in order to describe the vortex core structure precisely . from the calculated equilibrium magnetization , </S>",
    "<S> the stray magnetic field was computed by summing the contribution of all magnetization cells , and then projected along the nv defect axis in order to reach a map of @xmath22  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only a priori unknown parameter of the simulation is the probe - to - sample distance @xmath23 , since the position of the nv probe with respect to the apex of the afm tip is not precisely controlled . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter was indirectly inferred by calculating the stray field at different distances @xmath23 and by choosing the one that gives the same maximum value for @xmath8 as in the experiment , _ </S>",
    "<S> _ @xmath17  mt in the conditions of figure  [ fig1](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion relies on the strong distance dependence of the stray field above the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> we found that a probe - to - sample distance @xmath24 nm leads to a simulated stray field distribution with a maximum value for @xmath8 of @xmath17  mt , as in the experiment , while for instance @xmath25 nm and @xmath26 nm would give about @xmath27  mt and @xmath28  mt , respectively  @xcite . figures [ fig1](f ) to ( h ) show the simulated images corresponding to the experimental images depicted in figure  [ fig1](c ) to ( e ) assuming @xmath24 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the asymmetry observed in the simulations results from the imperfect alignment of the nv defect quantization axis with respect to the @xmath29-axis [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated magnetic field distribution is in general agreement with the experimental data , with a stray field spread over @xmath18  nm . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnetic image also reveals slight deviations from an ideal vortex structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute these variations to imperfections of the magnetic structure , as discussed later in the article . </S>",
    "<S> + the probe - to - sample distance inferred from comparisons with micromagnetic simulations might seem surprisingly large given the 40-nm size of the diamond nanocrystal , measured by afm prior grafting onto the tip . </S>",
    "<S> two effects can explain this observation , as illustrated in figure  [ fig2](a ) : ( i ) the diamond nanocrystal may actually be placed well above the end of the tip ; ( ii ) the afm tip , operated in tapping mode , oscillates vertically , resulting in a time - dependent distance @xmath30 with a mean value @xmath31 . to quantify the latter effect , the acquisition of esr spectra </S>",
    "<S> was synchronized with the tip oscillation  @xcite , whose frequency is about @xmath32  khz . </S>",
    "<S> for these measurements , the tip was placed above the vortex core and the spin - dependent pl intensity of the nv defect was stroboscopically recorded within a detection window of duration @xmath33s , much shorter than the tip oscillation period , while sweeping the frequency of the rf field . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting esr spectra are shown in figure  [ fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the esr frequency @xmath34 is shifted towards a higher value when the tip is at its lowermost position ( bottom panel ) compared with the uppermost position ( middle panel ) , indicating a change of the local magnetic field @xmath8 within the tip oscillation . for comparison , the esr spectrum shown in the top panel </S>",
    "<S> is obtained without synchronization , leading to averaging over the magnetic field modulation induced by the tip oscillation . in figure  [ fig2](c ) , the magnetic field @xmath8 extracted from tip - synchronized esr spectra is plotted as a function of the detection time within the tip oscillation period . </S>",
    "<S> a sinusoidal behavior is observed , which is the signature of the tip oscillation . in order to infer an estimate of the oscillation amplitude </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the vortex core as a point - like magnetic dipole with a stray field scaling as @xmath35 . this assumption is valid as long as the probe - to - sample distance remains significantly larger than the magnetic sample thickness ( @xmath13  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relative variations of @xmath23 and @xmath8 within the tip oscillation are then linked by @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath37 variation of the stray magnetic field therefore translates into a @xmath38 oscillation of the probe - to - sample distance . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the data shown in figure  [ fig1 ] corresponds to a mean probe - to - sample distance of @xmath39 nm with an oscillation amplitude @xmath40 nm . for magnetometry , the main consequences of this oscillation are ( i ) a broadened esr line with reduced contrast which degrades the measurement sensitivity  @xcite , and ( ii ) an increased mean tip - to - sample distance . however , in the present case these contributions are weak and the @xmath41-nm mean distance is attributed to imperfect positioning of the diamond nanocrystal at the end of the afm tip . </S>",
    "<S> note that the tip oscillation could also be used as a resource , either to extract three - dimensional information in a single scan  @xcite , or to implement high - sensitivity ac magnetometry protocols  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> e.g. _ by using diamond nanopillar probes  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , bringing the nv sensor very close to the sample surface would require to measure magnetic fields in the tesla range for common ferromagnetic samples , such as the vortex structures investigated in this work . at such high fields , magnetometry based on measurements of zeeman shifts of the nv defect electron spin sublevels </S>",
    "<S> is unpractical since the field is strong enough to induce electron spin mixing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , nv - based magnetometry is intrinsically limited to magnetic fields with an amplitude and an orientation such that the electron spin quantization axis remains fixed by the nv defect axis itself , corresponding to magnetic field amplitudes lower than few tenths of mt  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ultimate resolving power of scanning - nv magnetometry is a compromise between small probe - to - sample distance and sensing fields lower than few tenths of mt . </S>",
    "<S> +    mt . in the left panels , </S>",
    "<S> the black arrows indicate the curling magnetization of the vortex state and the red dot shows the out - of - plane magnetization of the vortex core , which is moved away from the center of the structure when a bias field is applied . </S>",
    "<S> the blue arrow depicts the net in - plane magnetization induced by vortex core displacement . </S>",
    "<S> the middle and right panels show the measured and simulated magnetic field images , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the bias magnetic field is experimentally aligned along the in - plane projection of the nv center s quantization axis . </S>",
    "<S> integration time per pixel : 60 ms for ( a ) , 40 ms for ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    next , we applied an in - plane bias magnetic field to the vortex structure and investigated its effect on the stray field . with a @xmath42  mt bias field , </S>",
    "<S> the vortex core is displaced away from the dot center , perpendicularly to the field direction , by @xmath43 nm according to micromagnetic simulations . even though such a small shift is hard to observe directly , the vortex core displacement breaks the symmetry of the magnetization structure , which results in a net in - plane magnetization parallel to the bias field and delocalized over the whole disk . </S>",
    "<S> this in - plane magnetic moment produces a stray field that adds up to that of the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows dual - iso - b images recorded with and without the in - plane bias field . when a bias field is applied [ fig  [ fig3](b ) ] , a two - lobe pattern spread over the whole disk is observed , as expected for an in - plane magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> this is in clear contrast with the zero - bias - field case , for which the stray field , which comes exclusively from the vortex core , is highly localized at the center of the disk [ fig  [ fig3](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding simulated images reproduce well the dramatic change induced by the in - plane bias field . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements therefore reveal indirectly the nanoscale vortex core displacement induced by the bias field .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , several other ferromagnetic dots were imaged with the same nv sensor . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4 ] shows dual - iso - b images for three different dots . in each case , the vortex core is clearly distinguishable near the dot center , highlighted by the high - value iso - b contour ( in red ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the low - value contours ( @xmath44 mt ) reveal additional features in the stray field measured above the dots , which appear to be randomly distributed over the structure . </S>",
    "<S> since those features differ from dot to dot , we attribute them to imperfections of the fabricated structures , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ edge and surface roughness . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , dot # 3 exhibits a spot of stray field next to the vortex core that reaches @xmath45 mt in value . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected spot is likely due to some defect that either skews the vortex core or breaks the symmetry of the in - plane vortex distribution , producing additional stray field that interferes with the intrinsic vortex core stray field . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain the distortion observed in figure  [ fig1](d),(e ) .        in conclusion , we used a scanning nv - center microscope to quantitatively map the stray magnetic field above the vortex core of a ferromagnetic microdisk . </S>",
    "<S> this work demonstrates the effectiveness of nv - based magnetometry to obtain quantitative information on the stray field above magnetic nanostructures with high spatial and field resolution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , weak perturbations with respect to the perfect vortex structure have been clearly detected , due to an applied field or imperfections of the magnetic samples . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity to weak magnetic fields , at the nanoscale , opens the door to the detection of exotic magnetic structures like skyrmions in ultrathin films  @xcite . </S>",
