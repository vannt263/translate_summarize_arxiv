    "[ [ section ] ]    as the most amazing and even paradoxical one in elementary particles , neutrino has been known to us for a long time since 1931 , when wolfgang pauli proposed a new particle  very penetrating and neutral  in @xmath5-dacay .",
    "nevertheless , we do nt know much about neutrino itself .",
    "that is mainly because of experimental difficulty to detect neutrino itself and neutrino events too . up to now , we are not quite sure if neutrino has a rest mass or not , and also we can not explain _ solar neutrino deficit_@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite contrary to the expectation from standard solar model@xcite . furthermore , nature does nt seem to be fair in _",
    "weak interaction _ in which neutrino is involved . that has been known as _",
    "parity violation_.    [ [ section-1 ] ]    as one of trial solutions to explain the _ solar neutrino deficit _ , neutrino _ mass _ or _ flavor _ oscillation has been suggested , and many experiments have been done and doing until now .",
    "however , in the theory of neutrino flavor oscillation , it is supposed that neutrino , for instance , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 , is not in a fundamental state in quantum mechanical point of view , but in a mixed state with _ mass eigenstates _",
    ", such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this supposition implies that neutrino has an intrinsic structure and , thus , one of flavors spontaneously transforms to another kind of flavors , like the conversion of meson @xmath13 into its antiparticle @xmath14 .",
    "if neutrino flavor mixing is true , we have another dilemma in _ lepton number _ conservation , which has been quite acceptable in phenomenology . in section(1.2 ) , we are going to compare neutrino flavor mixing with the @xmath13 and @xmath14 mixing .",
    "moreover , the theory itself will be reviewed if it is physically sound or not .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in weak interaction , we know that _",
    "parity _ is violated . when c. s. wu _ et al _ showed parity violation in their experiment@xcite , it was astonishing because we had believed in a fairness in natural phenomena .",
    "up to now , we do nt know the reason for _ parity violation _ , and also we can not explain why _ parity violation _ is detected only in weak interaction .",
    "should we accept this fact as nature itself ? otherwise , there should be a reasonable reason .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    as mentioned above , the experimentation is difficult because neutrinos have extremely small cross - sections(typical cross - section : @xmath15 @xmath16 ( 1gev)@xcite ) ; furthermore , neutrinos participate in only weak interaction in which the interaction range and the relative strength are @xmath17(@xmath18 ) and @xmath19 , respectively.@xcite meanwhile , if the interaction range and the relative strength are compared with electromagnetic interaction case(range : @xmath20 , relative strength : @xmath21)@xcite , it is not easy [ for us ] to understand why electromagnetic interaction - intermediated by _ photon _  is suppressed in the weak interaction range despite that its interaction range is @xmath20 and the relative strength is @xmath21 which is @xmath22 times bigger than weak interaction one.@xcite      [ [ section-4 ] ]    through the complex space model@xcite , it was possible to understand how special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics can be connected , what is the physical entity of wave function ",
    "ontological point of view  in quantum mechanics , and how schrdinger equation is related to the complex space model@xcite . in that , dirac s _ hole theory_@xcite was re - interpreted as following : in the complex space , vacuum particles  vacuum electrons in the model  are not packed completely ; they can transfer energy(for instance , electromagnetic energy ) through a wave motion such as _ vacuum - string - oscillation_. in which the electromagnetic energy is propagated along the imaginary axis , and it is realized to real space through u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    in quantum physics , we know that the _ phase factor _ of wave function is arbitrary if we consider only probability density(@xmath23 ) ; yet , it need to be considered in physical interactions .",
    "especially , its peculiarity was shown by berry , m.v . in considering slowly evolving quantum phase in the interaction of fermion(for example , electron ) with magnetic field , and it has been known as _",
    "berry phase_.@xcite@xcite    now , let us think about what the electron s spin is and , in general , what the fermion(electron , proton , neutron , etc ) is .",
    "first of all , we know that the electron s spin can be represented as a rotation in _ two dimensional complex space _ , that is su(2 ) ; and the spin vector is realized through an interaction in which the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath24(@xmath25:pauli matrix , @xmath26:constant).@xcite furthermore , we can physically surmise that the peculiarity of quantum phase occurs when the spin vector in su(2 ) is realized through the interaction with magnetic field because of the difference between su(2 ) and so(3 )  two to one correspondence in their parameter spaces even though both are similar groups . here , we can be sure , at least , that electron s spin vector ( axial vector ) resides in the complex space .    according to the interpretation of quantum formalism in the complex space @xcite",
    ", quantum phase corresponds to the phase itself in the complex space .",
    "although the quantum phase in a stationary system is arbitrary ",
    "u(1 )  and does nt affect physical interpretation , in a dynamical system the phase is no more free to choose . as a specific and simple example of berry phase ,",
    "let us imagine following : one electron(spin @xmath27 ) is at origin under the influence of magnetic field(@xmath28 ) which is on @xmath29-@xmath30 plane with pointing to the origin .",
    "now , let the field pointing direction rotate slowly around @xmath31 axis ; then , the system is in so(2 ) @xmath32 so(3 ) in real space and u(1 ) @xmath32 su(2 ) in the complex space because of the correspondence between su(2 ) and so(3 ) ; u(1 ) and so(2 ) in their transformations . here , u(1 ) is different from the one we traditionally use since our concern is u(1 ) in the internal complex space .",
    "now let us say , the electron s spin points to the positive @xmath29 axis at the beginning . and let the field direction rotate with @xmath33 degrees which corresponds to @xmath34 rotating simultaneously in the internal complex space .",
    "after a round trip of the system(@xmath35 ) in real space , we can easily recognize that the spin points to the other direction  the negative @xmath29 axis .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    from pauli exclusion principle we know that any two identical fermions can not be at the same quantum state , but bosons can share the same state .",
    "that means , the wave function representing two identical fermion system is anti - symmetry , but the wave function of two identical bosons is symmetry . to demonstrate this fact , let us say , @xmath36 represents the quantum state for two identical fermions .",
    "then , @xmath37{}\\psi(1,2 ) =   - { \\rm p}\\makebox[0.4 mm]{}\\psi(1,2)$ ] , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are respectively _ exchange _ and _ parity _ operator and it was used the fact that exchange operator(@xmath38 ) is identical to parity operator(@xmath39 ) for this two identical fermion system . in fig.([fermion ] ) total spin vector(axial ) in two identical fermion system is in internal complex space . after space inversion or parity operation",
    "the quantum phase is changed from @xmath40 to @xmath41 with showing how the anti - symmetric wave function(two - fermion system ) and the parity operation are connected .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    with this fact we can distinguish _ fermion _ and _ boson_. fermion has a spin  intrinsic angular moment(half integer @xmath42 )  in complex space ; boson can also have a spin , but the spin vector ( axial ) is in real space .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    one of long standing questions related elusive particle , neutrino , is neutrino oscillation . to understand the theory of neutrino oscillation",
    ", firstly we have to assume that each flavor of neutrinos(@xmath43 ) has a rest mass . of course ,",
    "@xmath44 to be meaningful in the theory .",
    "furthermore we have to suppose that there are fundamental quantum states , in which the individual mass eigenstate does nt appear in phenomenon , but linear combinations of these states emerge to @xmath45 or @xmath8 .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    * in the respect of quantum formalism :* to describe _",
    "one _ particle system , the wave function is a linear combination with all possible quantum states  orthogonal and complete set of bases .",
    "there , each state represents _ the particle _ itself with a probability .",
    "now , if the particle changes its identity , for instance , from @xmath46 to @xmath7 , can we still use the same complete basis set to describe the new one ? or should we change the basis set to new one also ? according to the theory , we can use the same basis set to describe these phenomenologically different particles because these particles are fundamentally identical but in different states to each other .",
    "however , @xmath13 and @xmath14 mixing is different from neutrino flavor mixing case because they have internal structures and thus can be different intrinsic parities . in phenomenon , they appear to have different properties and transform spontaneously to each other with exchanging @xmath47(pions ) .",
    "now what about neutrinos ?",
    "do they have been known they have internal structures and different intrinsic parities ?",
    "although it has been known that neutrinos have imaginary intrinsic parities@xcite , it does nt make any sense in phenomenology .",
    "what about in the middle of oscillation ?",
    "for instance , `` @xmath48 @xmath46 and @xmath48 @xmath7 '' is possible ?",
    "although we can use quantum formalism to describe a physical system , the particle s identity in the physical system should be clear at any time .",
    "otherwise , there should be an additional explanation why the fundamental mass states are beyond physical phenomena .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    * energy and momentum conservation : * let us say , rest mass @xmath49  electron neutrino  is moving in an isolated system with velocity @xmath50 at @xmath51 , and after @xmath52 seconds(@xmath52 is arbitrary ) the mass is changed to rest mass @xmath53(@xmath54 )  muon neutrino  and the velocity to @xmath55 .",
    "first of all , energy conservation should be satisfied as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , moreover their momentums also should be conserved as @xmath60 if the masses , @xmath49 and @xmath53 are different , both equations , eqn.([e - conser ] ) and eqn.([p - conser ] ) , can not be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    even though our concerning is different in special theory of relativity and quantum physics , both theories should be equally satisfied by a new theory because they are basic theories in physics and connected fundamentally .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    to describe spin @xmath61 particle(fermion ) , two formalisms  dirac@xcite@xcite and majorana@xcite@xcite @xcite formalism  have been known . since both formalisms are not derived directly from schdinger equation",
    " that is not deductive but inductive , it is natural [ for us ] to check if these two formalisms are physically enough meaningful or not .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    in majorana case ; neutrino and antineutrino are identical such as @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( majorana abbreviation ) , and neutrino has a rest mass(@xmath64 ) .",
    "although the first condition is tolerable in the respect of phenomenological facts that we could nt have detected @xmath65 and @xmath1 , the second one is not compatible with special theory of relativity .",
    "if @xmath64 no matter how small it is , then we can find the neutrino rest frame through proper lorentz transformation ; furthermore , we can even flip the helicity from right - handed(@xmath66 ) to left - handed(@xmath67 ) or _",
    "vice versa_. because there are only two kinds of neutrinos , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the flipped one is always corresponded to the other one .",
    "however , obviously we can distinguish @xmath67 from @xmath68 in their properties.@xcite@xcite for instance , in interactions ; @xmath69 and @xmath70 , their total cross sections , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are different.@xcite if majorana neutrinos can be applicable in physics , they should be identical in their physical properties , that is , @xmath73 . yet",
    ", the total cross section can be changed suddenly at a critical boost velocity in the transformation in spite of the fact that the cross section should be invariant .",
    "that means , a physical fact , which should be unique in all lorentz frames , can be changed through the transformation .",
    "therefore , both conditions in majorana formalism can not be feasible in physical situation as long as special theory of relativity is impeccable . about the neutrino mass",
    ", there was already a similar argument in the respect of group theory in 1957@xcite .",
    "therefore , neutrinos satisfied by both conditions are not appropriate in physics .",
    "if we abandon the first condition but still assume that neutrino mass is not zero , we have to treat neutrinos as like other spin @xmath61 fermions  not majorana type fermions .",
    "however , what if we give up the mass of neutrino but hold the first condition , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ? then , we have to ask again the old questions if @xmath1 and @xmath2 exist or not ; if these two neutrinos exist , why we can not detect them ; why parity is violated in weak interaction . as a possible case , let us assume that neutrino has no mass ( @xmath0 ) and that @xmath1 and @xmath2 exist but we could nt have detected them yet .",
    "if this supposition , which corresponds to majorana neutrino with setting @xmath74 to zero@xcite , is true , we can understand why parity violation happens in weak interaction ; moreover , we can find a clue to understand _ solar neutrino deficit _ problem .    in dirac formalism ;",

    "phenomenological facts  neutrinos have an extremely small cross section , and electromagnetic interaction is highly suppressed in weak interaction limit(@xmath18 )  can be a good clue to understand neutrino . in",
    "what follows , we are going to propose what is _ neutrino _ and what is a possible model of @xmath3 boson with which _ parity violation _ can be explained .      since electromagnetic wave , on which rest mass can not be defined ,",

    "furthermore , there is a limit of photon energy because @xmath88 is not zero  the vacuum string oscillation is not through a continuous medium .",
    "for example , wavelengths of t@xmath94 and p@xmath94 energy photons , p@xmath95 , e@xmath96 are @xmath18 and @xmath97 , respectively . but e@xmath94 energy photon is not possible because the wavelength(@xmath98 ) is smaller than @xmath88 . as a reference ,",
    "p@xmath94 energy order @xmath99 rays have been detected in cosmic ray experiments.@xcite    for neutrino to propagate weak interaction region(@xmath18 ) there is a mode in which only two independent states exist , that is _ longitudinal vacuum string oscillation _ in which spin state(helicity ) is also transferred through the string oscillation . with this model",
    "we can estimate bare electron size by a crude comparison of compton scattering with neutrino and electron elastic scattering(@xmath100 ) .",
    "let us say , the ratio of compton scattering total cross section ray to avoid hadronic interaction ] to the elastic scattering cross section @xmath101 is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is bare electron radius . for 1 m@xmath94 of @xmath6 and photon in electron rest frame ,",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105.@xcite then , the ratio , @xmath106 , and the bare electron radius can be estimated as @xmath107 .",
    "through experimental facts we have known that @xmath65 and @xmath1 do nt exist in nature .",
    "yet we need to distinguish the existence in phenomenology and in ontology .",
    "if @xmath65 and @xmath1 exist , necessarily we need an explanation why these two neutrinos could nt have been detected .",
    "for example , in @xmath108 decay of @xmath109 one proton is converted to a neutron inside the nucleus with emitting a positron @xmath110 and an electron neutrino @xmath6 .",
    "that is @xmath111 . in this process of weak interaction",
    "it has been known that @xmath112 boson intermediate the process and the neutrino @xmath6 is _ left handed _ electron neutrino . however ,",
    "if we assume @xmath112 boson(@xmath113 g@xmath94 , @xmath114@xcite ) as a momentary interacting state of a positron and _ virtual positive charge strings _ moving around the positron , we can figure out from fig.([w_boson ] ) that there is no more preference in the neutrino helicity if the magnetic field is turned off .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    in fig.([w_boson ] ) @xmath110 represents bare charge of the positron , and @xmath115 stands for the virtual positive charge strings induced from vacuum polarization@xcite . in which the virtual positive charge strings might even have a distribution depending on radial distance from the positron . although we do nt expect a positively induced virtual charges from the vacuum polarization if the positron is in a free space , inside weak interaction region(@xmath116 ) the virtual positive charges can be accumulated around the edge of the region and even experienced a repulsive force from the edge . according to the mirror image in dirac s hole theory",
    "the virtual - positive - charges behave like that they have _ positive _ masses in phenomena .    since the state , interacting between the positron and virtual - positive - charges , is not stable , soon it decay to a free positron and a neutrino , in which the kinetic energy of the virtual - positive - charges is transferred to the longitudinal vacuum string oscillation , that can be interpreted as neutrino as assumed before . now , if magnetic field @xmath28 is applied as in fig.([w_boson ] ) to investigate the positron s spin orientation we can use faraday induction law , which is an empirical and macroscopic law , because the radius of @xmath117 is much bigger than the bare electron size(@xmath118 ) .",
    "then , the virtual - positive - charges rotating around the positron move to the negative z - axis(attractive in faraday induction law ) and finally it will be transferred to the longitudinal vacuum string oscillation  neutrino  following negative imaginary z - axis as in the case of photon@xcite because neutrino mass @xmath119 is assumed to be zero . on the other hand ,",
    "the positron must move to the positive z - axis because of momentum conservation .",
    "if total spin of the system was @xmath120 pointing to the positive z - axis , the emitting electron neutrino definitely has _",
    "left handed _",
    "what if the magnetic fields is turned off ?",
    "we can not say which direction the neutrino choose for its emitting . from a reasonable guess",
    ", we can say that it should be equally probable for each direction .",
    "in @xmath121 decay , that is @xmath122 , @xmath123 boson also can be treated similarly as in @xmath112 boson case if we remind of the mirror image in dirac s hole theory , where @xmath123 boson is considered as a momentary state of an electron @xmath124 and virtual - negative - charge strings moving around the electron , and the virtual - negative - charge strings behave like that they have negative masses . with a similar set up like fig.([w_boson ] ) except negative charges and the other rotating direction of the virtual - negative- charge strings , we can find out that the emitting electron neutrino is now _",
    "right handed _ if the magnetic fields is on , and equally probable to be _ right handed _ or _",
    "left handed _",
    "if the magnetic field is off .",
    "similarly , we can assume further that @xmath125 boson is a momentary interacting state(@xmath126 ) between virtual - positive - charge strings and virtual - negative - charge strings inside the weak interaction region(@xmath127 ) .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    from the reasoning as above , it is reasonable to say that the _ parity violation _ can be happened if we consider only one part of phenomena , in which we can investigate the spin orientation of lepton using magnetic field ; however , _ intrinsically _ parity is conserved if vacuum is magnetic field free .      from experimental results@xcite",
    "we can be sure that there are at least three kinds of flavors  @xmath128 .",
    "up to now , it seems that we have assumed only one kind of neutrino because we can not distinguish neutrino flavors with one longitudinal vacuum string oscillation model .",
    "yet , there is a way to distinguish them .",
    "if neutrino propagation is assumed as a bundle of vacuum string oscillations in general , each flavor of neutrinos can be distinguished as a bulk motion with a different number of vacuum string oscillations .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    if there exist the counter parts of left - handed neutrino @xmath67 and right - handed antineutrino @xmath68 as assumed before , the parity should be conserved .",
    "moreover , we found in the model of @xmath3 bosons that the helicity of neutrino is affected by the external magnetic field .    with these facts ,",
    "let us try to find a possible explanation for the solar neutrino problem as mentioned before .",
    "for example , @xmath129b - neutrino deficit@xcite as @xmath130 was confirmed again by super - kamiokande@xcite experimental result . if solar magnetic field does nt affect on helicities of neutrinos ,",

    "neutrino and _ left handed _",
    "neutrino to electron , the ratio of @xmath131 to @xmath132 is @xmath133 for @xmath129b - neutrinos.@xcite hence , with this fact we can estimate that @xmath134 should be @xmath135 .",
    "in fact , it is still bigger than the experimental result of @xmath136 .",
    "although it is not easy to estimate how much solar magnetic field affect on solar neutrinos(helicity and radiational direction ) , we can suppose that the neutrino flux itself from the sun is not _",
    "isotropic_. in the model of @xmath112 boson in fig.([w_boson ] ) , we considered that virtual positive - charge - string is affected during the disintegration to @xmath110 and @xmath6 ( @xmath137 )  faraday induction law .",
    "if neutrinos , those of which we are looking for on earth , emit from the equatorial zone of the sun , then the direction of emission possibly can be deviated from the equatorial plane of the sun .",
    "this effect should reduce the neutrino flux to @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , we can expect that the smaller energy neutrinos , the more strong deviations . in kamiokande experimental result(1994)@xcite , we can confirm this effect by comparing neutrino spectrums in the measurements and from the monte carlo simulation , that is the expectation from standard solar model .",
    "[ [ section-17 ] ]    it has been known that dirac equation represents spin @xmath61 fermions . through this letter we compared dirac formalism and majorana formalism for neutrino case .",
    "before that , we investigated how pauli exclusion principle is related to fermions in the complex space@xcite and if neutrino oscillation is physically feasible or not .",
    "in short , neutrino oscillation is not compatible with special theory of relativity .",
    "that is , as long as special theory of relativity is impeccable , neutrino flavor oscillation is not possible .    for neutrino",
    ", majorana type neutrino was rejected in considering experimental results@xcite@xcite .",
    "if neutrino has rest mass , it should be treated like other spin @xmath139 fermions .",
    "however , we assumed that neutrino has no mass ; right - handed neutrino @xmath1 and left - handed antineutrino @xmath65 exist . here , we use neutrino and antineutrino , but they are not different even though we use them traditionally in dirac four spinor formalism .",
    "there are only two physically distinctive neutrinos for each kind  _ right - handed _ and _ left - handed _ . from this fact and under the assumption that neutrino has no rest mass , the longitudinal vacuum string oscillation was suggested for neutrino . moreover , the intermediate bosons @xmath3 was also suggested as a model because it is necessary that _ parity _ should be conserved if right - handed neutrino @xmath1 and left - handed antineutrino @xmath65 exist . in the model of @xmath3 bosons , we also found how we might have overlooked the truth .",
    "meanwhile , v - a theory , with which the interaction hamiltonian in weak interaction has been formulated , is not enough to include @xmath1 and @xmath2 . instead , both v - a and v+a theories should be considered because we are assuming _ parity _ conservation  that means existing the mirror image . moreover",
    ", the _ lepton number _ conservation law should be extended to include the other part , that might be a pair of _ lepton number _ conservations , separately .",
