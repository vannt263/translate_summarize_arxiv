    "recently , a new class of x - ray transients has been recognized .",
    "the wide field cameras ( wfcs ) on the bepposax in the x - ray range @xmath6 have detected some fast x - ray transients ( fxts ) with a duration less than @xmath7 , which are not triggered and not detected by the gamma ray burst monitor ( grbm ) in the @xmath0-ray range @xmath8 ( heise et al .",
    "2001 ; see also strohmayer et al .",
    "1998 ; gotthelf , hamilton & helfand 1996 ; hamilton , gotthlf & helfand 1996 ) . in heise",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) , these fxts are defined as x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) .",
    "this definition of xrfs excludes the x - ray counterparts of the typical gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) including x - ray - rich grbs .",
    "seventeen xrfs have been observed in the wfcs on the bepposax in about 5 yr , while 49 grb counterparts have been observed in the same period .",
    "xrfs have the following properties ( heise et al .",
    "( i ) the peak flux of the xrfs ranges between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( fig .  2 of heise et al .",
    "the mean peak flux of the xrfs is about a factor of 3 smaller than that of the grbs .",
    "nine out of 17 xrfs are detected in either the lowest or the lowest two batse energy channels ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; kippen et al .",
    "( ii ) the ratio of the peak flux and the fluence in the x - ray range ( @xmath13 ) and the @xmath0-ray range ( @xmath14 ) for nine xrfs are shown in fig .  3 of heise et al .",
    "the peak flux ratio extends up to a factor of 100 , and the fluence ratio extends up to a factor of 20 .",
    "( iii ) the energy spectrum in the range @xmath6 fits with a single power low with the photon index between 1.2 and 3 and the mean of about 2 , while the mean photon index of 36 grbs in the same x - ray band is about 1 , with the range between 0.5 and 3 .",
    "( iv ) the duration of the xrfs ranges between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which is the same order as that of the grbs .",
    "( v ) the event rate of the xrfs is estimated as @xmath17 yr@xmath18 since the wfcs observed @xmath19 yr@xmath18 with the covering @xmath20 ( full width to zero response ) .",
    "( vi ) the sky distribution is consistent with being isotropic .",
    "the spatial distribution is consistent with being homogeneous in euclidean space since @xmath21 ( heise et al .",
    "2000 ; schmidt , higdon & hueter 1988 ) .",
    "at present , the origin of the xrfs is not known .",
    "heise et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have proposed that xrfs could be grbs at large redshift @xmath22 , when @xmath0-rays would be shifted into the x - ray range . however , as they have pointed out in their paper , one can not explain the duration distribution since no time dilation due to cosmological expansion is observed .",
    "there is also a possibility that the xrfs could be dirty fireballs or failed grbs ( e.g. , dermer , chiang & bttcher1999 ; heise et al .",
    "2001 ; huang , dai & lu 2002 ) .",
    "ioka & nakamura ( 2001 ) have proposed that the xrfs could be grbs observed from the large viewing angle as shown in figure  [ fig : model ] ( see also nakamura 2000 ) .",
    "they computed the kinematical dependence of the peak luminosity , the pulse width and the spectral lag of the peak luminosity on the viewing angle @xmath23 of a jet . for appropriate model parameters they obtained the peak luminosity - spectral lag relation similar to the observed one .",
    "they suggested that the viewing angle of the jet might cause various relations in grbs such as the peak luminosity - variability relation and the luminosity - width relation .",
    "very recently several authors have also suggested that the viewing angle is the key parameter to understand the various properties of the grbs ( zhang & m@xmath24sz@xmath25ros 2001 ; rossi , lazzati & rees 2001 ; salmonson & galama 2001 ) . in this circumstance , it is meaningful to study the off - axis grb model for the xrfs by ioka & nakamura ( 2001 ) in more detail .    in this letter , we will show that the grbs observed from the large viewing angle possesses the above - mentioned properties ( i)-(vi ) of the xrfs . in   [ sec : model ] we describe a simple jet model for the xrfs . in   [ sec : ratio ] we consider the peak flux ratio and the fluence ratio ( property ( ii ) ) . in   [ sec : index ] we consider the peak flux , the photon index and the event rate ( properties ( i ) , ( iii ) and ( v ) ) .",
    "  [ sec : dis ] is devoted to discussion ( properties ( iv ) and ( vi ) ) .",
    "we apply a simple jet model by ioka & nakamura ( 2001 ) to the xrfs .",
    "there are three timescales that determine the temporal pulse structure of the xrfs : the hydrodynamic timescale @xmath26 , the cooling timescale @xmath27 , and the angular spreading timescale @xmath28 ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ; katz 1997 ; fenimore , madras & nayakshin 1996 ) .",
    "since we consider that xrfs are the grbs observed from the large viewing angle , we assume @xmath29 as in the case of grbs ( e.g. , piran 1999 ; sari , narayan & piran 1996 ) . we adopt an instantaneous emission of an infinitesimally thin shell at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "then the observed flux of a single pulse at the observed time @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 } \\over{\\left[\\gamma^2 ( 1-\\beta\\cos\\theta(t))\\right]^2 } } , \\label{eq : jetthin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 determines the normalization of emissivity , and @xmath37 represents the spectral shape ( for details , see ioka & nakamura 2001 , granot , piran & sari 1999 , and woods & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "let the jet opening half - angle and the viewing angle be @xmath38 and @xmath23 , respectively ( see figure 1 ) . for @xmath39 , @xmath40 ,",

    "@xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "a pulse starts at @xmath50))$ ] and ends at @xmath51 .",
    "the spectrum of the grbs is well approximated by the band spectrum ( band et al . 1993 ) . in order to have a spectral shape similar to the band spectrum , we adopt the following form of the spectrum in the comoving frame , @xmath52^ { ( \\beta_b-\\alpha_b)/s } , \\label{eq : spectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the low ( high ) energy power law index , and @xmath55 describes the smoothness of the transition between the high and low energy . in the grbs , @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "are typical values ( preece et al .",
    "equations ( [ eq : jetthin ] ) and ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) are the basic equations to calculate the flux of a single pulse , which depends on 10 parameters for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .    in order to study the dependence on the viewing angle @xmath23 , we fix parameters as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , since typical grbs have a break energy of @xmath73 ( preece et al .",
    "2000 ) and a pulse duration of @xmath74 .",
    "other parameters , i.e. , the viewing angle @xmath75 , the high energy power law index @xmath54 and the distance @xmath66 , are varied depending on circumstances .",
    "we fix the amplitude @xmath67 so that the isotropic @xmath0-ray energy @xmath76 equals @xmath77 when @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 is the fluence in the energy range @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the flux in the same energy range .",
    "the result is @xmath83 note that when we adopt @xmath84 , the opening half - angle of the jet is similar to the observed one , @xmath85 , and the total energy corrected for geometry is comparable to the observed value , @xmath86 ( frail et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in this section , we calculate the peak flux ratio @xmath87 and the fluence ratio @xmath88 and compare the results with observations .    figure  [ fig : ratio ] shows the peak flux ratio @xmath89 and the fluence ratio @xmath90 as a function of the viewing angle @xmath75 . when the viewing angle @xmath23 is larger than the opening half - angle @xmath38 , both the peak flux ratio @xmath89 and the fluence ratio @xmath90 increase as the viewing angle @xmath75 increases .",
    "the ratios , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , increase as the high - energy index @xmath54 decreases",
    ".    we can understand this behavior as follows .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the maximum frequency @xmath91 at which most of the radiation energy is emitted is estimated as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 \\simeq [ 1+\\gamma^2 ( \\theta_v-\\delta \\theta)^2]/2\\gamma$ ] is the doppler factor and @xmath94 .",
    "thus the maximum frequency @xmath91 decreases as the viewing angle increases . in the following , we consider two observation bands : the lower energy band @xmath95 , and the higher energy band @xmath96 .",
    "the maximum frequency @xmath91 is larger than the highest observed energy @xmath97 ( @xmath98 in the present case ) when @xmath99 . in this case",
    ", we observe the low energy part of the band spectrum in equation ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) .",
    "since the low energy power law index is @xmath69 , the peak flux ratio @xmath100 and the fluence ratio @xmath101 are given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , when the maximum frequency @xmath91 is smaller than the lowest observed energy @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath105 , the peak flux ratio and the fluence ratio are given by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 .",
    "we compare figure  [ fig : ratio ] with observations . observed peak flux ratios extend up to a factor of 100 and observed fluence ratios extend up to a factor of 20 ( fig .  3 of heise et al .",
    "one can see that when @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 agree with the observational data . furthermore , kippen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported that @xmath91 ranges between about @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "for our parameters , this can be reproduced if the viewing angle satisfies @xmath112 .",
    "we calculate the peak flux and the photon index in the energy band @xmath6 as a function of the viewing angle @xmath75 , and plot it in the peak flux @xmath113 photon index plane .",
    "figure 3 show the results for @xmath114 .",
    "the distance is varied from @xmath115 gpc to @xmath116 gpc for our parameters . ,",
    "@xmath117 and @xmath118 ) , @xmath119 corresponds to @xmath120 .",
    "this does not affect our argument qualitatively , but alters the quantitative results up to a factor of 2 .",
    "] one can see that the photon index increases and the peak flux decreases as the viewing angle @xmath75 increases .    as discussed in   [ sec : ratio ] , we observe the low- ( high- ) energy part of the band spectrum in equation ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) when @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , where @xmath123 and @xmath104 . therefore , the photon index in the energy range @xmath6 is nearly equal to the low- ( high- ) energy spectral index @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) when @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) . with the analytical estimates in the appendix",
    ", we can also find that the peak flux @xmath128 is approximately given by @xmath129^{-2+\\alpha_b } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left(\\frac{r_0/c\\beta \\gamma^2}{10\\,{\\rm s}}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\gamma",

    "[ [ eq : fpeak ] ] can be applied to larger viewing angles @xmath131 .",
    "we have confirmed that numerical results can be fitted within 5% errors ) . the peak flux @xmath128 is smaller for larger viewing angle .",
    "however , if the distances to such sources are small , @xmath128 may be comparable to that of the typical grbs , which have large distances and small viewing angles .    for comparison , we also plot the observed data in the same figures ( fig .  2 of heise et al .",
    "one can see that the observed xrfs take place within @xmath132 and have a viewing angle @xmath133 .",
    "we roughly estimate the limits in flux sensitivity of the detectors . on the right - hand side of the oblique dashed line ,",
    "the peak flux in the @xmath0-ray band @xmath134 is larger than the limiting sensitivity of the grbm ( @xmath135 ) , and such events are observed as grbs , not as xrfs .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents the sensitivity of wfcs , where we assume the integration time of @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , the observed data of xrfs sit in a fairly narrow region surrounded by two dashed lines .",
    "the distance to the farthest xrf @xmath137 gives the observed event rate of the xrfs .",
    "the observed event rate @xmath138 can be estimated as @xmath139 , where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the event rate of the grbs and the number density of galaxies , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) is the solid angle subtended by the direction to which the source is observed as the xrf ( grb ) . from previous discussions",
    ", one can find that the emitting thin shell with opening half - angle @xmath38 is observed as the xrf ( grb ) when the viewing angle is within @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "therefore the ratio of each solid angle is estimated as @xmath146 . using this value",
    ", we obtain @xmath147 which is comparable to the observation .",
    "we have shown that the observed data of the xrfs can be reproduced by a simple jet model of the grbs .",
    "this suggests that the xrfs are identical to grbs .",
    "we may say that in the context of our model , nearby grbs are observed as xrfs when we see them from the off - axis viewing angle .",
    "if the distance to the xrfs is much larger than a few gpc , they can not be observed since the observed flux is low .",
    "this is consistent with the observed value of @xmath148 since the nearby sources distribute homogeneously in euclidean space .",
    "our view of the xrfs is different from that of heise et al .",
    "they have proposed that xrfs could be grbs at large redshift @xmath22 , when @xmath0-rays would be shifted into the x - ray range . however , the observed total duration @xmath149 can not be explained . in our model , @xmath0-rays are shifted into the x - ray range by the relativistic beaming effect .",
    "the total duration is equal to the lifetime of the central engine and thus does not depend on the viewing angle @xmath23 .",
    "hence the total duration of the xrfs may be similar to that of the grbs in our model .",
    "we can calculate @xmath150 , the observed duration of a single pulse in the x - ray band ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "when the viewing angle ranges from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , the pulse duration is about @xmath153 $ ] .",
    "this value is comparable but a little bit inconsistent with the observation since the observed pulse duration @xmath150 , which is the order of the angular spreading timescale , should be less than the total duration @xmath154 , which is the time interval between the first and the last emission .",
    "this contradiction can be resolved as follows .",
    "so far , we have assumed the isotropic energy of the instantaneous emission @xmath155 and the time unit @xmath156 .",
    "the effect of changing the values of these two parameters appears only in the flux normalization @xmath157 in equation ( [ eq : jetthin ] ) .",
    "however , one can see that from equation ( [ azero ] ) , if one rescales these parameters as @xmath158 and @xmath159 , the flux normalization factor is invariant @xmath160'$ ] , which implies that the result is unchanged .",
    "the value of @xmath161 is the number of instantaneous emissions , since we fix the total emission energy as @xmath162 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath163 , @xmath150 of each emission can be less than @xmath149 .",
    "ioka & nakamura ( 2001 ) showed that the variability of grbs is small for large viewing angle .",
    "in addition , our model predicts that the number of pulses of the xrfs is smaller than that of typical grbs .",
    "this can be expected from the following discussions . in this letter",
    ", we consider the time - averaged emissions , which means that successive emissions from multiple subjets with the opening half - angle @xmath164 are approximated by one spontaneous emission caused by a single jet with the viewing angle @xmath23 and the opening half - angle @xmath38 .",
    "let the viewing angle of each subjet to be @xmath165 .",
    "the observed flux ( or fluence ) in the x - ray band due to the subjets with @xmath166 are much smaller than that with @xmath167 , and hence negligible .",
    "we have confirmed this in the practical calculation . if @xmath168 , the emissions of subjets with @xmath167 dominates , while if @xmath169 , in the grb case , the emissions from almost all subjets may be detected .",
