    "during a systematic search of the galactic globular cluster ( gc ) system for millisecond pulsars ( msps ) carried out with the parkes radio telescope , damico et al .",
    "( 2001a ) discovered the binary millisecond pulsar , in the nearby globular cluster ngc 6397 .",
    "the pulsar displays eclipses at a frequency of 1.4 ghz for more than 40% of the @xmath7",
    "hr orbital period and exhibits striking irregularities of the radio signal at all orbital phases .",
    "these features indicate that the msp is orbiting within a large envelope of matter released from the companion ( damico et al .",
    "2001b ) , whose interaction with the pulsar wind could be responsible for the modulated and probably extended x - ray emission detected with _",
    "( grindlay et al . 2001 , 2002 ) . by using the position of the msp inferred from radio timing , ferraro et al . (",
    "2001 ) identified a variable star ( _ star a _ , hereafter com  j1740@xmath85340 ) whose optical modulation nicely agrees with the orbital period of the msp .",
    "in particular , ferraro et al . noticed that is the first example of a msp companion whose light curve is dominated by ellipsoidal variations , suggestive of a tidally distorted star , which almost completely fills ( and is still overflowing ) its roche lobe .",
    "binary evolution calculations ( e.g. tauris & savonije 1999 ; podsiadlowski , rappaport & pfahl 2002 ) and the few optical detections ( e.g. hansen & phinney 1998 ; stappers et al .",
    "2001 ) show that the common companion to a binary msp is either a white dwarf or a very light ( @xmath9 ) almost completely exhausted ( and perhaps evaporating ) star .",
    "if a msp is located in a gc , dynamical encounters in the cluster core can also provide it with other kinds of companion and in fact a main sequence star has been probably identified as the star orbiting the msp 47tuc - w in 47 tucanae ( edmonds et al .",
    "none of these hypotheses can be applied to @xmath10 it is too luminous to be a white dwarf ( v@xmath11 , comparable to the turn - off stars of ngc  6397 ) ; its mass ( @xmath12 for a @xmath13 neutron star , damico et al .",
    "2001a ) is not compatible with that of a very light stellar companion ; its anomalous red color would require it to be perturbed if it was originally on the main sequence .",
    "as a consequence , a wealth of intriguing scenarios have flourished in order to explain the nature of the binary ( see possenti 2002 , orosz & van kerkwijk 2003 , grindlay et al .",
    "2002 for a review ) .    in any model , must have undergone at least one and perhaps multiple phases of `` recycling '' ( alpar et al .",
    "1982 ) . during this process significant accretion of mass ( @xmath14 ) onto the neutron star ( ns )",
    "is expected ( van den heuvel & bitzaraki 1995 ; burderi et al .",
    "1999 ) , but up to now no observation has measured a msp ns mass unambiguously outside the narrow range of masses ( average @xmath15 ) measured by thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1999 ) in a sample of binary pulsars statistically dominated by ns - ns relativistic systems . besides clarifying the spin - up mechanism , finding a more massive ns could shed light also on the equation of state for nuclear matter ( e.g. cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ) .",
    "interestingly , and its companion constitute the optically brightest dual - line binary hosting a msp , thus being a prime target for an accurate determination of both the binary parameters and the mass of a spun - up pulsar , while yielding the possibility of discriminating between the different suggested evolutionary paths .",
    "hence , we have planned a coordinated spectro - photometric campaign using the eso telescopes in la silla and paranal ( both in chile ) .",
    "while the photometric survey is still in progress , we present in this _ letter _ the first spectroscopic results of the project , based on the analysis of a set of phase - resolved high - resolution spectra . here",
    "we present the radial velocity curve of com  j1740@xmath85340 , the mass ratio of the system and preliminary estimates of its metallicity and effective temperature . the detailed analysis of the chemical abundance pattern of will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( sabbi et al 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "the observations were performed in service mode with the _ ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph _ ( uves ) mounted at the _ kueyen _ 8m - telescope ( ut2 ) of the eso very large telescope on cerro paranal ( chile ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained on 8 different nights from 2002 may to 2002 june ( see table [ t : mjd ] ) in order to cover the complete orbital period of the system .",
    "the dichroic beamsplitter # 1 together with grisms # 2 ( centered at @xmath16 ) and # 3 ( centered at @xmath17 ) were used : this configuration allowed us to observe simultaneously two spectral ranges with the two arms ( blue and red ) of the spectrograph , covering the wavelength ranges @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "a 1  wide and 8  long slit was adopted , yielding a resolution of @xmath21 at order centers .",
    "the exposure time for each spectrum ( @xmath22 sec , equal to @xmath23% of the system orbital period ) enabled us to perform accurate phase resolved analysis , with a typical signal - to - noise ratio @xmath24 per pixel , measured at the continuum level .",
    "all the spectra were extracted with the uves pipeline ( ballester et al .",
    "the broad spectral range covered by the spectra allows the observation of a large number of spectral features .",
    "in particular we selected a set of @xmath25 lines ( comprising fei , cai , nai , mgi , mni , tii and h@xmath26 ) not contaminated by atmospheric and/or interstellar contributions . the doppler - shifted wavelength of each line has been measured : the resolution of the uves spectra allows very accurate measures of line centroids , with a typical formal accuracy of @xmath27 (@xmath28 km s@xmath29 ) .",
    "we have verified that the broadening of each line due to the variation of the velocity of the source along a 2600-sec integration is always negligible with respect to the intrinsic width of the lines .",
    "the line broadening due to rotation ( @xmath30 km s@xmath29 ) permitted rejection of contaminating lines coming from nearby , non rotating objects ( the system is in a crowded region , see fig .  1 of ferraro et al .",
    "the wavelength of each line has been converted to radial velocity ( rv ) , taking into account for the heliocentric correction . in order to minimize spurious effects we measured rvs independently on the red and blue part of each spectrum and carefully checked that no significant offset was present .",
    "then , all the rv measures obtained in each spectrum were averaged and a mean value was obtained .    in order to determine the amplitude @xmath31 of the rv curve and the systemic velocity @xmath32 , we fitted the data using the sum of a constant and a sinusoidal function , which is adequate to describe the orbital motion of this almost circular system ( eccentricity @xmath33 ; damico et al .",
    "the best fit yields a radial - velocity amplitude @xmath34 km s@xmath29 ( @xmath35-error ) with @xmath36 .",
    "inspection of figure [ vcurve ] shows that the absolute phase of the rv data matches that of the radio pulsar orbital motion very well ( the radial velocities are null at inferior and superior conjunctions which , according to the convention of damico et al . 2001b ,",
    "correspond to orbital phases 0.25 and 0.75 respectively ) , confirming unambiguously that and orbit each other .",
    "the systemic velocity is @xmath37 km s@xmath29 , which is in perfect agreement with the radial motion of the cluster ( @xmath38 km s@xmath29 ; harris 1996 ) , further confirming the membership",
    ". km s@xmath29",
    "( @xmath35 limit ) suggests that the center of mass of the binary is now near apoastron of a highly elliptical orbit in the globular cluster .",
    "in fact , were the binary on an almost circular orbit at 11 core radii from the gc center , its relative line of sight velocity ( estimated from the enclosed mass ) would be of the order @xmath39 km s@xmath40 this result supports the hypothesis that the binary has been recently kicked out of the core of ngc 6397 due the a dynamical interaction ] table [ t : mjd ] lists the final heliocentric velocities after subtraction of the @xmath32 velocity , where the standard deviation of the average has been assumed as an estimate of the error .",
    "the epoch and the orbital phase of the mid - time of each observation are also reported .",
    "the latter has been computed using the radio ephemeris of ( damico et al .",
    "the resulting radial velocity - curve is shown in figure  [ vcurve ] .",
    "being a dual - line binary pulsar with a very bright companion , this system can be used to infer tight constraints to the masses of the components . the mass function @xmath41 of",
    "can be easily computed from the radial velocity amplitude @xmath31 and the orbital period @xmath42 days ( damico et al .",
    "2001b ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the masses of the pulsar and the companion star , @xmath46 is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line - of - sight and the errors are quoted at the @xmath35-level , as everywhere in the following .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath47 can be derived by combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfcom ] ) with the mass function of the msp obtained by damico et al .",
    "( 2001b ) : @xmath48 we obtain @xmath49 , which is the most accurate estimate ( @xmath50% error ) ever obtained for the mass ratio in any non - relativistic binary comprising a neutron star and in particular a recycled pulsar . in order to completely solve for the binary parameters one needs the orbital inclination of the system .",
    "however , for a reasonable choice of the neutron star mass ( in the range @xmath51 , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , the precise measurement of the mass ratio reduces the allowed space of the parameters to a very narrow strip in the @xmath44 vs. @xmath46 diagram ( see fig .  [ mvsm ] ) .",
    "a further constraint on the inclination can be inferred from the ellipsoidal modulation of the light curves of ( the ongoing photometric analysis will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "preliminary results , based on an incomplete coverage of the orbit ( orosz & van kerkwijk 2003 ) indicate @xmath52 ( at @xmath53 ) which implies ( fig . [ mvsm ] ) @xmath54 .",
    "this lower limit on @xmath46 well agrees with that ( @xmath55 ) derived from our determination of the rotational velocity @xmath56 of assuming a photometric radius of the companion in the range ( @xmath57 ) measured by orosz & van kerkwijk ( 2003 ) .    hence in table",
    "[ t : par ] , we have listed some of the orbital parameters of the system derived assuming the three reference cases of @xmath58 . in all these cases , the radius of the roche lobe of matches with the dimension estimated from hst photometry ( ferraro et al .",
    "the implied range of the companion masses ( @xmath59 ) fits all the evolutionary models proposed so far ( burderi , dantona & burgay 2002 ; orosz & van kerwijk 2003 ; grindlay et .",
    "al 2002 ; ergma & sarna 2003 ) , whose discrimination will be greatly assisted by the detailed measurement of the chemical abundances ( sabbi et al 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "in order to perform a preliminary chemical abundance analysis , the two spectra taken under the best seeing conditions ( at phases 0.021 and 0.564 , close to the quadratures , see table [ t : mjd ] ) have been corrected for the rv and then combined , thus attaining @xmath60 in the wavelength region around 5900   , near the nai d lines .",
    "the estimate of the metallicity has been obtained inspecting the equivalent width of about 40 useful lines ( mostly fei ) and by assuming a gravity ( log @xmath61 ) compatible with the position of in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "figure [ he ] shows a zoom - in on that spectral region of the normalized spectrum taken at phase 0.02 .    in summary ,",
    "the main features of the spectra are : ( 1 ) strong broadening of the lines due to the rotation of the star ; ( 2 ) a low value of the metallicity @xmath62}\\sim -2 $ ] and an excess of @xmath63-elements such as nai , mgi , and sii ; ( 3 ) the presence of many lines of low excitation , together with a few weak lines of ionized elements .",
    "feature ( 2 ) is fully compatible with the results derived for other stars in this cluster ( gratton et al .",
    "2001 ) , and further confirms the membership of the object to ngc 6397 . feature ( 3 ) indicates that the effective temperature is low , in agreement with the red color of the source .",
    "the @xmath64 line wings imply @xmath65 k , confirming the previous estimate of ferraro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    the most fascinating result of the preliminary abundance analysis is the presence of hei absorption lines at 5875.6    and at 6678.2  .",
    "the former line is clearly visible in figure [ he ] .",
    "such a spectral feature is completely unexpected in a low - temperature star like com  j1740@xmath85340 , being the signature of photospheric regions at @xmath6k .",
    "remarkably , the hei lines are clearly visible in all the spectra , with the exception of the two taken at phases 0.199 and 0.363 , when is located between the msp and the observer .",
    "this result suggests the existence of a region of the star ( facing the pulsar ) at a temperature significantly larger than the rest of the surface .",
    "more careful analyses are under way to assess the dimensions of the heated region . however , the relatively small orbital variation of the colors ( hence effective temperature ) of the star ( orosz & van kerkwijk 2003 , kaluzny , rucinski , & thompson .",
    "2002 ) is suggestive of a heated area , smaller than the cross section of the surface of visible from the msp . at the same time",
    ", the rotation profile of the hei lines would suggest that this warmed region extends rather longitudinally along the companion surface ( an equatorial strip ? ) .",
    "as an example , a region facing the pulsar with a dimension @xmath66% of the roche lobe radius of and with @xmath67 k , could produce a brightening of 0.020.04 mag in the light curves of near orbital phase 0.75 ( when we see the hemisphere of the companion facing the pulsar ) .",
    "this could explain the asymmetry in the light curves seen around the minimum at phase 0.75 ( ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the existence of a strongly heated portion of the surface of a msp companion is not uncommon ( e.g. stappers et al . 2001 ) and naturally calls for the effects of the energetic flux of particles and electromagnetic waves released from the msp .",
    "what is peculiar in is the strip - like shape and the equatorial location of the heated region .",
    "this would suggest that the pulsar energetic flux is preferentially emitted in the orbital plane of the binary with a highly flattened shape .",
    "noticeably , a similar planar emission pattern of the pulsar wind has been invoked in order to explain the origin of the x - ray inner ring surrounding the crab , whose spin axis is believed to be nearly orthogonal to the plane containing the ring ( hester et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in summary ,",
    "if confirmed by future analysis , the existence of a warmed strip onto the surface of would be of great significance : first , a strongly anisotropic emission could enhance the amount of the pulsar rotational energy impinging onto the companion .",
    "this could trigger yet largely unmodeled effects during the radiation - driven evolution of a msp binary system ( dantona 1996 ) .",
    "secondly , location and extension of the heated strip could be used for inferring the msp spin and magnetic axes orientations , helping in discriminating among the different evolutionary scenarios proposed so far .",
