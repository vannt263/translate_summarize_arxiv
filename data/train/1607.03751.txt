    "the large - scale time evolution of interfaces separating different thermodynamic phases is a classical subject in statistical mechanics .",
    "a first natural goal is that of obtaining a hydrodynamic limit @xcite : take an initial interface configuration that approximates a macroscopic smooth profile , let it evolve via a microscopic markovian glauber - type dynamics that , at the lattice level , evolves via simple local rules and , rescaling time and space properly , prove that the interface converges to the solution of a deterministic pde .",
    "if the two thermodynamic phases separated by the interface are at coexistence , i.e. if they have the same bulk free energy , we expect the correct time rescaling to be diffusive and the limit equation to be a parabolic pde , in general a non - linear one , of the form @xmath4}{\\delta \\phi(x , t)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath5 $ ] is the surface tension functional , that is a purely equilibrium quantity , while @xmath6 is the ( in general slope - dependent ) interface mobility coefficient , that depends on the generator of the markov chain .    to obtain a mathematically simpler model , the interface is often described at the microscopic level by a @xmath7-dimensional height function ( `` effective interface '' ) , i.e. the graph of a function from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( or to @xmath10 in the case of discrete interface models ) . here , @xmath7 is the dimension of space where the thermodynamic system of interest lives and of course the physically most relevant case is @xmath11 . in the `` effective interface '' approximation ,",
    "the internal structure of the two bulk phases is forgotten and the occurrence of interface overhangs is entirely neglected . despite this somewhat drastic simplification , and despite the fact that the phenomenological picture behind the expected hydrodynamic limit is rather clear @xcite , most effective interface dynamics remain mathematically intractable and rigorous progress is very limited , especially for @xmath12 .",
    "one notable exception is that of the langevin dynamics for the ginzburg - landau model with symmetric and strictly convex potential , where a rigorous derivation of the hydrodynamic limit was obtained for any @xmath13 by funaki and spohn @xcite ( see also @xcite who extended @xcite beyond the case of periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "leaving aside the problem of rigorously proving the hydrodynamic limit , even the more modest goal of guessing the exact form of the limit pde is in general out of reach , except for lucky exceptions ( the ginzburg - landau model being one of them ) where the dynamics satisfies some form of `` gradient condition '' @xcite which allows to obtain a simple formula for the interface mobility @xmath14 , involving only equal - time equilibrium averages .",
    "the goal of the present work is to present a markov chain for a discrete interface model in dimension @xmath15 and to show that it should admit a hydrodynamic limit that is fully explicit and non - trivial ( @xmath16 is a non - linear function of the interface slope ) .",
    "we comment below on what is missing in order to turn our arguments into a rigorous proof .    before introducing the interface dynamics we are interested in",
    ", we make a brief detour to motivate the reader .",
    "a class of discrete interface dynamics that attracted much attention lately are glauber dynamics of dimer models , in particular lozenge tilings of the plane @xcite .",
    "such tilings are in bijection with @xmath15-dimensional discrete surfaces obtained as a monotone stacking of elementary cubes in @xmath17 , see figure [ fig : cubi ] .",
    "plane , note that the height of columns ( each with a blue lozenge on top ) is weakly decreasing in both @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions.,width=264 ]    here , `` monotone '' means that the heights of columns of cubes , indexed by the coordinates @xmath20 of their orthogonal projection on the horizontal plane , are weakly decreasing both w.r.t .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the most natural reversible markov dynamics on such tilings is the one whose elementary moves are rotations by an angle @xmath21 ( with transition rate @xmath22 ) of three lozenges sharing a common vertex , see figure [ fig : flip ] .",
    ".,width=188 ]    this will be called the `` single - flip dynamics '' in the following .",
    "as discussed for instance in @xcite , the single - flip dynamics coincides with the zero - temperature glauber dynamics of @xmath23 spin interfaces of the three - dimensional ising model with zero magnetic field , where spins flip one by one . in terms of monotone stacking of cubes , the dynamics corresponds to adding / removing a cube to / from a column , with transition rate @xmath22 , provided the cube stacking remains monotone after the update .",
    "recently it was proven that , if we restrict the single - flip dynamics to domains of diameter @xmath24 , under certain restrictions on the domain shape the mixing time is of order @xmath25 as @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these results support the idea that the correct time - scale to observe a hydrodynamic limit should be diffusive ( i.e. that we should rescale time by @xmath27 to see a macroscopic evolution ) but they are far from being enough for proving convergence to a limit pde .    in the present work , we study two modifications of the single - flip dynamics , where one allows a number @xmath28 cubes to be added / removed from a column in each move , again subject to the constraint that the update is legal ( i.e. that the resulting configuration is still a monotone stacking of cubes ) .",
    "if the rates are carefully chosen as functions of @xmath0 , the dynamics enjoys much nicer properties than the single - flip one .",
    "the first dynamics we will consider is the one where the transition rate of a legal update involving the addition / removal of @xmath0 cubes is proportional to @xmath1 ; in the second dynamics , instead , with rate @xmath22 the height of each column of cubes is resampled from the uniform distribution on all the allowed values it can take given the height of neighboring columns . see definitions [ def1 ] and [ def2 ] below for more details .",
    "the former dynamics was originally introduced in @xcite , and the latter in @xcite . both are known to satisfy the special property that the volume difference between two configuration is ( on average ) decreasing with time , which allows to deduce that the mixing time is at most polynomial in @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was proven in @xcite that the inverse spectral gap of the dynamics is @xmath29 and that , in special domains , a certain one - dimensional projection of the height function satisfies on average the one - dimensional discrete heat equation .    here",
    "we show that , under a reasonable but unproven assumption of local equilibrium , one can obtain the explicit form of the hydrodynamic limit equation for the height function , see eqs . , and below .",
    "actually , the hydrodynamic equation turns out to be the same for both variants of the dynamics .",
    "obtaining such an explicit expression for the hydrodynamic equation is a somewhat surprising fact ; indeed , let us stress that in general ( for instance , for the single - flip dynamics ) the assumption of local equilibrium is _ not _ sufficient to guess the limit equation : knowledge of _ corrections _ to local equilibrium is also necessary . there is a general heuristic formula @xcite for the mobility coefficient @xmath30 which is a variant of green - kubo formula .",
    "it involves the sum of two terms , one involving only local averages in the stationary state of slope @xmath31 and the second involving a time - integral of time - space correlations in the stationary state .",
    "the latter term can not in general be computed as it would require a closed form for space - time correlations .",
    "however in lucky cases ( like ours , see section [ sec : gk ] ) this term happens to be zero due to a summation by part at the discrete level .",
    "as we already mentioned , our derivation of the hydrodynamic limit relies on an unproven assumption of local equilibrium .",
    "there are various difficulties in proving such assumption , and the direct application of standard entropy techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) seems out of question , in particular because the stationary measures of the model exhibit long - range correlations .",
    "the adaptation of the so - called @xmath32 method employed in @xcite looks also challenging : technically the greatest difficulty is to get some @xmath33 control of interface gradients during the evolution ( see remark [ rem : tec ] below for more details ) . in @xcite",
    "an important role in this respect was played by strict convexity of the potential , that fails in our case .",
    "we plan to come back to this issue in subsequent work .",
    "the hydrodynamic equation has nice analytic features . while it is _ not _ in the form of a the gradient flow with respect of a surface free energy functional ,",
    "it can be written in a divergence form ( cf . ) that allows to show ( see section [ sec : l2 ] ) that the @xmath2 distance between solutions contracts with time .",
    "we believe this will be an important point in the program of rigorously proving the convergence towards the hydrodynamic limit equation .",
    "the analogous statement for the ginzburg - landau model was certainly a crucial ingredient in @xcite , because the @xmath32 method is all about controlling the time derivative of the @xmath2 distance between the deterministic pde and the randomly evolving interface , and one can hardly hope to achieve that without controlling the @xmath2 distance between deterministic solutions .",
    "we will also show that the @xmath34 distance between solutions of the limit pde is non - increasing , and decreases only by a boundary term ( section [ sec : l1 ] ) .",
    "this is the analogue of the above - mentioned average volume - contraction property of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "finally let us point out that the exact formula for the hydrodynamic equation leads to some striking identities involving the surface tension , see notably eq . and the discussion in remark [ rem : esotica ] , for which it would be very interesting to find a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce precisely the model and the dynamics .",
    "the hydrodynamic equation is given ( in two different but equivalent forms ) in section [ sec:3 ] , where we also discuss some of its properties , notably volume contraction . in section [ sec : gk ] we give a first justification for the limit equation , based on linear response theory . in section [ sec : le ] instead we derive the hydrodynamic equation under a local equilibrium assumption .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : k ] we explain how to perform some useful equilibrium computations .",
    "we start by defining discrete monotone surfaces .",
    "let @xmath35 be the collection of closed squares in @xmath17 of side @xmath22 , with the four vertices in @xmath36 .",
    "a discrete ( or stepped ) monotone surface @xmath37 is a connected union of elements of @xmath35 that projects bijectively on the @xmath38 plane ( the linear subspace of @xmath17 of normal vector @xmath39 ) .",
    "the @xmath38 orthogonal projection ( denoted @xmath40 ) of a square face of @xmath37 is a lozenge with angles @xmath41 and @xmath42 , side - length @xmath43 and three possible orientations : north - west , north - east and horizontal , according to whether the normal vector to the square face in question is @xmath44 , @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "the projection of @xmath37 gives therefore a lozenge tiling of @xmath38 .",
    "vertices of the lozenges are the vertices of a triangular lattice @xmath47 of side @xmath43 .",
    "we will refer to north - west oriented , north - east oriented and horizontal lozenges as lozenges of types @xmath48 respectively .",

    "of course @xmath70 since we imposed @xmath71 .",
    "the reason for the minus sign is that otherwise the interface gradients would be given by minus the lozenge densities ( see remark [ rem : gradienti ] just below ) , which would lead to less readable formulas later .",
