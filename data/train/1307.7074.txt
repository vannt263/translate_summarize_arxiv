    "x - ray emission from massive stars continues to demonstrate its importance for understanding these objects ( e.g. , gdel & naz 2009 ) . in particular ,",
    "x - ray generation can be associated with nonthermal processes , like particle acceleration , or with irreversible thermal processes , like shocked flows .",
    "the hypersonic laboratory afforded us by these winds could yield any of these emission types , depending on the nature of the winds and the phenomena they support .",
    "thus the observed x - rays give us a unique window into the processes that ultimately energize the interstellar medium and mediate galactic evolution ( e.g. , leitherer  2010 ) .",
    "previously known mechanisms for generating x - rays from the winds of massive stars include collisions in binary systems ( e.g. , usov 1992 ; stevens , blondin , & pollock 1992 ; canto , raga , & wilkin 1996 ; walder & folini 2000 ; parkin & pittard 2008 ; gayley 2009 ) , shock production in magnetically confined wind streams ( babel & montmerle 1997 ; townsend , owocki , & ud - doula 2007 ; li  2008 ; oskinova  2011 ; petit 2013 ; ignace , oskinova , & massa 2013 ) , and time - dependent shocks arising from inherent instabilities in line - driven winds ( lucy & white 1980 ; lucy 1982 ; owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ; feldmeier , puls , & pauldrach 1997 ; dessart & owocki 2003 ) .",
    "the latter two mechanisms arise in single stars , and came as a surprise when they were originally detected ( seward  1979 ; harnden  1979 ) .",
    "the shocks from the line - driven instability ( ldi ) are expected to be somewhat weaker , perhaps in the characteristic temperature range @xmath0  kev , than the strong shocks from magnetically confined winds .",
    "however , it should be noted that both of these mechanisms operate relatively close to the star , as line driving occurs where the wind is accelerating and magnetic channeling requires strong fields . in this paper , we will comment on x - ray generation that is inferred to originate well beyond the acceleration zone of the wind .",
    "we note that in the roughly four decades since the discovery of x - rays from massive stars , the quality of the information has increased markedly .",
    "modern x - ray observatories like the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ telescopes have larger collecting area and better spectral resolution than ever before ( e.g. , jansen  2001 ; weisskopf  2002 ) .",
    "stellar winds are an example of an area that have been significantly impacted by these observational advances in the x - ray band .",
    "the target discussed here is a member of the class of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , a relatively rare type of massive star . although rare , the wr  stars command significant attention by virtue of their extreme winds and evolved states .",
    "a topic of particular interest has been the production of x - ray emissions in the winds of single massive stars , like our source wr  6 ( also ez  cma and hd  50896 ) .",
    "here we present the second paper reporting on 439  ks of _ xmm - newton _ time . whereas the first report by oskinova  ( 2012 ; hereafter paper  i ) emphasized information content provided by _",
    "xmm - newton _ spectroscopy of wr  6 , here the focus is on understanding the star s wind structure through an analysis of the x - ray variability that it displays .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are generally accepted to be a phase of massive star evolution prior to termination as core - collapse supernova ( lamers  1991 ; langer 2012 ) .",
    "hydrogen is observed at much lower abundances than solar , or may even be altogether absent .",
    "the wr  stars come in three principal subgroups : nitrogen - rich , carbon - rich , and oxygen - rich , all of which are helium - rich .",
    "our target , wr  6 , is a wn4 star , indicating that it is an early - type star of the nitrogen - rich category ( hamann , koesterke , & wessolowski 1995 ; hamann , grfener , & liermann 2006 ) .",
    "the winds of wr stars are also expected to suffer from the ldi mechanism ( gayley & owocki 1995 ) and should thus emit x - rays similar to their o - type progenitors .",
    "however , the wr winds tend to be more massive than for o  stars .",
    "in general the two types of wind have similar wind terminal speeds , @xmath1 , in the 1,0003,000 km s@xmath2 range , but wr stars have wind mass - loss rates @xmath3 that are greater by up to an order of magnitude relative to o stars of similar luminosity . as a result",
    "the winds are far more dense than o  star winds ( e.g. , abbott  1986 ; bieging , abbott , & churchwell 1989 ) . the large wind densities and metallicity of wr winds make them quite opaque for the x - rays .",
    "the large wind opacity was invoked in oskinova  ( 2003 ) to explain the apparent lack of x - ray emitting single wc - type stars .",
    "perhaps the key result of the first paper is the measurement of resolved x - ray line profile shapes and properties that are consistent with x - ray emission that emerges from the wind at large radius ( of order @xmath4 in the wind , depending on the wavelength of observation ) .",
    "one evidence for this is the nominal @xmath5 ratios observed in he - like triplet species ( gabriel & jordan 1969 ; blumenthal , drake , & tucker 1972 ) . here",
    "`` f '' refers to the forbidden component and `` i '' the intercombination one .",
    "the ratio of fluxes in these emission lines is a diagnostic of pumping from the upper level of the `` i '' line to the `` f '' line . in the absence of such pumping",
    ", the ratio has a value predicted by intrinsic branching ratios ( e.g. , porquet  2001 ) , but the ratio can be reduced by either collisions or radiative excitation .",
    "the former is only important at high densities that are either not present in winds , or present only at depths from which x - rays may have a difficult time emerging , so is not considered here .",
    "radiative pumping is of more potentially ubiquitous importance in the uv - bright circumstellar environment of massive stars , and then the @xmath5 ratio becomes a diagnostic of the dilution of the stellar continuum , namely _ where _ in the wind x - ray emissions are formed ( waldron & cassinelli 2001 ; cassinelli  2001 ) .    for wr  6",
    "the @xmath5 ratios are close to their intrinsic and unpumped values , placing lower limits in the wind for the radius of the x - ray emission ( see paper  i ) .",
    "in addition , the line profiles are asymmetric in conformance with expectations for x - ray production that is distributed throughout , and substantially photoabsorbed by , a dense and metal - rich wr wind ( ignace 2001 ) .",
    "this stands in considerable contrast to o  star winds , where line profile shapes are often more symmetric in appearance , and @xmath5 ratios tend to show anomalous values that are consistent with uv pumping and therefore proximity of the hot x - ray emitting plasma to the stellar photospheres ( e.g. , waldron & cassinelli 2007 ) .",
    "although the high degree of photoabsorption from the dense wr  wind implies that observable emission would need to come from a large radius , possibly even @xmath6 stellar radii , the challenge for these results is to explain how any x - ray generating process in a single star could operate efficiently so far from the region where line driving and potentially strong magnetic fields could be present .",
    "in addition , wr  6 has a well - known `` clock '' in that it shows polarimetric and spectroscopic variability on a period of 3.766 days ( e.g. , firmani  1980 ) , yet no binary companion has been detected .",
    "moreover , the x - rays seem too soft and of too low a luminosity to be associated with a compact companion ( e.g. , morel , st - louis , & marchenko 1997 ) . based on the enhanced hardness of the emission in wr  6 compared to o  stars , skinner ( 2002 )",
    "have suggested that a low - mass non - degenerate companion might explain the x - rays .",
    "however , for a mass of @xmath7 and a radius @xmath8 , a 3.766  d period corresponds to a semi - major axis of only @xmath9 , which is about an order of magnitude smaller than the radius where optical depth unity is achieved by wind photoabsorption at 1  kev .",
    "perhaps some hard emission from a wind collision onto a companion could emerge owing to the fact that the photoabsorption opacity declines steeply with increasing photon energy , but certainly little or no soft emission would escape .",
    "also , the spectroscopic variability does not show the strict phase coherence from cycle to cycle that might be expected from a binary companion , but is consistent with a rotating star with stochastically varying features .",
    "given that the evidence so far favors a single - star hypothesis for wr  6 , this presents difficulties in accounting for the observed x - rays .",
    "theorists have appealed to large - scale clumping and porosity in stellar winds as a geometrical effect to allow for easier escape of x - ray photons ( feldmeier , oskinova , & hamann 2003 ; owocki & cohen 2006 ; oskinova , hamann , & feldmeier 2007 ; sundqvist 2012 ) .",
    "the evidence for clumping in massive star winds is certainly voluminous ( e.g. , hillier 1991 ; moffat & robert 1994 ; hamann & koesterke 1998 ) , and clumping ameliorates the x - ray emission - line profile asymmetries that result from smooth , non - clumped wind considerations .",
    "clumping on the smaller scale of the photon mean - free path , sometimes termed `` microclumping , '' provides no real help in terms of x - ray photon escape , because it serves only to enhance emissivity at fixed mass - loss rate .",
    "given that optically thin photoabsorption is linear in density , it scales the same as does the mass - loss rate itself , and is generally already included in mass - loss estimates .",
    "this paper reports on the analysis and interpretation of x - ray variability detected from wr  6 .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] provides a brief review of the dataset , which has been discussed more thoroughly in paper  i. section  [ sec : anal ] presents an analysis of the variability data , incorporating not only the recent _ xmm - newton _ pointings , but also all prior pointings from archival data . section  [ sec : model ] presents a discussion of the results in terms of potential causes , and explores the possibility of accounting for the observed variability in terms of a co - rotating interaction region ( cir ) model .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the x - ray data on wr6 were taken with the x - ray multi - mirror satellite xmm-_newton_. its telescopes illuminate three different instruments which always operate simultaneously : rgs is a reflection grating spectrometer , achieving a spectral resolution of 0.07 ; rgs is not sensitive for wavelengths shorter than 5 .",
    "the other focal instruments mos and pn cover the shorter wavelengths ; their spectral resolution is modest ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the data were obtained at four epochs in 2010 ( oct.11 and 13 , nov.4 and 6 ; see tab .  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the total exposure time of 439  ks was split into four individual parts .",
    "each exposure was approximately 30  hr in duration .",
    "the observations were not strongly affected by soft proton background flares .",
    "our data reduction involved standard procedures of the xmm-_newton _",
    "science analysis system v.10.0 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] displays the observed epic spectrum for the full exposure provided during the first of our four pointings .",
    "the three colors are for instruments pn , mos1 , and mos2 .",
    "spectral analysis was the focus of paper  i. here we explore the implications of observed variable x - ray emissions from wr  6 .    in order to display , analyze , and discuss the x - ray variability of wr  6 , we have evaluated spectrum - integrated count rates from the three epic instruments .",
    "given the stability of the epic - pn instrument , a combined count rate @xmath11 was determined from a simultaneous fit to the count rates in the three instruments assuming    @xmath12    where @xmath13 represents the median of a set of values in an observation .",
    "minimization techniques were used on image frames for the three independent detectors to obtain the best estimate of the combined count rate .",
    "background counts were modeled as well and treated independently among the instruments .",
    "the final count rate @xmath11 represents that value for the source that statistically produces the most consistent results for all three instruments . in this way signal - to - noise",
    "is maximized to produce the most sensitive possible study of variability in wr  6 from our dataset .    .xmm-_newton",
    "_  observations of wr6 [ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "a remarkable dataset of wr  6 was obtained by the _ xmm - newton _",
    "telescope , amounting to four pointings of approximately 100  ks each .",
    "the pointings came in the form of `` on '' and `` off '' exposures of two pairs of day - on , day - off , and day - on sequences , with the pairs separated by a few weeks .",
    "the high quality data provide a unique opportunity to probe the wind of wr  6 to understand better how its high energy emissions are produced and to understand the well - known 3.766  d variability period that has been observed in many other wavebands .",
    "the four pointings cover nearly all phases of the 3.766  d period , with some overlap as well .",
    "although variability is clearly evident , we were somewhat surprised to find that star s signature 3.766  d period is not obviously present in the observations .",
    "the dataset is of sufficient quality that we could conduct a search for `` event clustering '' in the arrival times of individual x - ray photons , but we fail to detect a signature of temporal clustering in the photon counts .",
    "the absence of such clustering would tend to favor either a tremendously large number of clumps or a stationary shock structure .",
    "the former would be consistent with the interpretation of variability seen in the o  star @xmath14  pup .",
    "the latter would be more consistent with a global wind structure .",
    "however , it seems physically quite challenging to understand how a stochastically structured wind , like that predicted by the ldi mechanism , could produce hot gas at large radii in the wind as implied by the spectral analysis of paper  i. in other words it is difficult to imagine how velocity differences of 100 s of km / s , required to produce x - rays at 1  kev energies , could exist at 100 s of stellar radii , well beyond the zone where the wind is accelerated to terminal velocity .",
    "discarding the embedded wind shock paradigm leaves the case of a stationary shock .",
    "the two most obvious candidates for such a structure would be a binary colliding wind interaction or a cir feature .",
    "we have argued against the binary hypothesis in favor of a cir structure .",
    "unfortunately , the large - scale coherence and evolution of a cir in the context of a wr  wind has not previously been investigated , and the nature of the x - ray production is unknown .",
    "consequently , we considered a simplistic kinematic model of a cir as a spiral feature that threads the wind , and we used scaling arguments to motivate a qualitative approach to the x - ray spectral energy distribution as a function of radius in the wind .",
    "our key motivation has been simply to explore the qualitative behavior of such a model .",
    "we find that a cir does provide features that could explain the observed variability in wr  6 .",
    "however , in order to accommodate the lack of precisely cyclical behavior in the x - ray light curve , a perturbation of the cir structure was invoked . specifically , we allowed for propagation of a wave along the length of the cir that served to modulate the opening angle ( and thus emission measure ) of the spiral structure .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine instabilities that might serve to drive such a result .",
    "certainly , the increasing evidence in support of cirs among wr  stars ( e.g. , st - louis  2009 ) indicates a need to explore the x - ray signatures that could result from such structures for wr  winds .",
    "we also recognize deficiencies in our model , such as implicitly treating the photoabsorbing opacity as a constant with radius whereas there is evidence to the contrary for massive star winds ( e.g. , oskinova  2006 ; herv  2012 ) .",
    "we suggest that the next step in understanding the x - ray processes in operation in wr  6 will require a long - term `` spot check '' monitoring program .",
    "x - ray count rates obtained at roughly weekly intervals over the course of about a year at a detection s / n of roughly 20 should be adequate to determine whether the x - rays vary at the 3.766  d period with an additional modulation like that indicated with our `` wavy cir '' model .",
    "the authors express appreciation to an anonymous referee for several useful suggestions .",
    "dph was supported by nasa through the smithsonian astrophysical observatory contract sv3 - 73016 for the chandra x - ray center and science instruments .",
    "funding for this research has been provided by dlr grant 50  or  1302 ( lmo ) .",
