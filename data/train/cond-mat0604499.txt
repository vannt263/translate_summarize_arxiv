    "traditionally , the forced dissociation rate of noncovalent biological receptor - ligand bonds is described by the simple bell expression  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the intrinsic rate constant in the absence of force , @xmath3 is the height of the intrinsic energy barrier , @xmath4 is a projection of the distance from the bound state to the energy barrier onto external applied force @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath7 is absolute temperature .",
    "bell phenomenologically introduced this expression from the kinetic theory of the strength of solids in his seminal paper more than twenty years ago .",
    "evans and ritchie  @xcite later put the bell expression onto a firm theoretical bases : the bond rupture was modelled in the framework of kramers theory as thermally assisted escape over one or several transition state barriers .",
    "the validity of the expression has been demonstrated in experiments  @xcite . in the bell",
    "forced dissociation rate model , the parameters including the energy barrier @xmath3 and the projection distance @xmath8 are deterministic and time independent .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have known that in a large variety of chemical and physical areas , association / dissociation processes could be stochastic and time dependent .",
    "such processes have been termed as  rate processes with dynamical disorder \" in an excellent review given by zwanzig  @xcite in fifteen years ago .",
    "the typical examples include cyclization of polymer chains in solutions  @xcite , ligands rebinding to heme proteins  @xcite , electron transfer reactions  @xcite , electronic relaxation in solutions in the absence of an activation barrier  @xcite , and etc .",
    "hence , in principle we could expect that dynamic disorder may also arise in some forced biological bond rupture experiments .",
    "but it was not until recently that we  @xcite firstly pointed that this disorder might play key role in a forced dissociation experiment of the adhesive bond forming between p - selectin and p - selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 ( psgl-1 ) using atomic force microscopy ( afm )  @xcite , though this experiment was published three years ago .",
    "a counterintuitive observation has been found : in contrast to ordinary biological bonds , the mean lifetimes of the psgl-1@xmath0p - selectin bond first increase with initial application of a small force , which were termed  catch \" by dembo  @xcite early , and subsequently decrease , which were termed  slip \" .",
    "the main point of the questions of dynamic disorder is that the rate coefficient depends on stochastic control variables and is fluctuating in time  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , we suggested that the bell parameters in eq .",
    "[ bellmodel ] were stochastic  @xcite .",
    "as one type of noncovalent bonds , interactions of adhesive receptor and their ligand is always weaker . moreover , the interface between them has been reported to be broad and shallow , such that revealed by the crystal structure of the psgl-1@xmath0p - selectin bond  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is plausible that the energy barriers @xmath9 or the projection distance @xmath8 for the bond are fluctuating with time due to either the global conformational change or the local conformational change at the interface .",
    "two possible cases were discussed . in the gaussian stochastic rate model ( gsrm )",
    "@xcite , we simply assumed that @xmath8 and @xmath9 had basic properties of random variables .",
    "we concluded that the catch behavior of some biological adhesive bonds could arise from the stronger positive correlation between the two stochastic variables .",
    "although the model accounted for the catch - slip bond transition in a direct and analytic way , it also predicted that the mean lifetime of the psgl-1@xmath0p - selectin bond was symmetric relative to a critical force @xmath10 , while the experimental data were clearly skewed towards a large force .",
    "in addition , the physical justice of the assumption of a stationary dissociation process may be doubtful . to overcome these shortages , we proposed an alternative and more  microscopic \" model  @xcite , in which external applied force not only presents in the bell expression , but also modulates the distribution of a  inner \" conformational coordinate .",
    "we named it as force modulating dynamic disorder ( fmdd ) model in the following .",
    "in contrast to the gsrm , we only allowed the energy barrier to be stochastic .",
    "the quantitative description was based on a one - dimension diffusion - reaction equation  @xcite .",
    "we found that agreement between our calculation and the data was impressive .",
    "this model also suggests a new physical explanation of the catch - slip bond : the transition could arise from a competition of the two components of applied force along the directions of the dissociation reaction coordinate and the complex conformational coordinate ; the former accelerates the dissociation by lowering the height of the energy barrier , i.e. , the slip behavior , while the later stabilizes the complex by dragging the system to the higher barrier height , i.e. , the catch behavior .",
    "even there are apparent advantages of the fmdd model , we can not completely exclude the gsrm , because compared to the former , the gsrm does not require that force acts on the  inner \" conformation coordinate .",
    "this requirement makes us to conclude that catch - slip bond transitions would be altered by the orientation of external forces  @xcite .",
    "although such a prediction has a potential to account for the bulk experimental observations  @xcite that the optimal binding of p - selectin is critically dependent on the relative orientations of its ligand , there is no such evidence in the existing data measured by the single molecular techniques  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have viewed the conformational coordinate to be molecular extension which is coupled to external applied force .",
    "we also have no strong experimental evidence to support this assumption .",
    "the inner coordinate has been thought to be experimentally unaccessible .",
    "in addition , the fmdd model did not investigate the possibility of a fluctuating projection distance . in the present work ,",
    "we try to give a model that force does not modulate the conformational coordinate of the complex while presenting catch - slip behaviors simultaneously .",
    "our model still bases on a diffusion - reaction equation .",
    "different from the fmdd model , the projective distance @xmath8 is allowed to be fluctuating and negative .",
    "our calculation shows that this new bell rate model with dynamic disorder not only derives the same expression of the mean lifetime which has been obtained in the gsrm before if both @xmath3 and @xmath8 are simple linear functions of the conformational coordinate , but also well fits to the experimental data if a slightly complicated piecewise function with two segments is used .",
    "an unexpected consequence of this model is that the transition from catch to slip converts into slip - catch transition when the conformational diffusion is  frozen \" by lowering the diffusion coefficient to zero .",
    "interestingly , the fmdd model does not predict such a conversion . therefore",
    ", our discussion here would be useful to design new experiments to distinguish which model is physically correct .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we describe the physical picture of the bell rate model with dynamic disorder and give the essential mathematic derivations . according to the value of the diffusion coefficient , we distinguish three cases : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the intermediate @xmath13 .",
    "analytical solutions can be obtained for the first two cases , while for the last one we resort to numerical approach . in the following section , we study two extended bell models at the three different coefficients , in which the barrier height and projection distance are linear and piecewise functions of the conformational coordinate , respectively . a comparison between model and the experiments is also performed .",
    "finally we give our conclusion in sec iv .",
    "the physical picture of our model for the forced dissociation of the receptor - ligand bonds is very similar with the small ligand binding to heme proteins  @xcite : there is a energy surface for the dissociation which dependents on both the dissociation reaction coordinate of the receptor - ligand bond and the conformational coordinate @xmath14 of complex , while the later is perpendicular to the former ; for each complex conformation @xmath14 there is a different dissociation rate constant which obeys the bell expression @xmath15 .",
    "higher temperature or larger diffusivity ( low viscosities ) allows @xmath14 variation within the complex to take place .",
    "conversely , at very low temperatures ( or high viscosities ) the coordinate is frozen so that the complex is ruptured with the rate constant @xmath15 without changing their @xmath14 value during dissociation .",
    "* the constant force mode .",
    "* there are two types of force loading modes .",
    "first we consider the constant force case  @xcite . a diffusion equation in the presence of a coordinate dependent reaction is given by  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability density for finding a value @xmath14 at time @xmath18 , at initial time @xmath19",

    "the motion is under influence of a potential @xmath20 and a coordinate dependent bell expression @xmath15 . because the above equation in fact is almost same with that proposed by agmon and hopfield except that the rate constant is controlled by applied force @xmath5 , we only present essential mathematic derivations .",
