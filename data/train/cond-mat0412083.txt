    "despite its long and venerable history , light propagation in disordered media continues to be a fascinating and intensely studied topic . in particular",
    ", the discovery of the coherent back scattering peak @xcite has triggered an intensive search for anderson localization @xcite of light .",
    "clearly , the unambiguous demonstration of anderson localization of electromagnetic radiation in an appropriate disordered dielectric medium in which dephasing and interaction effects can be neglected , would mark a major triumph of our current understanding of wave propagation .",
    "in fact , early works reported anomalously low values of the diffusion constant in strongly scattering suspensions @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized @xcite that these low values of the diffusion constant are associated with the resonant ( mie ) scattering of individual scatterers .",
    "this leads to a frequency - dependent dwell - time that has to be added to the time - of - flight between succesive scattering events . as a result",
    ", the energy transport velocity acquires a corresponding renormalization , while the transport mean free path remains essentially unchanged @xcite .",
    "similarly , an analysis of the coherent back scattering peak together with the dependence of the transmission through disordered semiconductor powders on the sample size , suggested a scaling behavior @xcite consistent with the onset of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "however , a reexamination of these data ignited a heated debate as to how to discriminate anderson localization from absorption effects @xcite .",
    "subsequent experiments on similarly strongly scattering semiconductor powders @xcite did not produce evidence of anderson localization and the experimental data could be well explained using a recently developed effective medium theory that incorporates the resonant scattering effects alluded to above @xcite .",
    "this unsatisfactory state of affairs has generated renewed interest in determining novel and unambiguous pathways to anderson localization of light .",
    "one class of highly interesting systems for multiple scattering of light are disordered dielectric media whose constituent materials exhibit one or more forms of optical anisotropies . moreover ,",
    "most optical anisotropies exhibit a certain degree of tunability through external control parameters , thus creating the possibility of a tunable disorder .",
    "for instance , faraday - activty in multiple scattering systems breaks the time reversal symmetry of maxwell s equations , leading to profound modifications of the coherent back scattering peak @xcite and in transport the optical analogue of the hall - effect has been observed @xcite . similarly , disordered nematic liquid crystals exhibit anisotropic coherent back scattering @xcite and anisotropic light diffusion @xcite .",
    "however , the strength of multiple scattering in bulk nematic liquid crystals is determined by the fluctuations of the nematic director field and the difference between the liquid crystal s ordinary and extraordinary index of refraction . for an observation of anderson localization of light in such systems",
    ", it will become necessary to enhance the multiple scattering effects , for instance , by infiltrating the nematic liquid crystal into the void regions of strongly scattering photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "equally intriguing is to combine the effects of multiple scattering of light with optical gain and to investigate how the two phenomena mutually influence each other . from the optical gain point of view , diffusing light will spend more time interacting with active material in a characteristic volume than ballistically propagating light . if this interaction time exceeds the ( spontaneous ) decay time of the active material , avalanche - like intensity bursts , induced by _",
    "incoherent _ feedback , could occur .",
    "in fact , early theoretical work @xcite suggested this very possibility and has recently been observed @xcite . from a wave propagation point of view",
    ", optical gain increases the relative weight of long trajectories in the sample and , therefore , will modify a number of wave interference effects such as coherent back scattering @xcite and possibly anderson localization .",
    "very recent experiments point to the possibility that such long trajectories provide a feedback mechanism which leads to modes with narrow laser - like emission lines that extend across the entire sample @xcite .",
    "however , the coherence properties of the emitted light still need to be analyzed in order to establish that laser action is indeed taking place in these systems .",
    "true laser action from localized regions in disordered dielectric samples with optical gain , termed random lasing , has been observed @xcite earlier , where measurements of the photon statistics of the emitted light @xcite have unambiguously demonstrated a _ coherent _ laser feedback mechanism .",
    "it has been discussed in the form of varying degrees of coupling between so - called quasi - states @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of multiple scattering in amplifying media , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "random lasing has potential applications ranging from micro - lasers and optical fingerprint markers @xcite to the detection of cancerous tissue @xcite .",
    "in addition , we want to note that recently , electrically pumped random laser action has been achieved in nd - doped powders @xcite , thus creating potential applications of these systems in omnidirectional lighting devices and displays .    despite these exciting developments ,",
    "a convincing connection between random lasing and anderson localization of light has not been demonstrated as of yet .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact , that to date the theory of random amplifying media either employs purely numerical methods in one spatial dimension @xcite or treats the multiple scattering part within certain approximation schemes that can not account for the interference effects that lead to anderson localization .",
    "these schemes include modeling the electromagnetic wave propagation through diffusion equations for the intensity @xcite or within the so - called ladder - approximation of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite . as a result ,",
    "it is unclear , whether anderson localization of light is a necessary condition for true random lasing ( coherent feedback ) nor whether the modified coherence properties in the lasing state have , in turn , an influence on the transition from the diffusion regime to the anderson localized regime itself .",
    "in fact , the very concept of describing the anderson localization transition in terms of a vanishing diffusion coefficient as an order parameter , familiar from systems with energy or particle number conservation , becomes questionable in dissipative or active media , where another channel for change of the energy density exists besides diffusion .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report our progress towards answering these questions .",
    "we develop a fully vectorial transport theory for multiple scattering of light in random media whose constituent materials are isotropic and exhibit linear absorption or gain . in section",
    "ii , we derive the tensorial kinetic equation for the intensity correlation function of electromagnetic radiation . the conservation of energy in media without loss or gain is incorporated in a field theoretical way by means of an exact ward identity ( wi ) , the effects of loss , gain as well as frequency dependence of the material parameters being represented by additional terms .",
    "the proof of this generalized wi is presented in section iii .",
    "subsequently , we solve the kinetic equation in the hydrodynamic limit by formulating , with the help of the wi , the continuity equation in section iv and fick s law in section v , respectively .",
    "these equations relate the energy density correlation tensor and the energy current correlation tensor to each other .",
    "they allow to identify , in the hydrodynamic limit , exact expressions for quantities like the energy transport velocity , the transport mean free path and the absorption / gain length in terms of the irreducible single - photon self - energy and the two - photon irreducible vertex .",
    "we recover the well - known mie scattering renormalization term to the transport velocity @xcite , albeit in vectorial form , along with additional , characteristic renormalizations originating from absorption or gain .",
    "section vi features numerical results for the energy velocity in dilute systems of spherical scatterers , where all quantities can be evaluated within the independent scattering approximation .",
    "the mie resonance dips in the energy transport velocity acquire a characteristic , absorption - induced broadening and gain - induced narrowing , which may be interpreted as due to the reduction ( enhancement ) of higher - order scattering contributions by absorption ( gain ) .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , our theory can be extended to systematically include wave interference effects ( `` cooperon '' contributions ) and , thus , to address the anderson localization transition by virtue of a self - consistent extension @xcite together with a replacement of the linear absorption / gain through a coupling to the master equation of the active medium @xcite .",
    "we consider the propagation of light in a system of randomly positioned scatterers with isotropic dielectric constant @xmath0 immersed in a host medium with isotropic dielectric constant @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we allow for the possibility of having absorption or amplification in both the scatterer material and the host medium by ascribing an imaginary part to the respective dielectric constants . by virtue of the kramers - kronig relations between real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant ,",
    "we are required to consider materials with complex frequency dependent dielectric constant @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting dielectric constant @xmath4 describes the arrangement of scatterers through the function @xmath5 which consists of a set of localized shape functions @xmath6 of the invididual scatterers at random locations @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding wave equation for a time harmonic wave with frequency @xmath8 and amplitude @xmath9 reads @xmath10 here , @xmath11 denotes the vacuum speed of light , and @xmath12 represents an excitation of the wave field through an external current source @xmath13 . the dielectric function @xmath14 carries a positive or negative imaginary part for absorbing or coherently amplifying media , respectively .    for a specific realization @xmath15 of disorder , the formal solution to eq .",

    "these divergencies are remedied by applying the regularization scheme familiar from quantum electrodynamics @xcite , i.e. by subtracting appropriate mass terms from the integrands such that after subtraction , these terms , and sufficiently many of their derivatives , do not diverge , thus making the integrals convergent .",
    "note that the corresponding regularization masses in general have to be determined numerically , since the prefactors of the ultraviolet divergencies are known numerically only .    in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to a discussion of the numerical results for the energy transport velocity tensor .",
    "we would like to point out that for isotropic dielectric materials , the energy transport velocity tensor becomes an isotropic tensor , so that we can further restrict our discussion to a single valued , frequency dependent energy velocity .    in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] , we display the frequency dependence of the energy transport velocity for a typical concentration of 6 % by volume of absorption - free scatterers with different ( real ) dielectric constants in an air background .",
    "clearly visible are the pronounced dips in the energy transport velocity near frequencies that correspond to the single scatterer mie resonances . as the dielectric constant increases ,",
    "the mie scattering becomes stronger and leads to correspondingly stronger renormalization of the energy transport velocity through the `` dwell time '' effect mentioned above .",
    "these data are , therefore , consistent with earlier results for scalar waves @xcite and vector waves @xcite .",

    "[ plot1a ] . near the mie resonances",
    ", this phase velocity may exhibit values that significantly exceed the vacuum speed of light . since the phase velocity in a random medium does not correspond to a physical quantity ,",
    "this behavior is not in conflict with the laws of relativity .    adding linear gain to the system ,",
    "dramatically modifies the situation . in fig .",
    "[ plot2 ] , we show the frequency dependence of the energy transport velocity for the weakest scattering system of fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] linear gain is added to the scatterer .",
    "although the concentration is only @xmath161 by volume , adding a relatively small negative imaginary part to the dielectric constant results in a significant narrowing of the energy transport velocity resonances .",
    "this gain narrowing may be understood by noting that the mie resonance dips in the transport velocity arise because of multiple reflection and interference of light within a single scatterer ( `` dwell time effect '' ) . in the presence of gain ,",
    "the relative importance of long wave paths for the interference processes is enhanced , leading to a narrowing of the resonance lines , analogous to the narrowing of the transmission lines in e fabry - perrot filter with increasing number of reflections .",
    "increasing the gain to rather unrealistic values shows further narrowing of the resonances together with a slight increase in the energy transport velocity .",
    "it should be noted that the energy transport velocity retains physical values for all values of the gain that we have considered .",
    "the opposite behavior occurs when we add linear absorption to the weakest scattering spheres of fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ plot3 ] , where we display the frequency dependence of the energy transport for increasing values of linear absorption in this system . in this case , the dips in the energy transport velocity that are associated with the mie resonances of the individual scatterers become washed out and disappear altogether for sufficiently large values of the linear absorption .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a microscopic approach to the calculation of transport quantities for electromagnetic waves propagating in disordered dielectric media which exhibit linear absorption or gain .",
    "the effects of energy conservation and of the violation of energy conservation in the presence of absorption or gain have been incorporated in the theory by means of an exact ward identity .",
    "the kinetic equation for light in random media with absorption or gain has been derived and solved for the energy density correlation tensor , taking fully into account the vectorial nature of electromagnetic radiation . in this way we have , to the best of our knowledge , for the first time derived explicit expressions for the energy transport velocity tensor , the diffusion tensor , the mean free path tensor , and the absorption length tensor in absorbing / emitting media .",
    "all these quantities experience renormalization due to scattering or impedence mismatch between host medium and scatterer material .",
    "specifically , we have discussed the case of a dilute system of identical spherical scatterers within the framework of the independent scatterer approximation .",
    "these systems exhibit considerable dips in the energy transport velocity that can directly be traced to a well - known `` dwell time '' effect .",
    "however , adding linear gain to the scatterers dramatically modifies this situation and significant gain narrowing occurs already for relatively modest values of the scatterers concentration and the imaginary part of their dielectric constant .",
    "we interpret this behavior as due to an increase of the relative importance of wave paths with long path lengths in the medium , and a subsequent , gain - induced enhancement of interference effects , analogous to the fabry - perrot effect .",
    "the opposite effect occurs when absorption is added to scatterers and the resonances in the energy transport velocity are washed out and ultimately disappear altogether . in all cases ,",
    "the energy transport velocity retains physical values , in contrast to the phase velocity .    as a systemiatic transport theory , expressing all physical quantities ultimately in terms of the single - photon selfenergy and the two - photon irreducible scattering vertex ,",
    "our approach may be generalized to include interference effects like weak or strong localization , e.g. in the spirit of the self - consistent theory of anderson localization that is well - known for electronic systems . together with a replacement of the linear gain by a direct coupling of transport equations to the semiclassical laser rate equations",
    "this may provide a microscopic theory for the interplay of optical gain and anderson localization of light .",
