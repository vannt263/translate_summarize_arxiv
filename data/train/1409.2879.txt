    "the large number of exoplanets detected thus far provides significant observational constraints for theoretical studies on planet formation and evolution .",
    "the population - wide distributions of these exoplanets are closely related to their formation history . based on the core accretion paradigm @xcite",
    ", we can generate synthetic planet populations that may explain the statistical characteristics of exoplanets , such as the planet s semi - major axis versus its mass ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) @xcite and its mass - radius diagram @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath1 mission detected thousands of planetary candidates , the radii of which were measured using transit observations @xcite .",
    "these data may provide an important clue to the size distribution of close - in planets @xcite , which is an essential test of the current planet formation theories .",
    "previous planetary population synthesis models by @xcite reproduced a synthetic planet population with a similar planet size distribution as observed in the @xmath1 data at radii @xmath4 2 @xmath0 .",
    "however , for planets with radii @xmath5 2 @xmath0 , a strong decrease in the synthetic planet population is inconsistent with the plateau in the planet size distribution of the @xmath1 data , after correction for observational bias @xcite .",
    "the divergence may be due to simplifications in the planetary population synthesis models @xcite . as a simplification , atmospheric evaporation",
    "after the protoplanetary disks have dissipated @xcite , which is important for close - in planets , was not considered in the former studies .",
    "nevertheless , atmospheric evaporation may play a vital role in the thermal evolution of low - mass planets ; this can alter the size distribution of close - in planets with radii @xmath5 2 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus in order to use the radius distribution of close - in exoplanets to constrain planet formation models which is our final goal , it is necessary to include the effect of atmospheric escape .    in the planetary evolution stage after disk dissipation , the atmospheric structure and thermal evolution of a close - in planet",
    "are strongly influenced by intense irradiation from the host star @xcite .",
    "moreover , the incident stellar x - ray and extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) flux can drive hydrodynamic evaporation in the atmosphere of close - in planets and yield a substantially higher mass - loss rate than for planets in the jeans escape regime @xcite .",
    "for example , oxygen , carbon , and magnesium were detected in the upper atmosphere of hd 209458b at a distance of several planetary radii , which indicates that its atmosphere is undergoing hydrodynamic escape @xcite .",
    "the estimated atmosphere mass - loss rate for hd 209458b is @xmath6 @xmath7gs@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the masses of 22 sub - jovian @xmath1 planet pairs with the orbital periods of @xmath9 8 days using the ttv data and found that the mass - radius relationship of these planets corresponds to the constant escape velocity @xmath920kms@xmath8 , which is similar to the sound speed of hydrogen plasma at @xmath10 k , indicating that hydrodynamic evaporation is likely .",
    "the atmospheric mass loss due to evaporation during planetary evolution can be estimated by considering an energy - limited model .",
    "this scenario assumes that a portion of the heating energy of stellar irradiation contributes to @xmath11d@xmath12 work that expands the upper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rate in the energy - limited model depends on the strength of stellar xuv irradiation , including both x - ray and euv flux , and the heating efficiency , which describes how much heating is converted to @xmath11d@xmath12 work . following the temporal evolution of the xuv emission from a sun - like star and assuming 100% heating efficiency ,",
    "early studies showed that even a jovian planet can lose its entire initial envelope during its lifetime at close - in orbits @xcite .",
    "however , later hydrodynamic simulations of euv - driven atmospheric escape show that although the euv - driven mass flow can produce the observed lyman-@xmath13 absorption signatures , this mechanism can only evaporate a small portion of the mass of a jovian planet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that , in the energy - limited model , the assumption that the incoming irradiation is absorbed inside a single layer is inaccurate because the absorption depth of the incident radiation depends on the wavelength .",
    "@xcite found that atmospheric evaporation is in a radiation - recombination - limited regime for high euv flux . in this regime ,",
    "a large portion of the heating energy is lost to cooling radiation , which decreases the mass - loss rate .",
    "@xcite showed that atmospheric evaporation can be either x - ray- or euv - driven , depending on the x - ray and euv flux .",
    "most planets are in an x - ray - driven evaporation regime at the beginning of evolution and then transition to an euv - driven regime when the x - ray flux falls below a critical value .",
    "this transition indicates that using the total xuv fluxes in an evaporation model is insufficient because , in various regimes , the escape flow is dominated by the stellar irradiation at different wavelengths , either x - ray or euv @xcite .    unlike jovian planets , neptune - like planets and super - earths are most likely to lose their entire envelopes at small distances @xcite .",
    "because the mass - loss timescale for planets scales with the planetary mass @xmath14 the planetary mean density , the planetary thermal evolution coupled with atmospheric escape can elucidate the observed threshold for low - density planets in the @xmath15 versus distance@xmath16 parameter space , above which there is no low - mass , low - density transiting exoplanets have not been found @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that evaporation can create a bimodal planet size distribution around @xmath17 . in an extensive investigation of evaporation that included thousands of planets with different sizes and incident fluxes",
    ", @xcite recently showed that the bimodal distribution near @xmath17 was unclear .",
    "in addition , they observed a diagonal region in the semi - major axis versus radius ( @xmath2-@xmath18 ) space , where planets are relatively rare .",
    "herein , we simulate the thermal evolution of synthetic planet populations that were obtained from a planet formation code @xcite . the atmospheric mass - loss due to hydrodynamic evaporation is now included in the planetary evolution .",
    "thereby , we aim to determine how evaporation statistically affects the entire planet population and to make a more consistent comparison with the @xmath1 data .",
    "our results show that the @xmath2-@xmath18 space is strongly influenced by evaporation , which can modify the size distribution of the planets within 1 au .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath19 [",
    "sect : evapmodel ] , we describe the evaporation models used herein . our improved atmospheric model and numerical experiments on planet evolution are shown in @xmath19 [ sect : planetevolution ] . in @xmath19 [",

    "the dominant heating source of hydrodynamic outflow is either euv or x - ray radiation , which divides the hydrodynamic evaporation into two distinct sub - regimes @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use a model that includes both euv - driven and x - ray - driven evaporation through simple semi - analytical equations .",
    "x - ray photons have a smaller interaction cross - section compared with euv photons ; thus , they penetrate deeper into the planetary atmosphere . in the early stage of planetary evolution ,",
    "x - ray irradiation is an important heating source for planetary atmospheres due to strong x - ray emissions from young stars @xcite . in this work",
    ", the mass - loss rate in an x - ray - driven regime is calculated using an an energy - limited model and by assuming that part of the heating energy is converted to @xmath11d@xmath12 work with the efficiency factor @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the planetary mass , @xmath23 is the planet s radius at the optical depth @xmath24 in the thermal wavelengths .",
    "( @xmath25 is calculated using the grain - free rosseland mean opacity @xmath26 from @xcite and @xcite ) , @xmath27 is the x - ray flux in the wavelength range from 1 to 20 @xmath28 from @xcite , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 accounts for the enhanced mass - loss rate by a factor of @xmath31 because the roche lobe of a close - in planet can be close to the planet s surface @xcite . @xcite discuss the possible values of the efficiency factor in energy - limited model and consider a realistic range of 0.1 - 0.25 . considering that it is the x - ray from 5 to 10 @xmath28 responsible for heating @xcite , the x - ray flux from 1 to 20 @xmath28 used in our model might be too high .",
    "thus , we set the nominal efficiency factor in the x - ray - driven regime to 0.1 .",
    "we also set it to 0.2 for a comparison population synthesis to generate larger mass - loss rates .",
    "euv photons ( @xmath32 ev ) can ionize the hydrogen in the upper atmosphere through the photoelectric effect . because the h recombination cooling peak lies slightly above @xmath10 k",
    ", photoionization - recombination will produce an equilibrium temperature of @xmath9 @xmath10 k in the ionized region @xcite .",
    "based on the strength of the incoming euv radiation , euv - driven evaporation can be further divided into two sub - regimes @xcite :    at high euv fluxes with @xmath33 , a large fraction of the heating is lost to cooling radiation .",
    "the mass - loss rate increases slowly with the incoming flux as @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mass - loss rate can not be estimated using a linear energy - limited equation of incident flux .",
    "assuming that the escape flow is isothermal , the mass - loss rate is simply the mass flux at the sonic point in the flow @xcite , we have @xmath35 where @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath37 k is the temperature at the sonic point , @xmath38 is the sonic point where the mass flow escapes the planet at the sound speed , and @xmath39 is the flow density at the sonic point , which was calculated as described in @xcite .    for @xmath40 , the mass - loss rate is calculated using an energy - limited model that is similar to equation [ mdotxray ] .",
    "the difference is that the @xmath27 used here is given by the euv fluxes of a sun - like star from @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 in the euv - driven regime is set as the planetary radius where the optical depth becomes unity for euv photons ( 20 ev ) , at a pressure of @xmath9 1 nanobar @xcite .",
    "the efficiency factor is set by comparing equation [ mdotxray ] with equation 19 in @xcite , which is an analytical equation used to estimate the mass - loss rates at a low @xmath41 and does not include the roche lobe term @xmath42 the efficiency factor is 0.06 in the nominal evaporation model and 0.12 in the comparison population synthesis .",
    "we adopt the criterion from @xcite , which states that , for @xmath41 @xmath43 , evaporation is in the radiation - recombination - limited regime for hot jupiters orbiting main - sequence solar analogs . in reality , the critical @xmath41 ( @xmath44 ) for the transition from a radiation - recombination- to an energy - limited evaporation is a function of the planetary mass and radius , among other characteristics . in our work",
    ", we simply choose a constant @xmath44 @xmath45 for each planet .",
    "the variations of this critical value and its influence on the final planet population will be described in @xmath19 [ modelruns ] .      whether evaporation is x - ray- or euv - driven depends on the intensity of the euv and x - ray irradiation received by a planet .",
    "we use the criterion from @xcite , which separates x - ray- and euv - driven regimes based on whether the x - ray - driven flow can reach the sonic point before it enters the ionization front . this criterion can be determined based on the euv luminosity of the host star .",
    "the threshold euv luminosity for the escape flow in an euv - driven regime is @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the euv luminosity ( in photons per second ) of the host star , @xmath48 ( typically @xmath49 1/3 ) is a geometric factor that approximates the steepness of the density fall - off in the ionized portion of the x - ray - heated flow @xcite , @xmath50 is the ratio of the x - ray sonic surface to the planetary radius ( it is of order unity @xcite ; we set it to 1.5 herein ) , and @xmath51 is the mass flux of the x - ray - driven flow that enters the ionization front .",
    "the synthetic planet populations adopted herein are based on a planet formation model @xcite , in which we simulate the accretion of solid / gas materials and the disc - based migration of a planet in combination with the evolution of a protoplanetary gas disk . at 8 myr ,",
    "nearly all protoplanetary gas disks have disappeared @xcite ; thereafter , the planets enter the evolution stage , where both gas accretion and disk - driven migration end . planet - planet scattering and kozai migration is not included in the model because we use the one - embryo - per - disk approximation .",
    "we take a snapshot of each planet in a population at 10 myr and set it as the initial condition of the evolution stage .",
    "we use the following parameters for each planet : core mass , envelope mass , luminosity , mass - fraction of the ice in the core , initial deuterium fraction , and semi - major axis .",
    "the population - wide effect of atmospheric evaporation is our main focus .",
    "we consider two variable quantities in population synthesis : one is the description of the evaporation model that varies with the dominant heating source ( x - ray , euv , or both ) and heating efficiency , and the other is the ism grain opacity reduction factor used during the formation stage .",
    "the grain opacity during the formation phase controls the amount of h / he a core of given mass and luminosity can accrete @xcite .",
    "we follow the evolution of different synthetic planet populations using different evaporation models .",
    "the details for each simulation are listed in table [ tab : simulist ] .",
    "all populations are formed around a 1 @xmath52 star and using the one - embryo - per - disk approximation .",
    "a description of the concurrent formation of several planets can be found in @xcite .",
    "we define the nominal evaporation model as one that includes both x - ray - and euv - driven regimes .",
    "the nominal synthetic population is defined as a population calculated using the isothermal type i migration rate @xcite with a reduction factor of 0.1 and a grain opacity reduction factor ( @xmath53 ) of 0.003 compared with the full ism value .",
    "the low - mass , close - in planets in this population are formed based on a protoplanetary disk that includes the stellar irradiation for calculating the disk s temperature structure , and the combined viscous and thermal criteria for the transition from type i to type ii migration .",
    "these assumptions are more realistic than the assumptions in @xcite , wherein non - irradiated disks were used with only the thermal criterion and a type i migration rate with a reduction factor of 0.001 .",
    "the inner boundary of the disk in our model is 0.1 au due to limitations in the stellar irradiation description for the disk @xcite .",
    "radial velocity and transit surveys have detected many planets within 0.1 au , which demonstrates that even close - in planets with orbital periods less than 10 days are common @xcite .",
    "planets can reach close - in orbits through disk - driven migration @xcite or migration due to planetesimal disk dynamics @xcite .",
    "a close - in planet may also be formed through kozai migration with tidal circularization @xcite , but this process can take considerably longer , and the intense atmospheric evaporation stage may have passed . because the inner boundary ( 0.1 au ) in the semi - major axis distribution of our planet populations is too large to reasonably study hydrodynamic evaporation , we manually shift the semi - major axes of all planets inward by 0.04 au ; thus , the planet populations begin at 0.06 au .",

    "the isotropic temperature profile is only used for the comparison group shown in figure [ fig : mrrg ] . in our population syntheses , planetary evolution is calculated using the globally averaged temperature profile .",

    "the large differences between the radii of the cores and the total planetary radii show that the planetary envelope with only 0.1% of the planetary mass produces a large increase in the planetary radius , which is a well - known effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , at an equilibrium temperature of 500 k , a planet with a total mass of approximately 1 @xmath91 and an envelope of 0.1% of the planetary mass will have a radius that is greater than 2 @xmath0 .",
    "the planet s atmosphere is bloated due to its low surface gravity and the heating from the incoming irradiation .",
    "consequently , the planetary radius will decrease dramatically after its entire envelope is removed through evaporation .",

    "the final bulk composition of this planet includes a 15 @xmath91 core with a 2.9 @xmath91 envelope , and the planetary radius is 5.67 @xmath0 .",
    "the discontinuous change in the mass - loss rate for this experiment demonstrates that the critical euv flux , which delimits the radiation - recombination - limited and energy - limited evaporation regimes , is in principle inappropriate for this neptunian planet . in figure",
    "[ fig : single ] , we also show the evolution of the same planet but using different @xmath44 at @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "notably , these two experiments only include euv - driven evaporation . when x - ray - driven evaporation is included in the model , most of the planets that could be evaporated to bare cores lost their entire envelope when the evaporation remained in the x - ray - driven regime .",
    "thus , the constant @xmath44 used for the low - mass planets in our model will not excessively affect the population - wide radius distribution , as shown in the following section .",
    "for the jovian planet , the evaporation models with or without x - ray - driven mass - loss do not show significantly different final results .",
    "the modeled planet has a 25 @xmath91 core and a 290 @xmath91 envelope .",
    "as shown in the right column of figure [ fig : single ] , the evolution of this planet under different evaporation models overlaps during the 10 gyr s evolution .",
    "the only notable difference between the two runs is that , in the first 100 myr , the mass - loss rate in the x - ray - driven regime is approximately 18-fold greater than in the euv - driven , radiation - recombination - limited regime .",
    "this difference is insufficient for producing a notable change in the planetary mass and radius because the total mass of the envelope lost only composes a small fraction of the planetary mass . in the end ,",
    "the experiment that also included x - ray - driven evaporation lost @xmath9 2.29 @xmath91 of the envelope , and the other run , which did not include x - ray - driven evaporation , lost @xmath9 0.72 @xmath91 of the envelope .",
    "the only way for a jovian planet to lose a significant portion of its envelope is by assuming an energy - limited evaporation model with a 100% heating efficiency @xcite . in this case , the jovian planet began with a mass - loss rate greater than @xmath101yr@xmath8 .",
    "with this high mass - loss rate , the planetary radius expands at approximately @xmath102 years due to the entropy change in the outer radiative layers .",
    "detailed descriptions of this interesting process can be found in @xcite . in turn ,",
    "the larger planetary radius results in an even greater mass - loss rate .",
    "beginning at @xmath103 years , the planet reaches a runaway mass - loss stage , as observed by @xcite .",
    "eventually , the planet loses its entire initial envelope after @xmath104 years of evolution .      in figure [ fig : grid ] , we show a parameter study on evaporation .",
    "we consider three parameters : the planetary semi - major axis , the planetary core mass , and the ratio of the planetary envelope mass to the core mass ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the parameter space is similar to @xcite , where the incident flux from the star is used instead of the planetary semi - major axis because the distance from a planet to its host star essentially determines the incident flux that the planet can receive for a fixed stellar type .",
    "the modeled planets are located at 0.03 - 0.5 au with a core of 1 - 40 @xmath91 . at each semi - major axis and each core mass , four planets have different @xmath105 , i.e. , 1% , 10% , 20% , and 80% .",
    "we do not consider planets with a larger @xmath105 . due to the long kelvin - helmholtz timescale ,",
    "it is unlikely that a small core will accrete significant levels of gas during the formation stage .",
    "a massive core may accrete high levels of gas , but the effect of evaporation on gas giants is small , as shown in figure [ fig : single ] ; thus , gas giants are not included in this parameter study . because all planets in this parameter study are artificial bodies without an initial luminosity from the self - consistent planet formation stage , we set their initial luminosities to the value that corresponds to an entropy at the core - envelope boundary that equals @xmath106 .",
    "this is an empirical fit of the central entropies of the planets with a 1 - 40 @xmath91 core and a @xmath105 of 1%-80% in our synthetic population at 10 myr .",
    "this fit shows that the initial entropy of a planet increases with the core mass and envelope to core mass fraction .",
    "the initial entropy of low - mass planets is an interesting subject that will be investigated separately in future work .",
    "the left column of figure [ fig : grid ] shows the evolution of the simulation using the nominal evaporation model , which includes both the x - ray- and euv - driven mechanisms .",
    "four snapshots of this simulation ( at 20 myr , 110 myr , 1 gyr , and 5 gyr ) are presented . at 20 myr ( after 10 myr of evolution ) , all of the planets in the bottom left corner have lost their entire envelopes and have become bare rocky cores .",
    "there are two reasons for this observation : one , the large planetary radii due to the heating effect from the intense stellar irradiation and large planetary intrinsic entropies during the early stage and , two , the manually fixed @xmath105 for small cores can be substantially higher than predicted in the formation calculations . in particular , the formation calculations do not produce cores of 1 , 2 , or 5 @xmath91 with a @xmath105 of 80% at 0.03 or 0.05 au .",
    "the high temperature at the outer boundary and large initial luminosities for these small planets with a large @xmath105 appear to produce an unstable envelope structure that can not be modeled using the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation .",
    "the only structure that we find for these planets is a bloated atmosphere that expands beyond the hill sphere , which is unstable .",
    "thus , their initial atmospheres evaporate in a short time .",
    "@xcite show comparable cases with low - mass planets undergoing a similar dynamic , i.e. , runaway mass - loss .",
    "after the early , intense , x - ray - driven evaporation stage , the evaporation transitions to the moderate radiation - recombination - limited or energy - limited euv - driven regimes and the snapshots at the 1 gyr and 5 gyr only slightly differ .",
    "the three panels in the right column compare the final status of the three simulations , with the only difference between them being the evaporation model .",
    "one uses the nominal model , which includes both x - ray- and euv - driven mechanisms , another only uses the euv - driven evaporation model , and a third uses the same energy - limited evaporation model as that in @xcite .",
    "the final configurations of these three groups are similar : the planets in the bottom left corner become bare rocky cores , while planets with large cores at large semi - major axes retain most of their initial envelopes .",
    "the differences between these three groups lie in the diagonal region of each panel .",
    "x - ray - driven evaporation in the early stage is more effective at removing planetary atmosphere than euv - driven evaporation ; thus , the diagonal region in the simulation using the nominal evaporation model includes more bare cores than the simulation using only the euv - driven mechanism .",
    "the simulation using the energy - limited evaporation model in @xcite produces the greatest mass - loss .",
    "consequently , it includes the fewest planets with portions of their initial envelopes , and the @xmath105 of each planet at 5 gyr is the smallest of the three simulations .",
    "we then couple planetary population synthesis with different evaporation models to determine the population - wide effect of atmospheric evaporation .",
    "first , in figure [ fig : arhomdotfid ] , [ fig : amfid ] , and [ fig : arfid ] , we show the evolution of the mass - loss rates , mass and radius distribution of our nominal planetary population using the nominal evaporation model.we then investigate the influence of the efficiency of evaporation mechanism . in figure",
    "[ fig:6arhomdot ] , [ fig:6am ] , [ fig:6ar ] , and [ fig:6mr ] , we compare the mass - loss rates , mass and radius distributions , and mass - radius relationships using different evaporation models ( or without evaporation ) .",
    "the effect of the different grain opacities used during the planetary formation stage is demonstrated by the mass - radius relationships of three different planet populations in figure [ fig : nio ] .",
    "finally , we compare the radius distribution of our synthetic populations with the @xmath1 data in figure [ fig:3histo ] and [ fig:9histo ] .          in simulation xe",
    "( see table [ tab : simulist ] ) , we apply the nominal evaporation model ( x - ray + euv ) to the nominal planetary population ; therefore , it is referred to as our reference simulation . in figure",
    "[ fig : arhomdotfid ] , we plot the temporal evolution of the planet mass - loss rates for simulation xe in the planet s semi - major axis versus mean density plane .",
    "the evaporation rates of close - in planets are large at 0.02 gyr and 0.11 gyr . at 0.02 gyr , close - in planets at 0.06 au can have a mass - loss rate of @xmath9 @xmath107 @xmath91 yr@xmath8 .",
    "the mass - loss rates for most of planets beyond 1 au are less than @xmath108 @xmath91 yr@xmath8 . at 1 gyr ,",
    "nearly all planets that retain portions of their envelope have a mass - loss rate of less than @xmath108 @xmath91 yr@xmath8 , which explains why the envelope mass fractions and radius distributions in figure [ fig : amfid ] and figure [ fig : arfid ] ( in the following section ) barely change after 1 gyr .",
    "the parallel dashed lines show identical mass - loss rates for a purely energy - limited evaporation model ( i.e. , the planets along each line have the same mass - loss rate as those in the energy - limited regime ) ; the mass - loss rate is a function of the planet s mean density and incoming flux .",
    "we use an energy - limited model in both the x - ray and the low euv regimes ; thus , most of the color belts in figure [ fig : arhomdotfid ] are parallel to these dashed lines . at 0.02 gyr , a considerable portion of the planets are in the radiation - recombination - limited regime at @xmath9 0.2 to 1 au ; hence , the yellow and orange belts slightly deviate from the parallel dashed lines . from 1 gyr ,",
    "nearly all of the planets are in the energy - limited , euv - driven regime , and the color belts closely follow the parallel dashed lines .    figure [ fig : amfid ] shows the temporal evolution of the mass versus the semi - major axis ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) distribution of the reference simulation ( the xe simulation ) .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 distribution shows typical sub - populations , such as the numerous low - mass  failed cores \" that only accrete a limited quantity of gas , as well as many giant planets that preferentially form outside of the snow line @xcite .",
    "the color of each point in figure [ fig : amfid ] denotes the fraction of the initial envelope that is lost for this planet ( i.e. , 1.0 indicates that a planet has lost all of its initial h / he , and 0 means that the planet retains its entire envelope ) .",
    "the black region in the bottom right corner corresponds to the planets that have lost their entire initial envelope .",
    "the snapshot at 0.11 gyr presents a greatly increased black bare - core region ; however , the further increase is small for 1 and 5 gyr .",
    "the critical planetary mass below which a planet can lose its entire envelope ( @xmath109 ) has the form @xmath110 .",
    "for example , at t = 10 gyr the critical planetary mass is @xmath111 , while @xmath112 .",
    "most of the fully depleted planets are low - mass  failed cores \" ( @xmath113 ) that only accrete a small envelope during the formation stage .",
    "although these planets have evaporated to bare , rocky cores , they do not lose a substantial amount of their total mass because their initial envelope masses are substantially lower than their core masses .",
    "neptunian planets have greater initial envelope mass fractions , but it is difficult for them to lose a large portion of their envelopes .",
    "all of the jovian planets retain most of their envelopes .",
    "thus , the @xmath2-@xmath3 distribution of the entire planet population exhibits nearly no change : the four snapshots in figure [ fig : amfid ] all have similar shapes .",
    "notably , herein we only include planets with @xmath114 ; these results will differ for planets at very close - in orbits .            however , the @xmath2-@xmath18 distribution of the entire planetary population is clearly modified by evaporation .",
    "figure [ fig : arfid ] shows the @xmath2-@xmath18 distribution of the same reference simulation .",
    "first , certain features are related to the planet formation and evolution model .",
    "for example , the empty region from 0.2 to 2 au at 0.11 gyr is an artifact of using a minimal core mass of 1 @xmath91 in the formation calculations .",
    "this region is left empty because protoplanets inside the ice line quickly accrete all planetesimals in their feeding zones .",
    "therefore , their luminosities are low and are mostly attributed to gas accretion . for a fixed core mass under these circumstances , the envelope mass increases with orbital distance ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because more gas can be bound at lower nebula temperatures , which translates into a larger radius and makes the hollow higher at larger distances ( to approximately 2 au ) . outside of this distance ,",
    "another effect becomes dominant : the solid accretion timescale is longer , which makes that certain planets have high luminosities ( due to planetesimal accretion ) at the end of the disk lifetime .",
    "these planets can only hold tenuous envelopes and no longer retain a relationship with the orbital distance .",
    "in reality , there is no minimal core mass ; therefore , this empty region should not exist in the actual @xmath2-@xmath18 plot .",
    "a very similar artifact can be seen in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite .",
    "one real visible effect of planetary evolution can be observed by the decrease of the planetary radii of the entire population due to planet cooling .",
    "note the sharp upper limit for the planetary radius , which is artificially sharp because , first , no special bloating mechanisms are included ( e.g. , ohmic heating , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and second , the opacity , which can affect cooling @xcite , is identical for each planet .",
    "the features related to evaporation are shown by the color of each point , which represents the fraction of the initial envelope that evaporated . here",
    ", we use black points to indicate the planets that have lost their entire envelopes ( the bottom left region of each panel ) . as indicated ,",
    "when a planet becomes a bare rocky core , it settles to the bottom of the @xmath2-@xmath18 plane and detaches from the planets that retain at least a portion of their initial envelopes ; this settling leads to the formation of an empty region that runs diagonally downward in the @xmath2-@xmath18 plane between 0.06 and 0.5 au .",
    "this empty diagonal belt separates the bare rocky cores from the planets that retain an envelope , which , henceforth , we refer to as an  evaporation valley \" .",
    "the evaporation valley occurs because the radius of a purely rocky planet is substantially smaller than that of a planet with both a core and gaseous envelope .",
    "for example , an envelope at only 0.1% of the planetary mass can dramatically enhance the planetary radius ( figure [ fig : mrrg ] ) .",
    "additionally , the last 0.1% of the envelope is lost on a short timescale , @xmath115 yrs ; therefore , we are unlikely to detect a planet when it lies in the evaporation valley",
    ". thus , an empty valley appears in the @xmath2-@xmath18 plane after many low - mass planets have become bare , rocky cores . at 0.02 gyr",
    ", the valley only appears within @xmath9 0.1 au , and rapidly extends to @xmath9 0.3 au at 0.11 gyr .",
    "clearly , the empty valley is only expected if all low - mass planets begin with significant h / he envelopes , which is unlikely .",
    "we discuss this topic further in @xmath19 [ sect : dis41 ] .",
    "the separated distribution of low - mass planets within 0.5 au suggests a bimodal size distribution of the close - in low - mass planets , which was first theoretically observed by @xcite . a similar but weaker structure",
    "was also demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "we show the size distributions for our synthetic planet populations in @xmath19 [ sect : comparison ] .      to determine how our results depend on the evaporation description , we simulate the evolution of the same nominal planet population but using different evaporation models .",
    "table [ tab : simulist ] lists the details for these simulations .",
    "simulation xe is our reference .",
    "simulation noev is planetary evolution without evaporation .",
    "simulation sate includes only euv - driven evaporation and assumes that the stellar euv emissions are saturated during the first 100 myr of planetary evolution .",
    "simulation xe2 uses the nominal evaporation model , but the heating efficiency in both the x - ray ( @xmath116 ) and energy - limited euv regime ( @xmath117 ) are twice as high compared with the xe simulation .",
    "simulation l12 uses the energy - limited model from @xcite , which uses the total flux between 1 - 1200 @xmath28 as the incoming energy and 0.1 as the heating efficiency .",
    "simulation b04 uses the energy - limited model from @xcite , which includes a different temporal evolution of the xuv emission from a sun - like star and adopts a 100% heating efficiency .",
    "all the simulations are evolved for 10 gyr .        because we are more interested in the potentially observable influence of these different evaporation models , in figure [ fig:6arhomdot ] , we plot the mass - loss rates of the six simulations at 5 gyr in the semi - major axis versus planetary mass @xmath14 mean density ( @xmath15 ) plane . at 5 gyr ,",
    "only simulation b04 leads to planets with evaporation rates greater than @xmath118 @xmath91 yr@xmath8 .",
    "simulation b04 is also the only simulation in which even a jovian planet can evaporate to a rocky core . at 110 myr ,",
    "the largest mass - loss rates of the gas giants within 0.1 au for simulation b04 are @xmath9 @xmath107 @xmath91 yr@xmath8 ( not shown in the plot ) , which indicates that these planets lose at least 100 @xmath91 in the first 100 myr of planetary evolution because the mass - loss rate of a planet decreases with time .",
    "thus , many planets in simulation b04 , including certain close - in jovian planets , eventually lose their entire envelope .",
    "the mass - loss rates for the other four simulations are significantly smaller ; the typical rate for a planet within 0.1 au at 5 gyr is @xmath9 @xmath108 @xmath91 yr@xmath8 and is @xmath9 @xmath118 @xmath91 yr@xmath8 at 110 myr ( not shown in the plot ) .",
    "the evaporation timescale @xmath119 is proportional to @xmath120 ( @xmath27 is the incoming flux ) in an energy - limited regime ; thus , an evaporation threshold is expected in the semi - major axis versus planetary mass @xmath14 the mean density ( @xmath121 ) plane @xcite .",
    "low - mass , low - density planets below this threshold at the beginning of planetary evolution will be evaporated to bare , rocky cores at high mean densities , and eventually , no planets with h / he are below the threshold , as demonstrated by the solid lines and black dots in figure [ fig:6arhomdot ] .",
    "a similar threshold is also apparent in the noev simulation , which does not include evaporation ; however , in this instance , the cut - off is unclear ( as in the evaporation - inclusive simulations ) , and the threshold is at the lower value of @xmath122 .",
    "this lower limit is an artifact of using a the minimal planetary mass of 1 @xmath91 , which , indicates that the envelope mass for a fixed core mass increases with orbital distance , as discussed above .",
    "evaporation renders this threshold clearer and raises it in the @xmath122 plane . with a substantially stronger evaporation model ,",
    "the evaporation threshold is so high that it intersects the bare , rocky cores ; hence , the evaporation threshold becomes blurred , as demonstrated in the b04 simulation .",
    "if planets with masses lower than 1 @xmath91 are included in our synthetic population , then the evaporation threshold can also be blurred because the low - mass bare rocky cores would extend to lower values of @xmath122 below the threshold .",
    "examples of such low - mass cores include @xmath1 - 10b and corot-6b ( see figure 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig:6am ] shows the @xmath2-@xmath3 distributions at 5 gyr . with the exception of simulation b04 , the remaining five simulations present similar @xmath2-@xmath3 distributions .",
    "the difference for b04 is the severe depletion of planets with masses at 30 - 50 @xmath91 within 0.2 au . at distances smaller than those modeled here ( @xmath123 0.03 au ) ,",
    "the observed planet population includes a desert that may be related to evaporation @xcite . in each simulation , the black bottom left corner corresponds to the planets that have lost their entire envelope .",
    "although the heating efficiency in xe2 is twice that of xe , the black corner in xe2 does not show a large difference compared with xe .",
    "these data indicate that long - term evolution of the entire planet population is not extremely sensitive to the heating efficiency of the evaporation model , at least within the framework of the models listed here . however , if a substantially more violent evaporation model is used , as for b04 , the @xmath2-@xmath3 distribution of the entire planet population noticeably changes .",
    "figure [ fig:6ar ] shows the @xmath2-@xmath18 distributions of the six simulations at 10 gyr .",
    "the color of each point indicates the ratio of the envelope mass to the core mass , @xmath105 . here , all of the simulations that include evaporation show a distinct feature compared with noev : an evaporation valley in the radius distribution at @xmath9 2 @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath105 of each planet does not change in the noev simulation ; thus , based on the colors in the noev snapshot , the initial @xmath105 of a planet generally scales with its core mass .",
    "this finding is expected based on the long kelvin - helmholtz timescales for gas accretion of low - mass cores . for example , only the planets within 0.1 au with a core larger than 10 @xmath91 can have a @xmath105 that exceeds 80% ; low - mass planets with a core smaller than 2 @xmath91 typically have a @xmath105 that is less than 10% .",
    "thus , most low - mass planets with cores at 1 - 3 @xmath91 can be quickly evaporated to bare , rocky cores after evolution has begun ( even in simulation sate , which includes the weakest evaporation model ) .",
    "however , this clear valley only occurs if all these low - mass planets begin with a primordial h / he envelope , which is unlikely in reality . in the actual formation process",
    ", some low - mass planets may reach their final mass only after the dissipation of the gaseous nebula , leading to planets without significant primordial h / he envelopes .",
    "this is in contrast with our synthetic population where no growth via giant impact is included after the protoplanetary disk has dissipated .",
    "when the low - mass planets become bare , rocky cores , they settle to the bottom of the @xmath2-@xmath18 panel and are separated from the planets that retain some h / he . the evaporation valley becomes a large void region for b04 , for which the mass - loss rates are so high that most planets within 0.2 au have evaporated to bare cores , including certain gas giants with @xmath124 .",
    "such strong planet depletion between @xmath9 2 and @xmath9 10 @xmath0 is not presented in the observed data ( including @xmath1 candidates ) , which implies that an 100%-efficient , energy - limited evaporation model is incompatible with the observed radius distribution of the extrasolar planets .",
    "figure [ fig:6mr ] compares the mass - radius relationship of the planets between 0.06 - 1 au at 5 gyr for the six simulations using different evaporation models .",
    "the planetary radii plotted in the figure are at the optical depth @xmath24 .",
    "compared with the old grey model @xcite , the semi - grey model used for the atmosphere increases the radius of close - in planets due to stellar irradiation @xcite .",
    "this effect is demonstrated by the low - mass planets at small semi - major axes , such as planets with masses of 1 - 2 @xmath91 but radii of 3 - 5 @xmath0 in the simulation noev , which does not include an evaporation model .",
    "these low - mass planets have low densities .",
    "for example , the mean density of a 1.5 @xmath91 , 4 @xmath0 planet is only @xmath9 0.13 g @xmath125 .",
    "the evaporation valley in figure [ fig:6ar ] and evaporation threshold in figure [ fig:6arhomdot ] can also be observed in the mass - radius relationships in figure [ fig:6mr ] . the black bar at the bottom of each panel in the five simulations that included evaporation corresponds to the rocky cores of the planets that have lost their entire envelopes .",
    "note that with the migration model used here , all close - in low - mass planets that become bare cores have only accreted inside of the iceline , giving them a rocky interior .",
    "this could be different for higher migration rates , or if several planets form concurrently in one disk @xcite . in the current model",
    ", we assume that all rocky cores have an identical composition ( 2:1 silicate : iron ratio , as in earth ) . in reality , this ratio ( and the composition of refractory element ) depends on the stellar composition and a planet s formation history , such as large impacts .",
    "the black bar creates a gap at @xmath9 2 @xmath0 , which separates the bare cores from the planets that retain at least a portion of their initial envelopes .",
    "this feature clearly corresponds to the evaporation valley in figure [ fig:6ar ] ) .",
    "the length of this black bar is related to the efficiency of evaporation mechanism .",
    "simulation sate includes the lowest mass - loss rates ; consequently , it produces the shortest black bar .",
    "simulation b04 produces the longest black bar , extending to @xmath126 , and certain black points are massive cores from stripped gas giants . in simulation b04 , no planets with @xmath127 within 1 au maintain their primordial h / he .",
    "another difference between noev and the other five simulations is the disappearance of low - mass , very low - density planets .",
    "this result is similar to the evaporation threshold in figure [ fig:6arhomdot ] .",
    "when evaporation is included in planetary evolution , the bloated envelopes of close - in , low - mass planets are rapidly removed .",
    "thus , an upper threshold is depicted in the bottom left corner of the mass - radius distribution ( for planets within 1 au ) .",
    "planets that are initially above this threshold will lose at least a portion of their initial envelopes until they are sufficiently dense that they lie below the threshold .",
    "this threshold is also related to the efficiency of evaporation mechanism ; in simulation b04 , the threshold occurs at larger planetary masses compared with simulation sate .",
    "various evaporation models have been applied to the nominal planet population that is calculated using the isothermal type i migration rate reduced by a factor of 0.1 @xcite .",
    "this is an artificial factor that prevents most synthetic planets from falling into the star @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that , depending on the temperature profile of the disc , type i migration can also induce outward migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in principle , the artificial reduction factor may be eliminated even if the migration still seems to be too rapidly inward , mainly due to saturation of the corrotation torques @xcite . here",
    ", we apply the nominal evaporation model to three synthetic populations that are all calculated using the full non - isothermal type i migration rate from @xcite .",
    "the difference between these three populations is the ism grain opacity reduction factor , @xmath53 , which is used during the formation stage . for the planet population in simulation niopa003 ,",
    "we use an @xmath53 at 0.003 ( the nominal value ) during formation ; in simulation niopa0 , the @xmath53 equals 0 ( no grain opacity ) , and in simulation niopa1 , the @xmath53 equals 1 ( full ism grain opacity ) .",
    "the details are in table [ tab : simulist ] and @xcite .",
    "lower grain opacity during formation phase yields a higher envelope mass for a given core mass because it is more efficient to radiate away the liberated potential energy , allowing the envelope to contract .",
    "this means that , at low @xmath53 , planets with a lower mean density are formed , which is indicated by a larger maximal radius for a given mass in the mass - radius diagram . in contrast , the atmospheric opacity during planetary evolution is identical for all three populations and is given via the opacity of a grain - free gas with a solar composition @xcite .    the features that are related to evaporation , such as",
    "the black bottom left corner in the @xmath2-@xmath3 diagram , the evaporation valley in the @xmath2-@xmath18 distribution , and the black bar , which indicates purely rocky cores in the mass - radius plot , have been detailed above and are similar among these three populations . here , we focus on the features related to the effect of @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig : nio ] shows the mass - radius relationships of the planets within 1 au for the niopa003 , niopa0 , and niopa1 simulations .",
    "one of the effects of the different grain opacities during formation is the number of giant planets @xcite .",
    "as shown in the figure , the niopa0 group includes the most gas giants , while the niopa1 group shows the opposite result .",
    "this effect is more clearly demonstrated by the histogram of planet size distributions in figure [ fig:9histo ] in the following subsection .",
    "another effect is that , in simulation niopa0 , the largest overall radius ( at a mass of @xmath9 4 @xmath128 ) is slightly larger than for the other two simulations . at @xmath129 ,",
    "even very low - mass cores can become supercritical and trigger giant planet formation @xcite .",
    "these giant planets with low - mass cores yield large planetary radii .",
    "a third effect , as extensively discussed in @xcite , is the effect of @xmath53 on the mass - radius relationship of low - mass planets . with a low @xmath53 ,",
    "even cores with only a few @xmath91 can accrete significant envelope masses , thereby producing large radii .",
    "this result is clearly visible in figure [ fig : nio ] .",
    "for example , at 10 @xmath91 , the maximum radii are approximately 3.5 , 5.5 , and 7.5 @xmath0 for @xmath53 = 1 , 0.03 , and 0 , respectively .",
    "the effect of the grain opacity during formation on the observable mass - radius relationship as discussed in @xcite ( who neglected evaporation ) is also found here , even if the very low - mass , low - density planets are removed by evaporation .",
    "figure [ fig:3histo ] shows the temporal evolution of the normalized size distribution for simulation xe . for comparison with the observations ,",
    "we only show the size distributions for the planets within 1 au .",
    "there are three peaks in the planet size distributions , all of which form at an early evolutionary stage .",
    "the first peak is at @xmath9 1 @xmath0 , which corresponds to the bare , rocky cores of the low - mass planets that have entirely lost their initial envelopes .",
    "the third peak , at 11 - 12 @xmath0 , @xmath130 , indicates the sub - population of jovian planets and is a consequence of degeneracy of the electrons in the interior ; all giant planets with masses larger than @xmath9 saturn have the same radius of approximately @xmath130 .",
    "compared with the actual population , this effect must be overestimated in our results because all planets evolved with the same opacity , and bloating mechanisms are not included .",
    "the middle peak at 2 - 4 @xmath0 corresponds to the sub - population of super - earths and neptunian planets that retain an envelope .",
    "@xcite found that evaporation leads to a bimodal distribution in planetary size with a planet deficit at approximately 2 @xmath0 .",
    "our results show a similar bimodal distribution with a minimum at approximately 2 @xmath0 ; however , this deficit is substantially more severe at @xmath9 1.2 - 2 @xmath0 .",
    "the normalized size distribution of all @xmath1 candidates ( released feb 26 , 2012 ) , most of which are within 1 au , are also plotted for comparison in the 5 gyr panel .",
    "notably , the @xmath1 data are biased and incomplete for @xmath131 because the detection efficiency of the star and the detection sensitivity of the planet decrease towards small planetary radii and larger semi - major axes .",
    "the planetary occurrence of @xmath1 candidates with a correction for observational bias produces a nearly flat distribution at 1 - 3 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:3histo ] shows that the wide evaporation valley in our result is not compatible with @xmath1 data .",
    "there are three possible reasons for this observation .",
    "( 1 ) our evaporation model either overestimates evaporation or is too deterministic because all stars in our simulation have the same mass and xuv flux as a function of time .",
    "( 2 ) we assume that all low - mass planets begin with a primordial h / he envelope . in reality",
    ", there is likely a population of close - in , low - mass planets that formed without h / he via planet impacts after the dissipation of the nebula @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the distinct evaporation valley is related to our identical core composition ( 2:1 silicate : iron ratio ) . as mentioned , the migration model ( 0.1 isothermal migration rate of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicts that all close - in low - mass planets loosing the entire envelope have a rocky interior ( migration only inside of the iceline ) . in reality , the actual core composition of close - in planets might be highly diverse ( i.e. , contains some ice ) . in the 5 gyr panel",
    ", we also plotted the normalized size distribution for @xmath1 candidates within 0.1 au , which are planets that are more likely to be eroded by evaporation .",
    "these candidates accumulate at @xmath9 1 - 3 @xmath0 , while the close - in @xmath1 candidates corrected for the observational bias have a nearly flat distribution at 1 - 3 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus , the evaporation valley in our synthetic planet populations was not observed in the @xmath1 data . in a following paper , we show that , by varying the ice fraction of the planetary cores , the radii of the bare , rocky cores can be substantially larger ; the dip in the evaporation valley is thus eliminated .",
    "this means that important observational constrains for planet formation and migration theory can be deduced from evolutionary models with atmospheric escape ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig:9histo ] compares the normalized size distribution of @xmath1 candidates with our non - nominal simulations . with the exception of noev , which does not include evaporation , and b04 , which has a 100% heating efficiency in the energy - limited regime ,",
    "the remaining seven simulations show a bimodal distribution at small sizes .",
    "as mentioned , an additional peak is at 1 @xmath132 for the gas giants .",
    "simulation noev yields only one peak at 3 - 4 @xmath0 ; this occurs because the low - mass planets maintain their envelopes and , hence , have large planetary radii .",
    "the simulation b04 group is another extreme case that yields a single peak at 1 - 2 @xmath0 .",
    "most of the low - mass planets in simulation b04 evaporated to bare , rocky cores ; thus , the number of neptunian planets that retain an envelope is too small to produce a second peak . in the other seven simulations ,",
    "the inner peak in the bimodal distribution is at 1.0 - 1.2 @xmath0 , which corresponds to bare , rocky cores with a 2:1 silicate : iron ratio . for different simulations ,",
    "the outer peaks in the bimodal distribution differ slightly in both magnitude and location .",
    "a stronger evaporation model will produce a lower outer peak and move the position of the peak to smaller planet sizes , as shown in the top two rows of figure [ fig:9histo ] , where the only difference between these simulations is the evaporation model .",
    "the effect of the grain opacity reduction factor , @xmath53 , is apparent in the bottom row of figure [ fig:9histo ] .",
    "because planets grow faster at smaller @xmath53 , the niopa0 group contains the largest number of gas giants .",
    "consequently , the niopa0 group has the highest peak at @xmath9 12 @xmath0 ; the niopa1 group is the opposite .",

    "title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "the bimodal distribution for planet sizes at approximately 2 @xmath0 was first observed by @xcite , in which the hydrodynamic evaporation of a theoretical planet population was studied .",
    "@xcite observe a diagonal band , on which planets are relatively rare ; the bimodal distribution near @xmath17 is less clear in their results . in our results ,",
    "this diagonal band @xcite becomes a distinct evaporation valley .",
    "this evaporation valley separates the bare , rocky cores from the planets that retain an envelope ( figure [ fig:6ar ] ) .",
    "the valley is @xmath9 0.5 @xmath0 wide and occurs at different planet sizes ( from @xmath9 1 to @xmath9 2.5 @xmath0 ) depending on the semi - major axis .",
    "we find that such empty valleys are closely related to the initial characteristics of the synthetic planet population . in our synthetic planet population , all close - in planets begin with a primordial h / he envelope , and their rocky cores have a 2:1 silicate : iron ratio .",
    "due to the long kelvin - helmholtz timescales of low - mass cores , low - mass planets can only have a small initial @xmath105 , which is proportional to the planetary core mass .",
    "as shown in the noev simulation snapshot in figure [ fig:6ar ] , low - mass planets within 0.5 au with a radius @xmath5 4 @xmath0 typically include a @xmath105 @xmath5 10% .",
    "only a planet with @xmath4 6 @xmath0 can have a @xmath105 @xmath133 80% .",
    "thus , low - mass planets are vulnerable to evaporation to bare rocky cores due to their small envelopes and small gravitational binding energies ; these planets form a peak at about 1 @xmath0 in the bimodal radius distribution of low - mass planets ( trimodal , if the giants are included ) .",
    "most close - in neptunian planets can keep at least a portion of their initial envelopes at the end of evolution ; they form the second peak at about 2 - 3 @xmath0 in the bimodal distribution . in a forthcoming paper , we show that the dip of the evaporation valley can be removed by varying the ice fractions of planetary cores : the sizes of bare low - mass icy cores can be @xmath9 2 @xmath0 .      although the semi - grey model is a significant improvement over the grey model used in @xcite , it does not include the effects of non - grey thermal opacities @xcite . neglecting non - grey effects in the planetary atmosphere boundary may lead to an inaccurate planetary radius and , hence , mass - loss rates .",
    "fortunately , we find that the final radius distribution of the entire planet population is not very sensitive to the outer boundary condition .",
    "the exact planetary radius and mass - loss rate are clearly important for individual planets but not so much for the overall statistical impact on the planet population .    to clarify this",
    ", we perform a comparison numerical experiment , the grey simulation , using our nominal planet population but with the previous grey atmospheric model from @xcite .",
    "the grey model assumes that stellar irradiation is absorbed at the upper atmosphere where optical depth equals @xmath134 . for the grey simulation",
    ", we also use the nominal evaporation model ( i.e. , both x - ray- and euv - driven evaporation are included ) .",
    "figure [ fig : arcomp ] compares the @xmath2-@xmath18 distributions of the grey and xe simulations .",
    "the planetary radii are smaller for the grey model , as expected @xcite , but the global effects of evaporation in general and for the evaporation valley in particular remain visible in a similar manner in the @xmath2-@xmath18 space .",
    "the grey simulation produces a narrower gap in the radius distribution because the planetary envelopes from this numerical experiment are less bloated than in simulations using the semi - grey model .",
    "figure [ fig:1histo ] compares the planet size distributions from the grey and xe simulations at 5 gyr .",
    "the grey simulation clearly shows a bimodal distribution at approximately 2 @xmath0 .",
    "the difference is that , compared with xe , the peak of the bare , rocky cores in the grey simulation is less prominent , and the outer peak in the bimodal distribution occurs at a smaller size .",
    "an accurate method to calculate the mass - loss rate due to hydrodynamic escape is to solve the mass , energy , and momentum conservation equations @xcite . in our work",
    ", we used an approximate mass - loss formula in the energy - limited and radiation - recombination - limited regime as well as criteria for determining whether the outflow is euv- or x - ray - driven ; we derived these from different authors @xcite .",
    "thus , our evaporation model includes significant simplifications . in reality , the evaporation efficiency that characterizes the how much heating energy is converted to @xmath11d@xmath12 work depends on the characteristics of a planet and changes with time @xcite . moreover",
    ", the direct transition from an x - ray regime to an euv - driven regime , as used in our model , can produce a discontinuous change in the mass - loss rate , as shown in figure [ fig : single ] .",
    "due to these limitations , we performed several groups of population syntheses using different evaporation models , which allowed us to obtain a likely range of mass - loss rates .",
    "our results show that the evolution and final structure of a single planet may be less accurate due to the evaporation model simplifications but that the statistical information for the entire planet population was not greatly influenced .",
    "for example , the xe2 simulation yields results that are similar to those of the xe simulation even though the heating efficiencies in the xe2 simulation are twice those of xe .",
    "the final mass and radius distributions are not sensitive to heating efficiency for the following reasons . at a fixed incident flux ,",
    "the evaporation threshold scales are @xmath135 .",
    "as shown in the noev panel in figure [ fig:6ar ] , the initial @xmath136 of a planet increases quickly with the planetary mass .",
    "for example , the initial @xmath105 of a 4 @xmath91 planet is typical of @xmath9 10% ; however , for a 2 @xmath91 planet , @xmath9 1% is typical . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the noev panel in figure [ fig:6mr ] shows that the increase of the planetary radius with an increasing planetary mass is not significant for low - mass planets with @xmath137 .",
    "thus , planetary mass plays a dominant role in determining the evaporation threshold .",
    "moreover , atmospheric evaporation is only intense in the early stage for a short time ( with a timescale @xmath9 100 myr ) . when increasing the heating efficiency in an evaporation model , a slow increase is observed for the critical planetary mass below which a planet will be evaporated to a bare rocky core .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:9histo ] , the final planet size distributions from the xe and xe2 simulations only show limited differences . one exception is the b04 simulation , where even jovian planets lose a significant portion of their envelopes ; in this case , the bimodal feature at the small planet size disappears because many neptunian or jovian planets evaporate to bare , rocky cores .",
    "these massive cores finally fill the deficit at @xmath9 2 @xmath0 .",
    "another simplification in our models is that we apply hydrodynamic evaporation to all planets , even for those at large semi - major axes .",
    "in fact , the atmospheric escape of planets at large distances should be included in the jeans escape regime .",
    "whether an escape flow is in the hydrodynamic or jeans regime can be assessed by comparing the mean free path of gas molecules with the local scale height of the flow ( @xcite demonstrate how to implement this criterion in the energy - limited model ) .",
    "@xcite show that , for close - in planets with semi - major axes smaller than 0.1 au , the dominant mass - loss process is hydrodynamic evaporation .",
    "they found that at very small distances , such as @xmath5 0.05 au , even gas giants with a few jupiter masses can lose mass hydrodynamically .",
    "they also show that massive planets with large densities are too gravitationally bound for hydrodynamic outflow . for example , a planet that is more massive than 1 @xmath128 with a density greater than 1 g@xmath138 can no longer undergo hydrodynamic evaporation at @xmath9 1 au .",
    "thus , our models overestimate the mass - loss rates of the planets at large distances by assuming that the planets undergo hydrodynamic evaporation .",
    "however , this assumption does not affect the main statistical results for the entire planet population because only low - mass planets with tenuous envelopes can be evaporated to bare cores at large distances due to the overestimated mass - loss rates .",
    "we also did not include non - thermal ion escape in our models ( e.g. , the planetary ions that are captured by stellar wind ) .",
    "the influence of non - thermal escape on the statistical results is also weak because the mass - loss rate of ion pick - up escape is typically several times smaller than for thermal atmospheric escape @xcite .",
    "most @xmath1 candidates orbit a host star with a mass of 0.8 - 1.1 @xmath52 . during the formation and evolution of our synthetic populations ,",
    "all planets orbit around a sun - like star with a mass of exactly 1 @xmath52 .",
    "the key effect of different stellar types is that they lead to different disk properties , which finally determine the characteristics of the synthetic planet populations @xcite .",
    "massive f / g - type stars are found to yield fewer neptunian planets but more massive jovian planets .",
    "k / m - dwarfs are predicted to yield more neptunian planets but fewer jovian planets @xcite .",
    "however , for the low - mass planets , which are sensitive to evaporation and form a bimodal size distribution , the fraction does not strongly depend on the mass of the central star @xcite .",
    "thus , at least for 0.8 - 1.1 @xmath52 , comparisons between @xmath1 candidates and our synthetic planet populations are feasible .",
    "the stars in our simulations all have the same @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which follows the temporal evolution of the x - rays and euv emissions of a sun - like star . in reality",
    ", the euv flux ( 360 - 920 @xmath28 ) of a sun - like star at different times does not have direct observational constraints , with the exception of the present sun .",
    "the temporal evolution of the euv flux adopted in this work is from @xcite , which was derived by scaling the euv flux with the temporal evolution of the stellar flux in other wavelength ranges .",
    "the accuracy of this method is approximately 10% - 20% @xcite .",
    "considering that the euv evaporation contributes typically less than 10% of the total mass - loss of a planet @xcite , the low accuracy of the euv fluxes at different times does not affect the statistical results .",
    "on the other hand , the stellar x - ray emissions are highly diverse @xcite .",
    "the ratio of x - rays to bolometric luminosity during the early saturated phase decreases from @xmath141 for late k dwarfs to @xmath142 for early f - type stars ( 0.29 @xmath143 @xmath144 1.4 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , our model is too deterministic because we use a fixed evolution track of stellar x - ray emission .",
    "m dwarfs can have strong chromosphere activities .",
    "they are very bright regarding hard radiation , which can strongly erode the planetary envelope .",
    "however , planets around k / m - dwarfs also have a less effective roche lobe effect @xcite .",
    "for planets surrounding f- , g- , k- , and m - type stars , @xcite show that evaporation can only remove a limited portion of the initial gas giant envelopes , and only neptunian and terrestrial planets are significantly affected by evaporation .",
    "we combine models of hydrodynamic atmospheric escape with planet population syntheses which include both planet formation and evolution .",
    "our global planet formation model is constructed based on the core accretion paradigm .",
    "we find that atmospheric escape adds characteristic features to the radius distribution of the synthetic planetary populations .",
    "the most interesting imprints are an `` evaporation valley '' in the radius - distance diagram and a bimodal planet size distribution ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "these features are consequences of evaporation , but their properties are also related to the characteristics of the initial planet population , and thus the planet formation process .    in our synthetic populations , the initial envelope fraction of low - mass planets with sizes of less than 4 @xmath0 is normally @xmath5 10% ( especially for planets at small distances ) .",
    "the initial mass fraction of planetary envelopes also scales with the planetary core mass and is typically @xmath5 5% for earth - size planets with a 1 @xmath91 core . due to their low gravity ,",
    "such very low - mass planets are sensitive to evaporation and are evaporated to bare cores with radii of about 1 @xmath0 at sufficiently small orbital distances .",
    "however , planets with larger core masses also have larger envelopes , as typical for the core accretion paradigm . at the end of evolution ,",
    "such more massive super - earths or neptunian planets retain at least a portion of their h / he envelopes .",
    "they will have substantially larger radii because already 0.1% in mass of h / he significantly increases the radius .",
    "the threshold core mass where a complete loss of the initial h / he envelope occurs decreases with orbital distance .    as a result",
    ", an  evaporation valley \" running diagonally downward in the orbital distance - planetary radius plane appears .",
    "it separates bare cores from planets retaining some primordial h / he .",
    "as the process of losing the last , e.g. , 0.1% of h / he occurs on a short timescale , the valley is sparsely populated with planets at any given moment at late times ( e.g. , 5 gyrs ) . at this time",
    ", the evaporation valley runs diagonally downward from about 2 @xmath0 at 0.06 au to 1 @xmath0 at 0.5 au .",
    "corresponding to this valley , the one - dimensional radius distribution of close - in low - mass planets is bimodal , with a local maximum at about 1 @xmath0 , a local minimum at about 1.5 @xmath0 and another maximum at 2 - 3 @xmath0 .",
    "the lower maximum in the bimodal distribution corresponds to the bare cores of planets that have lost their entire initial h / he envelope .",
    "the minimum corresponds to the  evaporation valley \" .",
    "the second maximum corresponds to low - mass planets that have kept some primordial h / he .",
    "no such very prominent features ( deep diagonal evaporation valley and strong depletion at about 1.5 @xmath0 in the radius histogram ) can be seen in the @xmath1 data for @xmath145 , even if a small local minimum might be present also in the observational data @xcite . this difference could be due to the following reasons :      -second , in our formation model , all low - mass planets start with a primordial h / he envelope and reach their final mass during the presence of the gaseous disk . in reality , at least some terrestrial planets will reach their final mass only after the dissipation of the gaseous nebula through a series of giant impacts , as likely for the earth itself .",
    "this population of  late \" planets is not expected to start with a significant h / he envelope ( a few percent ) , and therefore will not exhibit the imprints of evaporation ( no significant radius evolution in time ) .",
    "such planets would fill in the valley . for such planets ,",
    "the transition from solid planets to planets with h / he should likely not be a clear function of the semi - major axis , in contrast to the case that the transition is due to evaporation as studied here .",
    "this is an important constraint for formation models .",
    "-third , the composition of the bare cores might be different than in the model here : in our synthetic populations , the sizes of the bare evaporated cores range between 1.0 and 1.2 @xmath0 because all of the low - mass planets within 1 au have rocky cores with a zero ice fraction despite orbital migration included in the formation model : they only migrate within the iceline . if the migration of individual planets is more efficient than assumed here , or if more massive planets push lower - mass planets closer - in due to capture in mean motion resonance in multiple systems ( neither included here ) , planets that have formed beyond the ice line may migrate to close - in orbits during the formation stage .",
    "such planets will accrete high amounts of ice during formation and , hence , have a large , icy core . in a forthcoming paper ,",
    "we use a synthetic planet population with icy planetary cores to show that the sizes of the bare icy cores will be significantly larger and that these bare icy cores can fill in the minimum at @xmath146 .",
    "thus , if close - in planets have both rocky and icy ( or mixed ) cores , this can lead to an approximately flat radius distribution for @xmath147 , as observed in the bias - corrected radius distribution of the @xmath1 sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , a diversity in the core composition combined with the consequences of evaporation may provide an explanation for the observed radius plateau to 2 - 3 @xmath148 and the decrease at larger radii .",
    "clearly , the ice content of close - in low - mass planet is another fundamental constraint for formation ( migration ) models .",
    "the specific shape and location of the second maximum at 2 - 3 @xmath0 in the bimodal distribution ( planets that have retained primordial h / he ) is related to envelope evaporation .",
    "stronger evaporation produces a lower outer maximum and moves the peak to smaller radii .",
    "most of our evaporation models lead to a similar outer peak , which is approximately consistent with the size distribution of the @xmath1 candidates in the radius range of about 2 - 8 @xmath0 .",
    "however , in two extreme cases , the noev simulation without any evaporation and the b04 simulation with very strong evaporation ( 100% heating efficiency ) , the final planet size distribution shows clear differences compared with the @xmath1 data in this range .",
    "this indicates that evaporation is indeed important in shaping the characteristics of close - in , low - mass planets @xcite . for the comparison of observations with predictions of formation model for such planets",
    ", it should therefore be taken into account .",
    "other major findings are as follows : we find that in contrast to the radius distribution , the mass distribution of the entire planet population is barely affected by evaporation at @xmath149 0.06 au : low - mass planets may lose all h / he , but its initial mass fraction is low anyway .",
    "giant planets in contrast do not lose much h / he in our nominal evaporation model - their high mass gravity protects them .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of the core mass using a parameter study that is similar to the study described in @xcite .",
    "we confirm the evaporation threshold in the @xmath15 versus distance@xmath16 plane @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find that this evaporation threshold is also apparent in the mass - radius relationship of close - in planets . for the simulations that include evaporation , the mass - radius relationship clearly contains a threshold , and the very low - mass , very low - density planets that are initially above the threshold will lose at least a portion of their envelopes until they are below this threshold . finally , the impact of the grain opacity in the outer radiative zone of protoplanets during the formation stage on the mass - radius relationship at 5 gyrs remains clear also with evaporation .",
    "our study shows that several important observational constrains can be inferred from the comparison of observational results and theoretical formation and evolution models that include atmospheric escape .",
    "this is of high interest in view of several future high - precision photometric missions like tess @xcite or cheops @xcite .",
    "our results in particular show a dynamical evolution of the planetary population in terms of the radii ( or composition ) in time . in principle , such a temporal evolution could be observed directly with plato 2.0 @xcite which determines the ages of the host stars .",
