    "recent discoveries of non - oxide superconductors @xcite with respectably high transition temperatures , @xmath2 , and pairing mechanisms more complex than an isotropic , single - band , phonon - mediated one , have revitalised interest in intermetallic superconductors and promoted detailed studies of relatively simple binary and ternary materials , in particularly those containing alkaline earths or light elements , that did not get enough attention in the past due to complex synthesis , air sensitivity , or were just overlooked .",
    "the existence of binary srsn@xmath0 phase was suggested about 30 years ago @xcite but only recently @xcite the crystal structure was solved and superconductivity ( @xmath3 k ) was discovered .",
    "thus srsn@xmath0 is the most recent addition to the alkaline earth - stannides group of superconductors ( for srsn@xmath4 , basn@xmath4 and basn@xmath5 the superconducting transition temperatures are @xmath6 k @xcite , @xmath7 k @xcite , and @xmath8 k @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "srsn@xmath0 crystallizes in the orthorhombic structure ( @xmath9 space group ) with a unique sr site and three different sn sites . of the physical properties , only low temperature and low field magnetization measured on a polycrystalline sample",
    "were reported so far @xcite .    in this work we report growth of single crystals of srsn@xmath0 and measurements of their thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "both the superconducting and normal states were characterized .",
    "the relevant results are compared with the band structure calculations .",
    "single crystals of srsn@xmath0 were produced by traditional solution - growth methods.@xcite elemental sr and sn were placed in a 2 ml alumina crucible ( with the ratio of 3.5 : 96.5 ) .",
    "a second , catch crucible , containing silica wool was placed on the top of the growth crucible and sealed in a silica ampoule under approximately 1/3 atmosphere of argon gas .",
    "it should be noted that the packing and assembly of the growth ampoule was performed in a glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "the sealed ampoule was heated up to 800@xmath10 c over several hours , then cooled to 370@xmath10 c , and slowly cooled to 260@xmath10 c over 36 h. at this temperature , the crucible was removed from the furnace and the remaining liquid was decanted .",
    "the crystals grow as elongated blades or rods of a few mm length and sub - mm the two other dimensions .",
    "the crystals are air - sensitive , and have to be kept in the nitrogen glovebox .",
    "an effort was made to minimize the exposure to air in the process of handling and shaping the samples for the thermodynamic and transport measurements .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction data on both non - oxidized and oxidized sample were collected by a rigaku miniflex diffractometer with cu k@xmath11 radiation at room temperature .",
    "the diffraction pattern of the non - oxidized srsn@xmath0 was taken from the powder of srsn@xmath0 single crystals that were ground in a glovebox .",
    "the sample powder was sealed by kapton film during the measurement to protect it from oxidization .",
    "the same powder was used for the oxidized x - ray diffraction after a seven - hour exposure to the air .",
    "temperature- and magnetic field - dependent dc magnetization was measured using a quantum design mpms-5 squid magnetometer .",
    "electrical resistance was measured in a quantum design ppms instrument using a conventional four - probe geometry .",
    "platinum wires were attached to the sample using epotek h20e silver epoxy with the current flowing approximately along the longest dimension of the crystal ( @xmath12-axis ) .",
    "the epoxy was cured in air at 120@xmath10 c for @xmath13 min .",
    "this procedure resulted in some surface oxidation , but seems to preserve the structural integrity and electrical current continuity for the resistance samples .",
    "heat capacity was measured in a ppms instrument using a relaxation technique .",
    "low field dc magnetization under pressure up to @xmath14 kbar was measured in mpms-5 using a commercial , hmd , be - cu piston - cylinder pressure cell @xcite with daphne oil 7373 as a pressure medium and superconducting pb as a low temperature pressure gauge @xcite .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) on the non - oxidized sample confirms that the synthesized crystals are srsn@xmath0 with @xmath9 structure .",
    "the obtained lattice parameters are @xmath12 = 4.625(2 )  ,   @xmath15 = 17.384(6 )   and @xmath16 = 7.077(3 )  , consistent with the literature data @xcite .",
    "a few lines from residual sn flux are also visible . in contrast , the diffraction peaks of srsn@xmath0 all disappear in the oxidized sample s diffraction pattern , leaving only sn peaks , with their intensities remaining basically unchanged ( fig .",
    "these results imply that the oxidation of the powdered srsn@xmath0 results in the phase that is too small or disordered to diffract .    temperature dependent resistivity data for srsn@xmath0 are presented in fig .",
    "since the sample was of somewhat irregular shape , the data are presented normalized to the room temperature value .",
    "the room temperature resistivity , to within factor of two , is approximately 200 @xmath17 cm .",
    "the resistivity data show metallic ( @xmath18 ) behavior with rather high residual resistivity ratio , @xmath19 k@xmath20 k@xmath21 . the superconducting transition , with an onset at @xmath22 k ,",
    "is clearly seen in the data .",
    "anisotropic temperature - dependent dc susceptibility , @xmath23 , is shown in fig .",
    "normal state , high field susceptibility , is paramagnetic and anisotropic , with @xmath24 in the whole temperature range .",
    "anisotropic @xmath25 measured at 5 k is close to linear , possibly with small para- or ferromagnetic contribution that saturates by @xmath26 koe at @xmath27/f.u .",
    "the temperature dependence of the susceptibility is somewhat surprising .",
    "the high temperature part of the anisotropic @xmath28 in principle can be fitted with a modified curie - weiss law , @xmath29 , ( resulting in rather large , @xmath30 , effective moment and large , negative , order of -200 k , values of @xmath31 ) . at this point",
    "we have doubts that such local - moment - like picture has any merit .",
    "more work is required to determine if this temperature dependence is intrinsic and what is the mechanism behind it .",
    "superconductivity with the onset of @xmath32 k is clearly seen in the low field zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) susceptibility data , figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] , ( no corrections for demagnetization factor were employed ) . to infer an anisotropic upper superconducting critical field for srsn@xmath0 ,",
    "a set of low field zfc susceptibility measurements were performed ( see figs . [ f4],[f5 ] ) .",
    "a criterion of @xmath33 was chosen for the upper critical field .",
    "alternatively , anisotropic @xmath34 can be evaluated from the shifts of resistively measured superconducting transitions in different applied magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "[ f45a ] ) . onset and offset criteria are used for the resistivity data ( fig . [ f45a](a ) ) .",
    "the resulting anisotropic @xmath34 curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . as it often the case , @xmath35 criterion agrees quite well with @xmath36 criterion for magnetization .",
    "albeit different measurements and criteria give somewhat different @xmath34 curves , several features are observed in all of them .",
    "a distinct upward curvature is clearly seen for both orientations ( this upturn is particularly sharp in onset resistivity data ) .",
    "this feature might be a signature of multiband superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the upper critical field of srsn@xmath0 is rather small , clearly below 10 koe at @xmath37 .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath38 is rather small , it does not exceed @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath34 curves from magnetization and offset resistive data are similar . taken together these data suggest that this material might have complex superconductivity and/or superconducting @xmath40 phase diagram .",
    "it has to be noticed that @xmath2 and the superconducting critical fields found for srsn@xmath0 in this work are significantly different from that for elemental sn used as flux ( @xmath41 k , and @xmath42 oe ) , which rules out traces of sn flux in the crystals as the source of the superconducting behavior @xcite .    the low temperature heat capacity of srsn@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "a 10 koe applied field is enough to completely suppress superconductivity ( fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) without changing the normal state properties . from the low temperature , in - field , heat capacity data ,",
    "the sommerfeld coefficient for srsn@xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath43 mj / mol k@xmath44 , and the debye temperature @xmath45 k. the superconducting transition is clearly seen in zero - field heat capacity data .",
    "the jump at @xmath2 is @xmath46 mj / mol k@xmath44 that gives corresponds to @xmath47 this value is higher than the canonical 1.43 value expected for isotropic weakly coupled bcs superconductor and suggests that srsn@xmath0 is a strongly coupled superconductor @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath48 behavior in the superconducting state ( fig . [ f7 ] , lower right inset ) appears to be non - exponential and reasonably well described by @xmath49 function .",
    "if intrinsic , such dependence might point to deviations from isotropic single band superconductivity for this material .    the superconducting transition temperature of srsn@xmath0 linearly decreases under pressure up to @xmath50 kbar ( fig .",
    "the pressure derivative @xmath51 k / kbar , is rather small , similar in sign and order of magnitude to those measured for a number of elemental and binary superconductors @xcite .",
    "such pressure dependence is possibly the result of rather weak dependence of the density of states on energy near the fermi level as well as possibly opposing changes to @xmath2 caused by shift in the phonon spectrum by hydrostatic pressure .",
    "+ the electronic structure calculation has been done within generalized gradient approximations of density functional theory using the quantum espresso package @xcite.we have employed plane - wave basis set and ultrasoft pseudo - potential @xcite and the perdew , wang @xcite exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) summations were carried out over a 16x16x8 bz grid with gaussian boarding 0.02 ry in self - consistent calculation and summation over tetrahedrons for electronic density of states calculation .",
    "the plane wave energy cut off at 30 ry allows an accuracy of 0.2 mry / atom .",
    "the calculated density of states ( dos ) is presented in fig .",
    "similar to the results published in @xcite , the fermi level ( @xmath52 ) is located near the edge of a local maximum and close to local minimum",
    ". however the local minimum is less pronounced compared to lmto results @xcite .",
    "the value of dos at @xmath52 ( @xmath53 st / ev cell ) is pretty high and the corresponding @xmath54 mj / mol k@xmath44 .",
    "comparison with the experimental value , @xmath55 , yields the value of the enhancement factor ( due to electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions ) @xmath56 , that appears to be comparable to the enhancement observed in alkali metals due to electron - phonon interactions @xcite the almost equal distribution of total dos between all atoms in the compound points to strong hybridization of valence electrons ( that might contribute to the value of @xmath57 ) .",
    "the detailed analysis of character of electrons bonds have been provided in @xcite .    according to the calculations , a fermi surface ( fs ) of srsn@xmath0 is formed by multiple sheets formed by four bands ( fig .",
    "[ f10 ] ) .",
    "the fs topology is complex : bands 4 and 7 give contribution in form of a number of rather small , distorted , ellipsoids , whereas bands 5 and 6 contribute to the fs in the form of multiply - connected `` monsters '' .",
    "there appears to be no dominating low - dimensional , cylindrical , fs parts .",
    "the small @xmath38 anisotropy is consistent with this three - dimensional fs .",
    "similarly , no profound anisotropy in the electrical transport is expected .",
    "detailed thermodynamic and transport measurements were performed on single crystals of srsn@xmath0 with @xmath58 . the normal state magnetic susceptibility is paramagnetic and slightly anisotropic .",
    "srsn@xmath0 can be characterized as strongly - coupled three dimensional superconductor with @xmath59 k , and the upper critical field of the order of 2 koe .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath38 does not exceed 1.5 and is slightly temperature - dependent .",
    "@xmath2 decreases slowly under hydrostatic pressure up to @xmath60 kbar .",
    "the heat capacity and @xmath34 data suggest that superconductivity in this material may be more complex than isotropic bcs .",
    "band structure calculations of the dos at @xmath52 are consistent with experimental observations , suggesting the strong hybridization of valence electrons and yielding three - dimensional fermi surface with multiple sheets originating from four bands .",
    "since srsn@xmath0 crystals have high @xmath61 and easily accessible @xmath2 , detailed studies of the symmetry of the superconducting state by low temperature thermal transport and/or penetration depth measurements could be of interest .",
