    "in its simplest formulation , the black hole information paradox @xcite follows from the statement that black hole radiation @xcite is precisely thermal , with the temperature depending just on the conserved charges defining the black hole .",
    "given that there is an exponentially big number @xmath3 of initial states that could collapse to the given black hole , where @xmath4 is the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite , it is concluded that after the black hole has evaporated the information about the initial state is lost .",
    "mathematically , the paradox arises since under unitary evolution of the initial quantum state , we can never produce a thermal ensemble , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an appropriate gibbs distribution for the problem at hand .",
    "interestingly , this problem is strikingly similar to one old problem in quantum mechanics , the problem of ` quantum thermalization ' , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the problem of quantum thermalization can be easily stated as :    * in the context of microscopic unitarity , and given  ( [ iloss ] ) , how can gibbs ensembles emerge ?    in what follows we will assume the hilbert space to be factorizable : @xmath7 the number of factors in  ( [ hilbert ] ) is unconstrained , it can be finite or infinite . besides , the hilbert space factors do not need to be equal to each other . if the algebra of operators acting on @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , with @xmath10 a discrete parameter",
    ", the algebra of operators acting on @xmath11 is @xmath12 reduced subalgebras / subsystems @xmath13 are defined by specifying a set of hilbert factors , and considering non - unity operators only in those subfactors : @xmath14 as is well known , given a unitarily evolving pure state @xmath15 , the expectation value of any operator belonging to such subalgebra @xmath16 is completely characterized by its associated reduced density matrix : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the complement subalgebra / subsystem of @xmath16 .",
    "although perfect thermality can not be attained within unitary evolution , we might still expect certain approximate thermality for the correlation functions of the theory .",
    "the condition stating that all measurements  ( [ evolvedoperator ] ) are approximately thermal @xmath20 can be more rigorously stated as @xmath21 with small errors , and where @xmath22 is the reduced thermal density matrix associated to @xmath16 .    given these preliminaries , some immediate questions concerning quantum thermalization are :    * what is the corresponding @xmath6 for the specific theory and state @xmath23 considered ? or equivalently , how the parameters defining @xmath6 are related to the parameters defining @xmath23 ? *",
    "how does the error scale in the thermodynamic limit ?    considering  ( [ thermality ] ) and the previous questions , one modern approach to tackle this problem is to compute the entanglement entropy of the reduced subsystem @xmath16 , which is defined by @xmath24 if our state is such that relation  ( [ thermality ] ) holds , the next insightful relation follows as well : @xmath25 which states that the origin of thermal entropy in quantum mechanics lies in quantum entanglement .",
    "the discussion has been until now entirely generic .",
    "to proceed we should take a specific hamiltonian @xmath26 and find the exact evolved quantum state : @xmath27 this is certainly a difficult task , since we are usually interested in high energy states , with many particles excited .",
    "but due to these complicated dynamics , we expect that some approximations can be done .",
    "in particular , one common procedure is to assume that after a certain time we can approximate the evolved state as a _ _ random vector _ _ : @xmath28 which can be equivalently thought as being created by the application of a random unitary matrix to a given initial state : @xmath29 the question now is obvious :    * how do we define @xmath30 or @xmath31 ?",
    "if we could answer this question generically for any theory and initial state , it would allows us to compute typical values of physical quantities in a unitary framework .",
    "the physical quantities in which we are interested in this article are the typical reduced density matrix of a given subsystem @xmath16 , given by @xmath32 and the typical entanglement entropies @xmath33 this approach was pioneered in @xcite . in those articles",
    "a bipartite hilbert space was considered , with dimension @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the dimensions of the corresponding factors of the total hilbert space . for this hilbert space ,",
    "@xmath30 was defined by averaging over the continuum manifold of quantum states @xcite , with a constant measure , i.e the haar ensemble of quantum states in the full hilbert space .",
    "again , this is equivalent to applying a random unitary @xmath31 picked from the haar ensemble of random unitaries . with this specific definition of randomness in the given hilbert space ,",
    "the typical reduced density matrix  ( [ typicalreduced ] ) was found in @xcite and , using those results , the typical entanglement entropy  ( [ typicalentanglment ] ) was found in @xcite . in the light of the previous questions about quantum thermalization , their results for this specific case are the following :    * the typical reduced density matrix of a subsystem @xmath16 is proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "therefore , this reduced density matrix might be associated to the thermal density matrix of any hamiltonian ( defined for the finite dimensional hilbert space ) in the infinite temperature limit . *",
    "the error depends on the size of both subsystems @xmath16 and @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the error in formula  ( [ entanglementthermal ] ) is of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the total entropy of the system . for @xmath41",
    "the error is of @xmath42 .",
    "the first bullet point expresses the fact that unitary evolution _ typically _ leads to thermal behavior , with an infinite temperature density matrix for this specific case .",
    "the second point expresses the deviations from thermality , showing that the error size when @xmath38 is exponentially suppressed .",
    "this result has been used repeatedly in the past to argue against the hawking information paradox @xcite , since the available computations of correlation functions during black hole evaporation are insensitive to the _ expected corrections _",
    ", of @xmath43 if we trust the previous random approximations .",
    "we remark here , see @xcite for recent reviews and references therein , that the intuition coming from the random unitaries / states framework has had a strong impact in the context of black physics and quantum thermalization , given a plethora of new concepts , problems and solutions .",
    "but we believe that the framework deserves further development , since its present status has also deficiencies .",
    "firstly , the random unitary framework has not been formulated generically in the context of qft .",
    "secondly , the random unitary evolution defined in @xcite does not conserve any charge , such as energy , momentum , electric charge , etc .",
    "besides , the framework just provides a gibbs distribution with infinite temperature .",
    "it is then interesting to ask the following questions :    * can the framework be generalized systematically so as to include conservation of any given charge ?",
    "* can it be formalized in a qft context ? * can non - infinite effective temperatures emerge in the framework ? *",
    "do the deviations from thermality differ from the previous case ?    in this article",
    "we develop a framework to solve these questions , and which has interesting different potential applications .",
    "we summarize the results here .      the natural answer for the first question",
    "is not to choose the haar ensemble of random unitaries / states , but to choose the appropriate ensemble of unitary matrices conserving any given set of charges .",
    "the problem with this approach is to construct such an ensemble , and we do not see a systematic way of doing so . in this article",
    "we will use the haar ensemble in an appropriate subspace of the hilbert space , defined by the given initial charges .",
    "this procedure can also be seen as implictly defining an esemble of random unitaries different from the haar ensemble in the full hilbert space . within this framework",
    "we will provide generic formulae for the typical reduced density matrix and entanglement entropy of any given subsystem and for any given set of conserved charges .",
    "these objects turn out to be written generically in terms of ` constrained multiplicities ' , number of different configurations with a given set of constraints .",
    "the results connect in a direct and transparent way modern approaches of quantum information theory , concerning for example the computation of entanglement entropies , with more traditional frameworks of microstate counting .    for the second question we argue that the natural way to generalize the framework to a qft context is to use the fock space formalism .",
    "fock space provides an ideal setup to define the appropriate subspaces corresponding to the given set of conserved charges . besides , it is also an ideal setup to define partitions / subsystems by tracing out different set of particles .",
    "one possibility is to integrate out all momentum modes but a given one , as done in @xcite for the case of vacuum states .",
    "we can also integrate out positively charged particles , left movers of a cft , etc .",
    "interestingly , the formulas we find in the case of random states are generic for all types of subsystems .    for",
    "the third and fourth questions we need to sacrifice generality of the analysis and choose concrete models in which to apply the developed formulas .",
    "we choose the simplest but non - trivial cases , in which many things can be computed analytically : a massless scalar field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions and its generalization to the case of @xmath0 scalar fields . for a given initial total energy , we derive the typical density matrix and prove that in the thermodynamic limit it is equal to the thermal density matrix .",
    "it turns out that the effective temperature is finite , and depends on the initial energy in the way expected from usual thermal considerations . in this way",
    "we are able to derive the equation of state of the qft directly from random dynamics .",
    "the equation of state is seen as the typical macroscopic configuration of an underlying unitary quantum model .",
    "we also compute the deviations from thermality , obtaining an important insight .",
    "as commented before , for the so - called page case , developed in @xcite , the typical density matrix is _ exactly _ the thermal distribution withouth the need of taking the thermodynamic limit , and the deviations of the typical entropy from the entropy of the typical reduced density matrix are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this means that deviations from thermality are exponentially supressed , see appendix  [ app1 ] for a complete discussion of all cases . on the other hand ,",
    "as we will show , in the qft context the typical density matrix and thererefore the entanglement entropy of the typical density matrix are not directly equal to their thermal counterparts , the difference being of @xmath44 . therefore , to compute the leading deviations from thermality we just need to compute the entanglement entropy of the typical density matrix , a feature which will simplify matters in future developments . from other perspective , our results pinpoint the microcanonical ensemble as the right ensemble to use when considering pure state unitary evolution .    at any rate ,",
    "the important upshot is that the errors expected in a scenario in which some charges are conserved are much bigger than the ones commented before , being of @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "the applications of these results to conceptual problems involving black holes is still unclear and deserves further development . at any rate it is interesting that",
    ":    * the corrections affect directly the diagonal entries of the density matrix , and therefore should be seen in observables such as mode occupation numbers .",
    "they are not non - perturbative , and should be visible in the first @xmath44 corrections . * for any qft , deviations from thermality can be computed exactly within our framework , and it would be interesting if this can guide the computations of these corrections directly from black hole geometric considerations .    at the end of the article we speculate on potential applications of this framework to the relation between geometry and entanglement @xcite",
    ". in particular , our framework can compute entanglement entropies for any desired subsystem , and it is imaginable that we could get important insights into the emergence of near horizon regions through entanglement in the field theory . in previous literature there has been problems with the ` integration out ' procedure of high momentum modes , or the so - called ` holographic renormalization ' , when trying to get to the near horizon region of black hole backgrounds , and therefore only the asymptotic region is well understood .",
    "it seems that our framework may overcome such difficulties in the specific context of random evolution , and might teach us important lessons about event horizons , stretched horizons and near horizon regions of black holes .",
    "our initial quantum state will be a pure quantum state within a fock space , which is the natural basis of qft and certain spin systems : @xmath46 the notation works as follows .",
    "labels @xmath47 denote the number of particles in a given representation .",
    "labels @xmath48 specify the representation . for example , in a certain theory we could have @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the momentum , @xmath51 the spin and @xmath52 some charges labelled by @xmath53 . as usual",
    "we assume that the fock states in ( [ fock ] ) are attached with a total conserved energy @xmath54 and total conserved charges @xmath55 of the free theory , where @xmath53 label different possible charges . finally , when there is no need to write all the previous labels we will use greek letters @xmath56 to simplify notation .",
    "they are just natural numbers running over the states .",
    "for example , normalization of the basis vector is expressed as @xmath57 .",
    "we now follow the logic described in the introduction .",
    "consider that the full interacting hamiltonian of the system @xmath26 commutes with the total charges , so that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are conserved .",
    "if we begin with an initial fock space state @xmath58 , with definite values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the various charge conservation laws force the unitary evolution of the initial state to be of the following form : @xmath59 where the sum does not run over all fock states ( [ fock ] ) , but only for those @xmath60 with definite values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . by definition",
    "there are @xmath61 of those , i.e the microcanonical number of states for a given total energy and total charges .      with ( [ ensemble ] )",
    "we can now ask questions about typical properties of the field theoretic state @xmath65 . for example , the average of the _ global _ density matrix is given by @xmath66=[\\vert \\psi_{\\textrm{out}}\\rangle   \\langle \\psi_{\\textrm{out}}\\vert]=\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{\\alpha=\\omega ( e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r})}\\frac{1}{\\omega ( e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r})}\\vert\\alpha\\rangle\\langle\\alpha\\vert\\;,\\ ] ] which is just the microcanonical density matrix for a theory with a generic number of conserved charges , obtained here in a straightforward manner by applying random dynamics in the appropriate subspace .",
    "random dynamics seem to pinpoint the maximally mixed microcanonical state , instead of the canonical ensemble .",
    "the next natural step , given the structure provided by fock space , is to choose one particle type , say @xmath49 , and integrate out all the others .",
    "notice that the case of momentum space entanglement , analyzed in @xcite for vacuum states , is going to be seen here as a special case , arising when we consider all types of particles within a specified momentum shell .",
    "but otherwise the fock space formalism provides naturally more possibilities , such as the entanglement between positively charged particles and the rest , particles with a given spin and the rest , left and right movers of a cft , etc .",
    "all possible types of sets and reduced dynamics within the fock basis of the hilbert space are constructed by joining the appropriate set of @xmath48 conforming the type of subsystem we want to study .",
    "we thus begin with the simplest one , given by one particle type @xmath67 .",
    "we first write the state in the following form @xmath68 so that now @xmath69 represents all other particle types different from @xmath67 , but the sum still runs over the previously specified subspace .",
    "the reduced density matrix is @xmath70 this is directly a diagonal density matrix , without the need of averaging . indeed , for a subsystem with one particle type @xmath67",
    ", it just happens that for two states @xmath71 and @xmath72 with the same energy and charge , they must obey @xmath73 .",
    "it will no longer be true for subsystems with more than one particle type . using  ( [ ensemble ] )",
    "we can obtain the typical reduced density matrix @xmath74&=&\\sum_{i_{a}=0}^{i^{\\textrm{max}}_{a}}\\frac{\\omega ( e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a})}{\\omega ( e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r})}\\vert i_{a}\\rangle\\langle i_{a}\\vert \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i_{a}=0}^{i^{\\textrm{max}}_{a}}p(e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a})\\vert i_{a}\\rangle\\langle i_{a}\\vert\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the number of states with energies @xmath54 , charges @xmath55 , and a fixed number @xmath76 of particles of type @xmath67 .",
    "the maximum value of the number of particles of type @xmath67 is denoted by @xmath77 and needs to be determined case by case .",
    "we discuss this in the example presented in the next section .    with the previous density matrix , the average entanglement entropy of a particle of a given type @xmath67 , in the fixed @xmath54 and @xmath55 sector",
    "is given by : @xmath78=-\\sum_{i_{a}=0}^{i^{\\textrm{max}}_{a}}p(e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a})\\log p(e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a})\\;.\\ ] ] being rigorous this is the entanglement entropy of the average density matrix , usually denoted by @xmath79)$ ] .",
    "the full average entropy is computed in appendix  [ app1 ] , where we show that the difference between the two is exponentially suppressed in the microcanonical entropy .",
    "the entropy of the typical density matrix will be enough for us , since we are not interested in the deviations between the typical entropy and the entropy of the typical density matrix , but instead , on the deviations from _ thermality_. in the usual case of @xcite , typicality and thermality turn out to be exactly the same , and therefore deviations between thermal entropy and average entanglement entropy are equal to deviations between average entanglement entropy and entanglement entropy of the average ( see appendix  [ app1 ] for the complete discussion ) .",
    "we will show that when conserved charges are taken into account this is not longer true .",
    "the leading deviations from thermal entropy are those already accounted for by the entropy of the average density matrix , a feature which simplifies present and further developments . at any rate , if needed , the full computations are described in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "relations  ( [ typicaldensity ] ) and are generic formulas which turn out to be written just in terms of ` constrained multiplicities ' , the number of different states with a given set of constraints .",
    "notice that the result for the entanglement entropy is finite , and no divergences occur , even taking into account that we are dealing with quantum field theories .",
    "this is obviously because we are carefully applying conservation of charges .",
    "although the multiplicities might be difficult to compute in general , there might be a class of theories in which they can be computed , and explicit connections with thermal density matrices ( in particular generalized gibbs ensembles ) might be established .",
    "we do this in the following section for the case of certain scalar field theories . at the same time the generality of  ( [ typicaldensity ] ) and  ( [ entropy ] )",
    "suggests there might be a generic way to prove that the probabilities @xmath80 are well approximated by the generalized gibbs ensemble .",
    "also it would be interesting to compute this multiplicities for integrable theories . in those theories generalized gibbs ensembles",
    "are expected to govern the dynamics but deviations from them might be bigger .",
    "this might aliviate several problems encountered in previous literature , see @xcite .",
    "we leave these interesting paths for future work .    generalizing the procedure to include",
    "any desired subset of particles is straightforward .",
    "we first form the set of @xmath81 in which we are interested , and write @xmath65 as : @xmath82 where @xmath69 now labels all particles types different from @xmath81 .",
    "the reduced density matrix then reads : @xmath83 where @xmath69 labels the set of particles which are traced out . as opposed to the previous one - particle case ,",
    "this is not a diagonal density matrix . ] .",
    "however , taking the average we find the following generic formula : @xmath84&=&\\sum_{i}\\frac{\\omega ( e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c})}{\\omega ( e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r})}\\vert i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c}\\rangle\\langle i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c}\\vert = \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{i}p(e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c})\\vert i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c}\\rangle\\langle i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c}\\vert\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is diagonal .",
    "the average probabilities @xmath85 are ready to be compared with thermal expectations , i.e with probabilities coming from gibbs distributions .",
    "we will discuss examples in the next section .    the average entanglement entropy - i.e. the entanglement entropy of the average density matrix ( see appendix [ app1])- is finally @xmath86=-\\sum_{i}p(e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c})\\log p(e_{\\textrm{t}},q_{\\textrm{t}}^{r},i_{a},i_{b},\\cdots , i_{c})\\;.\\ ] ] we concldue that the generic equations and apply to any theory with a fock basis structure , such as a qft or certain spin systems .",
    "in particular it is applicable to holographic field theories .",
    "it seems a rigorous framework to study entanglement between infrared and ultraviolet domains at finite temperature .",
    "an exciting possibility is that we could potentially extract physics from the near horizon regions of quantum black holes from the structure of entanglement in fock space of the field theory . at any rate it is expected to give more insights into the connections between entanglement and quantum gravity @xcite , an exciting direction which we leave for future work .",
    "in this section we analyze in detail two specific examples .",
    "the first example is a massless scalar field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions defined on a finite line segment .",
    "the second one is its generalization to the case of @xmath0 scalar fields . for both cases",
    "we will show the emergence of gibbs distributions as effective states for reduced subsystems .",
    "the procedure also allows the computation of deviations from precise thermality .",
    "finally , entanglement entropy for single modes as a function of the momentum , and entanglement between high and low energy momentum modes for a given energy cutoff will be discussed .",
    "we will end with the analogue of page curve @xcite for the case at hand .",
    "this enlarges the program spelled out in @xcite to the case of random states .      in this case",
    "the energy / momentum dispersion relation for excitations over the vacuum , together with the quantization condition reads @xmath87 for a segment of length @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the fock space is spanned by vectors of the type : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of particles with momentum @xmath92 , and @xmath69 is just a natural number running over all the infinite but countable eigenstates , used here to simplify notation .",
    "these are eigenstates of the free hamiltonian with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "if the true hamiltonian conserves the total energy , which for a fock state reads @xmath93 where @xmath94 is defined by @xmath95 , then any initial state with definite total energy @xmath54 will evolve towards states of the form @xmath96 where the @xmath97 are all the states belonging to ( [ fockstates ] ) with total energy @xmath54 . by definition these are @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the microcanonical entropy at energy @xmath54 . noticing that ( [ energyscalar ] ) can be written as @xmath100",
    "we conclude that the number of states with a given @xmath54 is equal to the number of different partitions @xmath101 of the natural number @xmath102 , which is given asymptotically for large @xmath94 by @xmath103 the global entropy can now easily be extracted and for large @xmath94 we find @xmath104 so , in the limit @xmath105 , this agrees with the cardy formula for a cft with central charge @xmath106 and @xmath107 . if the interacting theory would be a conformal theory on a line segment of length @xmath88 , the conformal dimension of the pure state @xmath108 would then be @xmath109 .",
    "we now study the entanglement entropy in a pure state of a single particle specie . in our example , choosing one particle type just amounts to choosing a definite momentum @xmath92 for a fixed @xmath112 .",
    "the momentum cell can still be multiply occupied , so the subsystem has a finite dimension determined by the size of the cell , i.e. @xmath113 , where the maximum occupation number is given by @xmath114 , the integer closest to @xmath115 from below .",
    "writing the state in the form @xmath116 where @xmath69 now represents all other particles types different from @xmath92 , we arrive at @xmath117 this is directly a diagonal density matrix , due to energy conservation .",

    "this number can be analytically computed .",
    "the procedure is explained in detail in appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "here we just quote the result : @xmath121 where @xmath101 is the number of partitions of the number @xmath112 .",
    "now we are ready to make the first crosscheck of our computations , which constitutes one of the main results of the article .",
    "the typical probability of finding @xmath91 particles with momentum @xmath92 is given by @xmath122 it is easy to check that all probabilities add up to unity .",
    "the leading term when @xmath123 , or equivalently @xmath124 , is given by @xmath125 this is a thermodynamic limit .",
    "indeed , @xmath123 means that the energy in momentum cell @xmath112 is small compared to the total energy , or equivalently , momentum cell @xmath112 is not well occupied .",
    "this implies that most of the energy is sitting in the other momentum cells , and that these cells form a heat bath for momentum cell @xmath112 .",
    "another way of saying this , is that this limit is a good approximation for low values of @xmath112 . for higher values of @xmath112 , the energy in this momentum cell",
    "will typically be too large , or @xmath126 will be too small for the thermodynamic limit to be a good approximation .",
    "if we would have used the usual gibbs ensemble this probability would be given by @xmath127 so in the limit @xmath123 , of for cft s , large conformal dimensions @xmath128 , the pure state is typically seen by the momentum cell as a thermal bath at a temperature given by @xmath129 we thus see that it is possible to derive generic gibbs ensembles , with any desired effective temperature , using random dynamics in the approppriate subspace .",
    "notice that implies @xmath130 on the one hand , and on the other hand there is the general relation @xmath131 . combining the two",
    ", we can determine the pressure density : @xmath132 this is the same equation of state as for a two - dimensional cft .",
    "in this way we expect to recover the known relation @xmath133 , valid for @xmath134-dimensional cft s , using just random dynamics",
    ". more generically it should be possible to derive any equation of state by choosing the appropriate field theory and using the same procedure .",
    "the equation of state of a fluid system , at least for this case , is the typical macroscopic configuration of the true evolving pure quantum state .",
    "the next step is to compute the deviations form thermality .",
    "the next to leading term in the previous @xmath123 expansion is given by @xmath135 to proof this , we only needed the hardy - ramanujan asymptotic formula for the number of partitions , see in appendix [ app2 ] .",
    "the error we find here is thus much bigger than the one is usually expected . within the usual random unitary formalism ,",
    "the errors are typically of @xmath45 , so exponentially suppressed in the entropy . in our case , if we take a momentum cell with energy @xmath136 , we are finding errors of @xmath137 .",
    "this seems just to be due to energy conservation , which is explicitly ensured in our formalism .",
    "that we find such large errors may have implications for black hole physics and bulk locality in ads / cft , see @xcite and references therein , and we address this issue further in the next subsection when we discuss the large @xmath0 limit .",

    "the situation becomes more cumbersome when evaluating the entanglement entropy , since we now have to perform additional sums over multiple occupation numbers . in practice",
    "this turns out to be rather hard using mathematica , and we only succeeded to evaluate the entanglement entropy of a system of up to the first eight modes .",
    "however , a simplification occurs whenever @xmath159 , namely when the subsystem has much smaller energy then the total energy .",
    "notice that if @xmath160 , then we can approximate the partitions @xmath161 which we can use in the probabilities . indeed , if @xmath162 holds , we can apply to all terms in  ( [ probn ] ) , so that we obtain @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the probability given by the gibbs ensemble .",
    "one can again compute the subleading corrections , using for each term in and find power - law suppressed terms in the energy of the subsystem divided by the total energy .",
    "so the error analysis is similar to the case of a single momentum cell , and the leading corrections scale like @xmath1 .",
    "hence for any subsystem , up to computable corrections , the entanglement entropy associated to @xmath165 is just the sum of thermal entropies of each momentum mode . in this way",
    "we can derive the analogous curve in a qft setup to the so - called page s curve @xcite .",
    "obviously , if we express the entanglement entropy as a function of the corresponding thermal entropy we obtain directly page s curve , with somewhat different deviations from thermality .",

    "this can either be seen from the asymptotic expansion of the dilogarithm , or by directly doing the integral @xmath175 we can also determine the thermal entropy of the complementary system , which we denote by @xmath36 , namely the system of momentum modes that lie between a given @xmath112 and @xmath176 .",
    "this is given by @xmath177 applying the previous continuum limit we can obtain also analytical formulas for the entropy of @xmath36 .",
    "the plot of the thermal entropy of subsystem @xmath36 is given in figure .",
    "the thermal entropies associated to @xmath35 and @xmath36 have different functional structures as we vary the subsystem sizes .",
    "given that the entanglement entropy of @xmath35 should be equal to that of @xmath36 it might naively seem there is a contradiction here .",
    "but indeed there is no contradiction , since the thermal entropy is a good approximation for the entanglement entropy of @xmath35 for values up to @xmath178 ( half the entropy ) , and for the entanglement entropy of @xmath36 for larger values of @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , what is meaningful here is the critical momentum mode @xmath92 for which the thermal entropy of the reduced subsystem is precisely half of the total entropy .",
    "this happens when the corrections to the first term in cancel between each other .",
    "remarkably , in the large @xmath88 limit , there is an exact solution of this , due to the identity of dilogarithms @xmath179 which we will use for @xmath180 and @xmath181 in . for these choices ,",
    "all other terms cancel except for the first one .",

    "they intersect exactly at @xmath189 , as depicted in figure [ page ] .",
    "as commented in the introduction , part of the reasons to generalize the random unitary framework to the context of quantum field theory is to get closer to the physics of black holes .",

    "equivalently , for high temperatures , the errors are small .",
    "there is a simple intuition behind this result , given the approximation in which we are doing the computations .",
    "as explained in appendix  [ app2 ] , to compute the microcanonical degeneracy @xmath224 for the case of @xmath0 fields , we need to perform a difficult sum over different partitions . to compute it",
    ", we use a saddle point approximation .",
    "the physics behind the saddle point approximation , expected to be valid for @xmath202 , is that the problem at hand is equivalent to @xmath0 single scalar field theories , each one with a total energy @xmath225 . in this approximation",
    "we can then use the results of the single field model with total energy given by @xmath226 .",

    "it is difficult to do the exact computations . but to see that thermal dynamics is still a good approximation , and compute the deviations from it , we can consider the specific case in which the total energy is given by @xmath230 .",
    "the only fock states with such an energy are the ones with one particle excited in the lowest momentum mode .",
    "there are @xmath0 of such states , one per field specie .",
    "therefore , using the previous random machinery , the typical reduced density matrix of the lowest momentum mode of a single field is given by @xmath231 this is just a mixed state , with probability equal to @xmath232 for specie 1 to be in the vacuum and probability equal to @xmath233 of having its lowest momentum mode occupied .",

    "one possibility is to match the first probability exactly , from which we obtain @xmath234 . with this effective temperature",
    "the other probability is given by @xmath235 .",

    "this might have interesting implications in the context of ads / cft @xcite .",
    "the regime we are working in corresponds to the black hole phase .",
    "indeed , the black hole corresponds to a highly excited state in the cft , so we require a large conformal dimension @xmath223 .",
    "furthermore , large central charge is required for the bulk theory to be weakly coupled , and finally , we require @xmath240 or @xmath241 to be well above the hawking - page transition point .    moving forward ,",
    "the average entanglement entropy of the single momentum mode @xmath242 is given by @xmath243 as stated before , this is a complicated sum for which we do not have a definite analytic expression .",
    "for the case of @xmath244 one can explicitly do the sum , since there are only two terms , @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "the result is @xmath247 where in the second line we took the leading term in the limit @xmath145 .",
    "we see that including more field species does not spoil the appearance of exponentially suppressed entanglement entropies in momentum space .",
    "we remark again that we find it very unprobable that geometric quantities , such as geodesic lengths , can capture such physics , since the minimum proper lengths are of @xmath42 in planck units .",
    "other aspects of the entropy behavior do not change drastically either from the single field case .",
    "this is easily observed by noticing that the thermal entropy of a given momentum mode , whatever the field specie , is left basically unchanged by the inclusion of more field species .",
    "the only change comes again by the total energy associated to a given field , and therefore the effective temeprature associated to each mode . for @xmath0 fields , the total energy given to one field is @xmath225 , and therefore the temperature @xmath248 decreases with @xmath0 as well .",
    "the deviations are given again by @xmath249 , as the previous probabilities themselves .",
    "integrating out all momentum modes higher than a certain critical momentum @xmath92 is also possible .",
    "the associated constrained multiplicity can be computed in the same way as the previous ones , and an analogous formula to  ( [ probn ] ) can be obtained .",
    "therefore , one can approximate the typical reduced density matrix with the gibbs ensemble in the same previous limit .",
    "we will not repeat the procedure here , since it is straightforward and those results are not affected by the inclusion of more fields .    besides , the analogous of page curve in this qft setup is not going to change either . to observe this , notice that up to subleading corrections in the thermodynamic limit , we can use the thermal entropy for the low - energy modes .",
    "this is simply the sum of the thermal entropies of the individual modes of every field specie @xmath250 where we remind that @xmath251 . due to the simplicity of the previous relation , the critical momentum @xmath92",
    "for which the thermal entropy of the reduced subsystem is precisely half of the total entropy does not change when considering @xmath0 fields .",
    "hence , the critical momentum dividing the qft in two halfs maximally entangled with each other is again @xmath252 giving a different interpretation to temperature in the qft .",
    "the use of random unitary dynamics is having a strong impact in the physics of black holes and in the context of quantum thermalization , see the nice recent reviews @xcite and references therein .",

    "this example was first studied in @xcite , in which the typical properties of reduced density matrices were derived .",
    "later , in @xcite , their results were used to compute the average entanglement entropy of a given subsystem .    in this article",
    "we have taken some steps towards generalizing the previous random unitary framework , so that it can be applied to any physical system and phase of it .",
    "we formulated the random unitary framework in fock space .",
    "if unitary evolution constrains the state of the system to live in a specific subspace of the hilbert space , defined by some set of charges , the typical properties of the subspace can be studied using the simple gaussian relations  ( [ constrainedevo ] ) and .",
    "this gaussian ensemble is not precisely the haar ensemble , but deviations between both of them are exponentially suppressed . indeed , just with those gaussian relations we were able to rederive the old results of @xcite in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "formulating the problem in fock space makes the study of reduced dynamics very natural .",
    "generically one can choose any subset of particles , charcaterized by several quantum numbers , and integrate out all the others .",
    "the main results of the article are equations  ( [ typicalreducedsubset ] ) and ( [ entanglementsubset ] ) .",
    "these are generic formulas for the typical reduced density matrix and the typical entanglement entropy associated to it .",
    "they are valid for any desired subsystem in any theory .",
    "they are written just in terms of ` constrained multiplicities ' @xmath253 , i.e. the number of configurations with a given set of constraints . in this way",
    "we connect modern approaches to quantum thermalization concerning quantum information theory , and in particular quantum entanglement , with more traditional microstate counting apporaches .",
    "the standard deviations of both formulas are computed in appendix  [ app1 ] . for the case of entanglement entropy",
    "we developed a new method to compute the deviations .",
    "the method directly connects the differences between page s curve and the exact thermal answer to the well - known wigner s semicircle law for the eigenvalue statistics of the ensemble of gaussian unitary matrices ( gue ) , see appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "this is very satisfactory , since it connects in a transparent way the more traditional approach to quantum chaos provided by random matrices and gaussian ensembles , see @xcite for a nice introduction to the subject , to more modern approaches based on entanglement entropy .",
    "finally we applied the generic formulas for a massless scalar field theory in a finite segment , and for its generalization to the case of @xmath0 field species . in this context",
    "we arrived at the following results :    * we showed the emergence of gibbs dynamics with the correct effective temperature as a function of the total energy of the state .",

    "* the typical density matrix is not equal to the thermal density matrix , but to the microcanonical density matrix .",
    "both are seen to be equal just in the strict thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a huge difference with the old model described in @xcite , in which typicality is equal to thermality . *",
    "the deviations from thermality are of @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 .",

    "the smallest ones are of @xmath254 . in the context of holography",
