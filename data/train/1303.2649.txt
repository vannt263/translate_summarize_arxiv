    "advances in detection techniques and recent exoplanet surveys have discovered terrestrial planets in the habitable zone ( hz ) of their parent star @xcite and it is expected that this number will greatly increase as time passes @xcite .",
    "classically , the hz is defined as the circumstellar region in which a terrestrial mass planet ( @xmath13 ) , with favorable atmospheric conditions , can sustain liquid water on its surface @xcite .",
    "currently , more than 800 extra - solar planetary systems have been detected , and @xmath14 additional candidate systems from the _ kepler _ mission are waiting to be confirmed @xcite .",
    "one of the primary goals of _ kepler _ mission is to determine @xmath15 , the frequency of earth - size planets in and near the hz of solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "such estimates have been made for potentially rocky planets using both radial - velocity ( rv , @xcite ) and _ kepler _ data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many other studies have estimated in general the terrestrial planet frequency @xcite and the consensus from these studies is that there are more low mass / smaller radii planets than high mass / larger radii ones .",
    "moreover , the frequency increases towards lower radii , larger orbital periods @xcite . the estimates of the occurrence rates of terrestrial planets with periods @xmath16 days ranged from @xmath17 @xcite around gkm stars using rv , to @xmath18 @xcite around m - stars using transit detection .",
    "specifically , to estimate @xmath15 , one needs to know the boundaries of the hzs .",
    "some studies did estimate this number for m - dwarfs using transit ( @xmath0 , @xcite ) and rv ( @xmath12 , @xcite ) surveys . @xcite estimated @xmath15 to be @xmath19 for _ kepler _ fgk stars , but this is based on an extrapolation of data for planets with orbital periods shorter than 42 days .",
    "these estimates of the occurrence rates were based on 1-d radiative - convective , cloud - free climate model calculations by @xcite .",
    "several other studies @xcite parametrized @xcite results to estimate relationships between hz boundaries and stellar parameters for stars of different spectral types .",
    "moreover , no uniform criterion of hz limits were followed in applying them to calculate the occurrence rates , which can lead to comparing quantities that are not similar .",
    "for example , for the outer edge of the hz , some studies @xcite used the first @xmath20 condensation limit and others @xcite used early mars criterion .    recently @xcite obtained new , improved estimates of the boundaries of the hz by updating @xcite model with new @xmath21 and @xmath20 absorption coefficients from updated line- by - line ( lbl ) databases such as hitran 2008 @xcite and hitemp 2010 @xcite .",
    "they estimated that , for our sun , a conservative estimate of the inner hz ( ihz ) is at @xmath22 au and the outer hz ( ohz ) is at @xmath23 au .",
    "these values represent the `` water loss '' ( moist greenhouse ) limit at the inner edge and `` maximum greenhouse '' limit at the outer edge .    @xcite",
    "have also estimated hz boundaries around other stellar spectral types , including m stars , which are primary targets for ongoing surveys such as _ habitable zone planet finder _",
    "* hpf ) and mearth @xcite to discover potential habitable planets .",
    "furthermore , m - dwarfs are also increasingly becoming important as _ kepler _ targets to find terrestrial size planets : the planetary orbital periods around these stars are shorter , the transit signal is larger , and there is a greater chance of detecting these planets than there is around a sun - like star .",
    "although m - dwarfs are fainter , the hzs are also closer for m - dwarfs , so it is likely that potential habitable planets may be discovered around nearby m - dwarfs in the near future with space - based characterization missions .    in this study , we apply @xcite hz limits to estimate the occurrence rate of terrestrial size ( @xmath6 r@xmath2 and @xmath9 r@xmath2 ) planets in the hz of m stars .",
    "we base our analysis on @xcite who updated stellar parameters of 3897 low mass _ kepler _ target stars with temperatures below @xmath24 k using darthmouth stellar evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ sec2 ] we will revise @xcite calculations with new hz estimates of @xcite , discuss the implications in  [ sec3 ] and conclude in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "from @xcite and @xcite , the planet occurrence rate over a given period ( @xmath25 ) and radius ( @xmath26 ) range is given by :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the semi - major axis of planet @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the host star s radius of planet @xmath29 , @xmath31 is the number of stars around which planet @xmath29 could have been detected and @xmath32 is the number of planets with the radius @xmath26 and period @xmath25 . the ratio @xmath33 is the inverse of the probability of transit orientation , which is considered to take non - transiting geometries into the estimation of occurrence rate .    in table 2 of @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide stellar and planetary parameters of candidate kois that are considered to be in or near the hz . to estimate the occurrence rate , @xcite adopt the most conservative estimate of hz limits from @xcite results : the ` moist greenhouse ' for the inner hz ( 0.95 au ) and the beginning of the @xmath20 condensation for the outer hz ( 1.37 au for the sun ) .",
    "furthermore , they consider earth - size as planets that are in the radius range @xmath6 r@xmath2 . based on these definitions , @xcite consider two kois to be in the hz from their table 2 : koi 2626.01 and 1422.02 .",
    "they then calculate occurrence rate of earth - size planets in the hz as @xmath0 planets per star .",
    "this estimate may need to be updated , however , as the estimated width and the position of the hz has changed recently , following new calculation by @xcite . according to these authors ,",
    "hzs are farther out from their star than what has been calculated previously .",
    "this will have a significant effect on the occurrence rate derived by @xcite .",
    "also , the `` 1st @xmath20 condensation '' limit of @xcite , should now be disregarded , as it has been shown that @xmath20 clouds generally warm a planet s climate @xcite ) .",
    "here we use the @xcite hz limits to derive revised estimates of occurrence rates of potentially habitable planets around low - mass stars . in order to put a lower and upper bound on @xmath15",
    ", we calculate two values for the occurrence rate based on the conservative and optimistic estimate of hz limits as given in @xcite :    \\(1 ) in a conservative estimate , the inner edge of the hz is determined by the `` moist - greenhouse '' limit which is derived by assuming a fully saturated troposphere and negligible cloud feedback .",
    "neither assumption is likely true in reality , but it is difficult to improve on this with a 1-d climate model because such models can not accurately simulate clouds or relative humidity .",
    "the outer edge of the hz is determined by the `` maximum greenhouse '' limit where a @xmath20 dominated atmosphere can produce maximum amount of greenhouse warming . here also , the radiative warming by @xmath20 clouds is neglected hence the limit is a conservative estimate .",
    "\\(2 ) in an optimistic scenario , the inner edge of the hz boundary can be obtained by the `` recent venus '' limit which is based on the observations of venus by magellan spacecraft , suggesting that liquid water has been absent from the surface of venus for at least 1 gyr @xcite or earlier .",
    "the sun at that time was @xmath34 of the present day luminosity , according to standard stellar evolutionary models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table 2 ) .",
    "the current solar flux at venus distance is @xmath35 times that of earth .",
    "therefore , the solar flux received by venus at that time was @xmath36 times that of earth .",
    "this empirical estimate of the inner hz edge in our solar system corresponds to an orbital distance of @xmath37 au for the present day . note that this distance is greater than venus orbital distance of 0.72 au because the constraint of surface water was imposed when the sun was fainter .",
    "the outer edge optimistic estimate is the `` early mars '' limit based on the observation that early mars was warm enough for liquid water to flow on its surface @xcite . assuming the dried up riverbeds and valley networks on martian surface are 3.8 gyr old ,",
    "the solar luminosity at that time would have been @xmath38 of the present value ( see eq.(1 ) in @xcite and table 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the present - day solar flux at mars distance is @xmath39 times that of earth .",
    "therefore , the solar flux received by mars at 3.8 gyr was @xmath40 times that of earth .",
    "the corresponding empirical ohz limit for our solar system today , then , would be @xmath41 au .    the optimistic hz limits can be extrapolated to other stellar types with effective temperatures between @xmath4 k to @xmath42 k , by scaling them with the corresponding values of conservative hz limits , as shown in @xcite .    to derive new rates from eq.([rateeq ] ) , we need two quantities : ( 1 ) @xmath33 for the planets in the hzs and ( 2 ) @xmath31 , the number of stars around which a planet that has the same size and receives the same insolation as those kois in the hz could have been detected .",
    "the photometrically derived values of @xmath33 are given in table 5 of @xcite .",
    "but @xcite use the calculated @xmath33 determined from the period of the planet and mass of the star ( dressing , private communication ) .",
    "we use the @xmath31 values provided within the period - radii cells of fig .",
    "15 of @xcite , which gives the number of stars around which a planet from the center of the grid cell would have been detected with a signal to noise ratio above 7.1 @xmath43 .",
    "this should still give us nearly the same occurrence rate , or an underestimate of the actual value ( see next section ) .",
    "for example , for the two kois ( 2626.01 and 1422.02 ) that @xcite consider to be in the hz , when we use the center of the grid cell @xmath31 numbers ( 1822 and 872 ) from fig .",
    "15 of @xcite ( instead of the @xmath31 values provided in section 5.7 ) and use the period determined @xmath33 as they did , we were able to reproduce their value of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , our new occurrence rate ( which uses center of the grid cell numbers ) determined here probably is close to a value from a more rigorous estimate .",
    "we will first calculate @xmath15 using @xcite radius range of @xmath6 r@xmath2 .",
    "assuming conservative hz limits from @xcite , four kois from table 2 of @xcite should be in the hz based on the insolation fluxes ( fig.[koihz ] ) : koi 1686.01 , 2418.01 , 2626.01 and 1422.02 .",
    "we use the photometric @xmath33 from table 5 of @xcite , rather than the calculated @xmath33 from the period and stellar mass . for a typical planet candidate",
    ", the photometric @xmath33 is 85@xmath45 of the @xmath33 from the period and stellar mass .",
    "therefore , our value tends to be at the lower end of the occurrence rate estimate .",
    "the corresponding @xmath33 for these candidates from table 5 of @xcite are : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath31 values from center of the grid cells of fig.15 are : 353 , 994 , 1822 and 872 , respectively .",
    "using eq.([rateeq ] ) , we get the conservative estimate of @xmath15 for low - mass stars to be @xmath7 per star .    an optimistic estimate of the occurrence rate can also be derived based on the recent venus and early mars limit from @xcite results . assuming these limits , six",
    "kois from table 2 of @xcite should be in the hz ( fig.[koihz ] ) : koi 1686.01 , 2418.01 , 2626.01 , 1422.02 , 2650.01 and 886.03 .",
    "the corresponding photometric determined @xmath33 for these candidates from table 5 of @xcite are : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath31 values from fig.15 of @xcite are : 353 , 994 , 1822 , 872 , 1822 and 2336 . using eq.([rateeq ] ) , the optimistic estimate of the occurrence rate of earth - size planets in the habitable zones around low - mass stars is @xmath8 per star .    instead of assuming @xmath6 r@xmath2 as ` earth - size '",
    ", we will also calculate occurrence rate extending the radius range from @xmath9 r@xmath2 .",
    "planets with radius @xmath52 r@xmath2 are thought to have either homogeneous composition of water ice , silicate or iron or some differential composition of these compounds @xcite .",
    "this will then add koi @xmath53 in the conservative rate estimate ( the total number of kois in the hz is then five ) and koi @xmath54 in the optimistic rate estimate ( the total hz kois is eight ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath33 and @xmath31 for these additional candidates from @xcite table 5 and fig .",
    "15 are : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , for koi @xmath53 ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , for koi @xmath54 .",
    "using this expanded definition of earth - size ( @xmath9 r@xmath2 ) , a conservative estimate of the occurrence rate of earth - size planets in the hzs around m - dwarfs is @xmath10 per star .",
    "an optimistic estimate on the occurrence rate is @xmath11 per star .",
    "the occurrence rate estimates derived in the previous section indicate that terrestrial size planets in hzs around low - mass stars are more frequent than previously thought .",
    "couple of caveats are to be noted :    \\(1 ) the kois are not confirmed planets .",
    "the calculated false positive rates for _ kepler _ candidates in our relevant radius bin range from @xmath59 @xcite to @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may be overestimating @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainties on the fluxes are large ( fig .",
    "[ koihz ] ) , so some may not be in the hz ( 2 ) on the other hand , we use photometrically derived @xmath33 given in table 5 of @xcite .",
    "this may _ underestimate _ our occurrence rate because @xcite use calculated @xmath33 from orbital periods and stellar mass ( dressing 2013 , private communication ) and the photometric values are @xmath61 of the derived values .",
    "so the net effect from points 1 and 2 may not change significantly our estimate of @xmath15 .",
    "\\(3 ) as mentioned above , we do not calculate number of stars around which a planet that has the same size and receives the same insolation as the ones in the hz could have been detected ; we instead use the cell numbers from fig.15 of @xcite , which gives the number of stars around which a hypothetical planet that has the same radius and period as the center of the grid cell would have been detected with a signal to noise ratio above @xmath62 .",
    "there is no reason to assume that the kois considered here to be in the hz are at the center of the grid cell ( in fact , they are not ) .",
    "this offset probably overestimates our value of @xmath31 in eq.([rateeq ] ) .",
    "for example , in section 5.7 of @xcite , they calculate @xmath31 values of 2853 , 813 and 2131 for kois @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "these numbers are generally lower in value than the center of the grid cells values we use from fig.15 ( @xmath65 , respectively ) , except for koi 2626.01 ( an increase of @xmath66 ) .",
    "if this is the general trend , i.e , if we are overestimating @xmath31 systematically , then our calculated occurrence rates of terrestrial planets in the hz around m - dwarfs can be considered as a _",
    "lower _ bound to the actual value . nevertheless , we tested to see how much the rate would change if we change @xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath31 ( at same insolation ) is most likely smaller than @xmath31 ( at same period ) for the planet candidates in the hz because most of those planet candidates orbit stars that are cooler than the typical kepler m dwarf .",
    "since there is one koi ( 2626.01 ) for which we underestimate @xmath31 by @xmath67 , and could potentially decrease our occurrence rate estimate , we rounded off and added @xmath68 of the respective @xmath31 values to _ all _ the kois that are in the hz . after performing this calculation , for the radius range @xmath6 r@xmath2 , the conservative estimate changed from @xmath7 to @xmath69 per star .",
    "the optimistic estimate changed from @xmath8 to @xmath70 per star . in the extended radius range for earth - size ( @xmath71 r@xmath2 ) ,",
    "the conservative estimate changed from @xmath10 per star to @xmath72 , and the optimistic estimate changed from @xmath11 per star to @xmath73 . note that even though adding @xmath68 to @xmath31 lowers our occurrence rate , we are underestimating @xmath33 on an average of @xmath74 or more . furthermore , we showed that we were able to reproduce @xcite estimate even if we use center of the grid cell value for @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , a more rigorous analysis to determine the occurrence rate from @xcite would likely produce a similar result as our s .",
    "@xcite studied @xmath75 southern nearby m dwarfs using eso / harps spectrograph and obtained the frequency of terrestrial mass planets ( @xmath76 m@xmath2 ) in the hz to be @xmath12 .",
    "note that they consider two planets to be in the hz , gl 581d and gl 667cc , using optimistic limits of the hz ( recent venus and early mars ) from @xcite .",
    "if we use also use optimistic hz estimates , we find that both the planets are in the hz .",
    "our optimistic estimate of @xmath15 ranges from @xmath8 to @xmath11 per star , depending on if the mass range in @xcite is applicable to terrestrial sizes of @xmath6 r@xmath2 radius or @xmath9 r@xmath2 radius .",
    "nevertheless , our estimates of the occurrence rates of hz terrestrial planets around m - dwarfs are in good agreement with independently derived rv estimates , within the error bars .    .",
    "the green shaded region is the conservative hz .",
    "the optimistic hz limits are recent venus ( solid red curve ) and early mars ( solid blue curve ) .",
    "two of the terrestrial - size kois ( 1422.02 and 2626.01 ) that are in the @xcite hz are also shown.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "the purpose of our analysis is to outline the significant increase in the terrestrial planet occurrence rate in the hzs of m - dwarfs compared to @xcite .",
    "we have obtained revised estimates based on @xcite estimates of 3987 _ kepler _ m - dwarfs that are cooler than @xmath24 k in q1-q6 data . applying new hz results from @xcite to earth - size planets ( @xmath6 r@xmath2 )",
    ", we calculate that a conservative estimate of the occurrence rate of earth - size planets in the hzs around m - dwarfs is @xmath7 planets per star .",
    "the optimistic estimates indicate that the occurrence rate increases to @xmath8 planets per star . if we extend the definition of earth - size to planets in the radius range @xmath71 r@xmath2 , the conservative estimate increases to @xmath10 per star , and the optimistic estimate increases to @xmath11 per star .",
    "as discussed in our paper , our results probably are close or underestimate the actual occurrence rate of earth - size planets in the hzs around m - dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , our optimistic value of @xmath15 quoted above is in agreement ( within uncertainties ) with a similar estimate , @xmath12 , from @xcite eso / harps survey of 102 m - dwarf stars indicating that the frequency of terrestrial planets in the hzs of m - dwarfs may be higher than previously reported .",
