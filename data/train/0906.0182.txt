    "one of the fundamental no - go theorems in quantum mechanics is the no - cloning theorem @xcite , which states that unknown quantum states can not be perfectly copied . in other words ,",
    "no quantum mechanical evolution exists which would transform a quantum state according to @xmath1 for an unknown state @xmath2 .",
    "this theorem is a consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics , and it has tremendous technological implications ; e.g. , it is at the basis of the security of quantum communication protocols including quantum key distribution . although exact cloning is impossible , pretty good approximate cloning is possible as shown for the first time by buek and hillery @xcite .",
    "they designed a cloning machine , referred to as the @xmath3 _ universal cloner _ ( uc ) , which produces two approximate copies from an unknown pure qubit state .",
    "the uc is a state - independent symmetric cloner in the sense that all qubit states are cloned with the same fidelity @xmath4 and fidelities of the clones to the initial pure state is the same @xmath5 .",
    "the concept of cloning has attracted considerable interest , and it has been later shown that for the @xmath6 uc , the relation between the optimum fidelity @xmath7 of each copy and the number @xmath8 of copies is given by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath10 corresponds to a classical cloning machine with @xmath11 , which is the best fidelity that one can achieve with only classical operations .",
    "moreover , the concept has been extended to include cloning of qudits , cloning of continuous - variable systems or state - dependent cloning ( nonuniversal cloning ) , which can produce clones of a specific set of qubits with much higher fidelity than the rest @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to the latter topic .",
    "suppose we want to clone a qubit , which is in a pure state @xmath12 parametrized by polar @xmath13 and azimuthal @xmath14 angles on the bloch sphere . by considering only the @xmath3 cloning ,",
    "the joint density matrix of both clones can be given by @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a trace - preserving completely positive ( tpcp ) map describing the cloning operation in the tensor product of the input ( @xmath17 ) and output ( @xmath18 ) hilbert spaces .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 stands for partial trace over @xmath17 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 denotes transposition , and @xmath22 is the identity operator in @xmath18 .",
    "the quality of the cloning can be described by the single - clone fidelity @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reduced density matrix of the @xmath25th clone ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the map @xmath16 can be found by using an optimization procedure which maximizes the fidelity of the clones . in order to find a map @xmath16 , which makes clones of pure state qubits of the best possible quality using a partial knowledge about the states",
    ", one needs to maximize the average single - copy fidelity @xmath27 , \\label{n04}\\ ] ] which is an average over all possible input qubits defined by the distribution function @xmath28 .",
    "the study of state - dependent cloning machines is important as it is often the case that we have some _ a priori _ information on the quantum state but we do not known it exactly . using the available _ a priori _ information , we can then design a cloning machine which performs better cloning than the uc for some specific set of qubits .",
    "for example , if it is known that the qubit is chosen from the equator of the bloch sphere , then we know that @xmath14 can be arbitrary while @xmath29 .",
    "for such a case , the so - called _ phase - covariant cloners _ ( pccs ) have been designed @xcite , and they have been shown to be optimal providing a higher fidelity than the uc .",
    "fiurek @xcite studied the pccs with known @xmath30 from the full range @xmath31 $ ] and provided two optimal symmetric cloners ; one for the states in the lower and the other for those in the upper hemisphere of the bloch sphere .    in this paper , we assume less _ a priori _ information and construct an optimal @xmath3 symmetric cloner using the approach developed by fiurek @xcite .",
    "contrary to the works of fiurek , where the cloners are designed for known fixed value of @xmath32 , that is fixed @xmath0 component , we provide an optimal cloner for the qubits with known @xmath33 ( or , equivalently , @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , our cloner prepares two symmetric clones for any qubit with @xmath30 or @xmath35 .",
    "suppose that we are given a qubit prepared in a pure state @xmath36 , given by eq .",
    "( [ n01 ] ) , together with the expectation value of the observable @xmath0 , that is @xmath14 is arbitrary but @xmath13 is equal either to @xmath32 or to @xmath35 .",
    "our task is to find a @xmath3 cloning machine which prepares optimal approximate clones of the input qubit .",
    "the input qubits of interest are those lying along the intersection of two cones , which have the cone angles @xmath32 and @xmath35 , sharing the same apex with bloch sphere as shown in fig .",
    "thus , the qubits are from both the upper and lower hemispheres of the bloch sphere",
    ". we can consider the qubits from the lower hemisphere as the mirror images of those from the upper hemisphere or vice versa .",
    "therefore , we suggest to call this cloning machine as the _ mirror phase - covariant cloner _ ( mpcc ) and require that it satisfies the following conditions : ( i ) qubits in the upper and lower hemisphere are cloned with the same maximal fidelity , @xmath37 , and ( ii ) the sum of the fidelities of the two clones is the maximum attainable fidelity .    to derive the transformation we maximize the following functional : @xmath38 where @xmath16 is a positive map and @xmath39 given in terms of @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 . the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ n05 ] ) is based on the method described in ref .",
    "for the mpcc , @xmath44 distribution occurring in ( [ n04 ] ) is given by @xmath45 , \\label{n07}\\ ] ] in terms of dirac s @xmath46 function .",
    "moreover , subscript @xmath32 was added to indicate _ a priori _ knowledge about the input state .",
    "note that @xmath47 is equal to @xmath48 for the uc and to @xmath49 for the pcc . by defining a @xmath14-averaged fidelity for each of the clones ( @xmath43 )",
    "@xmath50 one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ n04 ] ) assuming eq .",
    "( [ n07 ] ) as @xmath51 ,   \\label{n09}\\ ] ] and this quantity is to be maximized .",
    "by contrast , @xmath52 $ ] was applied in the maximization procedure for the pcc . using the method given in eq .",
    "@xcite we derive map @xmath16 in the following form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are @xmath32 dependent . moreover , @xmath56 as required by trace preservation of the transformation , and @xmath57 as will be shown analytically in the following .",
    "using the kraus decomposition with @xmath16 , as described in @xcite , we find that one of the possible unitary implementations of the tpcp map can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "this result is confirmed by our numerical analysis .",
    "fidelity of the clones can be derived by making use of the unitary transformation ( [ n12 ] ) and the explicit form of @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "( [ n01 ] ) . after performing the calculations we derive @xmath60 where @xmath61 . for the transformation to maximize fidelity , i.e. , for all @xmath62 $ ] we impose @xmath63 from which we get four expressions for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 reaches the extremum values @xmath68=p\\left[\\pi- { \\rm acos } ( \\sqrt6/3)\\right]=2/3 $ ] and @xmath69 . only one of the solutions provides fidelity , which is as high as the one derived numerically .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 is given by @xmath70 and then @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "now the unitary transformation can be written as @xmath73 leading to the following reduced density matrices of the clones @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{n101a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , fidelity of the clones , @xmath75 , created by this transformation can easily be calculated as @xmath76 in fig .",
    "2 , this fidelity is depicted in comparison to fidelities for the optimal pcc and uc . as seen in fig .  2 , @xmath77 has two minima @xmath78 and a local maximum @xmath79 .",
    "the eigenstates of pauli @xmath0 matrix are cloned with the highest fidelity @xmath80 .    for better visualization of the cloned states generated by the optimal mpcc we depicted their bloch representation in fig . 3 in comparison to the corresponding representations for the other optimal cloning machines .",
    "specifically , the bloch vector @xmath81 of each clone is found to be @xmath82 ,   \\label{n103}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is in contrast to @xmath83 $ ] for the uc and to the bloch vector @xmath84   \\label{n104}\\ ] ] for the optimal pcc , where @xmath85 .",
    "actually , @xmath86 for @xmath87 can take any value in @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "this is because for @xmath87 any linear combination of the optimal pcc transformations for south hemisphere ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) and north hemisphere ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) is also optimal @xcite .",

    "( [ n14 ] ) , ( [ n17 ] ) , and ( [ n20 ] ) we derive @xmath98\\\\ \\label{n21 } & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that the eq .",
    "( [ n19 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath99 the eigenvalues of @xmath100 can be written in terms of fidelity and @xmath101 matrix elements as follows : @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "all the eigenvalues are double degenerate . moreover , the following equation is satisfied : @xmath104 therefore , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . since @xmath107 we see that @xmath108 , and hence @xmath100 is positive semidefinite .",
    "this statement completes the proof .",
    "we propose two quantum circuits , shown in figs . 4 and 5 , which implement the optimal mpcc by transforming the input state @xmath109 into @xmath110 the quantum circuit depicted in fig .",
    "4 performs the following transformation : @xmath111 where the superscripts indicate qubits for which the corresponding gate is applied .",

    "in addition , this circuit is composed of controlled not ( cnot ) gates , @xmath115 , and controlled hadamard gate , @xmath116 , which can be decomposed as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "\\label{n101d}\\ ] ]    = 9.5 cm    the basic idea behind the second quantum circuit , shown in fig .",
    "5 , is different .",
    "the circuit acts as follows .",
    "the two cnot gates in fig . 5 implement the standard repetition code , which , together with the not gate applied to third qubit , lead to @xmath119 . in our implementation",
    ", the basic gate @xmath120 gate corresponds to the evolution operator @xmath121 of a system described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath122 where @xmath123 is an effective coupling constant and @xmath124 are , respectively , the spin raising and lowering spin operators acting on the @xmath125th qubit .",
    "we refer to the system , described by eq .",
    "( [ n102 ] ) , as the equivalent - neighbor model @xcite .",
    "general solution of the schrdinger equation for hamiltonian ( [ n102 ] ) is known assuming any number of qubits and arbitrary initial conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in our special case of three qubits",
    ", one has @xmath126 where @xmath127 for both `` excitation '' numbers @xmath128 .",
    "note that @xmath129 .",
    "let us choose such that evolution time @xmath130 that @xmath131 for a given @xmath32 .",

    "the global phase factor @xmath138 is physically irrelevant and can be dropped . while the relative phase factor @xmath139 can be corrected by applying the double - controlled rotation gates ( see fig .",

    "= 9.5 cm    the equivalent - neighbor model of three qubits can be implemented in various ways . here , we shortly discuss a quantum - dot model proposed by imamo@xmath147lu _",
    "the model describes interaction of @xmath148 quantum - dot spins mediated by a single - mode cavity and laser fields . in our case , three semiconductor quantum dots , each with a localized single conduction - band electron , embedded inside a microdisk structure and addressed selectively by laser beams of frequency @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) and intensity @xmath151 to induce strong coupling of the electron spins to a single cavity mode of frequency @xmath152 .",
    "the energy spectrum of each dot is represented by three states : @xmath153 and @xmath154 representing the conduction - band electron spin states , while the effective state @xmath155 describes all valence - band levels of the @xmath125th dot .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , by applying the adiabatic elimination method of the valence - band levels and the cavity field , that the system can be described by the following effective interaction hamiltonian : @xmath156,\\label{n202}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is the effective two - dot coupling strength between the electron spins in the @xmath125th and @xmath158th dots being a function of frequencies , detunings ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) , intensities @xmath151 , and the dipole coupling strengths between the levels @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian apparently describes direct coupling between the spins of the @xmath125th and @xmath158th dots , but it should be stressed that in the real microscopic picture the coupling between the spins is only indirect via the cavity and laser fields . to realize the equivalent - neighbor model it is enough to ensure ( i ) the same detunings @xmath159 for all dots by adjusting the laser - field frequencies @xmath160 and ( ii ) the same effective coupling constants @xmath161 by choosing the proper laser intensities , @xmath162 and @xmath163 for the adequate frequencies @xmath160 and @xmath164 .",
    "thus , hamiltonian ( [ n202 ] ) reduces to eq .",
