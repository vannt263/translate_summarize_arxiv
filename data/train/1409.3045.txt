    "another finding is that the early- and late - type galaxies have different behaviors in the plot : ( i ) early - type galaxies have higher sfrs in each regions on average ; and ( ii ) late - type ones are more various in the star formation properties , especially for intermediate - strength bars ( @xmath20 @xmath0 0.2  0.4 ) .",
    "this may indicate that star formation is not a simple function of bar strength or bar - related factors , and it likely also depends on other factors @xcite .",
    "next , we compare the sfr densities and bar strength in the middle panel of figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "similar to sfrs , the correlation coefficients are less than 0.2 , indicating no clear trend of @xmath45 with @xmath20 .",

    ", we had expected some evidence for enhanced star formation activity towards stronger bars .",
    "however , we find that there are no clear trends of the star formation properties along bar strength , except weak dependence on the bars for sfrs and @xmath43@xmath44 in the bulges and global galaxies",
    ". some previous studies also derived similar results . using a control sample of disc galaxies , @xcite compared sfrs between barred and unbarred galaxies , and found that there is no correlation between bar length or bar axial ratio and the enhancement of the sfr .",
    "some earlier studies using far infrared emission as a proxy for sfr , also did not found definite evidence that stronger bars could result in higher sfrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but on the other hand , simulations indeed show that gas inflows driven by bars can enhance star formation activity in galactic central regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gas being transported to the center by bars is also found in observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , simulations prove that the efficiency of driving gas depends on bar strength , i.e. , stronger bars are able to transport more material at a faster rate than weak bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when focusing on different types of galaxies , we find that early - type galaxies have higher sfrs , but similar @xmath43@xmath44 and lower ssfrs compared with late - type galaxies.this may be due to the differing episodes of bar - driven gas inflow and star formation in galaxies with different types . in different episodes , there are likely differing bar stages , bulge mass , gas contents , and other physical conditions , all of which may contribute to this process @xcite . in late - type galaxies ,",
    "stellar bars tend to be short , and bulges are usually small if exist , this is likely the early stage of bar - driven evolution . in this episode ,",
    "the effect of bars are not pronounced , although there is sufficient gas in galactic disks . within the process",
    ", the gas is reserved in the bar and galactic central regions , and then star formation activity would take place there , resulting in the growth of the stellar bar and bulge , along with the galaxy morphology changing .",
    "therefore , we could expect the `` mature '' bars in early - type disks @xcite .",
    "however , the various trends of star formation properties with bar strength suggest that other process is at play in reducing bar effect : ( i ) massive bulges can dilute the bar nonaxisymmetric forces @xcite , thus some early - type spirals may have weaker of bars than late - type systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) the amount of gas content may be not sufficient after consumed by star formation in the previous process . using co observations",
    ", @xcite found that six early - type barred spirals have very little molecular gas detected in bars and nuclear regions due to consuming of star formation .",
    "therefore , early - type systems may have similar or lower @xmath43@xmath44 in their bars and central regions compared with late - type ones ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , these probabilities are likely the reasons why various star formation properties are associated with the intermediate - strength bars . in these bars",
    ", some may be in the development from weak to strong , and others with similar strength may be weakened by the massive bulges , although they were once strong .",
    "besides these factors , the difference between the time - scales of bar evolution and star formation can also contribute to the complex of the process @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the lifetime of large - scale stellar bars are long enough to allow multiple episodes of central star formation , which can interpret that why some early - type bulges have lower ssfrs ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .      as mentioned above",
    ", the bar - driven secular evolution is a complex process and is likely composed of a series of stages .",
    "there has been substantial progress in the scenarios of secular evolution based on simulation evidences and observational results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in the evolution process , numerous episodes of bar - driven gas inflow and star formation may take place , along with the growth , destruction , and re - formation of stellar bars @xcite .    in one simple scenario , various stages of evolution can also be divided based on the changing properties of star formation activity and gas content in galaxies . using properties of h@xmath8 emission in barred galaxies ,",
    "@xcite classified them into three main groups , in which h@xmath8 emission is mainly located in stellar bars , galactic central regions , and spiral arms , respectively .",
    "they suggested these groups as different stages of an evolution process , similar to the trend proposed by @xcite , but more detailed .",
    "based on the properties of circumnuclear gas and star formation , @xcite projected a possible picture of bar - driven dynamical evolution , where the evolution process of barred galaxies was divided into three stages ( i.e. , type i non - starburst , type ii nonstarburst , and circumnuclear starburst ) .",
    "in the three stages , large amounts of gas is transformed from stellar bars to galactic central regions step by step , along with the star formation activity in bars and central regions . to complement this picture ,",
    "@xcite supplemented a poststarburst phase , i.e. , type iii non - starburst , where the gas has been consumed by circumnuclear starburst , with no molecular gas in the bar region .",
    "given the above evolution pictures , molecular gas is transported from galactic disks to bulges though stellar bars , resulting the rearrangement of material in the three galactic structures . since star formation activity is correlated with the local gas density @xcite , the properties of star formation activity in bulges are likely associated with those in bars and disks .",
    "in addition , star formation activity in barred galaxies , especially in bulges , can change the galactic morphological properties ( e.g. , the asymmetry and concentration ) . to explore the correlations between them , we compared the star formation parameters of bulges , bars and disks in our sample .",
    "@xmath44 ( _ middle _ ) , and ssfr ( _ right _ ) in different structures : bar versus bulge ( _ top _ ) , bar versus disk ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the dotted lines in each panel mark the scales between the two structures from 10@xmath46 to 10@xmath15 , top to bottom with a step of one order of magnitude .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "[ fig8 ] ]    figure  [ fig8 ] illustrates the correlations between the sfrs , @xmath43@xmath44 , and ssfrs in three galactic structures , along with the ratio lines from 10@xmath46 to 10@xmath15 plotted .",
    "we find barred galaxies with more active star formation in bars tend to have more active star formation in bulges , with similar correlation between bars and disks .",
    "it is worth noting that most sfrs in bars are 0.1 to 10 times of those in bulges , while the ratios of @xmath43@xmath44 in bars and bulges are in the range of 0.01 to 1 , one magnitude lower than the sfr ratios .",
    "in addition , the sfr densities in disks are in general 0.01 times of those in bulges .",
    "the enhanced star formation in bulges indicates the effect of bar - driven internal evolution , which can make the morphological properties vary with star formation activity in galaxies .",
    "@xmath44 with the concentration index of sfr image .",
    "this plot is used as a criterion to quantify the different stages of an bar - driven evolutionary sequence ( marked with arrows from _ a _ to _ d _ ) . see text for detail .",

    "five galaxies are marked specially in the plot , they are mentioned in the text or studied in our previous works @xcite .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "[ fig9 ] ]    combining the above evolution scenarios and observational results , we derive a possible criterion to quantify the different stages of an evolutionary sequence in figure  [ fig9 ] . in this figure",
    ", we use concentration index of the global sfr in galaxy , c@xmath47 , and the ratio of @xmath43@xmath44 in bulge and in bar , @xmath48 , as the estimated parameters , and divide the parameter space to six fields ( from _ a _ to _ f _ ) as follows . + : @xmath48 @xmath3 1 , c@xmath49 4 + this field is likely the early stage of bar - driven gas flow , where a considerable fraction of the star formation activity are located in galactic outer disks , and bars have more active star formation than bulges .",
    "this stage is earlier than type i non starburst in @xcite , because most gas is still in the outer disks .",
    "+ : @xmath5010 , c@xmath49 4 + this is the second stage , where the gas density in bulges are higher than that in bars along with the gas inflow . galaxies begin to have higher active star formation densities in bulges than those in bars , while the ratio is not larger than 10 , and @xmath51 is still lower than 4 , indicating a non - negligible fraction of gas content is still in the disks .",
    "+ : 10 @xmath52 10@xmath53 + : @xmath5410@xmath53 + after most molecular gas has flowed into the galactic central regions , there are stages _ c _ and _ d_. field _",
    "c _ is earlier in the process , corresponding to the later stage of type ii non starburst in @xcite , where galaxies either have low sfr concentration @xmath51 , or have the ratio of sfr densities not high enough .",
    "then as the intense star formation activity take place in bulges , galaxies in _ d _ may have most of star formation activity concentrated in their central regions , and also consume most of gas there , similar to the stage of circurmnuclear starburst in @xcite .",
    "+ : 1 @xmath5510 , c@xmath56 4 + : @xmath571 , c@xmath56 4 + _ e _ and _ f _ have @xmath48 lower than 10 but c@xmath47 larger than 4 .",
    "there are very few galaxies located in the two fields . given our assumption ,",
    "galaxies with low @xmath48 are probably in the stages before circumnuclear starburst , where galaxies should have low sfr concentration . however ,",
    "if there are other factors at play ( such as galaxy interactions ) , which can promote the process of bar - driven gas inflow , large fraction of molecular gas can be concentrated in the bars and bulges of galaxies even when they are still in the early stage of bar - driven process .",
    "for example , ngc 6701 ( in field _ e _ ) , is apparent as isolated , but has been proved a produce of interactions based on its morphological and kinematical features @xcite .",
    "similarly , ngc 7798 in field _",
    "e _ may be also in galaxy pairs and is affected by interactions @xcite .",
    "the resulting stages for our sample are listed in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "it is noted that our scenario just presents a rough criterion with uncertainties .",
    "for example , ngc 7479 is located in stage _",
    "c _ in this scenario , while is suggested in the type i non - starburst evolutionary phase under the effect of a minor merger ( paper i ) .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "5.1 , bar - driven secular evolution is a complex process , and many factors may contribute to it . to resolve this issue ,",
    "more detailed observations and analysis of barred spirals are needed , along with statistical studies of large samples ( e.g. , using sdss barred galaxies , wang et al . in prep . ) .",
    "we present a study of bar - driven secular evolution from a sample of 50 nearby barred galaxies with weak and strong stellar bars . in this study",
    ", we characterize the bars using image decomposition , and estimate bar strength using ellipticity - based parameter @xmath20 . based on multi - wavelength photometry",
    ", we derive the properties of star formation activity in different stellar structures , and explore the correlations between these properties and stellar bars .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "we use the image - fitting code budda to perform a 2d decomposition of 3.6 @xmath14 m images in bar / bulge / disc components , and obtaine the structural parameters of stellar bars .",
    "most bars in our sample are detected less than 9 kpc , and the bars in early - type spirals are in general longer in physical and normalized lengths , and stronger in strength than those in late - type ones .",
    "we calculate the rotational asymmetry a and concentration index c@xmath31 to quantify the distributions of star formation activity and stellar mass in galaxies .",
    "these parameters are compared with bar strength , while no clear trends are found .",
    "we find that early - type galaxies have higher concentration index and lower asymmetry in both sfr and stellar mass distribution than the late - type ones .",
    "weak bars tend to associate with low concentrical star formation activity , while strong bars appear to have large scatter in the distribution of star formation activity .",
    "the correlations are explored between bar strength and sfrs , @xmath43@xmath44 and ssfrs in bulges and bars , as well as the global galaxies , while only weak positive trends are found between star formation activity in bulges and the bar strength along with large scatter .",
    "in addition , the early- and late - type galaxies have discernible differences in their sfrs and ssfrs , but have similar @xmath43@xmath44 .",
    "\\4 . comparing with previous studies",
    ", we suggest that the differing galaxy types , stellar mass distribution , and episodes of bar - driven gas inflow may contribute to the complex of the bar - driven secular evolution , which can interpret why there are no visual trends between the parameters of star formation and bar strength .",
    "5.we find evident correlations between the star formation activity in different galactic structures , i.e. , barred galaxies with intense star formation in bars tend to have active star formation in their bulges and disks , indicating the bar - driven process in galaxies .    finally , to quantify the different stages of the process , we derived a possible criterion using the ratio of @xmath43@xmath44 in bulge and bar , and the concentration index of the galactic global sfr as the estimated parameters . while uncertainties exist because of the contribution of other factors besides stellar bars , future works are needed to explore this issue .",

    "<S> stellar bars are important internal drivers of secular evolution in disk galaxies . using a sample of nearby spiral galaxies with weak and strong bars , we explore the relationships between the star formation feature and stellar bars in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that galaxies with weak bars tend to be coincide with low concentrical star formation activity , while those with strong bars show a large scatter in the distribution of star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> we find enhanced star formation activity in bulges towards stronger bars , although not predominantly , consistent with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that different stages of the secular process and many other factors may contribute to the complexity of the secular evolution . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , barred galaxies with intense star formation in bars tend to have active star formation in their bulges and disks , and bulges have higher star formation densities than bars and disks , indicating the evolutionary effects of bars . </S>",
    "<S> we then derived a possible criterion to quantify the different stages of bar - driven physical process , while future work is needed because of the uncertainties . </S>"
