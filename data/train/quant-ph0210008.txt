    "we can understand the above situation by noting that our initial state possesses momentum components in k - space above the barrier , which can be transmitted more effectively by the resonance window corresponding to the first top - barrier resonance .",
    "this is the origin of the fast tunneling response , given by the _ forerunner _ , mainly described by @xmath58 . in our example , the main contribution to the resonant term , @xmath58 , comes from the first top - barrier resonant state . however , depending on the distance @xmath54 , one may need to sum up over many terms to account for the complete wave function .",
    "the second type of response is given in a natural way by the maximum of the first peak of the probability density associated with the quasi - monochromatic contribution @xmath61 .",

    "( [ 3c ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ tf ] ) , that as time increases , the maximum of the _ forerunner _ , occurring at @xmath80 , diminishes at a rate proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "hence , for an increasing value of @xmath54 , the transient structure tends to a vanishing value .    .",
    "it is interesting to mention that in the case of opaque barriers , i.e. , @xmath82 , the resonant contribution @xmath58 may be much larger than the quasi - monochromatic contribution @xmath61 .",
    "this occurs even at quite large distances from the interaction region .",
    "figure [ widebar ] exhibits an example of this situation for @xmath83 nm and a distance @xmath84 nm from the potential .",
    "since the solution is normalized to @xmath85 and this quantity becomes very small for large @xmath36 , one sees that @xmath58 is several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath61 , depicted in the inset to that figure . clearly , as previously discussed , and exemplified in fig .",

[ timedom ] .",
    "we can see that the intensity of the transient structure diminishes as @xmath36 decreases .",
    "in fact , for the case of a barrier width @xmath90 nm , we observe that the _ forerunner _ disappears . however , as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ vanish ] , what happens is that both the resonant contribution , @xmath91 , and the interference term , @xmath63 , in eq .",
    "( [ 5c ] ) for the probability density , are not only overwhelmed by the monochromatic contribution @xmath92 but also almost cancel each other .",
    "similarly fig .",
    "[ vanishv0 ] shows that the _ forerunner _ also disappears by diminishing the barrier height @xmath93 , and again , as the inset shows , this occurs by the same reason as discussed in the previous case .",
    "the above results hold also for the _ time domain resonance _ ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath57 . from the above analysis",
    "one could argue that the existence of the _ time domain resonance _ , and hence of the _ forerunners _ , depends basically on a particular combination of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the next subsection",
    "we shall show that this is indeed the case .",
    "an interesting result of the analysis of the previous subsection , depicted by fig . [ tdx1000 nm ] , is that at very large distances from the interaction region the time evolution of the probability density @xmath79 is essentially given by @xmath61 and exhibits a well defined wavefront .",
    "as mentioned above , the wavefront propagates with approximately the classical velocity @xmath94 , as follows by direct inspection of the argument to the @xmath95function , given by eq .",

    "the above considerations lead us to the notion of _ delay time _ as discussed by bohm@xcite .",
    "he has argued that the main contribution to the transmitted probability density comes from values in the neighborhood of space , for which the phase of the wave function changes slowly with energy .",

    "the behavior of @xmath79 ( solid line ) is very different from that of the free contribution @xmath62 ( dashed - dotted line ) . as discussed previously the _ time domain resonance _",

    "the splitting of the solution observed at larger distances and longer times has yet not occurred .",

    "[ phasevsl ] that for thin barriers there is a positive _ delay time _ , and as @xmath36 increases , there is a transition to a negative _",

    "however , one finds by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ trascend ] ) , that such a transition is not possible for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , there exists a critical value of the opacity @xmath112 such that for @xmath1 , the transition does not occur .",
    "this situation corresponds to impose the limit @xmath113 in the solution to eq .",
    "( [ trascend ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath114 , and hence eq.([trascend ] ) becomes ,    @xmath115    the numerical solution to eq .",
    "( [ trascend2 ] ) yields the critical opacity @xmath116 . note that in addition to the potential parameters @xmath93 and @xmath36 , the opacity depends on the mass @xmath117 of the incident particle",
    "it turns out that this value of @xmath2 accounts for systems where the potential barrier is either too shallow or too thin .",
    "therefore , in the regime @xmath1 , only a positive _ delay time _ is observed .",
    "we have also found that @xmath2 plays an important role in the existence of _ time domain resonances _ and hence of _ forerunners_. in fact , we find that for systems where @xmath1 , no _ time domain resonances _ nor _ forerunners _ are observed .",
    "this behavior can be seen in figs .",

    "[ vanishv0 ] , the cases ( b ) and ( c ) corresponding to the potential heights @xmath118 ev , and @xmath119 ev , that refer , respectively , to the values of @xmath0 , 2.96 and 2.095 . in this case",
    "the disappearance of the _ forerunner _ occurs in the vicinity of the critical opacity @xmath2 .",
    "hartman has argued@xcite that the time it takes to a particle to traverse the classical forbidden region of a potential barrier , can be obtained from an analysis involving the _ delay time_. he referred to this quantity as the _ transmission time _",
    "@xmath120 , though nowadays it is often called _ phase - delay time_. it corresponds to the difference between the time at which a transmitted particle of momentum @xmath68 would leave the rear of the barrier , @xmath57 , and the time the same particle would arrive at the front of the barrier , @xmath121 .",
    "the _ transmission time _",
    "@xmath120 can be written as ( see eq .",

    "note that @xmath124 cancels out exactly the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ td ] ) .",
    "the idea of considering @xmath120 as the relevant time scale for tunneling through a classically forbidden region has been criticized by arguing that there is no physical justification for relating in a causative sense the free evolving peak and the transmitted peak through a barrier@xcite .",
    "our analysis of the time evolution of the probability density supports this criticism .",
    "indeed , as discussed in subsection a , along the transmitted region , the probability density may split into two structures evolving with different velocities .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phasevsl1 ] ( a ) , where we plot @xmath120 as a function of the barrier width @xmath36 ( solid line ) , and compare it with a plot of @xmath127 ( full squares ) measured dynamically at the barrier edge @xmath57 .",

    "the lack of agreement between the plots of @xmath120 and @xmath128 in fig . [ phasevsl1 ] ( a ) follows because the _ time domain resonance _ , the quasi - monochromatic contribution and the interference term are very close together , as exemplified in fig .",

    "the above times become independent of the barrier width , giving rise to the well known hartman effect . indeed at asymptotically large values of @xmath36 , @xmath120 goes as @xmath131 as follows by inspection of eq .",
