    "et al . _ in 2008 @xcite .",
    "our cnot , toffoli , and fredkin gates are compact , simple , and economic as the ancilla qubits , employed in @xcite , are not required , and only a single - photon medium is employed .",
    "the proposals for the toffoli and fredkin gates beat their synthesis with two - qubit entangling gates and single - qubit gates largely .",
    "the optimal synthesis of a three - qubit toffoli gate requires six cnot gates @xcite and five quantum entangling gates on two individual qubits are required to synthesize a three - qubit fredkin gate @xcite .",
    "all our schemes are deterministic and the qubits for the gates are stationary .",
    "the side leakage rate of a single - side cavity is usually lower than that of a double - side one @xcite .",
    "moreover , a qd is easier to be confined in a cavity than an atom @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have proposed some compact schemes for implementing quantum computing on solid - state electron - spin qubits in the qds assisted by single - side resonant optical microcavities in a deterministic way .",
    "based on the fact that the @xmath18-polarized and the @xmath19-polarized photons reflected by the qd - cavity contribute different phase shifts , the compact quantum circuits for the cnot , toffoli , and fredkin gates on the stationary electron - spin qubits are achieved by some input - output processes of a single - photon medium and some classical feed - forward operations .",
    "our proposals are compact and economic as the additional qd - spin qubits are not required and our schemes for implementing the multiqubit gates beat their synthesis with two - qubit entangling gates and single - qubit gates largely",
    ". the success probabilities of our universal quantum gates are 100% in principle . with current technology ,",
