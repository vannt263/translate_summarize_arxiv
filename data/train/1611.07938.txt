    "multiplex networks have become one of the most active area of recent network research @xcite mainly due to the fact that many real - world systems like public transport or social networks consists of many layers . after six years of studies we know much more about the structure and the function of multiplex networks @xcite .",
    "a lot of attention has been devoted to the analysis of various dynamics on multiplex networks , including diffusion processes @xcite , epidemic spreading @xcite and voter dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , there is still an open question how the number of levels influence the macroscopic properties of the system , such as dynamics of global variables , phase transitions or other emerging patterns . in order to find a general answer to this question systematic studies of various models",
    "are needed .",
    "however , one of the fundamental problems when dealing with models on the multiplex network is how to define the model on such a network , because usually there are several possibilities .",
    "for example , in case of models defined by hamiltonians @xcite inter - layer interactions can be introduced by the relations between the coupling constants . however , the results of the model can strongly depend on this inter - layer interaction .",
    "jang at al thoroughly analyzed the behavior of the ashkin - teller model in various types of inter - layer interaction , and presented a rich phase diagram containing three types of phase transitions ",
    "1st order , 2nd order , and mixed order . for the models defined by the transition probabilities , like the voter model",
    ", the threshold model @xcite or the @xmath0-ising model @xcite one way of defining interactions between layers is the adoption of so called ` and ` and ` or ` rules , proposed for the first time by brummitt et al . in @xcite where the generalized threshold cascade model @xcite on multiplex networks has been studied .",
    "authors introduced two kinds on nodes : ( 1 ) an ` or ` node was activated as soon as a sufficiently large fraction of its neighbors were active in at least one level , ( 2 ) an ` and ` node was activated only if in each and every layer a sufficiently large fraction of its neighbors were active .",
    "the concept of ` and ` and ` or ` rules has been recently adopted in the @xmath0-voter model with independence @xcite . for systems consisting only ` and ` nodes the phase transition becomes discontinuous for @xmath10 if the number of layers @xmath11 , @xmath12 for duplex , whereas for a monoplex such behavior is observed for @xmath13 .    the ising model has always played a very special role in the statistical physics .",
    "for the original ising model a continuous phase transition is observed for both the regular lattices as well as monoplex complex networks @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of network of network topology suchecki and hoyst observed a discontinuous phase transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it has been shown that a seemingly small modification of the kinetic ising model  in which a randomly chosen spin interacts only with its @xmath0 neighbors  leads to the surprising result on monoplex complete graph , i.e. a switch from a continuous to a discontinuous phase transition at @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we ask the same question that has been asked in @xcite , but this time within the @xmath0- neighbor ising model , namely `` how the additional level will introduce the type of the phase transition ? '' .",
    "analogously , as in @xcite we focus on trivial topology duplex clique .",
    "the experience gained from the @xmath0-voter model allows to predict that the switch from a continuous to a discontinuous phase transition will appear for a smaller value of @xmath0 in case of a duplex clique than for a monoplex .",
    "such a result would be also expected from the theory of equilibrium phase transitions , if the additional layer could be treated analogously to the additional dimension @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that our simple prediction fails in case of the @xmath0- neighbor ising model and results are exactly opposite . adding a second layer causes that only continuous phase transitions are observed for all values of @xmath0 . because for a monoplex clique a discontinuous phase transition is observed for @xmath2 and for a duplex cliques the phase transition is continuous",
    ", we expect that there is a intermediate topology for which a switch from a discontinuous to a continuous phase transition appears .",
    "therefore we investigate the q - neighbor ising model on a generalized topology of a partially duplex clique , parametrized by @xmath5 $ ] , which allows us to tune the network from monoplex ( @xmath6 ) to duplex ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "such a generalized topology , in which a fraction @xmath8 of all nodes appear on both levels , allows to estimate a critical value of @xmath9 at which a switch from continuous to discontinuous phase transition is observed .",
    "multiplex networks consist of distinct levels ( layers ) and the interconnections between levels are only between a node and its counterpart in the other layer ( i.e. the same node ) . * a duplex clique * is a particular case of a multiplex networks , which consists of two distinct levels , each of which is represented by a complete graph ( i.e. a clique ) of size @xmath14 . the same topology was consider to analyze the @xmath0-voter model with independence @xcite .",
    "levels can represent two different communities ( e.g. facebook and school class ) and are composed of exactly the same people  each node possesses a counterpart node in the second layer .",
    "analogously as in @xcite , we assume that each node possesses the same state on each level .    in the * partially duplex clique *",
    "only the fraction @xmath8 of @xmath14 nodes have a counterpart in the other layer , remaining nodes belong only to one community ( layer ) .",
    "this means that at each level we have @xmath15 duplex - type nodes and @xmath16 monoplex - type nodes , which means that in total the system consists of @xmath17 distinguishable nodes ; an example of such a topology is shown in fig .",
    "the fraction @xmath8 of individuals who are active in both layers was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the parameter @xmath8 can be interpreted as _ interlayer connectivity _ or the degree of _ structural multiplexity _ of the system @xcite",

    "it is convenient to use the concentration of up spins , which is related to the magnetization by the simple formula : @xmath46 the transition probabilities as a function of @xmath47 and model s parameters @xmath48 and @xmath0 have the following form : @xmath49 ^ 2\\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma^-(c , t , q ) = c \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{k = q } { { q \\choose k}(1-c)^{q - k}c^{k }   e(q , k)}\\right ] ^2\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : gamma1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50.\\ ] ]    for the average values of concentration we can also write the rate equation @xcite , which has the following form in the rescaled time @xmath51 : @xmath52 in the stationary state @xmath53 , which is equivalent to the condition that the effective force @xcite : @xmath54    .critical temperature for duplex cliques for first values of @xmath0 .

    "let us recall here that for the @xmath0-neighbor ising model on a monoplex clique the behavior is much richer : for @xmath61 and @xmath4 there is no phase transition , for @xmath1 the phase transition is continuous and for @xmath2 discontinuous @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath62 the hysteresis exhibits oscillatory behavior  expanding for even values of @xmath0 and shrinking for odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth to stress that the rule used here corresponds to the ` and ` dynamics @xcite which means that a change of a spin is possible only if both layers indicate the change . in case of the second rule ,",

    "a natural question that emerges here can be formed in the following way `` for which value of @xmath118 the transition becomes continuous ? ''",
    "the direct answer might be troublesome especially that one can expect a weak first order phase transition on a border between a first order and continuous phase transitions , analogously to the two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts models @xcite .",
