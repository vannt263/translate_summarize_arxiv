    "the well known ( linear- ) functional analysis fits in appropriately in the theory of linear smoothers . typically a smoother",
    "is designed to pass sequences that are samplings of functions with low frequencies with minimal distortion ( error ) , but to map high frequencies near to the zero sequence .",
    "the least squares norm is appropriate , for various other reasons , but also that such smoothers then map a element @xmath0 onto weighted averages of sequence elements in a `` window '' around @xmath0 , say @xmath1 .",
    "the linearity also ensures that sequences of elements that are generated identically , independently distributed from a very general symmetrical distribution @xmath2 , are rapidly mapped near zero due to the central limit theorem .",
    "when we want to smooth a sequence , we can choose to construct a convenient smoother that is a `` bandpass '' filter , and practically remove high frequencies .",
    "the design of such filters is done in a well established theory of digital filters .",
    "the book by hamming @xcite is well known and instructive . the essential background theory is fourier analysis .",
    "this works well because the basic trigonometric functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are eigensequences of linear operators , and the `` transfer function '' approximates with eigenvalues near one in the frequencies that are to pass , and eigenvalues near @xmath5 where the frequencies are to be reduced to near zero .",
    "low pass filters should therefore marginally distort sequences that are samplings of functions that have fourier expansions that converge fast .",
    "this is well known to be related to continuity of lower derivatives .",
    "discontinuities in low order derivatives result in slowly converging fourier expansions and the digital filters will remove the high frequencies , distorting significantly the sequence of samplings .",
    "a typical bad case is isolated impulsive noise added spuriously .",
    "this necessitates the presmoothing by nonlinear smoothers , of which the median smoothers , popularised by tukey , are well known .",
    "since eigensequence analysis is not natural , nor easily justifiable , for nonlinear operators the lack of a theory for analysis and design was considered to be difficult , if not impossible @xcite .",
    "design was generally essentially considered to be an art .    over the last twenty years",
    "a theory for nonlinear ( general ) smoothers , that is based on order structure and min / max operations , has been developed and demonstrated to be very consistent and useful , even able to explain most of the `` good '' behaviour of the ( related ) median smoothers , as well as their `` enigmatic '' behaviour .",
    "a monogram presenting the so - called @xmath6-theory and its motivation and development appeared in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on compositions of two types of smoothers @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "they are morphological filters with special properties .",
    "one of the powerful ideas resulting from this theory , was the development of nonlinear multiresolution analysis .",
    "this was done using the heuristic ideas from fourier analysis and wavelet analysis .",
    "it resulted eventually in discrete pulse transforms @xcite .",
    "these transforms may turn out to be as useful for vision as the fourier transforms are for hearing @xcite .",
    "when applications of wavelet transforms ( and fourier transforms ) are under discussion it is natural for understanding to consider samplings of `` band limited '' functions as ideal candidates for such decompositions , both for theoretical derivation and practical applications . for nonlinear decomposition",
    "there has been a lack of such a relation between the theory of real functions and the theory of the sequences that are samplings of these functions .",
    "generalising @xmath6-operators and the associated theory and concepts to functions is the first appropriate attempt towards establishing such a link .",
    "central in the @xmath6-theory for sequences are the class of locally monotone sequences @xmath9 defined as the sets of all sequences @xmath10 that have @xmath11 monotone for each index @xmath12 .",
    "we need to establish natural links between these classes and classes of real functions of which the sequences can be considered as samplings . also natural to @xmath6-theory is the total variation as norm @xcite .",
    "there is a clue to establishing links with standard real analysis , as is typically presented by royden in the first few chapters of his book @xcite .",
    "total variation of functions and local monotonicity are linked to the derivative in this theory . we seek to extend and solidify these links with established real analysis of functions . to do this we , look at the basic ideas of the @xmath6-theory for sequences @xcite .",
    "we start directly with the definitions of the `` atoms '' involved .    given a bi - infinite sequence @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined as follows @xmath15 in analogy with the above discrete lulu operators , for a given @xmath16 the basic smoothers @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the lulu theory are defined for functions on @xmath19 through the concepts of the so called lower and upper @xmath20-envelopes of these functions . these definitions are given in section 2 , where it is also shown that the operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 preserve essential properties of their discrete counterparts .",
    "in particular , the operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 generate through composition a fully ordered four element semi - group , also called a strong lulu structure , as opposed to the general weak @xmath6-structure of recursions and dilations , with a 6 element semi - group that is only partially ordered . in particular , the crucial inequality @xmath21 holds in a strong structure .",
    "this issue is dealt with in section 3 . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we discuss the preservation of the trend and the total variation respectively .",

    "in this paper we extended the lulu operators from sequences to real functions defined on a real interval using the lower and upper @xmath20-envelopes of functions .",
    "the obtained structure , although more general than the well known lulu structure of the discrete operators , retains some of its essential properties .    of significant importance is the link obtained between properties of functions and sequences that are samplings of these .",
    "particularly , we can easily observe that if a function @xmath34 has a good approximation @xmath350 that is @xmath20-monotone , then a sampling of @xmath350 at a uniform sampling interval of @xmath351 with @xmath352 then the sampling is @xmath353-monotone , and a discrete pulse transform will have no ( high)-resolution components less than @xmath353 .",
    "thus we may call @xmath350 a `` pulse limited '' function , in the same sense as a sequence is called `` band limited '' in the theory of wavelet analysis when there are no high frequencies present .",
    "since the total variation of a function is the supremum of the total variations of all its samplings , we can derive that the total variation of a sequence of samplings does not exceed that of the function .",
    "if the functions is @xmath20-monotone they are equal , provided the sampling interval @xmath351 is smaller than @xmath354 .",
    "this is important in image processing , where total variation is used as an appropriate norm @xcite .",
    "it may be illuminating to consider that the energy reaching the ear is appropriate as a natural norm , where the power spectrum yields important information for economical decomposition and storage of auditory signals .",
    "the eye does not even see with the total illumination as norm , but rather the measure of contrast .",
    "it is well known that we perceive an image in the same way under different illumination intensities .",
    "the total variation fits naturally as the sum of the absolute differences of intensity between neighbouring pixels .",
    "it turns out to be the natural norm in discrete pulse transforms , as they have a naturally associated `` parceval identity '' which can be considered analogous to the parceval identity in wavelet and fourier transforms , which is based on the energy distribution amongst resolution levels .",
    "we thus have a pulse spectrum associated with such a @xmath6-decomposition , which is useful for thresholding decisions for economical transportation and storage of the essentials of an image @xcite ."
