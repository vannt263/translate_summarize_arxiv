    "the launch of the wfc3/ir camera in 2009 signified a major milestone in our ability to observe galaxies within the cosmic reionization epoch at @xmath16 .",
    "thanks to its @xmath17 times higher efficiency for detecting galaxies in the near - infrared ( nir ) compared to previous cameras on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) we have pushed the observational frontier to within only @xmath18 myr from the big bang . in its first year of operation",
    "wfc3/ir resulted in the detection of @xmath19 new galaxies at @xmath20 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "three years of science operations of wfc3/ir and several deep extra - galactic surveys have now resulted in a large sample of more than 200 galaxies in the reionization epoch , primarily at @xmath21 and @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * )    from these samples it has become clear that the build - up of galaxies during the first gyr was a gradual process at @xmath22 .",
    "the end of reionization left no noticeable imprint on the galaxy population ( at least down to the current limits of @xmath23  corresponding to a star - formation rate of sfr@xmath24yr@xmath11 ) .",
    "the build - up of the uv luminosity function ( lf ) progresses smoothly across the @xmath25 reionization boundary , following a constant trend all the way from @xmath2 to @xmath26 .",
    "galaxies typically become brighter by @xmath27 per unit redshift accompanied by a proportional ( but somewhat larger ) increase in the average star - formation rate of galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the large samples of galaxies discovered at @xmath28 , the current observational frontier is at @xmath3 and at earlier times .",
    "this is a period when significant evolution of the galaxy uv lf is expected from models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observational evidence has been suggestive of a significant drop on the uv luminosity density ( ld ) at @xmath0 , but has not been conclusive @xcite . as a result , the extent to which the luminosity function and the star formation rate density are evolving at @xmath29 has been the subject of some debate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at these early epochs ,",
    "current galaxy samples are still very small as hst is approaching its limits .",
    "initially , only one @xmath30 galaxy candidate was identified ( udfj-39546284 ) , even in extremely deep wfc3/ir imaging of the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) as part of the hudf09 survey @xcite . when combined with all the existing data over the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) , this one source suggested that the galaxy population is changing quickly , building up very rapidly from @xmath4 to @xmath2 . in galaxies with sfr  @xmath31yr@xmath11 ( equivalent to @xmath23 mag ) , the inferred uv luminosity density ( ld ) was found to increase by more than an order of magnitude in only @xmath15 myr from @xmath4 to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is a factor @xmath32 times larger than what would have been expected from a simple extrapolation of the lower redshift trends of the uv lf evolution to @xmath4 .",
    "several datasets have allowed us to improve these first constraints . the multi - cycle treasury program clash ( pi : postman ) has provided four sources at @xmath33 @xcite . in particular , the detections of three @xmath3 galaxies around clash clusters by @xcite have provided a valuable estimate of the luminosity density in this key redshift range . estimating volume densities from highly - magnified sources found behind strong lensing clusters is challenging , involving systematic uncertainties due to the lensing model .",
    "@xcite used a novel technique of comparing the @xmath3 source counts to those at @xmath2 in the same clusters and obtained a good relative luminosity density estimate . since the @xmath34 density is well - established from the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this gave a more robust measure than trying to infer source densities directly using lensing models .",
    "interestingly , the three @xmath35 candidates from @xcite are completely consistent with the observed drop in the uv luminosity density and an accelerated evolution of the galaxy population that was previously seen at @xmath36 in the hudf and cdfs by @xcite .",
    "two other high redshift sources detected in the clash dataset ( one of which is in common with and proceeded the sample of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have added to the available constraints . @xcite and @xcite discovered two highly magnified @xmath30 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) galaxies in the analysis of the clash cluster data .",
    "the luminosity densities inferred from these galaxies are somewhat higher , but are very uncertain .",
    "the large errors on the luminosity density from these two detections encompass a wide range of possible trends from @xmath34 to earlier times .",
    "however , as we show later in this paper , taken together , the sources from the clash dataset along with the latest sources and constraints from the hudf / cdfs region , are consistent with our earlier estimates of substantial accelerated change in the luminosity density from @xmath4 to @xmath2 .",
    "additional progress in exploring the galaxy population at @xmath0 has been made through gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow observations .",
    "the current record holder of an independently confirmed redshift measurement was achieved at @xmath39 for grb090423 @xcite , and grb redshifts were photometrically measured out to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "these measurements can provide additional constraints on the total star - formation rate density in the very early universe , since grb rates are thought to be an unbiased tracer of the total star - formation rate density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the initial results are encouraging , it is clear that our understanding of the galaxy population at @xmath29 is still far from complete .",
    "given the very small number of sources in each study , it is perhaps not surprising that the uv luminosity density measurements at @xmath29 are currently all within @xmath41 of each other .",
    "a next step forward in exploring the @xmath33 universe can now be taken thanks to the 128 orbit hudf12 campaign ( pi : ellis , go12498 ) .",
    "while the critical @xmath42 observations to discover @xmath4 galaxies only reach deeper by @xmath430.2 mag compared to the previous hudf09 image , the hudf12 survey adds deep f140w ( @xmath44 ) imaging .",

    ", we adopt a lyman break galaxy selection to identify galaxies at @xmath78 .",
    "the major advantages of this approach over a photometric redshift selected sample as is used , e.g. , in @xcite are simplicity and robustness .",
    "the lyman break technique provides a straightforward and robust selection , which is easily reproducible by other teams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the simplicity of the lyman break color - color criteria also allows for a straightforward estimate of the selection volumes based on simulations .",
    "in contrast , the photometric redshift likelihood functions are heavily dependent on the assumed template set and even on the specific photometric redshift code that is used . additionally , the photometric redshift likelihood functions depend on largely unknown priors which are needed to account for the number density of intermediate redshift passive or dusty galaxies .",
    "a particular problem is that most high - redshift photometric analyses give equal weight to all templates at all redshift ( i.e.  they adopt a flat prior ) .",
    "this includes faint galaxies with extreme dust extinction at intermediate redshift or passive sources at @xmath79 , which are unlikely to be very abundant in reality .    a further uncertainty , in particular for high redshift sources , is how undetected fluxes are treated in the fitting process .",
    "this can have significant influence on the lower redshift likelihood estimates .",
    "given all these advantages , we will therefore select high - redshift galaxies using the lyman break technique and we will determine their photometric redshifts a posteriori using standard template fitting on this pre - selected sample of lbgs .",
    "the addition of deep f140w imaging data over the hudf gives us the ability to select new samples of @xmath3 galaxies over that field .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : filters ] , the absorption due to the inter - galactic neutral hydrogen shifts in between the @xmath58 and @xmath59 filters at @xmath33 . for a robust lyman break selection ,",
    "we thus combine the @xmath58 and @xmath59 filter fluxes in which galaxies start to disappear at @xmath3 .",
    "our adopted selection criteria are :    @xmath80    @xmath81 @xmath82    these criteria ( shown in figure [ fig : colsel ] ) are chosen to select sources at @xmath83 .",
    "we additionally use a @xmath84 criterion to cleanly distinguish our @xmath3 and @xmath4 samples ( see next section ) .",
    "we only include sources which are significantly detected in the @xmath42 and @xmath44 images with at least 3@xmath67 in each filter and with @xmath85 in at least one of the two . as a cross - check we selected sources based on an inverse - variance weighted combination of the @xmath59 , @xmath44 , and @xmath42 images at @xmath86 .",
    "both selections resulted in the same final sample of high - redshift sources , i.e. all selected candidates are @xmath87 detections .",
    "in addition to the color selections , we require sources to be undetected at shorter wavelengths .",
    "in particular , we use @xmath88 non - detection criteria in all optical bands individually .",
    "furthermore , we adopt an optical pseudo-@xmath75 constraint .",
    "this is defined as @xmath89 .",
    "the summation runs over all the optical filter bands @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath72 , and @xmath56 , and sgn is the sign function , i.e. @xmath90 if @xmath91 and @xmath92 if @xmath93 .",
    "this measure allows us to make full use of all information in the optical data .",
    "we only consider galaxies with @xmath94 .",
    "this cut reduces the contamination rate by a factor @xmath8 , while it only reduces the selection volume of real sources by 20% ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this is a powerful tool for providing source lists with low contamination rates ( see also section [ sec : scattersim ] ) .",

    "[ fig : sedfits ] , we additionally show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits and redshift likelihood functions for these sources . for comparison ,",

    "the vast majority of sources does show a prominent peak at @xmath95 together with a secondary , lower likelihood peak at @xmath48 .",
    "the best - fit photometric redshifts of these candidates range between @xmath96 , with the exception of one source ( xdfyj-39446317 ) , which has a zebra photometric redshift of only @xmath97 . however , using the eazy code and template set the best - fit redshift is found at @xmath98 .",
    "the photometric redshift likelihood function for this source is very wide using both codes .    from photometric scatter simulations ( see section [ sec : scattersim ] ) , we expect to find @xmath99 low redshift contaminants in our @xmath3 sample due to photometric uncertainties .",

    "following @xcite and @xcite , we select @xmath4 galaxies based on very red @xmath100 colors and we use spitzer / irac photometry to guard this selection against intermediate redshift extremely dusty and evolved galaxies in a second step .",
    "this selection process also used @xmath44 data when available ( i.e. over the hudf12/xdf field ) , and was used for all the datasets shown in figure [ fig : fields ] .",

    "as already pointed out in @xcite , galaxies with strong balmer breaks , or with high dust obscuration are a potential source of contamination for @xmath122 galaxy searches .",
    "in particular , in fields with limited depth in the wfc3/ir and optical data , such extremely red sources can remain undetected shortward of @xmath42 and can thus satisfy the hst selection criteria .",

    "they are all found at @xmath124 mag , which suggests that such red , lower redshift galaxies show a peaked lf . therefore , it is expected that they would be much less of a problem as contaminants in our fainter samples .    given this expectation , it is particularly interesting that we actually did not find the lower luminosity counterparts of such sources in any of the three deep fields , even though our irac data are sensitive enough thanks to the iudf program .",
    "although the survey volume of our deep data is limited , this further suggests that such red galaxies are indeed very rare at lower luminosities .",
    "it remains an open and interesting question as to the nature and redshift of these red @xmath124 mag galaxies ( the redshift is expected to be low , i.e. @xmath125 , but exactly over what redshift range they are seen is still quite uncertain ) .",
    "after excluding contamination from intermediate redshift , red galaxies , the next most important source of contamination is photometric scatter .",
    "photometric scatter can cause faint , low - redshift sources to have colors and magnitudes such that they would be selected in our sample .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of this effect with simulations using real galaxies based on our photometric catalogs .    in particular , we select all sources with @xmath42 magnitudes in the range 24 to 25 and we rescale their fluxes and apply the appropriate amount of photometric scatter as observed for real sources at fainter luminosities .",
    "we then apply our selection criteria to these simulated catalogs in order to estimate the contamination fraction .",
    "this is repeated 5000 times , which results in reliably measured contamination fractions .",

    "again this shows clearly the power of having deep shorter wavelength data , and the effectiveness with which data over a range of wavelengths can be used .    for the higher redshift samples , we estimate 0.2 and @xmath129 contaminants in the hudf12/xdf lbg selection at @xmath4 and @xmath38 , respectively , from analogous simulations .",
    "overall , our extensive simulations show that the contamination due to photometric scatter is thus expected to be @xmath130 for all these samples .    as an additional test of the contamination rate in our samples",
    ", we can use the best - fitting low - redshift seds for our @xmath3 candidates in order to estimate with what probability such types of galaxies would be selected as lbgs . in particular , we use the expected magnitudes of the @xmath48 sed fits shown in figure [ fig : sedfits ] , perturb these with the appropriate photometric scatter , and apply our @xmath3 lbg selection .",
    "we repeat this simulation 10@xmath131 times for each of our @xmath3 galaxy candidates , which allows us to estimate the probability for our @xmath3 sample to contain a certain number of contaminants .",
    "we find that at 65% confidence , our sample contains zero or one contaminant , while @xmath132 contaminants are found in 90% of the realizations .",
    "finally , the chance that the majority ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) of these @xmath3 candidates lie at @xmath48 is estimated to be @xmath134 .",
    "note that the average number of contaminants per realization is found to be 1.1 , i.e. , very similar to our previous estimate of 0.9 contaminants based on using the real , bright galaxy population .",
    "it should be noted that the sed - based test makes no assumptions about the relative abundance of faint , star - forming @xmath0 galaxies and the possible intermediate redshift passive sources at the same observed magnitude ( @xmath135 mag ab ) .",
    "both observationally and theoretically , the number density of low - mass , passive galaxies at @xmath136 is still very poorly understood , making it very difficult to gauge the contamination rates for our @xmath0 samples . in particular , these passive @xmath48 galaxies would need to have only @xmath137 @xmath10 and @xmath138 to @xmath139 mag .",
    "nevertheless , these tests show that while we can not completely exclude intermediate redshift contamination in our samples , the majority of our candidates are clearly expected to lie at @xmath0 . as we noted earlier , to account for this contamination",

    "galactic dwarf stars can be a significant concern for @xmath28 galaxy samples , due to strong absorption features in their atmospheres , which causes their intrinsic colors to overlap with the high - redshift galaxy selection criteria . however , this is not as much of a concern at @xmath122 .",

    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : colsel ] , where we plot the location of the stellar sequence including m , l , and t dwarfs .",
