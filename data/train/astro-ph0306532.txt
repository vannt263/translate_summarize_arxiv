    "bok globules are small , relatively isolated , simply - structured molecular clouds and therefore excellent objects to study the earliest processes of star formation , in particular the interplay between protostellar collapse , fragmentation , and magnetic fields .",
    "signs of star formation in many bok globules include bipolar molecular outflows ( e.g. , yun & clemens 1994a ) , infrared colors , and sub - millimeter properties that are consistent with class  0 protostars or embedded class  i sources ( yun & clemens  1994b , launhardt & henning  1997 ) .    to study one of the key parameters of the star formation process  namely the magnetic field ",

    ", magnetic field strengths and structures can be derived from the submillimeter polarization pattern ( e.g.  wolf et al .",

    "we observed the bok globules cb26 , cb54 , b335 , cb230 , and cb244 for which brief descriptions are given in the following : * cb26 * is a small , slightly cometary - shaped bok globule at @xmath2pc .",
    "the globule contains a nearly dispersed dense core and a young and large , perhaps early protoplanetary , disk ( launhardt & sargent 2001 ) . * cb54 * is a large bok globule associated with the molecular cloud bbw4 at @xmath3kpc ( brand & blitz 1993 ) and the reflection nebula lbn1042 .",
    "the globule contains a massive dense core of @xmath4m@xmath5 , which is associated with a bipolar molecular outflow ( launhardt & henning 1997 ; yun & clemens 1994a ) . at near - infrared wavelengths ,",
    "a small , deeply embedded young stellar cluster becomes visible .",
    "* b335 * is an isolated , nearly spherical bok globule at a distance of @xmath6250pc ( tomita et al .",
    "1979 , frerking et al .  1987 ) . the deeply embedded class  0 protostar drives a collimated bipolar outflow with a dynamical age of @xmath7yr ( e.g.  chandler et al",

    "* cb230 * is a small , bright - rimmed bok globule in a distance of 400@xmath8100pc associated with the cepheus flare molecular cloud complex .",
    "the globule contains a protostellar double core with 10  separation ( east - west ) .",
    "the western source with the more massive accretion disk and envelope drives a large - scale collimated molecular outflow of dynamical age @xmath9yr ( yun & clemens  1994a ) .",
    "the eastern source drives a weaker outflow that is probably not aligned with the large - scale outflow ( launhardt et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "* cb244 * is an isolated bok globule located at a distance of 180pc and probably associated with the lindblad ring ( kun  1998 ) .",
    "it contains two dense cores separated by @xmath690  .",
    "the more prominent south - eastern core is associated with a bipolar molecular outflow with a dynamical age of @xmath10yr ( yun & clemens 1994a ; launhardt et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the observations were performed at the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) between march 1 and 6 , 2000 and between september 10 and 14 , 2001 . the effective beam size ( hpbw ) is @xmath614.7  at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "polarimetry was conducted with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; holland et al .",
    "1999 ) and its polarimeter , scu - pol , using the 350 - 850@xmath0 m achromatic half - waveplate .",
    "flat - fielding , extinction correction , sky - noise and instrumental polarization removal have been performed with the data reduction package surf ( jenness & lightfoot  1998 ) .",
    "the polarization was computed using the polpack data reduction package ( berry & gledhill 1999 ) .",
    "we restrict the polarization analysis to the regions in which the total flux density per beam is above 5 times the rms in the maps ( measured outside the central sources ) .",
    "we do not use polarization vectors derived at positions where the scatter of the total flux density measurements between the jiggle cycles was larger than 20% of the average total flux density at that point and exclude polarization vectors with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the standard deviation of the polarization degree .",
    "the resulting polarization maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ of - cb26 ] and [ of - b335 ] .",
    "as found in previous polarization measurements towards other star - forming cores ( see , e.g. , matthews & wilson  2002 , houde et al .",
    "2002 , glenn et al .",
    "1999 ) , the degree of polarization decreases towards regions of increasing intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ scatt ] ) .",
    "possible explanations for this behavior are : ( a ) increased densities in the cores , which cause an increase of the collisional disalignment rate of the grains towards the centers of the cores , ( b ) insufficient resolution of the field structure associated with the core collapse , and ( c ) spherical grain growth in the denser regions which would result in unpolarized re - emission by the dust ( weintraub et al .",
    "because of the large density contrast between the unresolved central condensations and the envelopes , the increasingly poor grain alignment as density increases is expected to be the main effect .",
    "furthermore , the observations of b  335 and cb  230 not only show a decrease of the polarization degree , but also that the orientation of the polarization vectors does not change remarkably towards the dense cores .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that despite the decrease of the grain alignment rate , the magnetic field structure in the cores of these objects is not seriously disturbed , and thus still represents the primordial field . in the case of cb  244 and cb  54 on the other hand ,",
    "the orientation of the polarization vectors and therefore the structure of the magnetic field in the cores is irregular and we assume that it can no longer be accounted for being representative for the primordial field .",
    "polarized thermal emission by aligned non - spherical grains is the main source of polarized submillimeter radiation in bok globules ( e.g. , weintraub et al .",
    "2000 , greaves et al .",
    "irrespective of the alignment mechanism , charged rotating interstellar grains would have a substantial magnetic moment , leading to a rapid precession of the grain angular momentum around the magnetic field direction ( draine & weingartner 1997 ) .",
    "this implies a net alignment of the grains with the magnetic field .",
    "based on the work by chandrasekhar & fermi ( 1953 ) , the dispersion of polarization position angles is thought to be inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the magnetic field strength in units of g , @xmath15 is the gas density ( in units of g@xmath16 ) , @xmath17 the rms turbulence velocity ( in units of @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 the standard deviation to the mean orientation angle @xmath20 of the polarization vectors ( in units of radians ) .",
    "the resulting magnetic field strengths are in the range of @xmath21 g ( see tabl .",

    "( d ) rms turbulence velocity of a large sample of nearby star - forming bok globules derived from c@xmath22o ( j=2 - 1 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the comparison between the magnetic field structure and morphologic features of the globules , such as their elongation and outflow direction , reveals following correlations : first , the dense cores in b  335 and cb  230 are slightly elongated whereby the major axes are oriented almost perpendicular to the direction of the bipolar molecular outflows .",
    "second , in the class  0 source harbouring bok globules b  335 , cb  230 , and cb  244 , the outflows are oriented almost perpendicular to the mean direction of the magnetic field as seen in projection on the plane of the sky . in contrast , the directions of the magnetic field and ouflow are aligned more parallel in the massive globule core cb  54 and in cb  26 with an embedded more evolved class  i source .",
    "we want to remark that the statistical significance of the latter is low because of the large scattering of polarization directions measured in cb  54 and the small number of polarization vectors and low spatial resolution in the case of in cb  26 .",
    "we presented 850@xmath0 m polarimetric observations of dense envelopes around the very high - density protostellar condensations in five selected bok globules . in each object",
    "we found polarization degrees of several percent which decrease towards the cores of the globules .",
    "since the functional dependence of this behavior between the intensity and polarization is very similar for each globule , the optical properties of the grains do not seem to play a key role for the observed polarization decrease , but merely the coupling of the magnetic field to the grains .    using the formalism by chandrasekhar & fermi  ( 1953 )",
    "we derive an estimate of the mean magnetic field strengths in these globules on the order of several hundred @xmath0 g .",
    "these magnetic field strengths are well above those of the interstellar medium ( see , e.g. , myers et al .  1995 ) but comparable to typical magnetic field strengths found in molecular clouds , pre - protostellar cores , and other star - forming regions .",
    "we find the direction of the polarization vectors / magnetic field , the elongation of the bok globules , and the orientation of the outflows ( in the case of cb  26 : potential outflow direction along the lobes ) to be related to one another .",
    "in particular , we find the mean magnetic field direction of the bok globules with embedded class  0 sources ",
    "b  335 , cb  230 , and cb  244  to be oriented almost perpendicular to the outflow axis .",
    "in contrast to this , the magnetic field is nearly aligned with the potential outflow direction of cb  26 , harbouring a more evolved class  i source .",
    "our findings suggests that the mean magnetic field direction in a protostellar envelope changes from initially perpendicular to the outflow axis to a more moderate inclination at the end of the main accretion / ouflow phase .",
    "however , a larger sample of protostellar sources in different evolutionary stages has to be investigated to confirm this preliminary conclusion .",
