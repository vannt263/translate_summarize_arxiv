    "character of electronic states forming the magnetic moment leads to magnetic interaction anisotropies with respect to the crystallographic orientation of the vector connecting two mn moments.@xcite when spin - orbit coupling is taken into account,@xcite magnetic interactions also become anisotropic with respect to the relative orientation of the mn - mn connecting vector and the magnetic moment .",
    "some degree of non - collinearity is inevitable as a combined consequence of positional disorder and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "nevertheless a large suppression of the ferromagnetic moment is not expected theoretically@xcite in metallic ( ga , mn)as samples with mn concentrations above 1%",
    ". the minor role of non - collinearity is due largely to the long - range character of magnetic interactions , which tends to average out the frustrating effect of anisotropic coupling between randomly distributed mn impurities . in this paper",
    "we present detailed calculations of zero temperature magnetization in ( ga , mn)as ferromagnets and compare the results with superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) measurements in a series of samples with nominal mn doping ranging from @xmath12% to 8% .",
    "our calculations neglect effects that would lead to non - collinearity , appealing to expectations that these effects are small .",
    "our assumption is consistent with experimental observations of larger ferromagnetic moments in recently synthesized high - quality samples.@xcite the substantial magnetization suppression seen in many early ( ga , mn)as samples is attributed here primarily to the role played in those samples by interstitial mn atoms .",
    "the consistency of the theoretical and experimental data that we are able to achieve , allows us to rule out any marked magnetic frustrations in the ground state of high - quality ( ga , mn)as ferromagnets , and helps to clarify the character of magnetic interactions in this material .",
    "two distinct theoretical approaches are used in the paper to discuss magnetization in ( ga , mn)as semiconductors . in the more microscopic approach we account explicitly for the five @xmath2-orbital electrons on a substitutional mn@xmath3 impurity , and for the strong on - site coulomb correlations that suppress spin and charge fluctuations of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 state of the atomic mn @xmath2-shell .",

    "this approach will fail if the @xmath7 hybridization is too strong , but appears to be reliable for ( ga , mn)as .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ d5+hole ] we identify the key physical considerations related to ground - state magnetization of ( ga , mn)as ferromagnets by focusing first on a single mn(@xmath11+hole ) complex . we recall the connection between @xmath7 hybridization and the antiferromagnetic kinetic - exchange coupling , digress on the sign of the hole contribution to total moment per mn , and discuss the expected mean - field contribution to magnetization per mn from the mn local moment and from the antiferromagnetically coupled hole .",
    "we also explain that quantum fluctuations around the mean - field ground state are generically present because of antiferromagnetic character of the @xmath7 kinetic exchange interaction .",
    "magnetization calculations for the many - mn - impurity system are discussed in section  [ manymn ] .",
    "the relevant considerations here parallel those that apply for isolated mn(@xmath11+hole ) complexes , but differ in detail because of interactions between moments .",

    "are then used to evaluate contributions to the mean - field magnetization from hole kinetic and exchange energies and to confirm the expected weak role quantum fluctuations around the mean - field many - body ground state .",

    "partial concentrations of substitutional and interstitial mn impurities and the corresponding number of uncompensated local moments are derived from the nominal mn doping and from hall measurements of the hole density in as - grown and annealed samples.@xcite the collinearity of the ferromagnetic ground state in the ( ga , mn)as materials we study is tested by comparing experimental data with theoretical calculations .",

    "the sims measurements yield no information on the lattice site of the incorporated mn , and we expect that mn will be incorporated either on interstitial mn@xmath122 or on substitutional mn@xmath3 sites.@xcite post - growth annealing of the samples is performed in air at 190@xmath120c for 50 - 150 hours , which is an established procedure for removal of mn@xmath122 from the ( ga , mn)as layer . curie temperatures in the as - grown materials are within the range of 40 - 80  k and in the annealed samples between 40 and 150  k.@xcite      the magnetic moment of the samples is measured in a squid magnetometer , at 5k and under a 0.3 t external magnetic field .",
    "the external field is necessary to overcome in - plane anisotropy fields , so that the magnetization is aligned with the measurement axis of the squid .",
    "the diamagnetic contribution from the substrate is subtracted . measured magnetic moments normalized to the total mn concentration as obtained from sims calibration , @xmath123 , are shown in fig .  [ m - x ] .",

    "given these values , we assume@xcite that each mn@xmath122 present in the system is antiferromagnetically coupled to one mn@xmath3 and that both should be excluded from the active mn fraction for comparison between theory and experiment , _",

    "we rely on hall effect and magnetoresistance measurements at high magnetic field ( up to 16.5 t ) and low temperatures ( down to 0.3k ) , from which we evaluate the experimental hole density @xmath6 , after using a fitting procedure to separate normal and anomalous contributions to the hall resistance.@xcite we then assume that the single acceptors mn@xmath3 and double donors mn@xmath122 are the only impurities that contribute to @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath128 . from this expression and from the total mn concentration obtained by sims calibration ( @xmath129 ) we can estimate @xmath124 for both as - grown and annealed samples .",

    "xmcd measurements were performed using @xmath133% circular polarized x - rays from beamline id8 at the european synchrotron radiation facility .",
    "the samples are briefly etched in concentrated hcl prior to the measurements in order to remove mn oxide rich surface layers , which may obscure the signal from the ( ga , mn)as due to the relatively short probing depth of the measurement.@xcite after etching , total electron yield and fluorescent yield measurements are in quantitative agreement , indicating a uniform distribution of mn .",

    "a very large change in the absorption is observed on reversing the external field , with an asymmetry ( difference to sum ratio ) of up to 55% at the l@xmath137 peak .",
    "l@xmath134 absorption corresponds to transitions from the 2@xmath6 core states to the unfilled 3d states , so the mn l@xmath134 spectra gives direct information on the polarization of the mn 3@xmath2 band .",
    "applying the xmcd sum rules to the spectra allows quantitative and separate determination of the mn 3@xmath2 ground state orbital and spin magnetic moments.@xcite the moments are obtained on a per atom basis , without requiring separate measurement of the mn concentration , by normalizing to summed absorption signal .",
    "there are , however , inherent uncertainties in the application of the sum rules , in particular due to mixing of the 2@xmath138 and 2@xmath139 states which prevents the separate integration over each of the spin - orbit split core levels . comparison of calculated spectra with their corresponding ground state moments reveals that a correction factor of 1.47 is required for the spin moment to account for this mixing .",

    "we report on a combined theoretical and experimental analysis of the spontaneous magnetization in ( ga , mn)as diluted magnetic semiconductor ferromagnets . we find that the thermodynamic magnetization is dominated by a large local moment contribution of 5@xmath64 from nearly collinear substitutional mn atoms .",
    "evaluation of the smaller magnetization contribution from the valence band system that couples the local moments together involves a number of subtleties .",
    "in this paper we included hole - hole exchange interactions and we also accounted for spin - orbit coupling which means that no valence band orbital is completely spin - polarized and which substantially changes the overall electronic structure .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the band and local moment orientations also play a role because of the antiferromagnetic interaction between band and local moment spins .",
    "the end result of all these corrections is a magnetization per magnetically active mn ion that is suppressed from 5@xmath64 by @xmath140 .",
    "comparison with experimental data can be made reliably only after accounting for the formation of interstitial mn complexes during the mbe growth , and for their subsequent removal by post - growth annealing .",
