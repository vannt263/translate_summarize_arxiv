    "one of the most important problems in the classification of knots and links is the problem of detecting the minimal crossing number .",
    "one of the striking achievements in that direction is the celebrated kauffman - murasugi theorem @xcite , for further generalizations see @xcite establishing the minimality of reduced alternating diagrams for virtual links .",
    "this theorem ( conjectured by tait in late 19-th century ) was solved in late 1980-s by using a newborn polynomial : the kauffman bracket version @xcite of the jones polynomial @xcite .    in mid-90-s ,",
    "louis kauffman introduced @xcite a natural generalization of knots and links called virtual knot theory .",
    "this generalization can be treated both topologically ( as knots in thickened 2-surfaces up to homotopy and stabilization / destabilization ) and combinatorially ( via a generalization of planar diagrams with a new crossing type  called virtual  allowed ) . virtual knot theory",
    "played a crucial role in solving some problems about classical knots ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and for understanding of some notions in classical knot theory , and stating new ones ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most natural problems in virtual knot theory is to estimate classical and virtual crossing numbers . for estimating classical crossing number , a lot of results were obtained ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) by using some generalization of the kauffman - murasugi theorem etc .",
    "the problem this present paper is devoted to is to estimate from below the virtual crossing number : a partial case of this theorem detects non - classicality of a link ( in this direction we note the paper @xcite ) .",
    "note that this problem is closely connected to the problem of estimating minimal number of crossings for projecting a given singular link to a plane .",
    "we attack the virtual crossing number by using the @xmath1-polynomial introduced independently by several authors ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , for the proof of their coincidence , see @xcite , for detecting non - classicality see also @xcite ) , and we use the definition by the second named author of the present paper : this definition includes a `` counting variable '' for virtual crossings , and it is natural that the degrees of the polynomial invariant in this counting variable estimates the virtual crossing number from below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains all basic notions and the main theorem ( theorem 1 ) on virtual crossing estimates .    in section 3 , we prove some theorems delivering sufficient conditions for minimality and present several series of examples of minimal diagrams .",
    "we conclude our paper by section 4 with a list of unsolved problems .",
    "the authors are grateful to l.h.kauffman , a.t.fomenko and v.a.vassiliev for their attention to this work and fruitful consultations .",
    "virtual knot theory was invented by kauffman around 1996 , @xcite .",
    "a _ virtual diagram _ is a @xmath3-valent diagram in @xmath4 where each crossing is either endowed with a classical crossing structure ( with a choice for underpass and overpass specified ) or just said to be virtual and marked by a circle .",
    "a _ virtual link _ is an equivalence class of virtual link diagram modulo generalised reidemeister moves .",
    "the latter consist of usual reidemeister moves referring to classical crossings and the _ detour move _ that replaces one arc containing only virtual intersections and self - intersection by another arc of such sort in any other place of the plane , see fig .  [ detour ] .",
    "throughout the paper , we deal only with oriented links . by an",
    "_ arc _ of a planar diagram we mean a connected component of the set , obtained from the diagram by deleting all virtual crossings ( at classical crossing the undercrossing pair of edges of the diagram is thought to be disjoint as it is usually illustrated ) .",
    "we say that two arcs @xmath5 belong to the same _ long arc _ if there exists a sequence of arcs @xmath6 and virtual crossings @xmath7 such that for @xmath8 the arcs @xmath9 are incident to @xmath10 from opposite sides . a planar virtual diagram is said to be _ proper",
    "_ , if it has no cyclic long arcs .",
    "it is easy to show that equivalent proper diagrams can be transformed to each other by using generalized reidemeister moves in the class of proper diagrams .",
    "this can be done by adding / removing a curl ( by using the first classical reidemeister move ) when necessary . for each proper diagram ,",
    "the number of long arcs equals the number of classical crossings . in the sequel",
    ", we deal only with proper diagrams .",
    "now , let us construct the @xmath1-polynomial of virtual links ( and its unnormalized version called @xmath11 ) .",
    "let @xmath12 be a proper diagram of a virtual link @xmath12 with @xmath13 classical crossings .",
    "let us construct an @xmath14-matrix @xmath15 with elements from @xmath16 $ ] as follows .",
    "first , we enumerate all classical crossings of @xmath12 by integer numbers from @xmath17 to @xmath13 and associate with each crossing the ematnaing long arc .",
    "each long arc starts with a ( short ) arc .",
    "let us associate the label 1 with latter arc .",
    "all other arcs of the long arc will be marked by exponents @xmath18 , as follows .",
    "while passing through the virtual crossing , we multiply the label by @xmath19 if we pass from the left to the right or by @xmath20 otherwise .    since the diagram is proper , our labeling is well defined .",
    "consider a classical crossing @xmath21 with number @xmath22 .",
    "it is incident to some three arcs @xmath23 , belonging to long arcs with numbers @xmath24 , whence number @xmath25 belongs to the arc passing through @xmath21 .",
    "denote the power of @xmath19 of the label corresponding to @xmath26 by @xmath27 , and that of the label corresponding to @xmath28 by @xmath29 .",
    "let us define the @xmath22-th row of the matrix @xmath15 as the sum of the following three rows @xmath30 of length @xmath13 .",
    "each of these rows has only one nonzero element .",
    "the @xmath22-th element of the row @xmath31 equals 1 .",
    "if the crossing is positive , we set    @xmath32    otherwise we put    @xmath33    we set @xmath34 .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that if two virtual diagrams @xmath35 are equivalent then @xmath36 for some integer @xmath37 .",
    "denote by @xmath38 and @xmath39 the leading ( lowest ) degree of monomials @xmath40[s , s^{-1}]$ ] with respect to variable @xmath19 ; if @xmath41 , we set @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "here @xmath52 denotes number of virtual crossing that belong to @xmath51 , @xmath53 denote arcs on @xmath51 enumerated in their sequence on the long arc .",
    "now , using this notation , we can get another definition of alexander - like matrix @xmath54 .    the polynomial @xmath55\\in \\mathbb{z}[t , t^{-1}]$ ] , defined in following way , is called an _ incidence coefficient _ of classical crossing @xmath21 and arc @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath56 and @xmath21 are not incident , we set @xmath55= 0 $ ] .",
    "if they are incident , we have the following options : the arc ( 1 ) is emanating from the crossing , ( 2 ) or passing through it , ( 3 ) or coming into it , or simultaneosly realize some of conditions ( 1)-(3 ) ; accordingly , @xmath55 $ ] is defined as a sum of some of three polynomials :    \\(1 ) @xmath17 ;    \\(2 ) @xmath57 ;    \\(3 ) @xmath58 ;    where @xmath59 denotes a _ local writhe number _ of crossing @xmath21 ( recall that the _ local writhe number _ of a classical crossing is @xmath60 for @xmath61{skcrro.eps}}}$ ] and @xmath62 for @xmath61{skcrlo.eps}}}$ ] .",

    "if the other long arc goes from the left to the right , we call this arc _",

    "these two arcs may coincide if a long arc passes twice through a virtual crossing .",
