    "right : slight depression of @xmath1 due to the ionization of heavy elements.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the main sequence star hd 49933 , a solar - type star of spectral class f5 , has been observed since a few years ago .",
    "first from the ground , and then as a primary target of the corot mission @xcite .",
    "several authors obtained with different methods their fundamental parameters ( @xmath2 , \\text{log g}$ ] ) .",
    "these studies point to a metal poor star , slightly hotter than the sun .",
    "the acoustic oscillations exhibited by the star are thought to be driven stochastically by convective motions in the subsurface layers .",
    "however , the seismic analysis of this star was not straightforward .",
    "the chelle diagram @xcite has been widely used in asteroseismology by observers to organize and display the mode frequencies of solar like oscillations . the frequency ( @xmath3 ) is plotted versus the modulo of the large separation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this kind of representation originates a stack of frequencies aligned vertically by mode degree .",
    "consequently , irregularities are easily detectable and manifest themselves as a curvature of the vertical ridges of the chelle diagram , which in turn , are known to be related to surface effects and acoustic glitches . as an f - type star ,",
    "the star hd 49933 is an emblematic case of the `` f star problem '' , which consists in a difficulty in the identification of the modes due to their short lifetimes , and consequently , to their large line widths .",
    "this situation was observed for the first time , precisely , in this star .",
    "indeed , the mode line widths increase with increasing effective temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in some hot stars the mode line width become so large that makes it difficult to distinguish between the ridges @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the chelle diagram , thus originating two possible scenarios of mode identification .",
    "was the first who tried to resolve this ambiguity by fitting the power spectrum for both possible scenarios of identification .",
    "he then favored one of the scenarios , known in literature as scenario a. further studies followed without a definite and conclusive mode identification .",
    "however , with additional time of observation and improved methods , reverted to the initial mode identification .",
    "this second scenario of mode identification is known as scenario b. the work presented in this paper is based on the mode identification made by .",
    "+        in regards to magnetic activity , the corot target hd 49933 was the first star for which asteroseismology could claim the discovery of a magnetic cycle .",
    "@xcite were the first to observe variations with the activity in the p - mode frequencies and amplitudes of the star .",
    "these variations were confirmed recently by and present a pattern of anti - correlation between frequencies and amplitudes in the same way they are observed in the sun .",
    "they yield a magnetic cycle with a period of 120 days .",
    "the frequency shifts increase with increasing frequency and reach a maximum of @xmath7hz in the vicinity of @xmath8hz .",
    "this short magnetic cycle is confirmed by spectroscopy with a mount wilson s - index value of 0.3 @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the outer layers of solar - type stars are still far to be well described by theoretical models .",
    "this is because , in these layers , there are different and complex physical processes taking place in the same timescales .",
    "there are turbulent motions of the external convective zone and convective overshooting ; partial ionization regions of the most abundant chemical elements with the associated abrupt changes in the properties of stellar matter ; driving and damping of oscillation modes ; effects of non - adiabaticity ; differential rotation and magnetic fields generation through the dynamo mechanism .",
    "asteroseismology , as it is well known , is a powerful tool to infer the internal structure of stars using the information stored in the oscillation frequencies of the acoustic modes . yet , in the outer layers , the intricate web of physical processes mentioned above , will manifest itself in the frequencies of the p - modes .",
    "all current theoretical models fail in modeling the outer stellar layers .",
    "there is a systematic difference between the theoretical frequencies and the observational frequencies , even in the solar case .",
    "the most affected modes by the outer layers are the high frequency modes since the upper turning points of high frequency waves are located closer to the surface of the star",
    ". therefore , the systematic offset between theory and observation increases with increasing frequency .",
    "@xcite suggested a power law to correct this systematic difference .",
    "nevertheless , when studying specifically this external region of the star , the correction may blur or distort important information contained in this part of the spectrum .",
    "the phase shift experienced by the sound waves when they are reflected by the surface of the star , is a tracer that can be used to extract information about these more external layers .",
    "specifically , in this paper we use the derivative of the phase shift , the so - called seismic parameter @xmath9 , to extract information about the outer layers of the corot target hd 49933 .",
    "it is known that the oscillation pattern , i.e. , phase and amplitude , of the seismic signature @xmath9 , allows to characterize the partial ionization zones of the sun and solar - type stars @xcite . in the case of the sun it allowed the inference of the solar photospheric abundance of helium @xcite . by direct comparison of the theoretical and observational signatures of @xmath9 we aim to infer about the ionization processes taking place in the outer layers of hd 49933 .",
    "we computed four theoretical models , fully compatible to the other models of this star described in literature .",
    "our goal is to probe , from a seismological point of view , the outer layers of the star hd 49933 . in section [ sec:2 ] we describe and apply the seismic diagnostic @xmath9 to obtain a detailed characterization of the outer layers of the star .",

    ", we analyze the oscillatory component of the observed frequencies and relate it with a precise location in the convective zone of the star . finally , in section [ sec:5 ] we present some conclusions about the relationship between ionization processes in the outer layers of the star and oscillatory characteristics of the observed and theoretical seismic parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the complete fourth order set of differential equations describing the adiabatic stellar oscillations , can be reduced , in the cowling approximation , to a second order schrdinger type equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each stellar model the dependence of the outer phase shift on the frequency can be computed from the corresponding acoustic potential @xcite .    in the outer layers of a solar type star",
    "the sound speed is low .",
    "consequently , for low degree modes of oscillation , the vertical component of the wave vector is much greater than the horizontal .",
    "this means that the phase shift is a function of the frequency alone @xmath27 .",
    "the outer phase shift will carry all the uncertainties of these more superficial layers and also the features associated with non adiabatic processes taking place in these regions , and thus , it can be used as a seismic probe of the outermost layers of a solar type star .",

    "it allows to obtain information about the phase shift of the reflected sound waves from a model envelope and from a table of observational / theoretical frequencies .",
    "hence , we can explore the effect of the outer layers of the star on the oscillation spectrum .",
    "the star hd 49933 has been modelled a few times by different authors .",
    "we use the stellar evolution code cesam 2k to generate a grid of models with different values for the mass , metallicity and mixing length parameter .",

    "we compute @xmath9 according to @xmath41 the algorithm of the derivatives is based on central differences and the observational frequency table was taken from . to each model",
    "we have plotted the theoretical seismic parameter @xmath9 against the cyclic frequency @xmath3 and compare it with the observational parameter .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : 3 ] for @xmath6 modes over a range of frequencies from 1.2 mhz to 2.6 mhz in the case of observational frequencies , and from 0.78 mhz to 2.7 mhz in the case of theoretical frequencies .",
    "the use of the observational mode @xmath6 is justified by the following .",
    "first , the acoustic modes with degree @xmath6 are the modes with the best observational accuracy , i.e. , with smaller error bars .",
    "second , since we are using central differences to compute the numerical derivatives , @xmath6 modes are the modes which less suffer from boundary effects . besides",
    ", it is known that the success of any numerical differentiation is tightly connected with the structure of the data . in this work ,",
    "the minimal distance between frequencies is around @xmath42hz , whereas the accuracy of the data itself is @xmath43hz .",
    "then the errors associated with the derivatives can be considered acceptable .",
    "it is known that regarding the sun , the period of the sinusoidal component in @xmath9 is related to the location of the second ionization of helium whereas the amplitude of this sinusoid contains information about the helium abundance in the envelope @xcite .",
    "it is also clear from figure [ fig : 3 ] that the best agreement between theory and observations is achieved around the frequency of maximum power @xmath44 . in the high frequencies we have a severe disagreement between all theoretical models and observational @xmath45 .",
    "microscopic processes occurring in stellar interiors are closely related with macroscopic characteristics , some of which , we can observe and measure .",
    "thermodynamic properties of the stellar matter are thus crucial to explain and understand the macro / micro connections of the stellar structure .",
    "these thermodynamic properties depend on the degree of ionization of the stellar matter . with the increasing of the depth and consequently the increasing of temperature ( and density , and pressure ) , elements which are practically neutral at the surface , become progressively ionized .",
    "all chemical elements undergo processes of ionization from the surface to the interior of the star . depending on the atomic configuration of the element and on the thermodynamic properties of the star",
    ", different patterns of ionization profiles will emerge and reflect different internal structures . in figure",
    "[ fig : 4 ] we plot the degrees of ionization for light elements ( upper panel ) and heavy elements ( bottom panel ) against the acoustic depth @xmath0 .",
    "contrarily to light elements that are fully ionized well before the base of the convective zone , the ionization of heavy elements takes place through almost the whole star .      to understand the impact of the ionization processes in the outer layers of the star hd 49933 , specifically the ionization of heavy elements , we compute the distribution with the depth of an _ effective mean ionic charge_. we first define this charge as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the mean ionic charge of the element @xmath48 .",
    "then we take the gradient of this effective charge with respect to the acoustic depth to identify the regions with larger variations of mean ionic charge .",
    "figure [ fig : 5 ] shows the average ionic charges for each element as well as the effective mean ionic charge @xmath49 .",
    "also represented are the contributions of light elements ( hydrogen , helium ) and the contributions of heavy elements ( carbon , nitrogen , oxygen ) .",
    "figure [ fig : 5 ] also shows the distribution with the depth of the gradient of the mean charge .",
    "we can spot two distinct regions where there is a steep rise of the ionic charge , and consequently , a large variation of the gradient .",
    "these regions are indicated with vertical shaded bars in figure [ fig : 6 ] .",
    "the first region , closer to the surface , ( region 1 ) is clearly associated with the ionization of light elements , and depending on the model , stretches from @xmath50 s to @xmath51 s. the second of these regions ( region 2 ) we relate with the ionization of heavy elements .",
    "depending on the model this region ranges from an acoustic depth of @xmath52 s to @xmath53 s , between the region where light elements ionize and the base of the convective zone . comparing figures [ fig : 4 ] and [ fig :",
    "6 ] it is possible to notice that the abrupt variation of the gradient in region 2 corresponds in location to the ionization of the last electron of the l - shell .",
    "as it is well known , steep variations of the acoustic structure of a star can produce an oscillatory component in the eigenfrequencies of the star @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the acoustic depth of the steep variation region .",
    "@xmath57 is the radius of the star , @xmath58 the radial distance to the location of the steep variation region and @xmath19 represents the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "this oscillatory feature can be found not only directly in the eigenfrequencies but also in other observable seismic parameters .",
    "therefore , the oscillatory feature of the observational @xmath9 is intrinsically related to the location where the waves are scattered . to extract this information from the observable @xmath9 we perform as follows .",
    "first we do a linear polynomial fit to the observational @xmath9 , to account , roughly , for the contribution of the superadiabatic zone .",
    "then we subtract this contribution from the observational signature @xmath59 .",
    "finally , this difference is fitted to a sinusoid , using a least ",
    "squares procedure weighted by error bars values .",
    "figure [ fig : 7 ] shows the difference @xmath60 and the corresponding sinusoidal fit .",
    "the resulting value for the angular frequency is @xmath61 , meaning a cyclic frequency of @xmath62 .",
    "then , the period of the oscillation is @xmath63 , which results in an acoustic depth of @xmath64 s. this result shows that contrarily to what happens in the sun , the oscillatory feature in the observable @xmath9 is dominated by a scattering region located between the zone of the second ionization of helium and the base of the convective zone . taking into account the ionization profiles studied in section [ sec:3 ] , specifically the gradient of the total mean charge , we associate this oscillatory feature with the ionization of heavy elements : carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "this location is right between the zone of the second ionization of helium and the base of the convective zone , in the adiabatically stratified part of the convective zone .",
    "figures [ fig : 4 ] , [ fig : 5 ] and [ fig : 6 ] show that this is the region where heavy elements , namely cno , lose their last electrons of the l - shell . from the point of view of the equation of state ( eos ) , this is an interesting region in the star , because eos defines the first adiabatic exponent , and this in turn , defines the structure of the outer layers . the treatment and inclusion of processes for a multicomponent mixture of charges with all the complexities associated ( e.g. non ideal effects ) in the equation of state is not an easy task .",
    "we think that part of the mismatches we observe when comparing the theoretical and the observational seismic parameter @xmath9 ( figure [ fig : 3 ] ) could be due to a poor description of ionization in the equation of state .",
    "we have applied our analysis of the periodicities also to the theoretical @xmath9 for all the four models . with this intent",
    "we have considered a window of frequencies similar to the observational window and with the same number of points .",
    "for all the models the dominant period of the sinusoid is related with the zone of the second ionization of helium which is coherent from the perspective that the equation of state does not include an appropriate description of the ionization processes occurring in the outer layers of the star .",
    "the periodicity we observe in the observational @xmath9 and which we relate with the gradient of the effective charge @xmath65 is dominated by the ionization of heavy elements . moreover , using a different technique based on the second differences , detected an acoustic sharp feature on this star , located around 1370 s. they exclude the possibility of an artefact in the data but they do not attribute physical meaning to the feature .",
    "we think it is rather relevant that two distinct methods point to the same scattering location of acoustic modes in the outer layers of this star and we are suggesting in this paper a possible physical meaning to the origin of the unexpected oscillatory feature .",
    "@xcite also detected a region of rapid variation of the sound speed in the star @xmath66 centauri a , located 6% under the surface of the star in this deep part of the convection zone .",
    "a new generation of equations of state is being developed @xcite with the intent of providing an accurate description of the first adiabatic exponent in the convection zone .",
    "for the solar case , the results of a helioseismic inversion for the first adiabatic exponent looks promising .",
    "this work shows that the utilization of these equations of state to do the modeling of other stars with different chemical compositions and different internal structures , will surely improve our knowledge on stellar structure and evolution .     and",
    "the dotted gray line is a linear polynomial fit of the type @xmath67 @xmath68 to the observational parameter @xmath59 .",
    "dark red line shows the sinusoidal , least squares fit , to the difference @xmath60.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the outer layers of solar - type stars have a direct influence on the frequencies of the acoustic modes .",
    "acoustic glitches associated with partial ionization zones of light elements , particularly , the zone of the second ionization of helium have been detected for several solar - type stars from their oscillatory signatures in the frequencies @xcite .",
    "we used a seismic diagnostic , which acts as a proxy of the phase shift of the reflected sound waves , to explore the outer layers of the star hd 49933 .",
    "namely , all the region confined between the superadiabatic zone and the base of the convective zone .",
    "the method allowed to identify a seismologic relevant oscillatory signature in the frequencies , located between the zone of the second ionization of helium and the base of the convective zone , approximately 5% under the surface of the star . a detailed study of the ionization profiles of this star lead us to relate this signature with the ionization of heavy elements in the deep convection zone , more precisely , with the ionization of the last electron of the l - shell , in elements such as carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "further investigation is needed to clarify and understand the effects of ionization processes ( and all the complex physics associated ) in stellar structure and the subsequently effects in the oscillation spectrum . in hot solar - type stars , like",
    "the star hd 49933 , the pattern of partial ionization zones in the interior is expected to be different to that of a cool star like the sun .",
    "the absence of an explicit signature in the phase shift located in the cno region , for cool stars like the sun , should not be a surprise since this region is located deeper in these stars , overpassing the base of the convective zone .",
    "saha s ionization theory explains with success many features related with atmospheric and spectral characteristics of different stars .",
    "however , in the interior the situation seems to be different since the integration with the equation of state is not straightforward .",
    "if indeed , the oscillatory signature we detected in the seismic parameter @xmath9 is related to the ionization of heavy elements , it is clear that the current theoretical models underestimate the effects of partial ionization of heavy elements in the outer layers of solar - type stars .",
    "seismology may be starting to reveal that the current versions of the equation of state are not sufficient to describe the properties of the adiabatically stratified part of the convection zone in solar - type stars .",
    "finally and concerning the magnetic activity , it is known that hd 49933 is an active star and a fast rotator .",
    "it fits the relation between cycle and rotation periods proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first stellar cycle variations of the p - mode frequencies were detected precisely in this star by @xcite .",
    "the analysis of low - degree frequencies allowed @xcite to detect solar - cycle variations of the @xmath1 dip located at the region of the second ionization of helium .",
    "these variations seem to suggest that partial ionization processes in stellar interiors could have a tight relation with the magnetic activity of the stars .",
    "this plausible relation between ionization and magnetism is worth being studied in the future .",
