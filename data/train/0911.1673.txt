    "the problem of heat transport in chains of oscillators is one of the most relevant testing grounds to understand the behaviour of statistical systems steadily kept out of equilibrium . in the last decade ,",
    "numerical simulations and analytic arguments have contributed to clarify the behaviour of such systems in the thermodynamic limit ( see review papers @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , there is still a number of open questions such as the role of boundary conditions ( bc in the following ) and the convergence towards the stationary state . in spite of the continuous increase of computer performances , direct numerical simulations are still not so effective as to provide reliable data on sufficiently large systems . in this respect ,",
    "stochastic models like the one introduced in @xcite prove very helpful . in this paper",
    "we consider a version of such models already analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the model consists in a chain of @xmath1 coupled harmonic oscillators in interaction ( at the boundaries ) with two stochastic heat baths at different temperatures .",
    "in addition , the oscillators are subject to stochastic collisions that exchange the momenta of randomly chosen pairs of neighbouring oscillators , so that both energy and momentum are conserved . in a sense , collisions simulate the presence of nonlinear terms , as they contribute to ensuring ergodicity of an otherwise integrable model .",
    "in fact , it has been observed that this model closely reproduces the behaviour of standard nonlinear systems such as an fpu-@xmath2 chain , starting from an anomalous ( diverging ) heat conductivity @xcite . on the other hand , being the collision rule a perfectly linear process , the evolution equations for ensemble averages of the relevant observables can be written in an exact form and thereby solved numerically , without having to deal with the statistical fluctuations that affect finite samples . as a result , we have found that the invariant measure can be effectively approximated by the product of gaussian distributions aligned along the eigendirections of the covariance matrix @xcite",
    ". moreover , in @xcite , we investigated the continuum limit ( which corresponds to the large-@xmath1 limit ) of the covariance matrix , deriving suitable partial differential equations for the stationary state , in the case of fixed bc .",
    "as a result , we have obtained explicit formulae for the temperature profile and the energy current .",
    "remarkably , this is the first example of an analytic expression for the temperature profile in a system characterized by anomalous heat transport .    in @xcite",
    "we go beyond , by extending the continuum limit to include the time dependence of the covariance matrix .",
    "the reader is thus referred to @xcite for a more detailed introduction and the corresponding bibliography .",
    "the aim of this paper is to complement the analysis contained in @xcite with accurate numerical studies of finite samples with the goal of clarifying those issues that are too difficult to be worked out analytically .",
    "we start by numerically computing the stationary covariance for both free and fixed bc .",
    "this helps to shed some light on the nontrivial role played by bc , whenever heat transport exhibits an anomalous behaviour . in the presence of normal transport ,",
    "one expects that bc affect only a finite boundary layer so that , in the thermodynamic limit the leading term of the heat flux is independent of bc . on the other hand , it is known that in disordered chains of linear oscillators , the same system may even behave as a thermal superconductor or as an insulator , by simply switching from free to fixed bc @xcite . in generic nonlinear chains , numerical simulations",
    "suggest that the heat flux scales in the same way , independently of bc .",
    "however , the careful simulations performed in @xcite revealed that in the fpu-@xmath2 model , the ratio between the heat fluxes measured for free and fixed bc does not converge to 1 for @xmath3 .",
    "here we show that the same behaviour occurs in our stochastic model .",
    "actually the dependence on bc is even more subtle than one could have imagined : while in the case of fixed bc , the heat flux and the temperature profile are asymptotically independent of the coupling strength with the thermal baths , the same is not true for free bc .",
    "a second objective of this paper is the analysis of the convergence towards the steady state .",
    "this question , which has been hardly discussed in the literature , can be straightforwardly addressed for our model , as it amounts to computing the eigenvalues of the evolution operator for the covariances .",
    "moreover , we also compare the convergence of the average heat flux for different system sizes to show how careful direct simulations must be , if they have to be trusted .",
    "we find that finite  size effects associated with the relaxation rates of slow , i.e. long - wavelength , modes significantly modify the asymptotic scaling of the relaxation process . in practice , we find numerical evidence that the theoretical hydrodynamic scaling holds only over a finite range of time scales , although its duration diverges with @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : cov ] , we briefly recall the definition of the covariance matrix , and the coupled equations governing its evolution towards the stationary value",
    ". some properties of the steady state are discussed in section [ sec : stat ] .",
    "the problem of the approach to the steady state is addressed in section [ sec : relax ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we summarize our main results .",
    "in this section , we introduce the minimal notations and definitions needed to follow the main discussion presented in the following sections . the reader interested in a more detailed presentation",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath1 unit - mass particles interacting via nearest - neighbour harmonic coupling of frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the equations of motion are given by    [ eq : eqs - motion ] & q_n & = & p_n + & p_n & = & ^2 ( _ n , nq_n+1 - 2q_n + _",
    "n,1q_n-1 ) + _ n,1(^+ - q_1 ) + _ n , n(^- -q_n )  ,    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the momentum and displacement from equilibrium position of the @xmath7-th particle , @xmath8 is the kronecker delta and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are independent wiener processes with zero mean and variance @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath13 is the coupling constant . in the following free and fixed boundary conditions will be considered . these can be expressed in terms of the position variable @xmath14 as : @xmath15 , @xmath16 for _ free _ bc and @xmath17 for _ fixed _ bc .",
    "we consider the covariance matrix written as @xmath18 where the matrices @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , of respective dimension @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the average over phase space probability distribution function @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the particle relative displacements .",
    "the variables @xmath29 are the convenient choice to deal with : one the one hand , absolute positions are not well defined for free bc and on the other hand , the potential energy is expressed in terms of relative differences .",
    "the only subtlety is that the domain of definition of @xmath30 differs from that of @xmath31 .",
    "thereby , the bulk of the system is defined as @xmath32\\}$ ] and @xmath33\\}$ ] .",
    "the evolution equations for @xmath34 in the bulk are    [ eq : cdot ] & _ i , j &  =  & _ j , i-_j , i-1+_i , j-_i , j-1  , + & _ i , j &  =  & _ i , j-_i-1,j+ ^2(_i , j+1-_i , j)+ ( _ i , j+1+_i , j-1 - 2_i , j )  , + & _ i , j &  =  & ^2(_j+1,i-_j , i+ _ i+1,j-_i , j ) + _ i , j  .",
    "these equations follow from the deterministic equations of motion plus the contribution of the stochastic noise ( @xmath35 denotes the collision rate ) , that is described by the collision matrix @xmath36 , @xmath37 on the boundaries , several changes appear in the velocity fields .",
    "the interested reader can find a full description in section 2.2 of @xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to show the contribution arising from the coupling with the heat bath , namely @xmath38",
    "in this section we investigate some properties of the nonequilibrium steady state , for both fixed and free bc .",
    "the stationary state is obtained by considering the time - independent solution of equations .",
    "it can be efficiently determined by exploiting the sparsity of the corresponding linear problem , as well as the symmetries of the unknowns ( this approach has been followed in @xcite for fixed bc ) .",
    "alternatively , one can just let evolve equations starting from any meaningful initial conditions , as the dynamics will necessarily converge towards the only stable stationary state ( here we have adopted this latter approach also because we wish to study the convergence  see in the following ) .",
    "all numerical results presented in this paper have been obtained for @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "this is by no means a limitation , as all these parameters can be easily scaled out due to the linear structure of the model .",
    "accordingly , they will not be mentioned again , unless specifically needed for a comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "the first observable we have looked at is the energy flux at position @xmath42 which , in terms of the matrices @xmath21 , @xmath20 is written as @xcite @xmath43 we have adopted the convention that a positive flux corresponds to a propagation towards increasing values of the spatial index @xmath42 .",
    "the first term stems from the deterministic forces and provides for the leading ( anomalous ) contribution , while the second one accounts for energy exchanges due to collisions of nearby particles . in the stationary state ,",
    "@xmath44 is independent of @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath45 .    in figure [ fig1 ] we show @xmath46 as a function of the inverse of the system size @xmath1 .",
    "the results refer to free bc ( as we do not have analytic estimates to compare with ) , @xmath47 and different values of the collision rate @xmath35 ( see the various symbols as described in the figure caption ) . in all cases there",
    "is a convincing evidence that @xmath48 , similar to what predicted analytically in @xcite for the case of fixed bc . as a consequence , the effective conductivity",
    ", @xmath49 diverges as @xmath0 .",
    "however , from figure [ fig1 ] it is also evident the presence of sub - leading singular corrections which hinder the extrapolation of the asymptotic value .",
    "in analogy to @xcite , we introduce the ansatz , @xmath50 by using this formula to fit the data , we obtain the curves reported in figure [ fig1 ] which reproduce quite well the raw data .",
    "notice that the convergence is from below for smaller @xmath35 values , while from above for larger collision rates .",

    "the lines are obtained by fitting the data with equation  . ]",
    "the extrapolated @xmath53 values are plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] , where we can see that @xmath54 , as found for fixed bc @xcite .",
    "for @xmath55 , the extrapolated value of @xmath53 suffers a substantial uncertainty due to large finite - size corrections ( that become even more sizeable for yet larger @xmath35 values ) .     as a function of the collision rate @xmath35 for free bc and the same parameter values as in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "data are plotted in log - log scales .",
    "the error bar for @xmath55 has been estimated from a rough comparison among different extrapolation schemes .",
    "the dashed line is a power law fit of the first four data : its slope is -0.51 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the analytic solution for fixed bc ( equation ( 20 ) of @xcite ) . ]",
    "so far , we have not found any relevant difference between fixed and free bc .",
    "the heat flux scales in the same way in both cases and exhibits the same dependence on the collision rate .",
    "if the effect of the bc were restricted to a layer of finite width around the boundary , in the thermodynamic limit , the thermal resistance of a given chain would be independent of the type of thermal contact .",
    "in other words , we should expect @xmath53 to be independent of the bc .",
    "however , this is not the case , as it can be inferred from figure  [ fig2 ] , where we have also plotted the analytic curve for the fixed bc case ( equation ( 20 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "for free bc , the heat flux is approximately twice as that obtained for fixed bc .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same effect was found in the simulations of fpu-@xmath2 chains @xcite , although with a slightly different value of the ratio ( around 1.7 in that case ) .",
    "since the flux is constant along the chain , this means that even deeply in the bulk , the system perceives the effect of the boundaries .",
    "in particular , from the knowledge of the local temperature profile and from the heat flux , one can in principle infer the type of bc .",
    "these results suggest that this is another way anomalous conduction manifests itself .",
    "the whole scenario is even more subtle than suggested by figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "in fact , for free bc , the leading term of the heat flux depends not only on @xmath35 but also on the coupling strength @xmath13 with the heat bath , while this is not so for fixed bc .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ figrat ] , where we plot the ratio @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the heat flux in a chain of length @xmath1 and for a given value of @xmath13 .",
    "it is not surprising to see that the coupling with the heat baths modifies the flux in chains of finite length .",
    "however , we see that for fixed bc , the effect of the coupling vanishes as @xmath58 converges to 1 ( see the lower curve in figure  [ figrat ] ) . on the contrary , for free bc ,",
    "@xmath58 remains significantly different from 1 .",
    "this suggests that fixed bc may lead to a kind of universal behaviour , namely the heat flux and also the temperature profile are independent of the details of the coupling with the heat baths .",
    "this is not the case for free bc",
    ". it would be interesting to check whether the same holds true in generic nonlinear chains .    ) , for free ( diamonds ) and fixed ( circles ) bc as a function of @xmath59 , and for @xmath60 .",
    "the error on @xmath58 for free bc and @xmath61 is due to a not yet relaxed dynamics . ]",
    "another observable of interest is the temperature profile @xmath62 . in figure [ profili ]",
    "we show the temperature profile for free bc and three different sizes , as a function of the `` normalized '' position along the chain @xmath63 , that varies in the interval @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the data collapse is coherent with the scaling assumed in the continuum approach @xcite .",
    "the shape of the profile is qualitatively similar to that obtained for fixed bc but , although here there are no ( square - root ) singularities at the boundaries of the chain ( see equation ( 19 ) and ( 79 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the profile itself depends on both @xmath35 and @xmath13 .",
    "evidence of such a dependence can be appreciated in the the inset of figure [ profili ] , where the difference @xmath65 between the profiles corresponding to @xmath47 and @xmath66 is plotted in for three different system sizes .",
    "in fact , we see that @xmath65 does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit",
    ". moreover , the regions around the boundaries are affected by strong finite - size effects .",
    "in fact , one expects that @xmath67 , as the temperature necessarily converges , as @xmath68 , to that of the attached heat bath .     for @xmath60 and @xmath47 and free bc , for @xmath1 = @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "the potential energy profile @xmath19 closely reproduces the kinetic energy profile ( see also @xcite ) . in order to appreciate its contribution ,",
    "it is necessary to look at higher - order corrections .",
    "this can be done by introducing @xmath86 which measures the mismatch between kinetic and potential energy .",
    "figure [ covfx]b shows that along the diagonal ( see the lower set of curves ) , @xmath82 scales as @xmath52 everywhere except perhaps at the boundaries . from a physical point of view , this implies that everywhere in the bulk , the system is locally at equilibrium ( with @xmath52 finite - size deviations from the virial equality ) .",
    "the wild behaviour observed near the boundaries suggests the existence of nontrivial boundary layers .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in the next subsection .",
    "analogously to @xmath21 , @xmath82 exhibits a `` discontinuity '' when moving away from the diagonal . indeed , in the upper set of curves of figure",
    "[ covfx]b we show that @xmath87 is of order @xmath88 .",

    "the deviations from a perfectly flat shape reveal again the presence of nontrivial boundary layers . along the diagonal",
    "the antisymmetric component @xmath84 is zero by construction , while along the first subdiagonal , @xmath84 scales as @xmath52 ( see figure [ covfx]d ) .    in figure [ covfx2 ]",

    "we have found that @xmath84 and the derivative of @xmath83 along @xmath94 are both discontinuous across the diagonal , in agreement with the theoretical analysis in @xcite .",
    "all the results are independent of @xmath13 except for the variable @xmath82 which , for @xmath96 , is constant away from the diagonal and of order @xmath52 .",
    "we would like to remark that this anomaly does not affect the theoretical analysis carried in @xcite and @xcite , as ( for fixed bc ) @xmath82 does not contribute to the leading behaviour of the temperature profile and of the heat flux .",
    "the very good overlap among the curves obtained for different system sizes confirms the scaling behaviour of the off - diagonal already seen in figure [ covfx ] .",
    "most important , the observed scaling corroborates the validity of the _ ansatz _ used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "summarizing , for fixed bc and far from the boundary we find that :    * along the diagonal , @xmath82 is @xmath97 . off - diagonal , @xmath82 is @xmath98 for @xmath90 and @xmath97 otherwise .",

    "we now turn our attention to the free bc . as it can be seen in figure [ covfr ] , the correlators scale with @xmath1 in the same manner , irrespectively of the boundary conditions .",
    "we only notice the following qualitative differences : first , with free bc , the convergence at the boundaries is more effective than for fixed bc ( compare figure [ covfx]b with figure [ covfr]c ) .",
    "second , as a function of @xmath94 , some additional oscillations of @xmath20 can be seen only for fixed bc ( figure [ covfx]c and figure [ covfr]b ) .",

    "this is also not surprising as @xmath35 quantifies the strength of the internal stochastic process and thereby of the corresponding relaxation processes .",

    "unfortunately , we have not found a way to establish a direct connection between slow modes ( those characterized by a small @xmath138 ) and hydrodynamic modes , as this would require determining not only the eigenvalues , but also the eigenvectors .",
    "this task is numerically unfeasible , as the dimension of the space increases quadratically with @xmath1 , and it is not even easy to determine the spectrum , let alone the eigenvectors . in practice , we have been able to determine the entire spectrum only up to @xmath139 .",
    "as far as we are concerned with the slowest relaxation processes , we can employ an alternative method akin to that used for the computation of the maximum lyapunov exponent of a dynamical system .",
    "indeed , for asymptotically long times @xmath140 in order to estimate @xmath141 , we integrated numerically the differential equations ( [ eqx ] ) ( actually it suffices to consider the homogeneous system @xmath142 since @xmath129 is irrelevant ) starting from random initial conditions with unit euclidean norm , @xmath143 .",
    "for the sake of accuracy , we divided the time @xmath144 of the whole run into @xmath7 consecutive time intervals , each of length @xmath145 , so that @xmath146 . at the end of each time interval",
    ", we store the corresponding growth rate and renormalize the vector @xmath124 to a unit norm .",
    "finally , we determine @xmath141 as the average @xmath147 as a result , we have been able to investigate systems of size up to @xmath74 .    , for @xmath35=1 and fixed bc .",
    "data is plotted in log - log scales . in panel ( a ) , the maximum ( real ) exponent @xmath141 ( circles ) is plotted together with a power - law best fit @xmath148 ( dashed line ) . in panel",
    "( b ) , the real ( circles ) and imaginary ( square ) parts of the second eigenvalue @xmath149 are plotted .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the power - law fits @xmath148 and @xmath150 respectively . ]",
    "the numerical results plotted in figure [ fig4]a show that for the considered parameter values , @xmath141 is real and goes to zero with some power of @xmath1 .",
    "a best fit suggests that @xmath151 .",
    "the same approach allows determining the corresponding ( slowest ) `` mode '' of the linear operator @xmath127 . in figure [ evector ]",
    "we plot the result obtained for @xmath74 .",
    "it looks very similar to the fourier modes that we expect on the basis of the theoretical analysis carried out in @xcite and the order of magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalue is in agreement with that analysis .",
    "corresponding to @xmath141 , for @xmath74 and @xmath60 .",
    "starting from the highest panel on the left and going in clockwise sense , we plot the matrices @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively . ]    for @xmath156 we have been able to determine the entire spectrum .",
    "it turns out that the second and third eigenvalues are complex conjugate . in figure",
    "[ fig4]b we plot their real and imaginary parts .",
    "the real part scales as @xmath157 , a value that , despite the limited amount of data , suggests again an asymptotic @xmath158 behaviour .",
    "instead , the imaginary part scales nearly as @xmath52 . since this model",
    "is characterized by the presence of sound waves , we expect the imaginary part of @xmath149 to be connected to the periodicity due to the propagation of such waves .",
    "the period @xmath159 of the oscillations can be written as @xmath160 where @xmath136 is the sound velocity ( equal to @xmath4 in our arbitrary units ) , so that @xmath161 if we substitute for @xmath162 the value found numerically , we obtain @xmath163 , thus confirming our expectations . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath158 dependence of the real parts poses problems of consistency with the presence of an anomalous heat transport , as the @xmath158 dependence is expected to hold for normal heat conduction . in order",
    "get a better understanding of this , we have investigated the convergence of a specific observable , namely the flux @xmath164 .",
    "more precisely , we have studied the relative deviation of the flux at time @xmath165 from its asymptotic value ( see equation ( 20 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "this is shown in figure [ figf ] where , starting from an equilibrium state at temperature @xmath166 ( so that @xmath167 ) , @xmath168 is plotted as a function of time .",
    "we have considered two different definitions of instantaneous flux : @xmath42 ) the energy flux along the first bond ( i.e. directly in contact with the heat bath ) , which corresponds to the dashed curves in figure  [ figf ] ; @xmath169 ) the average flux ( along the whole chain ) , which corresponds to the solid curves .",
    "altogether , @xmath170 is a measure of the deviation from the stationary state at time @xmath165 . in order to compare the curves corresponding to three different sizes ( @xmath85 , 400 , and @xmath72 ) ,",
    "the time variable has been suitably scaled ( by a factor 8.95 for @xmath85 and 2.97 for @xmath74 ) .",
    "the first part of the curves nicely overlap along a straight line , which signals an exponential convergence with a rate @xmath171 which , taking into account the temporal rescaling factors , is well reproduced by the law @xmath172 a best fit of the numerical results yields @xmath173 in good agreement with the second eigenvalue of the operator theoretically derived in @xcite , that is equal to @xmath174 ( see the spectrum plotted in figure 1 in @xcite , which has been obtained by setting all parameters equal to 1 ) .",
    "the reason why the first eigenvalue does not play any role in our numerical study is that the corresponding eigenmode is not excited for our choice of the initial condition that is characterized by exactly the same average temperature as that of the asymptotic stationary state .",
    "the curves reported in figure [ figf ] show that for any finite @xmath1 there exists a crossover time beyond which a yet slower convergence sets in . by fitting the final slope",
    ", one can verify that the time scale of this last part of the convergence process is on the order of @xmath175 , in agreement with the previous spectral analysis .",
    "however , it is important to notice that this time increases with @xmath1 and thereby corresponds to increasingly small scales ( look at the vertical axis in figure [ figf ] ) .",
    "altogether , this means that the components of the initial state that lie along the slowest components become increasingly small upon increasing the system size @xmath1 , until they vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one way to understand the unphysical character of these `` super slow '' modes is as follows .",
    "any meaningful invariant measure is characterized by a set of correlators , but the converse is not true . only the covariance matrices @xmath176 that are positive semi - definite can correspond to physically meaningful state .",
    "for instance , we have verified that a sufficiently large perturbation along the eigenmode depicted in figure [ evector ] leads to unphysical matrices .     and @xmath47 .",
    "the relative amplitude of the heat flux ( see the text for its definition ) is plotted versus time for three different sizes ( @xmath85 , 400 , 800 ) and for two definitions of the flux .",
    "the dashed curves refer to the flux along the first bond of the chain ; the solid curves refer to the spatially averaged flux .",
    "the time axis has been suitably rescaled to emphasize the scaling behaviour of the initial exponential regime . ]",
    "the study of heat transport in a chain of @xmath1 particles with nearest - neighbour coupling and conservative noise allows one to investigate both analytically @xcite and numerically many subtle aspects of anomalous transport in one - dimensional systems . since an analytical solution is available only for fixed bc , the free bc case can be investigated only by means of numerical methods .",
    "the comparison between the two cases shows that the physics of heat transport strongly depends on the choice of bc .",
    "for instance , as already observed in the fpu-@xmath2 model @xcite , the ratio between the heat fluxes measured with free and fixed bc does not converge to 1 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "moreover , we find that for fixed bc the heat flux and the temperature profile are independent of the coupling strength with the thermal bath , while this does not hold for free bc . nonetheless , the anomalous scaling of heat conductivity with the system size ( @xmath178 ) is found to be independent of the choice of bc .",
    "we have also investigated the convergence to the stationary state , both by determining the eigenvalues of the evolution operator of the covariance matrix , and by following the evolution of the average heat flux when starting away from the stationary state .",
    "the analysis reveals that over long time scales , the convergence is controlled by a rate @xmath171 which scales as @xmath179 .",
    "this means that if one wishes to extract reliable numerical data by performing direct numerical simulations , e.g. , in a lattice of size @xmath180 , it is necessary to evolve the system well above @xmath181 time units .",
    "it should be kept in mind that similar limitations hold for deterministic nonlinear systems , even though they are , in general , characterized by slightly different exponents @xcite .",
    "finally , our analysis of the time - dependent solution has revealed a crossover from a typical fractional diffusion regime to a superslow relaxation .",
    "the crossover time is found to increase with the system size , suggesting that the latter regime becomes irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
