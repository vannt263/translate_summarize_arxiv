    "surprising discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 at almost 40 k @xcite has re - attracted attention to the superconductors with an electron - phonon interaction mechanism . due to their eight phonon branches and a high density of scatterers in the form of boron atoms",
    "the metallic and non - magnetic hexaborides were regarded once as possible candidates for high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "these expectations have not been met when yb@xmath0 has the highest transition temperature _ _ t__@xmath3 8.4 k among them @xcite and isostructural lab@xmath0 with a very similar electronic structure is not superconducting at all @xcite .",
    "it was believed for a long time that a dominant contribution to the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) in hexaborides leading eventually to superconductivity came from the boron sublattice with a lot of phonon branches stretched up to 160 mev @xcite .",
    "but later , mandrus _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite noticed that due to a large space of metal atom among the boron octahedral cages the metal atoms can develop large unharmonic vibrational amplitudes with strong epi .",
    "then , lab@xmath0 or yb@xmath0 can be modeled as a debye solid of the rigid boron framework and metals ions can be treated as independent harmonic oscillators ( einstein oscillators ) .",
    "the local vibrational modes of the la ions are the most important for explanation of the low temperature resisitivity and heat capacity in lab@xmath0 as was also suggested by the neutron experiments of smith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showing rather rapid flattening of the acoustic modes near 13 mev due to non - interacting vibrations of la ions .",
    "some of us @xcite have measured the epi function of lab@xmath0 directly by the point - contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) detecting the whole set of 8 modes starting from the prominent peak at 13 - 15 mev up to 160 mev with the resulting electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath4 showing very weak electron - phonon coupling in the system . in case of yb@xmath0 the rattling motion of y ion",
    "is now supposed to be dominant in the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "based on this assumption lortz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have exploited the specific heat and resistivity measurements as `` thermal spectroscopies '' to deconvolve the phonon density of states and the spectrum of the electron - phonon interaction in yb@xmath0 .",
    "their results suggest that the superconductivity is mainly driven by a low lying phonon mode ( at @xmath5 mev ) which is associated with the yttrium ions in oversized boron cages .",
    "lower vibration frequency of lighter y in yb@xmath0 than frequency of la vibrations in lab@xmath0 has been attributed to the weaker bond of y due to smaller radius in the same boron cage .",
    "the electronic specific heat revealed that yb@xmath0 is a strong coupling superconductor with the reduced energy gap @xmath6 and the coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "three spectroscopy experiments performed on yb@xmath0 have been published to our knowledge so far .",
    "@xcite determined from gaas point contacts on yb@xmath0 the superconducting gap @xmath8 mev which with the bulk @xmath9 k ( local @xmath10 was not measured ) yields @xmath11 .",
    "also an epi peak at 11 mev was observed with the gap energy subtracted .",
    "the photo - emission spectroscopy results of souma et al .",
    "@xcite indicate similar conclusions .",
    "_ @xcite prepared the tunneling sandwich on yb@xmath0 film naturally oxidized with in top electrode and obtained @xmath12 , the intense epi peak at 8 mev in discrepancy with kunii and @xmath13 .",
    "no significant contribution to epi was detected above 16 mev .",
    "we present a detailed experimental study on yb@xmath0 single crystal with @xmath10 of 7.5 k via point - contact ( pc ) spectroscopy .",
    "single @xmath14-wave superconducting energy gap with a reduced value of @xmath15 close to 4 together with its classical temperature and magnetic - field dependence have been found .",
    "moreover , an electron - phonon - interaction peak has been directly observed in the second derivative of the current - voltage characteristics in the superconducting state . upon application of magnetic field the energy position of this peak shifts to lower energies . from data",
    "analysis the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting energy gap has been inferred .",
    "importantly , the energy position of the epi feature shifts in increasing magnetic field to lower energy exactly likewise the superconducting gap is closing .",
    "this has been a direct proof that the low energy phonon mode near 7.6 mev is mediating superconducting pairing , in agreement with the conclusions of lortz _ et al . _",
    "a micro - constriction between two metals with the contact diameter @xmath16 much smaller than the mean free path of electrons @xmath17 can serve as a device for quaisparticles spectroscopy since applied voltage @xmath18 is directly related to the quasiparticle energy excess @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electron s charge .    in case of two normal metals forming the junction the pc current @xmath21 comprises beside the major term @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the pc resistance also a small negative inelastic contribution @xmath24 on the order of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the electronic inelastic mean free path , yielding nonlinearities in @xmath27 curve at characteristic epi energies / voltages .",
    "small nonlinearities are better pronounced as peaks in the second derivative @xmath28 which is directly related to the point - contact form of the electron - phonon interaction function @xmath29 @xcite . here",
    ", the matrix element @xmath30 describes the strength of electron - phonon interaction in the pc geometry and @xmath31 is the phonon density of states .",
    "when one of the pc - forming electrode is a superconductor , below @xmath10 a phase coherent state of cooper pairs is formed in it . for a bias energy @xmath32 ,",
    "a direct transfer of the quasi - particles is not possible due to existence of the energy gap @xmath33 in the spectrum of the superconductor .",
    "the transport of the charge carriers is realized through andreev reflection with an excess current @xmath34 which makes the pc current inside the gap voltage twice bigger than in the normal state . for biases larger than the gap voltage",
    "the excess current becomes constant and equals to @xmath35 .",
    "the pc conductance @xmath36 shows a double increase below the gap voltage @xmath37 compared to the normal state or to what is observed at very large bias where the coupling via the gap is inefficient . if a barrier is formed at the point - contact junction a giaever - like tunneling component contributes to the charge transfer as well .",
    "evolution of the @xmath38 vs. @xmath18 curves for different interfaces characterized by arbitrary transmission probability @xmath39 has been modeled by blonder , klapwijk and tinkham ( btk ) theory @xcite . in case of a pc interface with an intermediate transmission probability",
    "@xmath40 a minimum appears at zero bias @xmath41 = 0 , but also two peaks are visible at @xmath42 .",
    "the experimentally measured pc conductance data can be compared with this model using as input parameters the energy gap @xmath33 , the parameter @xmath43 ( measure of the interface barrier strength with transmission coefficient @xmath44 ) , and a parameter @xmath45 for the quasi - particle lifetime broadening of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure is described for example in ref.@xcite .",
    "when a point - contact micro - constriction is formed between a normal metal and a strongly coupled superconductor , due to significant energy dependence of the superconducting gap @xmath46 a small negative correction to the elastic excess current @xmath47 caused by the andreev reflection will make a measurable effect @xcite .",
    "generally , the pc current will read as    @xmath48    where the first three terms are described above and the last term is given as @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is a characteristic frequency of phonons mediating the superconducting pairing .",
    "this term exceeds the inelastic component of the pc current and the electron - phonon interaction modes mediating superconductivity can be visible in the second derivative @xmath51 as peaks not exactly at characteristic epi energies , but , importantly , shifted to higher energies by the value of the superconducting energy gap @xmath33 , in the same way as in the tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "when the gap is closed for example by increasing temperature or in applied magnetic field , the epi peaks should move to lower energies following the gap and decrease their intensity .",
    "this would be a smoking gun for the coupling mode which mediates the superconductivity in the system .",
    "the measurements presented in this paper were performed on high - quality single - crystalline yb@xmath0 samples prepared by the traveling solvent floating zone method @xcite .",
    "all measurements were performed on crystals from the same batch .",
    "the crystals had a cubic form with the edge of about 0.5 mm .",
    "the values of the critical temperature @xmath10 have been determined by the point - contact - spectroscopy , resistivity and ac - calorimetry specific - heat measurements @xcite .",
    "the first two techniques give @xmath52 k and the specific heat measurements sensitive to the bulk of the sample yield from the entropy balance construction around the anomaly @xmath10 = 7.32 k , a reasonably close value .",
    "the point - contact micro - constrictions were formed in - situ by pressing a pt tip on the yb@xmath0 surface using a differential screw mechanism allowing for a positioning of the tip on different spots on the sample .",
    "the pc tips have been cut off from 50 @xmath53 m pt wires .",
    "spectra with the best resolution have been obtained on the shiny blue yb@xmath0 surfaces prepared by cleaving before cooling down in the cryostat .",
    "pc spectroscopy measurements ( the first and second derivatives of @xmath27 characteristics ) have been realized by the standard lock - in modulation technique @xcite .",
    "pc resistances were typically in the range @xmath54 .",
    "as shown in our previous short communication @xcite in some point contacts with largest pc resistances a small gap below the bcs limit was observed . in those junctions also",
    "a non bcs temperature dependence of the gap had been obtained typical of the proximity effect from the bulk to the degraded surface layer . here , we have collected a large number of point contacts showing no signature of proximity effect and with a very little scattered gap size .",
    "the representative examples of the point - contact spectra @xmath38 obtained at @xmath55 k are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the lines display the experimental data after normalization to the normal - state pc conductance , measured above the transition temperature @xmath10 or above the upper - critical - field value @xmath56 .",
    "the open symbols represent the fits by the btk model . although our experiments have been performed on freshly cleaved yb@xmath0 surfaces , the finite @xmath43 parameter has always been found . its size scattered as @xmath57 .",
    "it means that there is always an effective interface barrier between the pt tip and the sample . in some cases we were able to form point contacts with a high spectral resolution , as witnessed by a small value of the smearing parameter @xmath58 obtained from the fits .",
    "for the three spectra shown in fig . 1 from top downwards the values of @xmath45 achieved 5 , 13 and 37 @xmath59 of the gap values , respectively .",
    "the values of the superconducting gap obtained at 4.2 k on many junctions have been scattered between 1.18 to 1.22 mev .",

    "the lower curves are shifted in y - coordinates for the clarity .",
    "fits by the btk conductances are shown by open symbols with the resulting parameters @xmath61 mev and @xmath33(4.2 k ) = 1.18 , 1.22 , 1.20 mev from top to bottom , respectively.,width=10 ]    point - contact spectroscopy explores superconductivity in the area with dimensions on the order of the superconducting coherence length . in some cases",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 at the surface can differ from the bulk value .",
    "that is why it is important to determine the local @xmath10 of the junction before making any conclusions on such important parameter as the superconducting coupling strength @xmath62 . in the published spectroscopy measurements on yb@xmath0",
    "the local critical temperature @xmath10 values have not always been determined , which could affect the calculation of the coupling strength .",
    "a correct determination of this ratio requires experimental measurement of @xmath10 and @xmath63 in the same experiment .    a representative temperature dependence of the pc spectra is plotted in fig .",
    "2 ( lines ) .",
    "this is one of the high resolution spectra without any smearing parameter ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the open circles are obtained from the fits to the btk model . during the fitting procedure we first determined the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath43 at the lowest temperature , here equal to 1.6 k. later , for higher temperatures only @xmath33 was used as a fit parameter , while @xmath43 we had been kept constant .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows the temperature dependence of the superconducting energy gap determined from the fit .",
    "the energy gap @xmath65 mev closes at the critical temperature @xmath66 k leading to the coupling strength of @xmath67 . note that from a number of measurements we always obtained @xmath10 close to @xmath68 k. the transition temperature was determined either by noting when the pc conductance no longer displayed energy - gap features or by extrapolating the temperature dependence of the gap to its zero value .",
    "the zero - temperature energy gap value was obtained either by extrapolating the temperature dependence of @xmath33 to the zero temperature or by the measurements below 2 k where no extrapolation was necessary . as a result of many measurements",
    "we have obtained the superconducting gap @xmath33(0 ) = 1.30 @xmath69 mev and @xmath15 values between 3.9 and 4.1 .",
    "we can conclude that in yb@xmath0 the point - contact spectroscopy has revealed a single @xmath14-wave - gap superconductivity with intermediate strength of coupling .",

    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicularly to the pc junction area and parallel with a pt tip .",
    "the estimated pc diameters were in the range of hundreds of nanometers while the coherence length in yb@xmath0 is about 30 nm .",
    "then , above the lower critical magnetic field the junction was in a mixed state with many abrikosov vortices penetrating the junction .",
    "the vortex cores form a normal - state part @xmath73 of the junction with an area @xmath74 .",
    "their fraction of the whole junction written as @xmath75 is in a first approximation proportional to the applied field divided to the upper critical one ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "@xmath77 increases linearly with magnetic field and at the upper critical magnetic field where the whole junction is in the normal state @xmath78 .",
    "the normalized point - contact conductance in the mixed state will be the sum @xmath79 , where @xmath77 represents the normal - state channel and @xmath80 is the superconducting - channel contribution .",
    "this simple empirical model ( successfully applied for the study of two - gap superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 @xcite ) has been used for the fit of the normalized - conductance curves measured in a presence of magnetic field .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of one pc spectrum with magnetic field ( lines ) and fitting curves ( symbols ) .",
    "the fit parameters @xmath81 and @xmath63 have been determined from the zero - field pc spectrum . at higher fields",
    "only the values of the field - dependent parameters @xmath77 and @xmath33 have been varied .",
    "the resulting field dependence of the energy gap is plotted by the open circles in the fig .",
    "5 . from relatively small fields it follows a square - root dependence , which is in accordance with the maki s @xcite generalization of the ginzburg - landau theory for dirty type - ii superconductors .",
    "similar measurements have been performed at 1.6 k. thus , @xmath56 values , determined from the pc spectroscopy as the field where the superconducting features in the pc spectrum vanish , were obtained at these two temperatures .",
    "they are shown in the inset of fig . 3 by the stars together with the overall temperature dependence of the upper critical magnetic field @xmath82 determined from the specific heat measurements performed on the same crystal , displayed here as solid squares @xcite .",
    "the consistency between @xmath56 s obtained from the bulk - sensitive specific heat measurements and surface sensitive point - contact - spectroscopy measurements points the fact that also the latter reflects the bulk properties and is not affected by any kind of surface degradation .",

    "our @xmath56 values are in a reasonable agreement with the results of other groups @xcite .",

    "4 ( right ordinate applies).,width=8 ]    as has been discussed above , the point - contact spectroscopy is capable to explore the electron - phonon interaction in superconductors either due to inelastic quasi - particle scattering on phonons , or due to energy dependent superconducting energy gap present in the elastic component of the point - contact spectra . in both mechanisms",
    "the second derivative @xmath28 is proportional to the epi function .",
    "the first mechanism requires clean ballistic contacts and reveals approximately the same spectrum in the superconducting as well as in the normal state .",
    "the latter mechanism prevails in the strongly - coupled superconductors , where intensity of the peaks in @xmath88 related to the phonons ( bosons ) mediating the superconducting coupling is significantly increased in the superconducting state as compared with the normal state and moreover , the peak positions are shifted in energies by the value of the superconducting energy gap @xmath33 . with a relatively strong superconducting coupling of @xmath89 in our yb@xmath0 samples we expected that strong coupling features could also appear in the elastic component at the characteristic phonon energies . by trial and error",
    "we looked for the @xmath90 spectra showing a smooth linearly increasing background , a typical feature of a good quality metallic point contacts with more direct than tunneling conductance .",
    "figure 4 plots a set of second derivatives @xmath91 of the point - contact spectra obtained at @xmath55 k in the superconducting as well as the normal state of a pt - yb@xmath0 hetero - contact .",
    "the curves taken at @xmath92 t show the spectra measured in the superconducting state and mixed state , respectively , while the spectrum taken at @xmath93 t , above the value of the upper critical magnetic field @xmath56(4.2 k ) = 0.18 t ( see inset of fig .",
    "3 ) , represents the normal - state behavior .",
    "all spectra shown here reveal well defined nonlinearities in the 30 mv window .",
    "in the zero - field spectrum a sharp peak is visible at the bias ( energy ) @xmath94 = 8.6 mv , an intense peak is placed also around @xmath95 13 mv followed by a hump at about 18 mv and a peak around @xmath96 23 mv . the structure is superimposed on the typical point - contact background which is related to the nonequilibrium phonon generation near the point - contact orifice @xcite .",
    "point - contact spectra measured through a junction between two different metals are proportional to the epi function of both electrodes . for comparison",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 also the point - contact spectrum of the electron - phonon interaction obtained on the pt homo - contact , the curve is reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite . in this spectrum",
    "the pc background was already subtracted .",
    "two dominant pt phonon modes are visible with peaks at @xmath97 13 mv and 23 mv and also a hump at about 18 mv can be recognized . comparing the yb@xmath0-pt zero - field spectrum with the spectrum of pt one",
    "can see that the maxima observed above 10 mv are positioned at the characteristic phonon energies of pt without any energy shift .",
    "when the superconductivity in our yb@xmath0 sample is suppressed in increasing magnetic field , the intensities and the positions of these maxima are practically unchanged .",
    "this is strongly suggestive that in our pc spectra the inelastic scattering of electrons on the pt phonons dominates at energies above 10 mev .",
    "on the other hand the low - energy sharp peak observed in the superconducting state at @xmath98 mv changes clearly in applied magnetic field .",
    "the intensity of this peak is reduced in the increased field and a gradual shift of its position is visible from @xmath99 8.6 mv to @xmath97 7.6 mv in the normal state , where the peak transforms to a shoulder .",
    "such a shift of the energy position between the spectra in the superconducting and normal states indicates that this is the mode mediating superconducting coupling .",
    "a detailed comparison of this shit with a progressive reduction of the superconducting energy gap in magnetic field is shown in figure 5 .",
    "clearly , the phonon - peak position ( solid symbols ) follows the suppression of the energy gap @xmath100 ( open symbols ) in increasing magnetic field . at higher fields , above @xmath56 the phonon contribution in the spectrum due to",
    "the energy - dependent superconducting gap is absent and a small non - linearity at about 7.6 mv which is still present as dispalyed in fig .",
    "4 is due to an inelastic quasi - particle scattering on this phonon mode .",
    "it is visible together with the phonon modes of the pt tip .",
    "in contrast to the reports in refs.@xcite no structure was observed at @xmath101 mev in any of the several junctions revealing detectable non - linearities in the @xmath28 spectra on our pt - yb@xmath0 hetero - contacts . yet",
    "no structures apart of the smoothly increasing background was observed at higher voltages above 30 mv .",
    "it is noteworthy that that our measurements have revealed only the strongest peak of the complete epi spectrum of yb@xmath0 , while the other branches due to the quasiparticle interactions with the optical phonon modes of the boron octahedra are not pronounced . that they have been observed in our pcs studies on the non - superconducting lab@xmath0 @xcite",
    "can be explained by the extremely high quality of the lab@xmath0 crystal with the residual resistivity ratio rrr @xmath102 200 while in the case of yb@xmath0 rrr = 4 . in the case of our point contact measurements on the lub@xmath103 single crystals with rrr",
    "= 70 we have observed a dominant epi peak at about 14 mev coming from lu vibrations and two small maxima at 24 and 30 mev from optical boron branches @xcite .",
    "our finding strongly suggests importance of the low - energy yttrium phonon mode with energy of 7.6 mev in the superconducting coupling of yb@xmath0 , while other phonon modes coming from the boron octahedra vibrations are not significantly coupled to the electronic quasi - particles .",
    "this result is in a full agreement with the conclusions of the `` thermal spectroscopy '' of lortz _ _ et al . _ _",
    "@xcite based on the heat capacity and resistivity measurements .",
    "point - contact spectroscopy measurements have been performed to study the superconducting coupling in yb@xmath0 .",
    "the values of the superconducting energy gap @xmath104 mev and of the strength of superconductivity @xmath105 have been determined .",
    "we have shown , that while the maxima of @xmath91 spectra observed on the pt - yb@xmath0 point contacts at energies above 10 mv are related to the inelastic scattering of electrons on the phonons of the pt tip the low - energy mode , observed in the superconducting state at 8.6 mv is shifted to lower energies in the same way as the superconducting energy gap of yb@xmath0 is gradually suppressed by the magnetic field and shows up as a small feature at 7.6 mev when yb@xmath0 is driven to the normal state .",
    "this finding is a direct experimental evidence of the phonon - mediated superconductivity in yb@xmath0 by the low energy yttrium phonon mode near 7.6 mev .",

    "<S> as a result the normalized superconducting gap reveals a strong coupling with @xmath1 and moreover the spectra contain nonlinearities typical of the electron - phonon interaction at energies around 8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the in - magnetic - field measurements evidence that the phonon features found in the second derivative of the current - voltage characteristics are due to the energy dependence of the superconducting energy gap as their energy position shrinks equally as the gap is closing . </S>",
    "<S> this is a direct proof that the superconducting coupling in the system is due to the low energy einstein - like phonon mode associated with the yttrium ion vibrations in a perfect agreement with determinations from bulk measurements . </S>"
