    "the standard cosmology was lack of a mechanism to produce cosmological perturbations . in order to compensate for this flaw in the standard model , there are currently two main paradigms for structure formation  inflation @xcite and topological defects @xcite . while the beauty and simplicity of the former appears to have enticed more adherents and studies , the latter has proved computationally much more challenging to make robust predictions with which to confront observations @xcite .",
    "these two paradigms are fundamentally different in the way they generate cosmological perturbations .",
    "the standard adiabatic inflation produces primordial perturbations on all scales of cosmological interest via quantum fluctuations and the causal constraint during inflation , and these perturbations grow over time in an uncorrelated manner . as a consequence",
    ", the perturbations today can be thought of as simply transfered from the initial irregularities that inflation set up , and this transfer function can be easily obtained in the linear theory and thus well understood in the literature . on the other hand ,",
    "topological defects are the byproducts of the spontaneous symmetry - breaking phase transition in the early universe , and hence carry energy that was carved out of the originally homogeneous background energy of the universe . therefore due to causality",
    ", defects induce perturbations only on sub - horizon scales , via gravitational interactions while evolving .",
    "this mechanism that prevents the growth of super - horizon perturbations is called the ` compensation mechanism ' . in addition , due to the certain topology of the defect network , the resulting perturbations are correlated and thus non - gaussian , in contrast to the standard adiabatic inflationary perturbations .",
    "it then follows that to compute the perturbations in models with defects , we need to know the evolution history of defects for the entire dynamic range during which the cosmological perturbations of our interest were seeded .",
    "this is what makes the computation of defect - induced perturbations so difficult .    in the literature",
    "the power spectra of this kind of models have been investigated using the full einstein - boltzmann equations .",
    "however , the study of the phase information of these perturbations still remains difficult because of the limited computation power .",
    "although there have been some detailed treatments for theories with causal seeds @xcite , we shall in this paper present a simpler formalism , which is an approximation to the full einstein - boltzmann equations , to provide not only a physically transparent way for understanding the evolution of density perturbations in models with source , but also a computationally economical scheme to investigate the phase information of the resulting cosmological perturbations .",
    "this formalism is parallel to those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , but we give some modifications to incorporate the inclusion of the cosmological constant and a more detailed treatment for the effect of baryon - photon coupling / decoupling .",
    "we also note that part of the solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite are incorrect due to the incorrect initial conditions and the incorrect assumptions about the form of the subsequent perturbations induced by the source ( see text later ) .",
    "we shall correct these mistakes and further provide a complete and explicit set of analytic solutions for the matter density perturbations . with an accurate extrapolation scheme ,",
    "these solutions become also valid for models with any reasonably chosen background cosmology . the formalism and its solutions to be developed here",
    "will be completely general and thus suitable for any models with or without causal / acausal source .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ synchronous_gauge_perturbation_theory ] , under the fluid approximation",
    ", we first derive in the synchronous gauge the full perturbation equations with source terms , in flat cosmologies with a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "this is done by considering the stress - energy conservation of the fluids ( [ conservation - rad - mat ] ) and the source ( [ conservation - seeds ] ) , and the linearly perturbed einstein equations ( [ perturbed - einstein ] ) .",
    "the fluid components considered here are cold dark matter ( cdm ) , baryons ( b ) , and photons ( @xmath3 ) , and we employ the baryon - photon tight - coupling approximation to derive the perturbation equations before the last - scattering epoch . in this context , we also investigate the role of the so - called stress - energy pseudotensor ( [ conservation - pseudo ] ) . the initial conditions of these perturbation equations are discussed ( [ initial - conditions ] ) , and we use the approximation of instantaneous decoupling to deal with the decoupling of photons and baryons at the epoch of last scattering ( [ instantaneous - decoupling ] ) .",
    "we then numerically justify the accuracy of this formalism in the context of standard cdm models , by comparing its results with those of the full einstein - boltzmann solver @xcite ( [ verification - stdcdm ] ) . within reasonable ranges of cosmological parameters",
    ", our approach provides satisfactory precision at greatly reduced numerical cost .    in section",
    "[ solutions - of - matter - perturbations ] , we derive the matter perturbation solutions of the equations presented in section  [ synchronous_gauge_perturbation_theory ] .",
    "the perturbations of radiation and matter are first divided into two parts : the initial and the subsequent perturbations . with some change of variables ,",
    "these equations are then ready to be solved by the green - function technique ( [ evolution - equations - and - decomposition - of - perturbation ] ) . with this technique",
    ", we find the exact solutions on scales much larger or much smaller than the horizon size , namely the super - horizon or the sub - horizon solutions respectively ( [ super - horizon - and - sub - horizon - modes ] ) .",
    "some degeneracy among the green functions for the matter perturbation solutions is then found and used to reduce their effective number ( [ degeneracy - of - the - green - functions ] ) . with this great simplification , solutions on intermediate scales",
    "are then easily obtained by an accurate interpolation scheme based on the well - known standard cdm transfer function ( [ solutions - on - intermediate - scales ] ) .",
    "we also discuss the effect of baryons ( [ the - effect - of - baryons ] ) .",
    "a simple and accurate extrapolation scheme is then introduced to obtain solutions in the @xmath4 or @xmath2 cosmologies ( [ k - neq-0-or - l - neq-0-models ] ) , where @xmath5 is the curvature of the universe ( see appendix  [ background_cosmologies ] ) .",
    "all our green - function solutions are numerically verified to high accuracy .    in section  [ important - properties ] , we use our green - function solutions to investigate some important properties of cosmological matter density perturbations .",
    "we first demonstrate the relation between our solutions and the standard cdm transfer function ( [ the - standard - cdm - model ] ) .",
    "we also prove that in models with causal source , the resulting matter perturbations today are independent of the way the source energy is initially compensated into the background contents of the universe ( [ independence - of - the - initial - conditions ] ) .",
    "finally we use our green - function solutions to study the compensation mechanism and the scale on which it operates ( [ compensation - and - total - matter - perturbations ] ) .",
    "we find that this compensation scale is determined not only by the dynamics of the universe , but also by the properties of the source near the horizon scale .",
    "once the detailed features of the source near the horizon scale are known , this compensation scale can be accurately located using our green functions .",
    "a summary and conclusion is given in section  [ matpert - conclusion ] . in appendix  [ background_cosmologies ] , we define the convention of some notations used in this paper , and present for reference the solutions for the dynamics of various background cosmologies , including the consideration of non - zero curvature and a cosmological constant .",
    "in this section , we derive the linear evolution equations for cosmological perturbations . to calculate the density and metric perturbations , we model the contents of the universe as perfect fluids : radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) and pressureless matter ( cdm and baryons ) .",
    "we shall use the photon - baryon tight - coupling approximation until the epoch of last scattering , at which we assume instantaneous decoupling , also taking into account the effect of silk damping due to the photon diffusion .",
    "after the decoupling , the baryonic perturbations originating from the perturbations of the photon - baryon coupled fluid are then merged linearly into the cdm content . in scenarios with causal seeds ,",
    "the radiation and matter fields are assumed to be initially uniform , and then perturbed by the causal seeds after they are formed .",
    "the radiation , matter , and causal seeds are assumed to interact only through gravity , meaning that their stress - energy tensors are separately covariantly conserved .",
    "we shall work in the synchronous gauge , in which the perturbations @xmath6 to the spacetime metric @xmath7 obey the constraint @xmath8 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use a signature @xmath9 for the spacetime metric , and units in which @xmath10 .",
    "thus the perturbed flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric is given by @xmath11.\\ ] ] we shall work in the linear theory , requiring @xmath12 .",
    "greek alphabet will denote the spacetime indices ( e.g.  @xmath13 ) , and mid - alphabet latin letters the spatial indices ( e.g.  @xmath14 ) . although the synchronous gauge is sometimes criticised in the literature due to its residual gauge freedom , it is still well suited to models in which the universe evolves from being perfectly homogeneous and isotropic . in such models ,",
    "all perturbation variables can be initially set to zero ( before the causal seeds are generated ) , and this is normally referred to as the ` initially unperturbed synchronous gauge ' ( iusg ) @xcite .",
    "it possesses no residual gauge freedom .",
    "thus the einstein equations are completely causal in iusg , with the values of all perturbation variables at a given spacetime point being completely determined by initial conditions within the past light cone of the point .",
    "one example of such models is the cosmic defect models , which have been of most interest in the study of models with causal seeds .    in section  [ conservation - rad - mat ] , we derive in the iusg the conservation equations of radiation and matter fields . in section  [ conservation - seeds ] , we consider the conservation of source stress energy . in section  [ perturbed - einstein ] , we derive the linearly perturbed einstein equations .",
    "then , in section  [ conservation - pseudo ] , we employ the concept of stress - energy pseudotensor to investigate the internal energy transfer among various fields . in section  [ instantaneous - decoupling ] , we describe the approximation of instantaneous decoupling of photons and baryons at the epoch of last scattering . in section  [ verification - stdcdm ] , we numerically verify the accuracy of our formalism for the standard cdm model , in comparison with the results from cmbfast @xcite , a fast einstein - boltzmann solver .",
    "the contents of the universe are considered as perfect fluids , whose energy - momentum tensors have the form @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the density , pressure , and four - velocity of the @xmath19th fluid respectively . in the homogeneous background , we have @xmath20 , which implies that @xmath21 to first order .",
    "we thus define the velocity perturbation as @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "the equation of state and the sound speed are defined respectively as @xmath24 consequently , the covariant conservation of stress energy for each fluid @xmath25 gives @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the spatial trace of @xmath6 , and we have decomposed the velocities as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in the regime of photon - baryon tight coupling , we have only two main fluids : the cdm component and the tightly - coupled photon - baryon fluid . they will be denoted as @xmath32 respectively , and discussed separately as follows .",
    "note that we have ignored the neutrinos in the radiation .",
    "we first consider the cdm fluid , i.e.  @xmath33 . with @xmath34 for pressureless matter ,",
    "the equations of stress - energy conservation ( [ conserve-1])([conserve-3 ] ) become @xmath35 as we can see , any perturbations in the cdm velocity will decay as @xmath36 .",
    "thus we can simply choose @xmath37 in the iusg .",
    "once @xmath37 , it will remain so as there is no linear gravitational source .",
    "as a consequence , the cdm obeys a single nontrivial conservation law resulting from equation ( [ conserve - c0 ] ) @xmath38 where the second equation results from the initial condition @xmath39 , as required by the iusg .      for the tightly - coupled photon - baryon ( @xmath40 ) fluid",
    ", we have @xmath41 thus we can define @xmath42 where the second result comes from the fact that @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". definitions ( [ eqn - of - state ] ) then give @xmath45 with these results , the equations of stress - energy conservation for the @xmath40 fluid can be obtained from equations ( [ conserve-1])([conserve-3 ] ) : @xmath46 in cosmological applications , such as cmb anisotropies , we are more interested in the photon perturbations rather than the perturbations in the @xmath47 fluid . therefore by using equations ( [ v - p - rho - gammab ] ) and ( [ r - gammab ] ) , we can extract the photon component from the above equations to yield @xcite @xmath48 where we have ignored neutrinos in the radiation so as to replace the subscript @xmath3 with @xmath49 .",
    "the velocity can then be eliminated to yield a single second - order equation : @xmath50 we note that although the photon velocities are missing in this equation , they can be recovered at any given moment using equation  ( [ conserve - r1 ] ) .",
    "an alternative presentation of equations ( [ conserve - r1 ] ) and ( [ conserve - r ] ) is via the entropy perturbation @xmath51 .",
    "it is defined as the fluctuation in the number of photons per dark matter particle @xmath52 thus equations ( [ conserve - r1 ] ) and ( [ conserve - r ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath53 as we shall see , @xmath54 can only have a white noise power spectrum on super - horizon scales . from equation ( [ conserve - r2 ] ) , this implies a @xmath55 power spectrum in @xmath56 on these scales .",
    "adding the fact that the entropy fluctuation @xmath51 starts from zero on super - horizon scales due to the fixed number of dark matter particles per photon , it then follows from equation ( [ entropy1 ] ) that both @xmath51 and @xmath57 have a @xmath58 fall off outside the horizon .",
    "therefore in numerical simulations , as long as the initial horizon size is smaller than the scales of our interest , we can simply set @xmath59 as part of the initial condition .",
    "the causal source we shall consider is weak , so it will appear only as first - order terms in the perturbed einstein equations .",
    "thus in the linear theory we are considering here , they can be treated as being stiff , meaning that their evolution depends only on their own self - interactions and the background dynamics of the universe , but not on their self - gravity or on the weak gravitational field of the inhomogeneities they produce .",
    "this assumption will enable us to separate the calculation of their dynamics from that of the inhomogeneities they induce , allowing us to evolve them as if they are in a completely homogeneous background . since the source is stiff , its energy - momentum tensor @xmath60",
    "need only be locally covariantly conserved with respect to the background : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "another important aspect of cosmic structure formation with causal seeds like cosmic defects is the fact that the sources , formed at very early times , will ultimately create under - densities in the initially homogeneous background , out of which they are carved .",
    "this is a direct result of energy conservation in the universe , and is normally termed ` compensation ' .",
    "we shall discuss this issue in more detail later .",
    "at first we have ten einstein equations @xmath63 or equivalently , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the ricci tensor , @xmath66 is the gravitational constant , @xmath67 , @xmath0 is the cosmological constant , @xmath68 is the einstein tensor , and @xmath69 is the scalar curvature . linearly perturbing the above equations , we obtain @xmath70 or equivalently , @xmath71 where @xmath72 a closed set of the ten linearly perturbed einstein equations are then @xmath73 \\tilde{h}_{ij}\\right\\ }    & = &    \\ddot{\\tilde{h}}_{ij}+2{\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}}\\dot{\\tilde{h}}_{ij }    -\\nabla^2 { \\tilde{h}}_{ij}-{\\frac{1}{3}}h_{,ij }    + { \\frac{1}{9}}\\delta_{ij}\\nabla^2 h    \\nonumber\\\\    & &     + \\tilde{h}_{ik , kj }    + \\tilde{h}_{jk , ki}-{\\frac{2}{3}}\\delta_{ij}\\tilde{h}_{kl , kl }    = 16\\pi g\\tilde{\\theta}_{ij } + a^2 \\lambda \\tilde{h}_{ij}\\ ; ,    \\label{deinstein2}\\\\    2\\delta g_{00 }     = \\tilde{h}_{ij , ij}-{\\frac{2}{3}}\\nabla^2h+2{\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}}\\dot{h }    & = &    6\\left({\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}}\\right)^2    \\sum_n \\omega_n\\delta_n    + 16\\pi g\\theta_{00}\\ ; ,    \\label{deinstein3}\\\\    2\\delta g_{0i }    =   \\dot{\\tilde{h}}_{ij , j}-{\\frac{2}{3}}\\dot{h}_{,i }    & = &    -6\\left({\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}}\\right)^2    { \\sum_n } ' ( 1+\\kappa_{\\scriptscriptstyle n})\\omega_n v^i_{\\scriptscriptstyle n }    + 16\\pi g\\theta_{0i}\\ ; ,    \\label{deinstein4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the traceless parts are defined by @xmath74 , and similarly for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "the source is absent , equation ( [ einstein1 ] ) can be greatly simplified on super - horizon scales ( @xmath79 ) in the radiation or matter era : @xmath80 since @xmath81 by definition , we know @xmath82 deep in the radiation era .",
    "thus the above equations both have a growing mode @xmath83 .",
    "this result has an important implication for numerical simulations of structure formation with causal sources . in this case ,",
    "if numerical errors appear as white noise on super - horizon modes @xmath84 , then they will have a growing behavior @xmath85 .",
    "for the horizon crossing mode @xmath86 , this becomes @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "this means that although energy conservation together with causality should forbid the growth of perturbations on super - horizon scales , any numerical errors seeded from early times would induce a spurious growing mode on these scales . to overcome this problem",
    ", one needs to perfectly compensate the source energy in the initially homogeneous background . in the following section",
    ", we shall discuss one of the methods that can achieve this .",
    "the concept of the stress - energy pseudotensor in an expanding universe was first remarked in this context by veeraraghavan and stebbins @xcite , and further investigated by pen , spergel and turok @xcite . to introduce this concept ,",
    "we start from a perturbed minkowski space @xmath88 , where the bianchi identity @xmath89 leads to an ordinary conservation law @xmath90 at linear order in @xmath91 .",
    "adding the fact that the einstein equations give @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the sum of non - linear terms in @xmath91 , we see that the right - hand side of this equation provides an ordinarily conserved tensor , the stress - energy pseudotensor .    the generalization of this result to an frw model is straightforward , with only the corrections due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "moving all these corrections ( derivatives of the scale factor ) to the right - hand side of the einstein equations while keeping only the linear terms in @xmath94 , we obtain a pseudo - stress - energy tensor @xmath95 : @xmath96    -\\frac{1}{8 \\pi g}\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\dot{h}+\\theta_{00 } \\ ; ,     \\label{tau00}\\\\    \\tau_{0i }    & = &    -\\frac{1}{2\\pi g}\\left({\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}}\\right)^2    ( 1+r)\\omega_{\\rm r } v_{\\rm r}^i+\\theta_{0i } \\ ; ,     \\label{tau0i}\\\\    \\tau_{ij }    & = &    \\delta_{ij }    \\frac{1}{8 \\pi g}\\left({\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}}\\right)^2    \\omega_{\\rm r}\\delta_{\\rm r }    -\\frac{1}{8 \\pi g }    \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}(\\dot{\\tilde{h}}_{ij}-\\frac{2}{3}\\dot{h}\\delta_{ij } )    + \\theta_{ij}\\;.    \\label{tauij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this tensor obeys an ordinary conservation law @xmath97 according to the einstein equations , or equivalently @xmath98 this is not a fundamentally new conservation law , but it describes the interchange of energy and momentum among the different components in the universe , i.e.   the radiation , matter , and the source in our case .",
    "this description appears to be physically more transparent than the original einstein equations .",
    "another advantage of invoking this formalism is that it is easier for numerical simulations to specify the initial conditions and to maintain proper compensation on super - horizon scales . as we shall explain later",
    ", @xmath99 can only have a white - noise power spectrum on super - horizon scales . thus integrating equations ( [ conserve - tau1 ] ) and ( [ conserve - tau2 ] ) over time shows that @xmath100 has a @xmath58 power spectrum and that @xmath101 has a @xmath55 power spectrum .",
    "therefore , as long as the horizon size at the beginning of the simulation is smaller than the scales of our interest , we can set @xmath102 as the initial condition , allowing for perturbations to grow only inside the horizon and for @xmath100 to fall off as @xmath58 outside the horizon . for simulations of structure formation with causal source ,",
    "a check of @xmath103 on super - horizon modes will tell us whether or not the compensation is well obeyed .    to make use of the pseudo - stress - energy tensor formalism in the study of cosmological perturbations ,",
    "we combine the conservation equation for radiation ( [ entropy2 ] ) , the definition of pseudoenergy ( [ tau00 ] ) , and one of the alternative einstein equations using the pseudo - stress - energy tensor ( [ conserve - tau1 ] ) , to yield a convenient closed set of equations : @xmath104    \\delta_{\\rm c}+    2(1+r)\\omega_{{\\rm r}}s    \\right\\ } ,     \\label{density - eqn2}\\\\    \\dot{\\tau}_{00 }    & = & \\theta_{0i , i}+ \\frac{1}{2\\pi g}\\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2    ( 1+r)\\omega_{{\\rm r}}\\dot{s}\\;.    \\label{density - eqn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used equations ( [ conserve - c ] ) , ( [ entropy ] ) , ( [ entropy1 ] ) and ( [ tau0i ] ) to eliminate @xmath105 , @xmath54 , @xmath106 and @xmath101 respectively . by analogy to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we have built both the pseudoenergy @xmath100 and the entropy fluctuation @xmath51 into the above formalism .",
    "as required by the iusg , all perturbation variables are zero before any mechanism of structure formation starts to act on the initially homogeneous and isotropic universe . in causal models",
    ", causality also requires that local physical processes can never induce correlated perturbations on scales much larger than the horizon .",
    "therefore , when the initial irregularities of the universe are first formed ( e.g.  via the formation of cosmic defects , or the presence of inflation ) , the spatial part of @xmath60 , @xmath107 and @xmath6 can only have white - noise power spectra on super - horizon modes  their spatial perturbations being uncorrelated on scales larger than the horizon size @xcite .",
    "the same applies to @xmath108 and therefore @xmath109 .",
    "it then follows from equations ( [ conserve - r2 ] ) , ( [ conserve - seed2 ] ) and ( [ conserve - tau2 ] ) respectively that the power spectra of @xmath56 , @xmath110 and @xmath101 all fall off as @xmath55 outside the horizon . from equations ( [ entropy1 ] ) and ( [ conserve - tau1 ] ) , we also have the spectra of @xmath51 , @xmath57 and @xmath100 proportional to @xmath58 on these scales , as previously discussed . as a summary , we have for super - horizon modes @xmath111 that @xmath112 where ` @xmath113 ' means the power spectrum is proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "since the production time of the initial irregularities is normally so early that the horizon size @xmath115 at that time is much smaller than the cosmological scales @xmath116 of our interest ( i.e.  @xmath117 ) , the above conditions can be regarded as general initial conditions for all scales of cosmological interest .",
    "if we require @xmath118 in our analysis , we can simply choose @xmath119 as the initial conditions , because their power spectra all decay as either @xmath55 or @xmath58 outside the horizon .",
    "with such a choice , we can see from equation ( [ tau00 ] ) that there is still freedom for the choice of @xmath120 , @xmath54 and @xmath105 into which to compensate @xmath121 when @xmath121 was first formed .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall analytically prove later , no matter how @xmath121 was compensated into the background contents of the universe when the causal source was first formed , the resulting matter density perturbations today would be the same .",
    "we note that this was first numerically observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and here we shall provide a thorough interpretation to it using our analytical solutions to be obtained later . we also note that none of the above arguments will hold if the initial perturbations are seeded in an acausal way , which is nevertheless not of our current interest .",
    "one thing we have not included in our formalism is the treatment at and after the decoupling epoch @xmath122 . before this epoch , photons and baryons",
    "are assumed to be tightly coupled , forming a single @xmath3b fluid . at the decoupling epoch @xmath122 , baryons and photons",
    "are assumed to be instantaneously decoupled from each other , so that @xmath123 and @xmath124 evolve separately afterwards .",
    "a numerical fit to the redshift of the decoupling epoch is @xcite @xmath125 ,    \\label{z - d}\\\\    b_1 & = & 0.313(\\omega_{\\rm m0}h^2)^{-0.419 }    \\left[1 + 0.607(\\omega_{\\rm m0}h^2)^{0.674}\\right],\\\\    b_2 & = & 0.238(\\omega_{\\rm m0}h^2)^{0.223}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although this is the result for the decoupling epoch of baryons and there is another fit for that of photons , these two epochs  the recombination of baryons and the last scattering of photons  coincide approximately in the absence of subsequent reionization @xcite .",

    "we notice that @xmath293 merges with @xmath296 at the boundary of regions i and ii , where @xmath297 . in region",
    "iii , the solution along the @xmath128 direction is in the same form as the standard cdm transfer function .",
    "this is because modes with larger @xmath128 cross the horizon earlier , so that their perturbations are suppressed after the horizon crossing for longer until @xmath294 .",
    "in addition , the solution along the @xmath115 direction in region iii is in the same form as @xmath293 .",
    "this is because modes in this region are initially on super - horizon scales , and a given mode with different initial time @xmath115 will experience the same amount of suppression resulting from the period between the horizon crossing and @xmath294 .",
    "therefore , regions i , ii and iii illustrate the intrinsic property of the solution ( [ gc ] ) .",
    "there is one important issue which we have not discussed ",
    "the effect of baryons .",
    "prior to the photon - baryon decoupling at @xmath122 , the cdm and baryons are dynamically independent . in this era , the photon - baryon fluid propagates as acoustic waves with a sound speed given by equation  ( [ c_gammab ] ) , preventing baryons from collapsing on small scales .",
    "therefore there exists a sound horizon at the decoupling epoch @xmath298 ( hereafter simply the sound horizon ) which is the distance such waves can travel prior to @xmath122 , and which is the largest scale at which the baryons can affect the evolution of density perturbations .",
    "it has been shown that inside the sound horizon @xmath298 , not only are the cdm perturbations seeded before @xmath122 suppressed due to the presence of baryons ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but also the baryons themselves have an exponentially decaying power due to the silk damping @xcite ( see also eq .  [ [ damping - effects ] ] ) , with acoustic oscillations due to the velocity overshoot @xcite .",
    "after the decoupling , baryons evolve in the same way as the cdm does , so the matter perturbations today can be obtained by linearly combining the cdm and baryonic fluctuations at @xmath122 ( see section  [ instantaneous - decoupling ] and eq .",
    "[ [ delta - m - decoupling ] ] ) , and then evolving them to today .",
    "it follows that the baryonic effects tend to suppress the matter perturbations seeded before the decoupling epoch ( @xmath299 , see the horizontal dashed line in figure  [ fig - k - eta ] ) and on scales inside the sound horizon ( i.e.  for @xmath300 , see the vertical dashed line in figure  [ fig - k - eta ] ) . the perturbations seeded after @xmath122 or on scales @xmath301 will not be affected by the baryons . with this argument , we can impose a suppression factor on our current solution ( [ gc ] ) to account for the effect of baryons , i.e.  the solution with the inclusion of baryons can be written as @xmath302 where @xmath303 accounts for the baryonic suppression : @xmath304 where @xmath305 is the usual standard cdm transfer function with the baryonic dependence .",
    "one accurate fit of @xmath305 is provided in ref .",
    "we note that the ratio @xmath306 is unity outside the sound horizon ( @xmath307 ) , and is less than unity inside the sound horizon .",
    "referring to figure  [ fig - k - eta ] , equation ( [ b_k ] ) means that the value of @xmath303 is less than unity in the region to the right and above the dashed lines , and is unity otherwise .",
    "we also note that in the low-@xmath308 models , the sound horizon can be smaller than the radiation - matter equality horizon , i.e. , it is possible that @xmath309 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a transition era ( @xmath310 ) which is not included in equation ( [ b_k ] ) .",
    "this is because in this era the baryonic effects do not fully operate as in the regime @xmath311 so that a good fit is not trivial to obtain .",
    "we have numerically verified equation ( [ b_k ] ) , although an accurate fit to the missing era @xmath310 has yet to be found .",
    "the solutions we have obtained so far have assumed @xmath312 . for @xmath4 or @xmath2 ,",
    "the growing behavior of the cdm perturbations departs from that of a flat @xmath1 model only at very late times in the matter era ( see later for a more detailed argument ) .",
    "this allows us to apply a universal suppression factor on @xmath313 to account for the effects of curvature or @xmath0 : @xmath314 where @xmath128 is in units of @xmath315 , and @xmath316 is given by @xcite @xmath317}\\ .\\ ] ] in equation ( [ gcbol ] ) , the leading factor @xmath318 results from the fact that the ratio of scale factors @xmath319 is proportional to @xmath318 and that the green function @xmath320 is proportional to this ratio .",
    "the factor @xmath321 accounts for the suppression of the linear growth of density perturbations in a @xmath4 or @xmath0-universe relative to an @xmath322 and @xmath323 universe @xcite ( also verified in ref .",
    "the reason for @xmath128 to have the unit @xmath315 in equation ( [ gcbol ] ) is that the horizon size at radiation - matter equality @xmath294 is proportional to @xmath324 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eta_eq ] ] in appendix  [ background_cosmologies ] ) .    for @xmath4 or @xmath2 , the extrapolation scheme ( [ gcbol ] )",
    "will be inaccurate when @xmath174 is close to @xmath152 , i.e. , when the background dynamics at @xmath174 significantly departs from that of a flat @xmath1 model .",
    "nevertheless , this extrapolation scheme is still appropriate for most models with active source for two reasons .",
    "first , in the context of cosmic defects , the power of matter perturbations on the scales of our interest ( @xmath325@xmath326 ) is mainly seeded around @xmath294 ( see figure  [ scalefactor ] and the discussion after eq .",
    "[ [ tc0-i ] ] ) .",
    "at this time , the curvature or @xmath0 effects are negligible .",
    "second , at late times when the curvature or @xmath0 effects become important , these scales of our interest are already well inside the horizon so that any curvature terms in the perturbation equations can be neglected . therefore , the only required change in the perturbation equations to account for the effects of curvature or @xmath0 is simply to incorporate the correct background dynamics , and this involves only modifications in @xmath327 , @xmath328 and @xmath329 , whose solutions are given in appendix  [ background_cosmologies ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ scalefactor ] , the presence of curvature or a cosmological constant affects the background dynamics only at late times .",
    "more precisely , we verify that for @xmath330 and @xmath331 , the largest observable scale for matter perturbations @xmath332 corresponds to the horizon sizes at @xmath333 respectively , whereas in these models the curvature or cosmological - constant domination occurs only at a much later epoch when @xmath334 . at these moments ( @xmath333 )",
    ", the scale factor in the @xmath4 or @xmath2 models departs from that in the flat @xmath1 model only by less than one percent .",
    "indeed , we have numerically verified that the extrapolation scheme ( [ gcbol ] ) is accurate within a 5% error for @xmath335 and @xmath336 in @xmath0-models , for @xmath337 and @xmath338 in open @xmath1 models , and for @xmath339 and @xmath340 in closed @xmath1 models .",
    "these ranges of cosmological parameters have apparently covered the values of our interest .",
    "with the green - function solutions we have found , we can now analytically investigate some important aspects about the growth of cosmological matter perturbations .",
    "first we investigate the relationship between our green functions and the standard cdm transfer function , and thereby to justify the use of the standard cdm transfer function in the analytic solution ( [ gc ] ) . in the standard cdm model ,",
    "there are no subsequent perturbations , so we have @xmath341 . as discussed in equations ( [ rad - superh ] ) and ( [ mat - superh ] ) , we also know that the cdm perturbations have a growing mode @xmath342 on super - horizon scales ( @xmath79 ) for @xmath343 or @xmath344 . for the super - horizon modes in the radiation era and all modes in the matter era ,",
    "this allows us to write @xmath345 where @xmath346 is the coefficient of the growing mode in the radiation era ( @xmath347r : @xmath344 and @xmath79 ) or in the matter era ( @xmath347 m : @xmath343 ) . thus using our green - function solutions ( [ delta_i_n-2 ] ) and ( [ gc ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath59 and @xmath348 as required by the adiabatic inflationary model",
    ", we can derive the standard cdm transfer function as @xmath349    \\nonumber\\\\    & = &    \\frac{1}{4\\eta_{\\rm eq}^2 }    \\left [      a^2\\eta_{\\rm i}^2\\widetilde{t}^{\\rm c}_{30\\rm(i)}+      2a^2\\eta_{\\rm i } \\widetilde{t}^{\\rm c}_{40\\rm(i ) }    \\right]t(k )    = \\frac{2}{5}t(k)\\ , ,    \\label{transteta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath350 and equations ( [ aflat ] ) , ( [ t_limit ] ) , ( [ tc3-propto ] ) and ( [ tc4-propto ] ) , and the last expression was obtained based on the formalism ( [ gc ] ) .",
    "first , we note that the two terms involving @xmath351 and @xmath352 are equal , meaning that the two sets of initial perturbations @xmath270 $ ] and @xmath271 $ ] contribute equally to the present matter perturbations .",
    "second , the @xmath353 here is nothing but the standard cdm transfer function which we have defined earlier .",
    "third , the coefficient @xmath354 in the final result of equation ( [ transteta ] ) is well known ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and here we obtained it using our green - function solutions .",
    "this coefficient can be also obtained by first knowing from equation ( [ density - eqn3 ] ) that @xmath100 is a constant on super - horizon scales ( @xmath111 ) , and then using its definition ( [ tau00 ] ) and equation ( [ a_j ] ) to compare its expressions for @xmath347r , m. one will find @xmath355 , which implies @xmath356 for @xmath111 .",
    "thus the above derivation and result not only illustrate the relation between our green functions and the the standard cdm transfer function @xmath353 , but also justify the use of @xmath353 in our formalism ( [ gc ] ) .",
    "one important problem for structure formation with causal seeds is to investigate how the source energy was compensated into the radiation and matter background when the seeds were formed at @xmath115 . from the result ( [ tau00-propto ] ) we know that the power spectrum of the pseudo energy @xmath357 should decay as @xmath58 on super - horizon modes .",
    "as argued in equation ( [ initial - condition ] ) , we can thus take @xmath358 as part of the initial conditions provided that the scales of interest are well outside the horizon initially . for similar reasons we can take @xmath359 , where @xmath360 .",
    "in addition , from equation ( [ tau00 ] ) without baryons , we have @xmath361 since @xmath362 is required at @xmath115 , it follows that for a given @xmath363 , one can have different ways of compensating it into between @xmath108 and @xmath364 .",
    "it is thus vital to check the dependence of the resulting @xmath365 on the way we compensate @xmath363 into the background initially .",
    "consider the following two extreme cases , both satisfying @xmath366 on super - horizon scales at @xmath115 :    1 .",

    "this implies that no matter how the source @xmath363 is compensated into the background when it was formed ( i.e.  with any portions between @xmath108 and @xmath364 initially ) , it results in the same @xmath373 today on scales which were outside the horizon at @xmath115 .",
    "we note that this independence of the initial conditions was first numerically observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and here we have provided an analytic proof .      with a complete set of green functions for both initial and subsequent perturbations , we can now investigate the resulting total cdm perturbations and therefore the compensation mechanism in models with active source .",
    "having seen the independence of the resulting @xmath375 on the way the source energy is initially compensated into various background components , we can invoke equation ( [ delta1 ] ) for @xmath376 , and equation ( [ delta_s_n ] ) for @xmath377 to obtain @xmath378 .",

    "hence this expression is convenient for numerical purposes .",
    "in addition , we see that the first term in equation ( [ delta_comp2 ] ) comes simply from the initial source energy , serving with an opposite sign to account for energy conservation .",
    "this is the so - called compensation . on the other hand , the second term results from the subsequent evolution of @xmath386 , which actively creates the cdm density perturbations on sub - horizon scales ( see later ) .",
    "this term also provides a way for defects to create non - gaussianity .    alternatively , equation ( [ delta_comp3 ] ) provides a both physically and mathematically transparent way of interpreting how the perturbations are seeded by the source .",
    "first consider the integral term for a given mode @xmath128 .",
    "when the mode is well outside the horizon , i.e.  @xmath387 , @xmath388 equals @xmath353 by definition .",
    "hence the two terms inside the inner brackets reduce to @xmath389 due to source stress - energy conservation ( [ conserve - seed1 ] ) . since the power spectrum of @xmath390 falls off as @xmath58 outside the horizon ( see eq .  [ [ theta0i - propto ] ] ) , we expect the quantity inside the brackets to be negligible until the given mode approaches horizon crossing . near horizon",
    "crossing , @xmath390 is no longer small , and @xmath388 starts departing from @xmath353 ( i.e.  @xmath391 constant @xmath392 , see figure  [ fig - tk - prime ] ) , so the two terms inside the inner brackets begin to contribute to the integral .",
    "this also explains why the correction function @xmath283 in equation ( [ gc ] ) is important in affecting the compensation scale .",
    "after horizon crossing , the significance of the two terms inside the inner brackets then depends on the subhorizon behaviours of their power spectra .    as for the first term in equation ( [ delta_comp3 ] )",
    ", we see that for a superhorizon mode today , the integral in ( [ delta_comp3 ] ) is negligible as argued above so that only the first term contributes .",
    "it serves to give the opposite sign to the source energy so as to account for energy conservation on superhorizon scales today , and thus for the compensation at the present epoch @xmath152 . on the other hand ,",
    "if a given mode is well inside the horizon today , then the first term will be negligible provided that the source energy @xmath393 has a power - law fall - off inside the horizon , as it does for cosmic strings .",
    "therefore in calculating cdm perturbations on scales of our interest , which are well inside the horizon today , the first term in equation ( [ delta_comp3 ] ) is negligible , so that it will not affect our compensation argument observed from the integral .",
    "this argument can be further strengthened by deriving the pseudo - energy today . from the definition of @xmath100 ( [ tau00 - 2 ] ) and the final result of equation ( [ delta_comp3 ] ) , one obtains @xmath394    d\\hat{\\eta}\\ , .",
    "\\label{tau00_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this result , one can clearly see that for super - horizon modes , @xmath353 is unity by definition so that only the integral survives .",
    "we have also seen from an earlier argument that on super - horizon scales , the quantity inside the square brackets is nothing but the @xmath390 , which has a @xmath58 fall - off power spectrum ( see eq .",
    "[ [ theta0i - propto ] ] ) .",
    "it follows immediately from equation ( [ tau00_0 ] ) that the pseudo - energy today , @xmath395 , has a @xmath58-decay power spectrum outside the horizon .",
    "this result confirms the super - horizon behavior of @xmath100 presented in equation ( [ tau00-propto ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", although @xmath396 is approximately unity for sub - horizon modes , the usual sub - horizon power - law decay in @xmath393 ( as in the case of cosmic strings ) will still make the first term in equation ( [ tau00_0 ] ) negligible inside the horizon .",
    "thus we can see explicitly in a neat mathematical form how compensation acts on a given length - scale . from this analysis",
    "we can also see that the compensation scale is determined not only by the functions @xmath388 and @xmath353 , but also by the properties of the source near the horizon scale .",
    "once the detailed behavior of the source near the horizon scale is known , we can accurately locate the compensation scale using equation ( [ delta_comp3 ] ) or ( [ tau00_0 ] ) .",
    "we note that this result is different from the claim in ref .",
    "@xcite , where multi - fluid compensation back - reaction effects were studied to show that the compensation scale arises naturally and uniquely from an algebraic identity in the perturbation analysis . ref .",
    "@xcite also investigated the compensation scale , and found constraints on the generation of super - causal - horizon energy perturbations from a smooth initial state , under a simple physical scheme .",
    "the compensation wavenumber was found to be constrained with @xmath397 due to causality , depending on the behavior of the causal events .",
    "this result is not inconsistent with our finding above , where we further provide a quantitative way to locate the compensation scale for any given specific model .",
    "in this paper we present a formalism which can be used to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the presence of causal seeds . in this formalism",
    "we invoked the fluid approximation in the synchronous gauge to model the contents of the universe , and assumed photon - baryon tight coupling until the last - scattering epoch to account for the baryonic effects .",

    "we first demonstrated the relation between our green functions and the standard cdm transfer function ( eq .  [ [ transteta ] ] ) .",
    "second we proved that the resulting matter perturbations today is independent of the way the source was initially compensated into the background contents of the universe ( eq .  [ [ d12 ] ] ) . with our green - function solutions and the use of the pseudo - stress - energy tensor",
    ", we finally addressed the compensation mechanism in a mathematically and physically explicit way ( eqs .",
    "[ [ delta_comp2 ] ] , [ [ delta_comp3 ] ] , [ [ tau00_0 ] ] ) .",
    "in particular , the compensation scale was shown to be dependent not only on the dynamics of the universe , but also on the properties of the source near the horizon scale . once given the detailed behavior of the source near the horizon scale",
    ", the compensation scale can be accurately located using our green functions ( eq .  [ [ tau00_0 ] ] ) .",
    "although in the literature , there have been detailed treatments of theories with causal seeds , the formalism and its analytic solutions presented here will provide not only a physically transparent way for understanding the evolution of matter perturbations , but also a computationally economical scheme which is particularly pertinent when one needs to investigate the phase information of the resulting cosmological perturbations .",
    "following the same line of development , we have been also working on the analytic solutions for radiation perturbations @xcite , which will be useful in computing the full - sky cmb anisotropies seeded by topological defects .",

    "with the discovery of the cmbr in 1964 @xcite , the universe is believed to be mainly composed of not only matter but also radiation . after the discovery , several authors worked out the solutions in some frw models with both radiation and matter @xcite . in this appendix",
    ", we aim to derive the general solution of frw models , in the presence of both curvature and a cosmological constant .",
    "we assume that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , and is filled with two fluids , radiation and dark matter , whose stress - energy tensors are also homogeneous and isotropic on average .",
