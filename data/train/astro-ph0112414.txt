    "the microlensing results towards the large magellanic cloud @xcite generated much interest in the possibility of white dwarfs ( wd ) as significant contributors to the galactic halo dark matter .",
    "the most recent results suggest a most likely macho fraction of 20% and a most likely macho mass between 0.15 and 0.9 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "other macho candidates such as brown dwarfs , m dwarfs , and neutron stars are excluded , respectively , on the basis of the most likely macho mass , direct star counts which suggest that their contribution to the total mass is insignificant @xcite and entirely unacceptable nucleosynthesis yields from their main sequence precursors @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs are well - known low luminosity stars , and have been extensively surveyed , for instance by @xcite and @xcite . a very recent report @xcite suggests the scale height for thin disk white dwarfs may be higher than previously thought , and that consequently the total number of thin disk white dwarfs is also higher than previously thought .",
    "white dwarfs as dark matter pose their own set of problems , as their main sequence progenitor may produce more metals ( he , c , n ) than observed @xcite .",
    "these chemical evolution constraints can possibly be avoided by assuming a non - standard initial mass function @xcite and , perhaps , lower metal yields from z=0.0 zero age main sequence progenitors .",
    "recent results @xcite suggest that the first - dredge up does not take place for zero metallicity stars with @xmath15 .",
    "further , the second dredge - up is suppressed for zero metallicity stars with @xmath16 and only brings cno to the surface for @xmath17 . finally , thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch which would normally bring carbon to the surface may not occur @xcite .",
    "interest in wd as directly detectable dark matter intensified with the suggestion that ancient hydrogen atmosphere wd evolve towards _ bluer _ optical colors as they cool @xcite , remaining detectable in the @xmath5 band for many gyr longer than previously assumed .",
    "this provided a plausible explanation for some of the faint blue objects in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) , two of which were reported to have proper motions consistent with an interpretation as ancient halo white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "although the hdf moving objects were determined to be false detections @xcite , excitement over the possibility of halo white dwarfs was renewed with the results of @xcite who claim detection of 38 halo white dwarfs , constituting at least 2% of the galactic halo dark matter .",
    "@xcite present their results in the form of a plot of the galactic radial ( u ) and rotational ( v ) velocities of each wd and superimpose 1 and 2 sigma contours for the expected locations of the thick disk and halo components of the milky way .",
    "white dwarfs lying outside the 2 sigma contours of the thick disk are assumed to belong to a halo population .",
    "@xcite provide an alternate interpretation of the @xcite results , arguing the velocity distribution is more consistent with the high - velocity tail of the thick disk .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the placement of the halo candidates along a fiducial wd evolution track in a color - magnitude diagram , @xcite notes that the @xcite halo population seems to have an age distribution similar to the standard thin disk population . @xcite",
    "finds that it is difficult to make the age distribution of this sample consistent with common assumptions about thick disk star formation ( a simple burst at early times ) , and even more difficult to achieve consistency with some sort of truly ancient halo population .",
    "@xcite extend this argument , noting that the thick disk and halo wd populations ( as divided by @xcite ) are indistinguishable in terms of luminosity , color and apparent age .",
    "@xcite undertake a more sophisticated analysis of the @xcite sample , calculating the contribution of the thick disk and halo using a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "they find a local number density of thick disk wd of @xmath18 pc@xmath9 and a local number density of halo wd of @xmath19 pc@xmath9 .",
    "the halo density is about 5 times higher then previously expected @xcite , but constitutes only @xmath20 0.8% of the dark halo density , at least an order of magnitude smaller than the macho density implied by the microlensing results .",
    "@xcite also provide a reanalysis of the @xcite sample .",
    "these authors use a comprehensive description of galactic stellar populations to provide a simulation of the @xcite data , including the detection limits in proper motion , magnitude and color .",
    "they conclude that thick disk white dwarfs with standard local densities are sufficient to explain the @xcite sample .",
    "the wide spread in age of the @xcite sample has led several parties to suggest that these wd originated in the thin disk , but were subsequently accelerated to much higher velocities .",
    "@xcite suggest a mechanism to eject wd into the halo with the required speeds of @xmath21 km / s through the orbital instability of triple systems .",
    "@xcite proposes another binary driven mechanism in which the secondary of a tight binary system ( the wd progenitor ) is ejected at high velocity when the primary explodes as a supernova .",
    "the @xcite results are based on a very wide survey ( 10% of the sky ) with a bright limiting magnitude ( @xmath22 ) . in this work",
    "we take the opposite approach , examining a very small area of the sky ( 20 wide field planetary camera 2 fields ) , but probing to a very deep limiting magnitude ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "based on the @xcite results which are @xmath24% proper motion limited @xcite , we would not expect the white dwarf luminosity function to rise suddenly beyond their detection limit .",
    "however , the @xcite survey can not exclude the existence of an ancient `` dark halo '' white dwarf population of age @xmath25 gyr .",
    "in fact , since @xcite use the @xcite survey of young white dwarfs to derive a linear relationship between absolute magnitude and color , they assume that all detected white dwarfs are younger than the beginning of the cooling turnoff towards bluer colors in the color magnitude diagram . in their filters ,",
    "this color turnoff occurs at a temperature of around 2500 k , or a white dwarf age of about 13 - 14 gyr .",
    "since they observe very few white dwarfs near the color turnoff this is probably a good , if limiting , assumption .",
    "although we initially explore an intuitive analysis of our sample along the same lines as @xcite , in our final analysis we avoid making any assumptions about the age of our sample and estimate the local densities of disk and halo white dwarfs based solely on the observed properties of our sample : apparent magnitude , color and proper motion vector on the sky .",
    "this work is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the observation and reduction of each epoch , our procedure for matching stars between epochs , the selection of significant high proper motion objects and the results of our completeness tests . in ",
    "3 we describe our selection criteria for white dwarfs and examine their kinematic properties in a manner similar to @xcite . in  4 we model various components of the milky way and compute the number of white dwarf detections we expect in our survey .",
    "then , using only the directly observable properties , we create a method to statistically separate our sample into the various milky way components .",
    "we conclude in  5 .",
    "first epoch images of the `` groth - westphal strip '' @xcite were taken by the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in the f606w and f814w filters between march 7 , 1994 and april 8 , 1994 .",
    "this dataset consists of 27 adjacent wfpc2 fields taken at high galactic latitude ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "each first - epoch field covers 4.4 arcmin@xmath0 , consists of 4 raw exposures per filter and has a combined exposure time of 4400s in the standard hubble space telescope ( hst ) i - band ( f814w ) and 2800s in a narrow band v ( f606w ) .    a re - imaging of 17 fields of the groth strip , comprising 74.8 arcmin@xmath0 ,",
    "was taken by the wfpc2 in a single filter ( f606w ) in march , 2001 , giving us a baseline of 7 years between epochs .",
    "each second - epoch field consists of 6 raw exposures and has a combined exposure time of 4200s .      because the groth strip lies at such high galactic latitude , the fields are nearly devoid of bright stellar objects , containing @xmath28 stars of @xmath29 per wfpc2 chip .",
    "this makes it difficult to compute exact transformations between the multiple raw images of the same field , especially as the raw images are heavily contaminated by incident cosmic ray particles .",
    "thus , in combining the raw images we assume that the requested pointing offsets between raw images ( commonly called dithers ) were accurate and the images were combined using these offsets .",
    "generally , wfpc2 pointings are accurate to @xmath30 wf pixels , so this assumption does not add serious error to the procedure .",
    "the first epoch images are all taken at the same pointing ( un - dithered ) so the raw images are combined with zero offset .",
    "the second epoch images are dithered by non - integer values .",
    "we list the fields and times observed in table 1 .",
    "after the raw images were aligned , all subsequent processing and reductions were performed using the hstphot package made publicly available by andrew dolphin @xcite .",
    "each raw image is first masked using the bad pixel mask .",
    "the aligned raw images are then combined and cleaned of cosmic rays . for each pixel",
    ", the cosmic ray cleaning algorithm computes the median pixel value , a photon counting uncertainty ( @xmath31 ) based on the median value , the exposure time , read noise and gain .",
    "the uncertainty is then given an additional contribution added in quadrature to account for the registration uncertainty .",
    "pixel values which were more then @xmath32 from the median value were rejected and the remaining pixel values were averaged .",
    "point - spread fitting ( psf ) photometry was performed on the combined images using the hstphot package .",
    "the hstphot package includes a library of psfs constructed with the tiny tim software .",
    "for the f814w filter it also includes default residuals to the `` perfect '' tiny tim psfs .",
    "in addition , hstphot also allows the psf to be adjusted based on measurements made on suitable stars in the user s program frames . in the groth strip frames ,",
    "there are very few stars with enough counts to act as suitable psf stars .",
    "attempts to adjust the psf using available stars resulted in unusual looking psfs , although the final results were insensitive to the psf used ( see below ) .",
    "thus , in the final reductions we forced hstphot not to adjust its psf based on our program frames . for the f814w band reductions we allowed it to use the default residuals . according to the hstphot documentation , not adjusting the psf based on the program stars can create a systematic error of up to @xmath330.1 magnitudes for faint stars .",
    "we allowed hstphot to internally compute aperture corrections .",
    "the hstphot magnitudes were converted to landolt @xmath5 and @xmath34 using the synthetic transformations of table 10 from @xcite .",
    "hstphot also includes an object classification routine which divides objects into stars , possible unresolved binaries , single - pixel cosmic rays or extended objects .",
    "hstphot was designed for crowded stellar fields and the use of this software on fields of mostly galaxies is certainly an application beyond its intended purpose .",
    "thus , it is unsurprising that the object classification routine was often unreliable , classifying objects as stellar which , upon inspection seemed more likely to be galactic .",
    "regardless of the output classification , hstphot fits a stellar psf to all objects and the output magnitude and centroids are based on this fit .",
    "the quality of its output is thus directly related to whether or not the object was actually a point source .",
    "we estimate a total photometric error for faint objects ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath36 mag with contributions from both the non ideal psf and photon counting error .",
    "we can use the artificial star tests ( described in   [ cmp ] ) to estimate the centroid accuracy of hstphot for stellar objects by computing the difference between the input and recovered centroid .",
    "the centroid uncertainty as a function of magnitude for all artifical stars is shown in figure  [ centroid ] .",
    "this uncertainty is underestimated in the sense that it tests the ability of hstphot to centroid objects with a perfect psf .",
    "the artificial star tests add stars to frames with the same psf ( plus random noise ) with which they are recovered .",
    "since this psf is not perfect for the real stars in our frame , the centroid uncertainty for real stars is likely substantially higher . the greater uncertainty in the centroids for real stars is reflected in final uncertainty in the coordinate transformation between epochs ( see   [ match ] ) which is much larger than the hstphot centroid uncertainty of figure  [ centroid ] .",
    "accurate computation of the transformation between two epochs of a field is best performed using many , bright , point - like sources .",
    "bright stellar sources are in short supply in the groth strip and we are forced to compromise to some extent .    the first step in computing transformations between two wfpc2 frames is to correct for the geometric distortion of the chips .",
    "there are several sets of distortion coefficients available including one specifically optimized for the first epoch groth strip @xcite , but the most widely employed are from @xcite .",
    "each set of coefficients can also put the four wfpc2 chips on a single `` global '' coordinate frame .",
    "since the accuracy of our transformations is limited by the low number of sources per field , a global coordinate system would seem to be a useful tool .",
    "we experimented with transformations based on several different global coordinate systems and always found the residuals of these transformations to depend heavily on the x or y position of the star on the chip .",
    "this problem arises not from the distortion coefficients themselves but from the fact that the geometric transformation of wfpc2 has a small time dependence , primarily in the interchip separation which can vary by as much as 150 mas .",
    "thus , there exists no global distortion solutions that work well on both the first epoch ( 1994 ) and second epoch ( 2001 ) data .",
    "this limited us to computing local transformations on a chip by chip basis using the @xcite distortion coefficients .",
    "since the reduction of this data ( in april 2001 ) a new set of distortion coefficents has become available ( wfpc2 instrument science report 2001 - 10 ) .",
    "we have tested a reduction routine in which we use the @xcite distortion coefficients for our epoch 1 data and the new distortion coefficients for our epoch 2 data .",
    "we find no significant improvement in our results .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in our transformations arises from our imperfect psf and the small number of objects in our fields , not the distortion correction used .    because we were unable to use global transformations , we were also unable to use the data in the planetary camera ( pc ) .",
    "the extremely small area of the pc ( @xmath37 square arcminutes ) rarely encompassed enough objects in the frame with which to compute local transformations . for consistency , we simply ignore all pc data .    before performing the transformations",
    ", we developed an object classification routine based on the sextractor software @xcite .",
    "sextractor identifies objects above a certain threshold and then utilizes a neural network classification routine to assign each object a decimal number between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates a stellar ( point - source ) object and 1 indicates a galactic ( extended - source ) object . initially ,",
    "we computed transformations based only on objects that were classified as stellar by sextractor with the appropriate centroids taken from the hstphot output .",
    "for many chips there simply were not enough such stellar objects to compute transformations .",
    "thus , we developed a routine where transformations were computed using stellar objects and `` small , round '' galaxies .",
    "after much experimentation we found that better transformations were obtained from hstphot centroids ( psf fitting centroids ) for both stars and galaxies than from using the sextractor centroids for the galaxies .",
    "computing the coordinate transformations is an iterative procedure , in which we remove objects with residuals greater then 3 sigma before computing the final transformations .",
    "final transformations computed are a full 6 parameter fit allowing for translation , rotation and change of scale .",
    "our transformations are computed assuming that the vector sum of the proper motions over all stars and galaxies was zero .    in figures",
    "[ res_x ] and  [ res_y ] , we plot the residuals to the coordinate transformation between epochs for all groth fields , @xmath38 and @xmath39 as a function of x and y position on the chip , magnitude , and radius from the distortion center at @xmath40 .",
    "the residuals show no obvious dependence on position indicating that we have corrected for the geometric distortion of the chips .",
    "the residuals show some dependence on magnitude , increasing towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "we compute the transformations and residuals only for stars with @xmath41 although we allow fainter stars to appear in the final list of matched stars for a frame . the main reason for this",
    "is that below @xmath42 real stars in epoch 2 start to get matched with noise in epoch 1 ( epoch 2 is @xmath43 magnitude deeper ) .",
    "since the final high proper motion star lists are inspected by hand ( see below ) , it is acceptable to include ill - matched stars in the final matched lists , but it is crucial that we minimize their occurrence in the list of stars used to compute the transformations .    the transformation residuals are used to compute standard deviations in x and y , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and then we define the total standard deviation as @xmath46 . in figure  [ vec_res ]",
    "we show a vector plot of the residuals for all stars used to compute the transformations in all fields as a function of position on the wfpc2 chip .",
    "the sigma for all fields combined is @xmath47 .    our final uncertainty in the coordinate transformation ,",
    "@xmath48 is a substantially worse result then the limits reached by anderson & king ( 2000 ) .",
    "our analysis is limited in comparison to their work in several respects .",
    "first , we can not derive an effective psf as we have virtually no suitable psf stars and the first epoch was undithered . without dithering and a large sample of psf stars",
    "one can not hope to adequately sample the pixel phase space and derive an effective psf .",
    "second , we have very few point sources per frame ( a median value of 4 per chip ) with which to derive transformations .",
    "although we supplement the point source centroids with centroids of small galaxies , our ability to derive accurate transformations suffers as a result of the non point source psf of the galaxies .",
    "we note that our estimate of 4 stars per chip is in line with the previous first epoch groth strip reductions of @xcite who find an average of 3.1 m dwarfs per chip .",
    "once the transformations were computed , lists of matching objects with @xmath49 were made .",
    "objects were matched to their nearest neighbor to a maximum of @xmath50 and were considered matched only if the @xmath5 magnitude in each epoch matched to within 0.5 mag .",
    "an object was considered to have a significant movement between epochs and is hereafter known as a high proper motion object if the residual to the transformation for that object was above the maximum value of 3@xmath31 for that field or @xmath51 ( 1 pixel ) .",
    "that is , the proper motion limit is defined as @xmath52 in order to minimize confusion while matching stars between epochs , we chose an upper proper motion limit of 7.5 pixels , or @xmath53/yr .",
    "each high proper motion object was inspected by hand to verify that it was a plausible match between epochs and possessed a stellar psf .    in figure",
    "[ xy ] , we plot the vector proper motion as a function of the location on the wfpc2 chip for all high proper motion ( hpm ) objects . averaged over all chips and all fields , the expected distribution of high proper motion objects over the face of the chip should be roughly uniform .",
    "we do not see any obvious departures from non - uniformity .",
    "most importantly , we do not see any clustering of barely significant hpm objects towards the edges of the chip where the geometric distortions are most severe .",
    "we repeated the full analysis using the adjustable psf option in hstphot .",
    "while a few barely significant movers in the constant psf reduction were not significant in the adjustable psf option and vice versa , the list of hpm objects was similar .",
    "all final wd candidates discussed below appeared in both the adjustable and constant psf reductions .",
    "we performed completeness tests by adding artificial stars to the @xmath5 band images from both epochs .",
    "we compute the completeness fraction as a function of both magnitude and proper motion .",
    "first , coordinates for the star in epoch 2 were chosen randomly .",
    "we then compute the corresponding position in the epoch 1 frame using the derived transformations and apply a random offset ( proper motion ) of @xmath54 , @xmath55 pixels before adding the star to the epoch 1 frame .",
    "if the transformed position does not lie on the epoch 1 frame , the star is not added to either epoch frame .",
    "because of this , the effective area of our survey is only the area in which we have complete overlap between the two epochs .",
    "we create 25 frames each containing 20 artificial stars in each camera .",
    "the artificial frames are then run through the standard photometric analysis .",
    "we do not recompute the transformations between epochs for the artificial frames . in this sense ,",
    "the proper motion axis of the completeness test is artificial - since we add stars with the correct transformation , of course we recover them with the same transformation .",
    "our completeness fraction is thus uniform in proper motion and really depends only on the @xmath5 magnitude .",
    "the completeness fraction as a function of @xmath5 magnitude and proper motion is shown in figure  [ eff ] .",
    "since we compute our completeness fraction only in @xmath5 ( and not @xmath34 ) the calibrated magnitudes of the artificial stars are computed without a color term .",
    "we compute our completeness as a function of @xmath56 only to 4.25 pixels , yet in our analysis we accept objects in our samples with proper motions of up to 7.5 pixels .",
    "we chose the 4.25 pixels to be large enough to include the range of all observed high proper motion objects , yet small enough to allow good coverage in @xmath56 in a reasonable amount of computation time .",
    "as discussed above , our efficiencies do not depend on @xmath56 and we expect no dependence to arise if our efficiency calculation were extended to 7.5 pixels .    we expect that the detection efficiency should fall to exactly zero at @xmath57 as we do not allow stars with @xmath58 to appear in the final list of matched stars .",
    "the detection efficiency is not quite zero in this plot because we calculate the efficiency as a function of @xmath59 and we recover a very small fraction of stars that have @xmath60 but are recovered at @xmath61 and thus appear in the final matched lists .",
    "our completeness fraction falls rapidly to zero at @xmath1 , suggesting a limiting magnitude @xmath62 .",
    "after an initial period of nearly blackbody cooling towards longer wavelengths , ancient white dwarfs experience a color turnoff and start to cool towards bluer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "an example cooling curve of a 0.6 @xmath14 wd is shown in figure  [ track ] .",
    "thus , we expect to detect halo white dwarfs as blue objects with high proper motions .",
    "one way to isolate such candidates is on the basis of a reduced proper motion versus color diagram .    in figure",
    "[ rpm ] we show the reduced proper motion diagram for all the significantly moving ( high proper motion ) objects in the groth strip .",
    "the reduced proper motion is defined as @xmath63 . for an ensemble of objects with similar transverse velocities , @xmath64 , an @xmath65 versus",
    "color diagram is an estimate of the color - absolute magnitude diagram where the magnitude axis has been shifted by some arbitrary constant . in figure  ( [ rpm ] )",
    "we show the groth strip hpm objects as large triangles and squares .    on the left hand side of figure  [ rpm ]",
    "we show a random sample of detectable white dwarfs from the thin disk ( blue dots ) , thick disk ( red dots ) , stellar halo ( green dots ) and dark halo ( black dots ) .",
    "the parameters determining the geometry and stellar content of each galactic components and our method for determining detectability will be discussed further in   [ simulations ] .",
    "we note that the five hpm objects marked as filled black triangles fall over plausibly dense regions of the simulated white dwarf dots .    on the right hand side of figure  [ rpm ]",
    "we show a random sample of detectable low mass main sequence stars @xmath66 from the thin disk ( blue crosses ) , thick disk ( red crosses ) and stellar halo ( black crosses ) .",
    "the parameters of the galactic components are the same as for the wds and we use the low mass main sequence tracks from @xcite",
    ". the hpm objects shown as filled black squares fall on plausibly dense regions of the simulated low mass main sequence star crosses .",
    "if we had included higher mass main sequence stars , the density of points would fall off much slower at small @xmath65 .    on the basis of this",
    "reduced proper motion diagram we identify the filled black triangles as strong white dwarf candidates and the filled black triangles as main sequence stars .",
    "the @xmath5 magnitude , @xmath6 color and proper motion , @xmath56 , of the white dwarf candidates are shown in table 2 .",
    "the two stars shown as open triangles have @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , and fall in an unpopulated region of the reduced proper motion diagram .",
    "since we calculate the 3@xmath31 significant proper motion limit @xmath70 with stars of @xmath29 and the proper motions of these faint stars are only barely above the proper motion limit , it may be the case that these two stars are not hpm objects at all , but simply spurious detections at very faint magnitude .",
    "however , it may also be the case that these two stars are moving objects , and are in fact white dwarfs near the color - turnoff .",
    "to move these two objects into the white dwarf region of the reduced proper motion diagram would require an error of @xmath71 magnitudes in @xmath6 in either our photometry or the theoretical white dwarf cooling tracks . since an error of this magnitude is plausible , we will later consider the possibility that these two objects may belong to our white dwarf sample .",
    "we include these two objects in table 2 as marginal candidates",
    ".    as noted by @xcite , quasars ( qsos ) can be an important contaminant of the white dwarf region of the reduced proper motion diagram .",
    "@xcite investigate this issue in detail and conclude that the soundest way to to eliminate qsos from a white dwarf sample is to choose only objects which move with some certain minimum proper motion .",
    "they suggest that qsos are almost certainly detected at proper motion of less than four times the uncertainty ( eg .",
    "@xmath72 ) and that objects with proper motions above this limit are more certainly wd .",
    "the condition @xmath73 is satisfied for all of our candidates ( see table 2 ) .    hereafter we shall refer to wd candidates 1 - 5 from table 2 as our 5 wd sample . since we have the most confidence in this sample we will devote most discussion to it . we will also discuss the possibility that the marginal candidates do belong to our wd sample and will refer to wd candidates 1 - 7 from table 2 as our 7 wd sample . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will also discuss the possibility that all of our faint candidates are in error and that only wd 1 , 3 and 4 from table 2 belong to our wd sample .",
    "this will be referred to as the 3 wd sample .",
    "we emphasize that these are not spectrally confirmed wd . with the exception of the bright candidate at @xmath74",
    "these objects are too faint to allow for spectral confirmation with present technology .",
    "we also note that the proper motion of these candidates has not been confirmed with a third epoch .",
    "a previous wfpc2 detection of high proper motion wd by @xcite has recently been withdrawn after a third epoch revealed the reported proper motion to be a spurious measurement @xcite .",
    "we note that all our candidates have substantially higher counts in both epochs than the second epoch image of @xcite .      in order to determine the transverse velocity of each candidate",
    ", we must first determine its distance , or , equivalently , its absolute magnitude . in principle , this may be done by finding the intersection of the color of each candidate with an absolute magnitude versus color track , such as that shown in figure  [ track ] .",
    "however , because of the color turnoff , the @xmath6 color does not uniquely determine @xmath75 .",
    "instead , for each candidate we have a `` young '' and an `` old '' solution as illustrated in figure  [ track ] .",
    "for each solution we may calculate the distance , @xmath76 and the transverse velocity , @xmath77 , where @xmath56 is the proper motion .",
    "both the young and old solutions for the wd cooling time , distance , and transverse velocity are shown in table 2 .",
    "we include error bars on the derived quantities ( cooling time , distance , transverse velocity and absolute magnitude ) by calculating the maximum and minimum values obtained while i adjusting the @xmath5 magnitude and @xmath6 color by one unit of error ( 0.15 mag for @xmath5 and 0.20 mag for @xmath6 ) .",
    "we note that the cooling time is not the total age of the wd as it does not include the main sequence lifetime of the wd precursors .    in a simplistic sense ,",
    "the marginal candidates have no solution for the derived parameters since they do not intersect a white dwarf track in @xmath6 color .",
    "we assume that it is plausible that the observed @xmath6 color is wrong by some small amount and that they may just barely intersect the reddest point of the theoretical white dwarf track . since we assume they only barely intersect the tip of the color turnoff , they cross the white dwarf track at only one point and have only one solution .    also , we note that even if all the `` old '' solutions are correct , most of our wd are located at least one thin disk scaleheight ( 300 pc ) above the plane .",
    "we also include the proper motion in the direction of increasing galactic longitude , @xmath78 , and latitude , @xmath79 in table 2 .",
    "the spherical coordinate system employed implies that @xmath80 .",
    "this two solution ambiguity is not present in brighter , ground based samples where the distance can be determined with a photometric distance relation .",
    "such a relation is essentially a linear fit to the young branch of a wd track in a color - absolute magnitude diagram .",
    "one such relation is derived in @xcite using the @xcite sample of nearby white dwarfs for which parallax distances are available .",
    "the @xcite sample employs this relation without much fear of ambiguity because in their filters ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) the color turnoff does not occur until a cooling time of @xmath2013.5 gyr .",
    "in contrast , in our filters , the color turnoff occurs at the relatively short cooling time of @xmath2010 gyr .    in @xcite ,",

    "for instance , as the thin disk is the most severely proper motion limited , thin disk wds are detected at a mean distance much closer to the observer and thus at a much brighter apparent magnitude .",

    "( we note that using the thin disk scale height of @xcite increases the expected number of thin disk detections to 1.9 .",
    "this is discussed further in   [ alternate_disk ] . )    clearly , our observed sample of 5 white dwarfs is a significant deviation from an expected number of @xmath2012 .",
    "however , the source of the excess of white dwarfs is an open question .",
    "perhaps the simplest explanation is that our estimate of the local white dwarf densities @xmath87 are too small for one or more of the known stellar components .",
    "another possibility is that the excess of white dwarfs arises from a fourth component : a dark halo made of ancient white dwarfs .",
    "below , we discuss what we would expect to detect from such a white dwarf component .      using the same procedure as for the known stellar populations",
    ", we estimate the number of wd detections we expect if some fraction , @xmath152 , of the milky way dark matter halo is made up of white dwarfs .",
    "this discussion is motivated by recent microlensing results which suggest that 8%50% of the dark halo is made up of machos with a most likely macho mass between 0.15 and 0.9 @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "we use the same velocity dispersions and asymmetric drift as for the stellar halo .",
    "if a substantial portion of the milky way dark halo is composed of wd , the initial mass function of this population must be rather sharply peaked in order to avoid chemical evolution constraints .",
    "the most plausible initial mass function is peaked at around 2 @xmath14 @xcite . as an example",
    ", we construct a dark halo luminosity function with a uniform star formation rate between 13.0 and 14.0 gyr with the imf1 of @xcite ( hereafter referred to as 96imf1 ) .",
    "this imf is of the form @xmath155 where @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 and peaks around @xmath159 .",
    "we estimate main sequence lifetimes from @xmath160 stars from @xcite and assume stars instantly become wd on leaving the main sequence .",
    "this choice of dark halo luminosity function is also shown in figure  [ lf ] .",
    "the geometry , age distribution and 96imf1 initial mass function described above will hereafter be referred to as our reference model for the dark halo .",
    "the number of expected detections from the dark halo scales as @xmath161 where @xmath162 , and @xmath152 indicates the fraction of the total halo dark matter made up of white dwarfs .",
    "we assume a local dark halo mass density @xmath163 , a mean white dwarf mass of 0.5 @xmath14 and scale our answer to a white dwarf halo fraction of 10% ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "the number of expected dark halo white dwarfs is relatively insensitive to the age of the dark halo in the range 12 - 14 gyr .",
    "however , @xmath165 depends critically on the choice of imf .",
    "the imf described above has the lowest mean initial mass of all the chabrier imfs , implying that stars remain on the main sequence longer , and have spent less time cooling as white dwarfs thus giving us the brightest possible dark halo luminosity function .",
    "using imf2 from @xcite ( hereafter 96imf2 ) which has a slightly higher mean main sequence mass results in a slightly fainter white dwarf luminosity function and decreases the expected number of dark halo white dwarf detections to @xmath166 for a 10% wd halo ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "taken at face value , if we accept the local white dwarf densities from known stellar populations derived in ",
    "[ known ] then the total number of wd candidates , @xmath168 implies @xmath169 , which by equation  ( [ darkscale ] ) implies a dark halo wd fraction @xmath170 , in line with the microlensing results of @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is misleading because our knowledge of the local white dwarf densities and various other model parameters is imperfect .",
    "it is not clear whether the excess white dwarfs in our sample arise from an excess of white dwarfs from known stellar populations or whether we must invoke the presence of a fourth dark component to explain our results .    in order to address this question ,",
    "we must use more information about our sample than simply the total number of observed white dwarfs .",
    "ideally , we would approach the separation of our sample into various components with a purely kinematic approach as in @xcite , removing the most uncertain aspect of our models ( age and initial mass functions of each component ) from the calculation all together .",
    "however , the white dwarfs in our sample are , with one exception , too faint to allow for spectroscopic velocity measurements .",
    "they are also potentially too old to allow for a photometric distance calculation as in @xcite and too distant for parallax measurements .",
    "conversely , samples which are bright enough to allow for distance determinations are not able to exclude the presence of a truly ancient wd dark halo ( see e.g.  10 of @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of an ancient wd halo must be confirmed or denied with a sample in which space velocities can not be measured , only proper motions .",
    "proper motions alone will not currently allow any reasonable division of our sample into four separate components . in order to accomplish this we must use all the available information for each white dwarf : @xmath171 . using the component models described above , we may form four dimensional distribution functions in these variables and compare the shape of these distributions with our observed sample .",
    "the comparison takes the form of a maximum likelihood analysis in which we determine what linear combination of distributions from each component best fits our observed sample . by introducing the luminosity and color information into the analysis instead of focusing solely on kinematics",
    ", our results will depend somewhat on our assumptions about the luminosity functions ( especially for division between the stellar and dark halo ) .",
    "since improved future knowledge about the age and initial mass functions of each component and a larger sample size may reduce this sensitivity , we proceed with a brief investigation of one possible method for separation of a white dwarf sample into various components using only the photometric and astrometric information available for faint objects .    in figure",
    "[ wd_distrib ] , we show the one dimensional projections of the distribution functions @xmath172 for detectable wd in our simulations from the thin disk ( blue ) , thick disk ( red ) , stellar halo ( black ) and dark halo ( green ) .",
    "the parameters for each galactic component are those of our reference model described in   [ known ] and   [ dark ] .",
    "we also show the distribution of the observed 5 wd sample as a dashed black histogram .",
    "all curves have been normalized such that the total area under the curve is unity .",
    "the proper motion vector has been divided into two components , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , the proper motion in the direction of increasing galactic latitude and longitude , respectively .",
    "the curves in figure  [ wd_distrib ] are the one dimensional projection of a four dimensional cube , @xmath175 , in which each element of the cube , @xmath176 , holds the probability that a wd from each component @xmath142 will be detected within some small volume element centered about @xmath171 .",
    "the cube is normalized such that the sum over all cells is unity , @xmath177 if the number of wd drawn from a given component is @xmath178 , then the occupation number of cell @xmath176 is @xmath179 if we sum the four dimensional cubes over all components , @xmath142 , multiplied by the appropriate coefficient , @xmath180 , we create the distribution function of white dwarfs for the entire galaxy .",
    "the occupation number of a cell in this cube is thus @xmath181    we assume that the cell size is small enough that @xmath182 and that in a given sample of observed wd , a cell will contain at most one white dwarf .",
    "a sample of observed wd then defines two sets of cells : the set f whose cells are filled with the observed wd , and the set e whose cells are empty . given a defined set f of observed wd , the likelihood of a configuration with a given set of coefficients @xmath183 is @xmath184 \\left [ \\sum_{i \\in e } ( 1.0 - \\lambda_{i } ) \\right ] ~.\\ ] ] maximizing over the four dimensional space , we find that the maximum likelihood occurs at ( @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath165)@xmath188 @xmath189 .    in figure  ( [ two_component ] ) , we show a two dimensional projection of the likelihood space where we sum over the thin and thick disk to form a `` disk '' component , and sum over the stellar and dark halo to form a `` halo '' component .",

    "given this model of the dark halo using the 96imf1 dark halo luminosity function , our results imply the presence of a @xmath212% white dwarf dark halo ( with substantial statistical error bars ) and an excess of thin disk white dwarfs .",

    "however , the statistical error bars on the thin disk contribution are quite large - even with the error bars projected into one dimension , we are still less then 2.5@xmath31 from the canonical value .",

    "[ known ] and   [ dark ] one possible model for our galaxy .",

    "we explore alternative and equally credible models of the galaxy . although the modifications we explore below do change our results somewhat , our solution always returns roughly @xmath214 disk wd and @xmath215 halo wd .",
    "minor modifications to our models and procedure shift the disk wd around between the thin and thick disk and the halo wd between the stellar and dark halo .    in the following examples",

    "we find that the division of our sample between the thin and thick disks is insensitive to the age distributions of the disk components and depends mainly on the kinematics .    in   [ division ]",
    "we describe the results of our maximum likelihood analysis using our reference model which has a thin disk of age 011 gyr and a thick disk of age 1112 gyr , modelling the thick disk as an old population formed in a single burst . at the opposite extreme",

    "conversely , despite the great difference in absolute magnitude luminosity function between the 011 gyr thick disk in figure  [ thick_young_lf ] and the 1112 gyr thick disk in figure  [ lf ] , the apparent magnitude luminosity functions of the thick disks in figures  [ wd_distrib ] and  [ thick_young_distrib ] are very similar .",
    "the apparent magnitude luminosity functions of the 011 gyr and 1112 gyr thick disks remain similar because the apparent magnitude luminosity functions are more sensitive to the kinematics than to the input absolute magnitude functions .",
    "the thin disk has smaller velocity dispersions and is , therefore , more severely proper motion limited than the thick .",

    "we also explore the possibility that our model for the thin disk is in error .",
    "recent results by @xcite suggest that the canonical thin disk scale height is too small .",
    "they suggest a scale height of 400 - 600 pc for old thin disk populations . if their assertion is correct , the effect on our simulations is substantial as the great majority of our wd candidates are detected at least one scale scaleheight above the plane .",
    "this effect would be evident in our sample as an overabundance of thin disk white dwarfs compared to what we expect to see with a thin disk with a scaleheight of 300 pc .",
    "we model the @xcite thin disk as a disk with scaleheight 500 pc , @xmath221 larger then the canonical value . to maintain consistency with the boltzman equations , we scale the thin disk velocity dispersions by the same factor of @xmath221 @xcite .",
    "this model gives an expected number of thin disk white dwarf detections @xmath222 and the maximum likelihood analysis gives @xmath223 pc@xmath9 , @xmath218 pc@xmath9 , @xmath219 pc@xmath9 , and @xmath220 pc@xmath9 with the other components modelled as in our reference model . assuming a statistical error bar of @xmath216% , the @xcite thick disk scale height lowers our local thin disk density to within @xmath224 sigma of the canonical value .",
    "since the stellar halo and dark halo in our models have similar density profiles and identical kinematics , the separation of the halo signal into the stellar halo and dark halo depends entirely on our assumptions about their stellar content . in  [ division ] we assumed a stellar halo of age 1112 gyr with a saltpeter initial mass function and a dark halo of age 1314 gyr with the 96imf1 initial mass function .",
    "this led to a result suggesting a @xmath212% white dwarf dark halo .",
    "however , this result depends entirely on our choice of initial mass function for the dark halo .",
    "any assumption which makes the dark halo luminosity function any fainter will shift the halo signal from the dark halo to the stellar halo . for instance , a switch to the 96imf2 initial mass function gives a most likely answer of @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 , or @xmath217",

    "[ selection ] there is some possibility that our wd sample should include the two marginal candidates wd6 and wd7 , giving us a 7 wd sample . taking the opposite approach we might conclude that all our faint candidates should be excluded and include only wd1 , wd3 and wd4 , giving a 3 wd sample .    in figure  [ 3wd ] we compare the 3 wd sample to the one dimensional distribution functions of our reference model using the 96imf1 dark halo luminosity function .",
    "this sample gives @xmath241 , @xmath242 @xmath187 , @xmath243 @xmath244 for a thin disk density @xmath8 pc@xmath9 .    in figure  [ 7wd ]",
    "we compare the 7 wd sample to the one dimensional distribution functions .",
    "this sample gives @xmath245 .",
    "the thin disk contribution is lower for the larger sample because the outlier at @xmath74 is less significant .",
    "that is , in one dimension , this outlier accounts for only 14% of the area under the observed wd @xmath5 magnitude histogram instead of 20% or 33% .",
    "the maximum likelihood analysis can put less `` power '' in the thin disk and still fit this outlier . the extra power in this analysis falls entirely into the thick disk .",
    "the 7 wd sample gives densities of @xmath246 pc@xmath9 , @xmath247 pc@xmath9 , @xmath219 pc@xmath9 , @xmath248 pc@xmath9 , or a 6% wd halo .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrate that the @xcite results do not necessarily imply the presence of a substantial white dwarf dark matter halo .",
    "they also note that due to the color turnoff of ancient white dwarfs a survey with such a bright limiting magnitude can not exclude the presence of an ancient white dwarf halo of age @xmath249 gyr . to exclude an ancient halo requires a survey with a substantially fainter limiting magnitude , such as this one .    for faint or ancient white dwarfs , spectroscopic velocities",
    "are not available , parallax measurements can not be made and photometric distance relations calibrated at bright magnitudes are potentially unreliable",
    ". therefore , the division of a faint white dwarf sample into disk and halo contributions must be done without true kinematic ( velocity ) information .    in this work ,",
    "we have explored such a statistical separation using only the directly observable quantities of the five high proper motion white dwarf candidates detected in a second wfpc2 epoch of the groth - westphal strip . the small sample size and our imperfect knowledge of the characteristics of the putative white dwarf dark halo lead to possible large systematic errors in our analysis . using the 96imf1 dark halo",
    "gives a 7% white dwarf halo and @xmath250 pc@xmath251 , a gross excess of thin disk white dwarfs .",
    "however , we explore several alternative galactic models which demonstrate that uncertainties in our models lead to possible systematic errors which may be larger then the quoted statistical errors .",
    "for instance , the thin disk local density can be lowered four - fold and brought to within @xmath252 sigma of the canonical value by assuming the larger thin disk scale height suggested by @xcite .",
    "also , if we assume a slightly different dark halo initial mass function , the halo signal shifts to the stellar halo where it implies a local stellar halo white dwarf density of @xmath253 , about 10 times higher then the canonical value and similar to the results reported by @xcite .",
    "the use of external constraints also affects our results . if we constrain the thin disk contribution to the canonical value , or attempt to remove the thin disk contribution by hand ( as in @xcite ) , the disk signal shifts into the thick disk , giving @xmath254 pc@xmath9 .",
    "this elevated thick disk density is similar to the results of @xcite .",
    "however , regardless of the details of our models , we always find @xmath255 disk white dwarfs and @xmath256 halo white dwarfs , a clear excess above the @xmath2012 total detections expected from known stellar populations .",
    "we are unable to definitely determine the source of the excess signal , but its existence seems clear .",
    "we summarize the local densities found in our various calculations in table 3 .",
    "we note that the ages , abundances and kinematics of the known stellar populations of our galaxy are still a source of lively debate .",
    "we have attempted to highlight how our results depend on our assumptions about these quantities in  4.4 .",
    "attempts to more precisely determine the properties of the various components of our galaxy will benefit from surveys with very precise astrometry .",
    "both our results and those of @xcite are intriguing and together explore the two extremes of survey philosophies : bright limiting magnitude with many objects and faint limiting magnitude with few objects . the @xcite sample is bright enough to be able to employ photometric distance calibrations , however , fainter surveys necessary to truly exclude or confirm the dark white dwarf halo must employ an approach more similar to ours .",
    "future improved knowledge of the input model characteristics and a faint sample with more objects may reduce the model dependencies which hamper our conclusions .",
    "we thank andrew dolphin for many helpful discussions on adapting hstphot to our specific needs and brad hansen for discussion of white dwarf models and luminosity functions .",
