    "this task is non - trivial on two counts : first , the solution of is singular in general , see @xcite ; second , it is known since the pioneering work of @xcite that @xmath6-conforming approximation techniques that rely on uniform @xmath7-stability estimates both on the curl and the divergence of the approximate field do not converge properly if @xmath1 is non - smooth and non - convex .",

    "this is probably one reason why edge elements have been favored over @xmath0-lagrange finite elements over the years .",

    "the key idea developed in the above references is that the divergence of the discrete field approximating @xmath10 must be controlled in a space that is intermediate between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this program is carried out in @xcite by controlling the divergence of @xmath10 in a weighted @xmath7-space where the weight is a distance to the re - entrant corners of the domain to some appropriate power depending on the strength of the singularity .",
    "the analysis of the method by @xcite requires the approximation space to contain the gradient of @xmath13 scalar - valued functions , which excludes low - order finite - elements spaces .",
    "this restriction on low - order elements is removed in @xcite by considering a mixed form of the weighted @xmath7-stabilization technique on special meshes .",
    "the method developed by @xcite and @xcite involves a least - square approximation of a discrete problem with different test and trial spaces .",
    "the trial space is @xmath14 and the components of the test space are subspaces of @xmath15 .",
    "the numerical method uses piecewise constant functions for the trial space and piecewise linear functions enriched with face bubbles for the test space .",
    "a technique based on a local @xmath7-stabilization of the divergence of @xmath10 and using finite elements of order high enough so as to contain the gradient of argyris or hsieh - clough - tocher @xmath13-finite elements is introduced in @xcite .",

    "the present paper is the second part of a research program started in @xcite and is part of the phd thesis of @xcite .",
    "the technique adopted in @xcite consists of stabilizing the divergence of the field @xmath10 in a negative sobolev norm through a mixed formulation .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that stabilizing the divergence in @xmath12 is sufficient to solve the boundary value problem , but it may not be sufficient in general to solve the associated eigenvalue problem if only lipschitz regularity of the domain is assumed . in this case the divergence must be stabilized in @xmath19 with @xmath20 $ ] where @xmath21 is the polynomial degree of the approximation of @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",

    "one purpose of the present paper is to show that these difficulties can be handled properly when using continuous finite elements ; the analysis with discontinuous elements has already been done , see @xcite .",
    "the approximation that we propose consists of using a mixed formulation with nodal finite elements and an interior penalty method to account for the jumps in the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the convergence analysis presented holds for any polynomial degree ( greater than one ) . one essential argument of this paper is the construction of a smoothing operator in @xmath29 that commutes ( almost ) with the curl operator , see lemma  [ lem : commute_k ] . in passing we",
    "correct a mistake from @xcite where the smoothing operator was not constructed properly .",
    "the second important argument is lemma  [ l : cont_ip ] in the appendix .",
    "this is a variant of lemma  8.2 in @xcite ; however , our proof slightly differs from that in @xcite since the estimates therein do not seem to be uniform in the meshsize .    the method presented in this paper has been implemented in a three - dimensional parallel mhd code , sfemans , see @xcite .",
