    "the tropical approach to enumerative geometry , initiated by mikhalkin s correspondence theorem @xcite , has led to remarkable success in the study of gromov - witten and welschinger ( open gromov - witten ) invariants of toric varieties ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "mikhalkin originally used tropical methods to count curves in toric surfaces satisfying point conditions . nowadays",
    "the tropical techniques are developed for enumeration of curves satisfying tangency conditions in addition @xcite , for covers satisfying ramification conditions @xcite and for curves in higher dimensional varieties satisfying point conditions @xcite .",
    "little is known about the enumerative geometry of surfaces in toric three - folds and the tropical counterparts . with this paper , we contribute a first step towards the establishment of tropical methods in such higher - dimensional enumerative problems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend the tropical technique to the case of surfaces , having in mind the test problem of enumeration of surfaces belonging to a given divisor class in a given projective toric threefold , having a singularity in the big torus , and passing through an appropriate number of generic points . even in this seemingly simple problem",
    ", the tropical enumerative geometry appears to be non - trivial in each step .    more concretely , with start with three - dimensional version of the lattice path algorithm , which enumerates singular tropical surfaces with a given newton polytope that pass through a collection of points arranged on a generic line in a special way ( cf .",
    "contrary to the planar curve case , the corresponding lattice paths can be disconnected ( we call it  lattice path with a gap \" ) , and the problem of inscribing one of the five possible circuits ( see @xcite ) into the given lattice path turns to be a non - trivial combinatorial task , which results both in local ( i.e. , related to the circuit ) and global ( i.e. , related to the whole lattice path ) restrictions",
    ". notice also that if the line of point constraints is sufficiently close to one of the coordinate axes , in the planar curve case , the lattice path algorithm converges to a caporaso - harris algorithm @xcite which counts tropical curves with relatively simple circuits represented by unit parallelograms and multiple edges , and this leads to a much simpler floor - diagram algorithm @xcite . in its turn ,",
    "a similar enumeration of singular tropical surfaces necessarily involves surfaces with circuits represented by unit parallelograms and double edges as well as by pentatopes , which are much more involved ( for example , their classification up to @xmath5-equivalence is infinite , see @xcite ) .",
    "the next step is a correspondence statement , which to a given configuration of points in the big torus of the given toric three - fold and a singular tropical surface passing through the tropicalized point configuration associates all possible singular algebraic surfaces which contain the original point configuration and tropicalize to the given singular tropical surface .",
    "an important intermediate step in the correspondence is the finding of possible locations of tropical singular points , which can be done in several ways , contrary to the planar curve case ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    as result",
    ", we derive a formula for the number of singular surfaces in a given divisor class on a toric three - fold that pass through a generic configuration of points in the big torus , or , in other words , we compute the degree of the discriminant , namely , our formula runs over all singular tropical surfaces appearing in the lattice path algorithm and counts them with specific multiplicities .",
    "there are even simpler formulas for the degree of the discriminant ( see , for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.5 ) ) .",
    "however , an advantage of the tropical count is that it respects the real structure , and thus , one can count real objects . to demonstrate this in our situation",
    ", we address the following    * question : * _ how many real singular surfaces can occur in a generic real pencil of surfaces of degree @xmath1 in @xmath2 ? _    we show ( theorem [ t - real ] in section [ sec - examples ] ) that there exist generic pencils of surfaces of degree @xmath1 containing at least @xmath3 real singular surfaces , which is comparable with the total number @xmath4 of ( complex ) singular surfaces in a pencil .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we collect preliminaries , introduce notation and state the problem . in section [ sec - lp ] , we present a lattice path algorithm enumerating all singular tropical surfaces with any given newton polytope . in section [ sec - mt ] ,",
    "we derive a correspondence theorem and compute multiplicities for each case that can appear , i.e.  the number of singular algebraic surfaces tropicalizing to a given tropical singular surface . in section 5 , we apply our algorithm to count real singular surfaces in real pencils .",
