    "gluonic degrees of freedom play an important role in the physics of the flavour - singlet @xmath8 channel @xcite through the qcd axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "the most famous example is the @xmath2 problem : the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are much greater than the values they would have if these mesons were pure goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "this extra mass is induced by non - perturbative gluon dynamics @xcite and the axial anomaly @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of gluons in axial u(1 ) dynamics on @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction close to threshold .",
    "the @xmath0 photoproduction process has been extensively studied at mami @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the low - energy @xmath4 reaction is the prominant role of the s - wave resonance n@xmath9(1535 ) .",
    "the @xmath10 reaction is presently being studied at elsa @xcite and jefferson laboratory @xcite .",
    "the first , and trivial , observation is that the thresholds themselves are sensitive to ozi violation through the gluonic component to the meson masses .",
    "more challenging is to understand the role of the axial anomaly and non - pertubative glue in the structure of the n@xmath9(1535 ) resonance which couples strongly to the @xmath0 , and the shape of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction cross - sections with increasing energy .",
    "our aim here is to study the sensitivity of the s - wave cross - sections to the gluonic ozi parameters in the @xmath11(1)-extended effective chiral lagrangian @xcite for low - energy qcd .",
    "we illustrate the importance of @xmath2 dynamics to these processes .",
    "the role of gluonic degrees of freedom and ozi violation in the @xmath1nucleon system has previously been investigated through the flavour - singlet goldberger - treiman relation @xcite and the low - energy @xmath3 reaction @xcite .",
    "we frame our photoproduction discussion in the context this previous work .",
    "the flavour - singlet goldberger - treiman relation connects the flavour - singlet axial - charge @xmath12 measured in polarised deep inelastic scattering with the @xmath1nucleon coupling constant @xmath13 . working in the chiral limit it reads @xmath14 where @xmath13 is the @xmath1nucleon coupling constant and @xmath15 is an ozi violating coupling which measures the one particle irreducible coupling of the topological charge density @xmath16 to the nucleon . in eq.(1 ) @xmath17 is the nucleon mass and @xmath18 ( @xmath19gev ) renormalises @xcite the flavour - singlet decay constant .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath15 is , in part , related @xcite to the amount of spin carried by polarised gluons in a polarised proton .",
    "the large mass of the @xmath1 and the small value of @xmath12 @xmath20 extracted from deep inelastic scattering @xcite ( about a @xmath21 ozi suppression ) point to substantial violations of the ozi rule in the flavour - singlet @xmath22 channel .",
    "a large positive @xmath23 is one possible explanation of the small value of @xmath24 .",
    "working with the @xmath2extended chiral lagrangian for low - energy qcd one finds a gluon - induced contact interaction in the @xmath3 reaction close to threshold @xcite : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the gluonic contribution to the mass of the singlet 0@xmath27 boson and @xmath28 is a second ozi violating coupling which also features in @xmath29 scattering .",
    "the physical interpretation of the contact term ( 3 ) is a `` short distance '' ( @xmath30fm ) interaction where glue is excited in the interaction region of the proton - proton collision and then evolves to become an @xmath1 in the final state .",
    "this gluonic contribution to the cross - section for @xmath3 is extra to the contributions associated with meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "there is no reason , a priori , to expect it to be small . following the earlier work at saturne @xcite",
    "there is presently a vigorous experimental programme to investigate @xmath0 and @xmath1 production near threshold in @xmath31 collisions at celsius @xcite and cosy @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies of @xmath12 and the @xmath1nucleon system may offer new insight into the role of gluons in chiral dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the s - wave contribution to @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction .",
    "the theoretical tools are the meson - baryon `` potentials '' derived from the low - energy @xmath32 chiral effective lagrangian together with the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "we extend the coupled channels analysis of kaiser , waas and weise @xcite to include @xmath0@xmath1 mixing plus the coupling of axial @xmath2 degrees of freedom to the nucleon .",
    "the su(3 ) coupled channels approach has been shown @xcite to dynamically generate s - wave nucleon resonance contributions to low - energy hadron scattering as quasi - bound meson - baryon states .",
    "we find that a positive value of the gluonic coupling @xmath28 in eq.(3 ) generates an attractive contribution to the @xmath0nucleon and @xmath1nucleon potentials in the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "it may , in part , contribute to the sharp rise in the @xmath0 photoproduction cross - section very close to threshold .",
    "the @xmath10 cross - section rises with increasing positive @xmath28 and is suppressed for negative @xmath28 .",
    "our calculations suggest that in the gedanken world where ozi is preserved the @xmath33 contribution to @xmath34 would split into two resonance - like structures as we reduce the gluonic contribution to the @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) mass .",
    "the heavier structure is associated with a @xmath35 quasi - bound state ; the second , close to threshold , involves strong coupling to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 channels through the @xmath38 potential .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the coupled channels calculation . in section 3",
    "we briefly review the low - energy effective lagrangian for @xmath0nucleon and @xmath1nucleon interactions with emphasis on the sources of possible ozi violation . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical results .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we make our conclusions .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation for the t - matrix connecting in- and out- going channels @xmath39 and @xmath40 is @xmath41 this is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "we sum over two - particle intermediate states labelled by an index @xmath42 which runs from 1 to 7 and refers to @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the relative coupling strengths ( up to a factor @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the pion decay constant ) .",
