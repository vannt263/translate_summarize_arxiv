    "the heavy ion collision experiments provide a good possibility for a study of the baryon-(anti)baryon strong interactions using the final state interaction ( fsi ) correlation technique @xcite .",
    "it is based on the analysis of the momentum correlations caused by final state interactions between corresponding baryons produced in the collision .",
    "this activity is especially interesting in view of the ongoing nuclear collision experiments at the lhc , which produce great numbers of various particles , including exotic multi - strange , charmed and beauty ones .",
    "it allows one to study the fundamental interactions between specific hadron species , which can hardly be achieved by other means .",
    "the extraction of this information makes it possible to check the correctness of hadron - hadron strong interaction models , constrain corresponding interaction potentials , and also improve existing cascade models ( like urqmd ) by including into them the information about still unknown baryon - antibaryon annihilation cross - sections .    in the paper @xcite the experimental @xmath4 and @xmath5 correlation functions measured by star at rhic",
    "were fitted with lednick and lyuboshitz analytical model @xcite allowing , in principle , to extract scattering lengths characterizing the two - particle strong interaction . however , apart from the interaction characteristics , the correlation function depends also on the source spatial structure , described in terms of function @xmath6 , representing the time - integrated separation distribution of particle emission points in the pair rest frame .",
    "this fact complicates the study of the particle interaction , as it increases the number of free parameters which enter the fit formula .    to simplify this study",
    ", one could calculate the corresponding source functions in realistic models of the collision process , which are known to describe well the experimental observables .",
    "the hydrokinetic model @xcite provides successful simultaneous description of a wide class of bulk observables in the heavy ion collision experiments at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "moreover , it reproduces well @xcite the pion and kaon source functions for semi - central au+au collisions at the top rhic energy @xcite , including the specific non - gaussian tails observed in the pair momentum and beam direction projections of the experimental source function . in this article",
    "we present the results of fitting the experimental data from @xcite within the analytical model @xcite where the gaussian parametrization for the emission source function is utilized , and the corresponding gaussian radii are extracted from the hkm model simulations .",
    "the star collaboration studied @xcite baryon - baryon @xmath0 and baryon - antibaryon @xmath7 correlation functions in 10% most central rhic au+au collisions at @xmath2  gev . protons and antiprotons in transverse momentum range @xmath8  gev / c with the rapidity @xmath9 , and lambdas and antilambdas with @xmath10  gev / c and @xmath11 were selected for the analysis .",
    "the experimental correlation function is constructed as the ratio of the distribution of particle momentum in the pair rest frame , @xmath12 , in the same events to the analogous distribution in mixed events .",
    "then the measured correlation function @xmath13 is corrected for the pair purity , defined as the fraction of correctly identified primary particle pairs among all the selected ones , to give the corrected function @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pair purity .",
    "the estimated mean pair purity in the experiment is @xmath17 .    to fit the experimental correlation function the lednick and lyuboshitz analytical model @xcite is used , which connects the two - particle correlation function @xmath18 with the particle emission source size @xmath19 and the s - wave strong interaction scattering amplitudes @xmath20 at a given total pair spin @xmath21 . in the equal - time approximation ,",
    "valid on condition @xmath22 for @xmath23 respectively , the correlation function can be calculated as a square of the wave function @xmath24 , representing the stationary solution of the scattering problem with the opposite sign of the vector @xmath25 , averaged over the total spin @xmath21 and the distribution of the relative distances @xmath26 : @xmath27 in typical nuclear collisions the source radius can be considered much larger than the range of the strong interaction potential , so @xmath24 at small @xmath28 can be approximated by the s - wave solution in the outer region : @xmath29 the effective range approximation for the s - wave scattering amplitude is utilized @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the scattering length and @xmath32 is the effective radius for a given total spin @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the particles are assumed to be emitted unpolarized ( i.e. with the polarization @xmath35 ) , so that the fraction of pairs in the singlet state @xmath36 , and in the triplet state @xmath37 .    the normalized separation distribution ( source function ) @xmath38",
    "is assumed to be gaussian one @xmath39 where @xmath40 is considered as the effective radius of the source .    under such assumptions",
    "the correlation function can be calculated analytically : @xmath41,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the term @xmath44 in this expression corresponds to the correction accounting for a deviation of @xmath24 from the true wave function inside the range of the strong interaction potential .",
    "so , the model has quite a large number of parameters , being the scattering lengths @xmath31 and effective radii @xmath32 , which may both be complex in general case , and the source radius @xmath40 .",
    "although in principle all of them can be determined from the measured data , in each concrete situation the number of free parameters can be reduced by making certain reasonable assumptions about the values of some of them .    in our study",
    "the source radius @xmath40 is extracted from the gaussian fit to the source functions calculated in hybrid hkm model .",
    "the simulation of the full process of evolution of the system formed in nuclear or particle collision in hybrid hkm consists of two stages .",
    "the first one is hydrodynamical expansion of thermally and chemically equilibrated matter described within ideal hydrodynamics approximation with the lattice - qcd inspired equation of state  @xcite ( corrected for small but nonzero chemical potentials ) , which is matched with the hadron - resonance gas in chemical equilibrium via cross - over type transition .",
    "the second stage consists in gradual system decoupling after loosing chemical and thermal equilibrium . it can be described either within hydrokinetic approach with switching to urqmd cascade at some space - like hypersurface situated behind the hadronization one , or with sudden switch to urqmd cascade at the hadronization hypersurface . in current study",
    "we choose the second variant of switching to cascade , basing on @xcite , where the comparison of one- and two - particle spectra , calculated at both types of matching hydro and cascade stages for rhic and lhc energies , showed a fairly small difference between them .",
    "the model provides particle distribution functions @xmath45 at the chosen switching hypersurface .",
    "using the monte - carlo procedure , one generates particle momenta and coordinates according to these distributions , which serve as the input for the urqmd hadronic cascade .    to perform a specific calculation",
    "one should specify the initial conditions for the hydrodynamics stage attributed to the starting proper time @xmath46 .",
    "these conditions are the initial energy density ( or entropy ) profile @xmath47 and the initial rapidity profile ( initial flow ) @xmath48 . here",
    "we suppose longitudinal boost - invariance and use @xmath49 corresponding to the mc - glauber model calculated with glissando code @xcite . the maximal energy density @xmath50 is chosen to reproduce the experimental mean charged particle multiplicity , and the initial flow",
    "is supposed to be @xmath51 , with @xmath52  fm for top rhic energy .",

    "one can notice that hkm predicts @xmath4 source function having non - gaussian tails .",
    "the similar behavior was observed experimentally @xcite and reproduced in hkm simulations @xcite for pion source function . in @xmath4 case",
    "these tails appear partially because of the averaging over a wide @xmath70 interval .",

    "however , residual correlations were not taken into account in the star analysis  @xcite .",
    "constructing the experimental correlation function one usually supposes that only the pairs composed of two primary particles are correlated , and the rest of the pairs , which include secondary or misidentified particles , are supposed to be uncorrelated .",
    "however , among such pairs the so - called residual correlations can exist .",
    "they occur if the parent of a particle from such a pair was correlated with another particle forming the pair . for example , if @xmath93 , correlated with some @xmath94 , decays into proton and @xmath95 , then this proton will be residually correlated with the @xmath94 .",
    "the interactions in most of such pairs are unknown , so at the moment there is no possibility to reliably refine the constructed experimental correlation function from the effect of residual correlations .",
    "however , one can try to account for the residual correlations at least phenomenologically using a simple analytical approximation to the residual correlation function .",
    "note that the effect of the residual correlations has presumably only a minor influence on the baryon - baryon @xmath4 correlation function since in this case there are not so many inelastic channels open for parent fsi near threshold and if open , they are usually suppressed also being near threshold .",
    "so , @xmath89 for parent pairs ( giving negative contribution to residual correlation function ) is expected to be small and the sign of @xmath88 may vary from one parent pair to another , thus likely reducing the net effect of @xmath88 on residual correlation function .",
    "in contrast to this , in case of @xmath96 correlation function there is a number of annihilation channels significantly contributing to @xmath89 and leading to a substantial negative contribution to residual correlation function .    in the case",
    "when the measured baryon - antibaryon correlation function is not corrected for purity , the fitted uncorrected correlation function is expressed through the true one in ( [ ll ] ) similar to ( [ l2 ] ) : @xmath97 the pair purity @xmath16 in our calculations is extracted according to ( [ l10 ] ) from the plots of @xmath98 and @xmath99 provided in @xcite .",
    "the first term in formula ( [ l10 ] ) corresponds to the pairs of correlated ( primary only ) particles , and the second one represents the contribution of the uncorrelated pairs , where one or both particles are misidentified or secondary ones . assuming that among the latter there can be residually correlated pairs , one should modify this expression to account for the residual correlations as well .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite , the account for residual correlations is performed by summarizing all the contributions from different parent pairs to the full correlation function , making , however , a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "particularly , the purity @xmath28-dependence is neglected in their analysis . as for the scattering parameters @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath101 of the parent systems and the corresponding parent source radii @xmath102 , the effective range parameters @xmath101 are neglected and @xmath100 and @xmath102 are assumed to be equal to universal baryon - antibaryon values .    as compared with @xcite ,",
    "we propose here the alternative approach avoiding such a detailed ( containing however a number of assumptions ) calculation of the residual correlations .",
    "instead , we are aiming to describe them by introducing some effective residual correlation function @xmath103 for a fraction @xmath104 of the pairs of particles supposed earlier in eq .",

    "one may approximate @xmath104 with a constant ( e.g. , put @xmath108 , which is the total fraction of the pairs containing daughter particles as given in table iii of @xcite ) or assume it proportional to the fraction of non - primary particles : @xmath109 $ ] , where @xmath110 is a fit parameter .",
    "choosing the concrete form of @xmath103 requires some additional analysis .",
    "first of all , one should take into account that due to the phase space suppression of small @xmath28-values , the baryon - antibaryon correlations are dominated by the effect of wide annihilation dips in parent correlation functions related with @xmath111 through the negative last term in eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) .",
    "the parent decays widen these dips and wash out possible structures at small @xmath28 related with @xmath112 .",
    "further , the contribution to the @xmath103 from a given parent correlation function recovers the latter for @xmath28 larger than the parent decay momenta , i.e. for sufficiently large @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "moreover , following from large-@xmath114 behavior of the functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the parent correlation functions approach unity from below according to a universal inverse power law @xmath117 , where the power @xmath118 increases with the number of terms essentially contributing in the effective range expansion in a given @xmath28-interval .",
    "particularly , @xmath119 if one may neglect already the effective range parameters @xmath101 ( i.e. neglect the @xmath28-dependence of the effective range function ) : @xmath120 } \\rightarrow z^{-3},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 , @xmath122 . for practical calculations ,",
    "one may follow @xcite and assume approximately the same source radii and scattering parameters for all baryon - antibaryon systems . then",
    ", one can approximate @xmath123 at large enough @xmath114 by the @xmath96 correlation function @xmath124 and approximately account for the washing out effect of parent decays by smoothly tailing the latter at some value @xmath125 to a slowly varying function @xmath126 : @xmath127    using the effective expression ( [ g0 ] ) for @xmath128 and data points from @xcite , one can reproduce the results obtained in @xcite but in much simpler way .",

    "they agree within the errors with the result from @xcite : @xmath137  fm , @xmath138  fm , @xmath139  fm .",

    "it is worth noting that even if keeping the universality assumption , the account of additional complex expansion parameters would make the fit quite unstable and unpractical at given statistical errors .",
