    "these are quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods , chosen since dmc gives the exact ground state energy subject to the fixed node approximation , and both are expected to give more accurate results than the stls approach used by @xcite .",

    "however , it is computationally more stable to minimize the variance in the estimates of the local energy .",
    "as vmc obeys the variational principle by construction , it yields an upper bound to the true ground state energy .    the more accurate dmc algorithm is a stochastic method that begins with a trial or guiding wave function , in this case the optimized vmc trial wave function .",
