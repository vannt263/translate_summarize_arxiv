    "heightened interest to two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures with quantum well of gapless semiconductors is caused by the fact that different types of the carrier energy spectrum could be realized in these structures depending on the width ( @xmath0 ) of quantum well .",
    "the most detailed , both theoretically and experimentally , heterostructures with hg@xmath1cd@xmath2te / hgte / hg@xmath1cd@xmath2te quantum well were studied .",
    "the calculations of the energy spectrum in framework of _ kp _ method for symmetrical quantum well show that there is the critical width of the hgte quantum well , @xmath3  nm , when the linear in quasimomentum dirac - like energy spectrum should be realized at small quasimomentum ( @xmath4 ) @xcite . at @xmath5",

    "another approach , the calculation in the framework of tight - binding model , which takes into account the bulk inversion asymmetry of the zinc blende lattice , gives close result regarding the dependence @xmath7 except the fact that the relatively large anti - crossing at @xmath8 and large spin - orbit ( so ) splitting of the conduction and valence band appears at @xmath9 .",
    "knowledge of the energy spectrum is necessary for an understanding of all properties of 2d systems : optical , transport and others .",
    "however it has been experimentally studied rather superficially to date .",
    "the energy spectrum of the conduction band was studied more detailed @xcite .",
    "there was shown that the so splitting of the conduction band in the technologically symmetric quantum wells was not reveal itself in the most cases , the effective mass of the electrons increased with their density .",
    "these data were found in satisfactory agreement with results of theoretical calculations performed in the framework of the _ kp _ method .",
    "the energy spectrum of the valence band is investigated still less and , what is important , the experimental data are inconsistent with theoretical results in many cases .",
    "so in the structures with @xmath10  nm that corresponds to the inverted energy spectrum , the hole effective mass ( @xmath11 ) within wide hole density range @xmath12  @xmath13 occurs substantially less than that calculated within _ kp _ method : @xmath14 @xcite instead of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these calculations predict also that the conduction band should overlap with the valence band which top is located at @xmath16 when @xmath17  nm .",

    "they show that all the results are well described under assumption that the top of the valence band is very strongly split by so interaction .",
    "they supposed that the reason for such a splitting is a strong electric field of _ p - n _ junction of technological origin in which the quantum is embedded .",
    "the authors were unable to investigate the splitting of the conduction band .",
    "these data would make the interpretation more reliable .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the results of an experimental study both of hole and electron transport in hgte quantum well of different width near the critical point @xmath22 with a normal and inverted energy spectra .",
    "the measurements were performed over a wide range of carrier density .",
    "it has been experimentally found that the valence band is strongly split by so interaction , while the conduction band remains unsplit independently of energy band ordering .",
    "we believe that the natural interface inversion asymmetry of zinc - blende heterostructures is responsible for these peculiarities .",
    "quantitatively , the experimental data are well described in the framework of atomistic calculation @xcite .",
    "our samples with hgte quantum wells were realized on the basis of hgte / hg@xmath1cd@xmath23te ( @xmath24 ) heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy on gaas substrate with the ( 013 ) surface orientation @xcite .",
    "the samples were mesa etched into standard hall bars of @xmath25  mm width and the distance between the potential probes of @xmath25  mm . to change and control the carrier density in the quantum",
    "well , the field - effect transistors were fabricated with parylene as an insulator and aluminium as a gate electrode .",
    "for each heterostructure , several samples were fabricated and studied .",
    "the measurements were performed at temperatures of @xmath26  k.",
    "it is very important for interpretation of the experimental results to know whether the spectrum of structure under study is normal or inverted .",
    "the values of quantum well width presented in the table  [ tab1 ] are technological , therefore it is very desirable to have independent data on the spectrum type .",
    "the most reliable method to determine the type of the spectra can be based on the peculiarity of the spectrum quantization in the external magnetic field .",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite and experimental investigations @xcite show that there are two anomalous landau levels which behavior is radically different for the normal and inverted spectra [ figs .  [ f1](c ) and [ f1](f ) ] .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ f1](f ) the landau levels @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the structure with inverted spectrum start at @xmath29 from the bottom of the conduction band and top of the valence , respectively , and moving towards each other cross in the magnetic field @xmath30 . this magnetic field increases with @xmath0 increase ,",

    "the energy positions of the anomalous landau levels at @xmath33 is opposite : the level @xmath27 starts from the valence band top while the level @xmath28 goes from the conduction band bottom . because they move in the same directions as for @xmath6 , the crossing does not occur in this case [ fig .",
    "[ f1](c ) ] . thus , if the crossing of landau levels is detected experimentally , the real width of the hgte quantum well is greater than critical value @xmath22 and the sample under study is in inverted regime .    when @xmath34 is large enough",
    "so that the anomalous landau levels have a large density of states and are well separated , the cross manifests itself as the nonmonotonic peculiarity in the @xmath35  vs  @xmath36 and @xmath37  vs  @xmath36 dependences @xcite .",
    "when the quantum well width is close to the critical value @xmath22 , the cross of the landau levels occurs at so low magnetic field that it may not reveal itself in magnetotransport measurements .",
    "it is possible in this case to observe the cross by studying the behavior of the quantum capacitance ( @xmath38 ) in the magnetic field at the gate voltages close to the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) . unlike the resistance components which depend not only on the density of states ( @xmath39 ) but on the disorder strength also , the quantum capacitance depends on the density of states only , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 stands for the chemical potential .",
    "so , the value of @xmath38 at @xmath42 should increase with growing @xmath36 , achieve the maximal value at @xmath30 and , then , decrease with the further increase of magnetic field even when the landau levels are rather broadened .",
    "when the fermi level is located in the bands at @xmath43 , the maximum in the dependence @xmath44 should be also observed but in the higher magnetic fields as compared with @xmath34 .    in the structures with normal energy spectrum",

    "the analogous maximum in the dependence @xmath44 at @xmath46 close to @xmath50 was also observed in the structures 1022 and 1121 .",
    "the @xmath34 values obtained in such a manner for these three structures are listed in the table  [ tab1 ] .    as for the remaining four heterostructures ,",

    ".    such a difference between the hole density found from the sdh oscillations within the proposed model and the hole density found from the hall effect takes place over the whole hole density range in all the structures investigated . thus the interpretation described above",

    "the only interpretation that adequately describes our results is as follows .",

    "p - n _ junction that in its turn results in strong bychkov - rashba effect .",
    "it has been shown that the _ kp _ model describes the valence band spectrum quantitatively .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable in that paper to study the conduction band with the accuracy needed to obtain the so splitting reliably . for heterostructures studied in the present paper it was possible .",
    "let us now compare the experimental results obtained in the present paper both for the valence and conduction bands with the results calculated within framework of the _ kp _ model used in ref .  @xcite . as before , we use here the six - band kane hamiltonian .",
    "the direct integration technique is applied to solve the shrdinger equation as described in ref .",
    "the other parameters were the same as in refs .  @xcite .",
    "as in the previous paper @xcite , the value of electric field serves as the fitting parameter , which provides the ratio between the hole densities in the split subbands , which is observed experimentally ( see fig .  [ f15 ] ) .",
    "it is approximately equal to @xmath146  mv@xmath147 for all the structures under study .",
    "let us now inspect the so splitting of the conduction band .",
    "the calculated energy spectrum for the heterostructures with @xmath5 and @xmath6 is shown fig .",
    "the energy splitting @xmath143 as a function of the quasimomentum value is shown in the insets .",
    "it is seen that the splitting of the conduction band at low @xmath4 values , @xmath148  @xmath19 , is much larger than that of the valence band for @xmath5 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the situation is opposite ; the valence band is split much stronger than the conduction band .",
    "such relationships between splittings agree with the known result of symmetry analysis according to which @xmath149 for the c1 band and @xmath150 for the h1 band near @xmath8 .",
    "it should be emphasized that so low quasimomentum values correspond to very low carrier densities ( @xmath151  @xmath13 and less ) which are inaccessible experimentally . at larger quasimomentum values",
    ", these relationships are violated .",
    "the splitting values of c1 and h1 bands become close to each other . as seen from fig .",
    "[ f16 ] the difference in the spin - orbit splitting for the valence and conduction bands does not exceed @xmath152  % for both heterostructures for @xmath153  @xmath19 that corresponds to the actual carrier density range @xmath154  @xmath13 [ see fig .  [ f15 ] ] .    in order to compare the results of the _ kp _ calculations with the experimental data",
    ", we have calculated the carrier density in the split subbands as @xmath155 and plotted the @xmath156 to @xmath157 and @xmath158 to @xmath159 ratios against the total carrier density in fig .  [ f15 ] by the dashed lines .",
    "it is evident that this model perfectly describes the data relating to the hole split subband and gives no agreement with the experimental results concerning the conduction band splitting .",
    "one of the reason why the used _",
    "kp _ model fails when compared with the experiment is the fact that it ignores the asymmetry caused by the difference of the quantum well interfaces .",
    "the role of the bulk inversion asymmetry of host crystals and interface inversion asymmetry in the so splitting of the energy spectrum of 2d carriers was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the symmetry analysis and atomistic calculations",
    "the authors obtain surprising result .",
    "the asymmetry of cdte / hgte and hgte / cdte interfaces forming the cdte / hgte / cdte quantum well results in the giant splitting of the energy spectrum ; in the quantum wells of critical and close - to - critical width , @xmath160 , the splitting reaches a value of about @xmath161  mev .",
    "analogous calculations have been performed for our concrete case of ( 013 ) hgte .",
    "the quantum well was supposed symmetric in the sense that no electric field was applied across the the well . the microscopical strain has been calculated in the atomistic valence force field model @xcite and then incorporated in the tight - binding using standard procedure @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding parameters used in calculations were obtained using procedure similar to that described in details in the supplemental material to ref .",
    "@xcite with the following modification . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the change of the ionicity across the interface may be extracted from the atomic levels obtained in _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "instead , one may introduce more physical parameter , the change of electrostatic potential on anion across the interface , and fit this parameter to reproduce the expected properties of the interface .",
    "tight - binding parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite correspond to the change of electrostatic potential on te between the quantum well and barrier equal to @xmath106  ev , which is in accordance with _ ab initio _ calculations of hgte / cdte heteropair . for the interface between hgte and hg@xmath1cd@xmath23te ( @xmath162 ) alloy this parameter",
    "should be reduced to @xmath163  mev which leads to proportional reduction of the interface - induced spin splitting .",
    "the carrier densities in the subbands were calculated as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the area inside the fermi contour , which is not a circle due to absence of axial symmetry .",
    "the results of calculations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ f15 ] by the solid lines .",
    "one can see that the atomistic calculations describe the experimental so splitting of the spectrum reasonably not only for the valence band but for the conduction band also .",
    "it is necessary to stress that no fitting parameters have been used in calculations .     for structures 1122 ( a ) and 1023 ( b ) with normal and inverted spectra , respectively , calculated within the six - band kane model in the presence of electric field @xmath146  mv@xmath147 . in the inserts ,",
    "the so splitting plotted against the quasimomentum value . ]",
    "we have studied the energy spectrum of the conduction and valence bands of 2d states in hgte quantum well by means of magnetotransport measurements .",
    "the structures investigated have the width of the quantum wells close to the critical value @xmath160 where the spectrum changes from normal ( at @xmath5 ) to inverted ( at @xmath6 ) .",
    "simultaneous analysis of the sdh oscillations and hall effect over the wide range of the electron and hole densities gives surprising result : the top of the valence band is strongly split by spin - orbit interaction while the splitting of the conduction band is absent , within experimental accuracy .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the results obtained in the tilted magnetic fields .",
    "the behavior of the sdh oscillations of electron conductivity with the changing tilt angle corresponds to the case when the orbital quantization is determined by normal component of the magnetic field , while the spin splitting is determined by the total field .",
    "the oscillations of the hole conductivity are totally determined by the normal component of the magnetic field indicating the so interaction wins the zeeman effect in the actual magnetic field range .",
    "surprisingly , but such a ratio of the splittings is observed as for structures with normal spectrum ( @xmath5 ) so for structures with inverted one ( @xmath6 ) . these data are inconsistent with the _ kp _ calculations which take into account the bychkov - rashba effect caused by electric field directed across the quantum well .",
