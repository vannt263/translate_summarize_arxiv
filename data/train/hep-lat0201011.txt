    "the breaking of cp symmetry ( `` cp violation '' ) , the composition of parity and charge conjugation , is an interesting phenomenon for several reasons :    \\a .",
    "cp violation together with cpt symmetry implies non - invariance of the microscopic equations of motion under motion - reversal .",
    "cp violation rather than c violation implies different physical properties of matter and antimatter .",
    "these two facts are of fundamental importance for our understanding of the laws of nature , and they were perceived as revolutionary , when cp violation was discovered in 1964 @xcite .",
    "they were also important in the development of the fundamental theory of particles , since the observation of cp violation motivated some early extensions of the standard model as it was known at the time ( 1973 ) , either by extending the higgs sector @xcite or by adding a third generation of quarks and leptons @xcite .",
    "nature has opted for the second possibility for certain and the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism of cp violation has become part of today s standard model . from today",
    "s perspective motion - reversal non - invariance and the distinction of matter and antimatter , though fundamental , appear no longer surprising and even `` natural '' .",
    "what remains surprising , however , is the peculiar way in which cp violation occurs or rather does not occur in the standard model and its possible extensions .",
    "assuming that the evolution of the universe began from a matter - antimatter symmetric state , cp violation is necessary @xcite to generate the matter - antimatter asymmetric universe that one observes today . at the electroweak phase transition",
    "the standard model satisfies all the other necessary criteria for baryogenesis ( baryon number violation , departure from thermal equilibrium ) @xcite , but cp violation in the standard model is too weak to explain the observed baryon - to - photon ratio . with the above assumption on the initial condition of the cosmic evolution , our own existence provides evidence for a source of cp violation beyond the standard model .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis has the attractive feature that it couples the required new mechanisms of cp violation to the electroweak scale , therefore making them testable also in particle collider experiments .",
    "nevertheless it now appears more likely that the matter - antimatter asymmetry is not related to the sources of cp violation that one may observe at colliders .",
    "two facts have contributed to this change of perspective : first , the lower limit on the masses of higgs bosons has been increasing .",
    "a heavier higgs boson implies a weaker ( first - order ) electroweak phase transition . as",
    "a consequence electroweak baryogenesis is already too weak over most of the parameter space of even the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "second , the observation of small neutrino masses through neutrino oscillations is explained most naturally by invoking the seesaw mechanism , which in turn is most naturally realized by postulating massive neutrinos , which are singlets under the standard model gauge group .",
    "all three necessary conditions for the generation of lepton number are naturally realized in the decay of the massive neutrino(s ) .",
    "lepton number is then partially converted into baryon number via b+l - violating ( but b  l conserving ) sphaleron transitions @xcite .",
    "while the leptogenesis scenario is very appealing , the new sources of cp violation related to the yukawa couplings of the heavy neutrinos occur at scales of order of the heavy neutrino mass , @xmath0 ( needed to explain the small left - handed neutrino masses ) , and are not directly testable with collider experiments in the near future . for this reason , cp violation in the context of baryogenesis",
    "will not be discussed further in this talk .",
    "cp violation in the standard model is essentially an electroweak phenomenon originating from the yukawa couplings of the quarks to the higgs boson .",
    "this implies that probes of cp violation are indirect probes of the electroweak scale or tev scale , complementary to direct probes such as the observation of higgs bosons .",
    "this is probably the most important reason for the current interest in cp symmetry breaking : in addition to testing the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism of cp violation in the standard model , experiments directed at cp violation limit the construction of extensions of the standard model at the tev scale .",
    "there is an analogy between cp symmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking . both occur at the electroweak scale and for both the standard model provides a simple mechanism .",
    "however , neither of the two symmetry breaking mechanisms has been sufficiently tested up to now .",
    "such tests may or may not confirm the standard model mechanisms but they may also provide answers to questions that concern the structure of the standard model in its entirety , such as the origin of the electroweak scale and the origin of flavour and cp violation .    \\d . leaving aside the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe as evidence for cp violation since this depends on a further assumption , cp violation has now been observed in the weak interactions of quarks in three different ways : in the mixing of the neutral kaon flavour eigenstates ( @xmath1 , 1964 ) @xcite ; in the decay amplitudes of neutral kaons ( @xmath2 , 1999 ) @xcite ; in the mixing of the neutral @xmath3 meson flavour eigenstates ( @xmath4 , 2001 ) @xcite",
    ". it will be seen below that these pieces of data together with others not directly related to cp violation suggest that the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism of cp violation is most likely the dominant source of cp violation at the electroweak scale .",
    "the latest piece of evidence also rules out that cp symmetry is an approximate symmetry .",
    "a consequence of this is that generic extensions of the standard model at the tev scale , needed to explain the stability of the electroweak scale , suffer from a cp fine - tuning problem since any such extension implies the existence of many new cp - violating parameters which have no generic reason to be small . despite the apparent success of the standard theory of cp violation , the problem of cp and flavor violation therefore remains as mysterious as before .",
    "the three quantities listed above establish cp violation unambiguously , but since the observables depend on decays of mesons at low energy , interpreting these quantities in terms of cp - violating fundamental parameters of the theory often involves a very difficult strong interaction problem .",
    "chiral perturbation theory and the heavy quark expansion provide analytic tools to address this problem for kaon and @xmath5 meson decays , respectively .",
    "in addition , lattice qcd can contribute substantially to making the theoretical prediction for many ( but not all ) quantities relevant to cp violation more precise .",
    "cp violation can occur in the standard model in three different ways :      the strong interactions could be cp - violating @xcite .",
    "the topology of gauge fields implies that the correct vacuum is given by a superposition @xmath7 of the degenerate vacua @xmath8 in which pure gauge fields have winding number @xmath9 .",
    "correlation functions in the @xmath6-vacuum can be computed by adding to the lagrangian the term @xmath10 where @xmath6 now represents a parameter of the theory .",
    "physical observables can depend on @xmath6 only through the combination @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the quark mass matrix .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath13 violates cp symmetry .",
    "it also implies an electric dipole moment of the neutron of order @xmath14 .",
    "the non - observation of any such electric dipole moment constrains @xmath15 and causes what is known as the strong cp problem , since the standard model provides no mechanism that would require @xmath16 to vanish naturally .",
    "the strong cp problem has become more severe with the observation of large cp violation in @xmath5 meson decays since one now knows with more confidence that the quark mass matrix has no reason to be real a priori .",
    "there exist mechanisms that render @xmath17 exactly or very small through renormalization effects .",
    "none of these mechanisms is convincing enough to provide a default solution to the problem .",
    "what makes the strong cp problem so difficult to solve is that one does not have a clue at what energy scale the solution should be sought . strong cp violation is not discussed further in this talk ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the standard model is an effective theory defined by its gauge symmetries and its particle content .",
    "cp violation appears in the lepton sector if neutrinos are massive .",
    "the leading operator in the effective lagrangian is @xcite @xmath18[h^t i\\sigma^2 l_j].\\ ] ] after electroweak symmetry breaking this generates a majorana neutrino mass matrix with three cp - violating phases .",
    "one of these phases could be observed in neutrino oscillations , the other two phases only in observables sensitive to the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "unless the @xmath19 are extremely small , the scale @xmath20 must be large to account for small neutrinos masses , which suggests that leptonic cp violation is related to very large scales .",
    "for example , the standard see - saw mechanism makes the @xmath19 dependent on the cp - violating phases in the heavy gauge - singlet neutrino mass matrix . as a consequence",
    "one may have interesting model - dependent relations between leptogenesis , cp violation in lepton - flavour violating processes and neutrino physics , but since the observations are all indirect through low - energy experiments , one may at best hope for accumulating enough evidence to make a particular model particularly plausible .",
    "such experiments seem to be possible , but not in the near future and for this reason leptonic cp violation is not discussed further here .",
    "it should be noted that there is in general no connection between cp violation in the quark and lepton sector except in grand unification models in which the two relevant yukawa matrices are related .",
    "even then further assumptions are necessary for a quantitative relation .",
    "cp violation can appear in the quark sector of the standard model at the level of renormalizable interactions @xcite .",
    "the quark yukawa interactions read @xmath21 with @xmath22 the left - handed quark su(2)-doublets , @xmath23 and @xmath24 the right - handed su(2 ) singlets and @xmath25 the generation index . the complex mass matrices that arise after electroweak symmetry breaking are diagonalized by separate unitary transformations @xmath26 of the left- and right - handed up- and down - type fields .",

    ", the ckm matrix contains one physical cp - violating phase . any cp - violating observable in flavour - violating processes",
    "must be related to this single phase .",
    "the verification or , perhaps rather , falsification of this highly constrained scenario is the primary goal of many current @xmath5- and @xmath30-physics experiments .",
    "this type of cp violation is therefore discussed in some detail in later sections",
    ".    for reasons not understood the ckm matrix has a hierarchical structure as regards transitions between generations .",
    "it is therefore often represented in the approximate form @xcite 0.05 cm @xmath31 -\\lambda & 1-\\lambda^2/2 & a\\lambda^2 \\\\[0.2 cm ] a\\lambda^3 ( 1-\\rho - i\\eta ) & -a\\lambda^2 & 1 \\end{array}\\right )   %",

    "it is the great achievement of heavy quark theory of the 1990s to have determined @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath33 , to the accuracy of a few percent , whereas determining @xmath34 and @xmath35 with this accuracy remains a challenge for this decade .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix leads to a number of relations between rows and columns of the matrix .",
    "the one which is most useful for @xmath5-physics is obtained by multiplying the first column by the complex conjugate of the third : @xmath38 if @xmath39 ( which implies cp violation ) this relation can be represented as a triangle in the complex plane , called the unitarity triangle .",
    "see figure  [ fig1 ] , which also introduces some notation for the angles of the triangle that will be referred to later on .",
    "the hierarchy of the ckm matrix implies that cp violation is a small effect in the standard model .",
    "more precisely , cp - violating observables are either small numbers , or else they are constructed out of small numbers such as small branching fractions of rare decays .",
    "the hierarchy of quark masses and mixing angles represents a puzzle , sometimes called the flavour problem , which will also not be discussed further in this talk .",
    "typical attempts to solve the flavour problem focus on broken generation symmetries .",
    "in the following i review the current constraints on @xmath40 , the apex of the unitarity triangle , and the prospects for improving these constraints . ( the definitions @xmath41 render the location of the apex accurate to order @xmath42 @xcite and will be used in the following . )",
    "it is not the purpose of this talk to go into the details of the theoretical calculations that contribute to these constraints .",

    "the inclusive treatment would parallel that of @xmath37 if not the background from @xmath50 transitions had to be suppressed",
    ". distributions in various kinematic variables ( lepton energy , hadronic invariant mass ) have been considered at the price of a more complicated and uncertain theory .",
    "a cut on the leptonic and hadronic invariant mass avoids the kinematic region , where the heavy quark expansion ( in local operators ) is invalid , but the scale of the expansion is now around 2@xmath51gev rather than @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "the exclusive method is not yet competitive , but it will certainly play an important role in an accurate determination of @xmath45 in the future .",
    "the @xmath45-constraint on @xmath56 is particularly important , since it is the only constraint that is based on a tree decay and therefore arguably insensitive to non - standard model interactions .",
    "it constrains the parameters of the ckm matrix even in the presence of new physics and helps to define the standard model reference point .",
    "the error on @xmath45 is also a major component of the error in the indirect determination of @xmath57 from the global fit to @xmath56 discussed below .",

    "the need to control strong interaction effects is closely related to the possibility of observing cp violation in the decay amplitude .",

    "the drawback of these and related modes is that the amplitudes contain more strong interaction parameters than there are observables .",
    "su(3 ) symmetry and the structure of the weak effective hamiltonian allow one to construct a number of interesting bounds on @xmath73 @xcite , but a full understanding of these modes requires a calculation of the penguin - to - tree amplitude ratio including its strong rescattering phase . in the following",
    "i describe very briefly one such method .      in the heavy quark limit",
    "the @xmath131 quark decays into very energetic quarks ( and gluons ) , which must recombine to form two mesons .",
    "methods from the heavy quark expansion and soft - collinear factorization ( `` colour - transparency '' ) can the be argued to imply a factorized form of the amplitude of a decay into two light mesons @xcite .",
    "schematically , @xmath150 & & \\hspace*{-2.8 cm } + \\!\\int \\!\\!d\\xi du dv t^{ii}(\\xi , u , v)\\,\\phi_b(\\xi)\\phi_{m_1}(v )   \\phi_{m_2}(u),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is a form factor , @xmath152 denote light - cone distribution amplitudes and @xmath153 are perturbative hard - scattering kernels , which also contain the strong rescattering phases .",
    "this result is valid up to @xmath132 corrections , some of which can be large .",
    "the extent to which the qcd factorization formalism can be of quantitative use is not yet fully known .",
    "the approach has been successful in explaining the universality of strong - interaction effects in class - i @xmath154 + light meson decays and understanding the non - universality in the corresponding class - ii decays @xcite",
    ". it also appears to account naturally for the magnitude of the @xmath155 branching fractions , sometimes considered as unexpectedly large , but there is currently no test that would allow one to conclude that the computation of strong interaction phases which are either of order @xmath156 or @xmath132 is reliable in the case of penguin - dominated final states @xcite .",
    "such tests will be possible soon and the non - observation of direct cp violation at the current level of sensitivity already supports the idea that strong rescattering effects are suppressed .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the result of a global fit of @xmath40 to cp - averaged @xmath157 branching fractions with a qcd factorization computation used as an input @xcite .",
    "the result is consistent with the standard fit based on meson mixing and @xmath158 , but shows a preference for larger @xmath73 or smaller @xmath158 .",
    "if the estimate of the theory uncertainty ( included in the curves in the figure ) is correct , non - leptonic decays together with @xmath45 from semileptonic decays already imply the existence of a cp - violating phase of @xmath158 .",
    "the @xmath5 factories are already providing data on dozens of rare @xmath5 decay modes .",
    " though probably not very precise  will be necessary to interpret these data beyond `` simple '' quantities like the mixing - induced cp asymmetry in @xmath133 .",
    "the immediate future should be very interesting since the measurements of direct cp asymmetries at the few percent level and the mixing - induced cp asymmetry in @xmath159 decay provide tests of the theoretical framework and further information on cp violation .",
    "subsequent second generation @xmath5 physics experiments will probably supply enough data to rely more and more on measurements and symmetries . altogether",
    "the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism will be decisively and precisely tested , but on the way one can expect many discussions on hadronic physics , imagined and , perhaps , true new physics signals .",
    "lattice calculations will continue to play an important role by making more precise the standard unitarity triangle fit .",
    "they could also provide some of the non - perturbative quantities ( form factors , light - cone - distribution amplitudes ) that are needed in factorization - based calculations of non - leptonic decay amplitudes",
    ". it will be much harder for lattice qcd to make an impact on non - leptonic , exclusive decays directly , since inelastic rescattering dominates final - state interactions and there is currently no method that would allow one to compute this on the lattice .",
    "the emerging success of the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism of cp violation is sometimes accompanied by a sentiment of disappointment that the standard model has not finally given way to a more fundamental theory . however , returning to the perspective of the year 1973 , when the mechanism was conceived , one can hardly feel this way . after all , the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism predicted a new generation of particles on the basis of the tiny and obscure effect of cp violation in @xmath75 mixing .",
    "it then predicted relations between cp - violating quantities in @xmath30 , @xmath125 , @xmath5-physics which a priori might be very different .",
    "the fact that it has taken nearly 30 years to assemble the experimental tools to test this framework does not diminish the spectacular fact that once again nature has realized a structure that was concepted from pure reasoning .",
    "nevertheless several arguments make it plausible that the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism is not the final word on cp violation .",
    "the strong and cosmological cp problem ( baryogenesis ) continue to call for an explanation , probably related to high energy scales . there may be an aesthetic appeal to realizing the full poincar group as a symmetry of the lagrangian , in which case cp and p symmetry breaking must be spontaneous .",
    "one of the strongest arguments is , however , that the electroweak hierarchy problem seems to require an extension of the standard model at the tev scale .",
    "generic extensions have more sources of cp violation than the ckm matrix .",
    "these have not ( yet ) been seen , suggesting that there is some unknown principle that singles out the ckm matrix as the dominant source of flavour and cp violation . in the following",
    "i give a rather colloquial overview of cp violation in generic tev scale extensions of the standard model .",
    "this is perhaps an academic catalogue , but it illustrates how restrictive the kobayashi - maskawa framework is .      extending the higgs sector by just a second doublet opens many new possibilities",
    ". the higgs potential may now contain complex couplings , leading to higgs bosons without definite cp parity , to cp violation in charged higgs interactions , flavour - changing neutral currents , and cp violation in flavour - conserving interactions such as @xmath160 and electric dipole moments .",
    "the lagrangian could also be cp - conserving with cp violation occurring spontaneously through a relative phase of the two higgs vacuum expectations values @xcite .",
    "both scenarios without further restrictions already cause too much cp violation and flavour - changing neutral currents , so that either the higgs bosons must be very heavy or some special structure imposed . for example , discrete symmetries may imply that up - type and down - type quarks couple to only one higgs doublet , a restriction known as `` natural flavour conservation '' @xcite , since it forbids flavour - changing neutral currents ( and also makes spontaneous cp violation impossible with only two doublets ) . with flavour conservation imposed",
    ", cp and flavour violation occurs through the ckm matrix , but in addition to the usual charged currents also in charged higgs interactions .",
    "this is usually considered in the context of supersymmetry , since extended higgs models suffer from the same hierarchy problem as the standard model .",
    "left - right - symmetric theories with gauge group su(2)@xmath161su(2)@xmath162u(1)@xmath163 are attractive @xcite , because parity and cp symmetry can be broken spontaneously .",
    "the minimal model requires already an elaborate higgs sector ( with triplets in addition to doublets ) and suffers from the hierarchy problem .",
    "cp violation in the quark sector now occurs through left- and right - handed charged currents with their respective ckm matrices .",
    "but since all cp violation arises through a single phase in a higgs vacuum expectation value there is now a conflict between suppressing flavour - changing currents and having this phase large enough to generate the cp violating phenomena already observed .",
    "the minimal left - right symmetric model with spontaneous cp violation is therefore no longer viable @xcite .",
    "the standard model can be extended by an extra @xmath164-type quark with electric charge @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "this quark should be a weak singlet in order not to conflict electroweak precision tests .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the down - quark mass matrix must be diagonalized by a unitary @xmath166 matrix .",
    "the motivation for such an extension of the standard model may be less clear , in particular as there is no symmetry principle that would make the extra singlet quark naturally light .",
    "however , this theory provides an example in which the unitarity triangle does no longer close to a triangle , but is extended to a quadrangle : @xmath167 the unitarity triangle `` deficit '' @xmath168 also determines the strength of tree - level flavour - changing @xmath169 boson couplings and is currently constrained by @xmath58 mixing and rare decays to about a tenth of the length of a side of the triangle .",
    "( the corresponding coupling @xmath170 is constrained much more tightly in the kaon system . )",
    "this model could in principle still give large modifications of @xmath58 mixing and non - leptonic @xmath5 decays , including cp asymmetries @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite is arguably the most natural solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem , but it is not particularly natural in its most general form from the point of view of cp violation .",
    "the lagrangian including the most general lagrangian that breaks supersymmetry softly contains 44 cp - violating constants of nature .",
    "( r - parity conservation is assumed . )",
    "one of them is the usual ckm phase which appears in charged current and chargino interactions .",
    "three phases appear in flavour - conserving cp observables , 27 in flavour- and cp - violating quark - squark - gluino interactions ( squark mass matrices and @xmath33-terms ) and 13 in the ( s)lepton sector .",
    "the flavour - conserving phases must be small to comply with the non - observation of electric dipole moments .",
    "an intriguing feature of supersymmetry is the existence of cp and flavour violation in strong interactions ( gluinos , squarks ) .",
    "these interactions can be much stronger than the standard model weak interactions and to suppress them to a phenomenologically acceptable level , one has to assume that either ( some of ) the masses of superparticles are rather large , or that the squark mass matrices are diagonal in the same basis that also diagonalizes the quark mass matrices ( alignment ) or that the squarks have degenerate masses , in which case a generalization of the gim mechanism suppresses flavour - changing couplings @xcite .",
    "since almost all cp - violating phases of the minimal supersymmetric standard model originate from supersymmetry breaking terms , one must understand supersymmetry breaking to answer the question why cp and flavour violation are so strongly suppressed .",
    "there exist mechanisms which can naturally realize one or the other of the conditions listed above ( for example supersymmetry breaking through gauge interactions @xcite ) , but none of the mechanisms is somehow singled out .",
    "there is currently much activity aiming at constraining the flavour- and cp - violating couplings from the many pieces of data that become now available .",
    "in fact these couplings are so many - fold that the cp - violating effects observed in kaon and @xmath5 meson decays can all be ascribed to them at the price of making the consistency of the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism appear accidental .",
    "the hope could be that eventually some pattern of restrictions on these small couplings is seen that could give a hint on the origin of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is also plausible to assume that strong flavour and cp violation is absent ( or too small to observe ) in supersymmetry . neglecting also the flavour - conserving cp - violating effects , the ckm matrix is then the only effect of interest .",
    "the presence of additional particles with ckm couplings still implies modifications of meson mixing and rare decays , but these modifications are now much smaller and , in general ( but excepting rare radiative decays ) , precise theoretical results are needed to disentangle them from hadronic uncertainties .    whatever the outcome of the search for new cp violation may be , it will restrict the options for model building severely .",
    "the current data point towards a privileged standing of the ckm matrix .",
    "however , a theoretical rationale for this privileged standing is yet to be discovered .",
    "i. the ( expected ) observation of large cp violation in @xmath5 decays together with @xmath2 and the consistency of indirect determinations of the unitarity triangle imply that :    * cp is not an approximate symmetry of nature  rather cp violation is rare in the standard model because of small flavour mixing . *",
    "the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism of cp violation in charged currents is _ probably _ the _ dominant _ source of cp violation _ at the electroweak scale_.    \\ii .",
    "cp and electroweak symmetry breaking provide complementary motivations to search for extensions of the standard model , but :    * on the one hand , there exists no favoured candidate model for cp violation beyond the standard model  rather there is a cp problem in many conventional extensions .",
    "* on the other hand , baryogenesis requires cp violation beyond the standard model , probably decoupled from cp violation observable at accelerators .",
    "the study of cp violation is at a turning point with many new experimental capabilities and new theoretical methods to interpret non - leptonic decay data .",
    "perhaps the most important result of the near future , however , will be to find ( or not find ) the @xmath142 mass difference @xmath171 , confirming once more the standard model paradigm ( or to put it into serious difficulty ) .",
    "i wish to thank the organizers , f.  jegerlehner and m.  mller - preussker in particular , for their support and endless patience .",
