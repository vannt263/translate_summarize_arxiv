    "the origin and nature of quark and lepton masses and mixings remains one of the most intriguing questions left unanswered by the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . within the sm , quark and lepton masses and mixings arise from yukawa couplings which are essentially free and undetermined . in extensions such as grand unified theories ( guts ) ,",
    "the yukawa couplings within a particular family may be related , but the mass hierarchy between different families is not explained and supersymmetry ( susy ) does not shed any light on this question either .",
    "indeed , in the sm or guts , with or without susy , a specific structure of the yukawa matrices has no intrinsic meaning due to basis transformations in flavour space .",
    "for example , one can always work in a basis in which , say , the up quark mass matrix is taken to be diagonal with the quark sector mixing arising entirely from the down quark mass matrix , or _ vice versa _ , and analogously in the lepton sector ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is symptomatic of the fact that neither the sm or guts are candidates for a theory of flavour .",
    "the situation changes somewhat once these theories are extended to include a family symmetry spontaneously broken by extra higgs fields called flavons .",
    "this approach has recently received a massive impetus due to the discovery of neutrino mass and approximately tri - bimaximal lepton mixing @xcite whose simple pattern strongly suggests some kind of a non - abelian discrete family symmetry might be at work , at least in the lepton sector , and , assuming a gut - type of structure relating quarks and leptons at a certain high energy scale , within the quark sector too .",
    "the observed neutrino flavour symmetry may arise either directly or indirectly from a range of discrete symmetry groups @xcite .",
    "examples of the direct approach , in which one or more generators of the discrete family symmetry appears in the neutrino flavour group , are typically based on @xmath3 @xcite or a related group such as @xmath4 @xcite or @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "models of the indirect kind , in which the neutrino flavour symmetry arises accidentally , include also @xmath6 @xcite as well as @xmath7 @xcite and the continuous flavour symmetries like , e.g. , @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 @xcite which accommodate the discrete groups above as subgroups @xcite .",
    "theories of flavour based on a spontaneously broken family symmetry are constructed in a particular basis in which the vacuum alignment of the flavons is particularly simple .",
    "this then defines a preferred basis for that particular model , which we shall refer to as the `` flavour basis . '' in such frameworks , the resulting low energy effective yukawa matrices are expected to have a correspondingly simple form in the flavour basis associated with the high energy simple flavon vacuum alignment .",
    "this suggests that it may be useful to look for simple yukawa matrix structures in a particular basis , since such patterns may provide a bottom - up route towards a theory of flavour based on a spontaneously broken family symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , experiment does not tell us directly the structure of the yukawa matrices , and the complexity of the problem , in particular , the basis ambiguity from the bottom - up perspective , generally hinders the prospects of deducing even the basic features of the underlying flavour theory from the experimental data .",
    "we are left with little alternative but to follow an _ ad hoc _ approach pioneered some time ago by fritzsch @xcite and currently represented by the myriads of proposed effective yukawa textures ( see e.g.  @xcite ) whose starting assumption is that ( in some basis ) the yukawa matrices exhibit certain nice features such as symmetries or zeros in specific elements which have become known as `` texture zeros . '' for example , in his classic paper , fritzsch pioneered the idea of having six texture zeros in the 1 - 1 , 2 - 2 , 1 - 3 entries of the hermitian up and down quark yukawa ( or mass ) matrices @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these six - zero textures are no longer consistent with experiment , since they imply the bad prediction @xmath10 , so texture zerologists have been forced to retreat to the ( at most ) four - zero schemes discussed , for example , in @xcite which give up on the 2 - 2 texture zeros allowing the good prediction @xmath11 .",
    "however , four - zero textures featuring zeros in the 1 - 1 and 1 - 3 entries of both up and down hermitian mass matrices may also lead to the bad prediction @xmath12 unless @xmath13 results from the cancellation of quite sizeable up- and down - type quark 2 - 3 mixing angles , leading to non - negligible induced 1 - 3 up- and down - type quark mixing @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to give up on the 1 - 3 texture zeros , as well as the 2 - 2 texture zeros , retaining only two texture zeros in the 1 - 1 entries of the up and down quark matrices @xcite .",
    "here we reject both of these options , and instead choose to maintain up to four texture zeros , without invoking cancellations , for example by making the 1 - 1 element of the up ( but not down ) quark mass matrix nonzero , while retaining 1 - 3 texture zeros in both the up and down quark hermitian matrices , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we discuss phenomenologically viable textures for hierarchical quark mass matrices which have both 1 - 3 texture zeros and negligible 1 - 3 mixing in both the up and down quark mass matrices .",
    "such textures clearly differ from the textures discussed in @xcite and @xcite , but include some cases discussed in @xcite , as remarked above .",
    "our main contribution in this paper is to derive quark mixing sum rules applicable to textures of this type , in which @xmath0 is generated from @xmath1 as a result of 1 - 2 up - type mixing , in direct analogy to the lepton sum rules derived in @xcite .",
    "another important result of our study is to use the sum rules to show how the right - angled unitarity triangle , i.e. , @xmath2 , can be accounted for by a remarkably simple scheme involving real mass matrices apart from a single element of either the up or down quark mass matrix being purely imaginary .",
    "fritzsch and xing have previously emphasized how their four - zero scheme with 1 - 1 and 1 - 3 texture zeros in the hermitian up and down mass matrices can be used to accommodate right unitarity triangles @xcite , but since their scheme involves large 2 - 3 and non - negligible 1 - 3 up and down quark mixing , our sum rules are not applicable to their case . therefore , the textures in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite do not allow us to explain @xmath2 by simple structures with a combination of purely real and purely imaginary matrix elements .",
    "recently , it has become increasingly clear that current data is indeed consistent with the hypothesis of a right unitarity triangle , with the best fits giving @xmath14 @xcite , and this provides additional impetus for our scheme . the phenomenological observation that @xmath15 has also motivated other approaches ( see e.g. @xcite ) which are complementary to the approach developed in this paper .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive the quark mixing sum rules , assuming zero up and down quark 1 - 3 mixing angles . in section 3 , using the sum rules , we discuss the phenomenological viability of quark mass matrix textures with 1 - 3 texture zeros , show how modifications in the up sector can achieve viability , and show how @xmath2 allows each matrix element to be either real or purely imaginary . in section 4 ,",
    "in the framework of guts , we discuss the implications of zero 1 - 3 mixing for the charged lepton and neutrino sectors , and show that the quark mixing sum rules may be used to yield an accurate prediction for the reactor angle .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "appendix a shows that textures with nonzero 1 - 3 elements in the up sector are disfavoured .",
    "the mixing matrix in the quark sector , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath16 , is defined as the unitary matrix occurring in the charged current part of the sm interaction lagrangian expressed in terms of the quark mass eigenstates .",
    "these mass eigenstates can be determined from the mass matrices in the yukawa sector , namely @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass matrices of the up - type and down - type quarks , respectively .",
    "the change from the flavour into the mass basis is achieved via bi - unitary transformations @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unitary @xmath25 matrices .",
    "the ckm matrix @xmath26 ( in the `` raw '' form , i.e.  before the `` unphysical '' phases were absorbed into redefinitions of the quark mass eigenstate field operators ) is then given by @xmath27    in this paper we shall use the standard ( or so - called particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite ) parameterisation for the ckm matrix ( after eliminating the `` unphysical '' phases ) with the structure [ updg ] u_ckm = r_23u_13r_12 , where @xmath28 denote real ( i.e.  orthogonal ) matrices , and the unitary matrix @xmath29 contains the observable phase @xmath30 . for more details , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "other alternative parametrisations , motivated by the observation of @xmath2 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) have been suggested , but we prefer to stick to the standard one here .",
    "let us now suppose that @xmath55 . from the sm point of view",
    ", this corresponds to just a convenient choice of basis but , as discussed in the introduction , it becomes a nontrivial assumption at the level of a specific underlying model of flavour . for models",
    "where zero 1 - 3 mixing is realised with flavour symmetries , see e.g.  @xcite . for @xmath55 , eq .  ( [ eq : param3 ] ) simplifies to [ eq : param5 ] u_ckm = u^u_l_12^^u^d_l_23 u^d_l_12 . then , by equating the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : param4 ] ) and ( [ eq : param5 ] ) and expanding to leading order in the small mixing angles , we obtain the following relations ( up to cubic terms in the physical quark mixing angles ) : [ f1 ] _ 23e^-i_23&= & _ 23^de^-i_23^d -_23^ue^-i_23^u , + [ f2 ] _ 13e^-i_13&= & -_12^ue^-i_12^u ( _ 23^de^-i_23^d - _ 23^ue^-i_23^u ) , + [ f3 ] _ 12e^-i_12&= & _ 12^de^-i_12^d -_12^ue^-i_12^u .",
    "let us first consider eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) , which can be transformed into @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 stand for the measurable 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 mixing angles in the quark sector , respectively . taking the modulus of eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta13withphases ] ) , the 1 - 2 angle entering the up - sector rotation ( @xmath31 ) in the flavour basis obeys @xmath59 where the 1@xmath60 errors are displayed @xcite .",
    "similarly , combining eq .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta13withphases ] ) one receives @xmath61 this , together with the identification eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltafromparam1 ] ) gives rise to the quark sector sum rule , the sum rule may be further simplified to @xmath62 . for similar considerations in the lepton sector ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath63 which is valid up to higher order corrections . the present best - fit value and the 1@xmath60 errors are also displayed .    needless to say ,",
    "the relations ( [ eq : quarkrelation ] ) and ( [ eq : quarksumrule ] ) apply at the scale at which the flavour structure emerges , often close to the scale of grand unification .",
    "thus , in principle , the renormalisation group ( rg ) effects should be taken into account .",
    "however , due to the smallness of the mixing angles in the quark sector and the hierarchy of the quark masses , the rg corrections to the above relations are very small and can be neglected to a very good approximation .",
    "it is interesting that , with the 1 - 2 mixing angles in the up and down sector derived from the physical parameters , the 1 - 2 phase difference in the up and down sectors can also be determined . indeed , combining all three equations ( [ f1])-([f3 ] ) , one obtains @xmath64 using eqs .  ( [ eq : quarkrelation ] ) and ( [ eq : quarksumrule ] ) we can solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltadu ] ) for @xmath65 and obtain ( at 1@xmath60 level ) @xmath66 which is remarkably close to @xmath67 .",
    "we emphasise that this is a consequence of zero 1 - 3 mixing in the up and down sectors , @xmath68 .",
    "we now show that , assuming quark textures with negligible 1 - 3 up and down quark mixing , corresponding to 1 - 3 texture zeros for hierarchical quark mass matrices , @xmath65 is approximately equal to @xmath69 .",
    "this comes from the definition of the unitarity triangle angle @xmath69 : @xmath70 for the second term in the argument , we can use eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) , ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) @xmath71 thus , one can see that the angle @xmath69 is nothing but the phase difference @xmath72 , corresponding to a very simple phase sum rule [ phase ] _",

    "according to the phase sum rule in eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) , the experimental observation that @xmath2 , or the equivalent determination in eq .",
    "( [ phasediff ] ) , suggests looking at quark mass matrices with 1 - 3 texture zeros and with @xmath74 or @xmath75 at the special values @xmath76 .",
    "this would correspond to a set of rather specific textures of the quark mass matrices with , for example , purely imaginary 1 - 2 elements in either @xmath18 or @xmath19 while the 2 - 2 elements remain real .",
    "for example , in @xcite the relation between the phases of the mixing angles and the phases of the matrix elements is discussed .",
    "for instance , the following patterns naturally emerge : @xmath77 and/or @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are real parameters , and the elements marked by `` * '' are irrelevant as long as the hierarchy of the mass matrix is large enough , or , equivalently , as long as the mixing angles in @xmath81 and @xmath82 are small .",
    "these textures are all phenomenologically viable , and consistent with @xmath83 , and their simple phase structure provides a post justification of our assumption of 1 - 3 texture zeros and negligible 1 - 3 up- and down - type quark mixing .",
    "however , the above textures are clearly not the most predictive ones and , for example , do not relate the up and down quark 1 - 2 mixing angles to masses .",
    "this requires additional assumptions , such as additional texture zeros and hermitian or symmetric matrices , as we now discuss .      under the additional assumptions of symmetric or hermitian mass matrices in the 1 - 2 block and zero textures in the 1 - 1 positions of the quark mass matrices ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath84 we obtain as additional predictions the gatto - sartori - tonin ( gst ) relations @xcite with 1@xmath60 errors displayed , @xmath85 here we already see a conflict in the up sector .",
    "the prediction for @xmath86 from the sum rule in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quarkrelation ] ) is quite different ( several @xmath60 away ) from the gst relation above .",

    "we consider some examples of possible modifications to the textures in the up sector which are phenomenologically acceptable , while leaving the successful down sector texture unchanged , and retaining the successful real and imaginary scheme which leads to the right unitarity triangle .",
    "as discussed in appendix a , the idea of relaxing the up quark 1 - 3 texture zero is disfavoured , so we restrict ourselves to either relaxing the up quark 1 - 1 texture zero , or relaxing symmetry in the 1 - 2 up quark sector , as discussed below .",
    "one possible modification is to introduce a nonzero element in the 1 - 1 position of the up quark mass matrix , i.e.@xmath94 as a result , we obtain the up sector relation @xmath95 which allows to adjust @xmath96 , which is of the order of the up quark mass , while @xmath97 has to be equal to the value obtained in eq .",

    ", there is still the successful prediction from eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_d_over_m_s ] ) leading to the successful sum rule relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qsplusgst1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in section [ sec : deltackm ] , the dirac phase of the ckm matrix is correct .",
    "we note that there exist several variants of the texture .",
    "for example , we can choose the 1 - 2 element of @xmath19 real , the 1 - 2 element of @xmath18 purely imaginary and all the other elements also real .",
    "these variants are valid as long as @xmath98 is real and @xmath99 is purely imaginary , or _ vice versa_.    we emphasize that the elements marked by `` * '' are irrelevant as long as the hierarchy of the mass matrix is large enough , so they may be replaced by zeros or , if the matrices are hermitian , the 3 - 1 elements may be zero while the 3 - 2 elements are determined by hermiticity . since the sum rule in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) shows that @xmath1 is determined only by the difference in 2 - 3 mixing angles in the up and down sectors , it is also possible to set either @xmath100 or @xmath101 equal to zero without changing the physical predictions . in this way it is possible to arrive at some of the four - zero textures discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize that here we are additionally assuming the real and imaginary structures consistent with the right unitarity triangle and this was not discussed in @xcite .      a second option for a texture consistent with experimental data",
    "consists in relaxing the symmetry of the 1 - 2 block in the up sector , while keeping the texture zero in the 1 - 1 position : @xmath102 the two up - sector relations @xmath103 can be simultaneously fulfilled by choosing @xmath104 and @xmath105 appropriately .",
    "the prediction from eq .",

    "we note that there exist several variants of the texture . as before ,",
    "it is sufficient to have @xmath98 real and @xmath99 purely imaginary , or _ vice versa_.",
    "extending the notion of zero 1 - 3 mixing to the lepton sector ( i.e.  under the assumption of @xmath106 ) , the presently unknown mixing angle @xmath107 of the leptonic ( mns ) mixing matrix satisfies the relation ( analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : quarkrelation ] ) ) ^mns_13 = ^mns_23 ^e_12 , where @xmath108 is the 1 - 2 mixing in the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath109 .",
    "this relation has emerged before , for example , in the context of lepton sum rules in @xcite .    in many classes of gut models of flavour",
    ", the 1 - 2 mixing angles corresponding to @xmath109 and @xmath19 are related by a group theoretical clebsch factor , for example @xmath110 @xcite . in general , it is usually assumed that @xmath111 is of the order of the cabibbo angle , leading to a prediction @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of fritzsch - type textures , which are based on hermitian matrices with 1 - 1 , 2 - 2 and 1 - 3 texture zeros , this prediction can be made more precise by using the sum rule which relates @xmath111 to down - type quark masses .",

    "<S> in analogy with the recently proposed lepton mixing sum rules , we derive quark mixing sum rules for the case of hierarchical quark mass matrices with 1 - 3 texture zeros , in which the separate up and down type 1 - 3 mixing angles are approximately zero , and @xmath0 is generated from @xmath1 as a result of 1 - 2 up type quark mixing . using the sum rules </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the phenomenological viability of such textures , including up to four texture zeros , and show how the right - angled unitarity triangle , i.e. , @xmath2 , can be accounted for by a remarkably simple scheme involving real mass matrices apart from a single element being purely imaginary . in the framework of grand unified theories , </S>",
