    "the 9c survey @xcite mapped 29  deg@xmath1 of sky to 5.5  mjy completeness at 15  ghz , in addition to several larger and shallower areas .",
    "the ryle telescope ( rt ) , which carried out the survey , has subsequently been reconfigured and re - equipped to form the large array ( la ) of the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; * ? ? ?",
    "as part of this metamorphosis , three of the rt s eight antennas were moved to the north of the ( almost ) east - west line on which they originally stood , providing the telescope with north - south baselines .",
    "in addition , new front - end receivers and back - end electronics , including a new correlator , were installed .",
    "the result is a telescope with much larger bandwidth and improved flux - density sensitivity , allowing us to extend our 15-ghz - band survey work to much deeper flux - density levels .",
    "the 9c survey was conceived to provide information regarding the foreground radio sources that contaminated the cosmic microwave background radiation observations of the very small array @xcite .",
    "similarly , the 10c source survey has been designed to complement the other ami science programmes , which also require knowledge of contaminating radio sources .",
    "this paper is focussed on the techniques employed for observing , mapping and source extraction in the 10c survey . in an accompanying paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) the first results from the 10c survey , including the deep 15.7-ghz source count , are presented .",
    "the ami consists of two separate telescopes  the la and small array ( sa ) .",
    "the 10c - survey data were collected using only the la . before proceeding further , the la s",
    "vital statistics are summarised .",
    "the la is an interferometer comprising eight 13-metre - diameter , equatorially - mounted dishes , with a range of baselines of 18110  m. it operates at frequencies between 13.9 and 18.2  ghz with the passband divided into six channels of 0.72-ghz bandwidth .",
    "it has a primary beam at @xmath4  15.7  ghz of @xmath5  arcmin full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) and a typical resolution of @xmath6  arcsec ( this varies depending on the precise _ uv_-coverage of any observation ) .",
    "the telescope measures a single , linear polarisation ( stokes @xmath7 ) and has a flux - density sensitivity of @xmath8  mjy for an integration time of one second .",
    "accurate pointing is important for high - frequency observations because of the relatively small telescope primary beams for such observations .",
    "the la pointing is calibrated using five - point observations of bright point sources , which are carried out on a monthly basis .",
    "the data from five - point observations are used to construct a pointing model which provides the ha and dec .",
    "offset of each antenna at any point in the sky .",
    "after applying these empirical corrections to the data , there is a residual rms antenna pointing error of @xmath6  arcsec . in practice , this is small enough compared with the primary beam size to have no significant effect on the accuracy of source flux densities measured from the raster maps .",
    "it is standard practice , whilst observing using the la , to visit a bright ( @xmath9  mjy ) , unresolved source close ( within a few degrees , if possible ) to the target of interest for one in every 11 minutes .",
    "the majority of these sources are found in the catalogue of the jodrell - vla astrometic survey ( jvas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are used for phase and amplitude calibration of the data .",
    "the la is not yet sufficiently stable to rely on daily la measurements of the primary calibrator sources for flux - density calibration , and so the secondary calibrators are used for flux - density calibration .",
    "the flux densities , in each channel , assumed for these secondary calibrator sources are obtained from sa measurements .",
    "the closest ( in time ) sa observation of the source is selected and the flux densities measured in each channel are adopted as the assumed values for calibrating the la observation . as many of the secondary calibrator sources have varying flux densities , the sa observations are made within 10 days of the relevant la observation . in turn ,",
    "the sa observations are calibrated by using sa observations of the ami primary calibration sources  3c286 and 3c48  each of which are usually observed daily .",
    "the flux densities assumed for 3c286 and 3c48 , in each of the ami frequency channels , are shown in table  [ tab : fluxcal ] . the flux densities for 3c286",
    "were converted from total - intensity measurements provided by r.  perley ( private communication ) and made by the very large array , and are consistent with the @xcite model of mars transferred on to absolute scale , using results from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe_. values for 3c48 were obtained by measuring the ratios of the flux densities of 3c48 to 3c286 using sa observations carried out between 2008 january and 2010 may .    finally , in order to account for phase errors , a correction factor of 1.082 is applied to raster flux densities .",
    "this correction factor was determined using self - calibrated maps of @xmath10 of the brightest sources in the survey fields  the data were collected using pointed observations , which were carried out to check the raster maps flux - density scale and are described in paper ii .",
    ".assumed flux densities for sources used for primary flux - density calibration ( channels one and two are not used routinely , because of interference from satellites ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as noted in section  [ gaussian - fitting ] , criteria for classifying sources as point - like or extended have been developed .",
    "one approach would be to use the residuals from 3-parameter fits , where only the peak brightness , and peak ra and dec .",
    "are allowed to vary , to identify extended sources ; for extended sources the fit is expected to be poor . however , even for point sources the quality of the fit will vary with snr and quantifying this dependence is difficult .",
    "an empirical approach might be possible .",
    "however , a method , based on theory , which makes use of the angular size after deconvolution has been found to provide a straightforward test applicable to a wide range of snrs .",
    "maps containing point sources and noise were simulated in order to investigate the distribution of @xmath11 that would be expected for point sources as a function of snr .",
    "simulated visibilities were generated for point sources using _",
    "uv_-coverage from real observations of a survey field . after simulating the sources and noise in the _",
    "uv_-plane , the resultant multisource _",
    "uv_-fits file was mapped as described in section  [ mapping ] and source extraction was carried out as in section  [ source extraction ] .",
    "point sources were simulated in the _ uv_-plane using a real multisource _",
    "uv_-fits file as a template . the @xmath12 visibility associated with the @xmath13 pointing , @xmath14 ,",
    "was set to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total number of sources , @xmath17 is the primary - beam - corrected flux density of the @xmath18 source , @xmath19 is a phase factor given by @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the _ uv_-coordinates of @xmath14 , and",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the ra and dec .",
    "separations between the @xmath18 source and @xmath13 pointing centre respectively .",
    "a source was only added to any individual pointing if it fell within 15  arcmin of the pointing centre . beyond this distance",
    "its contribution was negligible owing to the fall - off in the primary beam .",
    "gaussian noise was also simulated , such that the noise on each of the component maps was identical , by adding random numbers drawn from a gaussian distribution to the real and imaginary parts of each visibility .",
    "we note that point sources can alternatively be inserted into real raster maps by adding @xmath14 to real multisource _ uv _ data . such simulations were carried out in order to assess the completeness of the 10c survey ( see paper ii ) .",
    "our source extraction techniques were applied to a map of 3.2  deg@xmath1 containing 780 , 100-mjy , simulated point sources  one at each pointing centre .",
    "the rms noise on each component map was simulated to be 10  mjy per beam . once the component maps had been added together , as described in section  [ mapping ] , the resulting rms noise varied between @xmath4 8.6 and 9  mjy per beam over the central area of the raster map . for illustration , a section of this map is shown in fig .

    "increase at each level by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "the fwhm of the restoring beam of one of the component maps is displayed in the bottom left corner of the image . ]",
    "[ fig : hist_size_ps10 ] shows the distribution of @xmath11 for the simulated point sources with snrs of approximately 10 .",
    "it can be seen that it is very rare for a point source to have @xmath26 40  arcsec at this snr . however , as the snr decreases , the distribution was found by doing runs with different source flux densities to move further away from zero and become wider and , as a result , 40  arcsec would not be a suitable dividing line between point and extended sources at all snrs .    the minimum component size , @xmath27 , that can be measured is proportional to the fwhm of the synthesised beam and inversely proportional to the square root of the snr @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : emaj_versus_snr ] shows the median value of @xmath11 versus @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , for artifical point sources with snrs ranging between 7 and 1000 .",
    "it can be seen that the expected relation is obtained for @xmath30 .",
    "the relation starts breaking down at higher snrs .",
    "this is probably due to the limited level of accuracy with which we are able to simulate data , produce maps and recover source parameters .",
    "for instance , the maps have a finite pixel resolution which will affect the accuracy with which angular sizes can be measured . in any case ,",
    "calibration errors are the dominant source of error for @xmath31 .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath32 ought to be a useful indicator of source extension .",
    "[ fig : hist_extent_ps10 ] shows the distribution of @xmath33 for the point sources with snrs of approximately 10 .",
    "fewer than 1.2  per  cent of sources have @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the distributions of @xmath33 for sources with snrs ranging between 7 and 100 were investigated . in each case , less than 1.5  per  cent of sources were found to have @xmath34 . as noted above , at high snrs",
    ", calibration errors will become the main source of uncertainty . as a result ,",
    "sources with @xmath35  arcsec are never considered to be extended , no matter how high the snr .",
    "this value corresponds approximately to the critical value at a snr of 20 , above which calibration errors begin to dominate .",
    "on the basis of our findings , a source is classified as extended if @xmath36 , where @xmath37    clearly , there is no sharp dividing line between point and extended sources , and no single method for making the distinction",
    ". however , the above procedure for estimating source sizes is simple and robust , and is able to deal with sources with a wide range of snrs .",
    "the expected percentage of point sources which are misclassified as extended in this scheme is @xmath38 per cent .",
    "the minimum angular size that can be measured is estimated as a function of both the telescope resolution and the snr .",
    "the median value of @xmath39 for each survey field varies between 32.5 and 42.6  arcsec . ; it is generally lower for a field lying at a higher declination .",
    "[ fig : ecrit_versus_snr ] shows how @xmath27 varies with snr for @xmath40  arcsec .",
    "the method for distinguishing between point and extended sources can be used to establish how best to measure the total flux density of a source .",
    "clearly , @xmath41 should be used to estimate the total flux density of an extended source .",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath41 can be used to describe a point source . however ,",
    "at low snr , the results obtained using @xmath41 will be significantly less accurate given the fact that the source is not assumed to be point - like when measuring @xmath41 . in summary , @xmath42 should be used to describe all sources except those that are classified as extended , for which @xmath41 should be used .",
    "map noise is @xmath43 .",
    "contour levels start at @xmath44 and increase at each level by a factor of @xmath25 . recovered peak source - positions",
    "are indicated with crosses .",

    "the noise levels in the core and extended field areas are typically 50 and @xmath46 respectively . in total , 158 sources were detected above @xmath47 , of which 10 are classed as overlapping .    the gaussian - fitting converged successfully for all sources within 25 iterations .",
    "[ fig : ami002l_comp_flux ] shows how @xmath41 compares with @xmath42 for all sources , 10 of which are classified as extended .",
    "no over - narrow sources were detected .",
    "however , when using a primary beam cut - off of 0.3 to map the data several sources were found to have integrated flux - densities significantly smaller than their peak flux - densities .",
    "this is indicative of a spurious source .",
    "these detections were found to be separated from other sources ( spurious or real ) by a distance much smaller than a synthesised beam fwhm .",
