    "flat galaxy rotation curves and the departure from the expected keplerian fall - off which they imply are most popularly attributed to the presence of cold dark matter [ cdm ] in the galaxy .",
    "together with a cosmological constant @xmath0 , cdm constitutes the highly successful @xmath0cdm model which explains most of cosmological , cluster and galaxy data . nonetheless , considering that dark matter",
    "has not yet been detected in the laboratory , one should tentatively also allow for the possibility that flat galaxy rotation curves arise , not from the presence of dark matter , but from a possible modification of the law of gravitation on scales larger than the solar system .",
    "notable examples of such modifications include modified newtonian dynamics [ mond ]  @xcite where it is assumed that the gravitational force acting on a test particle of mass @xmath1 is given by the relation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is acceleration in newtonian mechanics and @xmath4 is a new fundamental constant of nature having the value @xmath5 ms@xmath6 . for very small accelerations [ large distances ] it is assumed that @xmath7 whereas @xmath8 approaches the value one for accelerations encountered in the solar neighborhood .    hence for large distances we will have the relation @xmath9 the virtue thus is that @xmath3 falls as @xmath10 rather than @xmath11 . thus equating @xmath3 to the centripetal acceleration",
    "@xmath12 we get that @xmath13 with the numerical choice of @xmath4 made above one gets the desired flat value of the velocity .",
    "another noted example is scalar - tensor - vector gravity [ stvg ] , where a massive vector field with a mass , denoted @xmath8 , interacts with gravity with a coupling strength denoted @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that in stvg , the law of gravitation acquires a yukawa modification , which is given by @xmath15\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a parameter which vanishes when @xmath18 .",
    "it is assumed [ and justified by further considerations ] that one can generalize this to the case of a mass distribution by replacing the factor @xmath19 in ( [ accelerationlaw ] ) by @xmath20 .",
    "the rotational velocity of a star @xmath21 is obtained from @xmath22 and is given by @xmath23\\biggr\\}^{1/2}. \\label{rotvel}\\ ] ]    from observations of galaxies the density profile @xmath24 is known to be @xmath25 \\label{densprof}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27    a good fit to a large number of galaxies has been achieved with the parameters : @xmath28 in the fitting of the galaxy rotation curves for both lsb and hsb galaxies , using photometric data to determine the mass distribution @xmath29 , only the mass - to - light ratio @xmath30 is employed , once the values of @xmath17 and @xmath31 are fixed universally for all lsb and hsb galaxies .",
    "dwarf galaxies are also fitted with the parameters @xmath32",
    "remarkably enough , it can be shown that the modified law of acceleration ( [ accelerationlaw ] ) of stvg , and the consequent velocity profile ( [ rotvel ] ) is also a solution of the following modified fourth order poisson equation  @xcite @xmath33 provided the density profile is chosen as in ( [ densprof ] ) and one identifies @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath17 appears as a constant of integration in the solution of ( [ fog ] ) .",
    "greater insight into the modified acceleration can be had by expanding the acceleration law @xmath35 \\bigg\\ } \\label{yukawa}\\ ] ] around @xmath36 and writing it as a sum of two terms : a part that falls as @xmath11 and is independent of @xmath31 , and a part that falls as @xmath10 and depends on @xmath31 .",
    "this gives    @xmath37- \\frac{gm(r)}{r}\\bigg [ \\sqrt{\\frac{m_0}{m}}\\frac{1}{r_0 e}\\bigg ] .",
    "\\label{accelrationintwoparts}\\ ] ]        the second term dominates for @xmath38 . fig . 1 above plots the rotation velocity curve , and",
    "it is clear that the keplerian fall - off due to conventional newtonian acceleration [ first term ] is modified to a flat rotation curve [ second term ] for @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath10 fall - off brought about by the second term is mond - like behaviour . at even larger distances ,",
    "the second term is exponentially damped and the fall off is again keplerian but with an effectively larger value of @xmath39 .",
    "it is significant that from our work we can give an estimate of the theoretical value of @xmath4 in mond .",
    "a simplistic guess would be to construct a quantity with the dimension of acceleration from our fundamental quantities @xmath40 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is nothing but @xmath41 which is of the same order as @xmath4 in mond .",
    "( @xmath42m / s@xmath43 ) .",
    "the relation is made more transparent by comparing the acceleration given by the second term of eqn .",
    "( [ accelrationintwoparts ] ) with the acceleration in mond in eqn .",
    "( [ mondacceleration ] ) . this comparison yields the fundamental relation @xmath44",
    "the fourth order modified poisson equation considered above is the weak field limit of the following modification of general relativity : @xmath45 it is possible that such an effective modification of einstein gravity comes into play during the late stages of the evolution of the universe , when large scale structures form .",
    "an intriguing alternate possibility , which has been discussed in  @xcite is that the fourth order modification of the poisson equation is a consequence of induced polarization of the gravitational field of a galaxy , caused by neighboring galaxies .",
    "thinking of galaxies as ` molecules ' made of atoms [ the stars ] , one would like to analyze how the averaged gravitational field inside a galaxy , is modified by the polarization of the molecules , due to the external pull of other galaxies .",
    "indeed one has at the back of the mind the polarization induced modification of electromagnetic fields in an electrically charged medium .",
    "it can be shown that as a consequence of polarization , the averaged einstein equations are effectively modified to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the energy - momentum tensor of molecules , and @xmath48 is the quadrupole gravitational polarization tensor .",
    "it is modelled by assuming it be proportional to the weyl tensor , in analogy with the electrostatic case , @xmath49 and the gravitational dielectric constant @xmath50 is modelled by @xcite as @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the typical linear dimension of a molecule , @xmath1 is the typical mass of a molecule , @xmath53 is a typical frequency of harmonically oscillating atoms in the molecule and @xmath54 is the number density of the molecules in the medium . in the weak field limit , eqn .",
    "( [ einstein - molecule ] ) can be shown to go over to the modified poisson equation ( [ fog ] ) with @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the theoretically predicted values of @xmath40 and @xmath17 agree well with the values phenomenologically assumed for fitting data , suggesting that gravitational quadrupole polarization is a contender for explaining flat galaxy rotation curves  @xcite .",
