    "recently interest in extracting the neutron capture cross section by stable nuclei at higher energies through the @xmath6 reaction has arisen in part for application to next generation reactors ( fast breeder reactors fueled by @xmath7u , and @xmath8th ) , and in part for the study of the reaction mechanism of weakly bound stable nuclei .",

    "for this purpose , they employed the theory of inclusive non - elastic breakup reactions , where the proton is treated as a spectator , merely scattering off the target , and the neutron is captured by the target , and , at higher energies , inelastically scattering from the target .",
    "other papers on the @xmath6 reaction were also published in 2015 dealing with the same issue @xcite .",

    "finally the last cross section , @xmath103 , is new and a genuine three - body absorption cross section . in the following",

    "the first term corresponds to the already announced excitation of the target by one fragment followed by a de - excitation through the action of the second fragment .",
    "the last two terms corresponds to absorption of the two fragments by the target .",
    "there are eight terms which describe the different ways this absorption is manifested .",
    "it is evident that a detailed evaluation of @xmath71 is a formidable task .",
    "we venture to hypothesize the following .",
    "the first term above is replaced by a non - local separable term with an energy - dependent `` strength '' such that the exitation - de - excitation term is represented by @xmath111 . if the two fragments are identical , such as the case of two neutrons , then @xmath112 .",
    "the second and third term , the `` capture '' part , is replaced by a single term which involves the reaction / fusion of two correlated fragments .",
    "the correlation is induced by the interaction @xmath64 , which besides scattering the two fragments , could bind them in a resonance or quasi - bound state .",
