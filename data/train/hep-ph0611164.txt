    "it is known that the evident differences between quarks and leptons may be no more than the low energy manifestation of a more symmetric underlying theory .",
    "in particular it has been shown that one may construct four dimensional models which are invariant under a discrete quark - lepton ( ql ) symmetry , whereby one interchanges all quarks and leptons in the lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "this idea requires the introduction of leptonic colour , an @xmath4 gauge group acting on a set of generalised leptons , and thus predicts new gauge bosons and fermions .    recently",

    "the extra dimension was assumed to form an @xmath0 orbifold , the construction of which reduced the five dimensional ql symmetric gauge group to one of its subgroups .",
    "the model required an order @xmath5  gev cut - off to suppress the proton decay rate and the extra dimension was taken to be of order @xmath6  gev .    in the present work we construct a complete five dimensional ql symmetric model , with all fields assumed to propagate in a five dimensional spacetime .",
    "placing fermions in the bulk provides new ways of addressing the problems encountered in the previous construct .",

    "a common problem encountered in ql symmetric models is the presence of tree level mass relations of the type @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the higher dimensional framework provides a new way to understand the absence of such mass relations .",
    "the mass relations may be removed from the effective four dimensional theory if zero mode fermions corresponding to sm quarks and leptons have different profiles along the extra dimension . in our model",
    "this occurs as follows .",
    "all zero mode fermions corresponding to sm quarks are localised at one orbifold fixed point , with the varying widths of the fifth dimensional quark wavefunctions determining the degree of wavefunction overlap between left- and right - chiral sm quarks .",
    "this in turn determines the size of the effective four dimensional quark yukawa couplings with the sm higgs scalar .",
    "leptons are localised at the opposite end of the extra dimension , with @xmath8 doublet leptons localised at the fixed point and right - chiral neutrinos and charged leptons shifted slightly into the bulk .",
    "thus the fifth dimensional wavefunction overlaps in the lepton sector tend to be reduced relative to that of the quark sector , motivating the flavour differences observed between quarks and leptons . by shifting the right - chiral neutrinos further into the bulk than the right - chiral charged leptons",

    "the flavour changing neutral current bounds which arise in the lepton sector are much weaker and permit the extra dimension to be relatively large .",

    "note that the interplay of the @xmath267 factor in the numerator of ( [ goldman_bound ] ) and the @xmath268 dependence of @xmath269 renders the rate for @xmath257 independent of @xmath190 .",
    "we expect the @xmath238 kk lipton to be the lightest state to contribute significantly to the decay @xmath257 .",
    "the @xmath234 state is not localised at the same fixed point as the @xmath270 chiral modes  @xcite and thus its contribution to the decay will be suppressed by the @xmath266 factor .    the factors @xmath271 and @xmath272 in equation ( [ goldman_replacement_k_1_2_g_y ] ) represent the wave function overlap between @xmath270 chiral mode neutrinos , the @xmath238 lipton which couples to this neutrino and the @xmath234 @xmath15 gauge boson .",

    "the dirac mass coupling the @xmath238 liptons is expected to be larger than the associated @xmath270 mode dirac mass @xmath219 as the 5d wavefunctions for the higher kk modes generally have broader wavefunctions in the extra dimension than the zero modes .",

    "as mentioned already , the neutrino @xmath187 may also decay via emission of an @xmath120 glueball in ql symmetric models . before concluding that cosmological considerations demand @xmath299  gev we must further investigate this decay mode .",
    "the interaction eigenstate right - chiral neutrino is an @xmath300 singlet and as such does nt couple directly to the @xmath300 gluons ( henceforth referred to as ` stickons ' , adopting the notation of  @xcite ) .",

    "stickon exchange leads to bound state fermions formed by the liptons and the @xmath15 bosons . interestingly",
    "these bound state fermions possess the same quantum numbers as the sm leptons  @xcite .",
    "consequently they mix with the known leptons and the resulting physical leptons contain small admixtures of states which couple to the stickons .    of importance to us",
    "is the mixing of @xmath187 with the sm singlet bound state fermions ( henceforth bound state neutrinos ) .",
    "it has been shown that the neutrino - bound state neutrino mixing leads to heavy neutrino decays of the type @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is an @xmath300 glueball ( henceforth a stickball ) .",
    "the stickballs have a mass set by the @xmath300 strong interaction scale @xmath303 , which has been estimated in  @xcite to be of order 10  mev .",
    "the lightest stickball is expected to be a lorentz scalar @xmath304 and the neutrino @xmath187 may decay by emitting a real stickball if @xmath305 .",
    "if @xmath306 the stickball must be virtual and the decay mode is @xmath307 .",
    "the mixing between @xmath187 and the bound state neutrinos was quantified in  @xcite in terms of two mixing angles @xmath308 .",
    "it was found that a maximal value of @xmath309 is expected for 4d ql models .",
    "the rate for @xmath310 then depends on @xmath311 .    in the 5d theory",
    "additional factors arise . again , because @xmath15 boson exchange only couples @xmath187 to @xmath235 kk mode liptons a factor of @xmath312 must be included .",
    "also the study of  @xcite assumed dirac neutrinos .",
    "we have majorana neutrinos and the decay rate for stickball emission will depend on the mixing between @xmath204 and @xmath122 , which takes the standard seesaw form of @xmath313 in our model . putting this together we find that the replacement @xmath314 is required to utilise the results of the 4d study .",
    "in  @xcite it was found that the lifetime for a 17  kev neutrino to decay by stickball emission could be @xmath315 . employing the replacement ( [ bulk_ql_glueball_decay_replacement ] )",
    "one finds that the lifetime for stickball emission is @xmath316 for a heavy neutrino with mass @xmath282  mev in the 5d model .",
    "the lifetime is inversely proportional to @xmath216 so that larger mass values decrease the lifetime .",
    "however the dominant decay mode will be @xmath317 for @xmath318  mev , so that the bound of @xmath299  gev still applies .",
    "interestingly both the stickball and photon decay modes for @xmath187 depend on the dirac mass coupling @xmath204 and @xmath187 . for @xmath319",
    "these decays do not occur and @xmath187 becomes stable .",
    "in this limit it is important to ensure that the density of @xmath187 particles which remain at the freeze out temperature of @xmath320 does not overclose the universe .",
    "this leads to the well known lee - weinberg bound of @xmath321  gev for a massive majorana neutrino .",
    "this is much weaker than the bound obtained when considering the radiative decay . in the present model the limit @xmath319 corresponds to the limit in which @xmath187 is localised at the opposite boundary to @xmath204 .",
    "we note that this limit does not lead to rapid proton decays of the type @xmath322 as kinematic considerations of any neutrino which satisfies the lee - weinberg bound will preclude proton decay via this channel . given that this is the lowest bound on the mass of @xmath187 we will consider this scenario in what remains .",
    "this setup has the added advantage of allowing for an improved understanding of the hierarchy between quark and lepton masses in a ql symmetric framework , a matter which is currently under investigation  @xcite .",
    "having obtained the lower bound on the mass of @xmath187 in the preceding section we may now consider the bounds on the remaining scales in the theory .",
    "the ql symmetry breaking scale must satisfy the bound @xmath323  tev , due to leptonic annihilations involving the @xmath86 bosons . if we take @xmath324  tev in accordance with the lower bound obtained by considering kk contributions to fcncs , then the lower bound on @xmath216 and the upper bound of 1  ev on @xmath325 translate into lower bounds on @xmath87 and @xmath126 . using ( [ bulk_ql_sm_neutrin_mass ] ) and ( [ bulk_ql_sterile_nu_mass ] )",
    "gives : @xmath326 so that the lower bound on @xmath216 translates into the bounds @xmath327 for @xmath324  tev .",
    "furthermore the demand that the proton does not decay too rapidly translates into a bound on @xmath190 , which we find to be @xmath328  tev .",
    "this enables us to summarise the mass scales for the exotic fields in our construction and some of the associated phenomenology .    with @xmath324  tev and @xmath329 in accordance with the lower bounds , we find the zero mode @xmath86 boson mass to be @xmath330  tev .",

    "although they do not couple directly to leptons via @xmath15 boson exchange they will couple with the known fermions through electroweak interactions and through @xmath86 exchange .",
    "thus the @xmath270 liptons may appear at the lhc via interactions of the type @xmath334 etc",
    ". a key signature for this construct would be the appearance of liptons at the lhc .",
    "one could then discriminate this model from other ql symmetric models by studying the coupling of the liptons to leptons at the proposed ilc .",
    "the liptons of this model do not couple to leptons via @xmath15 boson exchange and thus only electroweak and @xmath86 interactions would couple @xmath335 pairs to the liptons .",
    "we remind the reader that the unbroken @xmath300 symmetry confines liptons into two particle bound states . having the lightest liptons in different @xmath12 multiplets to the sm leptons does not alter the stability of the lightest lipton bound states .",
    "these decay via the electromagnetic or weak interactions . as the electroweak bosons have uniform profiles in the fifth dimension their couplings to the liptons",
    "are the same as the 4d case .",
    "thus the lifetimes of the lightest confined liptons are the same as the 4d case and these bound states present no cosmological concern .",
    "the liptons which do couple to the sm leptons are @xmath235 members of kk towers .",
    "these states possess mass of order @xmath336  tev .",
    "their couplings to sm leptons via @xmath15 exchange are highly suppressed due to the localisation methods employed in this work , thus the associated phenomenology ( like the rare decay @xmath228 ) is also suppressed .",

    ". the @xmath15 bosons also appear at this scale , though at these energies they will only manifest themselves in precision experiments through couplings to the other gauge bosons .",
    "we have constructed a complete five dimensional ql symmetric model .",
    "this model differs from a previous five dimensional ql symmetric model  @xcite in that all fermions are assumed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "placing fermions in the bulk provides the following advantages advantages over the earlier framework .",
    "namely : + @xmath338 the longevity of the proton is readily understood by localising quarks and leptons at ( or near ) different fixed points in the extra dimension .",

    "+ @xmath338 the higher dimensional framework allows one to understand the absence of mass relations of the type @xmath1 or @xmath2 in a ql symmetric framework due to the different profiles of quark and lepton wavefunctions in the extra dimension .",
    "+ @xmath338 the five dimensional model permits a purely higher dimensional mechanism whereby one may suppress the neutrino mass scale relative to the electroweak scale by spatially separating left- and right - chiral neutrino fields .    the bounds on the mass of @xmath187 depend on its localisation point .",
    "we find that @xmath248  gev is required if @xmath187 is localised near @xmath204 , whilst @xmath187 can be of order gev if it is localised at the ` quark end ' of the extra dimension .",
    "the model as it stands has some features which are introduced in a somewhat arbitrary fashion and it would be pleasing to uncover deeper reasons for their implementation . in particular it would be satisfying to understand why the five dimensional fermion @xmath339 couples more strongly to the bulk scalar @xmath149 than do @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "it would also be pleasing to discover a connection between the fermions that undergo @xmath4 symmetry breaking and the fermions which couple with opposite sign yukawa coupling constants to the bulk scalars @xmath149 and @xmath178 . in four dimensional ql symmetric models",

    "<S> we construct a complete five dimensional quark - lepton symmetric model , with all fields propagating in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the extra dimension forms an @xmath0 orbifold with the zero mode fermions corresponding to standard model quarks localised at one fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> zero modes corresponding to left(right)-chiral leptons are localised at ( near ) the other fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> this localisation pattern is motivated by the symmetries of the model . </S>",
    "<S> shifting the right - handed neutrinos and charged leptons slightly from the fixed point provides a new mechanism for understanding the absence of relations of the type @xmath1 or @xmath2 in quark - lepton symmetric models . </S>",
    "<S> flavour changing neutral currents resulting from kaluza klein gluon exchange , which typically arise in the quark sector of split fermion models , are suppressed due to the localisation of quarks at one point . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of quarks and leptons in the compact extra dimension also acts to suppress the proton decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> this permits the extra dimension to be much larger than that obtained in a previous construct , with the bound @xmath3  tev obtained . </S>"
