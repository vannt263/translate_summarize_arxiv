    "more than four decades ago grigori n.  milstein proposed a new numerical method for the approximate integration of stochastic ordinary differential equations ( sodes ) in @xcite ( see @xcite for an english translation ) .",
    "this scheme is nowadays called the _ milstein method _ and offers a higher order of accuracy than the classical euler - maruyama scheme .",
    "in fact , g.  n.  milstein showed that his method converges with order @xmath0 to the exact solution with respect to the root mean square norm under suitable conditions on the coefficient functions of the sode while the euler - maruyama scheme is only convergent of order @xmath1 , in general .    in its simplest form ,",
    "that is for scalar stochastic differential equations driven by a scalar wiener process @xmath2 , the milstein method is given by the recursion @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the step size , @xmath5 is the stochastic increment , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the drift and diffusion coefficient functions of the underlying sode ( equation below shows the sode in the full generality considered in this paper ) .    since the derivation of the milstein method in @xcite relies on an iterated application of the it formula , the error analysis requires the boundedness and continuity of the coefficient functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their partial derivatives up to the fourth order .",
    "similar conditions also appear in the standard literature on this topic @xcite .    in more recent publications these conditions",
    "have been relaxed : for instance in @xcite it is proved that the strong order @xmath0 result for the scheme stays true if the coefficient functions are only two times continuously differentiable with bounded partial derivatives , provided the exact solution has sufficiently high moments and the mapping @xmath8 is globally lipschitz continuous for every @xmath9 $ ] . on the other hand , from the results in @xcite",
    "it follows that the explicit euler - maruyama method is divergent in the strong and weak sense if the coefficient functions are super - linearly growing . since the same reasoning also applies to the milstein scheme it is necessary to consider suitable variants in this situation .",
    "one possibility to treat super - linearly growing coefficient functions is proposed in @xcite . here",
    "the authors combine the milstein scheme with the taming strategy from @xcite .",
    "this allows to prove the strong convergence rate @xmath0 in the case of sodes whose drift coefficient functions satisfy a one - sided lipschitz condition .",
    "the same approach is used in @xcite , where the authors consider sodes driven by lvy noise . however",
    ", both papers still require that the diffusion coefficient functions are globally lipschitz continuous .",
    "this is not needed for the implicit variant of the milstein scheme considered in @xcite , where the strong convergence result also applies to certain sodes with super - linearly growing diffusion coefficient functions .",
    "however , the authors only consider scalar sodes and did not determine the order of convergence .",
    "the first result bypassing all these restrictions is found in @xcite , which deals with an explicit first order method based on a variant of the taming idea . a more recent result based on the taming strategy",
    "is also given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we propose two further variants of the milstein scheme which apply to multi - dimensional sodes of the form .",
    "first , we follow an idea from @xcite and study the _ projected milstein method _ which consists of the standard explicit milstein scheme together with a nonlinear projection onto a sphere whose radius is expanding with a negative power of the step size . the second scheme is a milstein - type variant of the split - step backward euler scheme ( see @xcite ) termed _ split - step backward milstein method_.    for both schemes we prove the optimal strong convergence rate @xmath0 in the following sense : let @xmath10 \\times \\omega \\to { { \\mathbb{r}}}^d$ ] and @xmath11 denote the exact solution and its numerical approximation with corresponding step size @xmath4 .",
    "then , there exists a constant @xmath12 independent of @xmath4 such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "for the proof we essentially impose the global monotonicity condition and certain local lipschitz assumptions on the first order derivatives of the drift and diffusion coefficient functions .",
    "for a precise statement of all our assumptions and the two convergence results we refer to assumption  [ as : fg ] and theorems  [ th : pmilconv ] and [ cor : ssbmconv ] below .",
    "together with the result on the balanced scheme found in @xcite , these theorems are the first results which determine the optimal strong convergence rate for some milstein - type schemes without any linear growth or global lipschitz assumption on the diffusion coefficient functions and for multi - dimensional sodes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : prob ] we introduce the projected milstein method and the split - step backward milstein scheme in full detail .",
    "we state all assumptions and the convergence results , which are then proved in later sections .",
    "further , we apply the convergence results to sodes with additive noise for which the milstein - type schemes coincide with the corresponding euler - type scheme .",
    "the proofs follow the same steps as the error analysis in @xcite . in order to keep this paper as",
    "self - contained as possible we briefly recall the notions of c - stability and b - consistency and the abstract convergence theorem from @xcite in section  [ sec : def ] .",
    "then , in the following four sections we verify that the two considered milstein - type schemes are indeed stable and consistent in the sense of section  [ sec : def ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : exp ] we report on a couple of numerical experiments which illustrate our theoretical findings .",
    "note that both examples include non - globally lipschitz continuous coefficient functions , which are not covered by the standard results found in @xcite .",
    "this section contains a detailed description of our assumptions on the stochastic differential equation , under which our strong convergence results hold .",
    "further , we introduce the projected milstein method and the split - step backward milstein scheme and we state our main results .",
