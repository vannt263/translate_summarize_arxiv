    "in the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 denotes a vector meson ) decays , polarizations of the two vector mesons have been extensively studied by experiments .",
    "the decay amplitude for the b meson to two vector mesons can be decomposed into three parts . in the transversity basis",
    "they are longitudinal @xmath7 and two transverse modes , where the latter consist of the parallel @xmath8 and the perpendicular @xmath9 . in terms of them",
    "we can define the polarization fractions as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "we take the normalization : @xmath13 .",
    "the naive factorization estimation yields @xmath14 .",
    "however , in the penguin dominated @xmath15 decays it is not the case .",
    "for example , the polarization fractions in @xmath16 decays are @xcite @xmath17 these results are very different from the naive expectations .",
    "such discrepancy between the theory and experiments in the @xmath15 decays is referred as `` the polarization puzzle ( anomaly ) '' .",
    "one possibility of resolving the puzzle is to resort to the new physics ( np ) . in @xcite",
    "it is pointed out that tensor operators may play an essential role of helicity flipping of the quarks .",
    "one of the resolutions within the standard model ( sm ) framework is to take into account the large weak - annihilation effect @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author pointed out that the magnitude of annihilation correction is order of @xmath18 , and the effect can interfere with the longitudinal and transverse modes destructively and constructively , respectively .",
    "it is noted , however , that the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) yields @xmath19 even with annihilation effects @xcite . in this presentation , we take into account @xmath20 and @xmath1 data to further constrain the possible np contributions .",
    "in @xcite , @xmath21 np operators @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) are introduced to resolve the polarization puzzle .",
    "these operators are not independent and can be related with each other through the following fierz transformations : @xmath24    in the naive factorization , the @xmath15 decay amplitudes are sensitive to tensor operators but insensitive to scalar ones . on the other hand , for @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is a pseudo - scalar meson ) decay amplitudes it is the other way around .    in the mssm ,",
    "scalar operators are induced by the neutral - higgs penguin diagrams @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 we find that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not independent and constrained by @xmath31 ( see fig .  [ abratio ] ) .     for various @xmath32 and @xmath33",

    "decays the np effects modify the wilson coefficients @xmath39 , where @xmath40 the contributions of the np tensor operators to the decay amplitudes in the transversity basis are given by @xmath41 [ h_2 t_2(m_\\phi^2)-h_3 t_3(m_\\phi^2 ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ \\overline{a}_{\\parallel}^{np } & = & 4 i \\sqrt{2 } f_\\phi^t m_b^2   [ \\tilde{a}_{23 } - \\tilde{a}_{25 } ] f_2 t_2(m_\\phi^2 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\overline{a}_{\\perp}^{np } & = & 4 i \\sqrt{2 } f_\\phi^t m_b^2   [ \\tilde{a}_{23 } + \\tilde{a}_{25 } ] f_1 t_1(m_\\phi^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42    in the @xmath43 fit , we have used 20 observables from @xmath44 and @xmath45 data , and 7 observables from @xmath46 . as for np fitting parameters we use @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "for simplicity we consider the two np scenarios : ( a ) np - scenario where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and ( b ) np scenario where @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "we include the annihilation contributions in the decay amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we take the annihilation effects into account and perform @xmath43 fitting .",

    "[ contour ] the bound is indicated as the small circle at the origin . since in both scenarios",
    "the @xmath67 data and the sm are located within contours where @xmath68 is sufficiently small , we thus conclude that the new - physics effects due to the scalar operators may be negligible .",
    "finally we make a remark on the recently observed large polarization fraction @xmath69 for @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "if tensor operators play an significant role in @xmath71 ( @xmath72 denotes a tensor meson ) decays , @xmath69 may significantly deviate from unity .",
    "the current experiment is consistent with our result since in our analysis the tensor operator are found to be tiny .",
    "however , in the present study we can not exclude the possibility that sizable np effects contribute directly to tensor operators , instead of scalar / pseudoscalar operators , and , moreover , a cancellation may take place between weak annihilation and contributions due to np tensor operators in the @xmath73 decay .",
    "for the point of view of the new physics , @xmath73 may be sensitive to the @xmath74 tensor form factor which can be further explored from the @xmath75 decay .",
