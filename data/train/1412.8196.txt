    "now , assume that exponents of @xmath80 take the form @xmath91 .",

    "the leaves belonging to this set are ruled surfaces parametrized by a painlev transcendent .",
    "one should recover the lam case of section [ secknownconstructions ] by restricting the isomonodromic foliation to the locus @xmath99 .",
