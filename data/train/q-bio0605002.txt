    "in contrast to methods based on ( automated ) alignments , alignment - free methods make fewer assumptions about the nature of the sequences they work on , and so far are mostly devoid of any evolutionary model of sequence change ( the only exception being the w - metric by ) .",
    "the absence of an assumption of collinearity over long stretches ( implicit in any alignment ) destines them to be especially useful for handling dna sequences that have undergone recombination , proteins with shuffled domains , and genomic sequences ( which often feature large - scale rearrangements ) .",

    "the phylogenetic accuracy of these methods is comparatively evaluated on synthetic and empirical data , covering a wide range of phylogenetic distances , and we assess whether differences are statistically significant in section  [ comparison ] before presenting conclusions .",
    "in this section , we provide a summary of previously established alignment - free methods .",

    "both the application of pattern discovery , and distance estimation by ml , represent novel steps in this context .",
    "we infer pairwise distances from the sequence data covered by patterns , yielding a distance matrix .",

    "we briefly introduce some basic terminology for teiresias ; for more details , including a description of the algorithm , the reader is referred to @xcite .",

    "call @xmath58 maximal with respect toa sequence set @xmath66 if making @xmath58 more specific reduces its total support ( irrespective of the number of sequences ) .",
    "we are now ready to state the behaviour of the algorithm : teiresiasfinds all maximal @xmath60patterns ( with support @xmath67 ) in a set @xmath66 of unaligned sequences .",
    "the pairwise distance @xmath68 between two sequences @xmath69 and @xmath70 is computed as follows : first , we filter out patterns that occur more than once in any sequence .",
    "this removes false positives and ensures that the self - distance of any sequence is zero .",
    "second , all instances of patterns occurring simultaneously in ( at least ) @xmath69 and @xmath70 are concatenated , resulting in two new sequences @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the same length . note that a pattern may occur in three or more sequences , in which case we project it on multiple pairs of sequences .",
    "also note that generally @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 ) will differ in length from @xmath73 ( and @xmath74 ) because the patterns occurring simultaneously in ( at least ) @xmath69 and @xmath70 will differ in number ( and number of residues they cover ) from those appearing in @xmath75 and @xmath70 .",
    "third , these new , concatenated sequences are used to estimate pairwise distances .",
    "this is done by applying a maximum likelihood - based approach that optimizes with respect toa model of amino acid evolution . for the purpose of this work we use the jtt model @xcite as implemented in protdistfrom the phylippackage @xcite .",
    "note that the algorithm for calculating distances from patterns is general .",
    "our means for pattern discovery is teiresias , but , in principle at least , other tools could also be used . to retain the alignment - free property of our approach , any replacement needs to have that property as well .      our rationale for parameterizing teiresiaswith @xmath76 , @xmath77 is as follows .",
    "consider ordinary @xmath5-mers : higher values for @xmath5 reduce chance occurrences among a set of sequences , thus reducing false positives .",
    "we observe that teiresiaspatterns and @xmath5-mersbear a relationship ; to this end we introduce _ elementary patterns _ : an elementary pattern is a @xmath60pattern with exactly @xmath52 residues .",
    "teiresiasdiscovers maximal @xmath60patterns using elementary patterns as building blocks during its convolution phase @xcite . for the special case @xmath78 (",
    "no wildcard characters are allowed ) , we find that setting @xmath79 leads to elementary patterns capturing a subset of all @xmath5-mers .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath80 for @xmath5-mers(a @xmath5-mermay occur only once ) whereas we use @xmath81 for teiresias(a pattern must occur in at least two sequences ) .",
    "thus we see that higher values for @xmath52 reduce the number of false positives . for our distance calculation , however , we need patterns capable of accounting for differences between sequences , hence we require @xmath82 . in preliminary experiments on data described in section  [ empirical ] , we tried several higher values for @xmath52 with @xmath82 first .",
    "we found for @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( a ratio of @xmath83 ) , the values that we use throughout section  [ comparison ] , all pairwise distances are defined , i.e.every pair of sequences is covered by at least one instance of a pattern . for @xmath84 , corresponding to a ratio of @xmath85 , and higher values of @xmath86 , approaching the ratio @xmath83 , the number of undefined distances is 229 , 127 , 63 , 32 , 23 , 8 , 5 , and 2 out of 8667 .",
    "( on data from section  [ synthetic ] , all distances are defined for @xmath84 . )",
    "undefined distances point towards a problem : some sequence pairs are too divergent  no pair of substrings can be described by ( elementary ) @xmath60patterns .",
    "the ratio @xmath87 determines the minimum similarity any subpattern must possess : it effectively specifies a local similarity threshold .",
    "thus , undefined distances mean that no pair of substrings reach or exceed this threshold .",
    "our solution to the problem is to make sequences more similar by encoding them in a reduced alphabet . following and earlier work by ,",
    "we choose a reduction based on chemical equivalences : [ ag ] , [ de ] , [ fy ] , [ kr ] , [ ilmv ] , [ qn ] , [ st ] , [ bzx ] where [  ] groups similar amino acids together , and unlisted amino acids form classes of their own .",
    "the phylogenetic distance calculation is based on the original sequence data covered by the resulting patterns ; this usually improves phylogenetic accuracy ( see section  [ synthetic - accuracy ] and  [ empirical - accuracy ] ) . as a result of encoding sequences ,",
    "all pairwise distances for e.g.@xmath76 , @xmath84 are defined .",
    "we also find that for sufficiently small values of @xmath52 , the phylogenetic accuracy is virtually independent of the particular choice of @xmath52 , and largely depends on the ratio @xmath87 ( data not shown ) .",
    "generally , the accuracy of tree reconstruction improves as the local similarity threshold is lowered , with diminishing improvement and higher computational costs the further it is lowered .",
    "one property of teiresiasis that each residue can ( and given our parametrization , usually will ) participate in multiple patterns .",
    "this may lead to situations where a particular residue in one sequence pairs with two or more different residues in a second sequence .",
    "it is not clear how this should be interpreted with respect tohomology .",
    "we propose a variant , @xmath88 that resolves this conflict by way of ( relative ) majority consensus and consistency .",
    "we discover patterns as before but introduce an intermediate step before distance estimation .",
    "we record paired positions across all patterns . for any two sequences @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we take positions @xmath89 if and only if a ) @xmath90 is paired with @xmath91 more often than with any other position in @xmath70 , b ) @xmath92 is paired with @xmath93 more often than with any other position in @xmath69 , and c ) @xmath94 and @xmath95 , i.e.the positions are the same . this ensures that every residue participates at most once for a given sequence pair in the distance calculation step . for parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 ,",
    "the constraints prove to be stringent and discard most of the data .",
    "we use a birth - death process to model cladogenesis @xcite and sample from several tree distributions .",
    "the effects of different taxon sampling strategies are described in @xcite .",
    "trees resulting from a birth - death process are rooted , bifurcating and ultrametric ; we deviate them from ultrametricity by an additive process to keep the expectation of the phylogenetic distances unchanged .",

    "( where possible , we parameterized alignment - free methods with the jtt model , or its equilibrium frequencies . )    to compare alignment - free methods with alignment - based methods when the assumption of collinearity is violated , we constructed an additional dataset with a wide distribution of phylogenetic distances .",
