    "the mgii @xmath0 doublets are among the absorption features commonly seen in the spectra of distant quasars that are produced by intervening gaseous clouds along the quasar lines of sight .",
    "their rest - frame absorption equivalent width @xmath9 , ranging from @xmath10   to @xmath11   ( e.g.  steidel & sargent 1990 ; nestor @xmath12  2005 ; prochter @xmath12  2006a ) , is found to represent the underlying gas kinematics ( e.g.  petitjean & bergeron 1990 ; churchill @xmath12  2000 ) .",
    "based on comparisons of the abundance ratios of various associated ions , these mgii absorption transitions are understood to arise primarily in photo - ionized gas of temperature @xmath13 k ( bergeron & stasnska 1986 ; hamann 1997 ) and neutral hydrogen column density @xmath14 ( churchill @xmath12  2000 ; rao @xmath12  2006 ) . in addition , surveys for galaxies near the observed mgii absorbers have often uncovered luminous galaxies at projected distances ( @xmath15 kpc ) and velocity separations ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) from the absorbers ( bergeron 1986 ; lanzetta & bowen 1990 , 1992 ; steidel @xmath12  1994 ; zibetti @xmath12  2005 ; nestor @xmath12  2007 ; kacprzak @xmath12  2007 ) .",
    "the relatively large associated @xmath18 and the small separation between mgii absorbers and galaxies along common lines of sight indicate that mgii absorbers may offer a sensitive probe of photo - ionized halo gas around galaxies at redshifts from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in the optical spectral window .",
    "understanding the physical origin of these mgii absorbers bears significantly on all efforts to apply their known statistical properties for constraining the baryon content of dark matter halos on different mass scales ( tinker & chen 2008 ) .",
    "various theoretical models have been developed in the past that describe the nature of the absorbers in the context of gas accretion , including ram pressure stripped gas from accreted satellites ( wang 1993 ) , gravitationally bound cold gas in halo substructures ( e.g. , sternberg @xmath12  2002 ) , and condensed cold clouds in a thermally unstable hot halo ( mo & miralda - escude 1996 ; maller & bullock 2004 ; chelouche @xmath12  2007 ) .",
    "insights to the origin of mgii absorbers can be obtained from their clustering amplitude on large scales ( @xmath21 mpc ) .",
    "the clustering of the absorbers is a consequence of dark matter halos in which they are found .",
    "measurements of the galaxy and absorber cross  correlation function offer a means of quantifying the mean halo mass of the absorbers .",
    "high - mass halos are expected to be highly clustered , while low mass halos on average have weaker clustering strength .",
    "the cross ",
    "correlation function of mgii absorbers and luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) have been measured at @xmath22 by bouch @xmath12  ( 2006 ) , who found that mgii absorbers of @xmath23   cluster strongly with lrgs and that weaker absorbers with @xmath24   on average arise in dark matter halos that are 10 times more massive than those of stronger absorbers with @xmath25  .",
    "both the observed clustering amplitude and the inverse correlation between the mean halo mass and absorber strength are difficult to interpret .",
    "for example , the frequency distribution function of mgii absorbers show that there are on average 10 times more @xmath26   absorbers than those of @xmath27   ( e.g.  nestor @xmath122005 ; prochter @xmath12  2006a ) which , when combined with the clustering measurements , implies that the majority of absorbers reside in massive , highly biased halos . at the same time",
    ", we expect that observed mg@xmath28 ions originate primarily in photo - ionized gas of temperature @xmath13 k and the halo gas in massive dark matter halos becomes too hot for abundant mg@xmath28 to survive .    in tinker & chen ( 2008 ;",
    "hereafter tc08 ) , we developed a new technique that adopts the halo occupation framework for understanding the origin of qso absorption - line systems .",
    "specifically , the technique adopts a model density profile for the mg@xmath28 ions in individual dark matter halos .",
    "the `` cold '' baryon content of individual dark matter halos , as probed by the presence of mg@xmath28 , is then constrained through matching the space density and clustering amplitude of dark matter halos with the observed frequency distribution function of mgii absorbers and their clustering amplitude .",
    "our model allows the possibility that a predominant fraction of the gas in massive halos is shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo and becomes too hot to host abundant mgii absorbing clouds . within the hot halo",
    ", we further allow the possibility that some dense , cold clouds may penetrate through as seen in high resolution cosmological simulations ( kravtsov 2003 ) .",
    "the result of this halo occupation analysis is the probability function @xmath29 that characterizes , for each dark matter halo of @xmath30 , the total probability of finding a mgii absorber of equivalent width @xmath31 .",
    "the halo occupation analysis shows that observations , including both the mgii absorber frequency distribution function and their clustering amplitude , demand a rapid transition in the halo gas content at @xmath32 .",
    "below @xmath33 , halos contain predominantly cold gas and therefore contribute significantly to the observed mgii statistics . beyond @xmath33 ,",
    "the cold gas fraction is substantially reduced and presumably the halo gas becomes too hot to maintain a large contribution to mgii absorbers . in order to reproduce the observed overall strong clustering of the absorbers and the inverse correlation between @xmath9 and halo mass @xmath30 , roughly 5% of the gas in halos up to @xmath34  is required to be cold .",
    "it is understood under our model that _",
    "the @xmath9 vs.  @xmath30 inverse correlation arises mainly as a result of an elevated clustering amplitude of @xmath35   absorbers , rather than a suppressed clustering strength of @xmath36   absorbers . _",
    "the clustering amplitude of weak absorbers is elevated because of the presence of cold streams in massive hot halos .",
    "the amount of cold gas in clusters is small , therefore these halos can only contribute to weak absorbers .",
    "the initial results of our halo occupation analysis demonstrate that combining known statistics of dark matter halos with a simple model for their gas content can already reproduce the statistical properties known for mgii absorbers .",
    "it provides a simple prescription for populating baryons in dark matter halos that can be compared directly to results from numerical simulations and offer insights for understanding the physics of gas accretion in halos of all mass scales .",
    "however , some uncertainties remain in the halo occupation analysis .",
    "first , a key parameter that constrains the distribution of mg@xmath28 ions in individual dark matter halos is their incidence rate , @xmath37 , per halo .",
    "it specifies the total probability of detecting an absorber in a halo of mass @xmath30 . in the halo occupation analysis of tc08",
    ", we find that dark matter halos of @xmath38  on average have 100% incidence rate of mg@xmath28 ions , @xmath39 , at @xmath40 for mg@xmath28 ions and @xmath41 at larger radii . corresponds to the radius , within which the enclosed mean density is @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the background density .",
    "it is motivated by estimates of the virial radius both from the spherical collapse model and from @xmath44-body simulations that predict @xmath45 . ] in halos of lower masses , @xmath46 declines sharply .    while a 100% incidence rate shows that every dark matter halo hosts a uniform gaseous halo of mg@xmath28 ions with size @xmath8 , the low @xmath46 is more difficult to interpret because @xmath46 represents a mean value averaged over all halos of mass @xmath30 .",
    "a low @xmath46 may be a result of only a small fraction of dark matter halos containing extended distributions of mg@xmath28 ions or a result of a small covering factor of mg@xmath28 in all halos .",
    "in addition , we have assumed in our initial analysis that the gaseous extent is related to halo mass according to @xmath47^{\\beta}$ ] , and @xmath48 physical kpc and @xmath49 .",
    "this scaling relation follows the theoretical expectation between virial radius and halo mass , but a higher @xmath8 would naturally lower @xmath50 for a fixed frequency distribution function of mgii absorbers .",
    "second , the physical origin of the cold clouds probed by the mgii absorption transitions is ambiguous .",
    "while the mass scale at which halo gas is found to experience a transition from a cold - mode dominated state to a hot - mode dominated state agrees well with the expectation of theoretical models established to characterize the gas accretion history in dark matter halos ( e.g.  birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere @xmath12  2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; birnboim @xmath12  2007 ) , the observed cold - hot transition can also be interpreted as a declining formation efficiency of cool clouds in a hot halo with increasing halo mass ( e.g.  mo & miralda - escude 1996 ; maller & bullock 2004 ) .",
    "both of these scenarios predict that halo gas is primarily cold at @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand , bouch @xmath12  ( 2006 ) have argued that the inverse correlation between @xmath9 and clustering amplitude is suggestive of the absorbers arising in non - virialized gas flows , such as starburst winds .    while dense clumps in starburst driven outflows are expected to contribute to some fraction of the observed mgii absorbers , an important quantity to specify",
    "is the significance of this fraction .",
    "if a large fraction of mgii absorbers originate in cold dense clumps in starburst winds , then one must also account for the more complex star formation physics in efforts to apply known mgii statistics for constraining the gas content of dark matter halos .",
    "we defer to   5.3 for a more detailed discussion of the caveats in interpreting the known properties of mgii absorbers as evidence to support their origin in starburst winds .",
    "direct constraints on the covering fraction of mgii absorbing gas versus halo mass not only help to break the degeneracy between the fraction of dark matter halos containing cold baryons and the extent of cold gas in individual halos , in principle they also serve to discriminate between the starburst wind scenario and gas accretion . under the starburst wind scenario ,",
    "superwind driven outflows are expected to proceed over a finite angular span along the minor axis ( e.g.  heckman @xmath12  1990 ; veilleux @xmath12  2005 ) , and result in only partial covering of the halos .",
    "in addition , because at a given epoch only some fraction of galaxies are found at starburst or post - starburst stages , we would expect a fraction of dark matter halos to contain extended mgii absorbing gas due to outflows .    to obtain empirical constraints on the extent and covering fraction of mg@xmath28 ions around galaxies of different luminosity and mass ,",
    "we have initiated a survey of mgii absorbers around known galaxies at small projected distances ( @xmath52 kpc ) to a background qso .",
    "accounting the presence or absence of mgii absorbers for an unbiased sample of galaxies at different impact parameters yields a statistical estimate of the gas covering fraction around field galaxies .",
    "a detailed comparison between the absorber strength and galaxy properties further constrains the density profile and extent of the gas .",
    "the primary objectives of our study are ( 1 ) to improve the uncertainties of our halo occupation analysis by obtaining empirical measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath53 , and ( 2 ) to examine whether starburst driven outflows are the predominant mechanism for producing the observed mgii absorbers by obtaining an empirical constraint of the gas covering factor @xmath50 . here",
    "we present the initial results of our study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the design of our experiment for constraining the extent and covering fraction of mg@xmath28 ions . in section 3",
    ", we describe the imaging and spectroscopic data available for our experiment . in section 4",
    ", we examine the correlation between mgii absorption strength and galaxy properties , such as the impact parameter and luminosity .",
    "we compare our results with previous studies and discuss the implications of our analysis in section 5 .",
    "we adopt a @xmath54cdm cosmology , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with a dimensionless hubble constant @xmath57 throughout the paper .",
    "accurate estimates of the extent and covering fraction of mg@xmath28 ions around galaxies require an unbiased survey of mgii absorbers in the vicinity of _ known _ galaxies .",
    "nearly all studies published in the literature to date focus on surveys of galaxies that correspond to known mgii absorbers ( e.g.  bergeron 1986 ; lanzetta & bowen 1990 , 1992 ; steidel @xmath12  1994 ; zibetti @xmath12  2007 ; kacprzak @xmath12  2007 ) , with the exception of an on - going study described in tripp & bowen ( 2005 ) . searching for galaxies that give rise to known mgii absorbers bears a large uncertainty due to contamination from galaxies that are correlated with the true absorbing galaxies .",
    "in addition , these surveys based on known presence of mg@xmath28 ions do not yield constraints on the incidence of these ions in galactic halos .",
    "we are conducting a survey of mgii absorbers at the locations of known galaxies close to the line of sight toward a background qso .",
    "we identify galaxies at impact parameters @xmath58 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 is selected to allow identifications of galaxies at impact parameters beyond the size of extended mgii halos , in order to constrain the extent and covering fraction of the gas . at the same time , we require @xmath59 to be small enough in order to minimize the contamination of galaxies that do not give rise to the absorbers but are merely correlated with the absorbing galaxies through clustering .    to estimate the contamination rate of correlated galaxies as a function of projected distance , we adopt the distribution of dark matter halos identified in cosmological simulations as a guide .",
    "we use the @xmath60 output of a @xmath61 co - moving mpc simulation described in tinker @xmath12  ( 2007 ) .",
    "first , we identify for each random line of sight dark matter halos that have @xmath62 and are located at @xmath63 from the sightline . from tc08 , we consider these halos likely to host a mgii absorber along the line of sight .",
    "this is also consistent with the results from the halo occupation distribution models of galaxies found in deep2 and sloan digital sky survey from zheng , coil , & zehavi ( 2007 ; hereafter zcz07 ) .",
    "these authors found that the minimum mass of a dark matter halo that on average hosts a galaxy of @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "next , for each potential mgii absorber , we search for neighboring halos that are at @xmath66 @xmath17  and projected distance less than @xmath67 from the absorber and may therefore contaminate the search of the true absorber . finally , we repeat this exercise over 10,000 random lines of sight and calculate the frequency of finding contaminating halos as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath17  and at projected distances less than @xmath67 from an absorber .",
    "the errorbars represent the 68% scatter that was estimated using a jackknife resampling technique . ]    the result of our exercise is presented in figure 1 , where we show the probability of contamination due to correlated galaxies versus impact parameter .",
    "the errorbars represent the 68% scatter of the mean from 16 jackknife subsamples .",
    "figure 1 shows that at @xmath68 physical kpc there is a @xmath69 30% chance that one would mis - identify a correlated galaxy as the true absorber . combining the contamination rate estimates with previous search reports that indicate a mean gaseous extent of @xmath70 physical kpc for luminous galaxies ( bergeron 1986 ; lanzetta & bowen 1990 , 1992 ; steidel @xmath12  1994 ) , we carry out our study based on a sample of galaxies that are within @xmath71 kpc from a background qso .",
    "to study the extent and covering fraction of mg@xmath28 ions in galactic halos , it requires survey data of both galaxies and absorbers along common lines of sight toward background quasars .",
    "we have selected seven qso fields for which galaxies data are already available , and echelle spectra of the background qsos have also been obtained either from our own observations or through the eso science data archive .",

    "the fraction of mgii absorbers originating in starburst outflows is therefore expected to be small at @xmath417 , unless starburst outflows are a common feature in field galaxies .",
    "we caution , however , that the same conclusion can not be automatically applied to absorbers at @xmath447 before a similar analysis is performed .",

    "cold clouds that are responsible for producing the absorption features are pressure confined in a hot medium . as the total gas density declines toward larger radii , the density of the cold clouds also decreases and the clouds become optically thin to the ultraviolet photons that can quickly ionize the mg@xmath28 ions ( i.p.@xmath45115.035 ev ) . with a known background radiation field , the location where the ionization transition occurs may be adopted to constrain the density of cold gas at large radii .",

    "taking into account the appropriate photo - ionization condition of the cold clouds , mo & miralda - escud presented the expected mgii and civ absorption strength versus radius for halos of different mass .",
    "their models showed a lack of radial dependence on the civ absorption strength and a tight correlation between mgii @xmath346 and @xmath67 for halos of a wide range of mass .",
    "the differences in the radial dependence of different ions is understood as being due to the photo - ionization condition of cold clouds in the uv background radiation field .",
    "these model expectations agree with observational findings very well .",
    "the agreement between observations and a simple two - phase model is encouraging , although it is not clear how the two - phase model applies to cold - mode halos ( e.g.  dekel & birnboim 2006 ) . measurements of the relative abundances between c@xmath464 and mg@xmath28 as a function of radius will provide additional support for the origin of these metal - line absorbers , further constraining the metallicity and density of halo gas around galaxies .",
    "our initial halo occupation analysis ( tc08 ) included two principal assumptions for the extent of mg@xmath28 .",
    "first , we assumed that the extent of the cold gaseous halo is @xmath465 physical kpc for @xmath466 halos , which is roughly @xmath467 of the halo radius @xmath468 at @xmath469 .",
    "recall that the standard definition of a dark matter halo is an object with a mean interior density of 200 times the background density .",
    "second , the gaseous extent scaled with the halo mass as @xmath470 and @xmath471 , following the expectation of the scaling relation between halo mass and the corresponding virial radius .",
    "the results presented in   4 offer a direct test of these assumptions .    to compare the empirical constraints of equations ( 6 ) & ( 7 ) with our initial model assumptions , we first derive the corresponding dark matter halo mass @xmath30 and their halo radius @xmath468 for galaxies of known absolute @xmath113-band magnitudes .",
    "the adopted @xmath472 for the analysis in ",
    "4 corresponds to a magnitude of @xmath473 in the bandpass of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colless @xmath12  2001 ) . the 2dfgrs probes galaxies at @xmath474 .",
    "excluding galaxies that exist as satellites in a cluster environment % for @xmath320 galaxies ( tinker @xmath12  2007 ; zcz07 ) .",
    "in addition , none of the galaxies in our sample are observed to be part of a larger group or cluster .",
    "here we carry out our calculations , assuming that most of galaxies in our sample are central galaxies in their dark matter halos . ] , the mean halo mass for @xmath472 galaxies is @xmath475 at @xmath474 ( tinker @xmath12  2007 ; van den bosch @xmath12  2007 ) . at @xmath417 , galaxies of this magnitude on average reside in @xmath476 halos ( zcz07 ) .",
    "interpolating in @xmath477 , we find that galaxies of @xmath478 are expected to reside in halos of @xmath479 at @xmath480 and that the halo radius for @xmath472 galaxies is @xmath481 physical kpc",
    ". the best - fit @xmath482 from equation ( 7 ) therefore implies @xmath483 .",
    "next , we derive the expected scaling relation between @xmath8 and halo mass @xmath30",
    ". the halo occupation analysis of 2dfgrs galaxies from tinker @xmath12  ( 2007 ) showed that the relationship between @xmath30 and luminosity for galaxies of @xmath484 at @xmath474 is @xmath485 .",
    "this monotonic relationship is appropriate for galaxies that reside at the _ centers _ of their dark matter halos and are the brightest galaxy in the halo .",
    "a similar scaling relation was obtained from deep2 data by zcz07 for galaxies at @xmath417 . because there is a monotonic relationship between halo mass and galaxy luminosity ,",
    "the scaling relation of @xmath8 with @xmath370 in equation ( 2 ) is equivalent to a scaling relation between @xmath30 and @xmath468 that are related by @xmath486 . adopting @xmath487 from equation ( 6 )",
    ", we derive @xmath488^{0.3}$ ] @xmath489 kpc at @xmath490 .",
    "the calculations above show that observations support the initial assumptions in tc08 that the gaseous radius is a constant fraction of the halo radius for all halos and that the gaseous radius scales with halo mass according to @xmath470 with @xmath491 .",
    "we note that our galaxy sample therefore probes halo mass range from @xmath492 to @xmath493 , and that the best - fit scaling relation is driven by galaxies in the cold - hot transition regime .",
    "next , we compare the observed covering fraction of mgii absorbers with the predicted mean of tc08 .    as summarized in   1 , we find in the halo occupation analysis of tc08 that dark matter halos of @xmath38  on average have a covering fraction of unity @xmath39 at @xmath494 for mg@xmath28 and @xmath41 at larger radii .",
    "this halo mass range corresponds to a luminosity range of @xmath495 at @xmath496 , following the mass - to - light scaling relation discussed above .",
    "sixteen galaxies in our sample have @xmath497 , eleven of which are at @xmath498 .",
    "we identify a corresponding mgii absorber for every one of these galaxies , indicating a mean covering fraction of @xmath499 % at @xmath500 .",
    "this empirical result agrees with our model expectation . to assess the significance of detecting a mgii absorber in every galaxy in the sample of eleven , we adopt the binomial distribution function and find that we can constrain the underlying mean covering factor at @xmath501 with greater than 95% confidence level .",
    "three of the seven remaining @xmath502 galaxies in our sample have @xmath503 .",
    "two of them do not have corresponding mgii absorbers identified to a sensitive upper limit , implying @xmath504 % at @xmath500 for fainter galaxies ( presumably lower - mass halos ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the expectation of tc08 , where we found a quickly declining @xmath376 for halos of @xmath505 , although the observations have a much lower statistical significance .",
    "in addition , we note that there exists an intrinsic scatter in the fiducial scaling relation between @xmath30 and @xmath370 .",
    "this intrinsic scatter is expected to smear out the exact edge of gaseous halos , particularly when considering an ensemble of objects with a wide range of luminosity .    in summary ,",
    "the initial results from the on - going survey of mgii absorbers in the vicinity of known galaxies close to qso lines of sight have allowed us to study in detail the properties of extended gas around galaxies .",
    "the best - fit scaling relation between the extent of mg@xmath28 and galaxy luminosity and the observed mean gas covering fraction together provide strong empirical evidence to support the halo occupation model of tc08 . to improve the statistical significances of various empirical parameters and to obtain a better understanding of the incidence of cold gas in dark matter halos , such as @xmath50 vs.  @xmath30 and @xmath50 vs.  @xmath67 ,",
    "a larger sample of galaxy and mgii absorber pairs established for a wide range of galaxy luminosity and morphology is necessary . in particular ,",
    "only three galaxies in our current sample would be considered in a `` cold - mode '' halo based on their luminosity and none shows a corresponding mgii absorber .",
    "deep surveys targeting at fainter dwarfs are necessary to probe these `` cold - mode '' halos . finally , we encourage observations of mgii absorbers along the lines of sight toward close qso pairs for obtaining a direct measure of the incidence of mg@xmath28 in individual halos .",
