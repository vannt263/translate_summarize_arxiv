    "periodic patterns of euclidean space have been of great important to mathematics , and aesthetics , for centuries .",
    "however , the geometries of periodic patterns are well understood , and there is a rich class of patterns , such as the penrose tilings , which exhibit intricate internal structure without possessing translational symmetry .",
    "aperiodic tilings enjoy connections with areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic @xcite  as established by berger s proof of the undecidability of the domino problem @xcite , diophantine approximation @xcite , the structure of attractors @xcite and symbolic dynamics @xcite , but also to physical applications , most notably to solid state physics in the wake of the discovery of quasicrystals by shechtman et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a full understanding of a periodic tiling , modulo locally defined reversible redecorations , amounts to an understanding of its symmetry group . in the aperiodic",
    "setting , the complexity and incredible diversity of examples demands a multifaceted approach .",
    "techniques from the theory of groupoids @xcite , semigroups @xcite , @xmath0algebras @xcite , dynamical systems @xcite , ergodic theory @xcite and shape theory @xcite find natural rles in the field , and of course these tools have tightly knit connections to each other @xcite .",
    "one approach to studying a given aperiodic tiling @xmath1 is to associate to it a moduli space @xmath2 , sometimes called the tiling space , of locally indistinguishable tilings ; see sadun s",
    "book @xcite for an accessible introduction to the theory .",
    "a central goal is then to formulate methods of computing topological invariants of @xmath2 , and to describe what these invariants actually tell us about the original tiling @xmath1 .",
    "an important perspective , particularly for the latter half of this objective , is provided by kellendonk and putnam s theory of pattern - equivariant ( pe ) cohomology @xcite .",
    "the pe cohomology groups allow for an intuitive geometric description of the ech cohomology @xmath3 of the tiling space . over @xmath4 coefficients the pe cochain groups",
    "may be defined using pe differential forms @xcite , and over general abelian coefficients , when the tiling has a cellular structure , with pe cellular cochains @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the _ pattern - equivariant homology groups _ of a tiling .",
    "the pe chain complex is essentially defined by replacing the cellular coboundary maps of the pe cellular cochain complex with the cellular boundary maps .",
    "so the elements of the pe chain groups are based on infinite cellular chains ( sometimes called borel",
    " moore chains ) which respect the internal symmetries of the pattern .",
    "although the pe homology groups may be defined using singular chains without reference to a specific cellular structure for the underlying pattern @xcite , in this exposition we shall avoid the singular theory and work exclusively with cellular chains .",
    "we review the combinatorial theory of regular cw complexes in  [ sec : preliminaries ] , which one may think of as a generalisation of the theory of abstract simplicial complexes .",
    "this allows us , in ",
    "[ sec : sis ] , to introduce the notion of a _ system of internal symmetries _",
    "( _ sis _ , for short ) over a regular cw complex .",
    "constructions such as the pe cochain complex or the inverse limit of approximants associated to a cellular tiling extend to these objects .",
    "the setting applies naturally to euclidean as well as non - euclidean examples , such as hyperbolic tilings or bowers and stephenson s conformal tilings @xcite , and even to more abstract examples not canonically described by the internal symmetries of a geometric tiling of space , such as those associated to solenoids ( see example [ ex : dyadic ] and  [ solenoid ] ) . whilst sis s",
    "are introduced primarily as a convenient notational tool in which to frame our arguments , we believe that the notion should be of particular use in defining invariants for tilings in the presence of non - trivial isotropy .    in  [ sec : pe ( co)homology ] we define the pe homology and cohomology groups of an sis , and show their invariance under barycentric subdivision .",
    "we then relate the two through the following poincar duality result :    * theorem [ thm : pepd ] * _ let @xmath5 be an sis defined over an oriented homology @xmath6manifold .",
    "if the internal symmetries of @xmath5 are orientation preserving then we have pe poincar duality @xmath7 over divisible coefficients .",
    "moreoever , if @xmath5 has trivial local isotropy , then we have pe poincar duality @xmath8 over general abelian coefficients . _    for example , we have poincar duality between the ech cohomology of the translational hull of an flc tiling @xmath1 of @xmath9 and the pe homology of @xmath1 with respect to translations .",
    "so the pe homology groups provide highly geometric descriptions of pre - established topological invariants associated to aperiodic tilings ; see , for example , figure [ fig : penrose ] .",
    "when one wishes to incorporate rotational symmetries , so that @xmath5 may possess non - trivial local isotropy , the pe poincar duality of theorem [ thm : pepd ] generally fails over non - divisible coefficients and the pe homology provides a new invariant .",
    "the pe homology often picks up extra torsion elements to the pe cohomology .",
    "although we demonstrate in  [ subsec : mod ] how one may modify the pe homology groups so as to regain duality , we consider this extra torsion as a phenomenon of potential interest . indeed , in forthcoming work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we will show how this extra torsion may be incorporated into a spectral sequence converging to the ech cohomology @xmath10 of the euclidean hull of a @xmath11dimensional tiling .    in  [ sec :",
    "pe homology of hierarchical tilings ] we present a method of computation for the pe homology of a hierarchical tiling , along with some worked through examples .",
    "the method is applicable to a broad range of tilings , including euclidean ` mixed substitution tilings ' ( see @xcite ) but also non - euclidean examples , such as bowers and stephenson s combinatorial pentagonal tilings ( see @xcite and  [ pentagonal ] ) .",
    "the ` approximant homology groups ' of the computation and the ` connecting maps ' between them have a direct description in terms of the combinatorics of the star - patches . in @xcite",
    ", gonalves used the duals of these approximant chain complexes for a computation of the @xmath12theory of the @xmath0algebra of the stable equivalence relation of a substitution tiling .",
    "our method of computation of the pe homology groups seems to confirm the observation there of a certain duality between these @xmath12groups and the @xmath12theory of the tiling space .",

    "denote the pair of @xmath19 and @xmath23 by @xmath24 , and the _ @xmath18skeleton _ @xmath25 by @xmath26 then @xmath24 is called a _ cw complex _ if :    1 .   for @xmath27",

    "in contrast , for a space with a _ triangulation _ , its topology is totally described up to homeomorphism by the combinatorial data of the simplexes and their incidences , i.e. , the data of which simplexes are faces of others .",
    "simplicial complexes are too restrictive to be practical as a starting point for us here ; most well - known tilings are naturally cellular but not simplicial .",
    "a good middle - ground between the versatility of cw complexes and the combinatorial nature of simplicial complexes seems to be the setting of _ regular _ cw complexes :    a cw complex @xmath24 is called _ regular _ if its characteristic maps may be chosen to be homeomorphisms .    for a cw complex @xmath24 and open @xmath18cell @xmath27 , the closure @xmath33 of @xmath22 in @xmath19 will be called a _ closed @xmath18cell _ of @xmath24 . in the case that @xmath24 is regular , each closed @xmath18cell is homeomorphic to the closed @xmath18disc @xmath14 .",
    "note , however , that the closed cells being homeomorphic to @xmath18discs does not guarantee that a cw complex is regular",
    ".      we shall now justify the assertion that regular cw complexes are combinatorial in character , and in so doing set up some important notation for the remainder of the paper .",

    "it shall also be applicable to mixed - substitution systems @xcite ( see  [ arnoux  rauzy ] ) .",
    "the method is best illustrated through examples , so we recommend the reader to skip the preliminary details of the general setting on a first reading and to head to  [ subsec : example computations ] , where the method is applied to a broad range of examples .",
    "the two main approaches to producing interesting examples of aperiodic tilings , such as the penrose tilings , are through the cut - and - project method ( see @xcite ) and through tiling substitutions ( see @xcite ) ; we shall focus on the latter .",
    "a substitution rule consists of a finite collection of _ prototiles _ of @xmath9 , a rule for subdividing these prototiles and an expanding dilation which , when applied to the subdivided prototiles , defines patches of translates of the original prototiles . by",
    "iterating this procedure and inflating , one produces larger and larger patches of tiles , each of which is a translate of one of the originals .",

    "an interesting set of examples are given by bowers and stephenson s pentagonal tilings @xcite .",

    "these symbolic sequences are often known as @xmath77adic systems . in general dimensions ,",
    "the tilings that arise are known as mixed or multi - substitution tilings @xcite .",

    "fix an infinite sequence @xmath747 for which each element of @xmath748 occurs infinitely often .",
    "then there exist bi - infinite _ arnoux  rauzy words _ for which every finite sub - word is contained in some translate of a ` supertile ' @xmath749 .",
    "we may consider such a word as defining a tiling of labelled unit intervals of @xmath660 .",
    "everything is recognisable , so for such a tiling @xmath536 , one may uniquely group the tiles to a tiling @xmath537 of tiles of labelled intervals ( although of different lengths ) so that the substitution @xmath750 decomposes @xmath537 to @xmath536 .",
    "the process may be repeated , so one in fact obtains an infinite hierarchy of tilings , the supertiles of which become arbitrarily large as one passes up the hierarchy .",
    "the two letter words of @xmath522 are the elements of @xmath751 with at least one occurrence of @xmath523 .",
    "so it is easy to see that @xmath752 is freely generated by the indicator @xmath491chains of vertices of the form @xmath753 where @xmath754 is arbitrary .",
    "a simple calculation shows that , with this choice of basis , the connecting map @xmath683 is the unimodular matrix @xmath755 given by the identity matrix with a column of @xmath344 s down the @xmath756 column which , incidentally , is the incidence matrix of the substitution .",
    "it follows that the degree one ech cohomology of the tiling space of the arnoux ",
    "rauzy words associated to any given sequence @xmath757 is @xmath758 it is interesting to note that the matrices above are related to continued fraction algorithms . for example , for the @xmath759 case , the arnoux ",
    "rauzy words are precisely the sturmian words . to an irrational @xmath569 , the sequence @xmath760 is chosen according to the continued fraction algorithm for @xmath569 ( see @xcite ) and the sequence of matrices @xmath755 of the above direct limit determine the partial quotients of @xmath569 . whilst the isomorphism classes of the first ech cohomology groups do not distinguish these tiling spaces , their order structure , which is determined by the above direct limit",
    ", is a rich invariant .",
    "let @xmath761 be the periodic tiling of @xmath9 of hypercubes with side - length @xmath762 and vertices on the lattice @xmath763 .",
    "these tilings define cellular decompositions @xmath764 of @xmath9 .",
    "define a partial ordering on @xmath765 by setting @xmath567 less than or equal to @xmath18 if and only if @xmath567 divides @xmath18 ; note that @xmath766 is a directed set . comparing patches via translation",
    ", we have that two cells @xmath767 are equivalent in the tiling @xmath761 ( to any given radius @xmath18 ) if and only if @xmath56 and @xmath68 are related by a vector of @xmath768 .",
    "then , with the partial order on @xmath765 given above , this defines a hierarchical system of tilings .",
    "indeed , for @xmath769 we have that local patches of @xmath770 determine those of @xmath771 by subdividing each of the hypercubes of side - length @xmath18 into @xmath772 hypercubes of side - length @xmath567 .",
    "define @xmath773 to be the sis associated to this hierarchical system of tilings , where we compare patches via translation . then a borel  moore chain is pe in @xmath773 if and only if it is invariant under translation by some full - rank sublattice . for @xmath774 , for example , it is easy to see that @xmath775 , the isomorphism identifies @xmath776 with the homology class of @xmath491chain which evaluates to @xmath777 on each vertex of the tiling @xmath778 of intervals of length @xmath779 .",
    "the group @xmath780 is freely generated by a fundamental class for @xmath660 .",
    "so for this example : @xmath781 the tiling space @xmath782 is the inverse limit of circles @xmath783 over the directed set @xmath766 , where for @xmath769 the map @xmath784 is given by the degree @xmath785 covering map .",
    "note that the sequence @xmath786 is linearly ordered and cofinal in @xmath766 , so : @xmath787 restricting the constructions above to the sequence @xmath788 , we realise example [ ex : dyadic ] . in this case , the tiling space is homeomorphic to @xmath789 the dyadic solenoid , and a borel  moore chain of @xmath660 is pe in this setup if and only if it is periodic with some period @xmath790 for @xmath762 .",
    "our final example will be a non - euclidean one .",
    "bowers and stephenson introduced in @xcite a combinatorial substitution of a pentagons which , analogously to the euclidean case , through repeated iteration produces larger and larger patches of tiles . these finite patches may be used to define combinatorial tilings with a certain hierarchical structure .",
    "of course , there is no tiling of euclidean space by regular pentagons .",
    "however , one may define a supporting metric space for which each @xmath11cell is isometric to a regular euclidean pentagon .",
    "the resulting tilings are supported on spaces conformally equivalent to the complex plane .    despite not being tilings of euclidean space , our methods here are essentially blind to the distinction , and will be as applicable to this example as to any euclidean substitution tiling . a bowers ",
    "stephenson pentagonal tiling defines a cw poset @xmath214 , and for each such tiling there is a uniquely defined ` supertiling ' which subdivides to it ; the substitution is recognisable .",
    "there is no natural notion of translation on the supporting spaces of these tilings , although there is of orientation , so we shall define @xmath5 by comparing patches of tiles using cellular isomorphisms which preserve the orientations of the @xmath11cells .",
    "there exist self - similarities of star - patches which are non - trivial on the source cells i.e. , @xmath11cells have @xmath397fold rotational symmetry and the @xmath344cells have local @xmath11fold symmetry .",
    "so to compute homology using the original cw decomposition of the tiling , the method will only work in general over divisible coefficients . to compute over @xmath4 coefficients",
    ", we note that there are two equivalence classes of @xmath491cells ( associated to valence @xmath530 and valence @xmath396 vertices ) , there is one equivalence class of @xmath344cell and one equivalence class of @xmath11cell .",
    "however , the @xmath344cells possess local symmetries reversing orientations on the @xmath344cells , so the approximant complexes over @xmath4 coefficients are @xmath791 it follows that the approximant homologies over @xmath4 coefficients are @xmath792 , @xmath491 , @xmath4 for @xmath486 , @xmath344 , @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we have that @xmath793 is generated over @xmath4 by a fundamental class , and it follows from the approximant homologies in degree one being trivial that @xmath794 . using the procedure outlined in ",
    "[ subsec : method ] one finds the connecting maps in degree zero to be isomorphisms , so @xmath795 .    to compute homology over integral coefficients ,",
    "we pass to a barycentric subdivision of the setup .",
    "now we have four vertex types : two of them corresponding to the two vertex types of the original cw decomposition @xmath214 , one corresponding the the barycentre of each edge and one corresponding the the barycentre of each pentagon .",
    "there are three edge types and two face types .",
    "so the approximant chain complexes over @xmath101 coefficients are @xmath796 one computes that @xmath678 , @xmath797 and @xmath798 .",
    "so @xmath799 , and of course @xmath800 is generated by a fundamental class .",
    "one may calculate the connecting map in degree zero as having eigenvectors which span @xmath313 and have eigenvalues @xmath344 and @xmath532 , and so @xmath801 $ ] .    to compute the pe cohomology of @xmath272 ( and hence the ech cohomology of the associated tiling space ) , one may use the modified pe chain complexes and implement poincar duality . at the approximant stage , this amounts to using instead the chain complexes @xmath802 since the vertices of @xmath273 possess local isotropy of orders @xmath11 , @xmath530 , @xmath396 and @xmath397 .",
