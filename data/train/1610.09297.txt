    "constructing mathematical models of real evolutionary phenomena is relevant in many fields .",
    "it is well known that the exponential curve is a basic model for the description of growth without constrains .",
    "it is solution of the differential equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the population size and @xmath2 is the growth rate .",
    "however , limitations of the availability of nutrients and habitat , for example , make the exponential curve not appropriate for the description of long - term growth .",
    "alternative formulations of growth models , mainly involving regulatory effects , have been proposed in the past to take into account that the population growth slows down when the resources run out .",
    "one of the first generalizations of ( [ exp_gr ] ) is the logistic equation @xmath3,\\qquad t>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 represents the so called carrying capacity , which is the maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely .",
    "several investigations contributed to the development of growth curves to describe specific behavior of the population dynamics , such as the logistic model and its generalizations ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , in @xcite a generalized form of the logistic growth has been introduced through the following equation : @xmath5^c,\\qquad t>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are positive constants , @xmath1 represents the populations size , and @xmath4 is still the carrying capacity .",
    "various well - known models arise as special cases of ( [ log_gen ] ) , such as the exponential , monomolecular , power , generalized von bertalanffy , specialized von bertalanffy , richards , smith , blumberg , hyperbolic , generic , schnute models ( for details , see @xcite ) . furthermore ,",
    "in various settings the constant growth rate @xmath9 of equation ( [ exp_gr ] ) is substituted by a time - dependent rate .",
    "when @xmath9 is replaced by a decreasing exponential function we obtain the gompertz model of population growth ( see @xcite ) , governed by equation @xmath10 another suitable choice leads to the korf type model ( see @xcite ) , described by @xmath11 note that both gompertz and korf models can be obtained also by means of special choices of the parameters in equation ( [ log_gen ] ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "another general model for biological growth was proposed by koya and goshu @xcite aiming to generalize the most common growth models such as brody , von bertalanffy , richards , weibull , monomolecular , mitscherlich , gompertz , logistic models , among others . in this case , the generalized growth function is defined as @xmath12}\\right\\}^m,\\qquad t>0,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the lower asymptote of @xmath1 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the time shift ( a constant ) , @xmath17 is the time scale ( a constant ) , @xmath18 is a shape parameter of the growth function ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the growth rate parameter .",
    "more recently , in order to model biological dynamics , a new class of growth curves has been proposed in @xcite as solution of the following differential equation : @xmath22 this extending both the gompertz and korf laws .    in order to introduce a new deterministic model of population growth which is to some extent related with the gompertz and korf laws",
    ", hereafter we recall some basic issues . due to ( [ gompertz ] )",
    ", the gompertz curve is expressed by : @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and is used to describe population dynamics in a confined habitat .",
    "it is also employed to describe plant disease progress @xcite , for mobile phone uptake @xcite , and as software reliability model @xcite . above all",
    ", the gompertz model plays a relevant role especially in modeling tumor growth ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . until recent time",
    ", it is a specific reference in this field ( see @xcite , for instance ) , and mainly in its stochastic form ( see @xcite ) .    according to ( [ korf ] ) ,",
    "the korf growth curve is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "in @xcite the korf growth function is used for the assessment of current and mean annual increments of douglas - fir compared to other tree species ( see also @xcite ) . moreover , in @xcite it is used for the construction of domestic yield tables , whereas torres _",
    "@xcite used korf and von bertalanffy models to fit curves as non - linear effects models , showing that korf model was superior .    on the ground of the above mentioned investigations , in this paper we aim to propose a new growth model which can not be obtained as a special case of the models ( [ log_gen ] ) , ( [ koya - goshu ] ) and ( [ other_gen ] ) .",
    "moreover , even if our model has the same carrying capacity of the gompertz and korf laws , it is able to capture different evolutionary dynamics . indeed , the new growth model is suitable to describe a phenomenon which behaves as the gompertz curve at the beginning of the evolution ( having the same initial value and initial slope ) , but for large times it grows slower than the gompertz law , as well as the korf curve .",
    "specific details on mathematical properties and their biological meaning for the proposed model are pinpointed in the first part of the paper .    until now we considered deterministic growth process only . however",
    ", stochastic fluctuations often are essential to describe real growth phenomena .",
    "indeed , some of the previous models have been formulated in the stochastic environment too .",
    "we recall that two examples of density - dependent birth - death processes whose means satisfy the logistic and gompertz equations are given in @xcite and @xcite , and a general theory for some non - homogeneous density - dependent birth - death processes has been developed in @xcite with special applications to stochastic logistic growth .",
    "logistic and gompertz type growth are used in @xcite as example to show the effect of the variability introduced into the generalized poulsen population model by assuming that the random number of offspring depends on the population size .",
    "we recall that birth - death processes are widely considered within applications in ecology , genetics and evolution ( see , e.g. , crawford and suchard @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other families of suitable point processes to describe population growth have been studied recently in di crescenzo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and in cha and finkelstein @xcite .",
    "moreover , diffusion stochastic processes have been proposed to take into account environmental fluctuations .",
    "for instance , the random effects of demographic and environmental stochasticity on a tumor immunology deterministic model is studied in @xcite throughout a stochastic differential equation , whose solution is a limiting diffusion process .",
    "furthermore , a stochastic diffusion model related to a reformulation of the richards growth curve is proposed in @xcite , and a gompertz - type diffusion process is introduced in @xcite , by means of which bounded sigmoidal growth patterns can be modeled by time - continuous variables .    in agreement with some of the previously mentioned investigations , aiming to extend the new growth law to a more realistic setting characterized by the presence of randomness , we construct and study two suitable stochastic processes whose means correspond to the proposed growth model : ( i ) a non - homogeneous birth - death process , and ( ii ) a simple birth process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : model ] the new model is introduced and its main properties are investigated , with special attention to the correction factor , the relative growth rate , the inflection point , the maximum specific growth rate , the lag time and the threshold crossing problem . a comparison to the gompertz and korf models is also performed with purpose of showing novelties of the proposed models , and analogies and differences among the three considered laws . in section [",
    "sect : dataex ] , some data analytic examples are considered in order to show that the new model can better describe some evolutionary phenomena with respect to the other ones .",
    "section [ sect : linearbd ] is devoted to a linear time - inhomogeneous birth - death process whose mean behaves as the proposed deterministic model . in particular",
    ", we analyze the transition probabilities , the mean , the variance and the population extinction probability of this model .",
    "we also point out that the transition probabilities obtained in proposition [ prop:1 ] correct an expression given in a previous paper .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sect : simpleb ] we investigate a simple birth process mimicking the new growth model , giving attention to its transition probabilities , the mean , the variance , the index of dispersion , the coefficient of variation and the first - passage - time problem .    throughout the paper primes denote derivatives ; moreover we set @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "a general model for population growth can often be described by an ordinary differential equation of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a time - dependent growth rate . clearly , if @xmath31 then eq .  ( [ eq : nt ] ) yields the differential equation ( [ gompertz ] ) of the gompertz growth and that of the korf growth ( [ korf ] ) .",
    "hereafter we consider an alternative choice of the growth rate , given by @xmath32 so that , from ( [ eq : nt ] ) we obtain the ordinary differential equation @xmath33 accordingly , we propose the following curve for growth model , with @xmath34 , @xmath35\\right\\}},\\quad t>0 , \\qquad n(0)=y>0,\\ ] ] which is solution of ( [ new ] ) . in brief , such a model is motivated by the need of describing evolutionary dynamics characterized by non - zero initial values and approximately linear initial slope , and tending to a carrying capacity from below through a long - term power - law growth .",
    "we recall that various examples of population growth showing power - law behavior have been considered in the recent literature ( see , for instance , karev @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the growth and the decay rates , respectively , for the three models given in ( [ gompertz_sol ] ) , ( [ korf_sol ] ) and ( [ new_sol ] ) .",
    "the model proposed in ( [ new_sol ] ) , as well as the gompertz and korf curves , stems from a linear equation .",
    "indeed , we purpose to deal with a rather simple model that allows a feasible treatment from mathematical and statistical points of view , differently from more general equations similar to ( [ log_gen ] ) .",
    "note that equations ( [ gompertz ] ) , ( [ korf ] ) and ( [ new ] ) are all linear , characterized by growth rates @xmath38 which are decreasing convex and asymptotically vanishing functions .",
    "consequently , such common feature yields that the three curves @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath1 share some characteristics . indeed ,",
    "due to ( [ gompertz_sol ] ) , ( [ korf_sol ] ) and ( [ new_sol ] ) , such three curves are increasing in @xmath41 , and are bounded by the same carrying capacity , i.e. @xmath42 moreover , it is not hard to show that @xmath43 in other terms , for fixed choices of the parameters @xmath44 , the new proposed model describes an intermediate growth between the ( lower ) korf and ( upper ) gompertz curves .",
    "furthermore , in remark [ rem:1 ] below we see that for small values of @xmath41 the curve @xmath1 behaves similarly as @xmath45 , whereas for large times it grows similarly as @xmath46 , since it tends to the carrying capacity polynomially fast .    [ rem:1 ]",
    "the growth model ( [ new_sol ] ) captures certain features of both the gompertz and korf laws .",
    "indeed , the curve ( [ new_sol ] ) behaves as the gompertz curve ( [ gompertz_sol ] ) for @xmath41 close to @xmath47 , being @xmath48 the korf law ( [ korf_sol ] ) has a rather different initial behavior , since @xmath49 and @xmath50 . on the contrary , for large values of @xmath41",
    ", the proposed model behaves more similarly to the korf law .",
    "specifically , even though the three models have the same carrying capacity ( [ carrying_capacity ] ) , the three curves tend to @xmath51 according to different rules . indeed , from eqs .",
    "( [ gompertz_sol ] ) , ( [ korf_sol ] ) and ( [ new_sol ] ) we have @xmath52 hence , for any curve @xmath53 the term @xmath54 tends to 0 when @xmath55 .",
    "however , for the gompertz law this limit is attained exponentially fast , whereas for the other two laws it is reached according to power law with exponent @xmath37 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the three growth curves are shown for some choices of the parameters . note that when @xmath37 increases , the curves ( [ korf_sol ] ) and ( [ new_sol ] ) tend to the gompertz one .",
    "= 5.1 cm = 5.1 cm = 5.1 cm    some interesting limit behaviors of the curves ( [ gompertz_sol ] ) , ( [ korf_sol ] ) and ( [ new_sol ] ) are shown in table 1 , for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "we observe that when the growth rate @xmath36 goes to zero and when @xmath36 goes to infinity , the three curves have all the same behavior , i.e.  they tend to @xmath61 in the first case , and to @xmath62 in the second case . indeed",
    ", the population size exhibits a very pronounced growth when @xmath36 is very large , since the carrying capacity tends to @xmath62 when @xmath36 diverges , due to ( [ carrying_capacity ] ) .",
    "moreover , for @xmath63 the curves admit the same limit @xmath61 , except for the korf case when @xmath64 .    in the following we analyze some features of the proposed model , and we perform some comparisons with the gompertz and the korf models .",

    "some plots of @xmath65 are shown in fig .",

    "we point out that even though the birth - death process considered in this section has conditional mean identical to the growth curve ( [ new_sol ] ) , the behavior of the sample paths of @xmath83 may be significantly different from such growth curve , since they can be absorbed at zero ( recall eqs .",

    "although this characteristic allows @xmath83 to be more realistic for some biological applications , in order to make the stochastic process closer to the growth curve , hereafter we remove the possibility of downward jumps .",
    "this leads to a birth process , that is clearly more appropriate to describe pure growth phenomena since its sample paths are non - decreasing .",
    "in this section we investigate a time - inhomogeneous birth process , which is a special case of the process studied in section [ sect : spcase ] , whose mean is identical to the growth curve proposed in eq .",

    "note that such conditions both imply @xmath117 , so that a good correspondence between the two models is expected for a low birth rate .",
    "let us now discuss a first - passage - time problem for @xmath83 , in analogy with the threshold crossing problem analyzed in section [ sec : thresholdcrossing ] .",
    "the determination and analysis of first - passage - time densities in biological modeling deserve large interest , since such functions provide essential information on the probability that some critical or beneficial levels are attained by the stochastic process under investigation .",

    "we investigated various properties of such a model , with attention to the main characteristics of interest in growth models , and performed various comparisons .",
    "some examples of application of the proposed curve for the description of real growth phenomena have been shown , supported by an analysis of the performance based on suitable parameters .    in order to study a stochastic counterpart of the proposed model , we investigated a linear time - inhomogeneous birth - death process whose mean is identical to the proposed deterministic model .",
    "we obtained the transition probabilities , the moments and the population extinction of this process .",
    "however , even if the mean of such stochastic process is identical to the proposed growth curve , the considered birth - death model possesses an absorbing endpoint at zero and thus it may be not appropriate to describe a growth behavior .",
    "hence , in order to overcome this drawback we finally studied a time - inhomogeneous birth process , whose mean again corresponds to the proposed growth curve , thus being more suitable to describe a pure growth phenomenon .",

    "<S> we propose a new deterministic growth model which captures certain features of both the gompertz and korf laws . we investigate its main properties , with special attention to the correction factor , the relative growth rate , the inflection point , the maximum specific growth rate , the lag time and the threshold crossing problem . </S>",
    "<S> some data analytic examples and their performance are also considered . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study a stochastic counterpart of the proposed model , that is a linear time - inhomogeneous birth - death process whose mean behaves as the deterministic one . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the transition probabilities , the moments and the population ultimate extinction probability for this process . </S>",
    "<S> we finally treat the special case of a simple birth process , which better mimics the proposed growth model .    _ </S>",
