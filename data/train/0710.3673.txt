    "in the last decades it has been recognized the central role that the fluctuations around stationary states play for a microscopic theory of nonequilibrium phenomena @xcite .",
    "furthermore , biological sciences and nano - technology are ever more interested in nonequilibrium fluctuations .",
    "the 1993 paper by evans , cohen and morriss @xcite , on the fluctuations of the entropy production rate of a deterministic particle system , modeling a shearing fluid , provided a unifying framework for a variety of nonequilibrium phenomena , under a mathematical expression nowadays called _ fluctuation relation _ ( fr ) .",
    "they proposed and tested the following formula    [ firstfr ] e^a    where @xmath2 is the average of the power dissipated on evolution segments of duration @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the probability that @xmath2 takes a value in an interval of length @xmath5 , centered at @xmath6 . in analogy with the periodic orbit expansions @xcite , eq .",
    ", was obtained from the `` lyapunov weights '' in the long @xmath3 limit .",
    "remarkably , eq .  , does not contain any adjustable parameter .    in 1994 ,",
    "evans and searles obtained the first transient frs for the energy dissipation rate divided by @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath8 @xcite , which we call transient , and which concern the statistics of an evolving ensemble of systems , instead of the steady state statistics .",
    "the only requirement for the transient s to hold is the reversibility of the microscopic dynamics . because they describe the behaviour of @xmath8 ,",
    "these relations can be experimentally verified @xcite .    in 1995 ,",
    "gallavotti and cohen provided a mathematical justification of the lyapunov weights of ref.@xcite , introducing the chaotic hypothesis @xcite , which states that : `` a reversible many - particle system in a stationary state can be regarded as a transitive anosov system , for the purpose of computing its macroscopic properties '' .",
    "the result was a genuine steady state fr , which we call , as it concerns the fluctuations of the phase space contraction rate @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity equals the energy dissipation rate @xmath1 in a subclass of gaussian isoenergetic particle systems , which includes the model of @xcite , while in many other cases @xmath0 differs from @xmath1 by a total derivative .",
    "as far as we know , the works @xcite provide the only answer that has been given so far to the question of which dynamical systems can be proven to verify the steady state @xmath0-fr . a strong assumption as the chaotic hypothesis raises the question of which systems of physical interest are `` anosov - like '' , since almost none of them is actually anosov .",
    "the answer of refs.@xcite is that the anosov property , in analogy with the ergodic property , holds `` in practice '' for sufficiently chaotic , reversible systems .",
    "a complementary approach , which addresses a different question , has been recently proposed in @xcite , developing ideas first introduced by evans and searles , see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "the question concerns the physical mechanisms at work in systems which do obey the steady state @xmath1-fr .",
    "this approach leads to a general framework within which various transient and steady state relations can be obtained for a variety of observables , and especially leads to the identification of physical mechanisms and time scales underlying the validity of the steady state frs .",
    "the result is that , while the transient relations only rest on time reversibility , the steady state relations do require further properties to hold . in @xcite , a property called `` @xmath8-autocorrelation decay '' is identified as the reason for the steady state , as well as of a number of other asymptotic relations , to be verified , when they do .",
    "this approach leads to the identification of the time scales concerning the frs with the decay times of a quantity which we introduce in section [ sec : ssft ] .",
    "therefore , the need arises to test on concrete systems the validity of this identification and to quantify the corresponding time scales .",
    "these issues are closely related with the role played in the dynamics by the singularities of the total derivative which distinguishes @xmath0 from @xmath1 .",
    "this has been discussed in various papers , like @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the investigation of such questions .",
    "we study the heat transport and its transient and steady state fluctuations , in a mechanical dissipative system that is maintained out of equilibrium by an imposed temperature gradient .",
    "this local thermostating mechanism leaves unaltered the newtonian dynamics in the bulk of the system , dissipating only at its boundaries .",
    "however , due to the interactions , dissipation may depend on the non thermostated degrees of freedom ( _ d.o.f .",
    "_ ) as well @xcite . to impose a temperature gradient we use deterministic thermostats ,",
    "that add a time - dependent friction term to the hamiltonian of the system in such a way that , if the system is ergodic , the energy distribution of the thermostated is boltzmann distributed with well defined temperature . as a consequence of the use of thermostats , the phase space contraction rate is unbounded , possibly leading to statistical properties of its large fluctuations which are not described by the standard fr ( [ firstfr ] ) .",
    "this scenario has been considered in various works , and depends on the form of the tails of the distribution of the observables of interest , see e.g.@xcite . as far as particle systems are concerned , the corresponding modified fr appears to be consistent with the thermostated lorentz gas @xcite . in our case , consistently with the cited literature , the unboundedness of @xmath0 does not imply any modification of the standard fr .",
    "the distribution of the fluctuations of @xmath0 , indeed , appear to have gaussian tails .",
    "therefore , the search for deterministic particle systems which verify a modified version of fr , apart from the case of @xcite , must continue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after defining the many - body dissipative model that we will use , in section  [ sec : model ] we discuss the equilibrium and nonequilibrium states that arise from the coupling with the local thermostats . in section  [ sec : ft ] we study the transient and the steady state fluctuation relations for the phase space contraction rate , and for the dissipation function .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the model we consider consists of a gas of non - interacting point - like particles of mass @xmath10 that move freely inside a channel made of @xmath11 identical two - dimensional cells .",
    "each cell consists of a rectangular region of height @xmath12 and width @xmath13 , containing two fixed freely rotating disks of radius @xmath14 and moment of inertia @xmath15 .",
    "the position of the disks in each cell and their radius are chosen so that the geometry of the channel corresponds to a periodic lorentz gas in a triangular lattice at critical horizon , defined as the smallest disk radius to disks separation ratio such that the length of the particle s trajectory between two collisions with the disks is bounded .",
    "the lattice of scatterers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "moreover , the particles and disks are allowed to exchange energy at collisions , according to `` perfectly rough '' collisions , that are reversible , conserve total energy and angular momentum .",
    "these collisions are defined by the following formulae , which relate the normal and tangential components of the particle s velocity @xmath16 with respect to the disk s surface , and the disk s angular velocity @xmath17 before ( unprimed quantities ) and after ( primed quantities ) the collision @xcite    [ eq : col - rules ] & v_n  & = &  -v_n + & v_t  & = &   v_t - ( v_t - r ) + & r  & = &  r+ ( v_t - r )  .",
    "thus , collisions are deterministic , time - reversible and phase space volume preserving .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 is the only relevant dimensionless parameter characterizing the collision .",
    "it determines the energy transfer between disks and particles in a collision . for finite values of @xmath18 , the particles indirectly exchange energy with each other , through the interactions with the disks , even though they do not directly interact .",
    "this model , introduced in @xcite as a mechanical model for coupled heat and matter transport , shows realistic equilibrium and out of equilibrium thermodynamical properties , in very different situations , _",
    "e.g. _ when subjected to external gradients of temperature and chemical potential , in the presence of external electric or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the simple energy exchange mechanism allows the equipartition of the energy among all the _ d.o.f .",
    "_ , allowing the system to reach a local thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "in particular , in microcanonical simulations , the particle velocities are maxwellian distributed at uniform `` temperature '' consistent with the equipartition theorem .",
    "these temperatures also characterize the distribution of angular velocities of the rotating scatterers . the same is true in canonical and grancanonical simulations , where the system is subjected to temperature and chemical potential gradients .",
    "one consequence of the establishment of local thermal equilibrium is that the gas of particles is described locally by the equations of state of ideal gases .",
    "recently , the properties of the stationary state for a modified version of this model , coupled to stochastic energy and particles reservoirs , have been analytically obtained in the weak coupling limit @xcite , and finite coupling corrections have been obtained in @xcite .     cells .",
    "the disks of radius @xmath14 form a triangular lattice at critical horizon , meaning that the height and width of the cells equal , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the separation between the centers of the disks .",
    "periodic boundary conditions along the vertical direction are considered .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the single hexagonal cells .",
    "the solid lines are hard walls . at the left top",
    "we schematically show a single collision : when a particle collides with a disk at an angle @xmath23 with respect to the normal at the collision point , the outgoing angle of its trajectory @xmath24 is determined by eq .",
    "[ eq : col - rules ] . in between collisions , the angular velocity of the disk @xmath17 evolves freely for the disks in the bulk ( empty disks ) and according to eq .",

    "the bulk of the system was coupled to stochastic thermochemical baths , so to exchange energy and particles at the boundaries .",
    "differently , we consider a closed system ( particle number is conserved ) , and model the heat baths as local thermostats @xcite . roughly speaking a thermostat adds a kind of friction term to a number of degrees of freedom , whose energy fluctuations turn to be canonical at some temperature @xmath27 , as a result .",
    "more precisely , consider @xmath28 with generalized positions @xmath29 , momenta @xmath30 and mass @xmath10 , subjected to an external potential @xmath31 described by the nos hamiltonian @xcite ,    [ eq : nose ] & h_(,,x,,s ) &  =  & _ i=1^ + ( ) + + & &  +  & + ( g+1)t x  .",

    "furthermore , if one is solely interested in real time averages , the equations of motion that derive from can be rewritten in terms of the physical variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath38 , eliminating the variables @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath43 and @xmath35 to obtain @xcite ,    [ eq : nh ] &  & = &   , + &  & = &  -- p_i  , + &  & = &  ( _ i=1^ - 1 )  , +    where @xmath46 is the relaxation time of the thermostat related to its effective mass @xmath34 as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , ( in what follows we will refer to the variable @xmath49 as the thermostat ) . inspecting eqs .  , known as the equations of motion , the role of the thermostat @xmath49 becomes evident : it acts as a friction term that appropriately changes sign , depending on whether the instantaneous kinetic energy of the @xmath28 thermostated is larger or smaller than the desired mean kinetic energy @xmath50 .    to simulate a nonequilibrium state , we couple thermostats to the angular velocity of each of the four disks at the boundaries of the channel .",
    "since the disks are pinned to their positions , the thermostats can interact with the rest of the only via the collisions with the point - like moving gas particles .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 and @xmath52 the thermostats for the upper and lower disks at the cold side and as @xmath53 and @xmath54 the thermostats for the upper and lower disks at the hot side , thus @xmath55 .",
    "note that it is possible to couple the two disks at each boundary to one single thermostat , in which case , @xmath56 .",
