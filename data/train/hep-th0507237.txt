    ", we give an approximate ( neglecting the effect of radiative friction ) poincar - invariant description of the effective dynamics of a thin electrically charged string with a current .",
    "the importance of studying the effective dynamics of such strings is beyond doubt because of the numerous applications , both in practice and theoretical models , of extended charged and / or conducting objects with negligible transverse dimensions . for instance , the effective equations of motion obtained in section [ charged string ] are applied to two specific models of strings in sections [ charged loop ] and [ non - stretched string ] . in section [ charged loop ]",

    "[ non - stretched string ] , we study the effective dynamics of an absolutely nonstretchable charged string with a current . in section [",
    "charged string ] , we derive the effective equations of motion for a charged string with a current and discuss some of their properties ; in particular , in the case of a reparametrization - invariant free action of a string , we find the generators of gauge transformations and the constraints on the possible form of the current that flows along the string .    we will describe a charged string within the model of an infinitely thin string . it is well known that the self - action of such a string leads to a diverging expression for the force of the self - action , because infinitely close points of an infinitely thin charged string interact with infinite force .",
    "the regularization procedure , whose physical meaning consists in `` smearing '' a singular source of the electromagnetic field , allows one to represent the self - action force as an asymptotic series in the regularization parameter  the cross - section radius of the string  which contains one logarithmically divergent term . the smaller the cross - section radius of the string , the greater the contribution of this divergent term to the self - action force . for a sufficiently thin string , one may neglect other terms of the asymptotic series to obtain effective equations of motion for a thin charged string in the form of a system of differential equations rather than integrodifferential equations , as in the case when all terms of the asymptotic series are taken into account .",
    "similar equations are obtained when describing the effective dynamics of cosmic strings ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we find the leading contribution of the self - action of an electrically charged string with a current and derive equations of motion for the string in an external field with regard to this correction .",

    "we consider the effective dynamics of an absolutely elastic charged string in the form of a ring ( a circle ) .",

    "the last mentioned model describes the behavior of a high - current beam of charged particles in a synchrotron .",
    "consider a gauge that is convenient for further calculations .",
    "introduce coordinates @xmath65 so that the vector density @xmath66 is straightened in these coordinates ; i.e. , it has the form @xmath67 .",

    "formula can be rewritten as @xmath104 the second equation in implies that @xmath105    the requirements that the radicand be nonnegative and that the velocity of the string be less than the velocity of light impose constraints on the fields @xmath106 and @xmath107 , under which stable states of the ring may exist .",
    "these requirements are illustrated graphically in fig .",

    "for example , if there is no electric field and a ring of radius @xmath108 is uniformly charged , then the magnetic field can hold this ring only if @xmath109 where @xmath89 is the total charge of the ring .",
    "equations are rather complicated in the general case ; therefore , we restrict the analysis to a uniformly charged ring ( @xmath110 ) for @xmath111 . then , we have @xmath112 where we used the fact that the equality @xmath110 implies the equality @xmath113 . the substitution of the expression for @xmath114 into the equation for @xmath115 in yields equations for the fields that admit such stationary configurations .",
    "for example , in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath116 , we obtain the following solution to : @xmath117 whereas , in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath118 , eqs . lead to the equalities @xmath119",
    "thus , a uniformly charged ring does not change its radius only if the external fields satisfy eqs .",
    "( or eqs . and in the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic cases , respectively ) , provided , of course , that @xmath111 .",
    "now , we proceed to solving the dynamical equations .",

    "the solution of the second equation in yields @xmath120 then , the first equation takes the form @xmath121 whence @xmath122 if , in addition , we require that @xmath113 , which physically means that all points of the ring rotate with the same velocity , then we obtain the solution @xmath123 as expected , the equation for @xmath124 represents the angular momentum conservation law .",
    "solution shows that , after a certain period of time , the ring will expand with a velocity close to the velocity of light ; therefore , it is worthwhile to consider the ultrarelativistic limit of eq . ;",
    "i.e. , it is worthwhile to require that @xmath125 . in this case",
    ", we have the following conservation law : @xmath126 this equation can be solved by the method of characteristics ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in a particular case",

    "the first equation in resembles the equation of motion of a particle of unit mass with zero total energy in the potential field @xmath145/2 $ ] the only difference between these equations is that the form of @xmath146 depends on the initial data @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 ( see fig .",
    "[ plot for u ] ) .",
    "the potential has a single extremum at the point @xmath150 and indefinitely increases as @xmath151 and @xmath152 ; therefore , for any initial data , the system will oscillate about the equilibrium point @xmath153 .",
    "note that the minimal value of @xmath153 is equal to @xmath154 , which agrees with the results of the previous analysis of the stationary states of a charged ring .",
    "we can evaluate the ratio of the oscillation frequency @xmath155 of the charged ring in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point @xmath153 to the mean angular frequency @xmath156 of its rotation . in the harmonic approximation , the first frequency",
    "is defined by @xmath157 , and the second , by @xmath158 ; hence , we have @xmath159 where @xmath160 .",
    "this ratio uniformly increases from @xmath161 to infinity as @xmath153 increases ; for large values of @xmath153 it increases as @xmath162 .",
    "for example , a threefold increase in the linear dimensions of a synchrotron leads to a ninefold increase in the oscillation frequency for the same mean angular velocities of the high - current beam of particles , other characteristics , such as @xmath106 , @xmath89 and @xmath163 , remaining constant .",
    "thus , an absolutely elastic uniformly charged ring in a uniform magnetic field oscillates about the equilibrium point @xmath153 , @xmath164 , according to eqs . with frequency @xmath155 ; the ratio of this frequency to the angular frequency of the ring is defined by .",
    "therefore , we can expect that , when the energy inflow compensates the energy losses , a high - current beam of charged particles in a synchrotron will also produce radiation at this frequency , in addition to the well - known synchrotron radiation .",
    "for example , if one could separate these two types of radiation by certain characteristics and measure the ratio @xmath165 , then one would determine the equilibrium position @xmath153 in the units of @xmath166 by formula .    among the disadvantages of the model of an absolutely elastic charged string as applied to the description of a high - current beam of charged particles",
    "is the fact that this model does not take into account the radiation reaction due to the synchrotron radiation , which becomes significant at large angular velocities .",
    "in this section , we consider the dynamics of a thin , absolutely nonstretchable charged string with a current with regard to the first - order correction due to the self - action .",
    "we derive equations of motion for such a string , investigate its stationary states in the absence of an external electromagnetic field , and find a class of solutions to the equations of motion for a uncharged string with a current and for a uniformly charged string .",
    "suppose given a closed string @xmath0 with coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath167 , that is embedded into the minkowski space @xmath4 by a smooth mapping @xmath168 .",
