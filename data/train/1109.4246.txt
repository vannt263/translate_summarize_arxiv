    "metastates are useful concepts in analyzing the large - volume dependence of disordered systems , both of lattice and mean - field systems .",
    "they go back to the constructions of aizenman and wehr @xcite , and newman and stein @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we continue to analyze a class of mean - field systems , moving from a situation where the quenched disorder was assumed to be i.i.d .",
    "@xcite to a situation where the disorder is generated by a markov chain .",
    "our models have a finite local state space @xmath0 , and a finite space @xmath1 of possible values of the local disorder variables . while in the previous analysis",
    "the disorder variables were assumed to be i.i.d . over the sites ,",
    "we now treat a quenched disorder which is correlated and generated by a markov chain with transition matrix @xmath2 . for a study of the curie - weiss model in a dynamical external field",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a metastate is a probability measure on the infinite - volume gibbs measures of a disordered system which intuitively gives the likehood to pick a gibbs state in a large but finite volume . for precise definitions",
    "see below and refer to the books @xcite .",
    "non - trivial metastates can occur when the phenomenon of random symmetry breaking appears , meaning that two or more states are equivalent on the average , but their symmetry is broken by disorder fluctuations in finite volume .",
    "for examples of disordered models with such random symmetry breaking see @xcite , for genuine applications of metastate idea to spin - glasses see @xcite and in particular the groundstate uniqueness result in 2d proved in @xcite .",
    "now , in the finite - type mean - field models of @xcite precise limit theorems for the weights in the metastates were derived , combining a multivariate clt for disorder fluctuations and a large - deviation analysis of the spin - part of the model .",
    "further a geometric picture was given to identify the _",
    "invisible states _ , namely those gibbs states which are always overshadowed by disorder fluctuations favoring other competing states .",
    "in the present paper we ask : what changes if the external randomness comes from a markov chain ?",
    "suppose we are dealing with a non - degenerate markov chain on a finite state - space at first , meaning that the covariance matrix @xmath3 of the limiting gaussian distribution of the occupation time - vector of the markov chain @xmath2 has the full possible rank .",
    "then the basic structure of the theorems stays the same , using the same geometric construction to identify visible gibbs states @xmath4 and their weights @xmath5 . however , let us stress the main difference to the independent case , which is that the @xmath5 s are given in terms of @xmath3 and this object carries more information about the markov chain then just its invariant distribution @xmath6 . which states are gibbs states depends on @xmath6 , but the precise form of the weights and whether a given state is visible or not can vary over markov chains having the same @xmath6 but different transition matrix @xmath2 .",
    "this is different from the i.i.d .",
    "case where the single - site distribution @xmath6 completely specifies the disorder distribution .",
    "new phenomena on an even more fundamental level appear when we allow for markov chains which are degenerate , i.e. , whose @xmath3 does not have full rank .",
    "we specify to a concrete example and look at the 3-state random field potts model , with @xmath7-state local random fields coupling by delta - interaction in the hamiltonian to the spins .",
    "we take @xmath2 on to be doubly stochastic ergodic matrix which can be seen as a softened version of a permutation matrix , where one keeps however one ( and only one ) transition between an ordered pair of states to be deterministic , say from state @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "although the equidistribution on the states is invariant and the covariance matrix @xmath3 becomes degenerate but is symmetric under exchange of states @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , the metastate for the random model with disorder generated by the markov chain in equilibrium is not symmetric under an exchange of the spin labels @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "such a phenomenon is only possible because of two features : the almost degeneracy between two gibbs - states up to finite but non - zero free energy differences in arbitrary large volumes in the possible realizations of the chain , and the lack of time - reversal symmetry of the markov chain .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review definitions about metastates and the constructions from @xcite needed for mean - field models , including the geometry of free energy fluctuations and derivation of weights for pure states .",
    "then we are ready to give the result of the present paper about metastates for non - degenerate markov chains .",
    "next we present the results for the @xmath7-state potts model with quenched disorder generated by a degenerate chain . in section 3 the proofs for non - degenerate markov chains",
    "are given , building on results of the previous paper @xcite . in section 4 the proof for the @xmath7-state potts model in the degenerate case",
