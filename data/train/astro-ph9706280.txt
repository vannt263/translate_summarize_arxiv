    "the hi tully - fisher relation has been the most successful and widely applied tool to measure distances to galaxies ( e.g. , tully & fisher 1977 ; aaronson et al .",
    "1986 ; pierce & tully 1988 ) .",
    "co linewidth has been also used in the instead of hi linewidth .",
    "hi linewidth almost coincides with co linewidth for galaxies in the coma cluster and other nearby clusters ( dickey & kazes 1992 ) , for field galaxies ( sofue 1992 ; schniger & sofue 1994 ) and for virgo cluster galaxies ( schniger & sofue 1997 ) .    because the beamsize of co observations is much sharper than that for hi , we are able to resolve individual galaxies at higher redshift , and avoid contamination by other galaxies in one beam for co observations .",
    "observations for the co - line tully - fisher relation have been performed using the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45-m telescope ( hpbw = 15  ) , and co linewidths have been obtained for galaxies at redshift @xmath0 29,000 ( sofue et al .",
    "1996 ) , at which the co beamsize is still small enough to distinguish galaxies .",
    "hi gas extends far from the center of galaxies beyond the optical radius , while it is deficient in the central region ( bosma 1981 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the molecular gas is known to be more concentrated in a better correlation with the optical disk ( young & scoville , 1982 ) . since the atomic and molecular gases in galactic disk are distributed separately in radius ( sofue et al.1995 ; honma et al.1995 ) , the hi linewidths may be more strongly disturbed by galaxy - galaxy interaction , which is inevitable in rich clusters of galaxies and at high redshifts .",
    "interacting galaxies are generally excluded from a sample of nearby galaxies for the tully - fisher relation .",
    "however , when we measure distances to farther galaxies , we may overlook features of interaction and overestimate the distances .    in this paper",
    "we examine the correlation between co and hi linewidths of nearby galaxies and discuss the tully - fisher relation for interacting galaxies .",
    "in this study the data of co linewidths are taken from young et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who observed the @xmath1co ( @xmath2 ) emission line of 300 field galaxies using the 14-m telescope of the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) ( hpbw = 45  ) . among them",
    "the co emission was detected at multiple positions for 103 galaxies .",
    "we excluded the following galaxies from our analysis ; ( 1 ) galaxies for which we could not obtain linewidths due to weak or strange position - velocity diagrams , ( 2 ) face - on galaxies ( @xmath3 ) in order to minimize the effect of inner velocity dispersion .",
    "as the result of these selection we selected 60 galaxies .",
    "we classified these galaxies into 17 interacting galaxies and 43 isolated galaxies .",
    "then we classified the interacting galaxies into three subclasses using the interaction class ( hereafter iac ) defined by dahari ( 1985 ) .",
    "although the dahari s iac is classified into 6 groups based on features of interaction , we classified them into three classes due to the small sample .",
    "our classification based on dahari s iac is as follows ;      according to dahari s classification , iac = 1 stands for isolated galaxies .",
    "the classification for individual galaxies based on dahari s method is described in table 3a and 3b , as well as column 9 in table 1 .",
    "the galaxies which dahari classified are marked with asterisks .",
    "the co linewidths are obtained from position - velocity diagrams in the literature ( young et al .",
    "the hi linewidth and inclination of galaxies are taken from huchtmeier & richter ( 1989 ) . among hi data in the catalog , we selected the data observed at arecibo 1000-ft , effelsberg 100-m , nrao green bank 300-ft , jodrell bank 250-ft and parks 64-m telescopes in order to keep the quality of data set .",
    "linewidths are defined as the full width at 20% of maximum intensity of the global profile . in order to correct for an inclination effect ,",
    "we adjust to an edge - on orientation by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the observed linewidth , @xmath6 is the inclination and @xmath7 is the linewidth corrected for the inclination .",
    "total magnitude , the galactic and internal extinction corrections and radial velocity corrected to the galactic standard of rest are taken from the third reference catalog of bright galaxies(rc3 ) ( de vaucouleurs et al ."
