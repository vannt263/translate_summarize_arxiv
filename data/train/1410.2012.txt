    "last decade was quite an exciting and productive period in particle physics .",
    "starting from the first observation of the @xmath0 meson by the belle collaboration @xcite up to now more than twenty new charmonium states have been observed ( for a review see @xcite).the main lesson from these discoveries is that these states ( referred as @xmath10 states ) can not be described by the simple quark model , i.e. , as a quark - antiquark system , and they are believed to have more complex structures .",
    "understanding the structure and dynamics of these states is one of the hot problems in particle physics . in investigating the properties of these states two pictures",

    "the mass and some of the strong coupling constants of the xyz mesons with light mesons are widely studied within the qcd sum rules method @xcite in many works ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the first calculation of the mass of the @xmath0 meson as a tetra - quark state with the quantum numbers @xmath11 is performed within qcd sum rules method in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson as a @xmath12 molecular state with the interpolating current , [ eboz01 ] j_^mol = 1  , was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the next step in analysis of the properties of @xmath0 is that it is assumed to be a mixture of the charmonium and @xmath1 molecules @xcite .",
    "the interpolating current has the form , [ eboz02 ] j_^(1 ) = _ 1 j_^ch + _ 1 j_^mol  , where [ nolabel01 ] j_^ch = 16 ( |c _ _ 5 c )  , and @xmath13 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eboz01 ] ) . in @xcite , in order to reproduce the experimental value of the mass , the mixing angle is calculated to be @xmath14 .",

    "its interpolating current can be written as , [ eboz03 ] j^(2 ) = _ 2 ( - |cc ) + _ 2(|q _ c)(|c^q )  . in the same manner ,",
    "the mixing angle is calculated by requiring that it should reproduce the mass of the @xmath2 state , and is found to have the value @xmath15 .    finally , if one assumes that @xmath16 state is a mixture of the tetra quark and the charmonium current given as @xcite , [ eboz04 ] j_^(3 ) = _ 3 j_^ch + _ 3 j_^tet  , where [ eboz05 ] j_^ch",

    "any physical quantity should be independent of them , and therefore our primary aim is to find the regions of @xmath43 and @xmath25 , where the mass and residue are practically independent of them . it should be noted here that the continuum threshold itself is not a totally arbitrary parameter , but related to the first excited state . however , since no up to date information is available about the first excited states of the considered charmonium states , we take the value of the continuum threshold as @xmath44",

    "we would like to note here that , only @xmath52 state is sensitive to the change in the value of the mixing angle @xmath47 . with the increasing value of @xmath47 , the mass of the @xmath52 state is decreasing , for example , at @xmath53 @xmath54 ; and at @xmath55 @xmath56 .    from these predictions of the masses of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath52 states , and the experimental values of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath16 states we observe that the splittings among these states are at most @xmath57 .",
    "these results can be checked in future planned experiments after the discovery of the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath52 states .",
    "the predicted results for the residues of the @xmath52 and @xmath16 ; and @xmath2 states respectively are very close to each other , while the result for the @xmath21 state is three times larger compared to that of the @xmath0 state .    using the picture that assumes @xmath0 as the mixture of the charmonium and the molecular @xmath1 states ; @xmath2 as the mixture of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states ; and @xmath5 as the mixture of the tetra - quark and charmonium states , we calculate the mass and the residues of their orthogonal states within the qcd sum rules method . we obtain that the mass splittings among these states is around @xmath8 .",
