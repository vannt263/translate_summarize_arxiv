    "<S> this is expected as @xmath74 represents the `` kinetic energy '' of quantum fluctuations in the system , thus it should be finite in all phases . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the data indicates that in the limit of @xmath72 this quantity is the same on all bonds of the unit cell of the kagome lattice , meaning that there is no breaking of space - group symmetry ( see supplemental information ) .     </S>",
    "<S> * exponential decay of correlation functions . * the off - diagonal spin correlation function as a function of distance along the @xmath75 direction for a system with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line corresponds to a fit of the numerical data to the function @xmath78,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    finally , since the above data suggests the existence of a phase that is homogeneous , disordered , and quantum - mechanically fluctuating at extremely low temperatures , one should also examine whether the energy for excitations out of this ground state is gapped or gapless . </S>",
    "<S> although a direct measurement of the gap is not possible in this type of sse qmc method , we can indirectly probe its existence by looking at the decay of real - space correlations . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : corrf ] , we compare the decay of single - particle correlations between the @xmath79 magnetization lobes , and the adjacent fm ordered phase . for </S>",
    "<S> the system size studied , it is clear that that correlations in the lobe are consistent with exponential decay , and therefore indicative of a gap . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the fm phase the correlations quickly reach a finite value , indicating symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the diagonal part of the spin correlation function is consistent with exponential decay both in the lobes and in the fm phase ( not illustrated ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , our qmc results have elucidated a phase diagram for our kagome pseudo - spin xyz model ( with @xmath21 ) which contains a predominant fm phase , surrounding `` lobes '' of an exotic disordered @xmath79 magnetization phase . since our dual gauge theory ( detailed in the supplemental information ) </S>",
    "<S> indicates that these lobes may realize a qsl with an emergent @xmath0 gauge symmetry , it is clear that further simulation work should be carried out to address this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> to confirm the presence of a @xmath0 qsl , one requires evidence of either excitations consistent with this gauge structure ( e.g.  magnetic spinons or non - magnetic visons at non - zero temperature ) , or a smoking gun such as the topological entanglement entropy.@xcite such evidence , although demonstrated in the past with sse qmc,@xcite is resource - intensive to obtain , requiring high numerical precision at very low temperatures , and thus outside of the scope of the present manuscript .    </S>",
    "<S> however , we also note that , due to the presence of only a discrete symmetry in our kagome @xmath80 model , an emergent @xmath0 structure is not strictly required by the lieb - schultz - mattis - hastings ( lsmh ) theorem,@xcite which states that a system with half - odd - integer spin in the unit cell can not have a gap _ and _ a unique ground state . in higher - symmetry hamiltonians , </S>",
    "<S> the requirements of the lsmh theorem are satisfied in a gapped qsl phase by the _ topological _ </S>",
    "<S> degeneracy , which is a consequence of the emergent discrete gauge symmetry . for our hamiltonian with a gapped qsl arising in a model with only global discrete symmetries , </S>",
    "<S> an emergent gauge structure is not required . </S>",
    "<S> rather , it is possible that the groundstate is a quantum paramagnet . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> other types of emergent gauge structure , topological order , or other exotic phenomena are theoretically possible . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the nature of this hamiltonian , which is among the first to show a 2d qsl phase with only nearest - neighbor interactions , lends itself exceedingly well to study by sign - problem - free qmc simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect a large number of studies in the near future will help elucidate the precise nature of this qsl phase .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-3 ] ]    through extensive quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations , we have studied a sign - problem - free model of frustrated quantum spins interacting on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) kagome lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this model is decedent from a more general quantum xyz hamiltonian discussed by huang , chen and hermele,@xcite derived for the three - dimensional pyrochlore lattice , when subject to a magnetic field along the [ 111 ] crystalographic direction . for a large range of hamiltonian parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the qmc data uncovers an exotic disordered phase which breaks no symmetries , has strong quantum mechanical fluctuations and exponentially decaying correlations  a gapped quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery is consistent with an analytical dual gauge theory ( detailed in the supplemental information ) , which indicates that , in the limit of small quantum fluctuations , the phase could be a 2d qsl with an emergent @xmath0 gauge symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> our work suggests a new experimental avenue to search for the highly - coveted qsl phase in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> previous efforts have focussed largely on su(2 ) hamiltonains on kagome or triangular lattice materials.@xcite in contrast , we propose to concentrate the search on the quantum spin ice pyrochlore materials , subject to an external field along the [ 111 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> such kagome ice phases have been identified in various materials in the past </S>",
    "<S> . a closer look at several quantum spin ice candidates is warranted , particularly in materials where strong quantum fluctuations are known to exist , such as tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , pr@xmath1zr@xmath1o@xmath2 , and pr@xmath1sn@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> also , in light of recent experiments@xcite which suggest that the oft - studied classical spin ice state is only metastable in dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , it would seem prudent to re - examine the kagome ice state of this material using similar long - timescale techniques , to ascertain whether evidence of a qsl state may be present yet dynamically inhibited in the short - timescale studies performed to date . </S>"
