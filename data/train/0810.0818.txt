    "<S> within the context of born - infeld ( bi ) nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) we revisit the h - atom . born s integral expression for the electrostatic potential is simulated by the morse type potential with remarkable fit . </S>",
    "<S> the morse potential is employed to determine both the ground state energy of the electron and the bi parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the first example of nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) was introduced in 1934 by born and infeld ( bi ) in order to eliminate divergences in the coulomb problem @xcite . with the advent of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , however , divergences were resolved by the well - established scheme of renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> being popular enough , qed suppressed the efforts of bi to the extend of being forgotten until very recent decade . </S>",
    "<S> we observe now that bi theory gained recognition anew within string theory ; a theory that aims to unify all forces of nature , including quantum gravity , under a common title . </S>",
    "<S> once bi paved the way toward ned , various modifications emerged as alternative theories to the well - known linear electrodynamics of maxwell . </S>",
    "<S> the common feature in all these ned theories is that in the linear limit it recovers the maxwell s electrodynamics , as it should . </S>",
    "<S> the ned lagrangian is commonly constructed from the invariants @xmath0 and @xmath1(@xmath2 means dual ) as non - polynomial functions . since these invariants determine the vacuum polarization bi theory , or any version of ned serves to polarize the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> vanishing of these invariants , in plane waves for example , exempts the latter as polarizer of the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we note that beside string theory , ned and naturally bi , find applications in different areas , ranging from black holes and cosmology to the model of elementary particles@xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the born s intricate solution and employ a morse type of potential simulation to determine the ground level energy of the h - atom . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves entirely to the pure electrical potential ( i.e. without magnetic fields ) applied to the ground state of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic bi lagrangian is given by @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the bi parameter . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit @xmath6  we recover the maxwell lagrangian @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic potential is given by@xmath8 for an @xmath9 dependent function @xmath10 the sourceless bi equation is @xmath11 in which @xmath12 refers to the square root of determinant for the spherically symmetric flat metric@xmath13 born s solution follows from ( 3 ) as an indefinite integral @xmath14 in which we note that the lower limit of integral must be changed according to the location of the electron , i.e. the location of delta function fixes the lower limit while the upper limit is infinite .    </S>",
    "<S> h. carley and m. k .- h . </S>",
    "<S> kiessling @xcite have shown recently that bi effects @xcite on the schrdinger spectrum of the ideal h - atom ( i.e. a spinless electron bound to an infinitely massive point proton ) can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose they used the following modified coulomb potential ( born - infeld - coulomb ( bic ) potential ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is only a function of @xmath17 from @xcite , @xmath16 is explicitly given by the following integral form @xmath18 in which @xmath19 indicates euler s beta function , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is born s electromagnetic vacuum constant . for simplicity , we also follow the units accepted in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite i.e. , units of @xmath22 for both action and angular momentum , electron charge @xmath23 for charge , electron rest mass @xmath24 for mass , speed of light @xmath25 for velocity , and compton wavelength of the electron @xmath26 for both length and time . in these units , </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation of an electron which undergoes the potential ( 6 ) , becomes@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fine structure constant , @xmath9 is the distance of the electron from the origin ( proton ) in terms of compton wavelength of electron @xmath29 and @xmath30 is eigenenergy of the system in terms of the electron rest energy . in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath31 versus @xmath32 which shows that @xmath33 @xmath34 a maximum occurs at @xmath35 and @xmath36 the asymptotic behavior of @xmath37 manifests that either for a finite @xmath5 and extremely large @xmath9 or for a finite @xmath9 and extremely small @xmath5 , born - infeld interaction gives the usual coulomb potential .    </S>",
    "<S> now let s consider bic s potential as@xmath38 where @xmath39 is only a function of @xmath32 and explicitly @xmath40 we plot @xmath41 as a function of @xmath32 in fig.2 ( this figure is also given by @xcite ) which clearly reveals that bic s potential is finite at the origin .    here </S>",
    "<S> although the latter function may not be easily expressed in a closed form we simulate it into some familiar functions to represent @xmath42 in the process of analytical solution of the schrdinger equation ( 8) .    </S>",
    "<S> first we try to map @xmath41 into a morse - type - potential@xcite in the form of @xmath43\\ ] ] where @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 are four adjusting parameters . in fig.3 we plot the original @xmath41 and a simulated version of @xmath41 ( let s call it @xmath48 ) after setting @xmath49 one may notice that for the given interval of @xmath32 in the fig.3 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) this is a very well matched simulation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a simple calculation shows that within order of @xmath51 for the size of h - atom , having @xmath50 restricts @xmath52 to be greater than one .    </S>",
    "<S> continuing the solution of ( 8) , after usual separation of variables , the radial part of the schrdinger equation ( 8) reads , ( @xmath53state ) @xmath54 where @xmath48 is given by ( 11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we impose the following change of variables @xmath55 to get@xmath56   u\\left (   \\rho\\right ) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\alpha^{2}}\\left (   \\alpha\\beta\\right )   ^{2}u\\left ( \\rho\\right )   .\\ ] ] the latter equation , by introducing @xmath57 yields@xmath58 where @xmath59   < 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that since @xmath60 then @xmath61 in which infinity is in contrast with the dimension of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> also we note that this is ( an energy - dependent - potential ) schrdinger equation and therefore in the solution we identify @xmath62 ( consequently @xmath63 and @xmath64 simultaneously@xmath65 one can show that the proper solution which satisfies the boundary conditions@xmath66 is given by@xmath67 in which @xmath68 and whittakerm@xmath69 in fact here @xmath70 is not a quantum number but it is a new parameter and we shall use it to adjust the results , and @xmath71 is the first root of whittakerm@xmath72 it is remarkable to observe that once we choose @xmath70 , we identify both potential and energy of the system at the same time </S>",
