    "the proximity catch digraphs ( pcds ) were motivated by their applications in pattern classification and spatial pattern analysis , hence they have become focus of considerable attention recently .",
    "the pcds are a special type of proximity graphs which were introduced by @xcite .",
    "a _ digraph _ is a directed graph with vertex set @xmath0 and arcs ( directed edges ) each of which is from one vertex to another based on a binary relation .",
    "then the pair @xmath1 is an ordered pair which stands for an _ arc _ from vertex @xmath2 to vertex @xmath3 in @xmath0 .",
    "for example , _",
    "nearest neighbor ( di)graph _ which is defined by placing an arc between each vertex and its nearest neighbor is a proximity digraph where vertices represent points in some metric space ( @xcite ) .",
    "pcds are _ data - random digraphs _ in which each vertex corresponds to a data point and arcs are defined in terms of some bivariate relation on the data",
    ".    the pcds are closely related to the class cover problem of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be a measurable space and @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two sets of @xmath7-valued random variables from classes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , with joint probability distribution @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be any distance function .",
    "the _ class cover problem _ for a target class , say @xmath8 , refers to finding a collection of neighborhoods , @xmath12 around @xmath13 such that ( i ) @xmath14 and ( ii ) @xmath15 .",
    "a collection of neighborhoods satisfying both conditions is called a _",
    "class cover_. a cover satisfying ( i ) is a _ proper cover _ of @xmath16 while a cover satisfying ( ii ) is a _ pure cover _ relative to @xmath17 .",
    "this article is on the _ cardinality of smallest class covers _ ; that is , class covers satisfying both ( i ) and ( ii ) with the smallest number of neighborhoods .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more on the class cover problem .",
    "the first type of pcd was class cover catch digraph ( cccd ) introduced by @xcite who gave the exact distribution of its domination number for uniform data from two classes in @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite extended the cccds to higher dimensions and demonstrated that cccds are a competitive alternative to the existing methods in classification .",
    "furthermore , @xcite proved a slln result for the one - dimensional class cover problem ; @xcite provided a generalized slln result and @xcite provided a clt result for cccd based on one - dimensional data .",
    "however , cccds have some disadvantages in higher dimensions ; namely , finding the minimum dominating set for cccds is an np - hard problem in general , although a simple linear time algorithm is available for one dimensional data ( @xcite ) ; and the exact and the asymptotic distributions of the domination number of the cccds are not analytically tractable in multiple dimensions .",
    "@xcite introduced the central similarity proximity maps and proportional - edge proximity maps for data in @xmath19 with @xmath20 and the associated random pcds with the purpose of avoiding the above mentioned problems .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of the proportional - edge pcd is calculated for data in @xmath21 and then the domination number is used as a statistic for testing bivariate spatial patterns ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative density of these two pcd families is also calculated and used for the same purpose ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the distribution of the domination number of cccds is derived for non - uniform data ( @xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we provide the exact ( and asymptotic ) distribution of the domination number of proportional - edge pcds for uniform ( and non - uniform ) one - dimensional data .",
    "first , some special cases and bounds for the domination number of proportional - edge pcds is presented , then the domination number is investigated for uniform data in one interval ( in @xmath18 ) and the analysis is generalized to uniform data in multiple intervals and to non - uniform data in one and multiple intervals .",
    "these results can be seen as generalizations of the results of @xcite .",
    "some trivial proofs are omitted , shorter proofs are given in the main body of the article ; while longer proofs are deferred to the appendix .",
    "we define the proportional - edge pcds and their domination number in section [ sec : prop - edge - pcd ] , provide the exact and asymptotic distributions of the domination number of proportional - edge pcds for uniform data in one interval in section [ sec : gamma - dist - uniform ] , discuss the distribution of the domination number for data from a general distribution in section [ sec : non - uniform ] .",
    "we extend these results to multiple intervals in section [ sec : dist - multiple - intervals ] , and provide discussion and conclusions in section [ sec : disc - conclusions ] . for convenience in notation and presentation , we resort to non - standard extended ( perhaps abused ) forms of bernoulli and binomial distributions , denoted @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath2 is the probability of success and @xmath24 is the number of trials . throughout the article , we take @xmath25 $ ] ( unlike @xmath26 ) and if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 and @xmath29 . if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 for @xmath26 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
