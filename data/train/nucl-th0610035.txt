    "this paper is based on our recent analysis @xcite of the event - by - event fluctuations of the mean transverse - momentum measured by phenix @xcite and star @xcite collaborations at rhic .",
    "the discussed new data has extended our knowledge of the phenomena studied intensely in recent years @xcite .",
    "one of the central issues in this field is whether the @xmath0 fluctuations at intermediate momenta result from jets @xcite . in this paper",
    "we argue that the observed scaling of strength of dynamical fluctuations may be naturally explained by formation of multiparticle clusters . from our point of view",
    ", the explanation of the data in terms of quenched jets represents only one possible option , other physical mechanisms leading to clustering also explain the data .    our reasoning is based on the following three observations : @xmath1 )  the mean and the variance of the inclusive momentum distribution are practically constant at low centrality parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath4 )  the variance of the average momenta for the mixed events is practically equal to the variance of the inclusive distribution divided by the average multiplicity , @xmath5 finally , @xmath6 )  the difference of the experimental and mixed - event variances of mean @xmath0 , denoted as @xmath7 , scales as inverse multiplicity @xmath8    as mentioned above , an explanation of this scaling can be provided by clustering in the expansion velocity .",
    "moreover , the extracted value of @xmath9 is large at the expected scale provided by the variance of @xmath0 , which indicates that the clusters should contain at least several particles in order to combinatorically enhance the magnitude to the observed level .",
    "this point is supported by the numerical calculations of the values of @xmath7 coming from the resonance decays and from thermal clusters in statistical models of heavy - ion collisions , which show that these values are very small @xcite .",

    "in this section we present elementary statistical considerations which form the basis of our treatment of the fluctuations .",
    "we use the notation where the letter @xmath13 denotes @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the value of @xmath13 for the @xmath1th particle , and @xmath16 is the mean transverse momentum in an event of multiplicity @xmath17 . consider events of multiplicity @xmath17 and transverse momenta @xmath18 .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath17 and the momenta are varying randomly from event to event .",
    "the probability density of occurrence of a given momentum configuration is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the multiplicity distribution and @xmath21 is the conditional probability distribution of occurrence of @xmath22 in accepted events , provided we have the multiplicity @xmath17 .",
    "note that in general @xmath23 depends functionally on @xmath17 , as indicated by the subscript .",
    "the normalization is @xmath24 the _ marginal _ probability densities are defined as @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "these are also normalized to unity , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) .",
    "since the number of arguments distinguishes the marginal distributions @xmath27 , in the following we drop the superscript @xmath28 .",
    "further , we introduce the following definitions @xmath29 the subscript @xmath17 indicates that the averaging is taken in samples of multiplicity @xmath17 .",
    "we note in passing that the commonly used _",
    "inclusive _ distributions are related to the marginal probability distributions in the following way : @xmath30 which are normalized to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . for the variable @xmath33",

    "at first we discuss the phenix measurement @xcite of the event - by - event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum at @xmath36  gev .",
    "we use the experimental fact that the variance of the momentum distribution and its mean are independent of centrality ( in the considered range ) , which allows us to replace the quantities @xmath37 by @xmath38 and @xmath39 by @xmath40 at the average multiplicity , denoted as @xmath41 . in this way",

    "comparison made in table [ tab : data ] , see the 8th and 9th rows , shows that formula ( [ mixed ] ) works at the @xmath46 level .",
    "in addition , since @xmath47 is not altered by the event mixing procedure , subtracting ( [ mixed ] ) from ( [ central ] ) yields @xmath48",
    "the scaling of the dynamical fluctuations with @xmath31 , see the last row of table [ tab : data ] and eq .",
    "( [ scaledyn ] ) , may be regarded as a constraint restricting the behavior of the covariance term .",
    "for instance , one can immediately conclude that if all particles were correlated to each other , @xmath49 would be proportional to the number of pairs , and @xmath9 would not depend on @xmath31 at large multiplicities .",
    "a natural explanation of the scaling ( [ scaledyn ] ) comes from the cluster model , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : clust ] . the system is assumed to have @xmath50 clusters , each containing ( on the average ) @xmath35 particles .",
    "below we keep @xmath51 for simplicity ( a more general case is discussed in ref .",
    "the particles are correlated if and only if they belong to the same cluster , where the covariance per pair is @xmath52 .",
    "the number of correlated pairs within a cluster is @xmath53 .",
    "some particles may be unclustered , hence the ratio of clustered to all particles is @xmath54 . if all particles are clustered then @xmath55 . with these assumptions eq .",
    "( [ dyn ] ) becomes @xmath56 which complies to the scaling ( [ scaledyn ] ) .",
    "an immediate conclusion here is that the ratio @xmath57 can not depend on @xmath31 ( in the considered centrality range , @xmath58 ) in order for the scaling to hold .",
    "the question now is whether we can use the above results to draw conclusions on effects of jets ( minijets ) , which have been proposed as a possible explanation of the experimental data even at the considered soft momenta @xcite .",
    "jets , when fragmenting , lead to clusters in the momentum space .",
    "the resulting full covariance from jets is then @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the number of clusters originating from jets , @xmath61 is the average number of particles in the cluster , and @xmath62 is the average covariance per pair .",
    "the total number of particles produced from jets is @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the commonly accepted estimate of the dependence of @xmath63 on centrality is accounted for by the nuclear modification factor @xmath64 multiplied by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisons @xmath65 . since @xmath64 depends on the ratio @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the multiplicity in the proton - proton collisions , in a given @xmath0 bin one finds @xmath68 which complies to the scaling of eq .",
    "( [ cluster ] ) .",
    "the observed scaling of the dynamical fluctuations of mean transverse - momentum may be naturally explained by the cluster model .",
    "we emphasize that the scaling follows from the presence of clusters only , and is insensitive to the nature of their physical origin as long as one imposes the condition @xmath69 .",
    "the explanation of the observed data in terms of quenched jets agrees with the cluster picture .",
    "however , the explanation of the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 fluctuations in terms of jets based solely on eq .",
