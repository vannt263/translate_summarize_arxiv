    "with the advent of the internet , the exponential growth of the world - wide - web and routers confront people with an information overload @xcite .",
    "we are facing too much data to be able to effectively filter out the pieces of information that are most appropriate for us .",
    "a promising way is to provide personal recommendations to filter out the information .",
    "recommendation systems use the opinions of users to help them more effectively identify content of interest from a potentially overwhelming set of choices @xcite . motivated by the practical significance to the e - commerce and society , various kinds of algorithms have been proposed , such as correlation - based methods @xcite , content - based methods @xcite , the spectral analysis @xcite , principle component analysis @xcite , network - based methods @xcite , and so on . for a review of current progress , see ref . @xcite and the references therein .",
    "one of the most successful technologies for recommendation systems , called _ collaborative filtering _ ( cf ) , has been developed and extensively investigated over the past decade @xcite .",
    "when predicting the potential interests of a given user , such approach first identifies a set of similar users from the past records and then makes a prediction based on the weighted combination of those similar users opinions . despite its wide applications , collaborative filtering suffers from several major limitations including system scalability and accuracy @xcite",
    "recently , some physical dynamics , including mass diffusion @xcite , heat conduction @xcite and trust - based model @xcite , have found their applications in personal recommendations .",
    "these physical approaches have been demonstrated to be of both high accuracy and low computational complexity @xcite",
    ". however , the algorithmic accuracy and computational complexity may be very sensitive to the statistics of data sets .",
    "for example , the algorithm presented in ref .",
    "@xcite runs much faster than standard cf if the number of users is much larger than that of objects , while when the number of objects is huge , the advantage of this algorithm vanishes because its complexity is mainly determined by the number of objects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in order to increase the system scalability and accuracy of standard cf",
    ", we introduce a network - based recommendation algorithm with spreading activation , namely sa - cf .",
    "in addition , two free parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are presented to increase the accuracy and personality .",
    "denoting the object set as @xmath2 and user set as @xmath3 = @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 , a recommendation system can be fully described by an adjacent matrix @xmath7 , where @xmath8 if @xmath9 is collected by @xmath10 , and @xmath11 otherwise . for a given user ,",
    "a recommendation algorithm generates a ranking of all the objects he / she has not collected before .",
    "based on the user - object matrix @xmath12 , a user similarity network can be constructed , where each node represents a user , and two users are connected if and only if they have collected at least one common object . in the standard cf , the similarity between @xmath13 and @xmath10 can be evaluated directly by a correlation function : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the degree of user @xmath13 . inspired by the diffusion process presented by zhou _",
    "@xcite , we assume a certain amount of resource ( e.g. recommendation power ) is associated with each user , and the weight @xmath16 represents the proportion of the resource , which @xmath10 would like to distribute to @xmath13 . following a network - based resource - allocation process @xcite where each user distributes his / her initial resource equally to all the objects",
    "he / she has collected , and then each object sends back what it has received to all the users collected it , the weight @xmath16 ( the fraction of initial resource @xmath10 eventually gives to @xmath13 ) can be expressed as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the degree object @xmath19 . using the spreading process ,",
    "the user correlation network can be constructed , whose edge weight is obtained by eq .",
    "( [ equation2 ] ) . for the user - object pair @xmath20 ,",
    "if @xmath13 has not yet collected @xmath21 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) , the predicted score , @xmath23 , is given as @xmath24 from the definition of eq.([equation1 ] ) , one can get that , to a target user , all of his neighbors collection information would affect the recommendation results , which is different with the definition reachability @xcite . based on the definitions of @xmath16 and @xmath23 , sa - cf can be given .",
    "the framework of the algorithm is organized as follows : ( i ) calculate the user similarity matrix @xmath25 based on the spreading approach ; ( ii ) for each user @xmath26 , obtain the score @xmath23 on every object not being yet collected by @xmath27 ; ( iii ) sort the uncollected objects in descending order of @xmath23 , and those in the top will be recommended .",
    "to test the algorithmic accuracy and personality , we use a benchmark data - set , namely _ movielens _ @xcite .",
    "the data consists of 1682 movies ( objects ) and 943 users , who vote movies using discrete ratings 1 - 5 .",
    "hence we applied the coarse - graining method previously used in refs .",
    "@xcite : a movie is set to be collected by a user only if the giving rating is larger than 2 .",
    "the original data contains @xmath28 ratings , 85.25% of which are @xmath29 , thus the user - object ( user - movie ) bipartite network after the coarse gaining contains 85250 edges . to test the recommendation algorithms , the data set",
    "is randomly divided into two parts : the training set contains 90% of the data , and the remaining 10% of data constitutes the probe . the training set is treated as known information , while no information in the probe set is allowed to be used for prediction .",
    "a recommendation algorithm should provide each user with an ordered queue of all its uncollected objects .",
    "it should be emphasized that , the length of queue should not be given artificially , because of the fact that the number of uncollected movies for different users are different .",
    "for an arbitrary user @xmath13 , if the relation @xmath13-@xmath21 is in the probe set ( according to the training set , @xmath21 is an uncollected object for @xmath13 ) , we measure the position of @xmath21 in the ordered queue .",
    "for example , if there are @xmath30 uncollected movies for @xmath13 , and @xmath21 is the 10th from the top , we say the position of @xmath21 is @xmath31 , denoted by @xmath32 . since the probe entries are actually collected by users , a good algorithm is expected to give high recommendations to them , thus leading to small @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the mean value of the position @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( called _ ranking score _",
    "@xcite ) , averaged over all the entries in the probe , can be used to evaluate the algorithmic accuracy : the smaller the ranking score , the higher the algorithmic accuracy , and vice verse . implementing the sa - cf and cf @xcite ,",
    "the average value of ranking score are @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite . clearly , under the simplest initial configuration , subject to the algorithmic accuracy ,",
    "the sa - cf algorithm outperforms the standard cf .    [ 1.0 ] vs. @xmath0 .",
    "the black solid and red dash curves represent the performances of sa - cf and cf , respectively .",
    "all the data points are obtained by averaging over ten independent runs with different data - set divisions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 1.0 ] vs. @xmath0 .",
    "the black solid , red dashed and green dotted curves represent the cases with typical length @xmath37 and 50 , respectively .",
    "the blue dot line corresponds to the optimal value @xmath38 .",
    "all the data points are obtained by averaging over ten independent runs with different data - set divisions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 1.0 ] vs. @xmath0 .",

    "all the data points are obtained by averaging over ten independent runs with different data - set divisions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 1.0 ] vs. @xmath1 .",
    "the inset shows the relation for larger @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , when @xmath1 approaches @xmath39 , the algorithmic accuracy is the same as that of the sa - cf with @xmath40 .",
    "all the data points are obtained by averaging over ten independent runs with different data - set divisions .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in order to further improve the algorithmic accuracy , we propose two modified methods . similar to the ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the potential role of object degree may give better performance .",
    "accordingly , instead of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we introduce a more complicated way to get user - user correlation : @xmath41 where @xmath0 is a tunable parameter .",
    "when @xmath42 , this method degenerates to the algorithm mentioned in the last section .",
    "the case with @xmath43 weakens the contribution of large - degree objects to the user - user correlation , while @xmath44 will enhance the contribution of large - degree objects .",
    "according to our daily experience , if two users @xmath13 and @xmath10 has simultaneously collected a very popular object ( with very large degree ) , it does nt mean that their interests are similar ; on the contrary , if two users both collected an unpopular object ( with very small degree ) , it is very likely that they share some common and particular tastes .",
    "therefore , we expect a larger @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) will lead to higher accuracy than the routine case @xmath42 .",
    "fig.[fig1.1 ] reports the algorithmic accuracy as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the curve has a clear minimum around @xmath45 , which strongly support the above statement .",
    "compared with the routine case ( @xmath42 ) , the ranking score can be further reduced by 11.2% at the optimal value .",
    "it is indeed a great improvement for recommendation algorithms .",
    "besides accuracy , the average degree of all recommended movies @xmath46 and the mean value of hamming distance @xmath47 @xcite are taken in account to measure the algorithmic personality .",
    "the movies with higher degrees are more popular than the ones with smaller degrees",
    ". the personal recommendation should give small @xmath46 to fit the special tastes of different users .",
    "fig.[fig1.2 ] reports the average degree of all recommended movies as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "one can see from fig.[fig1.2 ] that the average degree is negatively correlated with @xmath0 , thus depressing the recommendation power of high - degree objects gives more opportunity to the unpopular objects .",
    "the hamming distance , @xmath48 , is defined by the mean value among any two recommended lists of @xmath13 and @xmath10 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the list length and @xmath51 is the overlapped number of objects in the two users recommended lists .",
    "fig.[fig1.3 ] shows the positively correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath0 , in according with the simulation results in fig.[fig1.2 ] , which indicates that depressing the influence of high - degree objects makes the recommendations more personal .",
    "the above simulation results indicate that sa - cf outperforms cf from the viewpoints of accuracy and personality .    besides the algorithmic accuracy and personality , the computational complexity should also be taken into account . actually , we argue that a better algorithm should simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy .",
    "note that , the computational complexity of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is very high if the number of user , @xmath52 , is huge . actually , the majority of user - user similarities are very small , which contribute little to the final recommendation",
    ". however , those inconsequential items , corresponding to the less similar users , dominate the computational time of eq . ( 3 ) . therefore , we propose a modified algorithm , so - called top-@xmath1 sa - cf , which only considers the @xmath1 most similar users information to any given user .",
    "that is to say , in the top-@xmath1 sa - cf , the sum in eq .",
    "( 3 ) runs over only the @xmath1 most similar users of @xmath13 . in the process of calculation",
    "the similarity matrix @xmath16 , to each other , we can simultaneously record its most similar users . when @xmath53 , the additional computing time for top-@xmath1 similar users are remarkably shorter than what we can save from the traditional calculation of eq .",
    "( 3 ) . more",
    "surprisingly , as shown in fig.[fig1.4 ] , with properly chosen @xmath1 , this algorithm not only reduces the computation , but also enhances the algorithmic accuracy .",
    "this property is of practical significance , especially for the huge - size recommender systems . from figures [ fig1.2 ] and [ fig1.3 ]",
    ", one can find that , to the same @xmath0 range , the anticorrelations between @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath0 are different in different @xmath0 range .",
    "maybe there is a phase transition in the anticorrelations . because this paper mainly focuses on the accuracy and personality of the recommendation algorithms , this issue",
    "would be investigated in the future .",
    "in this paper , the spreading activation approach is presented to compute the user similarity of the collaborative filtering algorithm , named sa - cf .",
    "the basic sa - cf has obviously higher accuracy than the standard cf .",
    "ignoring the degree - degree correlation in user - object relations , the algorithmic complexity of sa - cf is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the average degree of users and objects . correspondingly , the algorithmic complexity of the standard cf is @xmath57 , where the first term accounts for the calculation of similarity between users , and the second term accounts for the calculation of the predictions . in reality , the number of users , @xmath52 , is much larger than the average object degree , @xmath56 , therefore , the computational complexity of sa - cf is much less than that of the standard cf .",
    "the sa - cf has great potential significance in practice .",
    "furthermore , we proposed two modified algorithms based on sa - cf .",
    "the first algorithm weakens the contribution of large - degree objects to user - user correlations , and the second one eliminates the influence of less similar users .",
    "both the two modified algorithm can further enhance the accuracy of sa - cf .",
    "more significantly , with properly choice of the parameter @xmath1 , top-@xmath1 sa - cf can simultaneously reduces the computational complexity and improves the algorithmic accuracy .",
    "a natural question on the presented algorithms is whether these algorithms are robust to other data - sets or random recommendation ?",
    "to sa - cf , the answer is yes , because it would get the user similarity more accurately . while to the two modified algorithms ,",
    "the answer is no . since both of the two modified algorithms introduced the tunable parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the optimal values of different data - sets are different .",
    "the further work would focus on how to find an effective way to obtain the optimal value exactly , then the modified algorithms could be implemented more easily .",
