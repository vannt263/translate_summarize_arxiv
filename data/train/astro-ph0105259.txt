    "the growing number of gamma - ray bursts with redshifts has not only established that most , if not all , bursts are at cosmological distances , and that up to @xmath0 erg are radiated by a burst , but permits us to determine important intrinsic physical distributions . since we sample a burst s radiation pattern at only one point , the observed energy fluence can only be related to the energy flux emitted in our direction ; this energy flux can be expressed as the total energy the burst would have emitted if it radiated isotropically .",
    "here i consider the distribution of this apparent total energy .",
    "the distribution of the apparent total energy is a convolution of the distribution of the actual energy emitted and the distribution of the angle into which the emission is beamed , both quantities of crucial importance in understanding the physics of the progenitor , the frequency of burst occurrence , and the impact of a burst on its environment .",
    "frail et al . (",
    "2001 ) have recently determined the beaming angles for a burst sample by modeling the late - time breaks in the temporal decay of the afterglows ; accounting for the beaming angle provides the actual total energy , which they found is clustered around @xmath1 erg . if the analysis of frail et al .",
    "is indeed correct ( there are competing models for the evolution of the afterglow ) then methods similar to those i develop here will be necessary to determine properly the beaming angle and total energy distributions .",
    "this study extends the work of jimenez , band & piran ( 2001 ) which considered lognormal distributions for the apparent total gamma - ray energy , the peak gamma - ray luminosity , and the total x - ray afterglow energy .",
    "jimenez et al . expanded the database of bursts with spectroscopic redshifts by adding bursts for which a redshift probability distribution could be inferred from the host galaxy brightness .",
    "currently the bursts with only redshift probability distributions do not augment the relevant burst database sufficiently to warrant their inclusion in my study , although in the future it may be advantageous to include these bursts if the determination of spectroscopic redshifts does not keep pace with the detection of bursts and their host galaxies .",
    "recently correlations have been proposed between burst properties and their peak luminosities .",
    "norris , marani & bonnel ( 1999 ) proposed that more luminous bursts have smaller time lags between energy channels , while fenimore & ramirez - ruiz ( 2001 ) reported that the light curves of more luminous bursts were more variable ; schaefer , deng & band ( 2001 ) found that applying both correlations to the same burst sample resulted in consistent burst luminosities .",
    "the redshift is determined from the derived luminosities and the observed peak fluxes .",
    "thus these correlations can give us a large burst sample with redshifts from which the energy distribution can be determined .    in  2",
    "i discuss the methodology for finding the best parameter values for a given functional form of the distribution , and for comparing different functional forms .",
    "i also evaluate the sensitivity to small burst samples , and demonstrate the importance of considering the detection threshold in determining the distributions .",
    "the energy distributions resulting from two small burst samples with spectroscopic redshifts and from a large sample with redshifts from the variability - luminosity correlation are described in  3 . finally , ",
    "4 summarizes my conclusions .",
    "i begin with an assumed distribution @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the apparent total burst energy , @xmath4 is the set of parameters which characterize the @xmath5th model distribution function represented by @xmath6 , and @xmath7 specifies general assumptions about the distribution function .",
    "i use @xmath8 to mean the probability of @xmath9 given @xmath10 . below",
    "i present the distribution functions used in this study .",
    "a distribution is assumed to be universal and not a function of redshift ( i.e. , no evolution ) , or of properties of the host galaxy , burst , etc . of course , once a sufficiently large sample is available , the energy distributions for burst subsets can be investigated .",
    "i use normalized distributions since the burst rate is not of interest here .",
    "the observed energy fluence @xmath11 and the burst energy @xmath3 are related by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the luminosity distance .",
    "it is in calculating the luminosity distance that the burst redshift and a cosmological model are required . here",
    "i assume h@xmath14=65 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this energy distribution is converted into @xmath18 , the probability of obtaining the energy fluence @xmath11 given the parameters @xmath4 for model @xmath6 , the burst redshift @xmath19 , and other assumptions @xmath7 ( e.g. , the choice of cosmological model ) .",
    "however , the observed fluences are not drawn from this probability distribution but from @xmath20 , the normalized distribution which is truncated below @xmath21 , the minimum fluence at which that particular burst would have been included in the burst sample .",
    "i now form the likelihood @xmath22 where the @xmath23th burst has energy fluence @xmath24 , threshold fluence @xmath25 , and redshift @xmath26 . in the `` frequentist '' framework best fit parameters",
    "are typically found by maximizing @xmath27 .",
    "the likelihood is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the set of observed fluences and fluence thresholds .",
    "the bayesian method of estimating the parameters is to calculate @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the prior for the parameters @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath32 is sharply peaked , then the expectation value of the parameters occurs at the peak of @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath33 is the likelihood in eq .  1 times the priors for the parameters .",
    "in some sense the priors indicate the natural variables in terms of which the priors are constant .",
    "for example , here the burst energies vary over a number of decades , and thus i assume that the priors for average or cutoff energies are logarithmic . consequently maximizing @xmath33 is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood in terms of the logarithm of the energy parameters .",
    "this is the methodology i use here ; i do not attempt to integrate the integrals in eq .  2 .    for each burst",
    "the cumulative probability is @xmath34 if the assumed energy distribution function is an acceptable characterization of the observations ( which would be the case if the model @xmath6 is correct ) and all the assumptions are valid ( e.g. , the cosmological model is correct ) , then the cumulative probabilities @xmath35 should be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , and have an average value of @xmath36 for @xmath37 bursts in the sample .      as mentioned above",
    ", the average of the cumulative probability @xmath38 should be 1/2 ( within a quantifiable uncertainty ) if the distribution function describes the observations satisfactorily .",
    "thus the value of this statistic for model @xmath6 is a measure of the acceptability of that model .",
    "further , a comparison of the values for different models is a measure of the relative merits of these models ; of course , this comparison should account for the expected uncertainty in the value of this statistic .",
    "the bayesian framework provides a clear prescription for comparing models through the odds ratio .",
    "let @xmath39 be the posterior probability for the @xmath5th model @xmath6 given the data @xmath29 .",
    "then the odds ratio comparing the @xmath5th and @xmath40th models is @xmath41 .",
    "but by bayes theorem @xmath42 where the normalizing factor is independent of @xmath6 , and thus cancels in forming the odds ratio .",
    "i assume that no model is favored a priori ; therefore the `` priors '' @xmath43 are the same for all @xmath6 , and cancel in forming the odds ratio . here",
    "consists of the observed energy fluences ( and the detection thresholds ) .",
    "thus @xmath44 . however , we begin with the more fundamental probabilities @xmath45 , which are functions of the model parameters @xmath4 . in determining the preferred model we are uninterested in the specific model parameters , and therefore we `` marginalize '' over the parameters @xmath4 : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the prior for the parameters of the @xmath5th model .",
    "thus @xmath48 it will be noted that the odds ratio is the ratio of the likelihoods for each model ( eq .  1 ) marginalized over the model parameters . often the prior for the parameters",
    "is set equal to a delta function at the parameter values which maximize the likelihood , which is of course circular reasoning . in this common formulation ,",
    "the odds ratio is the ratio of the peak values of the likelihoods for each model .",
    "below i present priors defined in terms of the expected parameter ranges , in which case the integrals in eq .",
    "4 must be integrated .",
    "i present values of the odds ratio with both the delta function priors and the more refined priors .",
    "it is possible that with the delta function priors the odds ratio may favor one model , but with the more refined priors another model is favored , as is indeed the case here .",
    "i assume that @xmath3 has a log - normal distribution @xmath49 d(\\ln e ) \\quad .\\ ] ] thus the fluence @xmath11 also has a log - normal distribution .",
    "note that @xmath50 is a width in logarithmic space , and the linear change of variables from @xmath3 to @xmath11 does not affect this width .",
    "as discussed above , we need to consider the range over which the fluence could actually have been observed , i.e. , for fluences above the threshold @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting normalized fluence probability distribution is @xmath51-\\ln f \\right)^2 }     \\over{2\\sigma^2}}\\right ] \\theta(f - f_t ) d(\\ln f ) }     \\over{{1\\over 2 }     \\left(1+\\hbox{erf}\\left [ { { \\ln\\left [ e_0     c(z)\\right]-\\ln(f_t ) } \\over { \\sqrt{2}\\sigma } } \\right]\\right)}}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the heaviside function ( 1 above @xmath53 , and 0 below ) and @xmath54 converts energies in the burst s frame to fluences in our frame ; the denominator results from integrating over the numerator from @xmath21 to infinity .",
    "for the bayesian formulation we also need the priors for the model parameters .",
    "there is no reason to favor one energy over another over many energy decades , and thus i assume the prior is constant in logarithimic space : @xmath55)^{-1 } de_0=(\\ln[e_u / e_l])^{-1 } d\\ln e_0= ( \\log_{10 } [ e_u / e_l])^{-1 } d\\log_{10 } e_0 $ ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the upper and lower limits of the permitted range ( because of the logarithmic dependence , the result is not very sensitive to the precise values ) .",
    "i will use @xmath58 erg and @xmath59 erg .",
    "similarly , i have no a priori information about @xmath50 , and therefore assign it a uniform prior between 0 and 5 .",
    "note that the distribution function is explicitly a function of @xmath60 and @xmath50 , and the priors indicate that these are indeed the natural parameters .",
    "i assume that the underlying energy probability distribution is @xmath61 if @xmath62 is extended to 0 or @xmath63 to infinity , then we must restrict @xmath64 to be less than or greater than 1 , respectively .",
    "the expected fluence probability distribution , accounting for the fluence threshold @xmath21 , is @xmath65^{\\alpha-1 } } \\theta(f - f_t )     \\over{1-(\\max [ e_1,f_t / c(z)]/e_2)^{1-\\alpha } } } f^{-\\alpha } df     & ; \\quad e_1\\le f / c(z ) \\le",
    "e_2,\\quad \\alpha \\ne 1 \\nonumber \\\\ = & { { f^{-1}\\theta(f - f_t)}\\over{\\ln(e_2/\\max [ e_1,f_t / c(z ) ] ) } } df &     ; \\quad e_1\\le f / c(z ) \\le e_2 , \\quad \\alpha = 1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again @xmath54 converts burst energies to fluences .    as with @xmath66 for the lognormal distribution , i have no reason to prefer any value of the energy limits @xmath62 and @xmath63 over many energy decades , and therefore i again use logarithmic priors for these two energies . for definiteness , i will assume that @xmath62 can have a value between @xmath67 and @xmath68 erg , and @xmath63 between @xmath68 and @xmath69 erg .",
    "the spectral index is assumed to have a uniform prior between @xmath70 and 2.5 .",
    "the methodology discussed above requires the energy fluence @xmath11 , the threshold fluence @xmath21 and the redshift @xmath19 for each burst .",
    "i consider 3 samples .",
    "the b9 sample consists of 9 bursts with batse data and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the fluences were calculated by fitting the batse spectrum accumulated over the entire burst with the `` grb '' function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) , and then integrating the resulting fit over the 202000  kev energy range in the burst s rest frame and over the time during which the spectrum was accumulated .",
    "the resulting fits are presented in jimenez et al .",
    "there are some bursts for which the high energy power law in the grb function has an index @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ) and thus the fluence depends crucially on the high energy cutoff ( or roll - off ) which must exist for a finite fluence but which could not be determined from the batse data .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts are taken from frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the limiting fluence @xmath21 is more difficult to determine .",
    "the bursts in our sample must have been intense enough to be first detected and then properly localized .",
    "in addition , a decision was made to attempt to observe the afterglow and thus determine the redshift .",
    "these threshold quantities have generally not been reported .",
    "note also that detectors almost never trigger on the fluence but usually trigger on the peak count rate sampled over a time bin of a specified duration . here",
    "i will assume that the ratio of the observed to threshold fluence , @xmath73 , is the same as the ratio of the observed to threshold peak count rate , @xmath74 , for the batse data .",
    "these thresholds are most likely underestimates of the true thresholds .",
    "the @xmath74 ratio is a standard part of the batse catalog ( batse team 2001 ) ; however , in some cases the batse team did not calculate this quantity because of data gaps , in which case i estimated this ratio from the lightcurves .",
    "this sample is described by table  1 .",
    "the c17 sample consists of the 17 bursts with spectroscopic redshifts and fluences in frail et al .",
    "this sample is basically a superset of the b9 sample with an additional batse burst for which there are no spectra , and bursts observed by _ beppo - sax _ and _",
    "ulysses_. for those bursts without reported detection thresholds i use a fluence threshold of @xmath75  erg  @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the f220 sample uses the 220 bursts in fenimore & ramirez - ruiz ( 2001 ) with redshifts determined by the variability - luminosity correlation .",
    "this sample was selected to have a peak count rate accumulated on the 256 millisecond timescale of greater than 1.5  cts  s@xmath15 , which provides a well - defined detection threshold .",
    "the fluences were taken from the batse catalog without any k - corrections .",
    "note that bloom et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that the k - correction for the 202000  kev energy range is of order unity .",
    "it should be noted that for the first two samples the redshifts are reliable but the detection threshold is very uncertain .",
    "even when the detection threshold is known for the gamma - ray portion of the burst , the effective threshold for optical follow - up observations has not been reported . on the other hand ,",
    "the detection threshold for the third sample is known , but the validity of the variability - luminosity correlation is still not well established , and the uncertainty in the resulting redshifts is not considered .      to determine the sensitivity of the methodology to the number of bursts and to demonstrate the importance of considering the fluence threshold , i ran a series of simulations . for each simulation",
    "i first created between 100 and 500 simulated databases to which i then applied the methodology described above to determine the parameters of their energy distribution .",
    "for some simulations i found the parameters with the fluence thresholds used in creating the database or with much smaller thresholds .    for each simulated burst",
    "i needed a redshift , a burst energy and a fluence threshold .",
    "the redshifts were drawn from a distribution which is similar to the proposed cosmic star formation rate .",
    "the fluence threshold was drawn from a uniform logarithmic distribution over one decade .",
    "the burst energy was drawn from a lognormal distribution with specified central energy and logarithmic width , as long as the resulting fluence was greater than the fluence threshold .",
    "figure 1 shows the importance of considering the fluence threshold in calculating the likelihood .",
    "as can be seen , the best fitted parameter values cluster around the input central energy @xmath77  erg and logarithmic width @xmath78 when the fluence threshold is considered ( asterisks ) , but cluster around a higher energy and narrower width when the fluence threshold is neglected ( diamonds ) .",
    "the fluence threshold removes low energy bursts , resulting in a narrower apparent distribution which is shifted to higher energy .",
    "each of the 100 simulated datasets had 80 bursts , and a fluence threshold between @xmath75 and @xmath79 erg @xmath76 .",
    "figure  2 shows that the likelihood contours for a sample analyzed with the correct fluence thresholds ( left panel ) and thresholds a factor of 10 smaller ( right panel ) differ significantly .",
    "table  2 gives the width of the distributions of the parameters of the lognormal distribution , @xmath80 and @xmath50 , for databases with 9 , 20 , 40 and 80 bursts .",
    "as expected , the distributions become narrower as the number of bursts increases .",
    "as can be seen , a database with 40 bursts should give satisfactory best - fit parameter values .",
    "as can be seen from table  3 , the parameter values at the likelihood maximum for the two distribution functions differ for the three burst samples , and the 90% confidence ranges from one burst sample do not always include the parameters from the other samples .",
    "note that the lower energy cutoff @xmath62 for the simple power law distribution is not fitted .",
    "the fits are insensitive to @xmath62 values smaller than the lowest energy for which any burst in the sample would have been detected , and @xmath62 can not be greater than the smallest observed burst energy ; the difference between these two limits is very small .",
    "figures  38 show the likelihood contours for the fitted parameters . a ridge of somewhat lower likelihood values curves towards lower values of @xmath66 and higher values of @xmath50 for the lognormal distributions .",
    "thus the data do not strongly exclude a broader distribution which includes lower energy bursts which are not detected because their fluence is below the threshold .",
    "consequently , the 90% confidence bounds for the parameters are quite broad . for the power law distributions ,",
    "the favored high energy cutoff is at the highest observed energy in the burst sample ; if the bursts truely have a power law distribution , this cutoff is most likely somewhat greater .",
    "table  3 also provides the average of the cumulative probabilities for each sample and distribution .",
    "as can be seen , these averages are within @xmath81 of the expected value of 1/2 , indicating that the distributions are acceptable descriptions of the data , and that this statistic can not be used to discriminate between distributions .",
    "the actual distributions of these cumulative probabilities are also presented by figures  38 .",
    "finally , table  3 presents the likelihood ratios and the bayesian odds ratios comparing the lognormal to power law distributions .",
    "the likelihood ratio is a bayesian odds ratio using delta function priors set to the parameters which maximize the likelihoods ( which violates the definition of a prior ) .",
    "the bayesian odds ratios given here use the priors described in  2.3 .",
    "the ratios show that using a broad prior distribution favors the lognormal distribution over the power law distribution .",
    "based on the odds ratio , the b9 and c17 samples are insufficient to discriminate between the two distribution functions . on the other hand , the odds ratio favors the lognormal distribution for the f220 sample .",
    "the parameters and parameter ranges differ for the three different burst samples .",
    "it is not clear whether we yet have a sufficiently large , properly defined burst sample from which to calculate the energy distribution .",
    "the two samples with spectroscopic redshifts do not have correct detection thresholds : the threshold for detecting the burst itself is usually reported , but the intensity threshold which triggers further localization and spectroscopic redshift determination has not been reported .",
    "indeed , there may not yet be a formal definition of such a followup threshold . thus these two samples are flawed . on the other hand ,",
    "the validity of the variability - determined redshifts has not yet been proven , although the detection threshold was defined in choosing the burst sample .",
    "the importance of the detection thresholds for statistical studies of burst samples argues for well - defined ( and reported ) intensity thresholds for triggering the followup observations of the expected large number of _ hete - ii _ and _ swift _ burst localizations .",
    "the distributions of cumulative probabilities and the averages of these distributions indicate that the two functional forms used here are sufficient to describe the distribution of energies ; consequently , i concluded that the data do not justify trying more complicated distribution functions at this time .",
    "the bayesian odds ratio does not distinguish between these two functional forms for the two samples with spectroscopic redshifts , although it does favor the lognormal distribution for the large f220 sample with redshifts derived from the variability of the burst lightcurves .",
    "the energy distribution can not be determined for energies below the lowest energy threshold ( i.e. , the lowest burst energy corresponding to the fluence thresholds ) . indeed , hakkila et al .",
    "( 1996 ) make a distinction between the `` observed '' and `` intrinsic '' luminosity functions in their study of luminosity functions for cosmological bursts based on the shape of the peak flux distribution ; they point out that the observed distribution may be much narrower than the intrinsic distribution . in my study",
    "the true low energy cutoff of the power law distribution can not be determined .",
    "similarly , the likelihood contours for the lognormal distribution do not rule out broader distributions with lower central energies .",
    "we anticipate that the _ hete - ii _ and _ swift _ missions will result in the construction of a large burst sample with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "properly defined subsets can be studied to identify trends with burst redshift , duration , and other properties .",
    "as we move from the study of individual bursts to the study of burst ensembles , we must define and report the criteria ( e.g. , detection thresholds ) by which the burst samples are collected .",
