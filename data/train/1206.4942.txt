    "a massive object embedded in a planetary ring creates a propeller - shaped disturbance in the local disk continuum @xcite .",
    "swarms of such `` propellers , '' each with central moonlet radii  @xmath0  m , occur in the 3,000-km - wide `` propeller belts '' region in the middle part of saturn s a  ring @xcite , though photometric ambiguities make it difficult to precisely ascertain the central moonlets masses @xcite .",
    "a second propeller - rich region has been identified in the outermost regions of the a  ring ( * ? ? ? * hereafter t10 ) .",
    "propellers in this region are both larger and rarer than in the propeller belts , and several have been tracked for periods of several years .",
    "the propeller nicknamed `` blriot''[multiblock footnote omitted ] is the largest ( @xmath1  km ) and best - tracked ( @xmath2 detections over 5  years ) .",
    "its orbit is predominantly keplerian , with longitude residuals less than @xmath3 ( 200  km ) over a period of nearly 5  yr .",
    "however , the residuals are much larger than measurement error and are clearly systematic ( t10 ; data reproduced in fig .  [ bleriot_orbit ] ) .",
    "if the observed non - keplerian motion is interpreted in terms of changes in the instantaneous semimajor axis @xmath4 , then blriot migrated outward from mid-2006 to mid-2007 at a rate of @xmath5  km / yr , and inward from late-2007 to early-2009 at a rate of @xmath6  km / yr ( t10 ) .        a linear trend in semimajor axis , that is to say constant @xmath7 , corresponds to a quadratic trend in the longitude residual , @xmath8 .",
    "the observed longitude residuals for blriot can be interpreted in terms of a series of piecewise quadratics ( red lines in fig .",
    "[ bleriot_orbit ] ) that would imply episodic migration , perhaps caused and punctuated by periodic encounters or collisions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while plausible , this mechanism needs further development , and this paper will not discuss it further .",
    "other mechanisms for blriot s non - keplerian motion have been proposed , and are reviewed below :    the observed longitude residuals for blriot can be interpreted in terms of a sinusoidal oscillation with period 3.7  yr ( blue line in fig .",
    "[ bleriot_orbit ] ) .",
    "although the most obvious physical mechanism to produce a sinusoidal longitude residual is resonant interaction with a larger moon exterior to the rings , a mechanism which governs many phenomena in the rings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no resonance is known near blriot s position that could plausibly cause longitude residuals with the observed large amplitudes . in the `` frog '' mechanism suggested by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter pc10 ) and further developed by @xcite , the propeller moonlet interacts primarily with the mass at either end of the propeller gap . modeling those ends as co - orbiting masses",
    ", pc10 found that the propeller moonlet plausibly librates with the observed amplitude and period .",
    "however , one wonders whether the moon - formed gap responds sluggishly enough to allow the moon to librate within it .",
    "two predictions of this may soon be tested : that blriot s 3,000-km - long gap structure ( which is only seen clearly in a few images ) is stationary with respect to the librations , and that the longitude residual will continue to follow a sinusoidal profile into the future .",
    "other hypotheses for blriot s non - keplerian motion , including the one we present below , rely on the concept of `` type  i migration . ''",
    "as classically formulated for protoplanetary disks @xcite , the angular momentum exchange at inner lindblad resonances between a disk and an embedded mass fails to exactly cancel with that at outer lindblad resonances , resulting in a differential torque that leads to inward migration of the embedded mass .",
    "however , classical type  i migration depends crucially on the gas component of the disk , which causes lindblad resonance locations to shift asymmetrically . for the case of planetary rings , which are strictly particulate , (",
    "* hereafter c10 ) re - derived the equations for type  i migration from first principles , using analytical arguments and numerical simulations to trace the angular momentum exchange between streamlines of continuum ring particles and the embedded moon , and deriving a profile of torque per unit disk surface density as a function of the impact parameter @xmath9 ( i.e. , the difference in semimajor axis ) of ring particle streamlines with respect to the moon ( fig .",
    "[ cridacalc ] ) .",
    "the primary contribution does not depend on resonances , which are more symmetrically placed in a non - gaseous particulate disk , but on intrinsic asymmetries in the single - impulse transfer of angular momentum .",
    "c10 find an intrinsic asymmetric torque , akin to classic type  i migration , in the case of a particulate disk with uniform surface density ; it is always inward ( while blriot is seen to move both inward and outward ) and is one to two orders of magnitude too weak to explain the magnitude of blriot s observed non - keplerian motion ( c10 ) .",
    "however , it is known that saturn s rings do not have uniform surface density .",
    "* hereafter rp10 ) considered stochastic temporal variations of the surface density due to self - gravity wakes in the region of maximum angular momentum transfer , finding that they induce a random walk in the propeller moon s semimajor axis . under certain realistic conditions , the magnitude of the longitude residual approaches that observed for blriot , and",
    "since a random walk has no preferred frequency , any frequency might be apparent over a limited period of time .",
    "the model of rp10 predicts that the quasi - sinusoidal behavior observed by t10 will not continue , but will instead be seen as part of an overall random progression .",
    "in saturn s rings , the surface density changes not only with time ( as in the model of rp10 ) , but also with position ( ring radius , or the distance from saturn s center within the ring plane ) . thus , we propose here that type  i torques can act to keep the embedded moon s semimajor axis at an equilibrium position , given a certain radial profile of the surface density . indeed ,",
    "radial surface density structure in the ring means that any propeller must constantly migrate due to imbalanced torques , unless it finds a location where the torques balance .",
    "thus , we should expect to find them at such equilibrium points .",
    "the `` sweet spots''[multiblock footnote omitted ] where angular momentum exchange @xmath10 is maximized in the c10 calculations of type  i torque are at @xmath11  hill radii[multiblock footnote omitted ] on either side of the embedded moon s semimajor axis ( fig .",
    "[ cridacalc ] ) . these local maxima occur because @xmath12 increases with impact parameter @xmath9 in the horseshoe region ( @xmath13 ) , while it decreases with @xmath9 in the farther region ( @xmath14 ) where particles are only moderately deflected by the encounter ( see , e.g. , fig .  3.30 of * ?",
    ". between those two regions lies a chaotic zone where @xmath12 is depressed by the fact that particles can be deflected to either side of the moon , thus leading to two peaks at @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( c10 ) .",
    "the sign of the torque is positive ( negative ) on the inward ( outward ) side of the moon in the moderate deflection region , and vice - versa for the horseshoe and chaotic regions ( fig .",
    "[ cridacalc ] ) .",
    "although c10 s results are plotted for only a single value of the embedded moon mass , scaling relations can be determined .",
    "such scaling is needed because the moon mass used in their models is 400  times larger than blriot s likely mass ( t10 )  in fact , it is 20  times larger than the moon daphnis mass @xcite and thus represents a moon that would not create a propeller structure but rather a fully cleared gap .",
    "c10 state that their total cumulative torque scales as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the embedded moon . however,[multiblock footnote omitted ] one factor of @xmath19 does not enter into our calculations since it comes from integrating the difference between the torques on the inner and outer sides of the moon under c10 s assumption of constant surface density , as their @xmath20 ( eq .  34 of c10 ) , using the scaled impact parameter @xmath21 . for our purposes , we note that @xmath22 itself is proportional[multiblock footnote omitted ] to @xmath23 , where the moon s specific angular momentum is @xmath24 for semimajor axis @xmath25 and mean motion @xmath26 ( for this reason , in fig .",

    "the radial density structure @xmath35 is external to , and unaffected by , the embedded moon ; in fact , such radial density structure is common in saturn s rings ( see section  [ numerical ] for more discussion ) .",

    "[ bleriot_orbit ] ) resemble a series of curves somewhat better than they resemble a smooth sinusoid .",
    "the residuals for this new functional fit are significantly better than for the sinusoidal fit ( though with 10 degrees of freedom , compared with 5 for the sinusoidal fit ) , and are comparable to those for the piecewise quadratic fit ( t10 ) , with particular improvement for the spring 2007 data ( fig .

    "the model presented in this paper is motivated by the observed orbital evolution of blriot and other propellers , which seems to be characterized by periodic `` kicks , '' with slow variations in the semimajor axis ( seen as curvature in the longitude residuals ) occurring between those kicks .",
    "it is in response to these observations that we have constructed a mechanism that is dynamically plausible and consistent with existing data .",
    "our proposed mechanism joins two others recently outlined , and all three mechanisms make contrasting predictions regarding the future behavior of blriot s azimuthal residual . while pc10 predict that the quasi - sinusoidal trend discerned in the azimuthal residual to date will continue , and rp10 predict that variations in the azimuthal residual will be seen in the future to result from stochastic variation in the semimajor axis , we predict periodic ( less than one per year , on average , from our interpretation of existing data ) sudden `` kicks '' to the semimajor axis followed by asymptotic return to the equilibrium value .",
