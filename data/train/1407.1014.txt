    "the topological constraints may eventually lead to a localization of self - diffusion within a small finite volume .",
    "dynamic light scattering ( dls ) has served as a useful tool to probe the molecular diffusion of this kind of system since the relaxation of the density fluctuations is reflected in the dynamic scattered electric field correlation function @xmath2 .",

    "all regimes present power law dependence of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 with the scattering vector @xmath1 .",
    "one of the interpretations of these results is based upon mechanisms of anomalous diffusion , where the mean - square displacement @xmath7 of scattering units is empirically given as either a power law or a logarithmic regime @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two functions is @xmath8 $ ] where @xmath1 is the scattering vector . in all analysis",
    "the temporal correlation function of polymer systems is treated in separate parts and a model that explains the dynamic behavior over the full time range has not yet been presented .",
    "similar results were observed in colloidal gels @xcite .",
    "beyond the gel point the correlation function tends , for large times , to a non - zero plateau indicating a freezing of the density fluctuations .",
    "the analysis of experimental correlation curves in this case is given in terms of empirical expressions @xcite ; vibrational modes of the network @xcite ; and also by the model of anomalous diffusion of segments @xcite .",
    "krall and weitz @xcite also observed a plateau in the correlation function for polystyrene colloidal gels .",
    "they analyzed the correlation function in terms of overdamped normal modes of fractal clusters where the mean square displacement is given by the sum of exponential relaxations reflecting the relaxation of separate localized elastic modes of the gel .",
    "this sum leads to a stretched exponential type dependence :    @xmath9 . \\label{primeiraequacao}\\ ] ]    this expression describes the entire temporal domain seen by dynamic light scattering .",

    "the type of surfactant employed in the ferrotec ferrofluid was not disclosed by the supplier .",
    "all samples were prepared in sealed 20 ml cylindrical glass vials ( wheaton ) and were kept at @xmath19c for nearly 12 hours to ensure that all monomers had reacted .",

    "the samples were maintained in a thermal bath at 25.0@xmath21c with a precision of @xmath22 0.1@xmath21c .    to minimize non - ergodic sampling effects inherent in polymer gels",
    ", we adopted the strategy of sampling a large gel volume and used a relatively large detection area in the photomultiplier ( pin - hole diameter 400 @xmath14 m , corresponding to nearly 15 coherence areas ) .",

    "the self - diffusivity of molecular chains is progressively slowed , since to perform any movement they have to drag surrounding polymer segments .",
    "this effect is more pronounced as the number of connections or complexity of the structure increases .",
    "for highly connected networks the diffusivity may reach a state of bounded diffusion , in which each segment diffuses only in a limited region of space . in previous works",
    "we have shown that the diffusion regime is determined by the topological connectivity in the network given by its spectral dimension @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite . accordingly",
    ", a critical value @xmath32 divides the non - bounded from the bounded self - diffusion regime .",
    "the consequence of a bounded regime in dls experiments is that the localization of gel segment excursions leads to a mean frozen structure .",
    "this also corresponds to the non - ergodic nature of gels leading to persistent speckle patterns in the scattered intensity . above the gel point ,",
    "as the structure progressively freezes , it becomes less correlated , the fluctuations being localized within independent volumes given by mesh sizes typically less than 1 micron .",
    "dynamics of density or structure fluctuations around the mean can be understood as the source of a dynamic signal superimposed on the mean speckles .",
    "the scattering becomes intrinsically heterodyne .    to obtain the information about the dynamics of the polymer gels one considers both the fluctuating and static parts in the normalized first order correlation function",
    "this is achieved by defining the gel correlation function as    @xmath33    while @xmath2 contains only the fluctuating part of the scattered field as in eq.[heter ] .",
    "@xmath34 measures the intensity fluctuation strength and is defined as @xmath35 .",
    "the definition above implicitly decouples the static field from the fluctuating field at the detector .",
    "hence the static field is defined as the average of the scattered electric field complex amplitude , which corresponds to the mean position of the confined scatterers .",
    "replacing @xmath2 of eq.[g1gel ] in eq.[heter ] one obtains the relation between the intensity ( measured ) and electric field correlation function :    @xmath36    the electric field correlation functions @xmath37 are calculated from eq.[siergemod ] , in which the parameter @xmath6 was found for each scattering angle in the limit @xmath38 $ ] measured in a dilute solution of the same standard latex used in the gel , whose value changes slightly with the detector angle and lies around 0.5 .",
    "the small value of @xmath6 is due to the large detection area .",
    "the fluctuation strength @xmath34 was obtained for each scattering angle by extrapolation to @xmath39 in eq.[siergemod ] , noting that @xmath40 .",
    "so @xmath41^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "a set of typical correlation functions @xmath37 are shown in fig.[correl ] . in all samples",
    "the correlation curves show an exponential decay at short times ( @xmath42 ) and an asymptotic behavior at very long times . as discussed by krall and weitz @xcite this behavior",
    "can be explained as the result of the restricted movement of scattering particles . since the particles are allowed to visit only a limited volume , their positions as well as the scattered intensity in different times are always correlated .",
    "the asymptotic correlation value depends on the ratio of the length through which the particles can diffuse to the scattering length @xmath43 .",
    "the scatterers must change their relative position by about @xmath43 to make an appreciable variation in the scattered intensity .",
    "so in the condition of large @xmath43 ( small angles ) the restricted particle movements have little effect in changing the value of the scattered intensity and and small fluctuations result . in the opposite small @xmath43 limit ,",
    "the intensity fluctuations become quasi homodyne and the correlation function decays fully . since the system is non - ergodic , we calculated the average from approximatively 20 different positions of one of the samples to obtain realistic ensemble averages",
    ". however we verify that observation of different positions of the same sample changes only the asymptotic plateau , but not the shape of the correlation curves . in all the other samples",
    "the data was collected in just one position .",
    "since the light scattered by the particles - containing gels is at least 20 times greater than that from neat gels , it can be assumed that the signal is due essentially to the trapped particles . in dilute conditions",
    "the correlation function is related to the mean square displacement of each scattering particle @xmath44 by @xmath45 and we can calculate the self - diffusion coefficient from the correlation function by    @xmath46    in fig.[dif ] it is shown that the diffusion coefficient @xmath47 has two distinct regimes : free diffusivity for short times where @xmath47 is nearly constant ; and an anomalous regime characterized by a temporal power law over almost three decades .    to describe the full - time behavior of @xmath47 we use a mass - spring rouse - like or gaussian network model @xcite . in previous works we generalized the rouse model to describe the dynamics either of regular networks with arbitrary dimensionality @xcite or that of fractal networks @xcite . for regular networks",

    "the expression for the mean square displacement predicts three distinct regimes : for short times ( @xmath52 ) the last term tends to a linear dependence on time , which corresponds to the free diffusion regime of the isolated units with @xmath53 ; for long times the first term is dominant and the mean square displacement is given by the diffusion of the entire structure with mass proportional to @xmath49 or @xmath54 .",
    "this regime is not achieved experimentally for ordinary gels , but it could be verified for isolated clusters or microgels .    from eq.[r2 ] it is straightforward to show that the diffusion coefficient in eq.[ddef ] is then given by    @xmath55 \\label{difftotal}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the sum of the relaxations of the @xmath15 vibration modes    @xmath57    evaluating the terms in eq.[r2 ] and eq.[difftotal ] we verified that the last sum is dominant for infinitely large networks ( @xmath58 ) , and hence    @xmath59 ^{d } \\label{drouse}.\\ ] ]    as for the mean square displacement , at short times ( @xmath52 ) the diffusion coefficient approaches the free diffusion coefficient @xmath51 .",

    "the same equations are valid for fractal networks , replacing @xmath48 in eq.[drouse ] , eq.[danomalous ] and eq.[r2anomalous ] with the spectral dimension @xmath31 , which describes the network topology .",
    "the data presentation using @xmath47 instead of @xmath65 is preferable since the anomalous regime is easily recognized as a straight line in a log - log plot . in fig.[dif ] we can see the least squares fit to the experimental data using eq.[drouse ] ( continuous lines ) , with @xmath66 , which is a very good approximation to the limit @xmath58 .",
    "the model gives a fair description of the diffusion dynamics over the whole time range of the measurements .",
    "in the same plot is shown the expected value for the free diffusion coefficient for the latex beads in pure solvent ( dashed line ) .",
    "we observe that the diffusion coefficient of the gels in the thermodynamic limit @xmath67 using latex beads corresponds approximately to the expected value for the free diffusion coefficient . in the ferrogels the measured",
    "limiting diffusion coefficient is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the free diffusion value .",
    "it was observed that some ferrofluids form aggregates when dispersed in a gel matrix @xcite thereby decreasing the apparent diffusion coefficient .",
    "however the size of the aggregates is not large enough to explain the measured limiting values ( @xmath68 @xmath69/s for the emg308 ; @xmath70 @xmath69/s for the emg408 and @xmath71 @xmath69/s for the m300 ) .",
    "it is still plausible to account for network distortions around the magnetic particle aggregates that increase their effective viscous drag and decrease their effective initial diffusivity .",

    "although the form of the diffusion coefficient remains the same for all scattering angles , the fitted parameters display a @xmath1 dependence .",
