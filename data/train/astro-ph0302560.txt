    "we adopt the following notation .",
    "the hubble constant is @xmath19 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and @xmath20 is the speed of light .",
    "the density of baryons , matter , radiation , photons , neutrinos , and dark energy , at present , in critical units , are indicated as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 respectively ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the physical quantities , independent of @xmath28 , are indicated with @xmath29 ; e.g. , @xmath30 . when needed , a standard , flat , reference @xmath9cdm model with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath10",
    "is assumed @xcite .",
    "in this section we use the ages of the oldest globular clusters in combination with the location of the first acoustic peak of the cmb power spectrum @xcite to constrain the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the method is briefly described in section 2.1 and the results are given in section 2.2 .",
    "if the universe is assumed to be flat , the position of the first acoustic peak ( @xmath34 in the standard spherical harmonics notation ) depends primarily on the age of the universe and on the effective value to indicate when @xmath0 is allowed to vary over time . ] of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as noted by these authors , for a fixed @xmath0 value , a change in the physical density parameter @xmath30 that keeps the characteristic angular scale of the first acoustic peak fixed will also leave the age approximately unchanged .",

    "it is clear from the plot that an independent and accurate age determination of the universe will provide a measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "thus by using only the _ wmap _ observation of @xmath34 and an independent estimate of the age of the universe , we can place constraints on @xmath0 , largely independent of other cosmological parameters .",
    "the ages of the oldest globular clusters ( gcs ) provide a lower limit to the total age of the universe .",
    "numerous star - forming galaxies have now been observed up to redshift @xmath47 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the oldest gcs contain the oldest stellar populations in galaxies , it is reasonable to assume that gcs too have formed at redshift @xmath48 .",

    "* ) , gcs likely formed prior to the reionization epoch . under this assumption ,",
    "the _ wmap _ recent estimate of the reionization redshift @xmath49 @xcite implies that the ages of the oldest globular cluster do not significantly underestimate the age of the universe .",
    "globular cluster ages can reliably be estimated in several different ways : from the luminosity of the main - sequence turn - off ( if the distance is known ) , from detached binaries , from the termination of the white - dwarf sequence , and from the luminosity function method which provides a joint constraint on the age and distance of a gc . @xcite",
    "determine the distance to ngc  6752 by means of accurate photometry of gc white dwarfs and obtained an age of @xmath50 gyr .",

    "we conservatively add 0.3 gyr .    in order to constrain @xmath0",
    ", we assume a flat universe and monte carlo simulate the distribution of @xmath34 subject to only weak constraints on the other cosmological parameters . for different values of @xmath0 , we generate @xmath66 models , randomly sampling the cosmological parameters @xmath22 , @xmath67 and @xmath28 with uniform priors , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "we then impose an age of the universe constraint by randomly sampling these models so that the age of the universe has a probability distribution whose shape is given by equation [ eq : kraussagecorr ] , but offset by @xmath71 gyr .",
    "we use the publicly available code cmbfast @xcite to compute the resulting distribution of @xmath34 .",
    "this is shown in figure  2 where the two solid lines are the 68% and 90% _ joint _ confidence levels .",
    "as expected , the age alone does not constrain @xmath0 ; there is a degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath34 . if we now use the _",
    "observed _ position of the first acoustic peak as recently measured , in a model independent way , from _ wmap _",
    "@xcite , we can constrain @xmath0 with high accuracy . the filled contours in figure  2",
    "are marginalized values for @xmath0 at the 68% and 90% confidence levels .",
    "thus we find @xmath1 ( @xmath72 ) at the 68% ( 90% ) confidence level .",
    "if we drop the assumption that the oldest gc must have formed before reionization , but still impose that they must have formed by @xmath73 , this constraint is slightly weakened . in this case the age distribution of equation [ eq : kraussagecorr ] needs to be offset by @xmath74 gyr and we obtain @xmath75 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "we have also repeated the calculation using gaussian priors for the cosmological parameters , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and find similar , but slightly more stringent constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "we stress here that this determination depends solely on the gc determination of the age of the universe and on the _ observed _ position of the first acoustic peak in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "our constraint is slightly less stringent than that obtained by @xcite from a joint likelihood analysis of _ wmap _ with six external data sets ( _ wmap _ + cbi + acbar + 2dfgrs + lyman@xmath18 forest power spectrum + type  ia supernovae + @xmath11 constraint from the _ hst _ key project ) , but is tighter than the cmb - only ( _ wmap _ + cbi + acbar ) determination and comparable to the _ wmap _ + acbar + cbi + _ hst _ constraint .",
    "we now turn our attention to the age of the oldest objects in the universe at @xmath80 as a function of redshift .",
    "as recently suggested by @xcite , these can be used to determine @xmath81 and therefore to measure @xmath3 and @xmath11 .",
    "the hubble parameter is given by @xmath82 $ ] , where @xmath83 is the total density of the universe .",

    "thus a measurement of @xmath4 is also a measurement of @xmath3 ; for further details , see @xcite .    to obtain @xmath4 , @xcite proposed to use the old envelope of the age ",
    "redshift relation of e / s0 galaxies .",
    "we assume that e / s0 at different redshifts are drawn from the same parent population with the bulk of their stellar populations formed at relatively high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then , at relatively low redshift , they are evolving passively and may be used as `` cosmic chronometers '' .    in the rest of this section",
    "we will apply this method to a sample of spectra ( described in  3.2 ) to identify the age ",
    "redshift relation defined by the old envelope (  3.3 ) and derive an independent measurement of @xmath11 (  3.4 ) .",
    "we show that at the level of accuracy of our measurement , the use of the age  redshift relation allows us to apply this method even if a fraction of the stars in e / s0 galaxies is assembled at @xmath87 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also briefly discuss the prospects of using this method to derive @xmath3 .      in order to apply this method",
    "we need high - quality spectra of a sample of old stellar populations covering the largest possible range in redshift . to this aim",
    "we combine the following data sets : ( i ) the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) early data release @xcite ; ( ii ) the sample of field early - type galaxies from ( * ? ? ?",

    "the lrg sample is the most heterogenous , since it includes red galaxies in general , regardless of morphology .",

    "the spectra in the treu et al",

    "this selection criterion discards dusty or star - forming objects .",
    "the spectra of seven red galaxies in the cluster ms1054@xmath880321 were obtained by one of us ( ds ) on ut 11 march 2002 using the dual - beam low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; * ? ? ?",

    "on the blue side , we used the 300 lines mm@xmath7 grism ( @xmath93  ; spectral resolution @xmath94  ) and on the red side , we used the the 400 lines mm@xmath7 grating ( @xmath95  ; spectral resolution @xmath96  ) .",
    "these observations , which were obtained at the parallactic angle , totaled one hour of integration . in order to ensure no gaps in the spectra ,",
    "half the data were obtained with a d560 dichroic and the remainder were obtained with a d680 dichroic .",
    "these spectra have a @xmath91 of 8 .",

    "examples of the spectra used are given in figure  3 .",
    "the age of the dominant stellar population in the galaxies is obtained by fitting single stellar population models @xcite to the observed spectrum .",
    "these models have been extensively tested @xcite and have two free parameters : age and metallicity . by construction , star formation",
    "is assumed to occur in a single burst of duration much shorter ( @xmath97% ) than the current age of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the derived ages are single - burst equivalent ages .",
    "the best fit model is found by standard @xmath98 minimization .",
    "then , stellar ages and their errors are obtained by marginalizing the resulting likelihood surface over metallicity .",
    "some examples for the parameter confidence regions , at the 1 and 2@xmath99 level , are shown in figure  3 .",
    "note that for galaxies with high @xmath91 , like the treu et al .",
    "sample , the constraints in both age and metallicity are very tight and thus the so - called age - metallicity degeneracy is dramatically reduced and does not affect the age determination at a significant level .    before we can use the estimated ages to constrain @xmath11 we have to estimate the effects of the potential systematic uncertainties related to adopting a single - burst stellar population model and a single - metallicity model . as far as the first uncertainty is concerned ,",
    "we know that even massive field e / s0 galaxies can experience some level of star formation activity at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a young and luminous stellar population superimposed on a dominant old stellar population can bias the single - burst equivalent ages of the spectrum to be much younger than the mass - weighted average age .",
    "although this is a serious concern for the interpretation of individual cases , our method relies on the old envelope of the age distribution at any given redshift .",
    "therefore , the effects of this bias on the determination of @xmath11 and @xmath0 are strongly reduced , as we discuss further in   3.2 .",
    "concerning single metallicity , the uncertainty connected to metallicity gradients is negligible with respect to other sources of uncertainty .",
    "in fact , our spectra typically cover @xmath100 kpc ( for the lrg ) to @xmath101 kpc ( for the higher redshift samples ) . given that typical metallicity gradients in e / s0s follow @xmath102/ d { \\rm log } r = -0.2 $ ] @xcite , metallicity only changes by 0.2 dex within this region .",
    "this is fairly small and the single - metallicity approximation affects our results well within the 1@xmath99 value of the error in the recovered metallicity .",
    "figure  4 shows the derived single - burst equivalent ages of the galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "the circles correspond to galaxies in the sdss lrg sample , triangles to the treu et al .",
    "sample , diamonds are galaxies in ms1054@xmath880321 , and crosses are 53w091 and 53w069 . for clarity ,",
    "the sdss lrg points have not been plotted for ages @xmath103 gyr .",
    "typical errors on the ages of lrg galaxies are 10% and are not plotted .",
    "redshift relation ( i.e. , an `` edge '' or `` envelope '' of the galaxy distribution in the age ",
    "redshift plane ) is apparent from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "although an envelope can be identified , it is important to notice that there is a large spread of ages at any given redshift .",
    "in particular , the measured age for many galaxies makes them significantly younger than the age  redshift envelope .",
    "this is in part due to a real spread in the star formation histories of early - type galaxies , especially in the field , but mostly a result of using single - burst equivalent ages .",
    "single - burst equivalent ages effectively measure a luminosity - weighted age .",
    "therefore , even a relatively minor episode of star formation is sufficient to significantly underestimate the age of the bulk of ( old ) stars .",
    "indeed , many of the galaxies in the treu et al .",
    "sample show [ ]  @xmath1043727 emission , consistent with minor ongoing star formation activity @xcite .",
    "is this contamination enough to bias our results , or is the use of the relative ages of the old - envelope sufficient to reduce this bias to useful levels ?    to answer this question we consider a scenario where the bulk of stars in e / s0 galaxies formed at high redshift , while a relatively small fraction ( up to 10% in mass ) of stars is formed at later times ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "this scenario is approximately consistent with the observed evolution of the number density @xcite , colors @xcite , and spectral properties of early - type galaxies @xcite . within this scenario ,",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to estimate the effects of this bias on the age  redshift relation and ultimately on @xmath11 and @xmath3 determinations .",
    "we generate galaxy spectra assuming that after the initial burst of star formation at @xmath106 an extra 10% of the stellar mass is formed at a time @xmath107 between redshift @xmath108 with uniform probability for @xmath107 . for simplicity , we use discrete values for the ages with spacing 0.1 gyr and assume a flat @xmath31 , @xmath10 and @xmath32 cosmology to convert time to redshift .",
    "the metallicity for a given galaxy is chosen to be uniformly distributed in the range @xmath109 . finally , we add random noise to the spectra so that @xmath110 and determine the age with the same procedure used for the data .",
    "the results of our monte carlo simulations are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the top panel shows the simulated age ",
    "redshift distribution if only six early - types are found per redshift interval .",
    "the edge is blurred and smeared due to recent star formation contamination and because of the error in the age determination ; nevertheless , it is clearly recognizable .",
    "the galaxies observed within a few 100 myr of bursts have very small single - burst equivalent ages , as observed for some galaxies in the lrg and treu et al .",
    "sample , but they do not interfere with the location of the old envelope .",
    "the lower panel shows the distribution for the case where 60 early - types are observed per redshift bin ( this is less than the number of galaxies in the sdss lrg sample ) .",
    "the solid line shows the theoretical position of the edge , which is remarkably close to observed edge .",
    "note also that increasing the number of galaxies has improved the agreement between the observed and theoretical edge .",
    "thus we conclude that small , recent bursts of star formation do not introduce a significant bias on the edge position ; our primary uncertainty in determining @xmath3 to high redshift is the sparse size of the sample of distant , early - types considered here . we can now attempt to recover @xmath4 from this simulation by looking at the shift in the edge position as a function of @xmath111 ( see   3.4 and",
    "* ) and thus deduce @xmath3 .",
    "we recover @xmath112 for the whole redshift range .",
    "this shows that , with a sample similar to the lrg sample extended to higher redshift , we should be able to measure @xmath3 within a few 10% .",
    "this is similar to what was already concluded in @xcite .",
    "having established that the age ",
    "redshift relation for the old envelope is not significantly affected by the bias caused by later episodes of star formation , we now consider the observational limits that we can impose on @xmath3 . as a consistency check",
    "we note that the age at @xmath16 obtained here is in good agreement with gc ages ( see  2 ) and that the treu et al.galaxy ages agree with those from of sdss lrg sample where they overlap .",
    "the solid line in figure  4 corresponds to the age ",
    "redshift relation for our flat , reference @xmath9cdm model : @xmath31 , @xmath113 , and @xmath10 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed age ",
    "redshift envelope , and it seems to indicate that we live in a universe with a classical vacuum energy density and that , on average , stars in the oldest galaxies formed about 0.7 gyr after the big bang ( e.g. , at redshifts @xmath114 ) . to make the observed age ",
    "redshift relation consistent with a model with widely different @xmath3 behavior , we would have to infer that early - type galaxies at different redshifts have very different formation epochs for their stellar populations .",
    "for example , the dotted line in figure  4 indicates the age - redshift relation for an evolving population in a universe where @xmath115 for @xmath116 and grows linearly from @xmath117 at @xmath118 to @xmath119 at @xmath16 . for this model to work",
    ", we would have to conclude that the oldest galaxies at @xmath120 formed about 0.7 gyr after the big bang , but that the oldest galaxies at @xmath121 formed @xmath122 gyr after the big bang .",
    "since the oldest galaxies in the lrg sample are as old as the oldest gcs , we consider this to be an unlikely explanation .",
    "furthermore , not only would this scenario require that _ _ a__ll local galaxies either formed their stars more recently than galaxies at high redshift or had a recent episodes of recent star formation , but would also require a remarkable fine - tuning for them all to obtain exactly the same age .",
    "we therefore conclude that this extreme model for @xmath3 is unlikely given the data .",
    "unfortunately , the small number of galaxies in our samples at @xmath8 does not allow us to compute @xmath4 with enough accuracy to constrain @xmath3 , and therefore this measurement will have to await better data .",
    "however , the @xmath123 region is well populated by lrg galaxies ( figure  4 ) and we can determine @xmath124 at @xmath125 .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  4 by the clear shift in the upper envelope of the age histogram between the two redshift ranges @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in the next section",
