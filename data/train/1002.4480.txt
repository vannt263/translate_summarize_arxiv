    "cosmic objects emit in diverse electromagnetic wavelengths from radio to @xmath0-rays . some of them ( e.g. , stars ) are luminous primarily in a narrow wavelength range , while others ( e.g. , active galactic nuclei ) emit in a broad energy spectrum .",
    "it is , therefore , essential to observe a celestial source in various wavelengths in order to fully understand its nature . up to the middle of the twentieth century ,",
    "visible light was the primary window for observation .",
    "but in the last few decades , wavelength - based branches of astronomy have not only been developed , but also got matured . moreover",
    ", many new types of sources have been discovered by the observations in wavelengths other than visible lights .",
    "one such discovery was made in x - rays using rocket - borne instruments in 1962 @xcite .",
    "these instruments detected x - rays from sources outside the solar system for the first time , and specifically discovered a new type of source scorpius x-1 .",
    "this discovery brought a new era in astronomy , and formally gave birth to a new branch called  x - ray astronomy \" .",
    "the new source scorpius x-1 was the first observed x - ray binary , and more specifically it was the first detected low - mass x - ray binary system containing a neutron star and a low - mass stellar companion .    unlike the optical ( i.e. , visible light ) and radio detection instruments , the x - ray instruments must be sent above the atmosphere for observations .",
    "this is because x - rays from space can not reach the surface of the earth . in 1960",
    "s , balloons and sub - orbital rockets were extensively used to lift the x - ray instruments . however , as these carriers are short - lived , satellites were thought to be ideal for x - ray observations .",
    "the first astronomy satellite _ uhuru _ was launched by nasa in 1970 .",
    "it identified over 300 discrete x - ray sources .",
    "nasa s _ einstein _ satellite ( launched in 1978 ) was the first fully imaging x - ray telescope put into space .",
    "its few arcsecond angular resolution increased the sensitivity enormously , and made the imaging of extended objects , and the detection of faint sources possible .",
    "the _ rosat _ satellite launched in 1990 by the germany / us / uk collaboration did the first x - ray all - sky survey using a highly sensitive imaging telescope , and detected more than 150000 objects .",
    "the scientific outcome of these key x - ray space missions , as well as the other past x - ray satellites , have revolutionized our knowledge of the x - ray sky .",
    "the current primary x - ray space missions are ( 1 ) nasa s _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) ; ( 2 ) european space agency s _ xmm - newton _ ; ( 3 ) nasa s _ chandra _ ; and ( 4 ) japan s _ suzaku_.",
    "they primarily operate in the @xmath1 kev range ( i.e. , soft x - rays ) , and contain a variety of instruments .",
    "the primary instrument of _ rxte _ is a set of five proportional counters ( called  proportional counter array \" or pca ) with large collecting area and very good time resolution ( @xmath2 microsecond ) .",
    "therefore , pca is an ideal instrument to study the fast timing phenomena , as well as the continuum energy spectrum .",
    "however , it is not an imaging instrument , and due to poor energy resolution , pca is not very suitable to study spectral lines .",
    "this instrument operates in @xmath3 kev band , although the effective collecting area becomes small above @xmath4 kev .",
    "another very useful instrument of _ rxte _ is  all - sky monitor \" or asm .",
    "it consists of three relatively low - sensitivity proportional counters with large field of view , and hence monitors the entire sky to detect transient x - ray sources .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ contains x - ray telescopes , charge - coupled devices and high resolution  reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ) \" .",
    "therefore , this satellite , that operates in @xmath5 kev range , is a good imager , and is ideal for spectral analysis .",
    "observatory contains an x - ray telescope , charge - coupled devices , high resolution camera and transmission gratings .",
    "its angular resolution ( @xmath6 subarcsecond ) is the best among all the past and current x - ray instruments , which makes it a unique imager .",
    "_ chandra _ is also ideal to detect and study narrow spectral lines , and it operates in @xmath7 kev . finally , the _ suzaku _ satellite also has x - ray telescopes and charge - coupled devices .",
    "since it contains an additional  hard x - ray detector \" ( hxd ) , _ suzaku _ can study the broadband energy spectrum .",
    "all these x - ray space missions , especially the current ones , have gathered a wealth of information about the low - mass x - ray binary systems , and hence our understanding of these sources has grown enormously . in this review , we will give a brief overview of the x - ray observational aspects of neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "we note that the reference list will not be exhaustive in this short review .",
    "neutron stars are extremely compact objects with a mass of about one solar mass ( @xmath8 ) , but a radius of @xmath9 km .",
    "the core density of neutron stars are @xmath10 times the nuclear density , and their magnetic field can be anywhere between @xmath11 gauss .",
    "they can spin with a wide range of frequency values : very slow to several hundred hertz .",
    "study of these stars provides a unique opportunity to probe some extreme aspects of the universe , that can not be achieved by other means .",
    "although the neutron stars were discovered in 1967 , their plausible existence was predicted in 1930 s . around this time ,",
    "subrahmanyan chandrasekhar calculated the upper limit of the mass of a collapsed star ( white dwarf ) that is supported by the electron degeneracy pressure against the gravity .",
    "this limit is the celebrated  chandrasekhar mass limit \" , with a value of about @xmath12 .",
    "if the mass of the collapsed star is greater than this limit , then the star is expected to collapse more .",
    "but if the mass is less than a certain value , the neutron degeneracy pressure will eventually balance the gravity to form a stable star , known as neutron star @xcite .",
    "this remained as a theoretical calculation almost for three decades , after which hewish et al .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of a 1.377 sec period radio pulsar at 81.5 mhz , and gold @xcite showed that the pulsars are spinning neutron stars with large surface magnetic fields .",
    "the density of a neutron star increases by @xmath13 orders of magnitude from the surface to the centre . as a result ,",
    "the constituents and their properties change dramatically with the radial distance ( see , for example , shapiro & teukolsky @xcite ) .",
    "the dense core of a neutron star may contain pion condensates , deconfined quarks , or other exotic ( and possibly unknown ) forms of matter , which makes the study of this part of the star extremely interesting . moreover according to a model , some of the neutron stars are actually  strange stars \" made entirely of u , d and s quarks @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of many theoretical studies , the properties of matter in the core of a neutron star is not yet known , because such a dense degenerate matter can not be created in the laboratory . perhaps the only way to understand",
    "the nature of this high density matter is to constrain the theoretically proposed equation of state models of the stellar core .",
    "this can be done by measuring three independent structural parameters ( e.g. , mass , radius , spin frequency ) of the same neutron star , because the stable stellar structure gives a single mass vs. radius curve for a known spin frequency and a given equation of state model @xcite .",
    "measurement of the stellar parameters is , therefore , a primary goal of the neutron star astronomy .",
    "such a measurement , especially of the radius , is an extremely formidable task .",
    "this can be appreciated from the fact that we need to measure the @xmath9 km radius of a neutron star with @xmath14% error , while the typical distance of the star is @xmath15 km .",
    "neutron stars can emit in various wavelengths depending on their properties and the systems they are in .",
    "they are observed as radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray pulsars ( that may create pulsar wind nebulae ) , millisecond pulsars in binary systems , magnetars , and so on , and can be found in supernova remnants , x - ray binaries , etc . in this review we will concentrate on neutron stars in x - ray binaries .",

    ", width=288 ]        a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) is an old binary stellar system ( typical age @xmath17 years ) with a low - mass companion star ( @xmath18 ; main sequence star , evolved star or white dwarf ) and a primary compact star ( neutron star or black hole ) rotating around each other . in such a system , the companion star fills its roche lobe , i.e. , the critical equipotential surface ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and matter from it flows towards the compact star . because of the initial angular momentum , this matter can not move radially towards the primary star , and follows slow spiral paths that form an accretion disk . in this review ,",
    "we consider the systems with neutron stars as the primary stars . in such neutron star lmxbs",
    ", the accreted matter eventually hits the stellar surface , and generates electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the accretion disk also emits such radiation by viscous dissipation , and both these emissions are powered by the gravitational potential energy release .",
    "the inner part of the accretion disk , as well as the neutron star surface , emit x - rays , as their typical temperature is @xmath19 k. fig .",
    "2 gives an artist s impression of such a system . in the next section",
    ", we will give the basic theory of a simple geometrically thin accretion disk in newtonian gravity .",
    "note that a more realistic approach may include complicated fluid dyanamical processes ( e.g. , mukhopadhyay 2006 @xcite ; mukhopadhyay et al .",
    "@xcite ) and general relativistic effects ( e.g. , mukhopadhyay & misra 2003 @xcite ) . moreover , the magnetosphere of the neutron star can affect the accretion process depending on the accretion rate and the magnetic field strength .",
    "ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite and ghosh & lamb @xcite provided important theoretical understanding of this process . due to accretion induced angular momentum transfer , the neutron stars in lmxbs are expected to be spun up .",
    "this is consistent with the observed stellar spin frequencies ( typically @xmath20 hz ) .",
    "the magnetic fields of these neutron stars are relatively low ( @xmath21 gauss ) compared to the expected fields of these stars when they are born , and several groups have worked on this problem of stellar magnetic field evolution @xcite . note that the low magnetic field allows the accretion disk to approach very close to the neutron star .",
    "this , in combination with the fact that x - rays can be detected both from the star and the inner part of the disk for many lmxbs , provides an excellent opportunity to study the extreme physics of and around neutron stars",
    ". however , the modeling of any observation of the neutron star vicinity should consider the special and general relativistic effects including light bending ( e.g. , datta & kapoor @xcite ) .",
    "lmxbs are observed mostly in the disk , bulge and globular clusters of our galaxy .",
    "some of them have also been discovered from the nearby galaxies , and the locations much above our galactic disk plane . according to the catalogue of liu et al .",
    "@xcite , 187 lmxbs ( containing black hole or neutron star ) were known from our galaxy ,  large magellanic cloud \" and  small magellanic cloud \" up to that time .",
    "lmxbs emit primarily in x - ray wavelengths , and the optical to x - ray luminosity ratio is normally less than 0.1 for them . the central x - ray emission from these sources can not be spatially resolved using the current x - ray imaging instruments , because the distances of even our galactic lmxbs are very large ( typically @xmath15 km ) . therefore , in order to understand the neutron star lmxbs , we have to rely on their spectral and timing properties .",
    "in this review , we will describe some of these properties , as well as the information they provide .      in a neutron star lmxb",
    ", the companion mass is transferred to the neutron star typically via a geometrically thin accretion disk .",
    "therefore , in this section we will briefly discuss the basic theory of such a disk . here",
    "we note that the standard model of steady thin accretion disks in newtonian gravity was worked out by shakura & sunyaev @xcite .    in a thin accretion disk using cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath22 )",
    ", we expect that the @xmath23 component @xmath24 should be the main component of velocity , and the @xmath25 component @xmath26 .",
    "the accreted matter should move around the neutron star with a nearly keplerian speed ( i.e. , the angular speed @xmath27 ; @xmath28 mass of the neutron star ) , and a small radial inflow ( speed @xmath29 ) caused by the effect of viscosity should exist .",
    "we consider @xmath30 because of the @xmath23-symmetry of the system .",
    "then the equation of continuity is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the surface density of the accretion disk . using this and the @xmath23-component of the navier - stokes equation",
    ", we get @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the term involving viscosity .",
    "we note that @xmath36 is the angular momentum of an annulus between @xmath37 and d@xmath37 .",
    "hence the equation ( 2 ) multiplied with @xmath38 gives how the angular momentum of the annulus changes by the viscous torque .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the viscous torque at the radial distance @xmath37 .",
    "it is normally assumed that the term @xmath41 gives the velocity shear .",
    "however for the accretion disk , @xmath42 in which @xmath43 is associated with pure rotation , and @xmath44 gives the shear .",
    "therefore , the viscous stress is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the coefficient of viscosity .",
    "then the viscous torque is @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath49 is the volume density . therefore using the equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 )",
    ", we get @xmath50 the equations ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) govern the accretion disk dynamics .",
    "if the disk is nearly keplerian , then these two equations can be combined to get @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation gives the time evolution of the accretion disk .",
    "let us now consider a special case , viz .",
    ", a steady ( @xmath52 ) geometrically thin accretion disk . from the equations ( 1 ) and ( 6 )",
    ", we get @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants . for a steady disk ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is @xmath57 .",
    "therefore from equation ( 8) , @xmath58 in order to calculate @xmath56 , we consider a boundary condition @xmath59 let us justify this condition for the following two cases : ( 1 ) when the disk is extended up to the stellar surface , and ( 2 ) when the star is well inside the disk , and the matter falls from the disk inner edge towards the star quasi - radially . for a near - keplerian disk ,",
    "the angular speed @xmath43 increases with the decrease of @xmath37 . for the first case ,",
    "since the stellar angular speed is less than keplerian ( otherwise the star would break up ) , the disk @xmath43 must decrease with the decrease of @xmath37 close to the star .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 must be zero at some point ( assumed to be @xmath61 ) near the stellar surface .",
    "on the other hand , for the second case , the torque at the disk inner edge is expected to vanish ( note : it may not be exactly true in reality ) making @xmath62 .",
    "the region ( between the star and the disk ) in which the flow deviates considerably from keplerian is called the boundary layer . from the equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the stellar mass . substituting this in the equation ( 9 ) , and using the equations ( 8) and ( 10 ) ,",
    "we get , @xmath65.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that the accretion rate is greater for larger viscosity .",
    "the viscous dissipation in the accretion disk causes the emission from the disk , and the source of this emitted energy is the gravitational potential energy release .",
    "this viscous dissipation rate per unit volume of the accretion disk is @xmath66 . integrating this over the disk thickness and assuming keplerian angular speed",
    ", we get the rate of energy emitted per unit area of the disk from equation ( 13 ) : @xmath67.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the total power emitted from a disk extending from @xmath68 to infinity is @xmath69 this shows that , for a steady geometrically thin accretion disk in newtonian gravity , half of the gravitational potential energy is emitted by viscous dissipation in the disk , and the rest half remains stored in the accreted matter as the kinetic energy , and gets dissipated in the boundary layer .",
    "it is expected that a geometrically thin keplerian disk should emit like a blackbody .",
    "therefore , the temperature @xmath70 of the disk surface can be calculated from equation ( 14 ) : @xmath71\\}^{1/4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . as the blackbody temperature varies with the radial distance ,",
    "the spectrum from a disk is known as multicolor blackbody . for luminous lmxbs",
    ", the x - rays from the neutron star boundary layer and the inner part of the accretion disk can substantially irradiate the disk surface .",
    "this irradiation temperature @xmath73 ( which is blackbody temperature ) is proportional to @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the net effective disk temperature is @xmath75^{1/4}$ ] , in which @xmath70 dominates for the inner portion ( that emits x - rays ) of the disk , and @xmath73 dominates far away from the neutron star .",
    "note that the latter can have significant consequences for the disk instability @xcite .",
    "a class of neutron star lmxbs are called transients .",
    "these sources have two distinctly different intensity states : ( 1 ) the quiescent state in which the source remains for months to years ; and ( 2 ) the outburst state which continues for weeks to months ( sometimes for years ; e.g. , for the source ks 1731 - 260 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the source typically increases by several orders of magnitude as it evolves from the quiescent state into an outburst .",
    "3 shows the long term intensity profile of such a transient 1a 1744 - 361 , exhibiting two clear outbursts .",
    "the transient nature of these lmxbs is normally attributed to an accretion disk instability , that causes high accretion rates for certain periods of time , and almost no accretion during other times ( see king 2001 @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these sources are often not detectable in their quiescent states , and in some cases when they are detectable , the poor statistics due to the small number of observed photons hinders a detailed study . for most of the scientific purposes ,",
    "it is therefore preferable to observe these transients during their outbursts .",
    "new transients are also typically discovered during the outburst states .",
    "however , it can not normally be predicted when a transient will come out of its quiescent state .",
    "therefore , instruments with large field of view that can monitor the entire sky almost continuously are required to find the transients in their outbursts .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "asm is such a very useful instrument , that has discovered many new transient lmxbs , as well as detected subsequent outbursts of them .",
    "however , there are scientific reasons that motivate the observations of transient neutron star lmxbs in their quiescent states . for example , during the quiescence , the neutron star surface should be the primary x - ray emitting component , which can be modelled to constrain the stellar radius .",
    "besides , a long outburst heats up the neutron star crust taking it out of thermal equilibrium with the rest of the star .",
    "therefore , tracking the lmxb system going into the quiescence , and the analysis of the quiescent x - ray data can provide a unique opportunity to probe some aspects of the neutron star extreme physics ( e.g. , cackett et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for example",
    ", such a study allows one to compare the observed neutron star cooling rate with the theoretical cooling curve , that involves the physics of stellar constituents .",
    "note that the satellites ( e.g. , _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ ) with high sensitivity imaging instruments are used to observe the sources in quiescence .",
    "many neutron star lmxb systems show a spectacular eruption in x - rays every few hours to days . during these bursts ,",
    "the observed x - ray intensity goes up sharply in @xmath76 seconds , and decays relatively slowly in @xmath77 seconds ( see fig .",
    "4 ; strohmayer & bildsten @xcite ) . the typical energy emitted in a few seconds during such",
    "a burst is @xmath78 ergs ( note that the sun takes more than a week to release this energy ) .",
    "these bursts are known as type - i or thermonuclear bursts , and were first discovered in 1970 s @xcite . soon after their discovery it was realized that they originate from recurrent unstable nuclear burning of accreted matter on the neutron star surfaces @xcite .",
    "the neutron star surface origin was supported by the observational fact that the burst emission area ( estimated from the energy spectrum of the bursts ) matched with the expected surface area of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "although , a competetive emission area could be the inner portion of the accretion disk , nuclear ignition in order to produce the observed bursts can not occur in such a rare medium .",
    "but what shows that the nuclear burning causes the bursts ? before coming to that point , we would like to convince the readers that such a nuclear burning has to be unstable .",
    "this is because , while the nuclear energy released per nucleon by fusion is only a few mev , the gravitational energy release by a nucleon falling on the neutron star surface from a large distance is @xmath79 ( @xmath64 and @xmath80 are neutron star mass and radius respectively ) , which is typically @xmath81 mev .",
    "therefore , the energy released from a stable burning of the accreted matter would be entirely lost in the observed gravitational energy .",
    "so the nuclear burning can power the bursts , only if the accreted matter accumulates on the neutron star surface for a long time , and then burns quickly in an unstable manner .",
    "this instability appears if the nuclear energy generation rate is more temperature sensitive than the radiative cooling rate . for an observed data set from a given source , the ratio of the total energy content in all the bursts to that in the non - burst emission roughly tallies with the expected nuclear energy release ( per nucleon ) to the expected gravitational energy release ( per nucleon ) ratio @xcite",
    "this is one of the strongest evidences of the nuclear energy origin of the bursts .",
    "here we note that , only a year before these bursts were discovered , hansen and van horn @xcite predicted that thin hydrogen and helium layers on neutron star surfaces could be susceptible to the above mentioned instability @xcite .",
    "the accreted material consists of mostly hydrogen , some helium and a small amount of heavier elements , except when the donor companion is a white dwarf .",
    "this matter , that accumulates on the neutron star surface , undergoes hydrostatic compression as more and more material piles on , and the ignition density and temperature are reached in a few hours to days .",
    "the burning typically happens at a depth of @xmath82 m at a column density of @xmath83 gm @xmath84 . the compression rate and the ignition depends on the accretion rate , which sets four distinct regimes of burning @xcite . _",
    "regime 1 _ : in most cases , the temperature of the accumulated material exceeds @xmath85 k , and hence the hydrogen burns via the cno cycle instead of the proton - proton ( pp ) cycle .",
    "this causes mixed hydrogen and helium bursts triggered by the unstable hydrogen ignition , which happens for the accretion rate per unit neutron star surface area m @xmath86 gm @xmath84 sec@xmath87 ( @xmath88)@xmath89 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath90 is the mass fraction of cno . _",
    "regime 2 _ : at higher temperatures ( @xmath91 k ) , the proton capture timescale becomes shorter than the subsequent @xmath92 decay lifetimes .",
    "hence , the hydrogen burns via the  hot \" cno cycle of fowler & hoyle @xcite : @xmath93 in this case , the hydrogen burning happens in a thermally stable manner ( i.e. , without triggering a thermonuclear burst ) simultaneously with the accumulation of matter .",
    "this allows a helium layer to build up below the hydrogen layer . for the m range @xmath94 gm @xmath84",
    "sec@xmath87 ( @xmath88)@xmath95 m @xmath96 gm @xmath84 sec@xmath87 ( @xmath88)@xmath97 , the hydrogen becomes entirely burned before this helium is ignited @xcite .",
    "so when the helium ignition happens , a short ( @xmath9 sec ) but very intense burst occurs by the unstable triple - alpha reaction of the pure helium ( @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 ) .",
    "such a burst is called a  helium burst \" . many of these bursts are so intense , that the local x - ray luminosity in the neutron star atmosphere may exceed the eddington limit ( for which the radiative pressure force balances the gravitational force ) , and the photospheric layers may be lifted off the neutron star surface .",
    "such bursts are called photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts .",
    "_ regime 3 _ : for m @xmath101 gm @xmath84 sec@xmath87 ( @xmath88)@xmath97 , hydrogen burns via the  hot \" cno cycle in a stable manner ( as for the regime 2 ) , but enough unburnt hydrogen remains present at the time of helium ignition .",
    "this is because at this higher accretion rate , the helium ignition conditions are satisfied much sooner .",
    "therefore in this regime , mixed hydrogen and helium bursts are triggered by the helium ignition .",
    "during such a burst , the thermal instability can produce elements beyond the iron group @xcite via the rapid - proton ( rp ) process of wallace & woosley @xcite .",
    "this process burns hydrogen via successive proton capture and @xmath92 decays .",
    "the long series of @xmath92 decays makes these bursts typically much longer ( @xmath102 sec ) than the helium bursts . _",
    "regime 4 _ : finally at a very high accretion rate ( comparable to the eddington limit ) , the helium burning temperature sensitivity becomes weaker than the cooling rate s sensitivity @xcite .",
    "therefore in this regime , the stable burning sets in , and the thermonuclear bursts do not occur .    apart from type - i x - ray bursts , another type of thermonuclear x - ray bursts with much larger recurrence time ( @xmath6 years ) has been observed . these are called superbursts , and they differ from the type - i bursts also in the decay time ( @xmath103 hours ) and the amount of released energy ( @xmath104 ergs ) .",
    "the first superburst was discovered by cornelisse et al .",
    "@xcite from the known type - i burster 4u 1735 - 44 .",
    "so far about 15 superbursts have been detected from 10 sources @xcite .",
    "it is believed that these bursts of large fluence happen by the @xmath105 fusion reaction at a column depth of @xmath106 gm @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "however , currently our understanding of superbursts is not as clear as that of type - i bursts .",
    "thermonuclear bursts provide a unique opportunity to study some aspects of extreme physics .",
    "moreover , such a study brings together several branches of physics : nuclear physics , astrophysics , general theory of relativity , magnetohydrodynamics , etc .",
    "these bursts can also be useful to constrain the neutron star parameters , and hence to understand the nature of the stellar core matter at supranuclear densities ( see the spectral and timing properties of these bursts in later sections ) .",
    "therefore , the thermonuclear bursts belong to a truly multidisciplinary field , which is not yet well understood .",
    "one such poorly explored aspect of these bursts is the thermonuclear flame spreading on the neutron star surfaces .",
    "burst is ignited at a certain location on the stellar surface , and then the burning region expands to cover the entire surface @xcite .",
    "the theoretical modeling of thermonuclear flame spreading including all the main physical effects is extremely difficult , and only recently spitkovsky et al .",
    "@xcite have provided some insights in this field . although these authors have ignored several physical effects ( magnetic field , strong gravity , etc . ) in their model , they have considered the effects of the coriolis force , which is important as the bursting neutron stars are rapidly spinning ( spin frequency @xmath20 hz ) .",
    "the observational study of flame spreading is also no less difficult than the theoretical study .",
    "this is because , this spreading mostly happens within @xmath2 sec during the burst rise , and in order to study it observationally , one needs to detect and measure the evolution of the burst spectral and timing properties during this short time .",
    "only recently this has been possible for a few bursts by analyzing the _ rxte _ pca data @xcite .",
    "moreover , an indication of the effects of the coriolis force on the flame spreading ( as predicted by spitkovsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) has also been found @xcite .",
    "a series of bursts , known as type - ii x - ray bursts , are observed from neutron star lmxbs in quick succession . to the best of our knowledge , only two such systems ( rapid burster and gro j1744 - 28 ) exhibit these bursts @xcite .",
    "the intervals between the bursts vary between seconds to @xmath107 hour , and the burst duration is in the range of seconds to minutes .",
    "the typical emitted energy range during a burst from the rapid burster is @xmath108 ergs to @xmath109 ergs @xcite .",
    "these bursts often show successive peaks and flat tops .",
    "note that a source is not always active for type - ii x - ray bursts , and a series of such bursts are observed in certain periods of time .",
    "type - ii x - ray bursts are distinctly different from the type - i bursts in many ways .",
    "for example , the latter bursts show a spectral softening during burst decay , while the former bursts lack this signature .",

    "the continuum burst spectra are thermal , and in most cases they are quite well described with a blackbody model @xcite .",

    "an understanding of these changes will be essential to ( 1 ) measure the neutron star radius using the burst continuum spectrum , ( 2 ) understand the nuclear physics of bursts , and ( 3 ) probe the magnetohydrodynamics of the burning layer and the atmosphere .      in order to probe the nature of the bulge that causes dips ,",

    "a simple increase in the neutral absorber column density from its persistent emission value can not explain the dip spectra . currently , there are two competing spectral models to explain dips .",

    "note that , although the spectral features are mostly seen from high inclination lmxbs , this plasma must be common to all lmxbs , and hence these features will be useful in understanding lmxbs in general .",
    "broad asymmetric spectral iron emission line has been observed from many accreting supermassive and stellar - mass black hole systems @xcite .",

    "the observed iron k@xmath125 line near 6.4 kev is the strongest fluorescent line from such a system . as the matter in the inner accretion disk rotates very fast , and is close to the black hole , doppler effect broadens the line , special relativistic beaming makes it asymmetric , and the gravitational redshift shifts it towards the lower energies .",

    "it was suspected that such a line might have an origin similar to that of the broad iron line from black hole systems",
    ". however , the asymmetry of these lines was not established , and hence their origin was not well understood .",
    "recently , bhattacharyya & strohmayer @xcite have , for the first time , established the inner disk origin of such a line from the neutron star lmxb serpens x-1 ( see fig .",

    "however , the evidence of the  reflection \" component of the x - ray spectrum is still marginal @xcite , which the theory and the future observations should address .      observing atomic spectral lines from the surface of a neutron star",
    "has been one of the long - standing goals of the neutron star astrophysics .",
    "this is because , such an observation and the identification of the line provide the cleanest way to measure the neutron star radius - to - mass ratio using the following formula ( for the schwartzschild spacetime appropriate for a non - spinning neutron star ) : @xmath126^{-1/2}$ ] @xcite . here",

    "as the neutron stars in lmxb systems typically spin with high frequencies ( @xmath20 hz ) , doppler effect and special relativistic beaming should make the lines broad and asymmetric ( similar to the lines from disks mentioned in the previous section ) .",
    "measuring @xmath129 accurately from such a broad line ( for which the definition of @xmath128 is not certain ) using the above formula is difficult .",
    "bhattacharyya et al .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested a way to measure the stellar @xmath129 using the above formula from such lines .",

    "bhattacharyya et al .",
    "@xcite have found that the ratio of energy contents of these peaks ( or , dips ) contains information about the general relativistic frame - dragging .",
    "therefore , surface atomic lines can be used to test the theory of general relativity in the strong gravity regime .",
    "surface lines are likely to be detected from thermonuclear x - ray bursts and hence from neutron stars in lmxb systems .",
    "this is because : ( 1 ) the continuous accretion and the radiative pressure may keep the line - forming heavy elements in the stellar atmosphere for the time - duration required for the line detection ; ( 2 ) the relatively low magnetic fields ( @xmath130 gauss ) of the neutron stars in lmxbs should make the line identification easier by keeping the magnetic splitting negligible ; ( 3 ) the lower magnetic field does not complicate the modeling of the atmosphere ; ( 4 ) the luminous bursts give good signal - to - noise ratio ; and ( 5 ) during the bursts , typically 90% of the total emission originate from the neutron star surface , and hence the surface spectral line may be largely free from the uncertainty due to the other x - ray emission components , such as the accretion disk .",
    "indeed , the only plausible observation of the neutron star surface atomic spectral lines was from an lmxb exo 0748 - 676 @xcite .",
    "these authors detected two significant absorption features in the _ xmm - newton _ rgs energy spectra of the thermonuclear x - ray bursts , which they identified as fe xxvi and fe xxv @xmath131 lines with a redshift of @xmath132 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . in order to detect these lines",
    ", they had to combine the spectra of 28 bursts .",
    "the identification of these two lines as the surface atomic spectral lines is reasonable for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the early burst phases ( when the temperature was higher ) showed the fe xxvi line , while the late burst phases ( when the temperature was lower ) showed the fe xxv line .",
    "this is consistent with qualitative temperature dependence of the iron ionization states .",
    "( 2 ) the narrow lines were consistent with the relatively slow spin rate of the neutron star ( 45 hz ; villarreal & strohmayer @xcite ) .",
    "( 3 ) both the lines showed the same surface gravitational redshift , as expected .",
    "this redshift is reasonable for the surface of a typical neutron star .",
    "the absorption of some of the bursts photons ( originated in deep burning layers ) by the iron ions in the upper atmosphere might give rise to these redshifted lines .",
    "chang et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed strength of the iron lines could be produced by a neutron star photospheric metallicity , which was @xmath133 times larger than the solar metallicity .",
    "however , these lines were not significantly detected from the new data from the later observations of the same source .",
    "although , this casts doubts in the reality of these lines , it may be caused by the change in the photospheric conditions that might weaken the lines .",
    "therefore , the evidence of the existence of surface atomic lines currently remains uncertain , which , given the importance of these lines , provides the motivation for the future generation x - ray instruments .",
    "a convenient way to study how the persistent spectrum of a neutron star lmxb changes with time , and how it is correlated with various timing properties and the occurrence of other features ( e.g. , thermonuclear x - ray bursts ) , is to compute the color - color diagram . in order to do this ,",
    "typically five photon energies with increasing values are considered : @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "let us assume that the observed background - subtracted photon count numbers in the ranges @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 respectively .",
    "then we define soft color @xmath147 and hard color @xmath148 .",
    "the color - color diagram is a plot of hard color vs. soft color , which shows the change of spectral hardness of the source .",
    "neutron star lmxbs can be divided into two classes based on their color - color diagrams : the so called  z sources \" , that show distinct z - like curves ( fig .",
    "8) , and the  atoll sources \" , that exhibit c - like curves ( fig .",
    "these two types of curves are not only different by shape , but also they are correlated with distinctly different timing properties @xcite . apart from these differences , the z sources are very luminous ( luminosities are close to eddington ) , while the luminosities of the atoll sources typically remain between @xmath149 of the eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "the three branches of a z curve , from upper to lower , are called horizontal branch ( hb ) , normal branch ( nb ) and flaring branch ( fb ) .",
    "the lower part of a typical atoll curve is called the banana state , while the upper part is known as the island state .",
    "the x - ray luminosity typically increases from hb to fb for a z source , and from island state to banana state for an atoll source .",
    "we note that , although the various characteristics of the color - color diagrams are observationally very robust , most of them are not yet theoretically well understood . accretion rate is known to be a parameter that changes along the z curves and the atoll curves .",
    "but , given the complex properties of these curves , more parameters must be involved in the fundamental level .",
    "it is also not understood what , apart from the accretion rate , distinguishes between the z and atoll properties .",
    "the recent discovery of the first transient z source , that shows substantially changed properties at lower luminosities , holds the promise to take our understanding of these sources to a higher level @xcite .",
    "most of the radio pulsars ( that are spinning neutron stars emitting periodic radio pulses ) have spin period @xmath150 milliseconds , and high magnetic field ( typically @xmath151 gauss ) .",
    "these are relatively young neutron stars .",

    "but years of searching did not yield the detection of any such coherent millisecond - period x - ray pulsations . finally in 1998 , the first millisecond x - ray pulsations ( with the frequency @xmath154 hz ) were discovered from the transient lmxb sax j1808.4 - 3658 with the _ rxte _ satellite @xcite . as x - ray pulsations ( like the radio pulsations ) measure the neutron star spin frequency",

    "the narrow peak at the frequency of 442.36 hz shows the pulsations .",
    "note that the computation of a power spectrum is a convenient way to detect timing features .",
    "such a spectrum ( power vs. frequency ) is a fourier transform of the intensity profile ( photon counts vs. time ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath155 is the number of photons detected in bin @xmath156 , then the discrete fourier transform @xmath157 decomposes the intensity into @xmath158 sine waves .",
    "the direct and the inverse fourier transforms are then given by : @xmath159        in the lmxbs containing these pulsars , the accretion flow is channeled by the neutron star magnetic field to the magnetic polar cap .",
    "the x - ray hot spot on the neutron star created by this channeled flow rotates around the stellar spin axis ( if the magnetic axis and the spin axis are misaligned ) and gives rise to the observed x - ray pulses .",
    "since the gravitational energy release from the accreted matter powers the x - ray pulsations , these sources are called  accretion - powered millisecond pulsars ( amps ) \" . since the first discovery of these pulsars",

    "high frequency timing features are observed from many ( so far about 20 ) neutron star lmxbs during thermonuclear x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "they are called  burst oscillations \" , and were first discovered with the _ rxte _ pca instrument in bursts from the lmxb 4u 1728 - 34 @xcite .",

    "in fact , regular pulsations and burst oscillations are the only methods to measure the spin rates of neutron stars in lmxbs , and together they have provided spin frequencies of about 25 sources . apart from measuring the stellar spin",

    "continuum power , in excess of the mean random power , is often observed at frequencies less than 100 hz .",
    "the nature of this power depends on the source state determined from the position on the color - color plot .",
    "for example , a power - law - like continuum ( @xmath161 ; @xmath162 is the frequency in the power spectrum ; and @xmath125 is a constant ) below 1 hz is typically dominant for the atoll sources in the end part of the banana state @xcite .",
    "apart from the broad continua , neutron star lmxbs often exhibit peaked features with a wide range of frequencies ( millihertz to kilohertz ) .",
    "since they are somewhat broad , and hence not quite periodic , these features are known as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "similar to the continuum features , qpos are correlated with the color - color diagram .",

    "<S> a neutron star low - mass x - ray binary is a binary stellar system with a neutron star and a low - mass companion star rotating around each other . in this system </S>",
    "<S> the neutron star accretes mass from the companion , and as this matter falls into the deep potential well of the neutron star , the gravitational potential energy is released primarily in the x - ray wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> such a source was first discovered in x - rays in 1962 , and this discovery formally gave birth to the  x - ray astronomy \" . in the subsequent decades </S>",
    "<S> , our knowledge of these sources has increased enormously by the observations with several x - ray space missions . here </S>",
    "<S> we give a brief overview of our current understanding of the x - ray observational aspects of these systems . </S>"
