    "the conversion of gas to stars is determined by the star formation process , the outcome of which are stars with a variety of masses .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses in a given volume of space at the time of their formation is known as the initial mass function ( imf ) , given that all stars were born simultaneously .",
    "the imf dictates the evolution and fate of stellar systems , as well as of whole galaxies .",
    "the evolution of a stellar system is driven by the relative initial numbers of stars of various masses , from the short - lived high - mass stars ( @xmath0  -2.truept  8 m ) , which enrich the ism with elements heavier than h and he , to the low - mass stars ( @xmath0  -2.truept  1 m ) , which lock large amounts of mass over long timescales .",
    "it is therefore of much importance to quantify the relative numbers of stars in different mass ranges and to identify systematic variations of the imf with different star - forming conditions , which will allow us to understand the physics involved in assembling each of the mass ranges .",
    "there are various parameterizations of the imf ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) , of which a commonly used is that of a power law of the form @xmath1 , or alternatively @xmath2 .",
    "the imf , thus , is characterized by the derivatives @xmath3 depending on whether stars are distributed according to their masses in logarithmic or linear scales .",
    "the above derivatives , which relate to each other as @xmath4 , correspond to the so - called slope of the imf . a reference value for the imf slope , as found by @xcite in the solar neighborhood for stars with masses between 0.4 and 10 m , is @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) .",
    "in general , although the imf appears relatively uniform when averaged over whole clusters or large regions of galaxies ( @xcite ) , the measured imf shows local spatial variations , which could be the result of physical differences , or even purely statistical in nature ( @xcite ) .",

    "the shaded regions represent the uncertainties of the mf .",
    "the corresponding mf slopes @xmath8 are given for stars up to the higher observed mass , which in the region of the system is @xmath9  28  m. the slope of the imf of lh  95 is a bit shallower than a @xcite imf because of its high - mass content .",

    "* gouliermis et al . 2003 ) ) , located at regions of recent star formation in the lmc form a complete sample of targets with various characteristics for the study of the stellar imf in this galaxy .",
    "therefore , the lmc , being so close to us , has provided an ideal alternative environment for the study of extragalactic star formation and the derived imf .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic investigations of young stellar associations in the lmc , limited so far to ground - based observations , revealed that the imf of the high - mass stars in these systems is consistent from one system to the other .",
    "all measured imf slopes are found to be clustered around the salpeter value , not very different from that of ob associations of our galaxy ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* massey 2006 ) ) , suggesting that the massive imf appears more or less to be universal with a typical salpeter slope ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* massey 2003 ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that there are small but observable differences in the constructed imf and its slope between different systems , which may imply that the imf is probably determined by the local physical conditions ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hill et al .",
    "1995 ) ) , or that the variability in the slope of the imf could be the result of different star formation processes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* parker et al . 1998 ) ) .",
    "however , taking into account the constraints in the construction of the imf , one may argue that the imf variations are possibly observational and/or statistical in nature ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "an example of the spatial dependence of the imf and the effect of the contamination by the field population is demonstrated in fig .",

    "complete investigations concerning the low - mass stars are so far available only for the galactic imf , which is found to become flat in the sub - solar regime ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reid 1998 ) ) , down to the detection limit of 0.1  m or lower ( @xcite ) . observed variations from one region of the galaxy to the next in the numbers of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs over intermediate- and high - mass stars affect the corresponding imf , which seems to depend on the position ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "explanations suggested for the low - mass imf variations include stochasticity in the ages and ejection rates of proto - stars from dense clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , differences in the photo - evaporation rate from high - mass neighboring stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , or a dependence of the jeans mass on column density ( @xcite ) or mach number ( @xcite ) , and they may also be affected by variations in the binary fraction ( @xcite ) .",
    "while the discussion over the low - mass part of the galactic imf continues , more information on the imf toward smaller masses in other galaxies is required for the understanding of its dependence on the global properties of the host - galaxy and for addressing the issue of its universality .",
    "the lmc , due to its proximity , can serve as the best proxy for the study of extragalactic young low - mass stellar populations , and due to its global differences from the milky way , it provides a convenient alternative environment for the investigation of the imf variability . under these circumstances , issues that should be addressed",
    "can be summarized to _ what is the low - mass stellar population of young stellar associations in the lmc _",
    ", _ what is the shape of the corresponding imf _ , and _ how it compares to that of the milky way_. a substantial amount of such information in both the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) was thus far lacking , mostly due to observational limitations .",

    "subsequent photometry with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) of the association ngc  346 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) led to the discovery of an extraordinary number of low - mass pms stars in its vicinity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , providing the required statistical sample for the investigation of the clustering behavior ( @xcite ) and the imf ( @xcite ) of these stars .    our photometric study of another young smc star cluster , ngc  602 , with _",
