    "the production of single prompt photons of large transverse momenta in high energy hadronic collisions constitutes unique signal of the interactions between quarks and gluons at short distances .",
    "@xcite the single prompt photon yield is expected to be sensitive to parton distribution function ( pdf ) in general and to gluon distribution in particular of the colliding hadron  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "it is also considered an essential ingredient to quantify the nuclear modification of direct photon production in the relativistic nucleus  nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "the word promptis used to identify the class of photons which do not come from the decay of large momenta hadrons ( e.g. , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . ) .",
    "the basic mechanisms of prompt photon production at the leading - order ( lo ) of strong coupling @xmath1 are ( i ) quark  gluon compton scattering ( qg@xmath5 q@xmath6 ) , ( ii ) quark  anti - quark annihilation ( qq@xmath5 g@xmath6 ) and ( iii ) bremsstrahlung radiation from the final state parton ( q(g)@xmath5 q(g)+@xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "because of the the point - like coupling , the photons produced through the processes ( i ) and ( ii ) are called directphotons .",
    "the direct photons are often calculated using perturbative quantum chromodyanmics ( pqcd ) which successfully explains the production of particles with energy e @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "the photons originated from the process ( iii ) are called fragmentationphotons .",
    "the evaluation of this contribution requires non - perturbative parton to photon fragmentation function as an input along with pqcd .",
    "however , at this point we must state that the distinction is renormalization scheme dependent and has no physical implication beyond lo . a complete next - to leading order ( nlo ) theory",
    "is needed to explain the single and double prompt photon data in hadronic collisions  @xcite .",
    "the momentum fraction probed by the prompt photons of transverse momentum @xmath9 for proton - proton ( ) collisions at mid - rapidity ( y= 0 ) is given by ; @xmath10 where @xmath0 is the center of mass energy .",
    "the photon production is more sensitive to the gluon distribution at low @xmath9 ( i.e. , small @xmath11 ) and to the valance quark distribution towards higher @xmath9 ( i.e. , large @xmath11 ) for a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "thus one can hope to determine the gluon distribution g(@xmath11,q@xmath12 ) unambiguously from the very accurate prompt photon data .",
    "the present work is aimed to verify the above assumptions . for this purpose",
    ", we have considered the isolated prompt photon production in collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) ( @xmath0= 200 gev ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( @xmath0= 7 tev ) energies .",
    "the isolated prompt photon cross section is found more advantageous than the inclusive prompt photon cross section  @xcite .",
    "the collider experiments always perform isolated photon measurement to identify the prompt photon signal from the large background of secondary decay photons .",
    "in addition , the isolation criterion makes the total photon cross section much less sensitive to the non - perturbative fragmentation process enabling us to study the small @xmath11 behaviour of gluon distribution more precisely .",
    "a photon is said to be isolated if the accompanying hadronic transverse energy ( @xmath13 ) inside the isolation cone is less than some specified value ( @xmath14 ) ; [ iso ] where we considered a cone of radius r ( = @xmath15 ) in the rapidity ( @xmath16 ) and the azimuthal angle ( @xmath17 ) space about the photon direction .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the qcd factorization theorem is valid in all orders of perturbation theory with the above general isolation criterion ( eq .  [ iso ] ) .",
    "hence the isolated prompt photon cross section is a pertubatively well defined quantity like the inclusive case . in experiment ,",
    "sometimes the isolation energy is expressed in terms of a dimensionless parameter @xmath18 .",
    "we write the single isolated prompt photon production cross section as  @xcite : e_(y_,p _ , ) = _ i , j dx_1",
    "f_i / a(x_1,_f^2 ) dx_2 f_j / b(x_2,_f^2 ) + _ c = q , g d_c/(z,^2_f ) ^iso_ij cx ( p_c , x_1,x_2 ; z_c , ; _",
    "f,_r,_f ) ( z - z_c ) , [ cross ] where the _ f _ s are called the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) which give the probability for the incoming partons i and j carrying momentum fractions @xmath19 and @xmath20 inside the hadrons a and b respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is giving the parton to photon fragmentation probability defined at @xmath22 .",
    "when a photon is emitted from directhard interaction ( i.e. @xmath23 ) , the photon fragmentation function reduces to @xmath24 . following the isolation criterion  ( [ iso ] )",
    "; we find that the fraction @xmath25 should be @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "thus for small values of @xmath27 , the fragmentation process is less contributory to the total photon cross section compared to the direct process .",
    "this is contrary to the inclusive prompt photon production .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath21 appears in eq .",
    "[ cross ] is the same as in case of inclusive photons .",
    "@xmath28 is the isolated partonic interaction cross section , contains all process upto @xmath29 ( for @xmath23 ) and upto @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) of the reaction @xmath32 .",
    "the dependence of the isolation parameters ( r , @xmath27 ) are fully encoded into the isolated cross section ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "@xmath33 are the three different scales associated with the factorization , renormalization and fragmentation respectively .",
    "with this theoretical introduction , now we show the results of isolated prompt photon production for collisions at the rhic and lhc center of mass energies (  fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "our calculation is based on the monte carlo programme ` jetphox `  @xcite which evaluates direct and fragmentation photon cross - section separately at nlo accuracy .",
    "we sum the two contributions to get the total physical cross section at nlo . `",
    "jetphox ` has been found to explain the isolated prompt photon data at the tevatron energy  @xcite and at the lhc energy  @xcite .",
    "this programme is very useful in the sense that one can define variety of experimental requirements ( kinematic , isolation ) at the partonic level .",
    "numerous sets of pdf are made available in ` jetphox ` through the lhapdf library  @xcite .",
    "we have considered isolation cone of radius r@xmath34 0.4 and constant isolation energy cut in these studies .",
    "the parameters of calculations at the rhic are ; @xmath9= 420 gev , @xmath35 0.5 , @xmath14= 2 gev and at the lhc are ; @xmath9= 10200 gev , @xmath35 1.5 , @xmath14= 5 gev .",
    "we have used the bfg - i parton to photon fragmentation function by bourhis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite which includes correction in the fragmentation function beyond leading logerthemic approximation .",
    "the three scales @xmath33 are set equal to a common scale @xmath36 , to reduce theoretical uncertainties in the calculation . the scale @xmath36 further defined as c@xmath9 with c= 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 . the scale dependence of the isolated prompt photon production , calculated with ct10 pdf  @xcite is shown in  fig.[fig1 ]",
    "the results have been plotted against the prompt photon measurement by the phenix collaboration at mid - rapidity  @xcite and by the cms collaboration in the rapidity range 0.9 @xmath371.44  @xcite .",
    "our results quite agree with the theoretical curve mentioned in refs .",
    "the scale @xmath38 is found to be a better choice though the relative uncertainty between the scales is found to be very small .",
    "next we have considered four more different parameterizations of pdf namely ; cteq4 m  @xcite , cteq6 m  @xcite , mrst2001  @xcite and nnpdf1.0  @xcite .",
    "our motivation is to check whether the single prompt photon yield is able to distinguish between these pdf sets .",
    "we do hope that the recent prompt photon measurements at the rhic and lhc experiments can constrain the gluon density in the proton . the invariant prompt photon yield calculated with the five pdf s at the rhic and the lhc energies",
    "are displayed in  fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we see that starting from very old parameterization like ; cteq4 m to a recent parameterization like ; ct10 gives reasonably good description of the data within the statistical errors .",
    "a little wiggling observed at different theoretical curves for @xmath39 12 gev at the rhic and for @xmath39 120 gev at the lhc can be attributed to the monte carlo technique of integration .",
    "the direct and fragmentation contributions to the isolated photon cross section ( @xmath40 ) at nlo are shown individually in  fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the nlo corrections to the direct contribution is due to additional real and virtual gluon emission at the lo processes qg@xmath5 q@xmath6 and qq@xmath5 g@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the nlo correction to the fragmentation is coming from evaluation of generic @xmath30 subprocesses ; @xmath41 where the parton c fragments into a photon  @xcite .",
    "all these higher oder corrections are included in ` jetphox ` according to the @xmath42 renormalization and factorization scheme .",
    "it is known indeed that the total cross section is only the physical quantity at nlo because a direct @xmath29 process like ; qg@xmath5 qg@xmath6 contributes the same as lo fragmentation process when the fragmentation scale @xmath43 is close to 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "we expect qg ( or qg ) initiated directphotons could be a good probe to track down the varying gluon distribution g(@xmath11,q@xmath12 ) among the pdf sets .",
    "however as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we have not found any dependence of the direct and fragmentation contributions to pdf at the rhic and the lhc energies .",
    "the fragmentation contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is scaled down by a factor of 10 for better visibility .",
    "we find the direct component has dominant contribution ( @xmath44 8090% ) to the total photon cross section at the rhic and the lhc energies .",
    "still now we have plotted our results on logerthemic scale which can easily consume a factor of 23 difference among the pdf s . to measure the deviation in the isolated prompt photon yield of different pdf sets ,",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46refers to the isolated prompt photon cross section calculated with cteq4 m .",
    "the @xmath47refers to the same calculated with cteq6 m , ct10 , mrst2001 and nnpdf1.0 .",
    "thus , the cteq4 m is chosen as the central value and @xmath48 measures the deviation as we go towards newer structure functions .",
    "the dependence of @xmath49 with @xmath9 at the rhic and the lhc energies , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    apart from the numerical fluctuations , we find all the pdf s show a monotonic variation with @xmath9 e.g. , @xmath48 of cteq6 m first decreases for @xmath50 10 gev at the rhic and @xmath51 40 gev at the lhc , then increases with @xmath9 .",
    "the amount of deviation seen is least for mrst2001 and most for nnpdf1.0 .",
    "it is found that the uncertainty in the isolated photon cross section associated with the choice of pdf s is within 20% at the rhic and lhc energy for all @xmath9 .",
    "similar work at the tevatron energy can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the comparison is made with three pdf s and prediction is given for collisions at the top lhc energy ( @xmath0= 14 tev ) .",
    "a recent quantitative study using a particular pdf set and it s replicas at different collider energies has drawn similar conclusion  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have checked the variation of gluon distribution g(@xmath11,q@xmath12 ) among the five different parameterizations of pdf in the kinematic regime , @xmath52 , probed by the present rhic and lhc photon data . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have plotted the momentum density of gluons @xmath11g(@xmath11,q@xmath12 ) vs the momentum fraction @xmath11 for a typical value of q@xmath12= 80 gev@xmath12 .",
    "this shows that the gluon distribution is varying indeed among the five pdf s considered in this study .",
    "we believe that the sensitivity of single prompt photon production to the parton distributions is taken away due to the integration over the initial parton momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 in eq .",
    ".    however , the double prompt photon production cross section in hadronic collisions , is directly proportional to the incoming parton momentum density ( or the pdf )  @xcite .",
    "the double prompt photons produced through quark - anti - quark annihilation qq@xmath53 or gluon - gluon fusion gg@xmath53 completely specify parton momentum distribution .",
    "the single bremsstrahlung contribution like ; qg@xmath5 q@xmath54 to the double photon production is also sensitive to the pdf . hence we hope the double prompt photon measurement at the lhc energy could better probe the gluon distribution g(@xmath11,q@xmath12 ) in the proton in comparison with the single prompt photon measurement .",
    "we have analyzed the data of single prompt photon production cross section in collisions at the center of mass energies 200 gev ( rhic ) and 7 tev ( lhc ) with five different parameterizations of pdf .",
    "our calculation relies on the available programme ` jetphox ` which calculates isolated prompt photon production at the nlo accuracy .",
    "we have shown that the single isolated prompt photon spectra is almost insensitive to the choice of pdf which is due to the intregation over the initial state parton momemta .",
    "the present analysis suggests the recent prompt photon measurement at rhic and lhc can constrain the gluon distribution in the proton not more than 20% of certainty .",
    "we expect the differential production cross section of double prompt photons can determine the gluon distribution more precisely and shall be checked in future studies .",
