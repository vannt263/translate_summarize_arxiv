    "current x - ray space missions , such as chandra and xmm - newton , have produced exceptional science results using charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) in their detector focal planes .",
    "ccds currently provide fano - limited energy resolution ( @xmath2e / e @xmath3 2.0 % at 5.89 kev ) with @xmath4 2 e@xmath5 read noise @xcite .",
    "however , x - ray missions on the horizon , such as smart - x @xcite and/or the x - ray surveyor @xcite , are slated to have larger collecting areas up to 30 times that of current missions , which will increase the x - ray photon rate from even moderate to low flux sources beyond the frame rate of the fastest ccds .",
    "these future high - throughput missions have exciting science goals , which include observing gamma ray bursts in the early universe ( @xmath6 ) to explore cosmic structure , observing bright objects such as blazars to detect faint absorption lines in the warm hot ionized medium ( whim ) , and studying supermassive black holes and their environments up to @xmath7 .",
    "however , current ccd technology will not be adequate for the focal plane requirements of these future high - throughput missions .",
    "we present the characterization of a new hybrid cmos x - ray detector ( hcd ) called the speedster - exd , which offers the fast effective frame rates needed for future high - throughput missions .",
    "hcds are also more radiation hard and have lower power requirements than current ccds .",
    "the speedster detector has new in - pixel features that improve upon previous generation hawaii hcds@xcite , increasing the effective frame rate and performance .",
    "we have developed the speedster to mitigate interpixel capacitance crosstalk ( ipc ) seen on hawaii hcds , and to utilize the in - pixel circuitry capabilities of hcd technology by embedding event - driven circuitry . in this paper , we briefly discuss hcds , including their advantages ( section [ hcd ] ) and characteristics ( section [ chara_astronomy ] ) , followed by the description of the speedster - exd detector and its new features ( section [ sect : speedster ] ) .",
    "we then discuss our testing of the speedster - exd detector ( sections 5 - 7 ) , including its measured ipc ( section [ sect : ipc ] ) , read noise ( section [ read_noise ] ) , energy resolution ( section [ energy_res ] ) , dark current ( section [ sect : dark_current ] ) , and gain variation ( section [ gain_var ] ) .",
    "hybrid cmos detectors ( hcds ) consist of two layers ; an absorbing layer ( silicon or hgcdte depending on the application ) and a readout integrated circuit ( roic ) layer .",
    "the absorbing layer is optimized for high quantum efficiency , and the roic layer is optimized for fast readout and advanced in - pixel electronics .",
    "the two layers are then indium bump bonded together at each pixel .",
    "x - ray hcds use silicon as the absorbing substrate . a thin layer of aluminum is deposited directly on the silicon to block optical light .",
    "a schematic of an x - ray hcd can be seen in figure [ fig : cmos_cartoon ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     with the secondary threshold set to @xmath31@xmath8 , the energy resolution was calculated to be @xmath2e / e = 10.0 @xmath1 0.3 % ( fwhm = 148 @xmath1 5 ev ; figure [ fig : al_fits]b ) .",
    "this single - pixel event spectrum has @xmath350 % fewer events than the spectrum with a secondary threshold equal to 2@xmath8 , but retains the best grade 0 events and thereby gives the best energy resolution .",
    "this measurement is the best energy resolution to date at 1.49 kev on an x - ray hcd .    for sparse readout mode ,",

    "a gain variation map was then created for each detector .",
    "bad pixels were eliminated from the gain variation measurement because they produce bad data and would be masked out when used in any scientific application .",
    "bad pixels are defined as those that are dead or those that have drastically high or low gain ( e.g. mn k@xmath21 peak resides near the full - well or near the noise peak ) . the gain variation for each detector",

    "figure [ ch6-figure : fpa17017_gain_var_map ] displays the spatial gain map for fpa17017 , where brightness corresponds to higher gain . a spatial relation emerges where pixels with low gain are located predominantly in the bottom and left side of the detector . if a boundary of 15 pixels along the left and bottom is excluded ( red box in figure [ ch6-figure : fpa17017_gain_var_map ] ) , the gain variation drops to around 2 % .",
    "this drop in gain variation shows that a significant portion of the low gain pixels are located in the left side and bottom side of the detector .",
    "the precise reason behind the gain variation discrepancy between the two engineering grade detectors is unknown .",
    "after the gain variation on both speedster detectors was characterized , a monte carlo simulation was run to test whether the magnitude of the gain variation could account for the fact that the measured @xmath2e / e is larger than that expected from read noise alone ( see section [ energy_res ] ) .    prior to performing this test , one additional noise factor needs to be taken into consideration .",
    "when taking the gain variation data using the hdl-5 dewar , an increase in noise was identified , relative to the earlier read noise measurement . a read noise calculation",
    "was done on each detector in the hdl-5 dewar , and both detectors showed an increase compared to the measured value reported in section [ read_noise ] .",
    "this noise increase was later found to be from the system vacuum pumps , and will be referred to it as `` pump noise '' . for the simulations in this section",
    ", we refer to the sum of the pump noise and the read noise as @xmath23 .    assuming negligible dark current and gain variation , the theoretical limit of energy resolution on a detector can be found using the equation : @xmath24 where @xmath25 = 3.65 ev / e@xmath5",

    "it is worth noting that the standard fano factor value quoted by authors is 0.11 for silicon@xcite , while one group of authors report a higher value of 0.15@xcite .",
    "slightly different approaches were taken to model the gain variation for each detector .      to model the gain variation on fpa17014",
    ", a gaussian distribution of events was created with the mean equal to the empirically measured mn k@xmath21 mean of 1614 e@xmath5 and the standard deviation equal to the combination , in quadrature , of the deviations from the fano factor term and the measured @xmath23 .",
    "a 64x64 pixel gain variation map was created starting with a random gaussian distribution with a mean at zero percent and using the measured gain variation of fpa17014 ( 0.80 % ) as the standard deviation .",
    "the gaussian distribution of events was convolved through the gain variation map , and the resulting events were histogrammed to create a modeled spectrum .",
    "the spectrum was then fit with a gaussian to calculate the modeled energy resolution .    applying equation [ e_res_theo_limit ] , using the measured @xmath23 in gain 0 mode ( 27 e@xmath5 ) , a theoretical energy resolution limit of @xmath2e / e = 4.4 % was calculated for fpa17014 .",
    "this theoretical limit is much higher than the measured value presented in table [ energy_res_full_14 ] due to the increase in noise seen from the vacuum pumps when using the hdl-5 dewar .",
    "after convolving the modeled spectrum , with the above increased noise , through a gain variation map with gain variation equal to 0.80 % , the modeled spectrum was measured to have a @xmath2e / e = 4.8 @xmath1 0.2 % .",
    "this modeled value is consistent with the measured value with the increased noise , @xmath23 , of @xmath2e / e = 5.0 @xmath1 0.2 % .    assuming the gain variation was the same when we measured the lower read noise in the cube test stand ( see section [ read_noise ] ) , the measured gain 0 read noise ( 15.2 e@xmath5 )",

    "to model the gain variation on fpa17017 , a gain variation map with the same non - gaussian distribution ( figure [ ch6-figure : fpa17017_gain_var_hist ] ) was created for the monte carlo simulation .",
    "a gaussian distribution of x - ray events was created with the mean equal to the theoretical mn k@xmath21 and k@xmath22 mean and the standard deviation equal to the combination , in quadrature , of the deviations from the fano factor term and the measured @xmath23 .",
    "the gaussian distribution of events was convolved through the gain variation map to create a modeled spectrum .",

    "similar to the measured spectrum in figure [ ch6-figure : fpa17017_gain0_grade0_spec ] ( as described in section [ energy_res ] ) , four gaussians were needed to fit the modeled spectrum correctly due to the low energy tail .",

    "we note the existence of an extended low energy tail in the measured spectrum ( figure [ ch6-figure : fpa17017_gain0_grade0_spec ] ) , which is absent from the modeled spectrum ( figure [ ch6-figure : fpa17017_monte_carlo ] ) .",
    "these events are likely to be caused by contamination of the grade 0 event sample with actual grade 1 - 4 events , as well as the possibility of charge loss on the detector when an event is near a bad pixel .",
    "events near bad pixels can be characterized as grade 0 events , when they are in fact grade 1 - 4 events .",

    "other degrading factors , such as contamination of grade 0 events and charge loss , were not modeled on this engineering grade detector .",
    "we have shown the the speedster - exd can successfully take images in a mode that allows the system to read out only the pixels that contain charge above a set threshold , thus allowing it to achieve faster effective frame rates .",
    "the detector has been operated in both a full frame readout mode and a  sparse \" event driven readout mode , and its characteristics as an x - ray detector have been measured in each of these modes . the use of the ctia amplifier has also been shown to reduce ipc to the point at which its impact is unmeasurable .",
