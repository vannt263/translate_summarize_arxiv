    "therefore , if the target is placed sufficiently far from the backbone ( i.e. at least at half the height of a thoot ) the reaction turns out to be slow .",
    "once again the fraction of vertices giving rise to slow and fast reactions is the same . the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagramma close ] .",
    "in this work we found an useful formula , ( [ eq : h ramificato ] ) , to calculate the exact value of the hitting time , that is an alternative form of tetali s equation .",
    "this formula is particularly useful when the graph has ramifications .",
    "in particular we have calculated explicitly the value of @xmath0 for the bidimensional combs and its leading value for the @xmath121dimensional ones .",
    "we then used these results to calculate the mfpt@xmath168 and the gmfp for @xmath123-dimensional combs , observing that the leading value is composed by two terms , one proportional to @xmath287 , and the other one to @xmath288 , being @xmath91 the ratio between the size of the backbone and of the teeth .",
    "as for the gmfpt we noticed that its asymptotic behaviour does not directly depends on its fractal and spectral dimension ( as for homogeneous lattices and fractals ) and we calculated it exactly .",
    "finally we discussed our results in the context of reaction - kinetics .",
    "infact the mfpt can be seen as the mean time taken by a mobile reactant a to reach a static reactant b , when the starting point of the mobile reactant is not known .",
    "interestingly the typical time for the reaction to occur can be either larger ( slow reaction ) or smaller ( fast reaction ) than the gmfpt , and we outlined the set of trap locations for which these regimes are recovered .",
