    "at this conference , a large amount of new experimental data on exclusive decay modes of heavy hadrons have been presented . in order to interprete these measurements in the framework of the standard model",
    ", one has to be able to calculate hadronic matrix elements of products of quark / gluon operators .",
    "since these matrix elements involve long - distance quark - gluon dynamics , nonperturbative methods are needed . in this talk",
    ", we report on recent progress in applying qcd sum rule @xcite methods to solve this problem .",
    "the basic tools are the operator product expansion ( ope ) near the light - cone and dispersion relations in combination with quark - hadron duality .",
    "the basic nonperturbative input are the light - cone wave functions of light mesons .",
    "the wave functions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons are known @xcite with sufficient accuracy to allow for reliable predictions of heavy - to - light form factors and couplings .",
    "recently , one has also begun to study applications requiring @xmath20meson @xcite and photon @xcite wave functions .",
    "after a brief outline of the calculational procedure ( section 2 ) , results are presented for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 form factors ( section 3 ) , and the hadronic @xmath23 and @xmath24 couplings ( section 4 ) . from",
    "that we predict the widths of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is used to extract the value of @xmath7 from the cleo measurement of @xmath26 ( section 5 ) .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the flexibility of light - cone sum rules by summarizing results on the radiative decays @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "for definiteness , let us focus on the transition matrix element @xmath27 between a heavy ( @xmath28 ) and a light ( @xmath29 ) meson .",
    "the basic object to be calculated is the correlation function f_ab(q , p ) = d^4x e^ipx l(q ) t\\{|q(x)_a q(x ) , |q(0)_b q(0 ) } 0  .",
    "[ corr ] here , @xmath29 is taken on - shell with momentum q and the quark current @xmath30 with the external momentum @xmath31 is chosen to carry the quantum numbers of @xmath28 .",
    "the appropriate combinations of dirac matrices are denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "in contrast to conventional sum rules @xcite employing the wilson ope in terms of local operators , here the @xmath33-product of currents in ( [ corr ] ) is expanded in terms of nonlocal operators near the light - cone , i.e. at @xmath34 .",
    "schematically , this expansion has the form : l(q ) t\\{|q(x)_a q(x ) , |q(0)_b q(0 ) } 0 ~_i c_i(x ) l(q ) o_i(x,0 ) 0 [ matrix ] with calculable coefficients @xmath35 .",
    "the bilocal operators @xmath36 are constructed out of quark and gluon fields .    furthermore , the matrix elements of @xmath36 appearing in ( [ matrix ] ) are parametrized in terms of so - called light - cone wave functions @xmath37 characterized by particle multiplicity and twist . for the leading two - quark operator @xmath38 one has , schematically , l(q ) o_2a(x,0 ) 0 = _ n _ 0 ^ 1 du e^iuqx _ 2a^n(u)(x^2)^n  , [ wf ] where a path - ordered gauge factor has beed omitted for brevity . in the momentum region @xmath39 ,",
    "the light - cone expansion is dominated by the lowest - twist wave functions , and can therefore be truncated after a few terms .",
    "thereby , one may keep the momentum transfer @xmath40 timelike , in the range @xmath41gev@xmath42 .",
    "this is very important since it allows to calculate form factors in a wide kinematical region without the need of extrapolations .",
    "the connection of the correlation function @xmath43 with the matrix element @xmath44 of interest is obtained by writing a dispersion relation in the variable @xmath45 for @xmath43 and inserting the complete set of intermediate states @xmath46 with the quantum numbers of @xmath28 : f_ab=_i  .",
    "[ hadr ] obviously , the desired matrix element is contained in the contribution from @xmath47 . in order to determine it",
    ", one has to subtract the contributions of all other states @xmath48 . for the ground state @xmath28 in a given channel ,",
    "this is indeed possible to a reasonable approximation . to this end",
    ", one invokes quark - hadron duality to estimate the contribution of the heavier states in ( [ hadr ] ) , and applies the borel transformation in order to exponentially damp their contribution , and to diminish the sensitivity of the resulting expression for @xmath49 to the duality approximation .",
    "one of the principal advantages of the qcd sum rule method is the universality of the nonperturbative input parameters , in the light - cone variant the nonasymptotic coefficients of the light - cone wave functions .",
    "once these parameters have been determined from one set of measurements , one can apply the method to other observables without having to introduce new unknown parameters .",
    "furthermore , the matrix element @xmath50 , multiplying the @xmath51 transition element in ( [ hadr ] ) , and also the threshold parameter @xmath52 , separating in @xmath45 the ground state at @xmath53 from the region @xmath54 included in the duality integral , can be estimated separately from appropriate two - point sum rules .",
    "another principal advantage is the possibility to estimate the accuracy of a given result within the same sum - rule framework .",
    "an analogous estimate is not possible , for example , in phenomenological quark models .",
    "currently , one main source of uncertainties are perturbative corrections that are not yet known for sum rules of form factors and hadronic couplings .",
    "this problem will certainly be solved in near future .",
    "more difficult is it to improve our knowledge of the nonasymptotic terms in the light - cone wave functions .",
    "the lack of complete understanding leads to about 15 - 20% uncertainty in the predictions presented below .",
    "last but not least , qcd sum rules automatically include effects due to the finiteness of the physical quark masses and can deal with heavy and light quarks .",
    "moreover , they are not or at least less restricted to particular kinematical conditions such as zero recoil in form factors . in this respect , the sum rule method is not challenged by hqet ( heavy quark effective theory ) and complements lattice calculations .",
    "as a first example , we consider the matrix element of the @xmath21 transition which is parametrized by two form factors : ( q)|u_bb(p+q)=2f^+(p^2 ) q_+(f^+(p^2)+f^-(p^2 ) ) p _  . [ matr ] in @xcite ,",
    "the light - cone sum rule was obtained for the form factor @xmath2 in the region of momentum transfer @xmath56 gev@xmath42 , and to twist 4 accuracy . recently",
    "@xcite , the calculation of ( [ matr ] ) has been completed by deriving the sum rule for @xmath57 to the same accuracy . with these results at hand",
    ", we can also predict the scalar form factor f_0(p^2 ) = f^+(p^2 ) + f^-(p^2 )  .",
    "[ f0 ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we show our results @xcite for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in order to estimate the form factor @xmath2 at larger @xmath40",
    ", one may use the single pole approximation involving the @xmath58 resonance .",
    "the residue of the pole is proportional to the @xmath23 coupling which can be extracted from the same correlation function ( [ corr ] ) used also for @xmath2 ( see also section 4 ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the pole approximation normalized in this way nicely matches the result of the direct calculation at intermediate values of @xmath40 . also interesting to note",
    "is the consistency of our result on @xmath3 with the callan - treiman relation @xmath59 @xcite although this constraint is weak because of the sizeable uncertainty in the @xmath0 decay constant .",
    "the corresponding @xmath22 form factor @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . interestingly , in this case there is almost no difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned before , the correlation function ( [ corr ] ) can also be used to calculate the @xmath23 and @xmath24 couplings @xcite .",
    "the former is defined by b^*0(p)^+(q)b^+(p+q)= -g_b^*bq_^. [ g ] in this application , one has to employ dispersion relations and sum rule methods simultaneously in the @xmath0- and @xmath58- channels . after double borel transformation one obtains an expression for @xmath61 the leading twist term of which depends on the pion wave functions at the momentum fraction @xmath62 .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath63 , and by an analogous calculation for d mesons , @xmath64 .",
    "since these predictions depend on light - cone wave functions at a fixed point , they are less certain than the results on form factors which involve integrals over wave functions .    with the above value of @xmath65 one",
    "obtains the hadronic width @xmath66 .",
    "this estimate is perfectly consistent with the upper limit derived from recent measurements @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the results on @xmath67 and @xmath3 shown in fig . 1 , one can compute the widths for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we find ( b^0 ^ - e^+ _ e ) = 8.7  |v_ub|^2  ^-1  , [ bwidth ] ( b^0 ^ - ^+ _ ) = ( 0.7 0.8 ) ( b^0 ^ - e^+ _ e ) .",
    "[ bwidth1 ] unlike @xmath70 , the width of @xmath71 is very sensitive to the form factor @xmath3 .",
    "the interval given in ( [ bwidth1 ] ) reflects the uncertainty in the extrapolation of @xmath3 from the endpoint of the curve in fig . 1 to the value @xmath72 at @xmath73 implied by current algebra @xcite .    experimentally , combining the recent cleo result for @xmath74 @xcite , @xmath75  , with the world average of the @xmath76 lifetime @xcite , @xmath77 ps",
    ", one obtains @xmath78 where the errors have been added in quadrature .",
    "comparison with ( [ bwidth ] ) then yields @xmath79 the additional theoretical uncertainty is estimated to be less than 20% .",
    "recently , also the @xmath80 form factor has been calculated with the help of a light - cone sum rule @xcite .",
    "the resulting width @xmath81 together with ( [ bwidth ] ) yields a @xmath82 ratio in agreement with the cleo finding @xcite of about 1.4 .",
    "a further class of processes to which the method of light - cone sum rules can be applied fruitfully are exclusive radiative @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "recent examples include the calculations of the magnetic penguin form factor @xcite in @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and of the contribution from weak annihilation @xcite to @xmath85 . in the latter case",
    ", the light - cone expansion leads to matrix elements , respectively , hadronic wave functions associated with photon emission by a quark - antiquark pair at light - like separation . from these estimates",
    "weak annihilation is expected to contribute to @xmath86 at most @xmath87 of the penguin mediated short - distance amplitude .",
    "this effect is comparable in size to the theoretical uncertainty in the main amplitude .",
    "however , with increasing precision the long - distance effect due to weak annihilation may become non - negligible .",
    "in radiative @xmath1 decays , weak annihilation plays a more pronounced role since the short - distance penguin contributions are completely negligible .",
    "light - cone sum rules @xcite predict the branching ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the experimental observation of these modes is an interesting task for the next generation of charm experiments .    finally , by replacing the light hadronic currents in the above applications by a leptonic current",
    ", one can treat decays like @xmath90 in same framework .",
    "these modes are very interesting as the strong suppression for @xmath91 due to helicity conservation should be lifted by the photon emission .",
    "indeed , explicit calculation @xcite predicts a factor 10 enhancement : @xmath92 .    with the few examples selected for this review we hope to have illustrated the usefulness of qcd sum rules on the light - cone .",
