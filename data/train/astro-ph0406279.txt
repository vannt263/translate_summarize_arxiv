    "we are pursuing an extensive study of the thermal dust , molecular line , and radio continuum emission properties of luminous qsos from redshifts @xmath15 into the epoch of reionization ( eor ) at @xmath16 .",
    "one key aspect of these studies is to determine the star formation characteristics of the host galaxies .",
    "this question has become paramount since the discovery of the bulge mass  black hole mass correlation in nearby galaxies , a result which suggests a fundamental relationship between black hole and spheroidal galaxy formation ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferarrese & merrit 2000 ) .",
    "we have found that 30@xmath7 of optically selected qsos are hyper - luminous far - infrared ( fir ) galaxies , with @xmath17 l@xmath5 , corresponding to thermal emission from warm dust , and with dust masses @xmath18 m@xmath5 ( omont et al .",

    "2001a ; bertoldi et al .",
    "2003a ; priddey et al .",
    "radio continuum studies show that most of these sources follow the radio - to - fir correlation for star forming galaxies ( carilli et al .",
    "if the dust is heated by star formation , the implied ( massive ) star formation rates are of order @xmath19 m@xmath5 year@xmath6 , enabling the formation of the stellar content of a large spheroidal galaxy in a dynamical timescale of order @xmath20 years , although a contribution to dust heating by the agn certainly can not be ruled out ( see andreani et al .",
    "demographic studies show that super - massive black holes acquire most of their mass during major accretion events marked by the qso phenomenon ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "molecular line ( co ) emission has been detected from 13 fir - luminous @xmath21 qsos to date ( see carilli et al .",
    "2004 for a review ) , including the highest redshift qso , j1148 + 5251 at @xmath0 ( walter et al . 2003",
    "; bertoldi et al .",
    "the implied molecular gas masses are @xmath22 to @xmath23 m@xmath5 . detecting large masses of dust and co in the highest redshift qsos",
    "indicates that heavy element and dust formation , presumably via star formation , is a fundamental aspect of the early evolution of qso host galaxies , right back to the eor , within 0.8 gyr of the big bang .",
    "indeed , these observations of the dust and gas content of the highest redshift qsos are currently the only direct probe of the host galaxies in these systems .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the super - solar quasar metallicities deduced from the optical emission line ratios ( fan et al .",

    "2003 ; maiolino et al .",
    "2003 ; pentericci et al .",

    "in this paper we present the most sensitive radio continuum observations to date of the two highest redshift fir - luminous qsos known , sdss j114816.65 + 525150.2 at @xmath0 and sdss j104845.05 + 463718.3 at @xmath1 ( hereafter j1148 + 5251 and j1048 + 4637 ) .",
    "both sources have been detected at 250 ghz ( 1.2 mm ) using the mambo detector at the iram 30 m telescope ( corresponding to a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath24 m ) , with flux densities of @xmath25 mjy and and @xmath26 mjy , respectively ( bertoldi et al . 2003a ) .",
    "sensitive , high resolution radio continuum observations , in combination with the ( sub)mm observations , potentially probe the star formation characteristics of the host galaxies ( carilli et al .",
    "the radio observations presented herein were designed to probe to levels expected for star forming galaxies , as set by the fir luminosities , as well as to perform wide - field imaging to study the clustering of radio sources along the line of sight to the qsos .",
    "clustering in the field is an important characteristic when considering the possibility of gravitational magnification of the qso .",
    "gravitational lensing is a key factor in the study of high-@xmath27 qso demographics , and in calculations of cosmic stromgren spheres ( see discussion ) .",
    "we assume a standard concordance cosmology with h@xmath28 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "observations of j1148 + 5251 and j1048 + 4637 were made with the vla at 1.4 ghz in the a and b configurations ( 30 km and 10 km maximum baselines , respectively ) .",
    "the observational parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "most of the observations were made in standard continuum mode , except for one a array observation of j1148 + 5251 that was done in spectral line mode in order to perform very wide field imaging .",
    "standard gain and phase calibration , and self - calibration , was applied , and the images were made using the wide - field imaging capabilities of the aips task imagr .",
    "the last two columns in table 1 give the measured flux density at the optical position of the qso for each observation ( note : in all these observations the sources are unresolved ) . for j1048 + 4637",
    "we get a ( weighted ) average value of @xmath29jy . for j1148 + 5251",
    "the value is @xmath30jy .",
    "hence j1148 + 5251 is reasonably detected at 4.6@xmath31 , while j1048 + 4637 is only marginally detected at 2.2@xmath31 .",
    "the b array images of the two sources are shown in figure 1 at 4.5@xmath32 resolution .",
    "figure 2 shows the wide field image of j1148 + 5251 , while figure 3 shows a blow - up of the inner part of the field , along with the sdss optical image ( the contour levels are different in the two images , in order to emphasize only the brighter sources in figure 2 ) .",
    "note the large number of bright radio sources in the j1148 + 5251 field , in particular five sources brighter than 22 mjy within 8@xmath9 of the qso .",
    "this is a factor 30 higher than the average source density for @xmath33mjy ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the brightest source within 8@xmath9 of j1048 + 4637 is 11 mjy , which is roughly as expected for a random field .",
    "four of the five bright sources are extended , double radio sources , and one is unresolved at 1.5@xmath32 resolution .",
    "the sdss reveals optical counterparts for all five sources ( york et al .",
    "2000 ; abazajian et al .",
    "two of the sources have spectroscopic redshifts , one corresponding to a bright qso at @xmath34 .",
    "the positions and magnitudes for the five sources brighter than 22 mjy within @xmath35 of j1148 + 5251 are given in table 2 , in order of decreasing radio flux density .",
    "we note that a similar over - density of radio sources has also been found in the field around the @xmath36 qso sdss j1030 + 0524 ( petric et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the most striking radio source is the bright fri ( fanaroff - riley class",
    "i = edge - darkened ) radio galaxy extending over 4@xmath9 , with the core located 1@xmath9 southwest of j1148 + 5251 ( source 4 in table 2 ) .",
    "this galaxy was also detected at 250 ghz with @xmath37 mjy using mambo ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003a ) , and has an sdss spectroscopic redshift of @xmath38 .",
    "the sdss photometry implies a bolometric magnitude for this galaxy of m@xmath39 , or a bolometric luminosity of @xmath40 l@xmath5 .",
    "there is also a companion galaxy in the sdss ( not radio loud ) at the same redshift , located 25@xmath32 northwest of the fri host .    on seeing the over - density of bright radio sources in the j1148 + 5251 field",
    ", we searched the sdss data for a galaxy cluster .",
    "no cluster of galaxies is seen within a degree of j1148 + 5251 out to @xmath41 , although a linear filament is detected in the galaxy distribution that extends from about 14,000 to 24,000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the radio - fir correlation for star forming galaxies is one of the tightest correlations in extragalactic astronomy , and has become a standard tool in the study of extragalactic star formation ( condon 1992 ) , eg . as a fundamental assumption in the radio photometric redshift technique , widely used for distant starburst galaxies ( carilli & yun 1999 ) , and as a radio - loud agn diagnostic ( reddy & yun 2004 ) . in this section",
    "we consider the two fir - luminous @xmath42 qsos in the context of the radio - fir correlation .",
    "the fir luminosities of the sources were derived from the 250 ghz flux densities by bertoldi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) assuming a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) typical of an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy , corresponding roughly to thermal emission from warm dust at 50  k with a dust emissivity index @xmath43 . for j1148 + 5251",
    "they find : @xmath44 l@xmath5 .",
    "the value for j1048 + 4637 is @xmath45 l@xmath5 .",
    "we derive the intrinsic luminosity density at 1.4 ghz from the observed flux density at 1.4 ghz assuming a spectral index of @xmath46 , characteristic of star forming galaxies . for j1148 + 5251",
    "we find : @xmath47 w hz@xmath6 , and for j1048 + 4637 : @xmath48 w hz@xmath6 .        where l@xmath51 is defined as the far infrared luminosity between 40 and 120 @xmath52 m . for j1148 + 5251",
    "we find : @xmath53 , and for j1048 + 4637 : @xmath54 , where the errors are derived assuming @xmath55 errors on each quantity .    in figure 4",
    "we plot the @xmath49 values versus 60@xmath52 m luminositym luminosity ( @xmath56 ) is 2/3 the fir luminosity . ] for j1148 + 5251 and j1048 + 4637 , and for the iras 2 jy sample of galaxies from yun et al .",
    "the solid line shows the mean of the relationship for the iras galaxies , @xmath57 , while the dashed lines show the range determined by yun et al . to correspond to star forming galaxies .",
    "objects below this range are radio - loud agn . both the high @xmath27 qsos fall within the range corresponding to star forming galaxies . if star formation is the dominant dust heating mechanism in these sources , the implied star formation rates are about 3000 m@xmath5 year@xmath6 and 2000 m@xmath5 year@xmath6 , respectively ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003b ) .    of course , we can not rule - out some contribution to dust heating by the agn .",
    "for instance , the sources could still fall in the range defined by star forming galaxies ( ie .",
    "@xmath58 ) and yet have @xmath59 to @xmath60 of their fir luminosity powered by agn dust heating . likewise",
    ", current constraints on the rest - frame ir seds can not preclude a warm ( @xmath61k ) dust component , presumably heated by the agn , that would dominate in the mid - ir , as has been seen in the cloverleaf qso at @xmath62 ( weiss et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the radio - fir correlation provides a consistency check for star formation in the host galaxies of these systems , although it should not be construed as proof thereof .",
    "coupled with the large molecular gas masses , the fuel for star formation , these observations argue for a massive starburst coeval with the accretion activity onto the supermassive black hole in these systems .",
    "high resolution imaging of the co emission is in progress which should help elucidate the characteristics of the host galaxy ( walter et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "strong gravitational lensing would magnify these sources , such that the inferred luminosities would be over - estimated .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity is one of the key parameters in the calculation of the radii of cosmic stromgren spheres around these sources , which can be used to constrain the timescale for qso activity , or alternatively , the neutral fraction of the igm ( haiman & cen 2002 ; white et al . 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2004 ) .",
    "lensing corrections are also fundamental to the derivation of qso demographics ( wyithe & loeb 2002 ; fan et al . 2003 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; richards et al . 2004 ) .",
    "although there is a clear over - density of bright radio sources in the j1148 + 5251 field , no galaxy cluster is seen in the sdss data out to @xmath12 .",
    "two of the radio sources have spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "if we assume that the radio sources without spectroscopic redshifts have host galaxies with luminosities similar to that of the @xmath11 source , then their faint optical magnitudes place them at @xmath65 to 1.5 .",
    "hence , it is possible that these three sources , plus the qso , form a large scale structure at @xmath66 .",
    "however , the angular separation of the sources implies a scale for such a structure @xmath67 mpc ( comoving ) , ie . not a dense cluster .",
    "we conclude that the over - density of bright radio sources in the j1148 + 5251 field is either a statistical fluke , or a very large scale structure possibly at @xmath68 . such filamentary structures on very large scale lack the mass surface density to produce strong gravitational magnification ( bacon et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we also consider lensing by the brightest galaxy closest to the line - of - sight to the qso at @xmath11 ( source 4 in table 2 ) . from the observed magnitude",
    "we calculate a velocity dispersion of 275 km s@xmath6 for this galaxy using the faber - jackson relation .",
    "the magnification of the qso 1@xmath9 distant from the galaxy is then negligible ( roughly @xmath69 ) .",
    "overall , the radio and sdss data provide no evidence for a dense cluster , or bright galaxy , along the line of sight to j1148 + 5251 which could act to magnify the qso . of course , these data can not rule - out a much more distant galaxy , or cluster , close to the line of sight lensing the qso .",
    "white et al . ( 2003 ) consider this question in detail , and in particular , they discuss evidence for a possible proto - cluster at @xmath70 , as suggested by ly @xmath71 emission and civ absorption in the qso spectrum .",
    "they conclude that such a distant cluster could magnify substantially the qso without violating the size constraint of @xmath72 set by ground - based near - ir imaging ( fan et al .",
    "hst imaging at @xmath73 is in progress which will test this interesting possibility ( white et al . in prep ) .",
    "we note that hst images of four other @xmath74 qsos by richards et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show no evidence for multiple imaging on scales of 0.1@xmath75 .",
