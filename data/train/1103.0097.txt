    "the total sequence space consists of all possible strings of length @xmath1 and thus has a size @xmath5 which increases exponentially with @xmath1 . for computational ease , it is useful to lump some of the information in a single letter .",
    "for example , instead of working with all the four nucleotides in a genotype , one can classify them as purines ( adenine and guanine ) and pyrimidines ( thymine and cytosine ) thus reducing @xmath2 to two .",
    "similarly instead of considering all possible mutations at a locus , one may differentiate between genotypes by the absence or presence of a mutation which again corresponds to @xmath6 @xcite . in this article",

    "it represents the replication rate of a genotype or the functionality of a protein .",
    "the sequence space along with the fitness of each sequence comprises the _ fitness landscape_. the choice of fitness landscape plays an important role in determining the course of evolution and can be made according to the biological situation that one wishes to model and the available experimental data or the analytical tractability of the problem .",
    "a fitness landscape can be simple in that the fitness of a sequence depends only on its distance from a given sequence .",
    "more often however the fitness landscapes are complex and one has to specify all the @xmath16 fitnesses .",
    "these fitnesses can be assumed to be independent random variables @xcite or they may have correlations @xcite . an important feature of generic fitness landscapes is the presence of epistasis which is a measure of the nonlinear contribution of locus fitness to the sequence @xcite .",
    "if each locus contributes independently to the sequence fitness , a fitness landscape is said to be non - epistatic .",
    "fitness can also depend on time as in the case of changing environment @xcite or it can be a function of the concentration of the genotype frequency . in this review , we will employ various types of fitness landscapes .    _",
    "mutation : _ stochastic changes known as mutations may happen in the genome of an individual .",
    "these may insert , delete or change the nucleotides in the genome and thus create a new sequence with a different fitness .",

    "however one can still define an error threshold in the large time limit analogous to that on static fitness landscapes as the maximum mutation rate above which the population gets uniformly distributed over the sequence space . a possible way to determine",

    "the bilinear frequency combination @xmath173 is called _ linkage disequilibrium _ @xmath174 at time @xmath33 and is a measure of the correlation between the frequency at the two loci . using ( [ basicrec1])-([basicrec4 ] )",
    "we have @xmath175 so that the linkage disequilibrium vanishes in the steady state _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath176 and as a consequence , the frequency of the sequence @xmath177 equals the product of frequency of sequences @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "for example , the frequency of zero sequence at first locus equals @xmath180 and that at the second locus is @xmath181 . using @xmath182",
    ", it follows that the product @xmath183 , the frequency of the sequence @xmath155 .",
    "although the linkage disequilibrium is zero when only recombination is present , it is usually nonzero when selection and/or mutation are also included .",
    "we now discuss the situation when selection , mutation and recombination are present .",
    "we will consider the fitness scheme in which two fitness peaks are separated by a fitness valley and assume that @xmath184 . in a population",
    "initially localised at @xmath155 , a mutation in @xmath155 to @xmath159 or @xmath158 is deleterious but the fitness loss can be compensated by acquiring another mutation resulting in the sequence @xmath156 . in the absence of recombination and for small mutation rates , the population will eventually localise around the fittest @xmath156 sequence ( see sec  [ hap ] ) .",
    "however due to nonlinear evolution equations , multiple steady states may result @xcite . as discussed below",
    ", there exists a critical recombination rate @xmath185 below which the population can cross the intervening valley and reach the fittest peak at @xmath156 . but",
    "above @xmath185 , the population can remain trapped at the initial sequence with low fitness and thus the sexual reproduction can affect the adaptation process adversely .",
    "we now describe the population behavior for two schemes of mutation rates . _",
    "multiple equilibria in steady state : _ if the mutation matrix is symmetric and given by ( [ mutprob1 ] ) , the evolution equations can be written as @xcite x_0(t+1)&= & x_0(t)- r ( 1 - 2 ) ^2 [ multrec1 ] + x_1(t+1 ) & = & x_1(t)+ r ( 1 - 2 ) ^2 + x_2(t+1 ) & = & x_2(t)+r ( 1 - 2 ) ^2 + x_3(t+1 ) & = & x_3(t)- r ( 1 - 2 ) ^2 [ multrec4 ] where @xmath186 is the average fitness of the population , the linkage disequilibrium @xmath187 and the primed fractions are given by the left hand side of ( [ exdis ] ) : x_i(t)= to arrive at the set of equations ( [ multrec1])- ( [ multrec4 ] ) , it has been assumed that recombination occurs after selection and mutation .",
    "thus in the set of equations ( [ basicrec1])-([basicrec4 ] ) , the frequency on the right hand side refers to @xmath188 upon using which ( [ multrec1])- ( [ multrec4 ] ) are obtained .    in the steady state , for the fitness landscape described above , the fractions @xmath189 s can be expressed in terms of the fitness @xmath190 s and the average fitness @xmath150 .",
    "on using the resulting expressions for @xmath189 s in the equation for @xmath150 , a quartic equation for @xmath150 is obtained .",
    "an analysis @xcite of this equation shows that for @xmath191 , the fittest sequence is always populated while for @xmath192 , there are two stable solutions : either the population stays at the initial sequence @xmath193 or moves to the fittest sequence @xmath156 .",
    "_ time to fixation : _ if the mutations are unidirectional with the probability to mutate from @xmath171 to @xmath14 being @xmath27 and zero for the back mutation , the whole population occupies the fittest sequence and the sequence @xmath156 is said to be fixed .",
    "in such a case , it is interesting to study the dynamics of the population and more specifically , one can find the time @xmath194 to fixation .    for the one - way mutation scheme in which first selection takes place followed by recombination and finally mutation",
    ", the time evolution occurs according to the following nonlinear equations @xcite : x_0(t+1)&= & + x_1(t+1 ) & = & + x_2(t+1 ) & = & + x_3(t+1 ) & = & + & - & here @xmath195 is the linkage disequilibrium at time @xmath33 and @xmath186 is the average fitness of the population .",
    "the above equations can be written down in a manner analogous to the above cases . since selection occurs before recombination , on replacing @xmath165 by @xmath196 on the rhs of ( [ basicrec1])-([basicrec4 ] )",
    ", the evolution equations with selection and recombination are obtained .",
    "finally the unidirectional mutation scheme is implemented .",
    "the equations for the corresponding unnormalised populations @xmath197 s defined by ( [ eigendisc ] ) can also be written .",
    "but due to the recombination term , the equations for @xmath197 s also remain nonlinear .",
    "an approximate method to handle these dynamical nonlinear equations can be developed by noting that at any instant , for small mutation rates , only one of the four populations dominate",
    ". then the dynamics of population @xmath197 s can be divided in following three dynamical phases @xcite : ( i ) @xmath198 ( phase i ) ( ii ) @xmath199 ( phase ii ) and ( iii ) @xmath200 ( phase iii ) .",
    "thus one can expand the equations for unnormalised populations in powers of @xmath201 in phase i , @xmath202 in phase ii and similarly , @xmath203 in phase iii .",
    "the time at which a phase ends is obtained by matching the solutions of the relevant populations in the two phases . the fixation time",
    "is then obtained by summing over these phase times .    as mentioned above",
    ", there exists a critical recombination fraction @xmath185 beyond which a population initially located at @xmath155 can not cross the intermediate fitness valley and reach the double mutant fitness peak @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ comptime ] shows that the fixation time diverges as @xmath169 approaches critical recombination probability @xmath204 .    a simple calculation using the method described above but ignoring the nonlinearities shows that the fixation time diverges as @xmath205 .",
    "however a more careful analysis that takes the nonlinear terms into account shows that the fixation time is well approximated by @xcite t [ tau1comp2 ] where the constant @xmath206 .",
    "thus the fixation time decays slower than @xmath205 due to the logarithmic corrections ( see fig .",
    "[ comptime ] ) .",
    "the population frequencies and fixation time can be analysed for other fitness schemes as well and a discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "although we have discussed the haploid case , the diploid problem has also been studied @xcite . for studies on models that consider more than two loci",
    ", the reader may refer to @xcite .",
    "in this review , we have presented a brief ( and incomplete ) overview of evolutionary processes and models in deterministically evolving populations .",
    "as we have discussed , these systems are inherently nonlinear and difficult to analyse analytically .",
    "the nonlinearity of these systems that makes them so difficult to handle , is also responsible for the complex behaviour of their solutions .",
    "the existence of multiple steady states and dynamic phase transitions are some of the interesting features displayed by these models .",
    "while these theoretical models of evolutionary biology have garnered interest amongst physicists and mathematicians , they have also been successful in predicting biological properties and explaining the experimental results quantitatively .",
