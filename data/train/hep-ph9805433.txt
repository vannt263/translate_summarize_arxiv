    "the restoration of the chiral symmetry is important also in physics of neutron stars and early universe .",
    "effective theories of qcd such as @xmath4 model@xcite and nambu - jona - lasinio@xcite model or lattice qcd@xcite have been used in the study of the chiral phase transition and the related critical phenomena in qcd . an effective potential and/or schwinger - dyson equation for quark propagator",
    "have been widely used to study the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finite temperature and/or finite chemical potential .    in this paper",
    "we study the chiral phase transition at finite temperature in the chiral limit .",
    "we use the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis(cjt ) type effective potential@xcite for a composite operator in the framework of the renormalization group improved gauge theory(the so called qcd - like gauge theory)[5,6,7 ] .",
    "we take into account a correct asymptotic behavior of the quark self energy and use the variational method in calculating the effective potential .",
    "the present approach does not break the chiral symmetry explicitly in contrast to some previous studies of the effective theories of qcd . using the effective potential we study the critical temperature and order of the chiral phase transition .",
    "if the transition is second order , we can calculate the critical exponents .",
    "rajagopal and wilczek have studied the second order phase transition using three dimensional @xmath5 heisenberg model@xcite .",
    "however it is still an open question whether qcd with two massless quarks and @xmath5 heisenberg model belong to the same universality class or not .",
    "the critical exponents have been also studied using lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in previous studies of the effective theories which respect the qcd[9,10,11,12 ] it is not obvious whether the critical exponents agree with those of the mean field approximation a la landau or not .",
    "we numerically study the critical exponents of the order parameter for the chiral phase transition @xmath6 , the pion decay constant at finite temperature @xmath7 and @xmath3 which is the coefficient of the quadratic term in the effective potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we briefly review the effective potential for a composite operator in the qcd - like gauge theory . in sec.3",
    "we calculate the effective potential at finite temperature . in sec.4",
    "we present numerical results and determine the temperature dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "we also estimate the critical exponents .",
    "sec.5 contains the summary and discussion .",

    "the cjt effective potential for the quark propagator takes the following form in minkowski space : @xmath10&=&\\int\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\pi)^4i}~\\mbox{tr}\\left(\\ln ( s^{-1}(p)g(p))-s^{-1}(p)g(p)+1\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{i}{2}\\int\\int\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\pi)^4i}~\\frac{d^4q}{(2\\pi)^4i}~g^2c_2\\mbox{tr}\\left(\\gamma_{\\mu}g(p)\\gamma_{\\nu}g(q)\\right)d^{\\mu\\nu}(p - q),\\label{eqn : vg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the quadratic casimir operator for color @xmath12 group , @xmath13 is the propagator of a massless quark , and @xmath14 is the gluon propagator in the landau gauge : @xmath15 which is diagonal in the color space and `` tr '' refers to dirac , flavor and color matrices .",
    "an alternative effective potential for composite operator which is a variation of eq.([eqn : vg ] ) was developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we use the one presented above .    in the landau gauge and the one - loop approximation , we can expand the quark two - point function as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the scalar part and the pseudo - scalar part of the quark dynamical mass function , respectively . substituting ( [ eqn : sp ] ) into ( [ eqn : vg ] ) and using the running coupling in the two - loop level potential",
    "we obtain the following effective potential @xmath19 which satisfies the renormalization group equation after wick rotation , @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of the light flavors .",
    "this expression is our starting point .",
    "the order parameter can be determined by the condition @xmath23 these extremum conditions for @xmath24 with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath26 are equivalent to the schwinger - dyson equations for the quark propagator in the improved ladder approximation .",
    "we take @xmath27 without loss of generality because of the chiral symmetry .",
    "we use higashijima - miransky approximation[5,6 ] for the running coupling with an infrared modification@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 here , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the number of flavors which controls the running coupling , and @xmath32 is a parameter to regularize the divergence at @xmath33 .",
    "the modified running coupling has the same asymptotic behavior as the qcd running coupling , while it gradually approaches a constant as @xmath34 decreases .",
    "the value of the running coupling at @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the infrared regularization parameter .",
    "as @xmath38 has no angle dependence in four - dimensional euclidean space , eqs.([eqn : vz1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : vz2 ] ) are reduced to @xmath39 & = & 4n_fn_c\\int\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\pi)^4}~\\frac{\\sigma_s^2(p^2)}{\\sigma_s^2(p^2)+p^2}\\nonumber\\\\&&-2n_fn_c\\int\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\pi)^4}~\\ln\\frac{\\sigma_s^2(p^2)+p^2}{p^2},\\label{eqn : v1}\\\\ v_2[\\sigma_s ] & = & -12n_fn_cc_2\\int\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\pi)^4}~\\frac{{\\bar e}^2(p^2)}{p^2}~\\frac{\\sigma_s(p^2)}{\\sigma_s^2(p^2)+p^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\int_{p^2>q^2}\\frac{d^4q}{(2\\pi)^4}~\\frac{\\sigma_s(q^2)}{\\sigma_s^2(q^2)+q^2}.\\label{eqn : v2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this paper we consider the case where the chiral symmetry is exact , i.e. renormalized current quark masses are zero .",
    "we use the variational method to investigate the vacuum of the qcd - like theory and use the following form for @xmath17 as a trial mass function@xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the renormalization group invariant vacuum expectation value of @xmath42 .",
    "this form was chosen so that its asymptotic form @xmath43 coincides with the one obtained by using the operator product expansion and the renormalization group equation@xcite .",
    "this form of dynamical mass function does not break the chiral symmetry explicitly , i.e. the axial vector current is conserved .",
    "we apply the imaginary time formalism@xcite to calculate the effective potential at finite temperature .",
    "since fermion fields obey an anti - periodic boundary condition , we have @xmath44 and the four - momentum integration is replaced with the summation over the matsubara - frequency @xmath45 and the three - momentum integration @xmath46 in eqs.([eqn : v1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : v2 ] ) .",
    "now we have @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 denotes the summation over @xmath52 and integration over @xmath53 with the condition @xmath54 and we have replaced @xmath55 and @xmath25 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "their functional forms are given below .",
    "let us now consider the choice for the running coupling and the quark dynamical mass function at finite temperature .",
    "we expect that the running coupling decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "usually a coupling of the form like @xmath58 is used .",
    "however we use a running form @xmath59 as a natural extension of the @xmath60 case(eq.([eqn : coup ] ) ) .    as concerns the dynamical mass function , we use the following function @xmath61 by replacing @xmath34 with @xmath62 also in eq.([eqn : s2 ] ) . here , @xmath1 is the variational parameter of the effective potential and its value is determined from the minimum of the potential .",
    "note that the chiral symmetry is not explicitly broken by the choice eq.([eqn : fq ] ) .    using the effective potential in eqs.([eqn : v11 ] ) and ( [ eqn : v12 ] ) with the ansatz eq.([eqn : fe ] ) , eq.([eqn : fq ] ) and changing the variables @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the rescaled order parameter .",
    "the sum over @xmath52 , @xmath68 , is taken to an extent that @xmath69 .    in order to determine the critical temperature @xmath70 , we expand the effective potential as a power series of the order parameter with finite coefficients @xmath71 @xmath72 the coefficient @xmath3",
    "is calculated as follows @xmath73.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the critical temperature @xmath70 is determined by the condition , @xmath74 .",
    "in our calculation we put @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we use the three flavor(@xmath77 ) running coupling since three flavors(u , d , s ) contribute to the running coupling in the energy region of the chiral phase transition .",
    "since it has been shown that the quantities such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not sensitive to the infrared regularization parameter @xmath78 at zero temperature@xcite , we expect that these quantities are insensitive to @xmath78 also at finite temperature as long as @xmath78 is not too large .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the @xmath78 dependence of the value of @xmath1 , the location of minimum , the pion decay constant @xmath8 which is approximately given by the pagels - stoker formula@xcite : @xmath79 and the constituent quark mass @xmath52 defined by the relation , @xmath80 .",
    "the fact that these values are insensitive to the infrared cutoff at zero temperature has been also pointed out by kugo _",
    "et al_@xcite who used the schwinger - dyson equation in the improved ladder approximation .",
    "therefore we fix the infrared regularization parameter @xmath78 to @xmath81 . in fig.2",
    "we show that at zero temperature the approximate form of the dynamical mass function @xmath17 at the minimum of @xmath24 well reproduces the exact solution of the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "therefore we adopt eq.([eqn : fq ] ) as a trial function and use @xmath4 as a variational parameter at finite temperature .",
    "we have confirmed that the quantities such as @xmath82 and @xmath83 are insensitive to the infrared regularization parameter @xmath78 at finite temperature .",
    "the effective potential at finite temperature is shown in fig.3 . at zero temperature",
    "the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken . as temperature grows the minimum of the potential continuously approaches zero .",
    "hence we have second order phase transition at @xmath84 . to determine the value of @xmath85 we use the pagels - stoker formula and",
    "fix the pion decay constant @xmath8 to @xmath86 mev at zero temperature and have @xmath87mev .",
    "then the restoration of the chiral symmetry occurs at @xmath0mev .",
    "the temperature dependence of the order parameter @xmath6 is shown in fig.4 .",
    "as concerns the temperature dependence of @xmath6 we refer , for example , to that of the free pion gas approximation : @xmath88 this behavior is also shown in fig.4 and there is a slight difference between our result and eq.([eqn : cpt ] ) in the low temperature region .",
    "once the quark dynamical mass function is determined from the minimum of the effective potential , we can calculate the pion decay constant @xmath8 at finite temperature using the pagels - stoker formula extended to finite temperature : @xmath89 where @xmath49 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath7 is shown in fig.5 .",
    "since we have a second order phase transition , we can estimate the critical exponents . to estimate the critical exponents we define the reduced temperature @xmath90 and exponents",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 as follows : @xmath94    in the spin system the exponent @xmath92 is defined for the magnetic susceptibility @xmath95 . in case of the chiral phase transition , @xmath95 is defined as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the current quark mass .",
    "our exponent @xmath92 agrees with that of the magnetic susceptibility , if the effect of the finite current mass near @xmath70 is represented as @xmath98 and , furthermore , if @xmath99 does not have a singular behavior .    in landau theory of second order phase transition , the assumption that @xmath100 leads to @xmath101 .",
    "in ref.@xcite they study the critical exponents within the landau theory . in general @xmath92",
    "deviates from 1 .",
    "so we first examine the critical exponent @xmath92 for three cases of the infrared regularization parameter @xmath102 .",
    "we determine the exponent @xmath92 from a slope of the linear log fit @xmath103 where @xmath104 is independent of @xmath90 . in order to extract the exponent we use the @xmath105 fitting(see fig.6 ) and have @xmath106 these results are consistent with the landau theory .    in the same way(see fig.7 ) we determine the exponents @xmath91 for @xmath107 and have @xmath108 which is appreciably different from the landau theory .",
    "next , let us estimate @xmath93 .",
    "we used the pagels - stoker formula and eq.([eqn : fq ] ) for calculating @xmath7 , thus we have @xmath109 we have checked numerically that @xmath110 is free from the singular behavior in the limit @xmath111 .",
    "it follows that the behavior of @xmath7 near @xmath70 is the same as that of the condensate : @xmath112 thus we have @xmath113 .",
    "the same analysis can be repeated for the exponent of the mass gap @xmath114 . as far as we use eq.([eqn : fq ] ) as a trial mass function , the exponent of the mass gap agrees with the exponent @xmath91 .    note that we use eq.([eqn : exp ] ) to evaluate the critical exponents . as a rule , for @xmath115 ( @xmath116 dimension of space - time )",
    "one obtains the universal prediction of the mean field theory .",
    "however , for @xmath117 the infrared divergences which appears in the coefficients of the power series expansion invalidate the predictions of the mean field theory@xcite . here",
    "we are interested in the case of @xmath118 , which is critical .",
    "although our results are well fitted by eq.([eqn : exp ] ) , there may be logarithmic corrections to the power behavior assumed in eq.([eqn : exp ] ) .",
    "in summary , we studied the chiral phase transition at finite temperature in the qcd - like gauge theory .",
    "we made use of the cjt effective potential in the improved ladder approximation and took account of the logarithmic behavior in the quark dynamical mass function .",
    "in qcd - like gauge theory it has been pointed out that at zero temperature the physical quantities such as @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath52 are quite stable under a change of the infrared cutoff .",
    "we confirmed that the temperature dependence of these quantities are also stable under a change of @xmath78(see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "then we put @xmath107 and investigated the temperature dependence of the effective potential and found the second order phase transition at @xmath119 .",
    "we fixed the value of the pion decay constant @xmath2 to 93mev at zero temperature and had @xmath87mev , therefore we obtained @xmath0mev .",
    "we also examined the temperature dependence of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    as we have the second order phase transition , we calculated the critical exponents @xmath92 and @xmath91 which are the exponents of the quadratic term of the effective potential and the order parameter , respectively .",
    "we examined @xmath92 for three cases of the infrared regularization parameter and found @xmath120 .",
    "this result is consistent with the landau theory .",
    "however we found that @xmath121 appreciably deviates from the value of the landau theory @xmath122 .",
    "our approach is somewhat related to the mean field approximation .",
    "however we have introduced the logarithmic behavior in the quark dynamical mass function .",
    "this may be one of the main reasons that @xmath91 deviates from the landau theory .",
    "our results are different from @xmath5 heisenberg model .",
    "we also calculated the exponents of @xmath7 and @xmath114 and they coincided with @xmath91 .    in calculating the temperature dependence of several quantities related to the chiral phase transition and estimating the critical exponents , the effective potential and/or the schwinger - dyson equation with a variety of approximation have been used[9,10,11,12 ] . in ref.@xcite they have used a variety of cjt effective potential , which is modified by using schwinger - dyson equation in eq.([eqn : vg ] ) , and the trial mass function without logarithmic behavior . however they have discussed the critical phenomena within a landau theory . in ref.@xcite",
    "they have used the coulomb gauge schwinger - dyson equation with an instantaneous approximation and have found @xmath123 . in recent work based on the confining schwinger - dyson equation@xcite , it has been found that @xmath124 . on the other hand , in ref.@xcite",
    "they have used the schwinger - dyson equation in the improved ladder approximation and have found that @xmath125 . although their model is in the same framework as ours , however , this value largely deviates from the landau theory and our result .",
    "we calculate the effective potential by using the trial mass function , while the authors of ref.@xcite solved the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "furthermore , there are important differences in the handling of the gluon propagator at finite temperature and in the choice of the argument of the running coupling , they used @xmath126 .    in this paper , we have obtained a large value of @xmath85 .",
    "this may be partly due to the fact that we did not consider the effect of the color confinement .",
    "in fact , in ref.@xcite , they have used an observed value of @xmath85 to reproduce the pion decay constant .",
    "as mentioned in sec.iv , some critical exponents are defined in relation to the current quark mass .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to generalize our model to the case of a finite current mass and to study the critical exponents and the scaling relations .",
