    "<S> however in order to reach room temperature such values of the coupling constant are necessary which are not possible in real materials . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we can increase the frequency @xmath6 due nonphonon pairing mechanisms as proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however with increasing of the frequency the coupling constant decreases as @xmath11 , therefore @xmath12 . the second critical magnetic field can be enlarge due to the decrease of the correlation length in `` dirty limit '' @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is a free length . </S>",
    "<S> however the critical field is low near the critical temperature : @xmath15 . in a present work </S>",
    "<S> we generalize bcs model so that the problem of the critical parameters is removed due to the fact that a ratio between the gap and the critical temperature ( @xmath16 for presently known materials ) is changed to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a system of fermions with hamiltonian : @xmath18      \\equiv \\widehat{h}_{\\texttt{bcs}}+\\widehat{h}_{\\texttt{\\texttt{ext}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is bcs hamiltonian - kinetic energy + pairing interaction ( @xmath20 ) , energy @xmath21 is counted from fermy surface . </S>",

    "<S> correlation length @xmath92 , magnetic field penetration depth @xmath5 and ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath93 are @xmath94 the proportionality of the penetration depth to the temperature and the inverse proportionality to the external pair potential - eq.([3.11 ] ) is the expected result . </S>",
    "<S> greater attention should be given to a reduction of the correlation length with temperature - eq.([3.10 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can see @xmath92 is determined by properties of a superconductor only ( at @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we know that the correlation length depends on temperature as @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> that is at @xmath71 it increases with increasing temperature , at @xmath96 it diverges , at @xmath72 it decreases with increasing temperature as @xmath97 ( at large @xmath98 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however above the critical temperature the correlation length has physical sense of the size of a superconducting phase nucleus in a normal conductor . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting phase at @xmath72 is energetically unfavorable and because it arises fluctuationally by bubble size @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> switching of the field @xmath35 changes the situation . </S>",
    "<S> the field holds fluctuationally arisen superconducting phase nucleuses . </S>",
    "<S> this continues until the superconducting phase does not fill the entire volume of the metal . from eq.([3.12 ] ) we can see the ginzburg - landau parameter increases with temperature as @xmath99 unlike usual superconductors where the parameter is constant . </S>",
    "<S> this means that at large temperature all superconductors in the external pair field become type ii superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the critical temperature important characteristics of a superconductor are the first @xmath100 and the second @xmath2 critical fields . </S>",
    "<S> the first critical field is half as much than a field of single vortex which can be determined from eq.([3.7b ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have @xmath101 hence critical current of emergence of resistance is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is radius of a wire @xcite . for calculation of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> we can use the method presented in appendix [ field ] . </S>",
    "<S> then eq.([3.7b ] ) has a form @xmath104\\varphi+\\varphi|\\varphi|-\\varphi=0\\ ] ] we can consider the order parameter is real @xmath105 and average it over the system so that @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> then we have @xmath107 and the order parameter is @xmath108 we can see @xmath88 decreases with increasing magnetic field , however the second critical field is infinity like the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> superconductor phase exists at any magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a phase transition to the normal state with increasing magnetic field can be explained as follows . in ginzburg - landau theory transition to normal </S>",
    "<S> state takes place when average distance between vortexes becomes the order of the correlation length @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> a line in center of a vortex is normal . </S>",
    "<S> if distance between the centers of vortexes is @xmath92 hence the system is divided into the superconducting regions size of @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> however the correlation length is size of a normal phase nucleus arising fluctuationally in the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> thus the fluctuations destroy superconducting phase if distance between centers of vortexes is less than @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above switching of the field @xmath35 changes the situation . the external pair potential holds superconducting phase regions the size of @xmath92 eq.([3.10 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the superconducting phase is stable at any concentration of the vortexes hence at any magnetic field intensity .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the proposed model of hypothetical superconductivity demonstrates the principal differences from results of bcs and ginzburg - landau theory due presence of the external pair potential . in a case of decreasing of cooper pair s energy by the external field </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap tends to zero asymptotically with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ratio between the gap and the critical temperature is @xmath109 instead of a finite value in bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the energy gap tends to zero asymptotically with increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> thus critical temperature and the second critical magnetic field are equal to infinity formally . unlike bcs model </S>",
    "<S> the ginzburg - landau parameter is not constant and it increases with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this means that at large temperature all superconductors in the external pair field become type ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however the first critical magnetic field and maximal current of a thin wire are finite values and decrease with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this model does not solve the problem of room - temperature superconductivity , however it allows to reformulate the problem . </S>",
    "<S> possible practical realization of the model is proposed in @xcite , where a source of the external pair potential has been constructed . </S>"
