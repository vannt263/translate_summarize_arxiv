    "the study of the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of membranes is a problem of broad interest in physics , being at the interface of statistical mechanics , condensed matter and field theory .",
    "recent experimental developments in growing and isolating single layers of crystalline materials , such as graphene , mos@xmath3 , ws@xmath3 , bn and similar materials @xcite , have revived the interest in the properties of crystalline membranes .",
    "the very thermodynamic stability of these two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals has been a matter of debate ( for a review see refs .  ) . at the harmonic level ,",
    "the out - of - plane modes and the in - plane modes are completely decoupled , and the contribution of both modes to the mean - square atomic displacement diverges .",
    "in this situation , anharmonic coupling between them should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "this coupling suppresses the out - of - plane instability but increases the in - plane instability . as a result , strictly speaking , no long - range - order exists at finite temperature in agreement with the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "this fact implies that bragg peaks are not infinitely sharp in the thermodynamic limit , as in 3d ideal crystals , but for stiff membranes such as graphene they are still narrow and centred at the regular reciprocal lattice sites .",
    "this situation defines precisely what we call 2d crystals  @xcite . the anharmonic coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane modes is reflected in the onset of out - of - plane ripples at any finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the impact of corrugations on electronic transport , as well as on the mechanical properties of graphene , is a subject of intense investigation @xcite .",
    "ripples have been indeed measured in atomically thick materials such as graphene @xcite or mos@xmath3 @xcite , although it is still experimentally unclear whether they are mostly thermal in nature or due to strain .",
    "a crystalline membrane is a strongly anharmonic system , and these anharmonic effects must be taken into account beyond the usual quasi - harmonic approximation ( which ignores phonon - phonon interaction ) .",
    "however , the role of strong anharmonic effects in crystalline membranes has almost exclusively been theoretically investigated in the classical regime @xcite .",
    "an exception to this are the recent works refs .   and , where both quantum and anharmonic effects are taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , ref",
    ".   neglects some relevant anharmonic terms , while both refs .   and",
    "only partially take into account quantum fluctuations , neglecting effects of retardation in the interactions .",
    "the limitation of the classical approaches to high temperatures makes them unsuitable to investigate the stability and thermodynamic properties of such compounds in the very low temperature regime , where quantum effects are dominant .",
    "even the temperature above which quantum fluctuations can be neglected and the classical analysis becomes valid has not been known until now .",
    "however , taking graphene as an example , a simple estimation of its debye temperature for the out - of - plane mode gives us a value of the order of @xmath4 k , which hints that quantum fluctuations should be relevant even at relatively high temperatures .",
    "a quantum analysis can be easily performed at the harmonic level , but the lack of coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane modes leaves the system unstable .",
    "this is reflected , for instance , in the fact that , in the thermodynamic limit and at a quasi - harmonic level , a divergent negative areal thermal expansion @xmath5 is obtained @xcite , in violation of the third law of thermodynamics , which implies that the thermal expansion should vanish at @xmath6 . in ref .  ,",
    "the effects of the interaction between out - of - plane and in - plane modes have been included simply by means of a reasonable infrared ( ir ) cutoff in the available momentum space of the harmonic model .",
    "this approach does not solve the problem because it leads to a temperature independent ( up to logarithmic accuracy ) thermal expansion @xcite .",
    "this difficulty is due to the use of the classical anharmonic theory of a crystalline membrane , which can not be extrapolated to the @xmath0 limit .",
    "another important quantity is the specific heat .",
    "the harmonic theory predicts that at very low temperature , it should be dominated by the out - of - plane mode and , due to its quadratic dispersion relation at long wavelength , the heat capacity should behave as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand how this picture changes once we include the effects of anharmonic interactions , since we know that they drastically change the properties of the out - of - plane modes @xcite .    a robust description of the lattice properties of 2d crystalline membranes , satisfying the third law of thermodynamics in the low temperature limit and properly including both quantum effects and the anharmonic coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane modes , is still lacking .",
    "in this paper , we develop a theory for anharmonic crystalline membranes in the quantum regime . toward this end",
    ", we derive an effective quantum field theory governing the dynamics of the out - of - plane modes .",
    "the in - plane modes can be integrated out rigorously leading to an effective retarded ( i. e. , frequency dependent ) interaction between out - of - plane modes .",
    "then , we study the effect of the anharmonicities by computing the self - energy to first order in perturbation theory , obtaining the corresponding corrections to the elastic constants .",
    "it is known that perturbation theory is insufficient to describe the physics of the classical version of this problem @xcite , making it necessary to use some other techniques such as @xmath8 expansion @xcite ( where @xmath9 is the membrane dimension ) , the self - consistent screening approximation ( scsa ) @xcite , or the non - perturbative renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have further worked on the first step beyond perturbation theory , by using a one - loop self - consistent theory , without including any renormalization of the in - plane lam constants , which can be viewed as the generalization of the nelson and peliti approximation @xcite to the quantum regime .",
    "the present work can therefore be seen as the first stage of the full description of quantum crystalline membranes .",
    "however , the perturbative calculation is already useful to study two problems : ( i ) assess the effect of retardation in the effective interaction between out - of - plane modes ; ( ii ) investigate the momentum space associated with anharmonic effects by applying a ginzburg criterion .",
    "comparing the perturbative calculation performed in the quantum regime at @xmath6 , with the result from the classical theory , allows us to determine a cross over temperature @xmath1 , below which quantum effects become dominant .",
    "finally , we study the effect of anharmonicities on the thermal expansion and specific heat of quantum crystalline membranes , solving the contradiction with the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "we start our analysis from the standard continuum theory for crystalline elastic membranes and thin plates @xcite .",
    "the lattice deformations of the membrane are expressed in terms of an in - plane 2d vector displacement field @xmath10 and an out - of - plane ( flexural ) displacement field @xmath11 .",
    "we will use the imaginary time functional path integral formalism , which is particularly convenient to study thermodynamic quantities .",

    "the classical treatment formally corresponds to neglecting all kinetic terms in the lagrangian density . to be able to reach the low temperature limit ,",

    "the total energy of the system can be expressed in terms of two - point correlation functions , using a modified migdal - galitskii - koltun energy sum rule @xcite .",
    "the total energy of the membrane per unit area can be written as @xmath214 with ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix_mgk_sum ] for the proof ) @xmath215 although in the anharmonic theory in - plane and out - of - plane modes are coupled , we can attribute @xmath216 mostly to out - of - plane modes and @xmath217 mostly to in - plane modes . in the same way , the specific heat can also be split in these two contributions , @xmath218 , where @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "as previously , we ignore the frequency dependence of the self - energy , and obtain the energy per unit area @xmath221 in the @xmath0 limit , making the same approximations as for the thermal expansion , we can write the specific heat at constant pressure per unit area as @xmath222 where @xmath223 . for @xmath150 , which is the value corresponding to the approximations used in this paper , we have @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "this result is to be contrasted with the one obtained at the harmonic level , which would predict @xmath226 .",
    "it is a consequence of the change of dispersion of flexural modes from @xmath227 to @xmath228 as discussed after eq .. regarding the contribution mostly due to in - plane modes , we can check that interactions lead only to a logarithmic correction of the in - plane modes correlation function ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix_self_energy ] ) , which we will neglect .",
    "therefore , the contribution mostly due to the in - plane modes reduces to the non - interacting one , which for @xmath0 reduces to the expected @xmath229 dependence @xmath230 therefore , taking into account at the same level anharmonic and quantum effects , one predicts an intermediate behavior @xmath231 resulting from the coupling between in - plane and out - of - plane modes .",
    "to first order in perturbation theory , both @xmath232 and @xmath233 are proportional to @xmath229 .",
    "notice , that the harmonic theory calculated for graphene @xcite , predicts @xmath234 up to temperatures as high as @xmath235 which is about our @xmath236 .",
    "that is why we believe that the linear @xmath57 dependence should not be observable in graphene for which we predict instead a @xmath229 dependence .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have calculated several thermodynamic properties of crystalline membranes in the low temperature quantum regime . toward that end",
    "we have employed both a first order perturbation theory as well as a one - loop self - consistent approximation in which we have ignored any possible renormalization of the in - plane lam elastic constants .",
    "we have derived the effective action for the out - of - plane modes by integrating out exactly the in - plane modes .",
    "this procedure leads to frequency dependent anharmonic interactions ( retardation effects ) which we have shown to be the dominant effect in the zero temperature limit .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the high temperature classical regime , where retardation can be ignored .",
    "we have further evaluated the leading of the anharmonic out - of - plane mode self - energy in the @xmath0 limit and estimated the available phase space , described by a crossover momentum @xmath122 , which defines a wavelength above which anharmonic effects dominate the theory in the quantum regime .",
    "for graphene we estimate @xmath237 @xmath36 , about 0.6 of the value estimated for the crossover from the harmonic to the anharmonic regime in the classical case at room temperature @xcite .",
    "based on this result , we estimate a crossover temperature @xmath1 between the classical and quantum regimes . for typical graphene parameters ,",
    "this crossover temperature is @xmath238 k.    by using the calculated correlation functions in the quantum anharmonic regime , we establish the temperature dependence of thermodynamic properties . in the @xmath0 limit , we find a power - law behavior for both the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath239 and the specific heat @xmath240 .",
    "in general they are characterized by an anomalous exponent related to the characteristic exponent @xmath148 of the elementary excitations , namely @xmath241 and @xmath242 . to first order perturbation theory , as well as in the one - loop self - consistent approximation we find @xmath150 , which means that both @xmath239 and @xmath240 are proportional to @xmath243 .",
    "this work is a first step towards the full understanding of the physics of a quantum crystalline membrane .",
    "we know that for a classical crystalline membrane , it is necessary to go beyond perturbation theory and use a more elaborate technique , such as a full self - consistent calculation . also for the quantum case , more advanced methods such as quantum monte carlo or functional renormalization group are needed to solve the problem quantitatively .",
    "nevertheless , the perturbative calculation that we have presented is already sufficient to show that a simultaneous treatment of quantum and anharmonic effects is necessary to have a vanishing thermal expansion and specific heat at zero temperature , in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "this approach also allows us to estimate the crossover temperature between the classical and the quantum regime .",
