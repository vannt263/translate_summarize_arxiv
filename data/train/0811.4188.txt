    "a detailed understanding of the properties of strongly interacting many - particle quantum systems represents one of the major challenges of theoretical physics . even for one spatial dimension ( 1d ) and",
    "local interactions very little is known about physics at high temperature , out of equilibrium , or for long real time evolution .",
    "quite recently , several original ideas emerging from the quantum information theory on the issue of entanglement in many - particle systems @xcite resulted in very useful efficient techniques for the  classical \" simulation of quantum many particle systems @xcite .",
    "even though most versions of these methods can be re - interpreted in terms of the _ density matrix renormalization group _",
    "@xcite ( for an excellent review see @xcite ) and its time - dependent generalizations @xcite they bring up a conceptual simplicity : namely , they represent the quantum many body states in terms of the so - called finitely correlated states @xcite which can be written in terms of matrix products , the so - called _ matrix product states _ ( mps ) .",
    "similarly , _ matrix product operator _ ( mpo ) ansatz can be used to describe density operators of mixed states @xcite .    yet",
    ", most of these ingenious numerical methods turned out to be effective _ only _ for calculation of ground states , low temperature equilibrium states , or time evolved states for short time or starting from particular ( e.g. few  quasi - particle \" ) initial conditions .",
    "the calculation of asymptotic time evolution in the thermodynamic limit , and the properties of _ non - equilibrium steady states _ ( ness ) , remains notoriously difficult due to typical growth of bi - partite entanglement in generic non - integrable systems and consequent exponential growth of the dimension of the relevant many - particle hilbert space @xcite .",
    "therefore , the regularity to quantum chaos transition is manifested in the difficulty of classical simulation of quantum many - body dynamics @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "even though promising analytical techniques based on fock spaces of operators have been developed recently in terms of which one can access ness and relaxation properties of certain open integrable quantum many - body systems far from equilibrium @xcite , for generic non - integrable systems one still needs to rely on more or less sophisticated  brute force \" methods limited at present to 20 - 30 spins 1/2 ( or qubits , fermions ) in 1d . for such small systems",
    "it is often difficult or impossible to conclude on asymptotic thermodynamic properties due to considerable finite size effects .    in this paper",
    "we shall put forward a hypothesis that ness of certain _ open _ 1d systems can be efficiently simulated in terms of mpo ansatz .    our idea is based on the following arguments .",
    "it has been shown rigorously that ground states of several interacting many - particles systems in 1d can be written in terms of mps ( for example , the so - called _ valence bond states _",
    "later , it has been shown @xcite , using the arguments of conformal field theory , that ground state entanglement entropy of a finite block of size @xmath1 in any non - critical ( gaped ) system in 1d saturates with @xmath1 , whereas for critical ( non - gaped ) systems the growth of entanglement entropy is at most logarithmic in @xmath1 .",
    "this result immediately implies that an efficient mps representation of ground states in 1d should exist with the dimension of the parameterizing matrices which saturates or grows not faster than polynomially with the system size @xmath1 .",
    "similar  strong efficiency \" result can be claimed for thermal states @xcite .",
    "the defining equation for ness of an open - quantum system can be written as ",
    "right ground state \" of a certain non - hermitian quantum liouville master operator @xcite , hence ness can be thought of as a kind of non - normal ground state in the liouville space .",
    "this means that the entanglement of ness , treated as an element of the hilbert space of operators , can be relatively weak for a a wide class of ( non - integrable ) problems even though the operator space entanglement of generic operators is much stronger ( e.g. of the `` excited '' eigenstates of liouville master operator , i.e. decay modes ) .",
    "if this intuition is correct then ness should be simulable in terms of mpo ansatz for systems considerably longer than @xmath2 spins ( at present ) .    in the present work we are going to test mpo method on ness calculation of different 1d systems , integrable and chaotic , as well as normal and ideal conductors . in particular , we shall focus on the problem of diffusive versus ballistic spin / heat transport in spin chains .",
    "there have been basically two approaches to quantum transport .",
    "the first one is using the linear response formalism , calculating equilibrium time correlation functions . in that approach one studies purely hamiltonian system , _",
    "i.e. _ , without any external baths , either directly ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , or in terms of conformal field theory  @xcite , or quantum monte carlo  @xcite . for exact calculations spin chains of sizes up to @xmath3",
    "are achievable using a micro - canonical finite temperature lanczos method  @xcite . for a discussion of applicability of green - kubo formalism",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the second approach goes via direct simulation of out - of - equilibrium system coupled to the baths , usually using a master equation  @xcite solving it by either numerical integration , diagonalization , or monte carlo wave - function approach .",
    "using these methods one can study chains of up to @xmath4 spins  @xcite .",
    "using mpo approach for solving master equation proposed in the present paper we can calculate ness of @xmath5 spins .",
    "even though we are at present unable to give a precise statement about the efficiency of the method for a general ness ( for an exception due to exact solvability see  @xcite ) , mpo approach should nevertheless prove very useful in studying out - of - equilibrium quantum many - body phenomena .",
    "in section [ sec : master ] we outline our numerical algorithm of computation of ness in terms of mpo ansatz as an asymptotic time - dependent solution of quantum ( lindblad ) master equation .",
    "we also describe in details efficient models of the baths used in our calculations . in sections",
    "[ sec : main1 ] and [ sec : main2 ] we discuss our numerical results for ness and their transport properties in several integrable and non - integrable models of quantum spin chains , whereas in section [ sec : disc ] we summarize our findings and conclude .",

    "formally , the solution of linear lindblad equation can be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a liouvillean super - operator corresponding to the right - hand - side of the lindblad eq.([eq : lin ] ) .",
    "we are going to simulate the time - evolution under the lindblad equation by using a matrix product operator ( mpo ) formulation . for a chain of @xmath1",

    "for example , @xmath35 contains terms with interactions between 2nd and 3rd spin , 4th and 5th spin , and so on , while @xmath36 contains interactions between other pairs , whereas the corresponding one - body terms are distributed evenly between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for each small time step",
    "we use trotter - suzuki formula , @xmath37 , with an appropriate scheme having either @xmath38 or @xmath39 , depending on the required accuracy .",

    "an error made in such a truncation is given by a sum of truncated @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "as a rough estimate of a minimal needed matrix dimension @xmath40 one can use von neumann entropy of a super - ket denoted by @xmath52 , also called _ operator space entanglement entropy _ ( osee ) ( for an earlier definition in a different context see  @xcite ) . in terms of coefficients",

    ".      let us say a few words about the details of our implementation of markovian baths , that is of a non - unitary part @xmath58 of @xmath12 , involving lindblad operators @xmath9 . in our case - as",
    "our goal is to simulate _ many - body coherent transport _ in one dimension - the baths , i.e. , the lindblad operators @xmath9 , will act only at the two _ ends _ of a 1d chain .",
    "more precisely , they will act just on the first and the last spin for a _ single - spin _ bath , or just on the first two and the last two spins for a _ two - spin _ bath . for a single spin bath",
    ", we put @xmath58 as part of @xmath59 as it commutes with all the other terms , so in the corresponding suzuki - trotter propagator @xmath60 factorizes out .",
    "our choice of @xmath9 will be such that @xmath58 will have a single non - degenerate eigenvalue equal to @xmath61 with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath62 being a local equilibrium state , i.e. a direct product of thermal states of ( each of ) the edge spins , or the pairs of the edge spins .",
    "furthermore , due to stability of completely positive dynamics , all other eigenvalues of @xmath58 should have negative real parts .    as a consequence , @xmath63 will for sufficiently long time converge to ness @xmath64 of the entire spin chain , if starting from a generic initial state @xmath65 having a non - zero overlap with @xmath66 .",
    "due to _ ergodicity of the internal coherent dynamics _",
    "generated by the hamiltonian @xmath8 , we assume : ( i ) the resulting ness @xmath66 will be unique , i.e. independent of the details of the initial condition @xmath65 , ( ii ) the resulting ness @xmath66 will be ( for _ complex - say non - integrable and quantum chaotic - internal dynamics _ ) independent of the details of the bath operators @xmath9 - and will only depend on thermodynamic bath parameters , such as temperature , magnetization , chemical potential , etc .",
    "both assumptions have been carefully checked and confirmed in the numerical simulations which are reported bellow .    since non - unitary evolution",
    "does not preserve schmidt decomposition structure of matrices @xmath26 we apply local rotations every few steps in order to `` reorthogonalize '' matrices @xmath26 , recovering the schmidt decomposition @xcite .",
    "we note that ref.@xcite originally proposed the idea to use mpo for time - dependent solutions of lindblad master equation , however it implemented it in a physically essentially different context of systems with bulk - dissipation where each spin has been monitored by a lindbladian bath .",
    "the fact that operator space entanglement is rather small in such a situation is not surprising , neither is the fact that it can not describe coherent out - of - equilibrium many - body phenomena .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to test the efficiency of mpo simulation of ness as given by the asymptotic @xmath67 solution of the master equation driven only by the _ boundary _",
    "lindblad terms , for different ( integrable and non - integrable ) 1d spin chains , checking along the way their transport behavior being for instance that of a normal ( diffusive ) conductor or displaying anomalous transport .",
    "one expects that quantum chaotic systems will display normal conduction @xcite , that is , they will obey fourier / fick / ohm s law in which the current @xmath68 is proportional to the gradient of a driving field @xmath69 , say local energy density / temperature ( or spin density / magnetization , or particle density / chemical potential , etc ) @xmath70 for such normal conductors the transport properties should not depend on the details of the baths ( assumption ( ii ) above ) . on the other hand , for the integrable models the choice of the baths could play a role .",
    "we are going to use two different models of the baths . in studies of spin conduction in the heisenberg model",
    "we will use a single - spin bath while we are going to use a two - spin bath when studying energy transport in a quantum chaotic tilted ising model .",
    "the reason for using a two - spin bath was in a better ( faster ) convergence to ness with time @xmath71 and size @xmath1 , which is probably due to the fact that the energy - density is a two - body operator , while the spin - density is a one - body operator .      when studying the spin ( magnetic ) transport we are going to couple the first and the last spin of the chain to a single - spin bath . for simplicity we shall bellow write only one part of @xmath58 pertaining to a given edge spin , being either @xmath72 or @xmath73 and omitting the index @xmath20 .",

    "we stress that this is a stationary state of a single spin in the absence of hamiltonian evolution .",
    "parameters @xmath78 of the left and right bath , respectively , play a role of an external thermodynamic potential enforcing a spin - density gradient , say a magnetization of a macroscopic magnet in contact with the edge spin .",

    "so far the choice of @xmath9 s is not unique as we have fixed only one eigenvector and the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath58 .",
    "so in addition we shall require that all other ( negative ) eigenvalues of @xmath58 are equal to @xmath88 .",
    "such @xmath58 will produce the fastest possible convergence to @xmath83 for a given fixed spectral norm of @xmath58 .    assuming first that @xmath89 is diagonal one can easily check that the following set of lindblad operators @xmath9 , @xmath90 results in @xmath91 satisfying the above conditions . note that the above 16 lindblad operators , labeled by a double index @xmath92 , can in fact be replaced by a set of 15 traceless operators leading to the same @xmath91 . in the pauli basis",

    "in the present paper we have demonstrated numerical simulation of ness for strongly but locally interacting open quantum systems in 1d in terms of the mpo ansatz .",
    "we have considered the most difficult case where dynamics in the bulk is fully coherent ( hamiltonian ) , and dissipation ( coupling to the baths ) only takes place at the boundary ( ends of the chain ) . in this setting",
    "we have been able to confirm the laws of diffusive transport , such as fourier s law of heat conduction and ( spin ) fick s law for spin conduction , in the cases where the underlying model is strongly non - integrable and displays the features of quantum chaos , or even when it is integrable but all the conserved quantities are irrelevant for the transporting current , like in the case of spin - conduction in ising - like heisenberg xxz chain .",
    "the main purpose of our paper was to demonstrate that such simulations were now possible for system sizes of order of @xmath128 spins 1/2 , which is considerably larger than with the competing methods ( usually based on monte carlo wave - function techniques , where presently only @xmath189 is reachable for fully out - of - equilibrium simulations ) .",
    "as for the quantitative analysis of the efficiency of mpo ansatz for ness we have analyzed the spectrum of the schmidt decomposition for the worst - case ( half - half ) bipartition of the chain , when treating the density matrix of ness as an element of the hilbert space of operators . summarizing these results , we have found that _ completely integrable _ and _ ideally conducting cases _ , in our example @xmath190-like heisenberg xxz chain ( @xmath191 ) , are easiest to simulate since there the tail of the spectrum of schmidt coefficients decays exponentially so mpo of a rather modest matrix dimension gives a good description of ness .    for still integrable systems , but for which all the conservation laws are irrelevant to the transporting current in ness , such as the ising - like heisenberg xxz chain ( @xmath192 ) , we have found qualitatively worse efficiency , namely there the tails of the schmidt spectrum appear to exhibit power law tails @xmath193 .    at last , for non - integrable systems in the regime of quantum - chaos",
    ", the efficiency of simulation appears again worse than in the integrable cases above ( in our examples we have looked into the heisenberg xxz chain in a staggered transverse field , and ising spin chain in a tilted magnetic field ) .",
    "namely , there we have found algebraically decaying tails of the schmidt spectrum @xmath194 with the power @xmath195 $ ] .",
    "based on our results we also conclude that zero - temperature ( ground state ) properties of the system , whether being critical or gaped , do not influence far - from - equlibrium properties of ness .    the work has been financially supported by program p1 - 0044 and grant j1 - 7347 of slovenian research agency ( arrs ) .",
