    "the pole configurations of the corresponding potentials were studied earlier by airault , mckean and moser @xcite in relation to rational solutions of the kdv equation .",
    "oblomkov @xcite generalised duistermaat - grnbaum s result to the quadratic growth case .",
    "he showed that all the rational monodromy - free operators with rational potentials growing as @xmath7 at infinity are the results of darboux transformations applied to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the corresponding potentials have the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-th hermite polynomial , @xmath11 is a sequence of different positive integers and @xmath12 is the wronskian of functions @xmath13    we are interested in the geometry of the pole configurations of the corresponding potentials ( _ locus _ in the terminology of airault , mckean and moser ) , which are the same as the zero sets of the corresponding wronskians .",
    "this locus has an interesting relationship with the calogero - moser problem and log - gas in a harmonic field , see @xcite . in the case when @xmath14 are consequent numbers it can be also interpreted as the pole set of some rational solutions of the fourth painlev equation and has a regular rectangle - like structure in the complex plane , as was revealed numerically by clarkson @xcite .",
    "a natural question is what kind of pattern do we have in general .",
    "let us label these potentials by partitions @xmath15 such that @xmath16 @xmath17    our main observation ( based on numerical experiments using mathematica ) is that although for a general partition @xmath18 the picture is quite complicated , for its doubled version @xmath19 there exists a simple qualitative relation between the shape of the young diagram and the pattern of zeroes of the corresponding wronskian .    in the case of the two - term wronskian @xmath0 we have some quantitative results .",
    "namely , for fixed @xmath10 and large @xmath20 we give an explicit formula for the curve the scaled zeroes @xmath21 in the region @xmath22 lie on asymptotically : @xmath23 is the @xmath10-th chebyshev polynomial .",
    "the distribution of the real parts of the zeroes on this curve satisfy wigner s semicircle law .",
    "the derivation is based on a version of the classical plancherel - rotach formula @xcite found by deift et al in @xcite .",
    "we give also some empirical formulas for the three and four - term wronskians .",

    "what is important for us is that @xmath32 are the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator : @xmath33    let @xmath34 be a partition and consider the wronskian @xmath35    the wronskians @xmath36 have the following properties :    _ 1 .",

    ", width=377 ]    since the wronskians are labelled by the partitions , we can ask a natural question : how is the geometry of the corresponding diagram of @xmath18 related to the pattern of the zeroes of @xmath37 ?",
    "figure [ comp ] , produced with the help of mathematica , shows that in general such a relation is not easy to see .",
    "another example is the partition @xmath52 with a triangular young diagram , for which the corresponding wronskian @xmath36 ( up to a multiple ) is simply @xmath53",
    "so we just have one zero at @xmath54 with multiplicity @xmath55     with @xmath56 .",

    "however , for the doubled partitions there is another natural way to represent them , which combines both the usual and the french ways .",
    "namely one can put the diagram of @xmath18 in all 4 quadrants as in fig .",
    "one can naturally define the ferrers version , which we combine with the young version by putting bullets at the centre of each box .     for @xmath61,width=377 ]",

    "the following asymptotic analysis shows the limits of this comparison already in the simplest case of one - row young diagram @xmath18 .",
    "consider now the two - term wronskian @xmath0 , corresponding to the partition @xmath70 let us fix @xmath10 and let @xmath71 to study this behaviour of zeroes in this limit we can use the following version of plancherel - rotach formula due to deift et al @xcite .    in the scaled variable @xmath72",
