    "core - collapse supernovae and their remnant neutron stars are an important source of information pertaining to both superdense matter and nuclei far from the valley of stability . at present , however , important open questions remain in the understanding of the structure and dynamics of neutron stars , such as their size , composition , and cooling mechanism .",
    "increased knowledge of these issues may in turn lead to a better understanding of stellar burning and heavy - element nucleosynthesis .",
    "the structure of spherical neutron stars in hydrostatic equilibrium , the so - called schwarszchild stars , is solely determined by the equation of state of neutron - rich matter in beta equilibrium .",
    "such an equation of state is well represented as the sum of two distinct components : _",
    "i ) _ a symmetric ( @xmath1 ) component that is well constrained at saturation density plus _ ii ) _ a symmetry energy that accounts for any possible neutron - proton imbalance .",
    "some of the important neutron - star properties mentioned above depend critically on the poorly known density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "indeed , as a result of the saturation of symmetric nuclear matter , most of the pressure supporting the star up to about two times saturation density is provided by the symmetry energy .    in a set of recent papers ,",
    "the sensitivity of the symmetry energy to changes in the model lagrangian was investigated  @xcite .",
    "the model lagrangian was modified by introducing nonlinear couplings between the isoscalar and the isovector mesons .",
    "these new terms enable one to modify the neutron skin of heavy nuclei without changing ground - state properties that are well constrained experimentally .",
    "it should be noted that precise information on the neutron radius of a heavy nucleus@xmath0pb  might soon become available via a parity - violating electron scattering experiment at the jefferson laboratory that promises a 1% accuracy  @xcite .",
    "while such a measurement will provide the most accurate determination of the neutron density of a nucleus to date , it will also impact strongly on astrophysical observables .",
    "indeed , a model - independent ( or data - to - data ) relation between the neutron skin of @xmath0pb and the crust of a neutron star was recently established  @xcite .",
    "this strong correlation emerges as a result of the similar composition of the neutron skin of a heavy nucleus and the crust of a neutron star , namely , neutron - rich matter at similar densities .",
    "further , the measurement of the neutron skin of @xmath0pb constrains the cooling mechanism in neutron stars .",
    "a small neutron radius ( @xmath2 ) suggests a soft symmetry energy which favors a small proton fraction in dense matter . in turn",
    ", a low proton concentration rules out the enhanced cooling of neutron stars via the direct urca process  @xcite .",
    "if urca cooling is indeed ruled out , then observations of enhanced cooling may provide strong evidence in support of exotic states of matter at the core of neutron stars ( see , for example , ref .",

    "no place is this more evident than in the neutron - rich oxygen isotopes .",

    ", most theoretical calculations predict the existence of the `` doubly magic '' nucleus @xmath6o .",
    "this issue continues to be revisited in light of a remarkable experiment that shows that the mere addition of a single proton stabilizes the fluorine chain up to @xmath7f ; this is six more neutrons than in @xmath3o  @xcite .    in this",
    " our first  study of neutron - rich nuclei , we focus on the effect of the new isoscalar - isovector terms on ground - state properties .",
    "this study will be conducted within the framework of relativistic mean - field models that reproduce a large body of ground - state observables for nuclei at , or near , the valley of stability .",
    "yet these observables are mostly insensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "it is the aim of the present study to constrain the symmetry energy through a systematic study of ground - state properties of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "while we recognize that additional physics , such as pairing , may be needed for more realistic studies , we limit ourselves to study the impact of the bulk symmetry energy on the ground - state properties of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "further , we focus on self - consistent mean - field models in the hope of extending earlier studies of the linear response  @xcite to incorporate the new isoscalar - isovector terms .    the manuscript has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we review briefly the relativistic formalism paying special attention to the role of the new isoscalar - isovector couplings .",
    "we illustrate how these new couplings modify the density dependence of the symmetry energy while leaving unchanged all properties of symmetric nuclear matter . in sec .",

    "in this section we describe in some detail the model lagrangian employed in this work and the mean - field approximation used to compute ground - state properties for a variety of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "although most of the derivations are standard , a review is included here to illustrate the role of the mixed isoscalar - isovector meson terms first introduced in ref .",

    "indeed , by fitting the constants that parametrize these meson terms to the bulk properties of nuclei , rather than to two - nucleon data , the complicated dynamics originating from nucleon exchange , short - range effects , and many - body correlations get implicitly encoded in a small number of empirical constants . for the purpose of the present discussion ,",
    "the following local meson terms are sufficient : @xmath15 where the following definitions have been introduced : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the inclusion of scalar - meson interactions ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) is dictated by the empirical value of the compression modulus of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density ( @xmath21  mev ) .",
    "in contrast , quartic vector self - interactions ( @xmath22 ) affect primarily the high - density component of the equation of state ; their impact at densities below normal nuclear - matter saturation density is yet to be determined  @xcite .",
    "finally , the nonlinear mixed isoscalar - isovector couplings ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are powerful terms because they can be used to modify the density dependence of the symmetry energy  @xcite while not influencing ground state properties .",
    "while power counting suggests that other local meson terms ( such as mixed scalar - vector cubic terms and quartic rho - meson self - interactions ) may be equally important  @xcite , their phenomenological impact has been documented to be small  @xcite , so they will be not be considered in this study .",
    "the field equations resulting from the above lagrangian may be solved exactly in the mean - field limit by replacing all meson - field operators by their expectation values , which are classical fields  @xcite . for a static , spherically symmetric system this implies ( using @xmath25 ) :    @xmath26    similarly , the various baryon sources to which these mesons couple must be replaced by their ( normal - ordered ) expectation values in the mean - field ground state .",
    "that is ,    @xmath27    note that the proton isospin projection operator has been defined as @xmath28 .",
    "the baryon sources generate ( classical ) meson fields that satisfy coupled , nonlinear klein - gordon equations of the following form :    @xmath29    [ kleingordoneqn ]    the photon field couples only to the ( point ) proton density and its solution is thus reduced to quadratures @xmath30\\;.\\ ] ] the eigenstates of the dirac equation , for the spherically symmetric mean - field ground state assumed here , may be classified according to a generalized angular momentum @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the single - particle solutions of the dirac equation may be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes a two - component ( pauli ) spinor in isospin space ( with @xmath34 for protons and neutrons , respectively ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the principal and magnetic quantum numbers , respectively , and the spin - spherical harmonics are defined as @xmath37 note that the phase convention adopted in eq .",
    "( [ uspinor ] ) ( _ i.e. , _ the relative factor of @xmath38 ) is such that real bound - state wave functions ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are generated if the mean - field potentials are also real .",
    "further , the following spinor normalization has been adopted : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the collection of all quantum numbers required to describe the single - particle dirac spinor .",
    "it then follows that the coupled differential equations satisfied by the radial components of the dirac spinor are given by    @xmath43f_{a}(r)=0\\ ; , \\phantom{xxxx } \\\\    & &    \\left(\\frac{d}{dr}-\\frac{\\varkappa}{r}\\right)f_{a}(r )   + \\left[e_{a}-m+\\phi_{0}(r)-w_{0}(r)\\mp\\frac{1}{2}b_{0}(r )   -e\\left\\ {      \\begin{array}{c }   1 \\\\   0 \\end{array }    \\right\\}a_{0}(r )    \\right]g_{a}(r)=0\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ diraceqn ]    where the upper and lower numbers in these equations correspond to protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "having determined all occupied single - particle states , the various ground - state densities , which act as sources for the meson fields in the klein - gordon equations [ see eq .",
    "( [ kleingordoneqn ] ) ] , may now be computed .",
    "they are given by    @xmath44    where scalar and vector densities have been defined as @xmath45 ground - state properties of the system are described by a solution of the coupled , ordinary differential equations for the classical meson fields [ eq .  ( [ kleingordoneqn ] ) ] and for the dirac single - particle states [ eq .  ( [ diraceqn ] ) ] .",
    "the solution must be self - consistent , that is , the meson fields generating the dirac mean - field potentials must satisfy klein - gordon equations having ground - state densities constructed from the same single - particle states as their sources .",
    "thus , an iterative procedure must be implemented .",
    "the self - consistent procedure starts with initial woods - saxon shaped meson fields of reasonable strength and range to generate , via a conventional runge - kutta algorithm , bound - state energies and corresponding wave functions for all occupied single - particle states . at this point ,",
    "scalar and vector densities ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) are computed . using these as sources for the meson - field equations ,",
    "new meson fields are generated by using green s function techniques .",
    "the newly generated meson fields will differ , in general , from the initial woods - saxon guess .",
    "thus , this iterative procedure must continue until self - consistency ( convergence ) is achieved .",
    "the symmetry energy of infinite nuclear matter impacts on the dynamics of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "after all , the symmetry energy describes how the energy of nuclear matter increases as the system departs from equal numbers of neutrons and protons . to investigate the structure of neutron - rich nuclei we use a variety of effective field theory ( eft ) models that differ in their prediction for the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "three models will be considered in this text : the very successful nl3  @xcite along with the newer s271 and z271  @xcite parameter sets .",
    "the s271 and z271 models are alike the nl3 in that they are constrained to the following properties of symmetric nuclear matter : _ i ) _ nuclear saturation at a fermi momentum of @xmath48  @xmath49 , _ ii ) _ a binding energy per nucleon of @xmath50 mev , and _",

    "the predictions are within one percent of the experimental values , except for the neutron radius which is poorly known . the nonlinear coupling ( @xmath24 ) between the isoscalar and the isovector mesons [ see eq .",
    "( [ ueffective ] ) ] enables one to modify the density dependence of the symmetry energy , and thus the neutron radius of @xmath0pb , while leaving well - known ground - state properties intact .",
    "this suggests that existing ground - state information , such as charge densities and binding energies , do not determine the neutron radius uniquely .",
    "thus , a new measurement , such as the neutron radius in @xmath0pb  @xcite , is needed to provide important constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "it is therefore the aim of this paper to correlate ground - state properties of neutron - rich nuclei to the neutron radius of @xmath0pb .",

    "( for simplicity , we set the isoscalar - isovector coupling @xmath23 to zero henceforth . ) note that changing @xmath24 has no effect on the bulk properties of symmetric nuclear matter as the expectation value of the rho - meson field is identically zero in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "it does affect the value of the symmetry energy so a mild adjustment of the @xmath57 coupling constant is required to keep the symmetry energy fixed at @xmath58  mev ; this ensures that the binding energy per nucleon in @xmath0pb remains fixed at @xmath59  mev  @xcite .    in fig .",

    "<S> a relativistic mean - field model is used to study the ground - state properties of neutron - rich nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear isoscalar - isovector terms , unconstrained by present day phenomenology , are added to the model lagrangian in order to modify the poorly known density dependence of the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> these new terms soften the symmetry energy and reshape the theoretical neutron drip line without compromising the agreement with existing ground - state information . a strong correlation between the neutron radius of @xmath0pb and the binding energy of valence orbitals </S>",
    "<S> is found : the smaller the neutron radius of @xmath0pb , the weaker the binding energy of the last occupied neutron orbital . </S>",
    "<S> thus , models with the softest symmetry energy are the first ones to drip neutrons . further , in anticipation of the upcoming one - percent measurement of the neutron radius of @xmath0pb at the thomas jefferson laboratory , a close relationship between the neutron radius of @xmath0pb and neutron radii of elements of relevance to atomic parity - violating experiments is established . </S>"
