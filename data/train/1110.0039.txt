    "in some of his early attempts of developping a many - body theory of nuclei , brueckner assumed the in - medium ( effective ) two - body interaction to be @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the scattering phase - shift as a function of relative momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the initial problem studied was that of an infinite system of nuclear matter for the purpose of calculating binding energy and saturation properties .",
    "the @xmath13 approximation came from the assumption that the reactance matrix , a part of scattering theory , could be used as an in - medium interaction in the many - body problem .",
    "( the diagonal part of this matrix is @xmath10 ) .",
    "this implies that a principal value green s function with an integration over a semi - continuous spectrum would be justified in this case with the box of nuclear matter assumed to be very and even infinitely large .",
    "this assumption was substantiated in a paper by reifman and dewitt@xcite .",
    "it was however soon realised to be incorrect .",
    "several authors ( one of them dewitt ) showed that the correct limit for two particles in a big box would yield an in - medium interaction @xmath14 rather than @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite e.g. at low density this might not make any difference but for problems of interest to - day with @xmath15 it obviously would . ] the reactance matrix is part of scattering theory . the nuclear matter problem assumes a box , although large but still finite with boundary conditions different from that of scattering theory .",
    "a particle in this box has a discrete rather than a continuous spectrum and that makes a difference ..    the proofs in the referred papers differ but the essential point is that the integration over the continuous spectrum vs the summation over the discrete spectrum differs even though the level - density in a big box goes to zero as the box - size increases .",
    "the principal value integration relates to the scattering problem with boundary conditions different from that for a box where the wave - functions are zero at the edge of the box even in the limit of infinitely large .",
    "the exact statement of the results in the referenced papers is that the energy - shift @xmath5 due to the interaction of two - particles confined in a spherical box in the limit when the size of the box approaches infinity is given by @xmath16 where @xmath1 is the spacing between the levels of the unperturbed spectrum and @xmath17 in nuclear matter studies this has been referred to as the phase - shift approximation a term adopted here .",
    "it was for example used in early calculations on the neutron - gas@xcite and used as a first approximation for nuclear matter studies.@xcite    the question of the author arose whether the result above might be more general .",
    "the problem of two particles trapped in a potential well is of interest for atomic as well as nuclear physics studies .",
    "the busch - formula@xcite relates the _ energy - spectra of the two particles in a harmonic oscillator well to the scattering phase - shifts for point - like potentials .",
    "this formula is here rewritten in terms of the _ energy - shifts rather than energy .",
    "results below show that the phase - shift approximation for these shifts is ( surprisingly ) in practically exact agreement with the busch - formula .",
    "the largest difference is found for the lowest energy - state ( @xmath18 ) and small scattering length but it decreases rapidly for @xmath19 and larger scattering lengths . for comparison are also shown results for the spherical infinite square well as a function of the radius of the sphere . although the approximation becomes exact in the limit @xmath7 , it is in general much worse in this case than for the h.o . _ _",
    "with the energy in units of @xmath20 the total energy for two non - interacting particles with zero angular momentum in a 3-d harmonic oscillator well is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the center - of mass energy .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath23 as the unit of length . with @xmath24",
    "the busch - formula reads @xcite @xmath25}{2\\gamma[(3-\\eta)/4 ] } \\label{busch}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 .",
    "the level - spacing in the uncorrelated system is @xmath27 and following the notation above one finds the level - shift to be @xmath28 . in the case of the spherical box above @xmath29 is given by eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to find @xmath29 for the 3-d h.o . with the busch spectrum .",
    "one finds @xmath30 . using the reflection formula for @xmath31-functions",
    "@xmath32 one finds    @xmath33    where    @xmath34    with z = n+s+1 .",
    "the beta - function @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36    and for @xmath37 fixed and @xmath38 large one has .",
    "@xmath39    so that for @xmath40 large one would have @xmath41 but in eq .",
    "( [ busch3 ] ) one has the factor @xmath42 .",
    "numerical tests show that a better approximation indeed is @xmath43    one finds that the values of @xmath40 that is needed in the busch - formula is @xmath44 and fig .",
    "[ bush1 ] shows the function @xmath45 for a useful range of @xmath40 .",
    "one finds @xmath46 quite rapidly with @xmath40 ( and consequently with @xmath47 ) so that in this limit eq .",
    "( [ busch2 ] ) yields @xmath48 which is the phase - shift approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "a correction @xmath49 to @xmath29 due to @xmath50 is obtained from @xmath51 this shows a dampening of the correction with increasing value of @xmath52 . in the limit when @xmath53 the correction goes to zero .",
    "the energy - shift is then exactly given by @xmath54 , a well - known result.@xcite fig .",
    "[ bush2 ] shows the difference between the energy shifts calculated by the busch - formula and the phase - shift - approximation for quantum levels @xmath55 and @xmath56 as a function of scattering length .",
    "it is seen to decrease rapidly with @xmath47 and also with @xmath57 .",
    "the peaks are a result of the competition between the @xmath45 and @xmath58 corrections respectively shown in eq .",
    "( [ correct ] ) .",
    "[ bush3 ] shows the same differences but in @xmath59 of the busch result for @xmath60 again showing the rapid decrease with increasing values of @xmath47 and with @xmath57 .",
    "the problem of two particles in a spherical box was treated by several authors referred to in the introduction . in these several works",
    "the emphasis was on the energy - shift in the limit of the radius of the sphere going to infinity with the result given by eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , the phase - shift approximation . for comparison with the 3-d h.o .",
    "it is of interest to also display the shift as a function of the ratio of scattering length to radius and as a function of quantum - numbers @xmath47 of the spherical box .    the simplest solution @xcite of the problem at hand is to explicitly consider the wave - functions of the two particles in this box .",
    "considering only @xmath61-states the radial wavefunctions of free non - interacting particles are @xmath62 with two - body interaction the wave - function outside the range of the two - body interaction is @xmath63    the boundary condition implies that the wave - functions vanish at the boundary of the sphere assumed to have a radius @xmath6 .",
    "( one immediately sees the simplicity of the formalism relative to that of the 3-d h.o . or a cubical box . )",
    "thus , for the non - interacting case @xmath64 and for the interacting case @xmath65    the spacing between unperturbed levels is @xmath66    the energy shift @xmath67 divided by the unperturbed energyspacing , i.e. @xmath29 , is then    @xmath68    the energy - shifts and -spacings decrease with @xmath6 and @xmath47 @xmath69 and then @xmath70 as before .",
    "the phase - shift approximation was tested for convergence as a function of box radius @xmath6 and quantum number @xmath47 . for this purpose",
    "the expression for @xmath29 was rewritten as follows @xmath71    the radius @xmath6 only appears implicitly through the relation @xmath72 to be solved selfconsistently .    in the ( unphysical ) case",
    "that @xmath73 would be independent of @xmath12 one would have the situation where @xmath29 is independent of @xmath6 , but only of @xmath47 and of course of @xmath73 .    fig .",
    "[ sphere1 ] shows the difference between the exact shift and the phase - shift approximation @xmath74 of eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , while fig .",
    "[ sphere2 ] shows the difference in @xmath59 of the exact shift .",
    "compared with the analogous result for the h.o .",
    "there are notable differences . while the largest deviation from the phase - shift approximation is @xmath3 ( and typically much smaller ) in the h.o .",
    "case , it can for the sphere be even as large as @xmath75 . but",
    "even though the devation from the phase - shift approximation in the h.o",
    ". is small it has its maximum for large values of @xmath76 ( or small scattering lengths ) while going to zero for small values ( or large scattering lengths ) , which is opposite to the situation encoutered for the spherical well .",
    "both figs .",
    "[ sphere1 ] and [ sphere2 ] illustrate however the known result that @xmath77 as @xmath78 as shown in previous works already referred to above.@xcite .",
    "the phase - shift approximation @xmath79 for the energy - shift due to the interaction of two partcles in a trap , where @xmath11 is the free particle scattering phase - shift and de the energy - level spacing of the unperturbed spectrum , has been investigated .",
    "the traps considered were a 3-d harmonic oscillator and a spherical infinite square well .",
    "the square - well case was treated a long time ago as referenced above , with the main emphasis on the large size limit of the trap with the result expressed by eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "somewhat of a surprise was the finding of the present investigation that a not only somewhat similar situation exists for the h.o .",

    ", it is assumed that the range of the potential is small compared to the size of the trap .",
    "considerations of range corrections are beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "it has been the subject of a recent publication.@xcite    the question arises of course whether the phase - shift approximation has a more general validity e.g. for the shifts in a cubical box , as derived by lscher.@xcite it is however already seen that the situation is rather different in the 3-d h.o .",
