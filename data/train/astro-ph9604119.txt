    ". these clusters may be highly assymetric and have significant degrees of substructure .",
    "dense , centrally concentrated clusters , such as coma , contain predominantly early  type galaxies in their cores ( abell 1958 ; oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ) .",
    "these clusters have a single , outstanding concentration among the bright member galaxies and typically display a high  degree of spherical symmetry .",

    "density relation of galaxies ; as the local density increases , the fraction of elliptical ( e ) and s0 galaxies increases , while the fraction of spiral galaxies decreases ( dressler 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing results of the study of intermediate and high  redshift clusters of galaxies has been strong evolution in the galaxy population .",
    "butcher & oemler ( 1984 ; hereafter bo ) were the first to make a comprehensive study of intermediate redshift clusters with regard to their galaxy populations .",
    "they examined the fraction of blue galaxies ( @xmath8 ) in 33 clusters at @xmath14 .",
    "they found that @xmath8 is an increasing function of redshift in both open and compact clusters of galaxies , indicating that clusters at these redshifts are significantly bluer than their low ",
    "redshift counterparts .",
    "recent hst image data ( dressler et al .  1994 ; couch et al .  1994 ; oemler , dressler & butcher 1996 ) reveal that many of these blue ( @xmath15 ) galaxies are either `` normal '' spirals or have peculiar morphologies , producing non  elliptical fractions which are 3 to 5 times higher than the average current epoch cluster .",
    "fading through cessation of star formation may play a role in this evolution .",
    "gunn & dressler ( 1988 ) find that the spectra of cluster galaxies with @xmath9 show , on average , smaller 4000@xmath16 decrements and a higher frequency of post  starburst features ( the  e+a \" spectral class ) than those at @xmath17 ( however , see zabludoff et al .",

    "this trend is also well studied by rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) in an intermediate and high  redshift sample of 17 rich clusters .",
    "they find the fraction of blue galaxies increases from 20% at @xmath20 to 80% at @xmath21 using strmgren photometry in the cluster rest - frame .",
    "in addition , the red envelope , presumably that of the early  type population , moves _ bluewards _ with redshift ( a93 ; rakos & schombert 1995 ; oke , gunn & hoessel 1996 ) . at @xmath22 , there are few cluster members with colors as red as present  day ellipticals ( see also smail et al .",
    "the color distribution of this high - redshift elliptical population is relatively narrow , and the trend is uniform from cluster to cluster ; this suggests a homogeneous population which formed within a narrow time span ( e.g.  bower , lucey & ellis 1992a , b ) .",

    ", we briefly describe the pdcs , the original photometric reduction , and the cluster sample used in this analysis .",
    "the evolution in the color distributions of the cluster galaxies is presented in  3 .",
    "the butcher  oemler effect ( the fraction of blue galaxies as a function of redshift ) is presented in  4 .",
    "we summarize the results in  5 .",
    "the observations , data reduction , and cluster catalog are the subject of the first paper in this series ( postman et al . 1996 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "however , we discuss briefly the aspects of the original survey which are necessary for the following analysis . the cluster sample is derived from an optical / near ir survey with the 4shooter ccd camera on the palomar 5 meter telescope .",
    "the survey covers five fields , each of which is approximately one degree square .",
    "the five regions will be denoted as the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 fields .",
    "the palomar distant cluster survey was conducted in two broad band filters , the f555w and f785lp of hst s wide field / planetary camera .",
    "we denote these bands 4 ( f555w ) and i4 ( f785lp ) according to the convention in paper i. the response curves of these filters are shown in fig .  1 of paper i.",
    "the rough transformations to the @xmath0 band and the kron - cousins @xmath31 band are given by    @xmath32    photometric conversions to other standard photometric systems are given in paper i. the zero points of the 4 and i4 magnitudes are based on the ab magnitude system of oke & gunn ( 1983 ) .",
    "the data are complete to roughly @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the isophotal magnitudes .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in the focas photometry are @xmath35 mag for a galaxy with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the zero point fluctuations from field to field are estimated at @xmath38 mag ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "the object detection and classification was performed with a modified version of focas ( jarvis & tyson 1981 ; valdes 1982 ) .",
    "the basic focas object detection , point spread function ( psf ) , measurement , deblending , and star  galaxy ",
    "noise classification algorithms are used .",
    "the 4 and i4 band ccd images are analyzed individually .",
    "the object isophotal detection threshold in each frame is set to be @xmath39 ( typically 25.7 mag per @xmath40 in the 4 band and 24.8 mag per @xmath40 in the i4 band ) , and a minimum object size requirement of 15 pixels ( 1.68 @xmath40 ) is imposed .",
    "the sky background is defined as the mode of values in a given region surrounding the isophotal limits of the galaxy .",
    "because the sky level is lower , and the system response is higher in the 4 band than in the i4 band , the 4 images are deeper .",
    "consequently , about 40% of the objects detected in a typical 4 image are undetected by focas in the corresponding i4 image",
    ". nearly all of these objects are faint ( isophotal magnitude of @xmath41 ) . about 95% of the objects with @xmath42",
    "are detected in both bands .    in the following analysis",
    ", we use those objects which have been classified as galaxies by the focas algorithm in the band where the object is brightest .",
    "the object classification accuracy is discussed extensively in  3.3 of paper i. the classifier breaks down for objects fainter than about 1 magnitude above the completeness limit .",
    "near the limit , the signal - to - noise is low ( @xmath43 ) , and the mean object area is @xmath44 , making reliable classification difficult .",
    "this effect may mean that some distant ellipticals ( those galaxies that we specifically want to examine ) are misclassified as stars .",
    "however , because galaxies outnumber stars by about 7 to 1 at the magnitude limit of the sample , this is not a significant effect ( see figs .",
    "7 & 8 of paper i ) .",
    "in addition , we have confirmed that the results of this paper remain unchanged even if we had included the stars in the color analysis and simply subtracted them through the statistical field subtraction ( see  3 ) .    for the color analysis in this paper ,",
    "we have obtained aperture photometry on all galaxies detected individually in the 4 and i4 bands as described above .",
    "a circular aperture of 5.03 arcsec in radius was used .",
    "this corresponds to a physical size of @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "the aperture magnitude limits are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath49 color is estimated at @xmath50 mag for a galaxy close to our aperture magnitude limits . in the analysis which follows ,",
    "we assume @xmath51 .",
    "a matched filter algorithm was used to objectively identify the cluster candidates by using positional and photometric data simultaneously .",
    "this technique is likely to be more robust than previous optical selections which simply looked for surface density enhancements , a method which can be significantly affected by superposition effects ( e.g.  abell 1958 ; gunn , hoessel & oke 1986 ; couch et al .",
    "an advantage of this technique is that redshift estimates of the cluster candidates are produced as a byproduct of the matched filter ; the main disadvantage is that we must assume a particular form for the cluster luminosity function ( for the flux filter ) and cluster radial profile ( for the radial filter ) .",
    "the radial filter @xmath52 and the flux filter @xmath53 are given by    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath52 is an azimuthally symmetric cluster surface density profile which has a characteristic core radius ( @xmath56 ) and which falls off at large radii as @xmath57 .",
    "the function is explicitly cut off at an arbitrary cutoff radius ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we have chosen @xmath59 and @xmath60 such that the radial profile resembles the profiles of nearby clusters and that we have optimized the cluster detections relative to the spurious detection rates ( paper i ) .",
    "@xmath61 is the background galaxy counts .",
    "@xmath62 is the differential schechter luminosity function with @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the 4 and i4 bands , respectively ; here , we assume the shape of the luminosity function is independent of redshift and adopt a k  correction appropriate for a _ non  evolving elliptical _ galaxy ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for the derivation of these filters and a detailed explanation , see paper i. we have used extensive monte ",
    "carlo simulations in paper i and lubin & postman ( 1996 ; hereafter paper ii ) to quantify the selection function due to the functional form of the matched filter .",
    "we find that the selection bias has a minimal effect on the properties of the observed clusters .",
    "we can detect clusters with a broad range of profile shapes , luminosity function parameters , and color evolution ( paper i ; paper ii ) .",
    "the catalog consists of 79 candidate clusters of galaxies detected with estimated redshifts between @xmath66 .",
    "the estimated redshifts are determined at discrete 0.1 intervals and represent the redshift at which the cluster candidate best matches the filter .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimated redshift ( @xmath67 ) is @xmath68 .",
    "this value is determined from both the simulations and those clusters in the survey which have measured redshifts .",
    "presently , only 10% of the cluster sample have reliably measured redshifts , although they span almost the entire range in redshift , @xmath69 . in all cases ,",
    "the estimated redshifts are within @xmath70 ( see fig .  15 and  4.2.1 of paper i ) .",
    "the redshift survey of the palomar clusters is ongoing , and those interested in its current status should contact the authors .",
    "candidate clusters are detected individually in each band and then matched with the other to locate those systems which are detected in both bands .",
    "87% of the cluster candidates are matched detections ; that is , they have been significantly detected in both the 4 and i4 bands .",
    "the amplitude of the matched filter provides an estimate of the cluster richness .",
    "this filter richness ( @xmath71 ) is a measure of the effective number of @xmath72 galaxies in the cluster ( see  4.2.2 of paper i ; lubin 1995 ) . through monte ",
    "carlo simulations , we can statistically determine the relation between @xmath71 and the actual cluster richness as determined by the specification of abell ( 1958 ) .",
    "this relation is dependent on profile shape ; as the cluster profile slope steepens , a given @xmath71 value corresponds to a _",
    "lower _ richness class . for a cluster which has a surface density profile of approximately @xmath73 ( the average profile of the pdcs clusters ; paper ii )",
    ", @xmath74 corresponds to abell @xmath75 ( paper i ) .",
    "therefore , in the analysis which follows , we will examine only those clusters which have been significantly detected in both bands with @xmath76 in either of the two bands .",
    "this corresponds to a sample of 57 clusters .",
    "we list in table 1 the cluster i d # and the estimated redshift ( @xmath67 ) and filter richness parameter ( @xmath71 ) as determined in the passband where the significance of the detection is highest ( see paper i ) .",

    " day populations of cluster galaxies , we have dimmed appropriately the current epoch data ( see  3.1 ) .      in order to compare our observations with those at zero redshift , we calculate the color evolution of typical nearby galaxies of various morphological type assuming `` no evolution .

    "1 shows the results of these calculations .",
    "the correction to the galaxy color due to the relative change in projected linear size of the photometric aperture is small compared to other uncertainties ( @xmath83 ; sandage & visvanathan 1978 ; silva & elston 1994 ) .    because we are trying to assess the color evolution in the cluster galaxies over a broad range in redshift , we need to quantify our selection biases due to the magnitude limit of our survey .",
    "therefore , we have created a _ no  evolution _",
    "simulation by examining a `` synthetic '' cluster population over our redshift range .",
    "we have constructed this population from cl 0939 + 4713 ( @xmath84 ) which has galaxies with measured colors and morphological classifications from hst ( dressler et al .",
    "dressler et al .  ( 1994 ) found that this cluster exhibited a blue fraction consistent with that expected from the butcher  oemler effect .",
    "the colors of the cluster galaxies suggest that most of them are normal examples of their hubble type , and their luminosity functions are consistent with that of present  day cluster galaxies .",

    "we have chosen the redshifts @xmath87 because they are roughly the medians of the 3 estimated redshift intervals being studied here . when calculating the aperture magnitude ( @xmath88 ) at these redshifts , we have taken into account the change in projected linear size of the photometric aperture with redshift",
    "; however , we have not corrected the @xmath89 colors for the effect of a color gradient as the correction is small ( see sandage & visvanathan 1978 ; silva & elston 1994 ) .",
    "the e / s0s ( filled circles ) appear on a distinct locus in each of these diagrams .",
    "2 also shows the total color distribution ( solid line histogram ) and the distribution that we would be observed given the magnitude limits of our survey ( shaded histogram ) . in order to compare the actual data with these evolutionary predictions , we need a quantitative description of these color distributions .",
    "we would like an estimator of the mean color ( presumably that of the early  type population ) which is not severely affected by the presence of a blue tail .",
    "we follow the approach used in a93 and adopt the biweight location ( @xmath90 ) and scale ( @xmath91 ) estimators ( beers , flynn & gebhardt 1990 and references therein ) .",
    "these estimators are well - suited to non - gaussian distributions . for a gaussian distribution",
    ", @xmath90 is better than 80% efficient at accurately determining the mean with more than 10 points , while @xmath91 asymptotically approaches the standard deviation ( see beers et al.1990 for exact details ) . in order to gauge the @xmath92 errors on these parameters , we have used a bootstrap analysis .",
    "this technique involves randomly drawing many new samples ( of equal number ) from the original sample of galaxy colors .",
    "the standard deviations of the resulting parameter distributions are defined as the @xmath93 parameter errors .",
    "table 3 lists these parameters for the total and observed color distributions of the simulated cluster populations .",
    "the more conventional descriptors , the median and interquartile range , give results which are similar to those of the biweight location and scale estimators .    fig .",
    "2 shows that , at @xmath94 , the simulated color distributions are unaffected by the magnitude limit of the survey . at @xmath95 ,",
    "the e / s0 population still appears as a clear peak in the color distribution ( 4  i4 @xmath96 ) , even though a large portion of the cluster population extends beyond the magnitude limits of the survey . at @xmath22 , the observed color distribution ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "2 ) is significantly altered , though it would still be possible to detect the brightest cluster ellipticals at @xmath97 with a predicted color of @xmath98 .",
    "the mean color in this redshift interval is @xmath99 .",
    "note that the differential k - correction ( fig .",
    "1 ) causes a distinct change in the relative number of e / s0s versus spirals observed in the different redshift bins .",
    "for the chosen synthetic cluster population , the ratio of e / s0s to spirals is @xmath100 ; this ratio is preserved in the observed color distribution of a cluster at @xmath101 but becomes @xmath102 for a cluster at @xmath22 .    for the analysis of the pdcs clusters , we study _ composite",
    "_ color distributions ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "since we co - add clusters over a broad range in redshifts , this will artificially increase the dispersion around the elliptical color  magnitude relation , as well as the width of the color distribution in general .",
    "for example , from @xmath103 the no  evolution elliptical color changes by @xmath104 0.6 mag ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we simulate this effect by generating the synthetic cluster population of fig .  2 at random redshifts between @xmath105 .",
    "we then create composite color diagrams for each redshift interval such that we have roughly the same number of galaxies as observed in the pdcs composites ( see fig .",

    "secondly , as we only have estimated redshifts for most of the cluster sample , there is the possibility that some of these high  redshift clusters are actually superpositions of poor groups or clusters along the line - of - sight .",
    "since there are only 5 clusters in the highest redshift bin ( table 2 ) , a misclassification of a few of these cluster candidates would make the resulting color distribution significantly bluer .",
    "because of this possibility and the substantial threat of contamination at these redshifts , we have used the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to confirm that the two high - redshift samples are not consistent with being drawn from the field population .",
    "the probability that the two color distributions are drawn from the field population is less than 0.002% .",
    "in addition , we have explored a different approach in defining the samples in the two highest redshift bins .",
    "we have imposed different magnitude limits such that we are complete for the likely @xmath128 colors of the early - type cluster population .",
    "these limits are @xmath129 in the @xmath119 redshift interval and @xmath130 in the @xmath131 redshift interval . for",
    "a cluster at @xmath22 , the new @xmath88 magnitude limit should greatly improve the accurate identification of the red cluster members ( bottom left panel of fig.2 ) . from the new samples , we have created composite color distributions in the same manner as described above .",
    "the biweight location and scale estimators for the resulting color distributions are @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the mean colors are reasonably consistent within the measurement uncertainty with the results of the original analysis ; however , they are slightly redder as expected if this technique improves our identification of the red cluster galaxies . still , the mean colors are bluer than the no  evolution predictions of the synthetic cluster populations by @xmath137 mag at @xmath138 and @xmath139 mag at @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the estimated redshift distribution of the palomar clusters is examined in paper i. this distribution is consistent with the hypothesis that the typical , bright distant cluster galaxy is _ bluer _ than a non  evolving elliptical at the cluster redshift .",
    "this further supports the results of the color analysis presented here .",
    "the observed blueing trend in the palomar clusters has also been observed by rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) in the rest - frame strmgren @xmath140 filters and by a93 in the optical  infrared colors .",
    "a93 examined 10 rich clusters at @xmath19 and found that the red envelope is bluer than present  day ellipticals by approximately 0.4 , 0.5 , and 1.3 mag in @xmath141 at the mean redshifts of @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "based on the simple bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) evolutionary models presented in  3.3 , the observed @xmath141 color differences would imply a color shift ( relative to the no - evolution prediction ) in the @xmath82 color of roughly @xmath143 and @xmath144 at @xmath95 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "these predictions are consistent within the photometric and measurement errors with the observed color evolution in the palomar clusters .",
    "aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , dickinson ( 1995 ) , and rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) have all noted that the observed evolutionary trend in clusters at @xmath146 is consistent with simple passive evolution of an old stellar population which was originally formed in a single burst of star - formation at an epoch of @xmath6 ( see also bower et al .  1992a , b ; charlot & silk 1994 ; pehre et al .",
    "1995 ; ellis et al .",
    "we examine these conclusions by comparing the results of our color analysis to the population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( e.g.  bruzual 1983 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 , 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the free parameters in these models are the initial mass function ( imf ) and the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "we choose the traditional scalo ( 1986 ) imf with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 125 @xmath147 , respectively . for the sfr",
    ", we explore two possible rates : ( 1 ) a burst of constant star formation for a initial period @xmath148 ( @xmath149model ; bruzual 1983 ) ; and ( 2 ) an exponentially decaying sfr such that a fraction @xmath150 of the galaxy mass is converted into stars after the first gyr ( @xmath151model ; bruzual 1983 ) .",
    "the evolutionary calculations have been made using the bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) synthesis code .",
    "the age of the galaxy is determined by the redshift ( @xmath152 ) at which the epoch of star formation began .",
    "we relate look - back time to redshift using @xmath153 and @xmath154 .    in fig .  8",
    ", we show the results for two models with ( 1 ) @xmath155 and ( 2 ) @xmath156 for three formation epochs of @xmath157 . given the large redshift uncertainty ,",
    "the color evolution in the palomar clusters is consistent with passive evolution of a single burst of star formation at @xmath158 .",
    "both models provide a reasonable fit to the color evolution at @xmath159 , implying formation epochs of @xmath160 .",
    "previous observations of distant clusters in the optical  infrared colors indicate similar formation epochs ( a93 ; dickinson 1995 ; rakos & schombert 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath151model provides a better fit to the data in the highest redshift bin as more evolution is predicted at @xmath22 . as noted in  3.2 , since optical passbands at high - redshift sample the rest - frame uv light which is most affected by recent bursts of star formation , the color distribution in the highest redshift bin will be biased toward late - type cluster galaxies .",
    "therefore , the characteristic ( or mean ) color of this distribution may not accurately represent the early - type cluster population but may actually be _ bluer_. this would , of course , affect how well a particular model fits the optical colors . in light of this , we have examined a combination of evolutionary models representing a mix of early and late  type galaxies , i.e.  the @xmath161 model for the ellipticals and a constant sfr model for the spirals ( see bruzual & charlot 1996 ) .",
    "mixed models with a cluster population of @xmath162 spirals match well the color in the highest redshift bin .",
    "these models are also consistent with formation epochs of @xmath163 for the early  type population .",
    "observations in the infrared bands are more indicative of a long - lived stellar population and are thereby more suited to examining the red , `` passive '' early - type population .",
    "a deep optical  infrared survey of the palomar clusters at @xmath164 is presently underway ( lubin et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "regardless of the specific forms of the evolutionary models , we have shown in  3.2 that our data are inconsistent with a non - evolving population of early - type galaxies . in comparison with the simple passive evolution models presented here",
    ", the observed evolution at @xmath165 suggests that these galaxies formed at redshifts of @xmath166 , consistent with previous observations of distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "this result is supported by direct observations of very high  redshift ( @xmath167 ) star - forming galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we would also like to examine the radial dependence on the cluster color distribution . in order to improve our cluster signal - to - noise at large radii from the cluster center ,",
    "we examine an even richer subset of pdcs clusters ; that is , we include only those clusters with a filter richness measure @xmath168 in either of the 4 or i4 bands ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a sample of 10 , 14 , and 5 clusters in each of the three redshift intervals . in fig .  9 , we present the background - corrected composite color distributions as a function of three radial zones : ( 1 ) @xmath169 , ( 2 ) @xmath170 , and ( 3 ) @xmath171 .",
    "table 6 lists the biweight location and scale estimators for these distributions .",
    "there is no obvious trend in the data , except perhaps in the intermediate redshift interval of @xmath172 . here",
    "the mean color , as defined by the biweight location estimator , gets slightly bluer as a function of radial position .",
    "a strong blueing trend with distance from the cluster center has been previously observed by bo in intermediate redshift ( @xmath173 ) clusters .",
    "in addition , one might expect the dispersion , as characterized by the biweight scale estimator , to increase with radius as the tight color ",
    "magnitude relation for early  type galaxies is characteristic of the cluster cores .",
    "this is not clearly observed in the pdcs clusters .",
    "we note that at large radii the variance may increase and the color may become artificially bluer if we have not accurately removed the contribution of the mostly late  type background population .",
    "butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) have systematically studied 33 clusters of galaxies with redshifts between 0.003 and 0.54 to examine the evolution of the colors of the cluster populations .",
    "they found that the `` fraction of blue galaxies '' ( @xmath8 ) increases with redshift for both open and compact clusters .",
    "bo defined @xmath8 as follows ; they examined only those galaxies which are brighter than @xmath174 and within a circular area containing the inner 30% of the total cluster population ( as characterized by the radius @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the radius containing n% of the cluster s projected galaxy distribution within @xmath177 ) .",
    "@xmath8 is then defined as the fraction of galaxies whose _ rest  frame _ @xmath111 colors are at least 0.2 mag bluer than the ridge line of the early  type galaxies at that magnitude .",
    "the blue fraction is also dependent on the degree of central concentration ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ; bo ) .",
