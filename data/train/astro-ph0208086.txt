    "the composition of the jets observed in galactic x - ray transients , either electron - positron or electron - proton plasma , is still not fully established .",
    "here we review the arguments presented in @xcite where we proposed that the annihilation line features observed in the hard x - ray spectra of some x - ray transients arise from pairs in a bipolar outflow . at the time of annihilation , this outflow is already accelerated to relativistic bulk speeds causing a significant doppler shift of the frequency of the annihilation lines .",
    "we also showed that the subsequent emission of radio synchrotron radiation from the outflow may be caused by only a small fraction of pairs escaping from the annihilation region .",
    "we apply this idea to radio and hard x - ray observations of nova muscae 1991 .",
    "the energy requirements for this source rule out a large contribution of protons to the outflow .",
    "_ conditions for a strong , narrow annihilation line . _ the direct annihilation of an electron - positron pair results in the production of two @xmath2-ray photons , each with an energy of 511kev in the rest - frame of the annihilating particles . in non - thermal plasmas",
    "relativistic electrons or pairs may be injected into the plasma .",
    "the injected pairs and those produced in the plasma may cool to sub - relativistic energies and thermalize before annihilating , thus leading to a narrow annihilation line @xcite . if the line is strong , it can rise above the comptonization spectrum and becomes detectable .",
    "this requires a high pair yield , @xmath3 , defined as the ratio of the energy converted to pairs and the energy supplied to the plasma .",
    "the highest pair yields can be achieved when the plasma is ` photon - starved ' , i.e. when the number of injected relativistic photons strongly exceeds that of the injected soft photons @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath4 and a strong , narrow annihilation line above the comptonization continuum becomes observable .",
    "the observation of a narrow annihilation line most likely indicates a plasma with strong injection of non - thermal electrons or pairs .",
    "the injection of leptons into a spherical volume of radius @xmath5 is characterised by the compactness ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath8 is the power of the electron injection , @xmath9 . here",
    ", @xmath10 is the rate of injection of leptons with lorentz factor @xmath2 per unit volume per unit time per unit @xmath2 .",
    "if the compactness @xmath11 can be inferred from the observations of an annihilation line , then the above equations can be used to constrain @xmath10 .",
    "+ _ relativistic doppler - shifts . _",
    "any emission of relativistically moving material is doppler - shifted in its frequency . for material moving with bulk velocity @xmath12 at an angle @xmath13 to the line of sight to the observer , the observed frequency , @xmath14 , of radiation emitted at frequency @xmath15 in the rest - frame of the material is given as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the lorentz factor corresponding to the velocity @xmath18 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the upper signs correspond to material receding along the line of sight to the observer while the lower signs indicate approaching material . from equation ( [ delta ] ) it is clear that radiation of material receding from an observer is always redshifted .",
    "however , for approaching material the emission may be blueshifted or redshifted , depending on the combination of @xmath18 and @xmath13 . solving equation ( [ delta ] ) for @xmath18",
    "we find that for @xmath19 the annihilation line arising from the approaching jet material will be redshifted .",
    "the range of velocities which result in such a doppler redshift is largest for angles to the line of sight close to @xmath20 .",
    "nova muscae ( grs 1124@xmath21684 ) was discovered on 1991  jan  8 by granat ( @xcite , @xcite ) and ginga @xcite . during monitoring observations ,",
    "a strong , narrow line near 500 kev was detected on jan  2021 which had not been noted before .",
    "the line flux was observed to increase during the observation within the space of a few hours .",
    "unfortunately , the observations stopped before the line flux decreased again , implying a lifetime of the line emission of at least 10 hours . simultaneously to the strong line near 500 kev , there was also increased emission detected near 200 kev . the spectrum obtained with granat during 1991  jan  2021",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the original discovery also triggered a radio monitoring programme using the molongolo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 843mhz ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite note four distinct features in the lightcurve .",
    "there is a general decay of the radio flux from the very beginning of the programme continuing until about january  22 .",
    "there is another flare observed from january  31 until around february  5 .",
    "finally , a short flare lasting only one day was observed by most at 843mhz on january  24 with a measured flux density of 24mjy . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the detection of the @xmath2-ray lines on january  21 and the brief radio flare on january  24 .",
    "we speculate that the same ejection event is responsible for the emission at opposite ends of the electromagnetic spectrum observed on the two days .",
    "+ _ constraints from the annihilation line .",
    "_ we assume here that the two @xmath2-ray lines observed in the spectrum of nova muscae arise from pair annihilation in a relativistic bipolar outflow from the very centre of the system . in this model ,",
    "the line at 474kev is associated with the approaching component while that at 194kev arises from the receding component .",
    "we find @xmath22 for the angle to the line of sight of the component motion and @xmath23 for the bulk velocity of the components .",
    "this corresponds to a lorentz factor of @xmath24 .",
    "+ the rate of annihilation implied by the line flux ( @xmath25photons s@xmath1 @xmath26 ) is @xmath27pairs s@xmath1 for a distance of 5.5kpc @xcite .",
    "this enormous rate is sustained for at least 10 hours @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that this feature at 474  kev arises from a large number of pairs formed practically instantaneously and then slowly annihilating away .",
    "this would imply a short - lived flash of annihilation photons with a fast , exponential decay contrary to the lifetime of the annihilation features of at least 10 hours .",
    "a more promising approach is to assume that the pair producing plasma is in equilibrium , i.e. the annihilation losses are balanced by pair creation .",
    "we fit the spectrum using the model nteea within the xspec package which is an implementation of the model developed in @xcite .",
    "the only free parameters in this fit were the compactness of the non - thermal electron injection , @xmath11 , and the compactness of injected soft photons , @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows our best fit with a reduced @xmath29-value of 1.35 ( for 84  d.o.f ) .",
    "the free parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , imply a strongly photon - starved plasma .",
    "however , the values of the model parameters are not well - constrained and reasonable fits to the data can be obtained for @xmath32 .",
    "re - arranging the equation above yields @xmath33 . substituting in our lower limits for @xmath5 and @xmath11 , we find @xmath34w .",
    "it follows that @xmath35m@xmath36 s@xmath1 for this lower limit .",
    "the rate at which relativistic electrons are injected is then @xmath37particles s@xmath1 .",
    "this is comparable to the observed annihilation rate of @xmath38particles s@xmath1 .",
    "+ _ implications of a bipolar flow . _ in the case of an ejection event shorter than 10 hours , the annihilation rate would decrease dramatically as the ejected material travels outwards and expands . in the model presented here",
    "we argue that the bulk of the outflow containing the pairs is already accelerated when they annihilate , thus explaining the redshifts of the two observed lines .",
    "the velocity of the outflow is then 0.84c .",
    "the energy required to drive the outflows is enormous .",
    "as the relativistic electrons necessary for pair production are highly relativistic , their mass in the rest frame of the outflow material is given by @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the total kinetic power of the relativistic electrons , as measured in the source rest frame , injected into the outflow can be approximated as @xmath40 . in this estimate",
    "we have used the limiting values for the electron compactness , @xmath41 , and the size of the emission region , @xmath42 m . any increase in these parameters",
    "will also cause the energy estimate to rise .",
    "therefore , the lower limit on @xmath43 corresponds already to about 80% of the eddington luminosity of a 6m@xmath44 black hole .",
    "balance of electrical charge requires the presence of positively charged particles in the outflow .",
    "if these are protons with negligible thermal energy but travelling at the necessary bulk velocity , then another @xmath45w in kinetic energy are required .",
    "this is at least a factor 50 more than the eddington luminosity .",
    "this energy injection into the outflow has to be sustained for more than 10 hours and thus makes a large proton content in the jet very unlikely .",
    "the only alternative is then that from the very beginning of the ejection the outflow material in the annihilation region consists of virtually a pure pair plasma .",
    "this removes the requirement of relatively inefficient pair production from relativistic electrons .",
    "the pairs must be injected into the relativistic bulk flow with a relativistic velocity distribution to explain the strength of the annihilation line @xcite , the cooling within the outflow and then annihilation at a rate of @xmath46s@xmath1 . in this case , the required kinetic power is about @xmath47w , or 8% of the eddington luminosity .",
