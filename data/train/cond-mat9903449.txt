    "<S> the more pronounced decrease of the spin - stiffness for sr@xmath0 doping should be associated with the mobile nature of the holes which induce a larger damping in the spin excitations @xcite . on the other hand </S>",

    "<S> one would conclude that la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 remains in the rc regime with a spin - stiffness constant reduced with respect to the pure la@xmath13cuo@xmath4 , up to the limit where the correlation length is smaller than the average distance @xmath86 between stripes .    </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) with @xmath92 k. the @xmath39 dependence of the correlation length for @xmath93 yields information on the topology of the holes . </S>",
    "<S> if the holes are localized close to the randomly distributed sr@xmath0 impurity ions , one expects @xmath94 @xcite . on the other hand , if the correlation length is limited by the formation of domain walls where the mobile holes are segregated , then @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the average distance between the holes along the domain walls in lattice units @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although it is difficult to distinguish the @xmath39 dependence of the form @xmath97 from the @xmath98 one , it should be noticed that the estimated values of @xmath99 do confirm the microsegregation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the assumption of a random distribution of holes would imply values for @xmath99 much smaller than the ones experimentally measured . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath100 one should have @xmath101 , while the experimental value is @xmath102 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . on the contrary , in the presence of stripes , with @xmath103 ( as found by tranquada et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the @xmath104 compound ) , one obtains @xmath105 , in close agreement with the experimental finding .    </S>",
    "<S> also these estimates appear to reinforce the idea that the holes segregate along domain walls , or stripes . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of the stripes was originally proposed in order to justify the susceptibility @xcite and the @xmath39 dependence of the sublattice magnetization @xmath106 in the limit @xmath93 , as derived from @xmath23la nqr and @xmath24sr measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative description of the effective spin stiffness @xmath9 resulting from the presence of the stripes below @xmath15 has been given by castro neto and hone @xcite and more recently by van duin and zaanen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these descriptions are based on the quantum non - linear @xmath107 model and assume an in - plane anisotropy for the superexchange constant @xmath22 in an effective heisenberg hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> in this framework , for @xmath93 a pronounced decrease of the spin stiffness with @xmath39 justifies the experimental behavior for @xmath106 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to compare the @xmath108dependence of @xmath9 derived in the high temperature range from @xmath6cu nqr @xmath7 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) with the behavior for @xmath9 expected at low temperature on the basis of the picture by castro neto and hone @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 the solid line shows the @xmath108dependence of the spin stiffness according to eq . 7 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 21 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the data for @xmath9 derived from @xmath6cu nqr @xmath7 shows that the decrease of @xmath9 from @xmath7 is much smaller than the one derived from the staggered magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is related to the different temperature regions probed by the two quantities , implying that two different regimes are present in the spin dynamics . at high temperature , where @xmath109 , the stripes are mobile , possibly corresponding to anti - phase boundaries @xcite and the spin excitations are the ones characteristic of the 2dqhaf with a reduced number of holes . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , @xmath9 is only slightly reduced by doping . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic fluctuation time for the stripes is much longer than @xmath110 and in the life time of the spin excitations the stripes appear as nearly static . on the contrary , in the low temperature regime , where @xmath111 , the stripes reduce the effective superexchange coupling perpendicular to the domain walls and cause the pronounced decrease of the spin - stiffness constant . </S>",
    "<S> since no narrowing in the @xmath23la nqr spectra has been observed @xcite , one can conclude that the hopping rate for the stripes should be lower than @xmath112 khz , for @xmath12 . in between these two regimes @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> is of the order of @xmath86 and one observes a progressive saturation of @xmath26 on decreasing temperature ( corresponding to a reduction of @xmath16 ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6cu nqr @xmath87 measurements in lightly doped la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 evidence that the spin - stiffness constant at high temperatures is reduced by doping only to a small extent , consistent with the idea of formation of stripes . on decreasing temperature a progressive saturation for the in - plane correlation length </S>",
    "<S> is found , with a concomitant decrease in the spin - stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath16 and the analysis of the correlation length @xmath8 support the hypothesis of microsegregation of the holes along stripes . </S>"
