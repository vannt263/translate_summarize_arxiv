    "in the current age of precision cosmology , the fundamental parameters of the favored cosmological model can be measured with high accuracy .",
    "strong and weak gravitational lensing studies are particularly important in this endeavor as an independent and relatively assumption - free measure of mass morphology in clusters of galaxies .",
    "conventional gravitational lensing studies continue to utilize the standard assumption of thin lenses .",
    "this allows for the actual path of photons from source to observer to be approximated by its asymptotics , with a sharp bending at the plane where the lens is located .",
    "there is , clearly , some error involved in this approximation , but the size of this error has not been rigorously examined , to our knowledge .",
    "a question that will be important as the accuracy increases is at what point the error in the conventional approach becomes comparable to the uncertainty in the cosmological parameters .",
    "at that point , accurate modeling of lensing events will require a more accurate version of the lens equation , or an efficient algorithm to calculate the photon paths . in this respect , seminal proposals that improve on the conventional approach",
    "exist , dating from the 1990 s . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "higher - order lens equations in cosmological backgrounds are developed .",
    "a different style of approximation which correctly utilizes the thin - lens paths as the zeroth - order path is introduced in @xcite .",
    "the same motivation sparked some interest in revisiting the foundations of gravitational lensing theory with the aim of developing the concept of the lens equation without reference to a lens plane , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these works develop a consistent theory of strong lensing entirely on the basis of the null geodesics in an arbitrary spacetime .",
    "image distortion and weak gravitational lensing were considered from this perspective in @xcite .",
    "an application of this no - lens - plane approach in ( non - cosmological ) spacetimes representing spherically symmetric non - singular matter distributions is presented in @xcite . the case of schwarzschild black holes is developed in @xcite and the resulting lensing predictions are compared to @xcite , where a lens - plane approximation is applied to lightrays that undergo large bending .",
    "large bending angles by static and spinning black holes are also treated with an approximation scheme in @xcite , with an application to sag a@xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to test the accuracy of the conventional approach in determining the total mass of clusters . for this purpose",
    "we integrate the null geodesic equations in cosmological lensing spacetimes .",
    "we work with actual or realistic strong - lensing scenarios in the standard cosmology , assuming matter distributions of either a three - dimensional singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model or the model of @xcite ( nfw ) .",
    "both these models are unrealistic to the extent that the mass density does not fall off fast enough to allow for a bounded mass in all space . in principle , some way of truncating the mass density is implicit in the model , although the details of the truncation mechanism are not considered of fundamental relevance to the predicted observables .    often in the application of gravitational lensing to astrophysical data , truncation is imposed only in the directions transverse to the line of sight .",
    "this practice is justified on the basis that the projected mass density required for the thin - lens approximation is actually well defined in the model , as it involves only a one dimensional integration of the mass density along the line of sight , and therefore , truncation of the model along the line of sight is not necessary .",
    "naturally , this practice introduces further error in addition to the error involved in the use of the thin - lens assumption .",
    "the accuracy of this conventional model ( thin - lens plus lack of truncation along the line of sight ) is the issue in our current study .",
    "our method consists of comparing the observables predicted by the conventional approach to those predicted by the theory with no approximations .",
    "the theory is provided by the bending of light in the presence of mass as described by general relativity .",
    "the physical scenario common to both problems is the mass - density model .",
    "this is used differently in both approaches . in the conventional approach",
    ", the mass density is only used after integration along the line of sight , with no truncation . in the relativistic approach , which here we consider to be the exact treatment of the problem , the mass density is used as a source of the newtonian potential that determines the components of the metric whose null geodesics are sought in exact form",
    "the general relativistic ( or exact ) approach does not make sense in the absence of truncation along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , our study ends up comparing the results of a non - truncated thin - lens model to a properly truncated general - relativistic numerical integration , both of which represent the same physical situation . for a proper interpretation of our results ,",
    "it is important to emphasize that the non - truncated thin - lens models are conventionally intended to represent , with some accuracy , the physical situation of a properly truncated mass density , and for this reason the comparison is entirely justified .",
    "clearly , however , the comparison of the conventional approach with the relativistic treatment provides a measure of the total error incurred by two separate mechanisms : the thin lens approximation , and the lack of proper truncation along the line of sight .",
    "the error introduced by the truncation mechanism , or the lack of it , into the thin - lens scheme can be analyzed as an end in itself . in this respect ,",
    "progress has been made recently in introducing better physical truncation schemes that improve over hard truncation , including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of importance , @xcite considers differences between truncated and non - truncated lensing observables , giving a measure of the inaccuracy introduced by the truncation mechanism into the thin - lens scheme .",
    "these studies take the properly truncated thin - lens scheme as the exact model of the physical situation , thus they fail to properly account for the actual inaccuracy with respect to the general relativistic theory .",
    "the size of the truncation error by itself within the thin - lens scheme has little meaning if the actual error introduced by the thin - lens assumption is not known .    in order to give an idea of the sizes of both errors ( thin - lens and lack of truncation ) with respect to the relativistic theory",
    ", we also compare our integration of the null geodesics with thin - lens models truncated along the line of sight . in this case , the inaccuracy of the model is entirely due to a single assumption : that of thin lenses .",
    "our mechanism of truncation is as simple as possible : a hard cut off of the mass density after an arbitrarily chosen radius .    in section",
    "[ back : sec ] , we outline the ways the robertson - walker ( rw ) background geometry enters our calculation , and in section  [ eqns : sec ] , we outline the equations of motion .",

    "we take as the background a flat rw metric with the current accepted values of the hubble constant @xmath3  km / s / mpc , the matter density @xmath4 and the cosmological constant density @xmath5 .",
    "the metric is    @xmath6    with a scale factor @xmath7 for our cosmological model as in @xcite    @xmath8    the hubble parameter @xmath9 is    @xmath10    we will be considering photons emitted by a source at emission time @xmath11 , and arriving at the observer at the observation time @xmath12 . for numerical convenience ,",
    "we fix the scale factor to the value 1 at the observation time , @xmath13 , which yields @xmath14 .",
    "a natural way to give the relative locations between the lens , observer , and source is to place the lens at the spatial origin , and to use the redshifts to determine the positioning of the lens and observer . using the redshift relation , @xmath15 and setting @xmath16",
    ", we can solve for the value of @xmath11 with eq .",
    "[ a1 ] .    to obtain the radial positions of the source and observer",
    ", we orient our coordinates in such a way that a light ray travels radially in the background spacetime and assume that the observer , lens and source are at least nearly co - linear",
    ". we can then integrate radial null geodesics of the metric eq .",
    "[ frw1 ] to determine the radial positions of the source and observer ( by ignoring the perturbation introduced by the lens ) .",
    "the lensing scenario is described in terms of the following weakly perturbed rw metric    @xmath17    this metric is accurate to first order in @xmath18 , which is a newtonian potential determined by the proper mass density of the lens @xmath19 via    @xmath20    where the derivatives in the laplacian operator are taken with respect to the proper distance @xmath21 .",
    "commonly , the proper mass density is taken as a function @xmath22 which depends explicitly on the proper distance @xmath23 but not on the time @xmath24 .    under conventional lensing conditions , a lightray spends a very small amount of time in the area of influence of the lens ( where @xmath25 ) . during such a small time the scale factor of the universe @xmath7 changes very little .",
    "it is typically assumed that under such conditions , this scenario is consistent with the einstein equations for a linearized perturbation off a frw spacetime .",
    "the consistency of a general cosmological lensing scenario with the einstein equations is studied in @xcite .    by eq .",
    "[ poisson ] , the potential @xmath18 is an explicit function of the proper distance @xmath23 but not the time @xmath24 . necessarily ,",
    "thus , the potential is a function of both the comoving distance @xmath26 and the coordinate time @xmath24 via :    @xmath27    consequently , the metric , eq .  [ m1 ] , is not strictly static in the comoving coordinate system .",
    "this issue is somewhat obscure in the standard references , including the excellent books by @xcite and @xcite , where the potential is said to be `` time independent . ''",
    "the time - variation of the potential is small , however , in the conditions of lensing , where the scale factor changes very little during the passage of a lightray ( one has @xmath28 ) .",
    "so during the passage through the lens one may approximate the scale factor by its value at some time @xmath29 representative of the time at which the lightray passes the lens .",
    "this would make the metric around the lens approximately static for the purposes of calculating , for instance , the time delay due to the lens .    for our purposes the metric",
    "is needed for the entire trajectory from the source to the lens , along which one expects the scale factor to change perhaps significantly .",
    "the metric is not , thus , independent of time , but it is conformal to an approximately time - independent metric .",
    "since the null geodesics of conformally related spacetimes are identical , we may choose to approximate the scale factor with its value at the lens or not .",
    "although the approximation is very valuable for the purpose of obtaining a closed form expression for the lens equation in the conventional approach , it brings no real advantage to the numerical integration of the null geodesics , so we prefer to maintain the time dependence as prescribed by poisson s equation .",
    "the equations of motion are more complicated ( in particular , they do not decouple ) but the added complications do not represent a real obstacle .    since the lens model eq .  [ m1 ] is spherically symmetric , the particle trajectories are planar , and there is no loss of generality in choosing the plane as @xmath30 .",
    "the geodesic equations can be found explicitly as the euler - lagrange equations of the lagrangian    @xmath31    to first order in @xmath18 .",
    "the lagrangian is equal to zero because the geodesics are null .    since the coordinate @xmath32 is cyclic , the euler - lagrange equations are equivalent to five first - order odes , which we can write as    @xmath33",
    "these equations are obtained by working to first order in @xmath18 and making use of @xmath34 in the form    @xmath35    the parameter @xmath36 arises from @xmath37 and is related to the `` observation angle '' at the observer or the angle between the lightray and the optical ( radial ) axis connecting the observer to the lens .",
    "the relationship is determined by taking the dot product of the spatial part of the null vector at the observer with a unit vector pointing towards the origin .",
    "using the spatial part of the metric , eq .",
    "[ m1 ] , one obtains    @xmath38    where the potential , @xmath39 , is evaluated at the observer position at @xmath40 .    we will be integrating past null geodesics from the observer back to hypothetical sources .",
    "therefore , we need to specify five constants of integration :    @xmath41    this is in addition to the constant @xmath36 which essentially fixes the initial value of @xmath42 . for the initial position @xmath43 we take @xmath44 by setting the unit scale to the age of the universe , @xmath45 by arbitrary choice , and set @xmath46 using the redshift of the lens ( which is placed at the origin ) , as was described in section  [ back : sec ] .",
    "the initial value of @xmath47 is set to @xmath48 , and then by @xmath49 , we determine the initial value of @xmath50 .",
    "note that by choice of units , we have @xmath51 . from eq .",
    "[ r1 ] and [ odes ] , we have    @xmath52    where @xmath53 , and we take the overall minus sign to make the rays approach the lens .",
    "the sis and nfw matter distributions are simple spherically - symmetric matter models in common use in lensing and other studies .",
    "an inconvenience of both these models is that the total mass is unbounded . in this section ,",
    "we develop the three - dimensional gravitational potentials for these models assuming that the matter extends to some proper radius @xmath54 with zero matter density for @xmath55 .",
    "we also develop two - dimensional ( projected ) thin - lens matter distributions for each model with and without truncation for @xmath55 .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model is appealing because it predicts flat rotation curves . in the sis model",
    "the mass enclosed in a sphere of proper radius @xmath23 is    @xmath56    where the parameter @xmath57 is the velocity dispersion , independent of the cluster redshift . for @xmath58 where @xmath54 is some truncation radius to be determined ,",

    "thus for @xmath55 the potential is that of a point mass enclosing a mass @xmath61 .",

    "since we are primarily interested in the error introduced in the thin - lens approximation in predicting the mass of the cluster , we cite the relative error in the square of the velocity dispersion ,    @xmath159    for sis models , and the relative error in @xmath99 ,    @xmath160    for nfw models .",
    "the sis error is equal to the fractional error in the predicted mass .",

    ", we consider a lens and source for rxj1347 - 1145 ( source at @xmath155 ) and rdcs1252.9 - 2927 , where we assume a source is located at @xmath161 on the optical axis , and compute the velocity dispersion for a given observed einstein ring angle using the non - perturbative method and the two thin lens methods .",
    "figure [ vtheta35:fig ] shows the relative error in the square of the velocity dispersion as a function of the observed einstein ring angle for a cutoff radius of 3.5 mpc .",
    "we see that the errors tend to approach @xmath162 for physical values for the conventional one - parameter sis thin - lens .",
    "the truncated sis thin lens models tend to perform better , with approximately one fourth the fractional error in the total cluster mass .",

    "here we assume that @xmath140  mpc when the light ray passes the lens , which is the best fit scale radius for rxj1347 - 1145 for weak lensing analysis from @xcite .",
    "we see that the error is on the same order of magnitude as the error in the sis mass prediction for arcs at large observation angles . for small observation angles",
    ", there is a significant difference between the values for @xmath99 predicted by the non - perturbative and thin lens models , but these observation angles are unlikely , because they involve low concentration parameters ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "the truncated thin - lens nfw models again perform better for physical systems than the conventional thin - lens models , but the error remains on the same order of magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ vrcwith : fig ] , we show how the relative error in the square of the velocity dispersion depends on the cutoff radius for conventional and truncated sis models , respectively . here",
    ", we consider rxj1347 - 1145 , and the three curves represent einstein rings observed at 5 , 15 , and 35 arc sec .",
    "we see that the relative error introduced by using a thin - lens model does depend on the choice of truncation radius and does not go to zero with larger radius .    for nfw models , variation in @xmath104 at the time the light ray passes",
    "the lens leads to minor changes in the value of @xmath99 , but not significant changes in the error estimates .",
    "for example , weak lensing measurements found the best fit parameters for rxj1347 - 1145 to be @xmath164  mpc @xcite . for the physical arcs in this system at 35 arc sec ,",
    "table  [ nfw_r200:table ] indicates that the fractional errors maintain the same order of magnitude as @xmath104 is varied .",
    "table [ sis_35:table ] gives the relative error in mass ( or square velocity dispersion ) for thin - lens sis models for four possible scenarios at increasing lens redshift , all with truncation radii of 3.5 mpc . in all four cases the lens and the source are at fixed resfhit , and the einstein ring angle",
    "is varied .",
    "a number of observations can be made .",
    "first , the error in the prediction of the mass incurred by the use of the thin lens approximation alone varies between @xmath165 for small rings and @xmath0 for large rings .",
    "secondly , the error in the mass incurred by the combination of the thin lens approximation and the removal of truncation varies between @xmath166 for small rings and @xmath1 for large rings .",
    "subtracting both errors yields an estimate of the error introduced by the removal of truncation in the thin lens model .",
    "one can see that the removal of truncation along the line of sight introduces an error between 5 and 12 times as large as the thin lens assumption does , for small and large rings respectively .",
    "similarly , table [ nfw_35:table ] gives the relative error in @xmath99 for nfw models where the truncation radius is set to @xmath167  mpc when the light ray passes the lens .",
    "the scenarios are the same as for table [ sis_35:table ] .",
    "one can see that the thin lens approximation alone introduces and error in @xmath99 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in cases of lens redshift less than 1 .",
    "perhaps unexpectedly , the conventional approach shows a relative error around @xmath162 to @xmath1 due to the combination of the thin lens assumption and removal of truncation .",
    "the truncation alone introduces an error between between 1 and 5 times that incurred by the thin lens assumption .",
    "for a given lens and source distance , and a specified observation angle , the values of parameters in a matter distribution model will depend on the assumed cosmological parameters . in this section ,",
    "we briefly show that while the values of the parameters vary with choice of cosmology , the overall fractional uncertainty in those parameters does not show significant variation .    in particular , because the nfw model is indexed to the critical density as a function of redshift , one might worry that variation in cosmology will have a strong effect on the accuracy of nfw model parameters .    as a simple test case , we present two tables that show the relative errors associated with sis and nfw model parameters for the physical arcs appearing at 35  arc sec in rxj1347 - 1145 as a function of cosmology .",
    "while we only consider flat cosmological models , we do consider a wide range in the matter density @xmath168 .",
    "tables [ cosmo_sis : table ] and [ cosmo_nfw : table ] present the relative errors in @xmath169 and @xmath99 respectively for a cutoff radius of 3.5  mpc . for the nfw model , @xmath104",
    "is set to the cutoff radius as before .",
    "both tables show that the accuracy of thin lens models changes only by a factor of 3 or so over a very wide range in flat cosmologies .",
    "figure [ consist45:fig ] shows comparisons of predicted einstein ring angles by conventional approaches and by properly truncated thin - lenses , compared to the relativistic prediction by numerical integration .",
    "one can see that given a fixed lens mass and distances to the lens and source , just the use of a thin - lens approximation results in a smaller einstein ring angle for the same truncated mass model . from this , as well as from tables",
    "[ sis_35:table ] and [ nfw_35:table ] , we conclude that the use of the thin - lens assumption alone leads to an overestimate of the mass , at least in the case of the two spherically symmetric models that we use .    in calculating the total bending angle accumulated along a photon path",
    ", the thin - lens assumption leads directly to the substitution of an undeflected path for the actual photon path , which , being curved , is normally longer than the undeflected path . in all models where the bending increases monotonically along the path , this procedure naturally leads to an underestimate of the total bending , as the integration takes place over a shorter interval . to compensate for the underestimate of bending , the thin - lens assumption overestimates the mass .    in the conventional sis model , setting the value of @xmath57 the same as the value in the truncated models essentially means that the conventional model contains more mass : see eq .",
    "[ mass1 ] . with more mass , the einstein ring angle grows , so the conventional einstein ring angles in fig .",
    "[ consist45:fig ] are larger than the correct angles",
    ".    figures [ sis_err : fig ] and [ vtheta35:fig ] indicate that for the same observation angles and source and lens positions , the inferred velocity dispersion for a truncated thin - lens model overestimates the true velocity dispersion . since at the same mass , the truncated thin - lens predicts a smaller angle , increasing the angle to align with the true observation angle increases the mass of the lens , and hence the velocity dispersion .",
    "the conventional sis can achieve this extra mass either by increasing the velocity dispersion or by adding mass along the line of sight past the truncation radius .",
    "this second method can , in fact , drive down the velocity dispersion . in fig .",
    "[ vtheta35:fig ] , we see a lower velocity dispersion for the conventional model because the extra mass has been stored along the line of sight . for other lens - source - ring angle configurations , plots similar to fig .",
    "[ vtheta35:fig ] show negative dips in the non - truncated square velocity dispersion error at small observation angles , which implies that the conventional sis model has a higher than correct velocity dispersion .    the relative error in the concentration parameter of nfw models , fig .",
    "[ dcerr2:fig ] , shows a similar effect .",
    "increasing the concentration parameter makes the core of the nfw profile steeper , placing more mass towards the center of the distribution . for the truncated nfw thin lens , increasing the concentration parameter increases the central mass to compensate for a required increased bending angle in the same way it did in the sis case .",
    "for the conventional nfw model , the trade - off between extra stored mass along the line of sight and increasing the steepness of the profile results in a shift in the sign of the relative error in @xmath99 .",
    "the principal finding of this paper is that , in the context of the current generation of precision cosmology experiments , the use of the conventional approach in strong gravitational lensing is justified .",
    "our figures and tables demonstrate that in a wide variety of strong lensing scenarios , and for two widely used mass models , the conventional approach works well in predicting cluster masses . except in cases where the truncation radius is on the order of 1 to 2 mpc , the errors in the sis predicted mass are generally less than @xmath1 .",
    "the error in concentration parameter for the nfw model is also small except for very high redshift clusters .",
    "this shows that concerns over the possibility of artificially high estimates of dark matter content in clusters as a result of the use of the thin - lens approximation are generally unfounded .",
    "for the first time , to our knowlegde , we have been able to show that the thin lens assumption and the removal of the truncation radius along the line of sight contribute to the error in very different measures .",
    "interestingly , the two approximations introduce errors in opposite directions : the thin - lens assumption underestimates the mass , whereas the removal of the truncation radius overestimates it .",
    "the error introduced by removing the truncation along the line of sight is of the same order of magnitude as that of the thin - lens assumption in the best case , and up to an order of magnitude larger in the worst case within our study .",
    "the truncation error is thus the dominant source of error in the conventional approach .",
    "this is a strong indication that , as precision increases in strong lensing observations , in order to gain a significant increase in accuracy it will be necessary , and perhaps even sufficient at first , simply to recover the truncation radius as an additional parameter in thin - lens models .",
    "truncation issues aside , we find that the error introduced by the thin lens assumpion alone for a given truncation method ( in our case , hard truncation ) varies between @xmath165 and @xmath0 in the sis case , and between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the nfw case for lenses at redshift less than 1 .",
    "knowledge of the size of this error should be taken into account when considering additional approximations such as proper truncation methods .",
    "errors of this size may become significant in the next 20 years as the observational precision increases .",
    "perhaps more important than the specific strong lensing finding in this paper is the possible implication of this finding for weak lensing surveys of galaxy clusters .",
    "strong lensing depends of the first derivative of the gravitational potential ( the christoffel symbols of the underlying metric ) , but weak lensing depends on the second derivative ( the curvature ) .",
    "one may advance the conjecture that the higher order ( derivative ) measurements of weak lensing might be less sensitive to the thin - lens approximation , and therefore more accurate in the determination of the cluster mass .    at the time at which",
    "the fundamental parameters are known to @xmath162 or better , this paper develops the appropriate steps for pursuing strong gravitational lensing without lens planes . in particular , we have demonstrated gravitational lensing by weak gravitational potentials in the appropriate cosmological backgrounds by numerical integration of the null geodesic equations of general relativity to be a feasible task .",
    "a long - standing argument for the use of the thin - lens approximation and against integrating the null geodesic equations has always been the high computational cost of numerical integration compared with the low cost of the ( essentially algebraic ) thin - lens approach .",
    "ten years ago this was essentially true .",
    "however , the current speed and memory capacity of even small workstations removes this argument against using the general relativistic equations instead of the thin - lens method or other higher order approximations such as those proposed by @xcite or @xcite .",
