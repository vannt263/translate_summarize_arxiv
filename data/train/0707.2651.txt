    "their usefulness is particularly enhanced by constructing a statistical sample with a well - understood selection function with the help of extensive and homogeneous surveys such as the hst snapshot survey @xcite or the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the number of strongly lensed quasars in systematic surveys is still limited . to construct a larger lens sample",
    ", we are conducting the sdss quasar lens search ( sqls ; * ? ? ? * ) based on spectroscopic quasar catalogs @xcite produced by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus far , it has discovered 16 galaxy - scale and 2 cluster - scale lensed quasars @xcite and re - discovered 8 previously known lensed quasars @xcite . a significant fraction of our lens candidates still require follow - up observations , so we expect to discover more lensed quasars in the coming years .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the discovery of a quadruply lensed quasar , sdss  j125107.57 + 293540.5 ( sdss  j1251 + 2935 ) , in the course of the sqls . quadruple lenses , which constitute roughly one - third of all lensed quasars , are not only visually interesting objects due to their characteristic morphologies but also scientifically important and useful objects .",
    "four image lenses provide many more constraints on the mass distribution of the lens .",
    "in particular , the image flux ratios expected for smooth , central potentials are relatively well - defined and the differences between the observed and model flux ratios can be used to study gravitational substructures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "anomalous flux ratios , where the observed and model image fluxes are in significant disagreement are fairly common and are due to the combined effects of the stars in the lens galaxy and satellite halos . in radio lenses",
    "this has been used to argue that the abundance of satellite halos is consistent with the predictions of standard cdm models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in optical lenses the effects of substructure and microlensing by the stars must be disentangled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in the next section , we briefly describe our algorithm for candidate selection from the sdss data .",
    "details of follow - up imaging using the university of hawaii 2.2-meter ( uh88 ) telescope are provided in   [ sec : image ] .",
    "we investigate mass models of the system in ",

    "throughout the paper we assume a cosmological model with matter density @xmath3 , cosmological constant @xmath4 , and hubble constant @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the sdss is conducting both a photometric survey @xcite in five broad - band optical filters @xcite and a spectroscopic survey with a multi - fiber spectrograph covering 3800 to 9200 at a resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated wide - field ( @xmath7 field of view ) 2.5-m telescope @xcite at the apache point observatory in new mexico , usa , covering 10,000 square degrees of the sky approximately centered on the north galactic cap .",
    "the imaging data are processed by the photometric pipeline @xcite , and spectroscopic quasar targets are selected from the imaging data according to the algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "fibers for the spectroscopic observations are assigned according to the tiling algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the imaging data have an astrometric accuracy better than about @xmath8 rms per coordinate @xcite and photometric zeropoint errors less than about 0.03 magnitude over the entire survey area @xcite .",
    "sdss  j1251 + 2935 is contained in data release 5 ( for the imaging data ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and later ( for the spectroscopic data ) .",
    "sdss  j1251 + 2935 was selected as a lensed quasar candidate using the morphological selection algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses the sdss morphological classification parameter objc_type and likelihood star_l that an object is fitted by a point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "although lensed quasar systems with small image separations are classified as single objects in the sdss data , the profiles are extended and are not consistent with either psf profiles or simple galaxy profiles .",
    "therefore , small separation lensed quasar candidates are selected as objects that have very small values of star_l .",
    "in addition , sdss  j1251 + 2935 satisfies additional selection requirements based on fits to the image with galfit @xcite which are applied to exclude false positives by single quasars . while some single quasars can pass the initial selection step , fits to such systems using two psfs lead to either very large magnitude differences or very small image separations that are indicative of systematic errors rather than a gravitational lens ( see   5 of @xcite ) .    the sdss @xmath9-band image of sdss  j1251 +",
    "2935 is shown in figure  [ fig : sdssimg ] .",
    "the psf magnitudes of sdss  j1251 + 2935 ( after correcting for galactic extinction ) are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath9 , and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "sdss  j1251 + 2935 is spectroscopically confirmed as a quasar at @xmath19 ( see figure  [ fig : spec ] for the sdss spectrum ) . in this spectrum",
    ", we can also see a series of absorption lines that indicate the presence of a bright early - type galaxy at @xmath20 .",
    "the presence of both components is a strong indication that this system is a gravitational lens .",
    "deeper and higher - resolution optical images of sdss  j1251 + 2935 were obtained on 2006 april 25 ( 08 seeing ) and 2006 may 3 ( 10 seeing ) using the 8k mosaic ccd camera ( uh8k , pixel scale of @xmath21 pixel@xmath22 ) and the orthogonal parallel transfer imaging camera ( optic , pixel scale of @xmath23 pixel@xmath22 ) at the uh88 telescope , respectively .",
    "we took @xmath24- and @xmath25-band images ( 270 sec exposure for each band ) with the uh8k , and @xmath26- , @xmath27- , and @xmath25-band images ( 400 sec exposure for each band ) with the optic .",
    "because the night of uh8k imaging was not photometric , we did not photometrically calibrate the uh8k images .",
    "we binned ( @xmath28 ) the optic images and used them for the astrometry and photometry of the system .",
    "the @xmath29 binned optic images ( @xmath30 ) and the original uh8k image ( @xmath24 ) are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : image_sub ] and the upper panels of figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "we used galfit to model these images with a series of models of increasing complexity .",
    "the only model that works well consists of 4 point sources and a central galaxy modeled with a srsic profile . in figure",
    "[ fig : image_sub ] , we demonstrate that subtracting 4 fitted psfs from the optic @xmath25-band image leaves an extended object or vice versa . if we further subtract the galaxy component , there remains virtually no residual .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : images ] summarize the residuals after subtracting the best models for each band s image .",
    "the galaxy flux is well - determined only in the @xmath27 and @xmath25-band images , so we neglected this component in the @xmath26 and @xmath24-band fits even though there are hints of its presence in the @xmath24-band residuals .",
    "we label the 4 point sources a  d in order of increasing @xmath25-band magnitudes and the central galaxy as g. we estimated that the galaxy has an effective radius of @xmath31 , ellipticity of @xmath32 , the srsic index of @xmath33 , and a major axis position angle of @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 color of g , @xmath36 , is consistent with an early - type galaxy at the measured redshift @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl : astro ] summarizes the relative astrometry and photometry of the system , where we defined the errors from the scatter between the fits using 6 different psf templates rather than the smaller statistical uncertainties of the individual fits .",
    "the errors are an order of magnitude larger than other systems where images are resolved even by visual inspection .",
    "we plot the color - color diagram ( @xmath37 and @xmath35 ) of the 4 point - like components in figure  [ fig : color ] and the flux ratios between the point - like components in figure  [ fig : flux ] .",
    "although the colors ( and flux ratios ) of the lensed images have large scatter among the images , they are consistent with each other given the large uncertainties .    in figure  [",
    "fig : sdssimg ] , we also labeled the nearby galaxies by their @xmath35 colors as measured using sextractor @xcite .",
    "there are several galaxies with colors similar to the lens galaxy to the southwest ( @xmath38 ) , and a larger group of generally bluer galaxies ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 to the north .",
    "this suggests that the lens is associated with a group , as is quite common among lensed quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we modeled the system using the _ lensmodel _ package @xcite to determine whether reasonable mass distributions can reproduce the observations .",
    "we first used the 7 parameter singular isothermal ellipsoid model ( sie ; the einstein radius @xmath41 , the ellipticity @xmath42 and its position angle @xmath43 , and the positions of the galaxy and the source quasar ) to fit the relative positions of the a  d and g components measured from the @xmath27-band image .",
    "the model fits the data well with @xmath44 for @xmath45 degrees of freedom .",
    "the model parameters are presented in table  [ tbl : chi2 ] and the fit is illustrated in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the predicted position angle of the lens galaxy , @xmath46 , is reasonably consistent with the measured position angle of @xmath47 , which is typical for gravitational lenses @xcite .",
    "based on the einstein radius of the model , the faber - jackson relations for gravitational lenses measured by @xcite predict a lens galaxy apparent magnitude of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) that agrees well with the measurement of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "good fits to quadruple lenses generally require both the ellipticity of the lens and an external shear @xcite , so for our second model we added a shear to the sie model ( the shear amplitude @xmath52 and its position angle @xmath53 ) . in this case , the best fit model overfits the data ( @xmath54 for @xmath55 ) .",
    "although the resulting large amplitude of the external shear is not inconsistent with n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lens galaxy position angle is misaligned with respect to the observations . moreover , the large ellipticity and external shear cross almost perpendicularly , which indicates that the model may not be realistic .",
    "if we add weak constraints to match the axis ratio and position angle of the sie component to the visible galaxy ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , then we obtain a good fit ( @xmath58 for dof=3 ) with a small external shear ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this suggests that external shear is not important for fitting the image positions despite the possible existence of nearby groups .    in all these models ,",
    "the predicted flux ratios differ from the observed flux ratios ( see table  [ tbl : chi2 ] and figure  [ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "this remains the case if we add the flux ratios and their measurement errors as model constraints .",
    "the cusp relation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a means of determining whether the flux ratios of the three cusp images are consistent with any smooth mass distribution . in this case",
    "we find @xmath60 and @xmath61 based on the @xmath27-band flux ratios and the sie model , which is marginally consistent with the range of distributions found for smooth lens models .",
    "the origin of the problem is presumably substructure in the gravitational potential of the lens due to either microlensing by the stars or sub - halos , since the observed flux ratios show no significant wavelength dependence .",
    "we note , however , that evidence for anomalous flux ratios is not conclusive , mainly because of large astrometric and photometric errors .",
    "we report the discovery of the quadruply imaged quasar sdss  j1251 + 2935 . the lensing hypothesis is confirmed by the facts that i ) the sdss spectrum of the system shows the emission lines of a quasar at @xmath62 and the absorption lines of a galaxy at @xmath63 , ii ) the uh8k and optic images confirm that the system consists of 4 blue point - like components and an extended object whose color is consistent with an elliptical galaxy at @xmath64 , iii ) the geometry of the system is that of a typical cusp lens and can be well reproduced by a sie model with reasonable parameter values , and iv ) the luminosity of the lens galaxy is consistent with the expected luminosity from the faber - jackson relation .",
    "this system is the second lowest redshift lensed quasar after rxj1131 - 1231 @xcite at @xmath65 .",
    "the flux ratios of the three cusp images of the lens show a modest flux ratio anomaly , whose origins could be better constrained with higher resolution images under better observing conditions .",
