    "on february 1974 , at the same aaas meeting in san francisco where the discovery of grbs by the vela satellites was publicly announced @xcite , the possible relation of grbs with the `` moment of gravitational collapse '' leading to a bh formation was advanced ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite considered , for definiteness , the vacuum polarization process occurring in an overcritical kerr - newman bh ( knbh ) .",
    "evidence was given for : a ) the formation of a vast amount of @xmath7-baryon plasma ; b ) the energetics of grbs of the order of @xmath8  erg , where @xmath9 is the bh mass , implying their cosmological origin ; c ) the ultra - high energy cosmic rays with energy up to @xmath10  ev originating from such an extreme electrodynamical process .",
    "soon after , the role of an @xmath7 plasma for the origin of grbs was also considered by @xcite .",
    "it took almost thirty years to clarify some of the analogies and differences between these two processes of @xmath7-pair creation leading , respectively , to the alternative concepts of  fireball \" and  fireshell \" @xcite .    already in @xmath11 , well before the establishment of the grb cosmological nature and energetics",
    ", @xcite gave support to the cosmological interpretation of grbs and indicated in merging ns binaries their possible origin .",
    "they also pointed out the relevance of such ns ",
    "ns mergers for the occurrence of r - process , as well as for the emission of gravitational radiation , indicating the uncertainty in the determination of their rate of occurrence .    following the launch of the compton satellite and the observations by the batse detector @xcite , a phenomenological classification based on the prompt @xmath12 duration was advanced : grbs were classified into long grbs for @xmath13  s , and short grbs for @xmath14  s @xcite .    shortly after @xcite indicated the possible cosmological origin of short grbs originating in binary ns mergers .",
    "they also introduced the clear indication of the role of @xmath15 annihilation leading to the formation of an @xmath7 plasma .",
    "this paper was followed by a large number of theoretical works including the gravitational wave emission in newtonian , post - newtonian , and general relativistic treatments ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the @xmath15 annihilation leading to an @xmath7 plasma ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .    soon after the paper by @xcite , @xcite also supported the cosmological origin of grbs and introduced the concept of bh - accretion - disks , produced by the collapse of a very massive star .",
    "such a system was indicated by its author as a _ collapsar _ and was assumed to be the origin of ultrarelativistic jets expected to occur by the same author in long grbs .",
    "for a recent review see .",
    "after the determination of the cosmological nature of grbs @xcite and the confirmation of their outstanding energy ( @xmath16 erg ) , we returned to our grb scenario @xcite . in a period of four years , from 1997 to 2001",
    ", we developed a fully relativistic grb theoretical model examining , as well , the dynamics of the @xmath7 plasma originating the grb emission ( the fireshell model , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and section  [ sec : fireshell ] ) .",
    "the fireshell model applies to both short and long grbs .    the origin of short grbs from ns ",
    "ns ( or ns - bh ) binaries as `` in - states '' has been confirmed by strong observational and theoretical evidences . in this article",
    "we address specifically some of the latest results within the fireshell model @xcite on the possible presence or absence of a bh formation in ns ",
    "ns mergers , the consequent classification of short bursts into s - grfs , when no bh is formed ( see section  [ sec : descr_s - grfs ] ) , and s - grbs , when a bh is formed ( see section  [ sec : descr_sgrbs ] ) , and the computation of their occurrence rate ( see section  [ sec : rates ] ) .",
    "the application of the fireshell model to the case of long grbs followed a longer path for reaching a proper understanding of the overall phenomenon .",
    "the first application of our model to a long grb was implemented on grb 991216 @xcite . in these papers a clear difference between the thermal component observed at the transparency of the @xmath7 plasma , the proper grb ( p - grb ) emission @xcite , and the non - thermal remaining part , later called prompt emission @xcite , was evidenced .",
    "this fully relativistic approach was not readily accepted by the grb community , also in view of its objective technical complexity and novelties in the theoretical physics scenario .",
    "some authors attempted to describe the grb phenomenon by simplified newtonian approaches , e.g . , those based on the concept of _ magnetars _ . as the detailed observations of the x - ray afterglow by the _",
    "swift_-xrt were obtained , as well as the high energy emission by the fermi - lat @xcite , our model has correspondingly evolved pointing out the precise common power - law behavior of the rest - frame @xmath17@xmath18 kev x - ray luminosity light curves @xcite , as well as the nesting properties @xcite . as pointed out in the present article , the concept of long grbs has evolved into xrfs and bdhne , depending on the possible presence or absence of a bh in their formation process ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is appropriate to recall that the quest for having progenitors for the collapsar hypothesized by @xcite led to an interesting direction of research dealing with a binary system composed of two very massive stars of @xmath19  m@xmath20 each .",
    "the large masses involved in these systems were introduced in order to form a bh at the end of their evolution .",
    "similarly , the large amount of angular momentum of the system would guarantee the formation of an accretion disks needed in the collapsar model @xcite .",
    "up to six different scenarios were there envisaged leading to a _ collapsar _ , as well as a few leading , alternatively , to a variety of binary compact systems .",
    "the need for choosing low - metallicity massive stars followed from the expectation of the formation large bhs in their evolution @xcite .",
    "the elimination of h from metal - rich massive stars would follow naturally , but the formation of a bh was not expected in their final stage of evolution @xcite .",
    "the spatial and temporal coincidence of a long grb explosion with an optical sn , first observed in the association between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw , created a profound conceptual turmoil in the grb community .",
    "woosley and collaborators postulated the birth of a sn out of a collapsar .    in our approach , grbs were supposed to originate from the bh formation , while sne were expected to lead only to nss ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therin ) .",
    "we consequently introduced a new paradigm to explain the coincidence of these two qualitative and quantitative different astrophysical events in space and time : the birth of a sn and the occurrence of a grb .",
    "the induced gravitational collapse ( igc ) paradigm was then introduced .",
    "this approach differs from alternative descriptions of the grb - sn coincidences occurring , e.g. , in the _ magnetars _ and the _ collapsar _ models , where the two events are coming from a single progenitor star , and takes full advantage of the recent observations of sne ibc in interacting binary systems .    in a first formulation we considered a finely tuned process : the grb triggering the explosion of a binary companion star very close to the onset of the sn @xcite",
    "this scenario soon led to the alternative igc paradigm in which a co@xmath0 undergoes a sn explosion in presence of a ns companion in a tight binary system .",
    "this is also by itself an unlikely event which in order to occur needs a fine tuning of the initial conditions of the binary system .",
    "this scenario was shown to be consistent with population synthesis analysis @xcite .",
    "the sn explosion induces a hypercritical accretion of its ejecta onto the companion ns , leading to the formation of a more massive ns ( mns ) , when the ns critical mass @xmath21 is not reached , or to the formation of a bh with the associated grb emission in the opposite case ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the igc scenario was first tested and verified in grb 090618 .",
    "it soon became clear that the occurrence of a grb is far from being a single event , but it is part of an authentic laboratory composed of a variety of astrophysical relativistic phenomena preceeding and following the prompt grb emission .",
    "we adopted as progenitor of our co@xmath0ns binary system the massive binaries independently considered in @xcite and @xcite . in our case , the late evolution of such massive binary systems do not lead to a collapsar , nor to an hypernova , but to a much richer and vast number of possibilities , made possible by our igc paradigm .",
    "consistently with the considerations by @xcite , indicating that xrfs , x - ray rich bursts , and all long grbs are part of a same population which we show to originate in the hypercritical accretion process of the sn ejecta onto a binary companion ns .    in agreement with the considerations by @xcite for a sub - classification of long bursts into low - luminous and high - luminous grbs , we have divided the long bursts into two different scenarios depending on the distance between the co@xmath0 and the ns binary companion @xcite .",
    "correspondingly two different sub - classes of long bursts , both originating in the hypercritical accretion process of the igc scenario , have been shown to exist @xcite : the xrfs , which clearly include low - luminous grbs , such as grb 060218 @xcite , when no bh is formed ( see section  [ sec_3_prot_rat ] ) , and the bdhne , such as grb 130427a @xcite , when a bh is formed ( see section  [ sec : descr_bdhne ] ) .",
    "their occurrence rates have been computed ( see section  [ sec : rates ] ) .",
    "instead of proposing just a new classification , we also give the description of its underlying physical origin : the hypercritical accretion process of the sn ejecta onto a binary companion ns , with the full associated theoretical treatments at the basis of the igc paradigm .    to the above four sub - classes of long and short bursts",
    ", we have recently added a new hybrid sub - class of ultrashort grbs ( u - grbs ) which , as recently pointed out in @xcite , can originate during the further evolution of the bdhne out - states .",
    "indeed , nearly 100@xmath22 of the ns - bh binaries which are the outcome of bdhne remain bound .",
    "their orbital velocities are high and even large kicks are unlikely to unbind these systems .",
    "they represent a new family of ns - bh binaries unaccounted for in current standard population synthesis analyses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and section  [ sec : rate5 ] ) .",
    "the above considerations based on the igc paradigm and the ns - ns paradigm as progenitors encompass and classify into sub - classes most of the known astrophysical systems related to grbs .",
    "we finally recall the existence of a class of long grbs occurring in a low density circumburst medium ( cbm ) with density @xmath23 @xmath24 , with hybrid short / long burst properties in their @xmath25-ray light curves : 1 ) an initial spike - like harder emission and 2 ) a prolonged softer emission observed up to a hundred seconds .",
    "these bursts do not have an associated sn , even though in the case of a low value of the cosmological redshift its detection would not be precluded .",
    "the prototype of such systems is grb 060614 @xcite .",
    "the progenitor for this class of long bursts has been identified in a binary system composed of a ns and a white dwarf ( wd ) @xcite .",
    "their merger leads to a mns with additional orbiting material , but not to an authentic grb .",
    "we refer to these systems , historically addressed as disguised short grb , as gamma - ray flashes ( grfs ) , see , e.g. , grb 060614 , @xcite and grb 071227 , @xcite ) .    in the following",
    "we adopt the term _ burst _ only for those systems leading to the bh formation , namely to s - grbs , u - grbs and bdhne .",
    "we refer to the term _ flash _ , instead , only for those systems not leading to the bh formation , namely to s - grfs , grfs and xrfs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : summary ] ) .",
    "the main topic addressed in the present article is to estimate the rates of occurrence of the xrfs , bdhne , s - grfs , s - grbs , u - grbs , and grfs and to give a generel description of these grb sub - classes . in section  [ sec : fireshell ]",
    "we present a short summary on the fireshell model . in section  [ sec:1052erg ]",
    "we discuss the @xmath26  erg lower limit in binary systems leading to bh formation . after describing the observational properties of the above sub - classes , their interpretation within the igc paradigm , the ns - ns merger scenario and the fireshell scenario , we present some prototypes ( see sections  [ sec_3_prot_rat ] , [ sec : descr_bdhne ] , [ sec : descr_s - grfs ] , [ sec : descr_sgrbs ] , [ sec : rate5 ] , and [ sec : ds ] , respectively ) .",

    "the observed grb occurrence rate is defined by the convolution of both ( likely redshift - dependent ) luminosity function , which describes the fraction of bursts with isotropic equivalent luminosities in the interval @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and cosmic grb occurrence rate , which gives the number of sources at different redshifts .",
    "the definition of both of these functions is still an open issue and depends on _ a priori _ assumptions and some investigations have been carried out in the literature ( see , e.g. , , for long bursts , @xcite , for short bursts , and @xcite , for both long and short bursts ) . to complicate the matter , also the instrumental sensitivity threshold ,",
    "the field of view @xmath41 , and the operational time @xmath42 of the various detectors @xmath43 observing grbs introduce additional uncertainties to the problem .    in the following",
