    "it is generally recognized that circumstellar disks provide the most economical means of accounting for the spectral energy distributions of t tauri stars .",
    "the extended , flat distributions of gas and dust can easily generate the observed broad spectral energy distributions ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; adams , lada , & shu 1987 ) , and calculations of disk spectra have been successful at reproducing many observations of these stars ( calvet et al .",
    "1992 ; dalessio et al .",
    "1999 ; chiang & goldreich 1997 , 1999 ) . in some cases , the disks are apparent in images of the stars , either via scattered light or in silhouette against a background light source ( burrows et al . 1996 ; mccaughrean & odell 1996 ) .    the disks may be heated either radiatively by the central star or by energy released as matter accretes through the disk driven by turbulent viscosity .",
    "it is still a matter of debate which of these is more important for any given star , and the variety of spectral energy distributions observed indicates that the principal heating source may be different in various star+disk systems .",
    "it is important to determine the extent to which radiation or accretion dominates , because almost all other aspects of our understanding of these disks depends on the energy budget as a function of radius .",
    "for example , the amount of convection will depend on the vertical temperature gradient in the disk atmosphere .",
    "a clear distinction between an atmosphere heated from the top by radiation and from the bottom by accretion is the presence of spectral features .",
    "an atmosphere heated from above by radiation will generally produce emission features , unless the viewing angle is very close to the plane of the disk . a disk heated from the mid ",
    "plane by accretion will have an atmosphere with a vertically decreasing temperature , and all spectral features will be in absorption .",
    "observations of disk spectra should provide a good discriminant between these two possibilities .",
    "for example , fu ori objects , a class of eruptive variables whose luminosities are dominated by accretion , exhibit deep absorption features due to their low surface gravity disk atmospheres ( kenyon & hartmann , 1997 ) .",
    "cohen & witteborn ( 1985 ) showed that some t tauri stars had broad resonance features near 10 @xmath1 m , although it was not known at the time where these lines were formed and the signal  to  noise ratios were not high .",

    "the region between 5.911.7  is characterized by the presence of the 10  silicate feature , which is seen in emission in most of the stars in our sample .",

    "( but closer to the one obtained nearest in time ) .",
    "the observed flux for  is similar to that reported by grtler et al . though the line shape is noticeably different .",
    "however , differences in line shape could be due to differences in reduction techniques .",
    "there is no evidence for emission from the unidentified infrared bands at 6.2 and 7.7 @xmath1 m often attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "such features have been observed in the spectra of objects that illuminate reflection nebulosities ( e.g. grtler et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the 6.2 and 7.6  features lie in a region of the spectrum well measured in our data .",
    "the main interest of the silicate feature seen in these tts spectra lies in the possibility it offers of investigating the optically thin dust component of the circumstellar environment .",
    "historically , the feature has been described as optically thin emission from dust having optical depth @xmath15 and temperature t@xmath16 ( cohen and witteborn 1985 ) , with the possible addition of some line - of - sight extinction ( hanner et al .",
    "we prefer to follow a different approach , and compare the observed features to the predictions of specific models of the circumstellar environment of tts . at present ,",
    "the most interesting suggestion on the origin on the silicate emission is that of calvet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ; cg97 ) , who point out that the feature could form in the optically thin surface layers of a circumstellar disk , heated well above the temperature of the disk midplane by the stellar radiation .",
    "an alternative possibility has been suggested for the binary star gw ori , namely that the silicate emission originates in a disk  gap \" , cleared by the dynamical perturbation of a companion star . a small amount of residual dust in the gap is heated by the stellar radiation to temperatures of a few hundred degrees and causes the observed emission ( mathieu et al . 1991 ) .",
    "this model predicts very little continuum emission in the 10  region , as observed in gw ori , where there is clear evidence of a mid - infrared dip in the sed . this does not seem to be the case of the tts in our sample ( robberto et al .",
    "1999 ) , and we will not discuss it further .",
    "we will follow here the very elegant and simple treatment of cg97 to predict the 10  feature intensity of each individual star , and we refer the reader to their paper for a more detailed description of the model . in cg97 models ,",
    "the stellar radiation penetrates the disk outer layers to an optical depth @xmath17 along the disk plane .",
    "@xmath18 is measured at the wavelength where the stellar flux @xmath19 peaks ( roughly at frequency @xmath20 2.1 - 3 @xmath21 hz ( 11.4 @xmath1 m ) for the stars in our sample ) . in the direction orthogonal to the disk surface ,",
    "the optical depth at @xmath22 is :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the grazing angle .",
    "if the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction , @xmath24 can be written as ( @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 where r is the distance from the star and @xmath27 measures the gravitational potential at the stellar surface : @xmath28 k is the stefan  boltzman constant and @xmath1 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "this superheated layer is optically thin in the orthogonal direction at all wavelengths .",
    "its emission can be easily computed as : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the distance of the star , @xmath32 the planck function , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the inner and outer radius of the dusty disk and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the dust absorption cross section at @xmath37 and @xmath38 being the dust cross section at @xmath22 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath19 on the disk viewing angle is weak unless the disk is seen practically edge - on and occults the emission coming from the inner region of the disk itself ( chiang and goldreich 1999 ) .",
    "the dust temperature @xmath39 of grains in the optically thin atmosphere depends on the stellar radiation field and on the grain emissivity . for the cases we are considering , we have checked using the radiation transfer code",
    "kindly provided to us by e. krgel that it can be expressed as a power - law function of the distance from the star @xmath40 : @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 . for the stars in our sample , @xmath33 , the distance from the star where the grains sublimate ( @xmath44 k ) , varies between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , depending on the stellar temperature .",

    "once the stellar parameters are fixed , @xmath48 depends only on the dust cross section . to clarify the following discussion ,",
    "we re - write the ratio @xmath49 as the product ( @xmath50).(@xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 is the opacity at the peak of the silicate feature .",
    "the first term @xmath50 determines the shape of the feature and depends only on the specific properties of the silicates that dominate the feature ( size , mineralogy , and allotropic form ) .",
    "the second term @xmath51 determines the feature intensity and is essentially the `` efficiency '' of converting stellar photons into silicate emission .",
    "this depends not only on the dust properties enumerated above , but also on attributes which determine the relative dust opacities from the visible / near  ir ( @xmath38 ) to that near the feature itself in the mid  ir ( @xmath52 ) ; for example , the relative contribution of carbonaceous and silicate grains to @xmath38 . after a preliminary exploration of a variety of silicates ( see  4.2 ) ,",
    "we have adopted for @xmath50 the cross section of 1.2  radius pyroxene ( mg(0.5)fe(0.43)ca(0.03)al(0.04)sio@xmath53 ; jaeger et al .",
    "1994 ) between 5.5 and 15 , but kept as a free parameter @xmath54 .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ models ] . in each panel , the dots show the observed spectrum .",
    "the solid curve is the model prediction , computed by adding to the emission of the disk atmosphere the power - law continuum emission shown by the dashed lines in fig .",

    "this characterization of the continuum emission is somewhat uncertain . cg97",
    "compute the emission of the optically thick disk midplane in addition to that of the outer optically thin layers .",
    "one could , in principle , use their model to obtain values of the continuum emission consistent with the structure of the disk atmosphere required to reproduce the observed silicate emission .",
    "however , contrary to the atmospheric emission in the 10  region , the contribution of the disk midplane to the continuum depends on the inclination of the disk with respect to the line of sight .",
    "moreover , at wavelengths @xmath56 m the disk midplane emission is more sensitive to viscous heating and the inner disk radius ( e.g. meyer , calvet , & hillenbrand , 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , we defer the discussion of the continuum emission ( and of its consistency with the results discussed in this paper ) to a forthcoming contribution ( robberto et al . 2000 ) where we will make use of the broad - band fluxes measured by iso over the wavelength range 3.4  200  ( see robberto et al .",
    "1999 for a presentation of some preliminary results ) .",
    "the value of @xmath54 which provides the best approximate fit to the observations given the assumptions outlined above is given in each panel .",
    "note that for each star the model - predicted intensity of the feature ( continuum subtracted ) is simply proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the assumption of the cross - section of 1.2  pyroxene grains for @xmath57 in the model calculations gives a reasonable fit to the observed feature shapes .",
    "however , it is by no means unique . in our exploration of the effects of dust mineralogy on the shape of the feature , we have used as a reference the  spectrum , because of its high signal  to  noise ; the results would not be different for the other stars .",

    "1994 ) , and for mixtures of olivine and pyroxene of 1  and 0.1  radius .",
    "olivine or small pyroxene grains can not reproduce the feature shape ; a good fit is provided by rather large ( @xmath59 ) pyroxene grains and by mixtures of olivine and pyroxene of radii @xmath0 .",
    "much larger grains can be excluded , since they give an emission feature peaked at too long wavelengths .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ mineralogy ] shows the  model predictions for draine and lee ( 1984 ; dl ) astronomical silicates .",
    "the optical constants of such silicates were constrained to reproduce the shape of the 10  feature observed by forrest et al .",

    "we find good agreement between the observations in the direction of  and dl astronomical silicates ; the only significant discrepancy occurs at long wavelengths , where the dl feature is broader .",
    "the trapezium feature is significantly broader than that observed in the diffuse ism ( see draine , 1989 ) .",
    "the comparison with tts seems to indicate that silicates in the trapezium region are similar to those in tts disks , and are consistent with a mixture of amorphous olivines and pyroxenes .    before discussing further our observations in the context of cg97 models ,",
    "let us point out that we may have some evidence of two additional emission components at 8.5  and 11.3 .",
    "excess emission at long wavelengths with respect to model predictions is seen in almost all stars .",
    "a feature at 11.3 is typical of crystalline silicates , and it has been detected in sws spectra of some  stars of intermediate mass ( malfait et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .",
    "however , our observational errors are larger at longer wavelengths , and the only clear case where we see a secondary peak at @xmath6010  is . also , the long - wavelength excess can be an artifact of our crude fitting of the continuum between 5.88 @xmath1 m",
    "this can be checked by combining our phot - s data with observations at longer wavelengths .",

    "however , this feature sits near the 8.3 @xmath1 m region noted above for which the calibration is somewhat uncertain and so should be treated with caution . the absence of features at 6.2 and 7.6  rules out the possibility that the excess emission at @xmath61 and 11.3 could be due to pahs .",

    "sections calculated for various types of grains .",

    "the olivine - pyroxene mixtures that reproduce the observed feature shapes have @xmath65 .",
    "predictions for conglomerates and/or large particles give values of @xmath55 in the range 11.5 . henning and stognienko ( 1996 ) , for example , give @xmath66 for conglomerates made of pyroxene , iron , and olivine .",
    "pollack et al .",
    "( 1994 ) compact grains , which include a mixture of silicates , iron , organic materials and water ice , have @xmath67 ( see henning and stognienko 1996 ) . in all these cases ,",
    "the predicted shape of the feature should be similar to the observed one .",
    "it is also possible to reproduce the required @xmath55 value with pyroxene grains , if there is a contribution to the 1  opacity from carbonaceous grains .",
    "however this contribution must be significantly smaller than in the interstellar medium ; the mrn model of interstellar extinction of draine and lee ( 1984 ) has a 1  opacity dominated by graphite and @xmath68 , depending on the exact value of . in summary ,",
    "amorphous olivine and pyroxene mixtures can roughly reproduce both the intensity and the shape of the observed features for most of the tts in our sample .",

    "pyroxene grains of radius 11.2  ( which fit well the shape of the feature ) have @xmath71 .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that very strong silicate features may occur when the dust opacity is dominated by pyroxene grains over the whole range of wavelengths @xmath72 .",
    "however , we should point out that  is a rather complex object .",
    "it is a binary system , with an infrared companion ( irc ; component b ) at a separation of about 2.7@xmath73 ( chelli et al .",
    "feigelson and kriss ( 1989 ) report that this faint companion is an emission ",
    "line star of intermediate spectral type ( g3g7 ) .",
    "although component b is very faint in the visible , it dominates the emission at wavelengths longer than 2.0  ( chelli et al . 1988 ) .",
    "there are a handful of such objects known in t tauri systems , where the irc is responsible for the bulk of the ir emission and is thought to be in an earlier evolutionary state .",
    "recent , unpublished 10  broadband images ( robberto et al . and",
    "stanke and zinnecker , private communications ) confirm that the 10  emission comes from a single source , very likely glass ib .",
    "we have computed the silicate emission of glass ib , assuming a _ stellar _ luminosity ( neglecting the contribution of active accretion ) of 3.2 , an effective temperature of 5400 k and a mass of 2 ( e.g. koresko et al . 1997 ) ; the value of @xmath55 we derive is @xmath74 , similar to that obtained under the assumption that glass ia is powering the feature .",
    "a comparison of silicate spectra obtained for  with observations of other t tauri+irc systems sheds no light on the matter .",
    "spatially unresolved observations of t tauri n & s indicate a nearly featureless 10  continuum ( hanner et al .",
    "however , spatially resolved 10 @xmath1 m observations show that silicate emission is associated with the visible star , while the ir companion has silicate in absorption ( herbst et al .",
    "sx cha , the other star in our sample with an irc , has a rather normal silicate emission feature .",
    "it is possible that in  the silicate emission forms not in a disk , but in a more spherically distributed warm dust component .",
    "we can not solve this puzzle with the data presently available . any model which adequately explains the silicate emission feature in this system ,",
    "must also explain its variability ( cf .",
    "grtler et al . 1999 ) .",
    "for the moment , the best explanation is that in glass ia or in glass ib the dust has an anomalous composition , perhaps including a small contribution from crystalline silicates .",
    "only one star in our sample ( ) has a very small ratio l@xmath13/and a low value of @xmath55 ( and a rather noisy spectrum ) .",
    "there are a number of effects that , in principle , can result in a silicate feature somewhat weaker than predicted by cg97 models .",
    "firstly , the disk flaring may be smaller than assumed in cg97 .",
    "this may happen , for example , if the dust is not well mixed with the gas , or if the temperature gradient in the vertical direction affects the density profile , which cg97 compute from the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium of an isothermal gas ( see discussion in kenyon and hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "second , in cases where the disk is seen nearly edge  on , one does expect to observe silicate features in absorption as observed in a few cases by cohen and witteborn ( 1985 ) and as modelled by chiang and goldreich ( 1999 ) .",
    "a third important point is that heating of the disk by viscous dissipation of accretion energy may invert the vertical temperature gradient , so that the temperature is higher in the disk midplane than in the outer layer . in this extreme case",
    ", the feature should appear in absorption ( calvet et al .",
    "1992 ) . in reality",
    ", this is probably rarely the case , since about half of the accretion luminosity is emitted as uv radiation near the stellar surface and may contribute to the radiative heating of the disk outer layer ( dalessio et al .",
    "in fact , fu ori , where the accretion luminosity is much larger than the photospheric one , has very weak silicate emission ( hanner et al .",
    "a study of the sed of  over the whole range from uv to millimeter wavelengths , which can shed light on its properties , is deferred to a forthcoming paper ( robberto et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "to summarize , the comparison with cg97 models provides a strong indication that ; i ) most tts disks must be flared approximately as predicted by hydrostatic equilibrium models ; ii ) accretion , when present , does not dominate the disk heating , which is mostly due to stellar radiation at radii @xmath75 au ; and iii ) the viewing geometry for the stars in our sample is not perfectly edge  on .",
    "we have presented in this paper phot - s spectra of nine classical tts in chamaeleon . the spectra cover the wavelength ranges 2.54.9 and 5.911.7 .",
    "the only prominent feature in the spectra is the silicate emission feature at about 10 , which is seen in all the observed stars .",
    "we discuss the possibility that the feature forms in the outer , optically thin layers of a circumstellar disk .",
    "if the disk heating is dominated by the stellar radiation , this disk atmosphere is hotter than the disk midplane , and emission features may be seen .",
    "we have followed the description of the disk atmosphere developed by chiang and goldreich ( 1997 ) , and computed the predicted silicate feature for each star in our sample .",
    "we find good agreement between the model predictions and the observations for most stars .    in these models ,",
    "the shape of the feature depends on the properties ( size , chemical composition and allotropic form ) of the silicates that dominate the 10  opacity , while its intensity depends on the ratio ( @xmath55 ) of the opacity at the peak of the feature to the opacity at the wavelength where the stellar radiation is maximum .",
    "these are the only free parameters of the models , once the stellar properties ( luminosity , effective temperature and mass ) are known . for six stars out of nine a good fit between models and observations",
    "is obtained with values of @xmath76 , much larger than in the diffuse ism , where @xmath77 .",
    "this , and the analysis of the shape of the features , suggests that silicates in the tts disks are likely to be a mixture of amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains with radii @xmath0 , with little contribution to the visual and near - infrared opacity from other dust components .",
    "alternatively , our observations can be reproduced by large ( @xmath59 ) pyroxene grains , with a significant contribution to the short - wavelength opacity from grains other than silicates .",
    "the identification of disk atmospheres as the origin of silicate emission is certainly not a unique explanation .",
    "full disk models , capable of reproducing both the silicate spectrum and the observed continuum over a large range of wavelengths need to be computed .",
    "disk parameters , such as inclination , accretion luminosity , etc . , have to be consistent with what we know about each individual star .",
    "broad - band phot observations of the same tts discussed here over the wavelength range 3.4 - 200 have been obtained and are currently being investigated ( robberto et al .",
    "however , the results presented here give already some interesting information on the disk properties .",
    "as discussed in  4 , we have assumed that the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction ( flared ) .",
    "atmospheres of flat disks are much less extended , and will reproduce the observed silicate emission only for unreasonably large values of @xmath55 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "secondly , strong heating due to accretion in the disk midplane will reduce or suppress the inverse temperature gradient in the vertical direction and reduce the strength of the silicate emission . in the stars we observed ,",
    "accretion is likely to contribute only marginally to the disk heating at radii @xmath79 0.1 au .",
