    "recently , canuto & mazzitelli ( 1991 , cm ) proposed an improved model for stellar convection . being derived from a turbulence model , it takes into account the contribution of the full spectrum of the turbulent convective eddies , to the convective flux . in stellar interiors",
    "the microscopic viscosity is very small compared to the turbulent viscosity , implying that the turbulent spectrum spans many decades in wavenumber space .",
    "therefore , in this respect , the cm model represents a significant improvement over the mixing length theory approach ( mlt ) which is a one eddy ( the largest ) approximation to the spectrum .",
    "moreover , in the cm model , the turbulent mixing length scale is the depth @xmath2 , so there is no need for an adjustable free parameter like the mlt @xmath3-parameter .",
    "the resulting convective fluxes are higher than those of the mlt for high convective efficiencies , and smaller than them for low efficiencies .",
    "the model performs better than the mlt when applied to stellar structure ( dantona & mazzitelli , 1994 ; mazzitelli , dantona & caloi 1995 , stothers & chin 1995 , althaus & benvenuto 1996 ) , helioseismology ( baturin & mironova 1995 , monteiro et al .",
    "1995 , antia & basu 1995 ) and stellar atmospheres ( kupka 1995 ) .    in the cm model , the turbulence spectral function @xmath4 is determined by the timescale controlling the energy input from _ buoyancy _ , that is , the _ source _ that generates the turbulence .",
    "this timescale is expected to depend on the parameters of the source as well as on the _ turbulence spectrum _ itself .",
    "the quantification of the latter dependence , within the cm model , is far from obvious .",
    "thus , cm ( 1991 ) assumed that the above timescale can be approximated by the inverse of the growth rate of the unstable modes of the _ linearized _ equations . by construction ,",
    "the latter depends only on the source and is _ independent _ of the _ turbulence _ it generates .",
    "the linear rate was used also by canuto goldman and chasnov ( 1987,cgc ) who , generalizing the work of canuto and goldman ( 1985 ) , proposed a model for fully developed turbulence .",
    "the linear rate was also employed by hartke canuto & dannevik ( 1988 ) in the framework of a dia ( direct interaction approximation ) model for turbulent convection and by canuto , cheng , hartke , & schilling ( 1991 ) for edqnm ( eddy damped quasi - normal markovian ) models .",
    "the rate of energy input in the cm model must be improved since a fully developed turbulence is expected to regulate the energy input from source ( buoyancy ) .",
    "the lack of feedback from the turbulence on the energy input , prevents the model from being selfconsistent .",
    "however , because of the complex structure of the edqnm closure , the implementation of a selfconsistent rate into the formalism of the cm model is not simple .",
    "thus , we were forced to simplify the structure of the nonlinear interactions , so as to be able to formulate a workable selfconsistent treatment .    in modeling the nonlinear interactions",
    ", we follow the work of cgc ( 1987 ) .",
    "however , in the present model we generalize the definition of the eddy correlation timescale , thus correcting some shortcomings in the physics involved , and leading to an improved closure .",
    "the resulting effective rate of energy input from the source ( buoyancy ) depends now on both the _ source _ and the _ turbulence_. as stated , the present approach is complementary to that of the cm model . here , the focus is on the selfconsistent rate of energy input and not on the closure , which is much simpler than that of the cm model .    in spite of the highly nonlinear structure of the model equations , it is possible to solve them _ directly _ with no need for iterations .",
    "this reduced considerably the amount of numerical work required , and allowed for an exploration of the model for a wide range of values of the convective efficiency , @xmath5 , defined in equation ( 51 ) . for each value of @xmath5",
    "we obtained the spectral function which determines the turbulence bulk quantities .",
    "thus , we computed , as functions of @xmath5 , the convective flux , the turbulent viscosity , the turbulent mean squared velocity and the root mean squared turbulent pressure .",
    "we have applied the new model to the main sequence evolution of a solar model as well as to the evolutions of an extreme pop ii chemical composition ( y=0.23 , z=@xmath6 ) stars with @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the results are generally similar to those of the cm model",
    ". however , the new model has the advantage that the overshoot required to fit the solar model is much smaller , in accord with recent empirical estimates , and the ages of globular clusters are also somewhat smaller than the corresponding ages in the cm model ( which in turn are smaller than those derived within the mlt framework ) .",
    "let us consider a fully developed stationary turbulent convection characterized by the spectral functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , of the turbulent velocity , temperature fluctuations and the turbulent convective flux , respectively .",
    "before doing so , we write the dynamical time - dependent equations obeyed by these spectral functions ( yamaguchi 1963 )",
    ".    @xmath11    @xmath12 and    @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote the nonlinear transfer terms for the turbulent velocity , temperature , and convective flux . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath3 is the coefficient of thermal volume expansion at constant pressure ( equaling @xmath18 for an ideal gas ) , @xmath19 is the superadiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath20 is the microscopic viscosity , and @xmath21 is the microscopic thermometric conductivity appearing in the expression for the conductive flux @xmath22 in stellar interiors , the dominant conductive flux is the radiative flux and thus @xmath21 is the radiative thermometric conductivity .",
    "the function @xmath23 is given by    @xmath24 with @xmath25 measuring the anisotropy of the eddy corresponding to the wavenumber @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the horizontal and vertical wavenumbers , respectively ( the vertical direction is that of the gravitational acceleration ) .    in equation ( 1 )",
    ", @xmath29 plays the role of the energy source driving the velocity fluctuations .",
    "more precisely , it equals the rate of energy per unit mass and per unit wavenumber , fed to the turbulence velocity field at wavenumber @xmath26 .",
    "the term @xmath30 is the rate of energy per unit mass and unit wavenumber dissipated at @xmath26 by the microscopic viscosity , while @xmath31 represent the rate of energy per unit mass and unit wavenumber transferred to wavenumbers _ other _ than @xmath26 .",
    "analogous interpretations apply to equation ( 2 ) which describes the temperature fluctuations field .    as stated above , we are interested in stationary turbulence .",
    "thus , in equations ( 1)(3 ) we set the time derivatives of the spectral functions equal to zero .",
    "following cgc ( 1987 ) , we assume that    @xmath32 which equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) show to be equivalent to the assumption :    @xmath33 for equation ( 7 ) to be satisfied , the velocity and temperature fluctuations , at any @xmath26 , must be in phase .",
    "this is expected to be the case for turbulent convection where the temperature plays the role of an _ active scalar _ whose fluctuations _ drive _ the velocity fluctuations .",
    "we adopt the simplifying assumption that the transfer terms in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describe transfer from small to large wavenumbers only ( from large spatial scales to small ones ) .",
    "while justified in three dimensional turbulence where energy flows predominantly from large to small scales , this simplifying assumption neglects non - local interactions ( in @xmath26 space ) that give rise to reverse transfer ( backscatter ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath34 the wavenumber corresponding to the largest eddy , we shall represent the transfer as    @xmath35 where    @xmath36 is the mean squared turbulent vorticity and @xmath37 is the turbulent viscosity at wavenumber @xmath26 , exerted by all eddies of smaller size ( larger @xmath26 ) .",
    "as such , it is expressed as an integral with limits @xmath26 and @xmath38 .",
    "we shall return later to the definition of the integrand .",
    "similarly ,    @xmath39 where    @xmath40 is the analog to the mean squared turbulent vorticity and @xmath41 is the turbulent conductivity at wavenumber @xmath26 exerted by all eddies of smaller size ( larger @xmath26 ) . with these closures ,",
    "we obtain by integrating equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 )    @xmath42 and    @xmath43 the last two equations allow us to express the spectral function @xmath44 in terms of @xmath45 .",
    "we obtain    @xmath46 with    @xmath47 @xmath48 where a prime denotes a differentiation with respect to @xmath26 . substituting equation ( 14 ) in equation ( 7 ) yields    @xmath49 thus",
    ", once @xmath45 is known so are @xmath44 and @xmath10 , implying that one needs to solve only for the spectral function @xmath45 . in order to do so ,",
    "let us return to equation ( 12 ) and express @xmath10 in terms of @xmath45 using equation ( 17 ) .",
    "we obtain    @xmath50 where @xmath0 is the shorthand abbreviation    @xmath51 whose dimension are inverse time .",
    "the combination @xmath52 plays , in equation ( 18 ) , the role of the inverse of the timescale controlling the energy input into the turbulence at wavenumber @xmath26 from the source ( buoyancy in the present case ) .",
    "more specifically , the _ net rate of energy input _ from the source per unit mass and unit wavenumber , at @xmath26 , is @xmath53 .",
    "it is obvious , from equation ( 19 ) , that @xmath0 depends on the _ source _ ( buoyancy ) and on the _ turbulent state_. thus , it conforms with the requirements discussed in  1 . in what follows",
    "we show that equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) allow us to express @xmath0 in terms of the turbulent viscosity @xmath37 .",
    "first , differentiate equation ( 18 ) with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the result is    @xmath54 next , use equations ( 15 ) , ( 20 ) and the definition of y(k ) , equation(9 ) , to get    @xmath55 with the help of equation ( 19 ) , we transform equation ( 21 ) into a second order algebraic equation for @xmath56 :    @xmath57 whose positive solution is    @xmath58 we adopt a relation between @xmath41 and @xmath37    @xmath59 so that , as in cgc ( 1987 ) , @xmath60 equals the constant @xmath61 for large pecle numbers , @xmath62 , while @xmath63 , for small @xmath64 . using equation ( 24 ) to express",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 in terms of @xmath67 , equation ( 23 ) now takes the form    @xmath68 with    @xmath69 and    @xmath70 with this @xmath56 , @xmath0 of equation ( 19 ) becomes    @xmath71 thus , we succeeded in expressing @xmath0 in terms of the turbulent viscosity @xmath37 , even though the latter _ is still unspecified_.      in order to solve equation ( 18 ) ( or equivalently equation ( 20 ) ) we need an additional relation between the turbulent viscosity @xmath37 and the spectral function @xmath45 . without loss of generality , @xmath37 can be written as    @xmath72 where @xmath73 has the dimensions of an inverse time . in order to determine @xmath73 let us focus on its physical meaning .",
    "differentiation of equation ( 29 ) yields that the turbulent viscosity contributed by eddies in the wavenumber interval @xmath74 is    @xmath75 thus , @xmath73 is proportional to the inverse of the eddy - correlation timescale at wavenumber @xmath26 , or heuristically , the inverse of the timescale for the eddy breakup .",
    "the eddy is damped because of two processes : interaction with the turbulent viscosity and the interaction with the source ( microscopic viscosity is not considered here since in stars @xmath76 ) .",
    "one can envisage the eddy as being `` scattered '' by `` collisions '' with the smaller eddies ( turbulent viscosity ) and by the source that drives energy into the eddy .",
    "the effective rate for the breakup ( the inverse of the correlation timescale ) will be taken to be the sum of the rates for the two processes as if they were operating independently : @xmath77 , plus the sum of the rates for each process which is now affected by the other . between `` collisions '' due to one process",
    "there is a random walk due to `` collisions '' of the other process .",
    "thus , these last two rates are @xmath78 and @xmath79 . summing up the four rates we obtain    @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a proportionality constant , determined by the normalization of @xmath82 in the inertial range .",
    "in this range equations ( 20 ) , ( 29 ) and ( 31 ) yield    @xmath83 while equation ( 18 ) results in    @xmath84 with @xmath85 where    @xmath86 is the energy rate per unit mass supplied to the turbulence from the driving source at all wavenumbers smaller than @xmath26 . combined together , equations ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) imply that    @xmath87 this should coincide with @xmath82 corresponding to the kolmogorov spectral function    @xmath88 thus , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the kolmogorov constant .",
    "we used here the same normalization with respect to @xmath90 as was used in cm ( 1991 ) .    with the definition of @xmath73 , equation ( 31 ) ,",
    "the model equations can be solved for @xmath45 , and consequently for @xmath44 and @xmath91 .",
    "we introduce for notational convenience ( following the convention of cgc ( 1987 ) ) the rate @xmath92 defined by    @xmath93 in the model for large scale turbulence of canuto & goldman ( 1985 ) @xmath94 was identified with @xmath95 , neglecting the role of the turbulence . in cgc ( 1987 )",
    "@xmath96 was used , neglecting the role of the source .",
    "here , @xmath94 depends both on @xmath95 and on @xmath97 , as seen from equations ( 31 ) and ( 38 ) , so it depends both on the source and on the turbulence . at @xmath34 , @xmath98 and therefore is @xmath99 times larger than in cgc ( 1987 ) . for high values of @xmath26 ( practically few times @xmath34 ) @xmath100 .",
    "it is of interest to note that the inverse of the timescale for two - times velocity correlation according to the dia model , indeed conforms to the present definition of @xmath94 ( see figures 3 and 4 in canuto & battaglia 1988 ) . in particular at @xmath34 it is indeed @xmath101 .      from equations ( 29 ) and ( 38 ) we have    @xmath102 and equations ( 20 ) and ( 38 ) lead to    @xmath103 combining equations ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) and ( 9 ) yields the differential equation for @xmath92    @xmath104 with @xmath0 and @xmath73 defined as functionals of @xmath92 through equations ( 28 ) and ( 31 ) , respectively . a solution for @xmath92 will also yield these two rates , as well as the spectral function @xmath45 and the mean squared turbulent vorticity @xmath82 .",
    "the main objective of this work is the computation of the turbulent convective flux    @xmath105 here @xmath106 is the turbulent velocity in the flux direction , @xmath107 is the temperature fluctuation , and the overline denotes ensemble averaging .",
    "the dimensionless convective flux @xmath108 is determined by equations ( 12 ) and ( 34 ) to be    @xmath109 the value of @xmath110 will be determined by using the fact that @xmath111 increases with @xmath26 and reaches its asymptotic value already in the inertial range .",
    "thus , we shall follow the solution of @xmath92 and the corresponding @xmath111 , from @xmath34 up to to the inertial range , until @xmath111 saturates to @xmath110 . from equations ( 34 ) , ( 38 ) and ( 40 ) we find    @xmath112 thus , once @xmath92 is obtained , @xmath111 is determined too .",
    "turn now to the equation ( 41 ) which is a first order differential equation for @xmath92 and thus a boundary value is required for a unique solution .",
    "below we find the value of @xmath113 .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is determined by the width of the layer @xmath114 ,    @xmath115 with @xmath116 . since by definition @xmath117 and @xmath118 , equations ( 39 ) , and ( 40 )",
    "imply that    @xmath119 and    @xmath120 the last two equations together with equation ( 28 ) determine @xmath113    @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the solution of    @xmath123 with    @xmath124 where @xmath5 is the dimensionless product of the rayleigh and prandtl numbers    @xmath125 @xmath5 , or more precisely @xmath126 , is a measure of the convective efficiency . with the determination of @xmath113 , equation ( 41 ) can be solved numerically to yield @xmath92 for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "since we deal with stellar interiors for which @xmath127 , we take in all the equations the limit of @xmath128 .",
    "physically this means that the wavenumber at which the rate of dissipation by the microscopic viscosity becomes equal to @xmath129 , is much larger than @xmath34 , so that the spectrum exhibits an inertial range over many decades of @xmath26 . for the limit of @xmath128 , appropriate for stellar interiors , equation ( 49 )",
    "yields an analytic solution for @xmath122 as function of @xmath5 ,    @xmath130 implying that    @xmath131 with    @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "we recall that , the turbulent length - scale @xmath114 at a given depth @xmath2 inside a convective region , must also include the thickness @xmath344 of the overshooting layers ( if any ) beyond the formal schwarzschild boundary ( see dantona and mazzitelli 1994 ) . at present",
    ", the @xmath344 phenomenon has not yet been fully quantified in a reliable way ( umezu 1995 ) even though the underlying equations have been derived ( canuto 1993 ) .",
    "however , empirical evidence from comparisons between stellar models constructed with local convection theories , and observations of intermediate mass main sequence stars in young open clusters , suggests quite stringent limits on the extent of the @xmath344 , namely , @xmath345 ( stothers & chin 1992 ) . lacking a formal theory , we shall write    @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the pressure scale height at the upper boundary of the convective layer determined by the schwarzschild criterion and @xmath348 , which should not exceed @xmath349 , can be regarded as a _ fine - tuning _ parameter .",
    "we stress that the role of @xmath348 in the cm and in the present models is _ radically _ different from the role of the parameter @xmath3 in the mlt model where @xmath350 .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 is a free adjustable parameter through which modelists try to capture all the physical uncertainties ( e. g. opacities , convection , thermodynamics etc . ) relevant to the evaluation of the effective temperatures of stars .",
    "unfortunately , not only does this procedure seriously hinder the predictive power of stellar modeling ( @xmath3 is determined _ a posteriori _ ) , but the fit to the observed surface temperature does not automatically guarantee that also the _ internal temperature profile _ is correct . in this context , it is worth noting that baturin & mironova ( 1995 ) and monteiro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have recently shown that the solar internal temperature profiles predicted by the cm model are in better agreement with helio - seismological data than those derived from the mlt .",
    "moreover , gabriel ( 1995 ) has shown that the mlt could be made to predict a cm - like internal temperature profile , provided that @xmath3 is _ forced to vary inside the convective region _ , in a manner that represents an a posteriori fitting .",
    "this quite clearly shows that a ) the mlt has no predictive power and b ) the degree of artificiality that is required to make the mlt yield results that the cm model produces quite naturally .",
    "the parameter @xmath348 , on the other hand , quantifies a well identified _ physical process _",
    ", the convective overshooting @xmath344 and , as seen in the following , in the present model , only a marginal amount of tuning is allowed anyhow .    finally , the convective flux in table 1 is normalized to a value of the kolmogorov constant of @xmath351 , as in the cm model . since recent experimental data suggest higher values of @xmath90 ( up to @xmath352 ) , we employed for the stellar modeling a fiducial value of @xmath353 in the fit - formula , equation ( 75 ) . since , as discussed in  4.1 , the convective flux scales as @xmath354 , the flux used is a factor of @xmath355 larger than the numerical values in table 1 . in mazzitelli",
    "et al . ( 1995 ) @xmath356 was used .",
    "using the aton code , and updating the low ",
    "t opacities according to alexander and ferguson ( 1994 ) , we obtained a fit to the observed solar radius and luminosity at an age @xmath357 gyr ( bahcall 1989 ) , and with a metal abundance z=0.0175 ( grevesse and noels 1993 ) , with y@xmath3580.27 and @xmath359 .",
    "the latter corresponds to a very small amount of overshooting of a _ few kilometers _ , and is in full accordance with the observational limits of stothers & chin ( 1992 ) . on the other hand , had we employed the original cm model the required value would have been @xmath360 which is a borderline value . to find the maximal variance in @xmath361 allowed by the @xmath348 parameter , we computed two solar models with the borderline values @xmath362 and @xmath363 . the difference in @xmath361 between these last two models turned out to be @xmath3644% .",
    "figure 5 shows the internal profiles of the dimensionless temperature gradient , @xmath365 , in the region of the overadiabaticity peak for solar models computed with the present , the cm and mlt models ( for the mlt model @xmath366 ) .",
    "the results of the present model are very similar to those of the cm model but are quite different from the mlt results .",
    "the similarity of the results of the present and cm models , in spite of the difference ( factor @xmath367 ) in the value of the convective flux for intermediate and low convective efficiencies , can be readily understood . in the more external convective layers",
    ", the density is quite low ( @xmath368 ) , and @xmath369 .",
    "the turbulent flux is also quite low , and convective energy transfer is very inefficient .",
    "most of the flux in this region is therefore carried by radiation , and the temperature gradient sticks to the radiative one . in deeper convective layers , where @xmath319 , @xmath5 and @xmath114 are larger",
    ", convection begins to be efficient and the value of the temperature gradient is determined by the turbulent convective flux .",
    "however , for @xmath5 values such that log @xmath370 , the new fluxes are very close to the cm ones , and so is the resulting temperature gradient .",
    "the vicinity of the gradient peak , @xmath371 , is close to the @xmath5 value where the present and cm models differ the most ( see fig .",
    ", this is the region where we can expect some sizable difference between the temperature profiles , as figure 5 indeed shows .    because of the similarity of the results from the present and the cm models , the experimental benchmark provided by helioseismological data can not discriminate between the two models ( antia and basu 1995 ) .",
    "however , on the basis of stellar modeling , we stress that the new fluxes require a lower value of @xmath348 to fit the sun , which is more in agreement with the results of stothers & chin . since the low ",
    "t radiative opacities are probably still slightly underestimated , and larger opacities require a larger @xmath348 to fit the sun , we prefer the present new fluxes over the original cm values .",
    "the reason is that the latter , once the updated values of low  t opacities become available , could require values of @xmath348 larger than allowed by the observational upper limit on overshooting .    as a further check ,",
    "we have also applied the new fluxes to the computation of evolutionary tracks and isochrones for stars with @xmath372 and @xmath373 .",
    "the isochrones are shown in figure 6 , together with the fiducial sequence of the globular cluster m68 .",
    "details on the computations of both tracks and isochrones , on the observational to theoretical correlations , as well as the chemistry , reddening and distance modulus for m68 can be found in mazzitelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . here",
    "we simply recall that the apparent `` kinks '' in the isochrones are a true physical feature , which is expected and explained within the cm framework , and which exists also in the present model .",
    "the age of the cluster is in the range @xmath374 gyr , somewhat younger than the @xmath375 gyr found with the cm fluxes , which itself is younger than the @xmath376 gyr derived within the mlt . whether this difference is significant for solving the age conflict of globular clusters with the age of the universe , following from the recent determinations of high values of @xmath377 ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 , pierce et al .",
    "1994 ) , is beyond the purposes of the present paper .",
    "this point will be discussed elsewhere ( canuto et al . 1996 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the application of the convective fluxes of the present model to stellar structure does not alter appreciably the main results of the cm model .",
    "nevertheless , the new model is preferable on two grounds . from the theoretical viewpoint",
    ", it determines the rate of input of energy from buoyancy to the turbulence in a more physically consistent manner . from the astrophysical point of view , it requires a smaller extent of overshooting , which is in better agreement with recent observational results .",
    "we have presented a selfconsistent model for turbulent convection based on a simplified treatment of the non - linear interactions among the eddies .",
    "the important novel feature of the present model is the formulation of a selfconsistent rate for energy input from the _ source _ ( buoyancy ) into the turbulence , which depends both on the source parameters and on the _ turbulence _ itself .",
    "this represents an improvement compared to the cm model where the rate of energy input was the growth rate of the _ linear _ unstable modes .",
    "the focus of the present model is on the selfconsistent rate of energy input at the expense of a less complete treatment of the non - linear eddy interactions .",
    "the latter is much simpler than in the cm model and describes transfer only from small to large wavenumbers .",
    "this representation neglects non - local ( in @xmath26 space ) interactions between the eddies that lead to a reverse transfer ( backscatter ) that are included in the cm model .",
    "we have explored the model for a wide range of convective efficiencies and computed , numerically , the dimensionless convective flux , the turbulent squared velocity and the root mean squared turbulent pressure , as functions of the convective efficiency @xmath5 .",
    "the results were fitted by analytical formulae with precision better than @xmath333 over the range @xmath378 . the turbulent viscosity in the model is already given by an analytic expression .",
    "the convective flux , is larger than that of the mlt for high convective efficiencies and lower than it for low convective efficiencies .",
    "this general behavior is similar to that of the cm model .",
    "the high @xmath5 fluxes are very close to those predicted by the cm model but the intermediate and lower @xmath5 fluxes are larger than those of the cm model .",
    "it is of interest to note that even the very simple cgc ( 1987 ) model shares the same qualitative behaviour of the convective flux relative to that of the mlt flux , as function of the convective efficiency .",
    "the fact that three models differing in their treatment of the energy input rate and in the modeling of the nonlinear transfer , still yield the same behaviour is quite intriguing .",
    "it suggests that accounting for the full turbulence spectrum ( common to all three models ) is far more important than the detailed way in which thye latter is done .",
    "we have applied the new model to the main sequence evolution of a solar model as well as to evolutions of pop ii stars with @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the convective turbulent length scale was taken equal to the depth in the convective zone , as in the cm model .",
    "the results are generally similar to those of the cm model .",
    "however , the new model has the advantage that the overshooting required to fit the solar model is smaller than in the cm model .",
    "also , the ages of globular clusters are smaller than the corresponding ages in the cm model by @xmath379 gyr , which may help alleviate a possible conflict between the ages of globular clusters and a high value of @xmath377 .",
    "as already noted in  5 , the similarity between the temperature profiles for the solar model , predicted by the present and the cm models , renders the models practically indistinguishable by helioseismological data ( antia & basu 1995 ) .",
    "the situation is similar with regard to solar atmosphere modeling ( kupka 1995 ) .",
    "however , atmospheres of cool stars are expected to yield observable differences between the two models ( kupka 1995 ) .    from the theoretical perspective ,",
    "a more complete model is one that incorporates a selfconsistent rate of energy input while keeping the non - linear interactions in their full generality , as done within the cm model .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "finally , the present and the cm models are based on two - point correlations of the turbulent quantities .",
    "this methodology , preferred by the physics community , yields information about the spectral properties of the turbulence . yet",
    ", its applicability to inhomogeneous and anisotropic cases is limited .",
    "an alternative approach , based on one - point correlation functions , is widely used in the engineering community and can handle anisotropy and inhomogeneity .",
    "while the spectral information is lost in this reynolds stress formalism , the method is easy to apply to non - local and space - dependent problems and has the potential to treat stellar convective overshooting ( canuto 1993 ) .",
    "the method has already been successfully applied to the planetary boundary layer ( pbl ) which is the seat of strong convection ( canuto et al .",
    "1994a ) as well as to study the interaction between shear , vorticity and buoyancy at the surface of the sun ( canuto et al .",
