    "bacteria and other microscopic swimmers live in a world of low reynolds number , in which viscous effects dominate over inertia  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the drag forces acting on a swimmer are much greater than the forces necessary to achieve the observed accelerations of these swimmers . at the limit of zero reynolds number ,",
    "the sum of the net drag force and any other external forces , such as buoyancy , must vanish .",
    "therefore , the physics underlying the swimming strategies of microorganisms is markedly different from that of large organisms such as fish .",
    "for example , in the absence of inertia , the diffusion of viscous shear waves is essentially instantaneous .",
    "thus , the flows induced by a swimming creature s motions start and stop immediately when the creature s movements start and stop . this phenomenon is closely related to the  scallop theorem , \" of purcell @xcite , which states that time reversible strokes in a newtonian fluid , such as water , can not produce net swimming  @xcite , because there is an equal and opposite net translation for corresponding forward and backward stroke motions . as a result ,",
    "swimming microorganisms use strokes with a clear time direction , such as the traveling wave patterns on the flexible flagella of mammalian sperm , or the rigid - body rotation of the helical flagellar filaments of _ escherichia coli_. early theoretical work elucidated the basic principles of swimming at zero reynolds numbers in a newtonian fluid .",
    "for example , taylor calculated the swimming speed of an infinite two - dimensional sheet as a function of the amplitude , wave number , and wave speed of a traveling wave on the sheet  @xcite .",
    "he also did the same calculation for an infinite cylindrical filament  @xcite .",
    "these calculations showed that the swimming speed is proportional to the wave speed , as expected from dimensional analysis .",
    "since the shape and speed of the waves on the sheet or filament in these calculations are independent of the load , the swimming speed is independent of the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "in other work , various groups have calculated how viscous forces and forces internal to a flagellum determine the shape of flexible filaments actuated at one end  @xcite or actuated by internal motors distributed along the filament  @xcite .",
    "all the calculations just mentioned apply to newtonian fluids .",
    "however , swimming microorganisms often encounter elastic fluids .",
    "for example , mammalian sperm must swim through viscoelastic mucus in the female reproductive tract  @xcite ; the bacterium _",
    "helicobacter pylori _ must swim through mucus lining the stomach  @xcite ; and spirochetes must burrow through connective tissue in the course of infection  @xcite .",
    "the theory of swimming in non - newtonian fluids is much less developed than the newtonian case .",
    "fulford , katz , and powell extended the resistive force theory of gray and hancock  @xcite to the case of a linear maxwell model for viscoelasticity , and found no change in the swimming speed compared to the newtonian case  @xcite .",
    "more recently , lauga emphasized that since swimming speed depends nonlinearly on wave amplitude , a realistic treatment of swimming in a non - newtonian medium should include a nonlinear model for the viscoelastic medium  @xcite .",
    "lauga investigated several nonlinear fading memory models and found that for a given wave pattern on a two - dimensional sheet , viscoelastic effects slow the swimmer relative to its speed in a newtonian liquid  @xcite .    in our previous work , we calculated the swimming velocity of an infinite filament with a prescribed waveform in the upper convected maxwell model  @xcite , a simple nonlinear model for a viscoelastic material with fading memory  @xcite .",
    "we also studied the effect of the viscoelastic medium on the shape of a beating filament described by a simple sliding filament model  @xcite , and showed how altered beating shapes affect swimming velocities . in the current paper",
    ", we give a more detailed account of our calculation of the swimming speed of an infinite filament with a prescribed waveform .",
    "we refine our previous calculation by including the effects of solvent viscosity with the oldroyd - b model for a nonlinearly viscoelastic polymer solution . as an application of our calculations",
    ", we examine how the scallop theorem is spoiled in a nonlinearly viscoelastic fluid at zero reynolds number . in this paper",
    "we consider prescribed shapes of beating patterns . in actual swimmers with beating filaments",
    ", the shape is determined by the interaction of filament structure with hydrodynamic forces , which we address in another publication  @xcite . here",
    "we take the point of view that the beating pattern is already known ( for example , from direct observation ) and ask what the consequences are for swimming properties .",
    "we restrict our discussion to time - periodic motions and associated flows , corresponding to repetitive swimming actions that can be employed to move an arbitrarily large distance by a self - contained organism . for these time - periodic motions , the associated flows will have both time - periodic and constant components . only the constant ,",
    "time - averaged component produces net translation over many cycles .",
    "we close this introduction with a summary of the structure of this paper . in sec .",
    "[ models ] we review the oldroyd - b model and how it naturally arises for a material with fading memory .",
    "then , in the next section , we calculate the flow fields induced by a helical traveling wave on an infinite cylinder .",
    "we work to second order in the deflection of the cylinder , and deduce the time - averaged swimming speed . in sec .",
    "[ scallopthm ] we explore the ramifications of our calculation for the scallop theorem , and show quantitatively how a reversible stroke pattern leads to propulsion .",
    "section  [ discuss ] is the conclusion .",
    "finally , in the appendix we calculate the viscoelastic force per unit length to first order acting on a filament with transverse or longitudinal ( compressional ) traveling waves .",
    "since we consider the zero reynolds number regime , inertia is irrelevant and the dynamics of an incompressible medium is governed by force balance , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the pressure associated with incompressibility , @xmath2 ; @xmath3 is the flow velocity ; and @xmath4 is the deviatoric stress tensor . the particular character of a medium is determined by the constitutive relation , which relates the stress to the strain and rates - of - strain . in this paper",
    "we consider dilute polymer solutions , in which the stress relaxes to the stress of a newtonian viscous fluid over a time scale @xmath5 .",
    "a simple constitutive relation for a dilute polymer solution is the single - relaxation - time maxwell model : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 label cartesian coordinates , @xmath9 is viscosity , and @xmath10 is the strain rate .",
    "this constitutive relation is valid to first order in deformation .",
    "however , the swimming velocity of a prescribed motion is second order in the deformation  @xcite . to see why ,",
    "consider a traveling wave of amplitude @xmath11 on an infinite cylindrical filament ( fig .",
    "[ taylorcylinder ] ) .",
    "the swimming velocity may be represented as a power series in @xmath11 .",
    "replacing @xmath11 with @xmath12 changes the sign of the first order contribution to the velocity . on the other hand , changing the sign of @xmath11 amounts to translating the filament by half of a wavelength , and therefore yields no change in the time - averaged swimming velocity .",
    "thus we conclude that the swimming velocity is quadratic in @xmath11 to leading order , and therefore nonlinear corrections to eq .",
    "( [ mm ] ) will be important for the study of swimming in a viscoelastic medium  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to recall why the constitutive relation  ( [ mm ] ) is inapplicable for large deformations .",
    "first , note that the maxwell constitutive relation does not respect galilean invariance .",
    "this defect is easily fixed by replacing the partial time derivative of the stress , @xmath13 , with the material derivative , @xmath14 . however , this modified constitutive relation is still unsuitable for working beyond first order in deformation because it is sensitive to the overall orientation of the material .",
    "for example , consider a steady - state flow , for which ( [ mm ] ) predicts that @xmath15 .",
    "now place the medium on a slowly rotating turntable  @xcite . since viscous forces are much greater than the fictitious forces arising from rotation , the relation between stress and strain rate in the rotating material is the same as that in the stationary material , to an excellent approximation  @xcite : @xmath16 , where the prime denotes the quantities for the rotating material . on the other hand , the components @xmath17 are time - dependent , because @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a time - dependent rotation matrix .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ mm ] ) can not hold for the primed quantities , even with the partial time derivative replaced with the material derivative .    in general , changes in the components @xmath20 due to motion of the basis vectors should not enter the constitutive relation .",
    "the formulation of rheological equations of state requires a time derivative that does not depend on the choice of basis  @xcite .",
    "any constitutive relation that reflects the small magnitudes of fictitious forces must be formulated in terms of time derivatives of stress or strain that transform homogeneously under change of coordinates .",
    "there are many different ways to construct a time derivative of the stress tensor that is insensitive to the rate of change of the basis vectors . in the following we present one way to do so which leads to the nonlinear viscoelastic model used in the rest of the paper .     due to the small magnitudes of fictitious forces",
    ", the constitutive relation should be insensitive not only to global rotations such as that of the turntable described above , but also to local rotations and translations of fluid elements .",
    "one way to enforce this more general condition is to express the time derivatives in terms of coordinates which track fluid elements .",
    "suppose @xmath21 are convective coordinates , with @xmath22 the position at time @xmath23 of the particle with cartesian coordinates @xmath21 at the initial time .",
    "convective coordinates are also known as lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the basis vectors associated with convective coordinates are @xmath24 , and the stress takes the form @xmath25 , or more simply @xmath26 . for cartesian coordinates , whether an index is raised or lowered has no significance ; however , for general coordinates , raised indices signify contravariant coordinates , and lowered indices signify covariant coordinates  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 the second two terms in eq .",
    "( [ dtaudt ] ) arise from the the dependence of the basis vectors on time and therefore they can not enter the constitutive relation . to eliminate the spurious time - dependence , define the upper - convected time derivative using convective coordinates : @xmath29 in coordinate - free form , the upper - convected derivative is @xmath30 it follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ uc - convcoords ] ) that the components of @xmath31 in a general coordinate system transform homogeneously even under a time - dependent change of coordinates .",
    "the upper - convected time derivative is just one way of many to construct a time derivative of the stress tensor that is insensitive to the rate of change of the basis vectors .",
    "for example , if we consider the covariant components @xmath20 of the stress tensor in the convected - coordinate basis , a different natural derivative emerges : the lower - convected derivative  @xcite .",
    "the choice of one particular convective derivative over another can not be justified on symmetry grounds alone , but must be made using information from experiments or the continuum limit of a microscopic model .",
    "for example , a commonly used model for dilute polymer solutions is the oldroyd - b model  @xcite .",
    "we will use this model in this paper . in the oldroyd - b model , the polymer component is represented by the upper convected maxwell model , which is the maxwell constitutive equation ( [ mm ] ) with the time derivative replaced by the upper - convected time derivative .",
    "the appearance of the upper - convected time derivative , rather than some other form insensitive to rates of change of basis vectors , can be justified by appealing to a microscopic model of polymer stresses arising from hookean dumbbells  @xcite .",
    "the solvent is represented by the usual newtonian constitutive relation for a viscous fluid .",
    "thus , the deviatoric stress for the solution is @xmath32 where the total viscosity @xmath33 is the sum of polymer and solvent viscosities .",
    "note that if a patch of fluid undergoes a spatially uniform rotation or translation , due to the covariant nature of this equation , within the patch the constitutive relation is insensitive to the motion . in ( [ oldroydb ] ) , if the solvent viscosity is ignored ( @xmath34 ) , the oldroyd - b fluid reduces to the upper convected maxwell fluid , and if there is no polymer ( @xmath35 ) the oldroyd - b fluid reduces to a newtonian fluid .",
    "the model for the oldroyd - b fluid predicts realistic elastic and first normal stress effects as long as elongational flows are not large ; however , it does not capture shear - thinning or yield - stress behaviors observed in some non - newtonian fluids .",
    "the oldroyd - b model has been used to describe boger fluids @xcite .",
    "we use the oldroyd - b fluid as an example .",
    "the choice of constitutive relation ultimately depends on accurately modeling the properties of particular real - life fluids and flows .",
    "we note that in the case of an infinite sheet , lauga examined a number of nonlinear models , including finite extensible nonlinear elastic models which remedy the limitations of oldroyd - b in elongational flows , and found that the swimming speed was not affected by the choice of constitutive model  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the solution to the problem of an infinitely long cylinder with prescribed beating motion in a viscoelastic fluid .",
    "we obtain the swimming velocity in a nonlinearly viscoelastic fluid , and find that in general it is decreased relative to the swimming velocity in a newtonian fluid .",
    "our results are different from the results of fulford , katz , and powell @xcite , who used the constitutive relation  ( [ mm ] ) to find that a filament with prescribed beating pattern swims at the same speed in viscous and linearly viscoelastic fluids .",
    "our results are in broad agreement with those of lauga , @xcite who solved the corresponding problem of an infinite sheet with traveling - wave displacements .",
    "figure  ( [ taylorcylinder ] ) shows a snapshot of the swimming filament .",
    "the beating motion is represented by a transverse traveling wave .",
    "this motion induces flow . to calculate the swimming velocity",
    ", we work in the frame of the swimmer and calculate the @xmath36-component of the flow far from the swimmer . as argued above , the swimming velocity is second order in the amplitude of the deflections of the filament ; therefore we must calculate the @xmath36-component of the flow to second order .",
    "we calculate the average speed over one period of the motion of the filament .      in this subsection",
    "we define the deformation of the filament , prescribe the boundary conditions , and solve for the flow velocity to first order in the deformation of the filament .",
    "we consider a cylinder with radius @xmath37 , with its axis lying along the @xmath38 direction .",
    "for the undisturbed , straight cylinder , material points on the surface are parameterized by @xmath39 , the distance along the axis , and the angle @xmath40 ( see fig . [ taylorcylinder ] ) .",
    "note that these coordinates are convective coordinates for the filament surface .",
    "for a transverse planar traveling wave , the deformation of the cylinder is given by prescribing the position @xmath41 of the centerline of the cylinder .",

    "enforcing inextensibility leads to motion of the filament surface in the @xmath44 direction with amplitude of order @xmath45 ; this type of longitudinal motion would give rise to corrections to the swimming velocity of order @xmath46 , higher order than the results we report in this paper .",
    "for technical ease , we solve for arbitrary motion by decomposing into a linear superposition of traveling waves ; therefore it is sufficient to assume that the prescribed shape change in eq .",
