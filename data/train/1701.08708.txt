    "recently , the present authors and their co - workers@xcite developed a method for constructing kohn ",
    "sham ( ks ) exchange - correlation potentials , @xmath0 , from electronic wave functions for nondegenerate ground states that are pure - state @xmath1-representable.@xcite in this method , @xmath0 is generated by iterating an analytic expression that relates this potential to the interacting two - electron reduced density matrix ( 2-rdm ) of the system .",
    "refs .   and",
    "describe two implementations of our technique based on slightly different but equivalent expressions for @xmath0 , ref .",
    "presents a general approach for deriving such expressions , whereas refs .   and elaborate on the implications .",
    "since the two published variants@xcite of our method are interchangeable , we will refer to them collectively as the ryabinkin ",
    "staroverov ( rks ) procedure , after the authors of ref .  .",
    "in the special case of hartree  fock ( hf ) wave functions , the rks procedure reduces to the method of refs . and .",
    "the rks method is _ not _ a ks inversion technique , that is , it does not focus on finding the ks potential that reproduces a given _ ab initio _ electron density @xmath2 .",
    "the ks inversion problem is ill - conditioned@xcite and its solution is not unique when the ks equations are solved in a finite one - electron basis set.@xcite the objective of the rks method is to approximate the basis - set - limit @xmath0 of the system when both wave - function and ks calculations are done using a finite basis set .",
    "rks potentials are obtained from the 2-rdm via an analytic expression for @xmath0 that is exact in a complete ( infinite ) basis set but not in a finite one . as a consequence , they are unambiguous and uniform , but the density @xmath3 generated by an rks potential is exactly equal to @xmath2 only in the basis - set limit .",
    "this is to be contrasted with ks inversion techniques,@xcite where the requirement that @xmath3 match @xmath2 in _ any _ basis set can result in potentials that oscillate , diverge , and look nothing like the @xmath0 of the basis - set limit @xmath2 for the same system.@xcite thus , ks inversion and rks methods pose different questions and give different answers in finite basis sets .    in our experience ,",
    "the rks procedure works best for large uncontracted basis sets such as the universal gaussian basis set ( ugbs).@xcite for general - purpose basis sets such as cc - pvxz,@xcite cc - pcvxz,@xcite and 6 - 311 g * , it often works well , but sometimes produces deformed potentials or even fails to converge ( see examples below ) .",
    "here we propose a modification to the rks method that eliminates all such problems , increases the uniformity of potentials obtained in various gaussian basis sets , and substantially improves the accuracy of potentials generated in small basis sets with respect to the basis - set limit .",
    "the exact expression for @xmath4 that lies at the heart of the rks method was obtained@xcite by combining two local energy balance equations derived within the ks and _ ab initio _ wave - function formalisms for a given @xmath5-electron system .",
    "these two equations contain the molecular electrostatic potential but differ in all other terms .",
    "the fact that both equations describe the same system is expressed by the condition @xmath6 when one local energy balance equation is subtracted from the other , the electrostatic potential drops out and we obtain the following intermediate result : @xmath7 where each quantity is a function of @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the potential of the exchange - correlation hole charge@xcite derived from the interacting 2-rdm , @xmath10 is the average local ks orbital energy , in which @xmath11 are the spatial parts of ks spin - orbitals , @xmath12 are their eigenvalues , and @xmath13 the next quantity , defined by @xmath14 is the _ ab initio _ average local electron energy,@xcite in which @xmath15 are the eigenfunctions of the generalized fock operator , @xmath16 are their eigenvalues , and @xmath17 is the _ ab initio _ electron density .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "extends over all eigenfunctions @xmath15 whose number is equal to the number of one - electron basis - set functions .",
    "we choose to write the _ ab initio _ electron density as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the natural orbitals and @xmath20 are their occupation numbers .",
    "the remaining quantities are @xmath21,\\ ] ] the laplacian form of the interacting ( _ ab initio _ ) kinetic - energy density expressed through natural orbitals , and @xmath22,\\ ] ] the laplacian form of the noninteracting ( ks ) kinetic - energy density . note that eq .",
    "is one of an entire class of exact expressions for @xmath4.@xcite    for reasons discussed below , the rks procedure uses _ not _ eq .",
    "but a different expression obtained from eq .   by applying to @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 the identity @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the respective positive - definite form of the kinetic - energy density .",
    "the terms @xmath27 and @xmath28 cancel out because of eq .  , and",
    ".   becomes @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31    equation   is the basis of the rks method . to construct @xmath4 by this technique",
    "one needs to compute all of the terms on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "the terms @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath17 are extracted from an _ ab initio _ wave function , but @xmath34 and @xmath35 are initially unknown because they depend on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which in turn depend on @xmath4 . in refs .   and , we showed that it is possible to simultaneously solve for @xmath4 and the associated ks orbitals by starting with a reasonable initial guess for @xmath11 and @xmath12 and iterating eq .   via the ks equations until the potential @xmath4 becomes self - consistent . in a finite basis set ,",
    "this potential is such that @xmath36 even at convergence .",
    "equations   and are both exact ( ks - compliant ) only when all their right - hand - side ingredients are obtained in a complete basis set .",
    "this is because the two local energy balance equations leading to eq .",
    "were derived by analytically inverting the ks and generalized fock eigenvalue problems,@xcite and analytic inversion of operator eigenvalue problems amounts to employing a complete basis set .",
    "refs .  , , and",
    "demonstrate the dramatic effect of basis - set incompleteness on the inverted ks equation , whereas refs .   and illustrate it for the generalized fock eigenvalue problem .    in a finite basis set , eqs .   and are not even equivalent because eq .",
    ", which links them , does not hold from the start of iterations .",
    "previously we found that iterations of eq .",
    "hardly ever converge , whereas iterations of eq .",
    "converge for many , but not all , standard gaussian basis sets .",
    "we now argue that eq .   works better than eq .   because in eq .   the difference @xmath37 is set to its basis - set - limit value of zero even when @xmath36 , so the resulting finite - basis - set @xmath4 can get closer to the basis - set - limit potential . motivated by this idea , we propose the following improvement upon eq .  .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that all @xmath11 are real . using the lagrange identity@xcite we write @xmath38 recognizing that @xmath39 and dividing eq .",
    "through by @xmath40 we have ( cf .  ref .  )",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 is the von weizscker noninteracting kinetic - energy density and @xmath43 is a quantity which we call the pauli kinetic - energy density ( the name is motivated by ref . ) .",
    "similarly , assuming real natural orbitals and applying the lagrange identity to the product @xmath44 we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 next we substitute eqs .   and into eq .  .",
    "in view of eq .  , the terms @xmath48 and @xmath49 cancel out and we arrive at the following new expression , @xmath50 which is the main result of this work .",
    "just like eqs .   and , eq .   is ks - compliant only in the basis - set - limit . in a finite basis set , it should give a better approximation to the basis - set - limit @xmath4 than eq .   because it sets the quantity @xmath51 to its basis - set - limit value of zero even when @xmath36 .",
    "we will refer to the variant of our method using eq .   as the modified rks ( mrks ) procedure .",
    "the mrks procedure is exactly the same as the original rks method@xcite except that the former uses eq .   in place of eq .  .",
    "therefore , we will not describe the mrks algorithm in detail here but only emphasize the following important points .",
    "the equality @xmath52 plays a key role in the derivation of eqs .   and , but it is not imposed when these equations are solved by iteration .",
    "thus , there is no such thing as a  target density \" in the rks and mrks methods , and the extent to which @xmath53 deviates from @xmath17 at convergence is controlled implicitly through the choice of one - electron basis set . for internal consistency , the rks and mrks procedures use the same one - electron basis set to generate the _ ab initio _ wave function and to solve the ks equations in the iterative part of the algorithm .",
    "the hartree ( coulomb ) contribution to the ks hamiltonian matrix is always computed using @xmath53 ( not @xmath17 ) ; we do it analytically in terms of gaussian basis functions .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath4 are evaluated using saturated gauss  legendre  lebedev numerical integration grids .",
    "we consider @xmath4 converged when the difference between two consecutive ks density matrices drops below 10@xmath54 in the root - mean - square sense .",
    "both the original and modified rks procedures require direct inversion of the iterative subspace@xcite to converge the potential in self - consistent - field ( scf ) iterations ; the mrks procedure typically takes one or two dozen iterations , rks up to a few dozen .",
    "the converged @xmath4 is independent of the initial guess ; ks orbitals and orbital energies from any standard density - functional approximation are adequate as a starting point for systems with a single - reference character . for this work ,",
    "we re - implemented the rks and mrks methods by modifying the scf and multiconfigurational scf links of a more recent version of the gaussian 09 program.@xcite",
    "to demonstrate the practical advantages of eq .   over eq .",
    "we compared exchange - correlated potentials generated by the mrks and rks methods from various atomic and molecular _ ab initio _ wave functions .",
    "the wave functions were of three types : hf , complete active space scf ( casscf ) , and full configuration interaction ( fci ) .",
    "wave functions of each type were obtained using a series of standard gaussian one - electron basis sets varying between minimal ( sto-3 g ) and very large ( ugbs ) .",
    "all basis sets were taken from the basis set exchange database.@xcite    for each wave function , we report three relevant properties : the total interacting kinetic energy @xmath55 the _ ab initio _ exchange - correlation energy @xmath56 and the first ionization energy extracted from the wave function by the extended koopmans theorem@xcite ( ekt ) , @xmath57 . for hf wave functions , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the eigenvalue of the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) . for post - hf wave functions ,",
    "@xmath57 was computed as the largest eigenvalue of the @xmath60 matrix defined in ref .  .",
    "the ekt ionization energies are needed to fix the constant up to which the @xmath4 is defined by eqs .",
    "and .@xcite this is done by shifting the potential vertically so that @xmath61 .    after reducing each _ ab initio _ wave function to a self - consistent @xmath0 , we evaluated the following properties : the total noninteracting kinetic energy @xmath62 the ks exchange - correlation energy @xmath63 where @xmath64 and the integral @xmath65 v_\\text{xc}({\\mathbf{r}})\\,d{\\mathbf{r } } ,   \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] whose purpose will be explained shortly .",
    "the integrals in eqs .  ,  , and were computed analytically , whereas @xmath66 was evaluated numerically .",
    "strictly speaking , the quality of mrks potentials should be judged by their proximity to the basis - set - limit @xmath4 , but since exact exchange - correlation potentials are rarely available , we suggest to use weaker but feasible tests for basis - set completeness .",
    "the first test is the integrated density error @xmath67 where @xmath3 is evaluated at convergence . for a given type of wave function",
    ", @xmath68 is uniquely determined by the basis set used in the mrks procedure .",
    "the premise of the test is that @xmath68 tends to zero as the basis set approaches completeness , so the magnitude of @xmath68 gives some indication of how close the mrks potential is to its basis - set limit .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath68 values have entirely different meanings in ks inversion and rks - type methods .",
    "for instance , @xmath69 a.u .  in a ks inversion procedure indicates that @xmath4 is not converged , whereas in the mrks procedure it signals that the corresponding _ converged _",
    "@xmath4 is not yet close to the basis - set - limit potential ( because an insufficiently large basis set was used ) .",
    "the second test is based on the fact that , for a given density functional @xmath70 $ ] and a density @xmath71 , the corresponding functional derivative @xmath72/\\delta\\rho({\\mathbf{r}})$ ] satisfies the virial relation@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath66 is given by eq .  .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation @xmath74 from zero may be taken as a measure of deviation of a trial potential from @xmath75/\\delta\\rho({\\mathbf{r}})$ ] . as a quality control test ,",
    "@xmath76 is more discriminating than @xmath68 : even visually imperceptible defects of @xmath0 can result in large @xmath77 values , as we showed previously for approximate exchange - only potentials.@xcite note that in refs .   and we studied ks potentials extracted from hf wave functions as approximations to exact - exchange potentials , for which @xmath78 , so we defined @xmath79 and evaluated @xmath80 using the ks ( not hf ) orbitals .",
    "this is why the hf / ugbs values of @xmath77 in this work are different from those reported in refs . and .",
