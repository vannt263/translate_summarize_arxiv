    "<S> we study electronic transport through a one - dimensional array of sites by using a tight binding hamiltonian , whose site - energies are drawn from an chaotic sequence . the correlation degree between these energies </S>",
    "<S> is controlled by a parameter regulating the dynamic lyapunov exponent measuring the degree of chaos . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the effect of chaotic sequences on the localization length , conductance , conductance distribution and wave function , finding evidence of a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at a critical degree of chaos . </S>",
    "<S> the one dimensional metallic phase is characterized by a gaussian conductance distribution and exhibits a peculiar non - selfaveraging .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that one - dimensional systems with uncorrelated disorder behave like insulators because their electronic states tend to localize@xcite . for systems whose length is larger than the electronic localization length the conductance vanishes exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the anderson localization@xcite does not address the effect that correlations have on electronic states in disordered lattices . </S>",
    "<S> short range correlations have been shown to be responsible for low dimensional delocalization behavior in direct experimental realizations using semiconductor superlattices@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such is the behavior of the one - dimensional random - dimer model , where transitions from localized to extended states are found when the fermi energy assumes values belonging to a discrete set of energies@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> extended states have been reported for incommensurate one dimensional systems which can be viewed as long range correlated . </S>",
    "<S> this is known to occur within the harper model@xcite whose the site energies are given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is irrational and @xmath2 is a parameter . below a critical value of @xmath2 extended </S>",
    "<S> states are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> a more general model was introduced by griniasty and fishman@xcite including the harper model as a particular case , describes a one dimensional model where the energy @xmath3 of site @xmath4 is generated by the relation @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting sequence is described as pseudorandom depending on the value of @xmath6 and @xmath7 an irrational number . in this model a mobility edge is found whereupon the system exhibits a metal insulator transition for a threshold value of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> mobility edges in one dimensional systems have also been recently reported in non - periodic kronig - penney potentials correlated over long distances@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here it was shown how to construct site energy sequences , that lead to predetermined localization - delocalization transitions . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , mobility edges have been found experimentally for these systems by microwave transition measurements on waveguides with inserted correlated scatterers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , non - trivial electronic transport properties in low dimensional systems such as certain proteins , and dna chains@xcite have prompted new models involving long range correlated disorder@xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we study electronic transport through a quasi - one dimensional system with site energies obeying a chaotic sequence characterized by a dynamic lyapunov exponent @xmath8 , that gives a measure of the degree of chaos and _ short ranged correlation_. the model of chaotic sequences used here is of much interest since it addresses in a continuos fashion periodic and chaotic sequences of varying dynamic lyapunov exponent with a single control parameter @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter parameter can in turn be related analytically to the dynamic lyapunov exponent , the rate at which information is lost in the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> random sequences are then identified with large values of the dynamic lyapunov exponent were no memory of the previous values is preserved@xcite , while small values of the exponent relate to correlated sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the manner of introducing disorder is reminiscent of that proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite discussed above , where a parameter served to measure the degree of pseudo - randomness . </S>",
    "<S> pseudo - randomness , in this case , is well defined by a sequence of numerical tests in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in relation to anderson localization .    </S>",
    "<S> this work first addresses the chaotic energy sequence recursion and the analytic form of the dynamic lyapunov exponent . </S>",
    "<S> the methods for obtaining reliably the wave function and the localization length as a function of energy follow , along with the computation of the conductance of the system from the green s function . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the localization length grows faster than the length of the system , within a finite energy band , below a critical value of the parameter governing the degree of chaos @xmath9 , indicating delocalized electron behavior . </S>",
    "<S> such a conclusion is supported by studying the conductance as a function of system size , its asymptotic scaling properties , and the localization of the wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance distribution in the extended phase is a narrow gaussian for different realization of the chaotic sequence but its mean fluctuates more strongly with system size in comparison to the distribution width , displaying non - self averaging behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider a tight binding hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor coupling in order to describe one electron moving through a chain of @xmath10 sites @xmath11 where @xmath3 are the site energies and @xmath12 the nearest neighbor coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this chain is attached to semi - infinite leads at each end , whose site energies are equal to @xmath13 , and the hoppings are unity . </S>",
    "<S> the site energies in the sample are generated by the recursive formula ( inspired by the recursion of nazareno , gonzalez and costa ( ngc)@xcite ) @xmath14 \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath9 being the controlling parameter that regulates the dynamic lyapunov exponent . by using the transformation @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a piecewise linear map @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> one can then find an analytic expression for the dynamic lyapunov exponent by applying the relation @xmath17 therefore , for @xmath18 the map is chaotic@xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] we show a bifurcation map corresponding to the formula ( [ eq : recursion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we drew energy values after a transient of 3000 iterations of the recursion formula , which applies to every further computation . </S>",
    "<S> different realizations of the chaotic sequence are generated by initiating the recursion with different initial values .    </S>",
    "<S> bifurcation map corresponding to the recursive relation of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : recursion ] . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence at the threshold oscillates between essentially two values ( 0 and 1 ) , but gradually grows to the full interval ( 0,1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence is only strictly random in the @xmath19 limit@xcite.,width=288 ]    we can distinguish different ranges of values for the parameter @xmath9 : periodic region , for @xmath20 , in which the sequence converges to one fix point ; and chaotic region for @xmath18 , where @xmath3 varies over a fixed interval . </S>",
    "<S> notice that while @xmath9 moves away from @xmath21 ( value at which we obtain an ordered binary array ) the @xmath3-values spread until this variable assumes almost all values in the interval @xmath22 .    to compute the wave function for the tight binding model </S>",
    "<S> , we use the band matrix routines described in ref.@xcite using gaussian elimination and back substitution . diagonalizing by this method one can handle large one dimensional systems reliably , in order to assess the localizing properties of the wave function . on the other hand , both the localization length and the conductance </S>",
    "<S> are more conveniently computed by renormalization procedure that generates the green s function @xmath23^{-1}$ ] through a decimation method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method consists in the elimination of sites along the chain in an iterative fashion , in such a way that we obtain an effective hamiltonian which involves the sites 1 and @xmath24 in the chain , whose site energies are @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the energy correction to the first site due the presence of the other sites in the chain , and @xmath27 is the energy correction to site @xmath24 . these corrections are given in detail in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in order to take into account the leads in the calculation procedure </S>",
    "<S> , we add a self energy correction to site energies @xmath28 and @xmath29@xcite whose value within the band @xmath30 is @xmath31 where @xmath13 is the site energy of the semi - infinite chain representing the incoming and outgoing leads . </S>",
    "<S> once the green s function is calculated , the localization length @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 and the conductance by the two - lead landauer formula , expressing the conductance in terms of the green s function@xcite , @xmath34 @xmath35 being the imaginary part of the self - energy correction described above .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[fig : length ] we plot the localization length as a function of the energy ( referred to the site energies of the semi - infinite leads ) for three different values of the parameter @xmath9 in the vicinity of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows the size of the system @xmath10 demonstrating that @xmath37 within a finite energy range . in this case </S>",
    "<S> two relevant energy ranges are observed due to the nature of the initially binary energy sequence generated ( see fig.[figure1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the localization length grows linearly with the size of the system in the two energy ranges shown .    </S>",

    "<S> these results are shown in fig.[fig : phase5 ] , where no further changes are evident as we increase system sizes above @xmath46 sites . </S>",
    "<S> the figure suggests a clearcut transition between extended states and localized states . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows a running average of the main curves so as to decrease fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of the wavefunction versus the position along the one dimensional chain , as explained above eq.[eq : tb ] led to the same conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> we diagonalized systems of up to @xmath47 sites for different values of the parameter @xmath9 and energy @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction decays exponentially beyond a certain value of the control parameter . for @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction is completely localized below 500 sites .    to show that the average conductance is a good measure of the conductance distribution , </S>",
    "<S> the full distribution of the conductance is obtained as a function of system size and initializing seeds . in fig.[fig : distribution ] we show that the distribution , when sampled for different initializing seeds , is a narrow gaussian ( see inset ) of width 2% of the mean conductance value . on the other hand , as the system size is changed the whole distribution fluctuates within a broader interval of 30% around the mean conductance of fig.[fig : phase5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these two different fluctuational amplitudes imply a non - selfaveraging property of the extended phase of the system rather different from a regular metallic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution in the critical region , on the other hand is broad and requires a much more extensive study in itself .     </S>",
    "<S> conductance distribution in the metallic phase as a function of systems size . </S>",
    "<S> each distribution is generated by changing the seed of the chaotic energy sequence , and they are well defined gaussians ( see inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless changes in length involve larger fluctuations in the mean values.,width=340 ]    as the results show , we obtain a metal - insulator transition for a finite band of states in a one dimensional system with a chaotic sequence of energies . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic character is assessed from the behavior of the localization length with system size , the scaling of the conductance and the behavior of the wavefunction as a function of the chaoticity parameter @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , for the energy sequence used , correlations are present but are not long ranged , so such feature seems sufficient but not necessary for delocalization to occur in the present sense . </S>",
    "<S> one might be tempted to test a model where energies around @xmath50 and @xmath51 are pertubed randomly in the vinicity of those energies , generating a small band of values ( resembling structure of fig.[figure1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , such a model behaves asymptotically localized for arbitrarily small disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we have thoroughly tested this conclusion with the methods described before .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , several physical systems have been reported to be very sensitive to changes in the nature of disorder within the system . among these systems we can mention : the two - dimensional ising model , the problem of ballistic deposition , and random walks @xcite . regarding random walks , it is possible to show that if there is `` determinism '' in the external noise applied to random walks , the resulting walks observe symmetries which are absent when the noise is completely random . </S>",
    "<S> anomalous behavior ensues in the computation of the mean distance versus time .    in the context of ballistic deposition , that serves as a prototype for studies of dynamic scaling phenomena in nonequilibrium growth processes , </S>",
    "<S> the external influences are usually modeled by random noise . </S>",
    "<S> d souza _ et al _ have studied ballistic deposition using different deterministic sources of noise @xcite , and find fluctuations statistically inconsistent with the steady - state distribution and ergodicity i.e. driving the dynamics of the system with different deterministic sources of `` noise '' results in selective sampling of the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> such deterministic noise has been shown to modify the scaling exponents predicted by theory assuming strictly random noise .    </S>",
    "<S> the class of energy sequences addressed here seem to open new possibilities , which rather than sequence correlation , emphasize determinism implicit in chaos . </S>",
    "<S> such determinism seems to play a non - trivial role in combination with the quantum mechanics of localization . </S>",
    "<S> this is a new example of physical systems where deterministic disorder can produce new phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> however , within quantum mechanics the phenomenon is more subtle : if the lyapunov exponent that defines the chaos of the energy sequences is larger than certain critical value , the system behaves as the usual anderson model . </S>"
