    "the onset of the star formation process is broadly characterized by a dense collapsing cloud envelope surrounding the nascent protostar .",
    "the dense cloud or protostellar envelope is opaque to radiation shortward of about @xmath810  and most of the radiation from these sources is reprocessed and emitted in the far  infrared ( fir ) .",
    "furthermore , bipolar outflows from the protostar and disk carve out envelope cavities that enable a fraction of the protostellar luminosity to escape in the form of scattered light emission , predominantly at wavelengths shortward of @xmath810  .    the earliest phase of protostellar evolution , the class  0 phase @xcite , is thought to be short compared to the class  i phase @xcite , with combined class 0 and class i lifetimes of @xmath80.5  myr @xcite ; these estimates assume a constant star formation rate and a typical age for class  ii objects ( pre  main sequence stars with disks ) of 2 myr . at the onset of collapse and immediately before the class  0 phase , protostars may go through a brief first hydrostatic core ( fhsc ) phase where the forming protostellar object becomes opaque to its own radiation for the first time @xcite .",
    "the fhsc are expected to be very low  luminosity and deeply embedded .",
    "a population of very low luminosity protostars ( vellos ) were also recently identified by _ spitzer _  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , defined to have model  estimated internal source luminosities of less than 0.1  @xmath9 .",
    "vellos , however , appear more evolved than fhscs with features consistent with class  0 and i protostars",
    ". furthermore , while several fhsc candidates have been identified recently ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has proven observationally difficult to distinguish such sources from the young class  0 protostellar phase .",
    "it is therefore currently difficult to identify the very earliest phases of the formation of a protostar .    before the launch of _ spitzer _ and the advent of extremely sensitive mid  infrared surveys , conventional wisdom held that a class  0 protostar should not be detectable at wavelengths shortward of 10  due to the envelope opacity @xcite .",
    "outflows , however , can carve out cavities in the protostellar envelopes at a very early age and are expected to widen with evolution @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent simulations have shown that even the extremely young fhsc sources may be capable of driving outflows @xcite . regardless of evolutionary state ,",
    "the outflow cavities enable near to mid  infrared light from the protostar and disk to escape and scatter off dust grains in the cavity or on the cavity walls .",
    "this phenomenon has been well  known for class  i sources @xcite , but class  0 protostars were only well  detected in the mid  infrared with _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite . the scattered light from class  0",
    "protostars is often brightest at wavelengths @xmath83.6  or 4.5  due to the dense envelope obscuration at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of results from recent space  based and ground  based surveys have resulted in well  sampled spectral energy distributions from the near  infrared to the ( sub)millimeter for large samples of protostellar objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these seds are dominated by scattered light between @xmath81  and 10  , optically thick thermal dust emission from @xmath810 to @xmath8160  , and optically thin dust emission at wavelengths longward of @xmath8160  .",
    "radiative transfer models of protostellar collapse have become increasingly important to interpret these data since these can account for the varying temperature and density profiles in the envelopes surrounding the protostar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large number of free model parameters  such as the combination of outflow cavities , rotationally flattened envelopes @xcite , and varying viewing angles  can however make the best  fit sed model parameters highly degenerate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , sources viewed at nearly edge  on orientations can be substantially more obscured than sources at the same evolutionary state viewed from a less extreme vantage point .",
    "thus , standard diagnostics such as bolometric temperature or mid  infrared spectral index can yield vastly different results depending on the source inclination ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "radiative transfer models can help break some of these degeneracies but ambiguities can remain as to whether a source has a very dense envelope or if it is simply viewed edge  on .",
    "while much has been learned about the class  0 phase from observations and modeling , there are relatively few class  0 objects present in nearby star  forming clouds and globules @xcite compared to the numbers of class  i and class  ii sources .",
    "one of the principal goals of recent star formation surveys has been to understand the evolution of protostellar sources .",
    "@xcite generated models for the smooth luminosity evolution of protostellar objects that will become 0.3   1  and 3  stars .",
    "these models , however , over predict the luminosities of most protostars located in nearby star  forming regions , a fact that is taken as evidence for episodic accretion @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that the observed luminosity functions of protostars can be explained through a dependence of the mass accretion rate on the instantaneous and final mass of the protostar .",
    "the low resolutions and sensitivities of previous fir instrumentation have made the detection of protostars in more distant and richer star  forming regions difficult and subject to substantial confusion .",
    "thus , studies of protostellar evolution have been limited to combining all known class  0 protostars from the nearby regions into a single analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to achieve a more robust sample size .    the advent of the _ herschel space observatory",
    "@xcite has tremendously improved resolution and sensitivity to fir radiation , where protostars emit the bulk of their energy .",
    "these improvements enable the study of protostellar populations to be extended to more distant , richer regions of star formation that have more statistically significant samples of protostars in the class  0 and i phases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "orion is the richest star  forming region within 500  pc of the sun @xcite , at a distance of @xmath8420 pc ( average value ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large sample of protostars in orion enables studies of protostellar evolution to be carried out for a single star forming complex where all protostars lie at nearly the same distance with a statistically significant sample , comparable to or larger than all the nearby regions combined .",
    "the large sample may also enable short timescale phenomena ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be detected such as brief periods of high envelope infall rate in the earliest phases of star formation .",
    "even with the increased numbers of protostars in orion , however , it is unclear if we would expect to detect fhscs given the faintness of these sources and short lifetimes of less than 10  kyr @xcite .",
    "the pacs imaging of the hops program has the potential to identify protostars that were not detected by _",
    "spitzer _  due to a combination of opacity of the envelope and/or confusion with nearby sources .",
    "indeed , the pacs 70  band of _ herschel _  is ideal for detecting such protostars , with the highest angular resolution , limiting the blending of sources .",
    "also , the lower opacity relative to mips 24  allows the reprocessed warm inner envelope radiation to escape .",
    "finally , and most importantly , a 70  point source is strong evidence for an embedded protostar because external heating can not raise temperatures high enough to emit at this wavelength .",
    "thus , some cores in sub  millimeter surveys that were previously identified as starless may in reality be protostellar .",
    "using _ herschel _ , we have serendipitously identified a sample of 70  point sources that were not identified in the previous _ spitzer _",
    "protostar sample @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have identified a subset of these that have the reddest 70  to 24  colors of all protostars in the combined orion sample .",
    "these sources may have the densest envelopes and are possibly the youngest detected orion protostars and we name them `` pacs bright red sources '' or pbrs",
    ".    we will describe the methodology of identifying these sources and classify them as either being protostellar , extragalactic contamination , or spurious detections coincident with extended emission .",

    "we discuss the observations , data processing , and photometry extraction .",
    "the pacs data were acquired simultaneously at 70  and 160  over 5@xmath10 or 8@xmath11 field sizes . the field sizes and centers",
    "were chosen to maximize observing efficiency by allowing each field to include as many of the target _",
    "spitzer_selected protostars @xcite as possible while minimizing redundant coverage .",
    "the observations were acquired at medium scan speed ( 20@xmath12sec@xmath13 ) , and are composed of two orthogonal scans with homogeneous coverage .",
    "the pacs data were reduced using the _ herschel _  interactive processing environment ( hipe ) version 8.0 build 248 and 9.0 build 215 .",
    "we used a custom built pipeline to process data from their raw form ( the so  called level 0 data ) to fully calibrated time lines ( level 1 ) just prior to the map  making step .",
    "our pipeline uses the same processing steps as described by @xcite but also include the following additions and modifications .",
    "first , we used a spatial redundancy based algorithm to identify and mask cosmic ray hits .",
    "second , we mitigated instrument cross ",
    "talk artifacts by masking ( flagging as unusable ) detector array columns affected by cross ",
    "talk noise .",
    "this technique is effective but at the expense of loss of signal from the affected detector array columns .",
    "third , we used the `` fm6 '' version of the instrument responsivity , which has a direct bearing on the absolute calibration of the final mosaics .",
    "the level 1 data were processed with `` scanamorphos '' @xcite version 14.0 .",
    "the final maps were produced using the _",

    "the final map pixel scales used in this work are 1.0@xmath12/pix at 70  and 2.0@xmath12/pix at 160  .",
    "the photometry was performed in the following fashion .",
    "we first derived customized aperture corrections to the 70  and 160  data using the _ herschel _  science center ( hsc ) provided observations of vesta ( to be discussed in more detail in fischer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "at 70  , we used radii of sizes @xmath14 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , for the aperture and sky annuli respectively . for these parameters we derived an aperture correction of @xmath16 , where the measured flux in the aperture is divided by this correction to obtain a total point  source flux . at 160  , we used aperture radii of @xmath17 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , for the aperture and sky annuli respectively .",
    "similarly , we derived an aperture correction of @xmath19 .",
    "the encircled energy fractions provided by the photaperturecorrectionpointsource task in hipe do not account for the effect of applying an inner sky annulus that is close to the size of the source aperture and small compare to the psf",
    ". our apertures therefore account for 34% of the source flux that is removed .",
    "furthermore , our adopted aperture sizes are smaller than the pacs instrument team recommendation but were chosen to minimize contribution from nebulosity ( extended , non point  like emission ) often surrounding the protostars in orion . given the complex structure in the images and at times crowded fields , our aperture photometry may suffer from blending and contamination .",
    "the photometric errors include a 10% systematic error floor added in quadrature to the standard photometric uncertainties .",
    "these errors represent systematic uncertainties in our photometry and aperture correction , as well as the overall calibration uncertainty of pacs .",
    "we note that the reported hsc point - source calibration uncertainties for pacs are @xmath20% at 70  and @xmath21% at 160  , and were derived from isolated photometric standards .",

    "these data were acquired using the medium scan speed ( 20@xmath12sec@xmath13 ) and cover an area much larger than the hops fields .",
    "these data were processed in a similar way to the hops processing described above . following the above 70  and 160  analysis ,",

    "we obtained sub  millimeter ( smm ) continuum maps using the laboca and saboca bolometer arrays on the apex telescope .",
    "laboca @xcite is a @xmath23250 bolometer array operating at 870  , with a spatial resolution of @xmath24 at fwhm .",

    "the observing and data reduction procedures were similar to those used for laboca .",
    "for both cameras , observations were carried out between 2009 november and 2012 june , and are still ongoing to complete our submillimeter orion survey .",
    "conditions were generally fair over the course of our observing campaign .",
    "the observations will be summarized in more detail by stanke et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation .",
    "the beam sizes of the final reduced maps are @xmath26 and @xmath27 fwhm for the saboca and laboca observations , respectively .",

    "when possible , if there was a strong source detection , we re - centered using the 70  catalog source coordinates .",
    "given the contributions of flux due to surrounding cold material , such as filaments and other extended envelope structure , it is likely that a single photometric measure can suffer from large systematic effects .",
    "we have measured source fluxes in three ways : + 1 .",
    "we measured the source peak flux per beam .",
    "we measured source flux over an aperture with radius equal to the fwhm at the corresponding wavelength ( r = @xmath26 and @xmath27 at 350 and 870  , respectively ) , using a sky annulus with inner and outer radii equal to @xmath28\\times$]fwhm , corresponding to @xmath29 and @xmath30 at 350  , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 at 870  .",

    "the mips data are saturated toward the orion nebula and parts in the ngc2024 region ; we exclude these saturated regions from our analysis .",
    "the identification of protostars with the _ spitzer _  data was based primarily on the presence of a flat or rising spectral energy distributions between 4.5  @xmath35 m and 24  @xmath35 m @xcite .",
    "in addition , megeath et al .  identified objects which have point source detections only at 24  @xmath35 m but which also showed other indicators of protostellar nature such as the presence of jets in the irac bands . to minimize contamination from galaxies ,",

    "the majority of the hops sample consists of _ spitzer_identified protostars with 24  detections ; hence , protostars in regions that are saturated in the 24  images of orion , namely the brightest regions of the orion nebula and ngc2024 , are not included .",
    "these protostars were also required to have a predicted 70  flux @xmath39  20  mjy as extrapolated from their 3  to 24  seds .",
    "in addition , protostar candidates with only 24  detections were included if there was independent information of their protostellar nature .",

    "the uncertainty in there absolute number of protostars is due to the ongoing process of eliminating contamination from the sample .",
    "to find protostars which were not reliably identified with _ spitzer _ , we must first isolate a sample of sources that are detected in the pacs 70  band but are either fainter than 7.0 magnitudes or undetected in mips 24  waveband . to identify such sources in each hops field",
    "we first generate a 70  source catalog using the photvis tool  @xcite .",

    "we find that for the hops data ",
    "set , weight map values of @xmath2320 are confined to the outer higher noise edges of our scan maps .",
    "we therefore use the weight maps to reject edge sources from the catalog at this phase of the analysis .",
    "we accomplish this by requiring that the mean value of the weight map in a @xmath40 pixel area centered on the candidate source have a value of at least 20 . for reference ,",
    "all hops 70  scan maps have weight map values greater than 60 over most of the map areas .",
    "the resulting preliminary source catalog includes all sources in the 70  images , i.e. , previously identified _ spitzer _  sources , new candidate protostars , nebulosity , and other undesirable features and artifacts in the images .",
    "we then cross  correlate this pacs 70  preliminary catalog with the existing _ spitzer _  catalog to eliminate all previously identified protostars in each field that are brighter than the previously adopted 24  cutoff of 7  mag @xcite .",
    "therefore our sample includes by definition only sources that are faint or undetected in the previous _ spitzer _  catalog .    to identify previous source detections",
    ", we require that a source be matched to within a positional offset of 8@xmath12 when cross  correlated with the _ spitzer _  catalog .",
    "this threshold is conservatively large compared to the _ spitzer _  astrometry and is meant to encompass two main sources of astrometric error .",
    "first , it is possible that the absolute coordinates of a source may shift as function of wavelength ( although this effect is expected to be relatively small ) since different wavelengths may trace different material near the protostars .",
    "second , the _ herschel _  pointing accuracy , which is of order @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , dominates the positional accuracy for most sources when comparing the _ spitzer _  catalog source coordinates to the _ herschel _  70  coordinates . to match coordinates robustly , we therefore adopt a conservatively large 8@xmath12 threshold . we find that inspection of the matched sources by eye shows that this threshold works well and provides a low rate of mismatched or duplicate sources .",
    "our final goal is to obtain a sample of previously unidentified and uncharacterized _ herschel _  protostar candidates .",
    "these sources should be characterized by a point  like appearance at 70  .",
    "therefore , after rejecting all _ spitzer _  protostars as described above , we next apply a simple fwhm ( or apparent size ) filter to the remaining 70  sources .",
    "the distribution of 70  azimuthally averaged fwhm values is shown in figure  [ fig : fwhm ] as the solid black histogram .",
    "we find a clear peak in the distribution at low fwhm values , indicating a population of point  like sources .",
    "based on this distribution , we adopt a fwhm threshold of 7.8@xmath12 , meant to select 70  point  sources .",
    "we find 127 sources that fulfill the criteria listed here : 85 of these have 24  detections while 42 do not .    in a further step",
    ", we then require that all 70  sources also have a 160  detection and not upper limits .",

    "the completeness of the 24  data depends strongly on the presence of nebulosity and point source crowding . to account for these factors ,",
    "we measure the fluctuations of the 24  signal in an annulus centered on the position of the _ herschel _  point  source using the the root median square deviation , or rmedsq ( see equation 1 of * ? ? ?",

    "up to this point , we have discussed two distinct and well  defined samples of sources in orion : i ) the sample of candidate protostars identified with _ herschel _  that have pacs 70  and 160  detections but mips 24  magnitudes greater than 7.0  mag , ii ) the sample of protostars that were reliably identified with _ spitzer _  ( 24  magnitudes @xmath67  mag * ? ? ?",

    "the coordinates , _ spitzer_photometry , and _ herschel _  photometry of the sample are listed in table  [ tab : phot ] , while the apex 350  and 870  photometry are presented in table  [ tab : photapex ] . since the apex photometry are non  trivial to extract due in large part to contamination by cold surrounding material and , at 870  specifically , by the large beam size , we present three measures of the source flux , as described above .      as discussed above , we select 18 pbrs in orion with observed @xmath64 colors greater than @xmath70 .",
    "we show 4.5  to 870  images of 5 example pbrs in figures  [ fig : img7 ] to  [ fig : img8 ] ( see appendix for the full sample images ) .",
    "furthermore , in figure  [ fig : allseds ] we show the full set of 18 pbrs observed seds from 24  to 870  .",
    "inspection of the observed seds confirms that the pbrs sample is composed of cold , envelope dominated sources with peak emission always located at @xmath71  .",
    "in addition , the peak of the seds , and thus the temperatures , are well  constrained for all pbrs because we have obtained apex sub ",
    "millimeter coverage for all sources .    in table",
    "[ tab : obs ] , we present some basic properties of the pbrs . in particular , we find that 12/18 sources exhibit _ spitzer _  4.5  emission indicative of outflow activity .",
    "we also include some references to previous detections ( see appendix ) .",
    "furthermore , 4/18 sources have significant levels of 4.5  emission that are indeed consistent with a high inclination .",
    "the majority of sources , however , do not give clear indications of their inclinations at any observed wavelength , and therefore we can not make any statements about their possible orientations based on their appearance in the images . we find indications from the 4.5  image morphology that two sources ( hops341 and hops354 ) are binaries , while seven sources have a nearby source within @xmath72 .",
    "two reside in more crowded regions , and seven sources appear truly isolated .",
    "we find that a significant fraction ( 13/18 ) of sources appear to reside in filamentary regions , i.e. , the extended 870  emission appears significantly elongated .",
    "the four sources with significant indications of a high inclination orientation are hops169 , 302002 , hops341 , and hops354 ( see appendix for figures  [ fig : img3 ] , [ fig : img9 ] , [ fig : img11 ] , and [ fig : img13 ] ) .",
    "inspection of their 4.5  images reveals that their outflows appear well collimated and relatively narrow .",
    "indeed , we might expect that sources that that have denser envelopes , and are therefore presumably younger , may have more narrow cavity opening angles ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . as an additional check on our density analysis ( see above ) , we use this inclination information for an independent check of the envelope densities of these four sources . despite the relatively sparsely sampled seds , we fix the inclination to @xmath73 and fit the source",
    "we find that even when we fix the model inclination to @xmath74 , we still obtain envelope densities significantly above the @xmath75 value found in the previous section .",
    "we calculate l@xmath3 , t@xmath3 @xcite , and l@xmath76/l@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the errors in l@xmath77 and t@xmath3 are derived with the same monte carlo method as described in   6.2 for the modified black ",
    "body parameters .",
    "we exclude the irac upper limits from this analysis ; including these limits has an effect on our l@xmath3 and t@xmath3 estimates that is smaller than our estimated errors .",
    "we do , however , include the 24  upper limits ; therefore the l@xmath3  and t@xmath3  values should be considered upper limits for sources not detected at this wavelength .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the effect of applying an average foreground reddening correction to all the new _ herschel _  candidate protostars .",
    "we find that dereddening the observed fluxes with extinction levels of @xmath78 magnitudes has no effect on the derived parameters because the observed seds are extremely red and cold .",
    "we show the locations of the herschel protostar candidates compared to the locations of the hops sample in figure  [ fig : orionimg ] ; these positions are overlaid on the extinction map of orion .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the spatial distribution of the new candidate protostars and pbrs is non  uniform . to investigate this distribution",
    "further , we show the relative fraction of new sources as a function of individual region in table  [ tab : frac ] .",
    "the over  all number of new candidate protostars and pbrs is dominated by the orion a cloud , and in particular l1641 .",
    "this is not surprising since the l1641 region is quite large and contains more protostars compared to other orion regions .",
    "the fractions of new candidate protostars and pbrs compared to the total number of hops and new candidate protostars is , however , 2 times larger in orion b. this result is even more pronounced when we consider only the fractions of pbrs , with fractions that are more than 10 times larger in orion b. the ngc2068 ( also containing the ngc2071 nebula ) and ngc2024 ( also containing the horsehead or ngc2023 nebula ) fields in orion b have not only the largest fraction of new candidate protostars , but also of pbrs .",
    "while these numbers and fractions are subject to counting statistics and other possibly large sources of errors , the differences between orion a and orion b appear to be significant .",
    "about 5% of the combined protostars and candidate protostars in orion are pbrs . if we consider the pbrs as representing a distinct phase in the evolution of a protostar , and we assume a constant rate of star formation , the fraction the variation suggests that the protostars spend 5% of their lifetime in the pbrs phase ( approximately 25,000 years with the 0.5 myr protostellar lifetime of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , averaging over all orion regions .",
    "however , the assumed the duration of the pbrs phase would vary greatly with location , from @xmath79  years in the orion a cloud to @xmath80  years in the orion b cloud .",
    "there are two alternative explanations .",
    "first , there might be environmental reasons which would favor the formations of pbrs , or perhaps extend the duration of the pbrs phase , in the orion b cloud .",
    "second , the ages of all the protostars in the orion b cloud may be systematically younger than those in the orion a cloud . in this case",
    ", the regions containing the pbrs in the orion b could be undergoing very recent bursts of star formation .",
    "studies of pre  main sequence stars in the orion molecular clouds show little evidence for significant age differences between the orion a and b clouds .",
    "@xcite determined an age of @xmath82  myr for ngc2068 and ngc2071 , while @xcite , @xcite and @xcite determine ages for the onc and l1641 of @xmath82    3  myr .",
    "however , most of the protostars associated the ngc2068 and ngc2071 regions are outside the clusters of pre  main sequence stars and in dense filaments gas neighboring these clusters @xcite .",
    "a number of pbrs are in the lbs  23 clump ( directly south of ngc2068 ) and in the ngc2023 clump ( in the ngc2024 field ) ; these are two of the 5 most massive , dense clumps found in orion @xcite . compared to the other massive clumps ,",
    "both of these regions have @xmath81 the numbers of young stars per unit gas mass and hence may be quite young @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the gas in the lbs  23 and ngc2023 clumps may have dense gas filling factors that are much higher than the other massive clumps @xcite ; hence , they sources in these regions may be forming in a very different birth environment .",
    "the regions bordering the southern rim of the ngc2068 nebula and the northern rim of the ngc2071 nebula are also rich in protostars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the pbrs are found concentrated in sub",
    " regions which may indeed be quite young .",
    "we will investigate these possibilities in future work .",
    "in this section we describe our analysis of the physical properties of the pbrs as inferred from their colors and seds .",
    "we first compare the @xmath64 colors of the pbrs sample with those derived from a grid of models which adopt the solution for a rotating envelope undergoing collapse @xcite with outflow cavities along the rotation axis of the envelope @xcite .",
    "this analysis puts a constraint on the minimum inner density of the protostellar envelope .",
    "next , we compare the observed seds to model seds generated using the hyperion @xcite radiative transfer code .",
    "this set of models assumes radial power ",
    "law gradients consistent with either a collapsing core with a constant infall rate and a static isothermal core .",
    "the models also encompass various combinations of internal and external heating . given the prohibitively large computational time needed to explore the full range of parameters space using radiative transfer models , and given our inability to distinguish between models purely from five to six photometry points , we do not provide individual model fits to each protostars .",
    "instead we fit a single temperature modified black ",
    "body function to the observed seds at 70  and longer wavelengths .",
    "the modified black ",
    "body fits provide luminosities and an initial characterization of the envelope masses of the pbrs sample .",
    "we begin our analysis by using a simplified version of the @xcite protostellar envelope model grid to predict observed fluxes and colors for comparison with our pbrs .",
    "the density distribution of these models is that of the collapse of a spherical cloud in uniform rotation @xcite , which is the inner region of the @xcite model of the collapse of the slowly  rotating isothermal sphere .",
    "this model is then modified by the inclusion of outflow cavities of various shapes @xcite .",
    "this schematic model envelope captures the dependence of the short wavelength ( 24  and 70  ) fluxes on inclination due to rotation and bipolar cavities .",
    "the model fluxes depend upon the mass infall rate , the angular momentum of the mass currently falling in , the outflow cavity properties , the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight , and the luminosity of the central source , as well as the assumed dust properties .",
    "the thermal emission of the dusty envelope does not depend directly on the mass infall rate but instead on the density of the envelope .",
    "the model assumes free  fall at a constant rate , which results in a density profile with shape @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the overall scaling of the density is characterized by @xmath75 , the density at 1  au in the limit of no rotation : @xmath83 the envelope mass infall @xmath84 rate is related to @xmath75 via the free  fall velocity , which in turn depends upon the unknown central mass @xmath85 .",
    "the actual model density structure departs from @xmath86 on small scales because of the angular momentum of the infalling material .",
    "this enters into the model through the parameter @xmath87 , the outer disk radius at which infalling material currently lands ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the rotation leads to a significant dependence of the sed on the inclination of the rotation axis relative to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this dependence is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of outflow cavities @xcite which are assumed to be aligned along the rotation axis .",
    "finally , the overall shape of the sed is only weakly affected by the luminosity of the central source ( @xmath88 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so this is easily scaled .    to roughly compare observed pbrs colors with those predicted by our model grid in figure  [ fig : modcolors ] we show the effects of varying the model inclination , envelope density , and cavity opening angle on the @xmath64 color and 70  flux .",
    "as stated above , these model tracks are based on a simplified version of the @xcite model grid ; we refer the reader to that publication for details . in brief",
    ", the model tracks that we consider here have the same fixed parameters as those listed in table  1 of @xcite , including a fixed central mass of @xmath89  ; in addition we have fixed the cavity shape exponent to a value of @xmath90 , and the envelope outer radius to @xmath91  au .",
    "we have , however , expanded the envelope infall rate grid relative to the @xcite grid to larger values ( up to @xmath92  yr@xmath13 on a pseudo  logarithmic grid ) and included a model with no envelope .",
    "as described above , for our model grid we assume that the envelope density falls off as @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , while our model grid is parametrized in terms of @xmath84 , with a fixed central mass of @xmath94  , we will refer to @xmath75 throughout this section .",
    "we note that the assumed central masses of protostellar sources remain largely unconstrained observationally ( however see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but may be lower than our assumed value .",
    "the effect of a lower central mass would be to lower @xmath84 for a given value of @xmath75 .",
    "for example , if the central mass is @xmath95  , the infall rates reported for our models would be reduced by a factor of 0.6 .",
    "the assumed central mass , however , does not change the value of @xmath75 corresponding to a given model sed .",
    "furthermore , our small assumed disk radius does not strongly affect the trends shown here .    with this model grid",
    "we isolate the effects , albeit in a simplified fashion , of varying the model inclination ( viewing angle to the protostar ) , envelope density ( @xmath75 ) , and cavity opening angle ( @xmath96 ) on the 70  fluxes and @xmath64 colors . in figure",
    "[ fig : modcolors ] , we show model tracks through 70  flux vs.  @xmath64 color space for high inclination ( @xmath73 ) viewing angles as a function of both @xmath96 and envelope density ( @xmath75 ) . by analyzing only the high inclination models we obtain a lower limit on the envelope density required to reproduce the red @xmath64 colors .",
    "we assume a fixed disk accretion rate of @xmath97  @xmath98  yr@xmath13 , a disk outer radius of @xmath99  au , and a central source luminosity of @xmath100  l@xmath7 .",
    "increasing @xmath97  and @xmath101 drives the models to both bluer @xmath64 colors and brighter 70  fluxes , while decreasing the inclination drives the models to bluer @xmath64 colors .",
    "therefore , we find that no model in our grid can explain @xmath64 colors with envelope densities less than log @xmath102 ( or equivalently an envelope infall rate of @xmath84  @xmath103  yr@xmath13 ) . while models with larger values of @xmath75 and other combinations of parameters can be found for bluer @xmath64 colors , this analysis sets an approximate lower limit on the expected envelope densities of sources with @xmath69 of log @xmath104 .",
    "that is , high source inclinations alone can not explain the red @xmath64 colors of the pbrs , which also require dense envelopes .",
    "we expect that this value of @xmath75 should lie well within the class  0 range ; e.g. , @xcite found for a sample of 22 class  i sources in taurus log @xmath105 , while over half had @xmath75 values that are lower than log @xmath106 . note that the @xcite data  set included far better sampling of the source seds and , most critically ,",
    "spitzer _",
    "irs spectroscopy , allowing for a more robust estimate of the parameters of sources in their sample .",
    "in contrast , our seds generally are envelope dominated with few sources having robust detections shortward of 24  . therefore",
    ", any estimate of the value of the envelope density will be necessarily imprecise and have a back of the envelope character .",
    "that said , our comparison with the model grid and previous derived values of the envelope density leads us to conclude that the @xmath69 color cut , while not uniformly selecting a unique envelope density threshold , will preferentially select class 0 sources with log @xmath107 , irrespective of source inclination .",
    "having demonstrated that the very red @xmath64 colors require large values of @xmath75 , as expected for seds peaking at long wavelengths , we proceed by analyzing the pbrs in the context of more simplified models . in",
    "what follows , we carry out two independent analyses of the source seds : a qualitative model image comparison using 1d models generated with the hyperion  @xcite radiative transfer code , and modified black  body fitting to the observed seds at 70  and longer wavelengths .",
    "we attempt to maintain consistency by using similar envelope dust models throughout the analysis presented here . for the hyperion model image analysis we use the @xcite opacities .",
    "these opacities are similar to the commonly assumed @xcite ( `` oh5 '' ; see below ) opacities but include both the scattering and absorption components at short wavelengths , needed for radiative transfer calculations .",
    "specifically , we use the `` icsgra2 '' @xcite model opacities , which include icy silicates and bare graphites , with a coagulation time of 0.1  myr .",
    "we assume the dust model from @xcite for the long  wavelength modified black ",
    "body fits , specifically , their `` oh5 '' opacities , corresponding to column 5 of their table  1 . these opacities reflect grains having thin ice mantles with @xmath108 years of coagulation time at an assumed gas density of @xmath109  @xmath110 .",
    "we use the hyperion @xcite monte carlo radiative transfer code to investigate some basic properties of the pbrs .",
    "we run a series of spherically symmetric models under a range of very simple assumptions , and produce simulated images . as stated above , the dust model we assume is that of @xcite ( \" icsgra2  ) . to explore which model assumptions might be reasonable for analyzing the properties of the reddest sources in orion",
    ", we investigate a few limiting model scenarios .",
    "we therefore disregard the details of the individual source seds of the entire red sample and qualitatively compare the seds of the two sources with the smallest and largest values of l@xmath3 and t@xmath3 ( sources 091016 and hops358 , respectively ; see table  [ tab : mbb ] ) with photometry derived from model images .",

    "the central source is taken to have 10  l@xmath7  and a spectrum given by a planck function at the effective temperature of the sun ( 5778k ) .",
    "the choice of the stellar temperature is arbitrary , and is unimportant for the modeling presented here , since all sources are deeply embedded and all stellar radiation is reprocessed  only the total bolometric luminosity is important ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the r@xmath121 and t@xmath121 degeneracy ) .",
    "the high levels of spatial filtering caused by our adopted aperture photometry scheme require us to assume such a central source luminosity to roughly match the flux levels in the observed seds .",
    "furthermore , while a 1pc sized envelope is larger than usually assumed , the high levels of spatial filtering inherent in the aperture photometry cause us to be insensitive to structure on scales larger than the assumed aperture sizes .",
    "the model images have a resolution of 1@xmath122 , or 420  au at our assumed distance .",
    "we convolve these images with the azimuthally averaged psfs provided by @xcite , except in the case of the saboca 350  and laboca 870  images .",
    "these wavelengths are convolved with gaussian psfs with fwhms equal to 7.4@xmath12 and 19@xmath12 respectively , i.e. , the nominal beam sizes for our observations .",
    "all model image photometry is then performed on the convolved model images using the same aperture and sky annulus parameters as those applied to the data .",
    "the use of such photometric aperture parameters can cause large amounts of spatial filtering due the small sizes of the apertures relative to the beam sizes and the extent of the core emission ( see below ) .",
    "we show our extracted model seds in figure  [ fig : hypsr ] and a subset of the corresponding model images in figure  [ fig : modimg ] . in general , we find that models without internal sources are very unlikely to match the observed pbrs properties , on the basis that their seds are less luminous and peak at longer wavelengths than the observed seds for all density profile shapes that we assume ; see figure  [ fig : hypsr ] , top panels . while the `` core+external  models ( top right panel ) suffer from severe spatial filtering , it is unlikely that such models will well represent the data as these seds tend to also peak at longer wavelengths .",
    "for the two classes of models with internal sources we find better agreement with the data ; see lower panels of figure  [ fig : hypsr ] . while steeper envelope profiles may imply somewhat higher envelope densities , the range in plausible densities for @xmath123 is @xmath124 to @xmath125 , while for @xmath126 values of @xmath127 roughly agree with the shapes the observed seds .",
    "we note that we find very little difference between the `` star+external''and the ' ' star  model in the @xmath128  regime , possibly indicating that our assumed isrf strength relative to the assumed internal source luminosity may be underestimated compared to what we might expect to find regions like orion .",
    "an individual detailed fit to each protostar is beyond the scope of this work considering the vast amount of parameter space needed to model protostellar seds ( i.e. , source luminosity , envelope density , envelope rotation , outflow cavity geometry , external heating , outer envelope structure ) .",
    "furthermore , unlike most of the hops protostars , whose properties can be constrained from a combination of far  ir photometry , 5  to 40  _ spitzer_/irs spectra , and hubble near  ir imaging @xcite , the properties of the seds must currently be derived from 5 to 6 photometry points at long wavelength . while the above modeling and analysis shows that the internal source is important , the longer wavelength fluxes are probing the bulk of the envelope mass , expected to mostly be at a single temperature .",

    "finally , we estimate l@xmath5 from the model sed , where l@xmath5 is integrated over @xmath144 .",
    "if a given source sed has coverage over fewer than 4 long  wavelength points , we do not fit a model to the sed .",
    "while all the pbrs sources satisfy this criterion , all the new candidate protostars and hops sources do not ( see   5.2 ) and are therefore not fitted .",
    "the errors on @xmath135 , m@xmath143 , and the thermal component of the luminosity ( l@xmath145 ) are estimated through a straight  forward monte carlo method . for each source",
    "we generate 2000 synthetic seds drawn from a normal density with mean and standard deviation equal to those of the measured sed at each wavelength .",
    "we then fit each synthetic sed .",
    "the reported error is equal to the standard deviation of the resulting distribution of each parameter .",
    "these errors do not include systematics introduced by , e.g. , our dust model assumption or variation in the gas  to  dust ratio .",
    "we show the modified black ",

    "the resulting best  fit mass , luminosity , and temperature is also indicated for each source .",
    "the model fits the data surprising well considering that significant temperature gradients in the envelope are expected .",
    "furthermore , in all cases the 24  point , when detected , has a much higher flux level than the modified black  body model .",
    "we interpret this discrepancy as strong evidence for internal heating by a protostar .    excluding the 70  point and fitting only the @xmath146  sed has a minor effect on the resulting parameter values . without 70  ,",
    "the masses systematically increase by 40% , the temperatures decrease by 5% , and the luminosities decrease by 7% .",
    "this small effect may be understood by the fact that the 100  fluxes are well  correlated with the 70  fluxes for this sample , tracing similar material near the protostars .",
    "the temperatures at 100  and 70  are not dramatically different , and most likely both points are dominated by optical ",
    "depth effects such that the @xmath147 surface is not significantly different between the two wavelengths . from @xcite ,",
    "the radius of the @xmath147 surface can be roughly approximated as @xmath148 ; this relation implies that @xmath149 .",
    "our best  fit modified black  body model always underestimates the observed 870  flux of all sources . the model sub ",
    "millimeter seds are always bluer than the observed seds .",
    "we find that the discrepancy is at the @xmath150  jy level ( or a factor of @xmath151 excess ) , where the error bar represents the standard deviation in the residual distribution .",
    "it is likely that this discrepancy is dominated by the larger beam size of the 870  observations which has the effect of mixing the source flux with that of the surrounding cold and possibly high  column environment .",
    "contamination to the 870  flux by disk emission may also increase this discrepancy .",
    "@xcite find average disk masses of @xmath152  ( with a large scatter ) across their sample of class  0 sources .",
    "the sources in their sample that are comparable to our pbrs , however , are those with the lowest values of t@xmath153 . for reference , they found that iras4a1 , with a t@xmath154  k , has the largest disk mass of 0.46  in their sample ; on the other hand , l1157 , with a similar t@xmath155  k , has a disk mass about a factor of 4 smaller .",
    "we estimate that a 30  k disk of 0.5  would contribute @xmath156  jy to the beam flux at 870  ( assuming @xcite dust opacities , as above ) .",
    "therefore , disk emission could indeed contribute to the observed 870  flux but further detailed observations at high resolution are needed to disentangle the envelope component from the possible disk emission .",
    "another possible source of ambiguity in interpreting the 870  flux discrepancy is the model dust opacity assumption .",
    "furthermore , we do not find an 870  discrepancy in the analysis of model images presented in the previous section .",
    "this indicates that large disk masses may not be necessary to explain the sub",
    " millimeter fluxes .",
    "we therefore emphasize that the disk masses inferred here from the 870  excess should be regarded only as upper limits ; further detailed investigation into the disk properties of our sources is deferred to future work .",
    "independent of these issues , it is clear that a more accurate treatment of the data would require all images to be convolved to a matched resolution ; however , this approach would have the effect of causing non ",
    "detections for a majority of sources at the shorter wavelengths due to the relatively large limiting beam size of our data  set ( @xmath157 at 870  ) .",
    "homogeneously extracted seds are therefore not feasible for this data  set as a whole .",
    "nevertheless , we test the effects of convolving the the data before extracting the seds .",
    "we choose pbrs 119019 as a test source because it is isolated and has approximately median values for the best ",
    "fit modified black  body temperature , luminosity , and mass . ignoring the 870  data ,",
    "this source is clearly detected at 70  , 100  , 160  , and 350  .",
    "for these four wavelengths , the largest beam size of @xmath158 corresponds to the 160  data .",
    "we therefore convolve the 70  , 100  , and 350  data to a resolution matching the 160  observations and extract a beam  smoothed sed .",
    "we then fit this sed in the same way as described above .",
    "compared to the non  convolved sed modified black  body fitting results , we find that the temperature decreases by @xmath159% , the luminosity increases by @xmath160% , and the the mass in the thermal component increases by @xmath161% .",
    "these systematic shifts are similar to but somewhat larger than the errors quoted in table  [ tab : mbb ] ( @xmath162% on the temperature , @xmath160% on the luminosity , and @xmath161% on the mass ) .",
    "we note , however , that the errors quoted in table  [ tab : mbb ] are purely random and do not include any systematic component .",
    "we therefore conclude that extracting seds from images matched to a resolution of @xmath158 will not greatly affect our results .    modified black ",
    "body fits provide a somewhat limited means of analysis of our sources since the model assumes a single temperature and density along the line of sight for the emitting material .",
    "we expect that the assumption of a single line  of  sight temperature will cause an underestimate of the source masses ( e , g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , radiative transfer models have large ambiguities in the assumed source temperature and density structure , leading to mass estimates that strongly model  dependent . furthermore , the dust law that is assumed will introduce significant uncertainties into the derived masses , irrespective of the analysis method that is implemented .",
    "for example , the masses listed in table  [ tab : mbb ] increase by a factor of @xmath234 on average when we assume @xcite @xmath163 ism  like dust .",
    "these issues indicate that the masses derived here represent lower limits to the true envelope masses . nevertheless , we consider the modified black  body fits to the measured photometry to provide the most robust estimates of the mass that we currently have .",
    "we note that with only 5 sed flux points at best , fitting a multiple component ( modified ) black  body model can not be justified .",
    "since most of the mass is located at relatively large scales and expected to have cold temperatures , excluding the warmer shorter wavelength data arising from inner material will not significantly increase the masses we derive .",
    "the modified black ",
    "body fits thus to provide an approximate measurement of the optical  depth averaged gross properties of the envelopes being investigated .",
    "these issues point to the need for a more sophisticated modeling approach that will be carried out in future work .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : modcolors ] , the observed @xmath64 colors of a protostar can be driven towards redder values through various strongly degenerate parameters .",
    "for example , the total column of material along the line  of  sight ( los ) towards a given protostar can have multiple contributions : the attenuation of the mid  ir emission by dense foreground material , the density of the envelope , the amount of envelope flattening , the opening angle of the outflow cavity , and the source inclination .",
    "furthermore , the assumed model central protostar mass remains largely unconstrained by observations to date and can affect the interpretation of the @xmath64 colors .    foreground extinction can have various contributions , such as intervening dust between the observer and the cloud and dense material associated with the cloud itself , such as filamentary material . of these two components ,",
    "the first is expected to be relatively small , while the latter can be expected to vary from source to source by relatively large amounts , with a corresponding effect on the observed colors . for example , some pbrs are located in filamentary regions ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : img7 ] and [ fig : img8 ] ) , while others appear more isolated ( e.g. , see appendix for figure  [ fig : img6 ] ) . we have estimated the effects of foreground extinction levels up to a level of @xmath164 mag , and find that the values of l@xmath3 , l@xmath5 , and t@xmath3  not significantly affected",
    ".    on the other hand , the effects of source inclination are not as straightforward to assess .",
    "when considering the presence of flattened rotating envelopes , disks , and outflow cavities , the source inclination will have a large effect on the observed source sed , as illustrated by the model tracks shown in figure  [ fig : modcolors ] ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it appears that the very red pbrs can be explained by multiple effects that all result in increasingly red observed @xmath64 colors .",
    "these very red colors may be driven by elevated envelope densities ( or equivalently , @xmath84 ) , high source inclinations , or elevated levels of extinction associated with structures larger than the envelope  protostar system .",
    "the current data and sed coverage do not allow us to break these degeneracies conclusively .",
    "furthermore , we consider it likely that the red observed colors are not driven any single cause , but instead are the result of several .",
    "we have , however , designed our pbrs selection to find the densest envelopes in orion ( c.f . , figure  [ fig : modcolors ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the effect of external foreground extinction is not expected to be large at these long wavelengths , even with elevated levels of material along the los ( see above ) .",
    "indeed , we have also shown that the pbrs require a central heating source , indicating that the detection of a 70  point source drives the interpretation of the sample as class  0 sources , irrespective of source inclination",
    ". however , we note that if the central masses are significantly different than the assumed value of 0.5  , then for a fixed reference envelope density the inferred envelope infall rates need to be scaled accordingly ( see equation  1 ) .    to further investigate the evolutionary state of the pbrs , in figure  [ fig : blt ] we show we the values of l@xmath3 , t@xmath3 , and l@xmath5@xmath165l@xmath3for the entire sample of new candidate protostars and the previously identified _",
    "spitzer _  hops sample ( fischer et al .  in preparation ) . in the left panel , we show l@xmath3  vs.  t@xmath3  for the entire sample of new protostar candidates , including those flagged as possible extra  galactic contamination .",
    "we also show the four reference class  0 sources presented in table  [ tab : mbb ] . the pbrs sample in particular , and the entire sample of new candidate protostars ,",
    "are generally clustered around low t@xmath3  values .",
    "ignoring inclination degeneracies and other considerations , these low t@xmath3values indicate that the pbrs sample is indeed composed of young class  0 sources . in the right panel , we show t@xmath3  vs.  l@xmath76/l@xmath3 for the sources with sufficient coverage to estimate l@xmath5 ( see   6.2 ) .",
    "the pbrs , as expected if the sample can be explained as class  0 sources , cluster around larger values of l@xmath5/l@xmath3 compared to the rest of the sample .",
    "@xcite proposed the l@xmath5/l@xmath166 threshold for class  0 sources , and all but one of the new candidate protostars for which we can estimate l@xmath5 fall into this category .",
    "irrespective of the evolutionary indicator that is chosen ( t@xmath3  or l@xmath5/l@xmath3 ) , all of the new candidate protostars in both the reliable and lower probability categories ( green and yellow points , respectively ) , would be considered of class  0 status .",
    "finally , while the pbrs @xmath69 color criterion causes some sources with very low values of t@xmath3  and very high values of l@xmath5/l@xmath3 to be missed , the color selection is able to capture the vast majority of the most extreme class  0 sources at the extrema of the l@xmath5/l@xmath77 and t@xmath3  distributions .",
    "this evidence strongly supports the interpretation of the pbrs ( and indeed all the sources classified as reliable protostellar candidates ) as very dense class  0 protostars , irrespective of the source inclination . on the other hand , the new candidate protostar sample , taken as a whole ,",
    "may be explained by a combination of the effects described above : high inclination , high densities , and extreme values of foreground extinction , along with elevated levels of extragalactic contamination .",
    "of particular interest is the possibility that some of the sources classified as low probability protostars at low l@xmath3  values may be confirmed as bona fide protostars with future observations ( see * ? ? ?",

    "while the @xmath69 color selects sources with dense envelopes , this color criterion does not find all dense sources above the threshold of of @xmath171 .",
    "therefore this selection should be used in conjunction with other evolutionary indicators , namely millimeter and sub  millimeter measurements , to determine the nature of the observed sources .",
    "@xmath169 our modeling of the pbrs seds reveals that these sources are not consistent with being externally heated starless cores ; the presence of a 70  point source requires that the sample be interpreted as dense envelopes containing embedded protostars .",

    "these numbers suggest that if the pbrs represent a distinct phase in protostellar evolutions , protostars spend on average 5% of their lifetime in the pbrs phase .",
    "most of the pbrs in the orion b cloud are concentrated in dense gas near the ngc2068 , ngc2071 , and ngc2023 nebulae .",
    "these regions of dense gas are also known for a lack of more evolved pre  main sequence stars .",
    "the high percentage of pbrs in orion b suggests either that the regions containing the pbrs may currently be undergoing more vigorous star ",
