    "we propose a computational method to solve for the spectra and eigenstates of quasicrystalline electromagnetic structures by directly solving a periodic eigenproblem in a higher - dimensional lattice .",
    "such photonic quasicrystals ( pqcs ) have a number of unique properties compared to ordinary periodic structures  @xcite , especially in two or three dimensions where they can have greater rotational symmetry and therefore offer some hope of complete photonic band gaps with lower index contrast  @xcite than the roughly @xmath0:@xmath1 contrast currently required for periodic structures  @xcite .",
    "however , the study of two- and three - dimensional photonic quasicrystals has been hampered by the computational difficulty of modeling aperiodic structures , which has previously required large `` supercell '' calculations that capture only a portion of the infinite aperiodic lattice .",
    "our method , in contrast , captures the entire infinite aperiodic structure in a single higher - dimensional unit cell , and we believe that this approach will ultimately be much more computationally tractable for two- and three - dimensional quasicrystals .",
    "the idea that many quasicrystals can be constructed by an irrational slice of a higher - dimensional lattice is well known  @xcite , and in fact is the most common formulation of quasicrystals in two and three dimensions  @xcite , but the possibility of direct numerical calculations within the higher - dimensional space seems to have been little explored outside of some tight - binding calculations in quantum systems  @xcite . as a proof of concept ,",
    "we demonstrate a first implementation of the technique applied to one - dimensional quasicrystals , such as the well known fibonacci structure . not only can we reproduce the spectrum from transfer - matrix calculations , but we also show that the higher - dimensional picture provides an interesting way to visualize the eigenmodes and compute defect states in the infinite aperiodic structure .",
    "there have been several previous numerical approaches to simulating quasicrystal structures in electromagnetism and quantum mechanics . in one dimension ,",
    "a typical quasicrystal is an aperiodic sequence of two or more materials , determined either by a slice of a higher - dimensional lattice  @xcite or by some `` string concatenation '' rule  @xcite . in either case ,",
    "efficient @xmath2 transfer - matrix methods are available that allow one to quickly compute the transmission spectra and density of states for supercells consisting of many thousands of layers  @xcite .",
    "two- and three - dimensional quasicrystals are almost always defined as an irrational slice ( i.e. , incommensurate miller indices ) of a higher - dimensional lattice ; for example , the famous penrose tiling can be viewed as a two - dimensional slice of a five - dimensional cubic lattice or of a four - dimensional root lattice @xmath3  @xcite . in such cases , supercell computations of a finite portion of the infinite aperiodic structure ( or a rational approximant thereof  @xcite )",
    "require slower numerical methods , most commonly finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations  @xcite or planewave expansions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these methods become very expensive for large supercells , nearly prohibitively so for three - dimensional quasicrystals  there have been experiments for 3d pqcs  @xcite , but as yet few theoretical predictions  @xcite . with fdtd methods , for example , the pqc local density of states is typically integrated in monte - carlo fashion via random sources or initial conditions  @xcite , but many simulations are required to sample all possible modes in a large supercell .",
    "also , the finite domain of a supercell becomes even more significant in higher dimensions where a tractable supercell is necessarily smaller , as there can be localized states  @xcite whose presence is dependent on the particular region of the pqc considered .",
    "our method of computing the spectrum directly in the higher - dimensional unit cell , on the other hand , requires no supercell to capture the infinite aperiodic structure  it uniformly samples ( up to a finite resolution ) every possible supercell of the infinite quasicrystal , rather than any particular subsection .",
    "the influence of finite - resolution on the convergence of the spectrum can be systematically understood : one is not `` missing '' any part of the quasicrystal , so much as resolving the entire quasicrystal with lower resolution .",

    ", we present a sequence of one - dimensional examples in sec .  [ sec : results ] .",
    "first , we compare results for a one - dimensional `` fibonacci sequence '' with standard one - dimensional transfer - matrix techniques .",
    "second , as mentioned above , cut - and - project allows for a straightforward way of studying defects in the the quasicrystal with the same computational effort as the perfect pqc , and this is demonstrated in the one - dimensional `` fibonacci '' example .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the ease with which one can construct and explore different quasicrystals by continuously varying the cut angle .",
    "given a periodic lattice , any lower dimensional cross - section of that lattice may be either periodic or quasi - periodic , depending upon the angle of the cross - section .",
    "for example , the periodic 2d cross - sections of a 3d crystal are the lattice planes , defined in crystallography by integer miller indices .",
    "if the miller indices have irrational ratios , on the other hand , the cross - section is aperiodic but still has long - range order because of the underlying higher - dimensional periodicity .",
    "this is what is known as a `` cut - and - project '' method of defining a quasicrystalline structure : as a slice of a periodic structure in a higher - dimensional `` superspace ''  @xcite .",

    "this class includes most commonly considered quasicrystals in two or three dimensions , including the penrose tiling  @xcite , as well as many one - dimensional quasicrystals including a version of the fibonacci structure .",

    "the extrusion window is commonly an inverted projection ( shadow ) of the unit cell onto the @xmath42 directions  @xcite , although this is not the case for the fibonacci construction of fig .",

    "although the cut - and - project technique is a standard way to _ define _ the quasicrystal structure , previous computational studies of photonic quasicrystals then proceeded to simulate the resulting structure only in the projected ( @xmath26-dimensional ) physical space .",
    "instead , it is possible to extend maxwell s equations into the periodic @xmath24-dimensional superspace , where bloch s theorem applies to simplify the computation . by looking at only the unit cell in @xmath24 dimensions",

    "our development of this technique was inspired by earlier research on analogous electronic quasicrystals that applied a tight - binding method in two dimensions to compute the spectrum of a one - dimensional electronic quasicrystal  @xcite .",

    "maxwell s equations can be written as an eigenproblem for the harmonic modes @xmath43  @xcite , where again @xmath40 appears as a parameter .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the curl with respect to the @xmath46 coordinates . assuming that the structure is quasicrystalline , i.e. that @xmath28 is an irrational slice of the periodic superspace @xmath47",
    ", then @xmath48 should not depend upon @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that @xmath40 only determines the offset of the `` initial '' slice of the unit cell ( for @xmath49 ) , but as we reviewed above the slice ( considered in all copies of the unit cell ) fills the unit cell densely .",
    "therefore , any change of @xmath40 can be undone , to arbitrary accuracy , merely by offsetting @xmath46 to a different copy of the unit cell .",
    "an offset of @xmath46 does nt change the eigenvalues @xmath48 , although of course it offsets the eigenfunctions @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that @xmath48 is independent of @xmath40 allows us to re - interpret eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) , without actually changing anything : we can think of @xmath40 as a coordinate rather than a parameter , and the operator on the left - hand side as an operator in @xmath26-dimensional space .",
    "note that @xmath50 is still a three - component vector field , and @xmath45 is still the ordinary curl operator along the @xmath46 directions , so this is not so much a higher - dimensional version of maxwell s equations as an extension of the unmodified ordinary maxwell s equations into a higher - dimensional parameter space .",
    "the @xmath40 coordinate appears in the operator only through @xmath41 .",
    "because @xmath48 is independent of @xmath40 , i.e. it is just a number rather than a function of the coordinates , the equation  ( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) in higher dimensions is still an eigenproblem , and its spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath48 is the same as the spectrum of the @xmath26-dimensional quasicrystal , since the equations are identical . the physical solution is obtained by evaluating these higher - dimensional solutions at a fixed @xmath40 , say @xmath51 ( where a different @xmath40 merely corresponds to an offset in @xmath46 as described above ) .    for a real , positive @xmath41 , both the physical operator and the extended operator in in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) are hermitian and positive semi - definite , leading to many important properties such as real frequencies @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "because the superspace eigenproblem is periodic , bloch s theorem applies : the eigenfunctions @xmath52 can be written in the bloch form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a _ periodic _ function defined by its values in the unit cell , and @xmath55 is the @xmath24-dimensional bloch wavevector  @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath55 determines the phase relationship between @xmath50 in different unit cells of the superspace , but it does not have a simple interpretation once the solution is projected into physical space .",
    "the reason is that @xmath54 , viewed as a function of @xmath46 , is again only quasiperiodic : translation in @xmath46 `` wraps '' the slice into a different portion of the unit cell , so both @xmath54 and @xmath56 change simultaneously and the latter phase can not be easily distinguished .",
    "this prevents one from defining a useful phase or group velocity of the pqc modes .",
    "the key point is that bloch s theorem reduces the eigenproblem to a finite domain ( the @xmath24-dimensional unit cell ) , rather than the infinite domain required to describe the quasicrystal solutions in physical space .",
    "this means that standard numerical methods to find the eigenvalues of differential operators are immediately applicable .",
    "for example , since the solution @xmath54 is periodic , one can apply a planewave expansion method  @xcite for @xmath54 : @xmath57 where the summation is over all @xmath24-dimensional reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath58 . because the curl operations only refer to the @xmath46 coordinates , @xmath59 is replaced by a summation over @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes @xmath58 projected into @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting eigenproblem for the fourier coefficients @xmath62 ( once they are truncated to some wavevector cutoff ) can be computed either by direct dense - matrix methods  @xcite or , more efficiently , by iterative methods exploiting fast fourier transforms  @xcite . in the present paper , we do the former , which is easy to implement as a proof of concept , but for higher - dimensional computations an iterative method will become necessary",
    ".    we should also remind the reader that there is a constraint @xmath63 on the eigenfunctions , in order to exclude unphysical solutions with static magnetic charges . in a planewave method , this leads to a trivial constraint @xmath64 , again with @xmath55 and @xmath58 projected into @xmath28 .      with a familiar eigenproblem arising from bloch s theorem , such as that of a periodic physical structure , the eigenvalues form a band structure : discrete bands @xmath65 that are continuous functions of @xmath55 , with a finite number of bands in any given frequency range  @xcite . for a finite - resolution calculation ,",
    "one obtains a finite number of these bands @xmath66 with some accuracy that increases with resolution , but even at low resolutions the basic structure of the low - frequency bands is readily apparent .",
    "the eigenvalues of the higher - dimensional quasicrystal operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) , on the other hand , are quite different .",
    "the underlying mathematical reason for the discrete band structure of a physical periodic structure is that the bloch eigen - operator for a periodic physical lattice , @xmath67 , is the inverse of a compact integral operator corresponding to the green s function , and hence the spectral theorem applies  @xcite . among other things",
    ", this implies that the eigenvalues at any given @xmath55 for a finite unit cell form a discrete increasing sequence , with a finite number of eigenvalues below any finite @xmath48 .",
    "the same nice property does not hold for the operator extended to @xmath24 dimensions , because along the @xmath40 directions we have no derivatives , only a variation of the scalar function @xmath41 .",
    "intuitively , this means that the fields can oscillate very fast along the @xmath40 directions without necessarily increasing @xmath48 , allowing one to have infinitely many eigenfunctions in a finite bandwidth .",
    "more mathematically , an identity operator is not compact and does not satisfy the spectral theorem  @xcite , and since the operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) is locally the identity along the @xmath40 directions the same conclusion applies .",
    "this means that , when the @xmath40 direction is included as a coordinate , it is possible to get an infinite number of bands in a finite bandwidth at a fixed @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , this is precisely what happens , and moreover it is what _ must _ happen in order to reproduce the well - known properties of quasicrystal spectra . it has been shown that quasicrystal spectra can exhibit a fractal structure  @xcite , with infinitely many gaps ( of decreasing size ) in a finite bandwidth , and such a structure could not arise from an ordinary band diagram with a finite number of bands in a given bandwidth .",
    "of course , once the unit cell is discretized for numerical computation , the number of degrees of freedom and hence the number of eigenvalues is finite",
    ". however , as the resolution is increased , not only do the maximum frequency and the accuracy increase as for an ordinary computation , but also the number of bands in a given bandwidth increases .",

    ", the small number of spurious bands within the gaps , which arise from the discretization as discussed below , plays no significant role : the density of states is dominated by the huge number of flat bands ( going to infinity as the resolution is increased ) , and the addition of one or two spurious bands is negligible .",
    "the `` spurious '' bands that appear within some of the band gaps of the superspace calculation arise from the discretization of the dielectric interfaces parallel to the slice direction .",
    "because the slice is at an irrational angle , it will never align precisely with a uniform grid , resulting in inevitable staircasing effects at the boundary . with ordinary electromagnetic simulations",
    ", these staircasing effects can degrade the accuracy  @xcite , but here the lack of derivatives perpendicular to the slice allows spurious modes to appear along these staircased edges ( there is no frequency penalty to being localized perpendicular to the slice ) .",
    "indeed , if one looks at the field patterns for the spurious modes , one of which is shown in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : band - negro](right ) , one sees that the field intensity is peaked along the slice - parallel dielectric interfaces .",
    "because they are localized to these interfaces and therefore dominated by the unphysical staircasing , the spurious modes behave quite differently from the `` real '' solutions and are easily distinguished qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "most importantly , as the resolution is increased , the number of spurious modes in a given gap does not increase like all of the other bands , because the thickness of the staircased interface region decreases proportional to the resolution .",
    "this makes the gaps in the band structure obvious : here , they are the only frequency ranges for which the number of eigenvalues does not increase with resolution .",

    "this makes the structure @xmath40-independent even for rational slices  @xcite the resulting structures are shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] for three values of @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding photonic band gaps are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] , as a continuous function of @xmath17 .",
    "only the largest gaps are shown , of course , since we are unable to resolve the fractal structure to arbitrary resolution . as might be expected ,",
    "there are isolated large gaps at @xmath94 and @xmath95 corresponding to the simple @xmath96 periodic structures at those angles ( with period @xmath85 and @xmath97 , respectively , the latter resulting from two layers per unit cell ) .",
    "the @xmath95 gap is at a higher frequency because of its shorter period , but interestingly it is not continuously connected to the @xmath94 gap .",
    "the reason for this seems to be that the two gaps are dominated by different superspace reciprocal lattice vectors : @xmath98 for @xmath99 , and @xmath100 for @xmath101 . for intermediate angles , a number of smaller gaps open and then close .",
    "if we were able to show the spectrum with higher resolution , we would expect to see increasing numbers of these smaller gaps opening , leading to the well - known fractal structure that arises e.g. for the fibonacci crystal .",
    "this variation of gaps as a function of @xmath17 provides interesting possibilities for band - gap engineering .",
    "first , we see that we can get large gaps that are close to one another in the spectrum , whereas in a typical one - dimensional quarter - wave stack the gaps are at integer multiples of a given frequency  @xcite .",
    "even more complex combinations of gaps may arise for higher dimensional superspaces , since by including additional incommensurate reciprocal lattice vectors one may generate additional nearby gaps .",
    "yet another interesting possibility would involve optimizing the layer thicknesses as a function of @xmath17 so as to maximize the largest band gap at every @xmath17 ( or some other objective ) .",
    "the dielectric layers chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi ] were of fixed thickness @xmath102 ( and variable height equal to the projection of the unit cell along the @xmath42 direction as described above ) .",
    "we have presented a numerical approach to computing the spectra of photonic quasicrystals by directly solving maxwell s equations extended to a periodic unit cell in higher dimensions , allowing us to exploit bloch s theorem and other attractive properties of computations for periodic structures . in doing so",
    ", we extended the conceptual approach of cut - and - project techniques , which were developed as a way to _ construct _ quasicrystals , into a way to _ simulate _ quasicrystals .",
    "compared to traditional supercell techniques , this allows us to capture the entire infinite aperiodic quasicrystal in a single finite computational cell , albeit at only a finite resolution . in this way",
    ", the single convergence parameter of spatial resolution replaces the combination of resolution and supercell size in traditional calculations , in some sense uniformly sampling the infinite quasicrystal .",
    "the resulting computations , applied to the test case of a fibonacci quasicrystal , display the unique features of quasicrystals in an unusual fashion , in terms of higher - dimensional band structures and visualization techniques .",
    "this technique also allows defects and variation of cut angle ( continuously varying between periodic and aperiodic structures ) in a straightforward way .    in future work",
    ", we plan to apply this approach to modeling higher - dimensional quasicrystal structures , where computing the spectrum is currently more challenging using existing supercell techniques .",
    "to make a higher - dimensional superspace calculation practical , one must use iterative eigensolver methods  @xcite rather than the simple dense - matrix techniques employed for our test case .",
    "iterative techniques are most efficient for computing a few eigenvalues at a time , and so it will be useful to employ iterative methods designed to compute `` interior '' eigenvalues  @xcite , allowing one to search directly for large gaps without computing the lower - lying modes . alternatively , numerical techniques have been developed , based on filter - diagonalization methods , to directly extract the spectrum of many eigenvalues without computing the corresponding eigenvectors  @xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we give an explicit derivation of the fact that an `` irrational '' slice densely fills the superspace unit cell , or rather a definition of the necessary conditions to be an `` irrational '' slice .",
    "these concepts are widely used in the quasicrystal literature , but a precise definition seems hard to find ( one commonly requires that all of the miller indices have incommensurate ratios , but this condition is stronger than necessary ) .    without loss of generality , we can consider the unit cell in the superspace @xmath103 to be the unit cube ( related to any lattice by an affine transformation ) with lattice vectors along the coordinate directions .",
    "the physical slice @xmath28 is @xmath26-dimensional , and it will be convenient to write the coordinates of a vector @xmath104 as @xmath105 . by taking every coordinate modulo @xmath1 , we can map @xmath28 to a set @xmath106 consisting of @xmath28 s intersection with each unit cell .",
    "we wish to show necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath106 to densely fill the unit cell .",

    "consider the set @xmath109 in @xmath114 formed by the @xmath115 coordinates of @xmath28 when the components of @xmath116 take on integer values .",
    "this is a subset of @xmath28 , and the corresponding set @xmath110 formed by taking @xmath117 modulo  1 is a subset of @xmath106 .",
    "the key fact is that @xmath106 is dense in the @xmath24-dimensional unit cell if and only if @xmath110 is dense in the @xmath118-dimensional unit cell , and this is the case that we will analyze .",
    "this equivalence follows from the fact that @xmath106 is simply @xmath110 translated continuously along the slice directions ( every point in @xmath106 is related to a point in @xmath110 by a simple projection ) .",
    "the set @xmath109 is a lattice in @xmath114 consisting of all integer linear combinations of the basis vectors @xmath119 , since @xmath115 is a linear function .    for each basis vector @xmath120 , it is a well - known fact  @xcite that if it consists of @xmath121 incommensurate irrational components , the set of integer multiples @xmath122 modulo  1 will densely fill an @xmath121-dimensional slice of the unit cell .",
    "more precisely , write @xmath123 , where the @xmath124 and @xmath125 have purely rational components and the @xmath126 are incommensurate irrational numbers , and @xmath127 is therefore the number of incommensurate irrational components of @xmath120 .",
    "then the set of integer multiples of @xmath120 modulo  1 densely fills an @xmath127-dimensional slice of the unit cell of @xmath114 .",
    "the basis vectors of this slice are precisely the vectors @xmath124 , which are rational and therefore commensurate with the basis vectors of @xmath114 , while the vector @xmath125 is simply a rational shift .",
    "this slice therefore cuts the unit cell of @xmath114 a finite number of times .",
    "the set @xmath110 is then obtained as the direct sum of these dense slices for all @xmath30 vectors @xmath120 .",
    "this is then dense if and only if the set of vectors @xmath128 spans @xmath114 .",
    "in other words , an `` irrational slice , '' which densely fills the unit cell , is one in which there are @xmath30 independent incommensurate slice components as defined above .",
