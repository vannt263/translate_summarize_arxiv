    "the na48/2 beam line has been designed to deliver simultaneous narrow momentum band @xmath11 and @xmath12 beams originating from the collision of the primary 400 gev/@xmath13 protons extracted from the cern sps on a beryllium target .",
    "secondary beams with central momenta of @xmath14 ( r.m.s . ) following a common beam axis were used .",
    "the beam kaons decayed in a fiducial decay volume contained in a 114  m long cylindrical vacuum tank .",
    "the momenta of charged decay products were measured in a magnetic spectrometer , housed in a tank filled with helium placed after the decay volume .",
    "the spectrometer comprised four drift chambers ( dchs ) and a dipole magnet .",
    "a plastic scintillator hodoscope ( chod ) producing fast trigger signals and providing precise time measurements of charged particles was placed after the spectrometer .",
    "further downstream was a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr ) , an almost homogeneous ionization chamber with an active volume of 7  m@xmath15 of liquid krypton , @xmath16 deep , segmented transversally into 13248 projective @xmath17  @xmath18 cells and with no longitudinal segmentation .",
    "an iron / scintillator hadronic calorimeter and muon detectors were located further downstream .",
    "a dedicated two - level trigger was used to collect three track decays with a very high efficiency .",
    "a detailed description of the detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0decay proceeds through virtual photon exchange which undergoes internal conversion into electron - positron pair , i.e. @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 is produced by two different mechanisms : inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) , where the @xmath22 is emitted by one of the charged mesons in the initial or final state and direct emission ( de ) when @xmath22 is radiated off at the weak vertex of the intermediate state . as a consequence",
    "the differential decay width consists of three terms : the dominant long - distance ib contribution ( pure electric part e ) , the de component ( electric e and magnetic m parts ) and the interference between them@xcite .",
    "the interference term collects the different contributions , ibe , ibm and em . for this reason the @xmath21decay offers interesting short and long distance parity violating observables . in the @xmath23 mode",
    "the interference consists only of the ibe term@xcite , because the remaining ( em ) interferences are p - violating , but cancel out upon angular integration .",
    "there are few theoretical publications related to the @xmath0@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "recently authors of @xmath24 where able to predict , on the basis of the na48/2 measurement of the magnetic and electric terms in @xmath25 @xcite , the branching ratio of the single components .",
    "no experimental observation has so far been reported .",
    "@xmath0event candidates are reconstructed from three charged tracks and two photons , forming neutral pion , pointing to a common vertex in the fiducial decay volume .",
    "particle identification is based on the energy deposition in lkr ( e ) associated or not to a charged track momentum ( p ) measured in the spectrometer .",
    "the charged track is identified as electron / positron if its e / p ratio is greater than 0.85 , and as a charged pion if the e / p ratio is lower than 0.85 .",

    "the large sample of @xmath26 mesons produced and decaying in vacuum collected by na48/2 allows for a high sensitivity search for the dark photon ( @xmath4 ) , a new gauge boson introduced in hidden sector new physics models with an extra @xmath56 gauge symmetry . in a rather general set of models , the interaction of the dark photon ( dp ) with the ordinary matter is through kinetic mixing with the standard model hypercharge @xmath56  @xcite . in these models , the new coupling constant @xmath57 is proportional to the electric charge and the dark photon couples in exactly the same way to quarks and leptons .",
    "these scenarios could provide an explanation to the observed rise in the cosmic - ray positron fraction with energy , and could offer an explanation to the muon gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath58 ) anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the simplest dp model is characterised by two free parameters , the dp mass @xmath9 and the mixing parameter with the standard model @xmath57 .",
    "its possible production in the @xmath26 decay and subsequent decay proceed via the following chain : @xmath5 ,   @xmath6 ,   @xmath7 , producing a final state with three charged particles and a photon .",

    "the na48/2 3-track vertex reconstruction does not introduce significant acceptance losses as the typical resolution on the vertex longitudinal coordinate is @xmath70  m. the dp signature is identical to that of the dalitz decay @xmath71 , which therefore represents an irreducible background and limits the sensitivity . the largest @xmath72 sample , and therefore the largest sensitivity , is obtained form the study of the @xmath3 decays .      the full na48/2 data sample is used for the analysis .",
    "the @xmath33 event selection requires a three - track vertex reconstructed in the fiducial decay region formed of a pion ( @xmath73 ) candidate track and two opposite - sign electron ( @xmath74 ) candidate tracks .",
    "charged particle identification is based on the ratio of energy deposition in the lkr calorimeter to the momentum measured by the spectrometer , which should be smaller ( greater ) than 0.85 for pion ( electron ) candidates .",
    "furthermore , a single isolated lkr energy deposition cluster is required as the photon candidate .",

    "the candidates mainly originate from @xmath33 decays , with 0.15% coming from the semileptonic @xmath78 decays ( denoted @xmath79 below ) . correcting the observed number of candidates for acceptance and trigger efficiency",
    ", the total number of @xmath10 decays in the 98  m long fiducial decay region for the analyzed data sample is found to be @xmath80 , where the quoted error is dominated by the external uncertainty on the @xmath72 decay branching fraction @xmath81 .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath76 invariant mass ( @xmath82 ) spectrum of the @xmath33 candidates is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mee ] .",

    "the @xmath72 decay is simulated using the lowest - order differential decay rate in  @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections to the differential rate are implemented following the approach of mikaelian and smith  @xcite recently revised to improve the numerical precision  @xcite .",
    "the method introduces only weights @xmath84 and does not account for the emission of inner bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "a search for the dp is performed assuming different mass hypotheses with a variable mass step .",
    "the mass step of the scan and the width of the signal mass window around the assumed dp mass are determined by the resolution on the @xmath76 invariant mass .",
    "the mass step of the dp scan is set to be @xmath85 , while the signal region mass window for each dp mass hypothesis is defined as @xmath86 around the assumed mass ( both the scan step and the mass window half - width are rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.02 mev/@xmath28 ) .",
    "the mass window width has been optimised with mc simulations to obtain the highest sensitivity to the dp signal , determined by a trade - off between @xmath72 background fluctuation and signal acceptance .    in total",
    ", 398 dp mass hypotheses are tested in the range @xmath87 .",
