    "the logic state at the gate is encoded in the strength of the local magnetic field , such that the transistor is insulating ( conducting ) if the logical state of the gate is 1 ( 0 ) . here , we propose to use the magnetic dipole field @xmath226 due to the excess @xmath227 accumulated magnons in the 1-state of the relevant terminal as gate - field at the points a - c in fig .",

    "the fidelity of a single nand - gate exceeds 99.9% .",
    "in this section , we will discuss several different requirements that have to be fulfilled for our perturbative calculations of the tunneling current through the molecular magnet to be valid .",
    "the first constraint on our calculations concerns the validity of our spin wave analysis of the fm spin chains ; the number of magnons per site has to satisfy @xmath268 . in our calculations , the average number of magnons per site is typically   0.05 - 0.13 , so that non - interaction spin wave theory is valid .",
    "the af theory is valid for energies much smaller than the exchange interaction @xmath138 .",
    "we checked the validity of our sequential tunneling approach in a self - consistent manner .",
    "for the af reservoirs , the criterion is simply that the tunneling current is much smaller than the current in the ballistic system , that is @xmath269 . for the fm reservoirs , we require that the broadening of the energy levels of the molecule is smaller than the unperturbed level splitting . in other words , all transition rates @xmath270 of the fm system satisfy @xmath271 where @xmath272 , @xmath273 are the unperturbed energies of the states @xmath76 , @xmath274 .",
    "another constraint is given by the fact that , near breit - wigner resonances , the current through the molecular magnet can be strongly increased due to coherent tunneling processes .",
    "this only holds at low temperatures , at higher temperatures the broadening of the thermal distribution destroys coherent tunneling , and the sequential tunneling approach is valid again . the minimal temperature @xmath156 for fm reservoirs is given by @xmath275 all our calculations are at high enough temperature for the sequential tunneling approach to be valid for the fm system .",
    "we note that relaxation of the state of the molecular magnet can be neglected as long as the coupling strength between the reservoirs and the molecular magnet exceeds the coupling between the molecular magnet and hyperfine- and phonon baths .",
    "using a sequential tunneling approach , we have studied transport of magnons and spinons through a triangular molecular magnet which is weakly coupled to two spin reservoirs .",
    "we have shown that , by changing the state of the molecular magnet through application of an electric- or magnetic field , we can control the magnitude of the spin current through the molecular magnet .",
    "we used this fact to propose a magnon - transistor , whose operation can be controlled by an electric- or magnetic field .",
    "we have shown for which parameters our transistor could operate at room temperature with a  11 ns switching time .",
    "we have shown how several magnon - transistors can be combined to create a nand - gate .",
