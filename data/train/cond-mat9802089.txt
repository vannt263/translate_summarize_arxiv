    "<S> an impressive series@xcite of c - axis optical reflectivity measurements by uchida and co - workers on single - crystal @xmath2 ( lsco ) systems shows the following salient features in the frequency dependence of the electronic reflectivity : ( 1 ) for temperatures @xmath3 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , in the normal phases , the c - axis optical reflectivity is essentially structureless down to 20 @xmath4 ( the lowest frequency studied in ref . ) , and the data resemble that of an ionic insulator ; ( 2 ) in the superconducting phase , for @xmath5 , the reflectivity develops a well - defined sharp plasma edge with the effective plasma frequency , @xmath6 ( defined as the frequency where the real part of the dielectric function goes through a zero , re@xmath7 ) , being below the superconducting energy gap @xmath8 ( in fact , @xmath9 in optimally doped lsco )  thus the superconducting state exhibits a classic `` metallic '' optical reflectivity behavior in contrast to the normal state `` insulating '' behavior ; ( 3 ) the very low c - axis plasma frequency ( below the energy gap ) associated with the observed reflectivity plasma edge corresponds to a carrier mass substantially larger than the c - axis optical mass obtained in standard band structure calculations , _ i.e. , _ the experimental @xmath6 is much smaller , by more than an order of magnitude , than the corresponding local - density - approximation ( lda ) band structure calculated value ; ( 4 ) the superconducting state plasma edge shows a characteristic temperature dependence , becoming weaker ( and @xmath10 shifting to lower frequency with increasing temperature ) as @xmath11 approaches @xmath1 from below ; ( 5 ) the plasma edge shows a strong doping dependence . </S>",
    "<S> it has been emphasized that these anomalies , in particular , items ( 1)-(3 ) above , are very difficult to understand on the basis of the standard fermi liquid bcs - type generic theories of high temperature superconductors .    in the theoretical work presented here </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the c - axis reflectivity of the layered cuprate materials by calculating the appropriate long wavelength dynamical dielectric function @xmath12 of the system . in calculating the long wavelength frequency </S>",
    "<S> dependent dielectric function we use the nambu - gorkov formalism@xcite and carry out a fully gauge invariant self - consistent finite temperature linear response calculation @xcite including `` impurity scattering '' induced level broadening effects in the theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our theory , therefore , corresponds to the one@xcite developed by fertig and das sarma for anisotropic layered superconducting systems except for three important generalizations beyond ref . : </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) we use a finite temperature formalism in contrast to the @xmath13 case studied in ref . , </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) we use the d - wave order parameter symmetry for the superconducting ground state in our response calculation @xcite in contrast to the @xmath14-wave model used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( this turns out to be unimportant in understanding reflectivity measurements ) , and ( 3 ) we include level broadening effects in our microscopic calculation in contrast to ref . which neglected disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the @xmath15-wave symmetry makes negligible difference@xcite with respect to the @xmath14-wave symmetry in our long wavelength dielectric response calculation ( there are substantial differences@xcite at large wave vectors , which are not of any significance to optical reflectivity measurements ) . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of level broadening in the dynamical dielectric function is , however , crucial in understanding the c - axis reflectivity measurements  in particular , strong disorder scattering in these systems , as reflected in their anomalously high c - axis @xmath0 resistivities for @xmath3 , gives rise to an overdamped plasmon in the normal state , completely suppressing any normal state metallic plasma edge for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a plasma edge in the superconducting state corresponding to the c - axis anderson - bogoliubov plasma mode@xcite is , however , preserved because single particle level broadening does not affect the condensed carriers in the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume@xcite a simple single tight binding band ( of bandwidth @xmath16 ) along the c - axis and take the single - particle energy dispersion to be @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wave vector in the @xmath19 plane ( with @xmath20 as the planar effective mass for charge dynamics in the @xmath19 plane ) , @xmath15 is the c - axis layer separation , and @xmath21 the wave vector along the c - axis . following refs . </S>",
    "<S> and we carry out a self - consistent ( and gauge invariant ) linear response calculation for the dynamical dielectric function @xmath12 treating the long range coulomb interaction ( in the highly anisotropic layered system ) in the random phase approximation ( `` bubble '' diagrams ) and the bcs - like short - range pairing interaction in the ladder approximation ( which is a conserving approximation because the bcs self - energy producing the superconductivity is a hartree - fock single - loop self - energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> we include level broadening effects both in the single - particle green s function and in the vertex correction through the ladder impurity diagrams@xcite . assuming the impurity scattering to be short - ranged and isotropic , we can parameterize the disorder strength by a single level broadening parameter ( _ i.e. , _ an imaginary part of the self - energy ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , with @xmath24 throughout , is the transport relaxation time for the c - axis normal transport properties . thus in principle , the normal state c - axis resistivity @xmath25 of the system defined @xmath22 within our model . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated microscopic @xmath12 therefore depends on @xmath22 , @xmath11 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 ( which are determined @xcite by the strength of the pairing interaction in our bcs model ) as well as on the effective single - particle parameters @xmath20 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the results depend also on a number of obvious parameters such as the two - dimensional carrier density @xmath27 ( which determines the density of states ) , the layer separation @xmath15 in the c - direction , and the effective background dielectric constant @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> our philosophy at this stage is to treat @xmath22 and @xmath26 , the two most contentious parameters in our theory , as unknown parameters , and take the other parameters from the best available experimental ( and where appropriate , from band structure ) results . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the details of the pairing interaction or the impurity potential do not affect our reflectivity results in any qualitative way .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show our calculated c - axis optical reflectivity to be compared directly with the experimental results of tamasaku _ et . al._@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have use parameters corresponding to lsco except for @xmath26 and @xmath22 which are varied to produce different curves in fig . [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated results look _ very similar _ to the experimental observations ( see , for example , fig . 1 in ref . ) , and in fact our theory agrees with the measurements _ quantitatively _ if we treat @xmath26 and @xmath22 as phenomenological parameters and choose @xmath29 and @xmath30 . typically we find the plasma edge @xmath31 in the superconducting state , and provided @xmath30 no plasma edge shows up in the normal state with the normal state reflectivity remaining essentially constant around 0.5 ( exactly as in the experimental results of ref . ) down to rather low frequencies ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that if the normal state reflectivity measurement is pushed down to rather low frequencies ( @xmath33 or below ) , one would see a rise in the reflectivity as it would increase to unity to be consistent with there being a finite ( albeit very low ) @xmath0 conductivity along the c - axis .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from the results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] that to get agreement with the experimental measurements@xcite within our model one must have a very low ( high ) value of the c - axis hopping amplitude @xmath26 ( level broadening parameter @xmath22 ) . in particular , our theory gives @xmath34 in the superconducting state , which constraints @xmath26 to be in the range of 20 - 30 @xmath4 in lsco for the theory to be quantitatively consistent with the experimental measurement in ref . which finds a sharp reflectivity plasma edge in the 30 - 60 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the other striking experimental anomaly@xcite of the nonexistence of any reflectivity plasma edge in the normal state is `` explained '' in our theory by having a large damping or broadening term @xmath22 ( @xmath35 ) which enters our microscopic impurity scattering diagrams in the dynamical polarizability function . </S>",
    "<S> we have so far treated @xmath26 and @xmath22 as phenomenological parameters , and the crucial issue therefore is to justify ( or , at least provide a rationale for ) having such small ( high ) values of @xmath26 ( @xmath22 ) in layered high temperature superconducting systems . </S>",
    "<S> this , in fact , was the basis of the trenchant analysis of the experimental results@xcite carried out by anderson@xcite , which led him to conclude@xcite that a standard fermi liquid - bcs type analysis ( exactly of the type we carry out in this work ) is incapable of explaining the experimental c - axis reflectivity data .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work we treat @xmath26 and @xmath22 as phenomenological parameters to be fixed by _ normal state _ @xmath0 transport properties of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> we use the _ measured _ values of normal state @xmath25 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 to fix @xmath26 and @xmath22 within the standard fermi liquid picture . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping amplitude @xmath26 is then given simply by the formula @xmath38 the level broadening @xmath22 is given simply by the c - axis @xmath0 resistivity through the usual relaxation time approximation in the tight binding limit : @xmath39 the simple drude - boltzmann - fermi liquid formulae given by eqs . ( [ tc ] ) and ( [ gam ] ) immediately explain why the hopping parameter @xmath26 ( the level broadening parameter @xmath22 ) is extremely small ( large )  both of these anomalies arise from the anomalously large c - axis resistivity , which is a universal feature for the layered cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we should emphasize two significant aspects of the phenomenological analysis giving as the all - important parameters @xmath26 and @xmath22 ( from the normal state @xmath0 resistivities of the system ) : ( 1 ) standard lda band structure calculations@xcite give values of @xmath26 which are one to two orders of magnitude larger than those given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tc ] ) for layered cuprates ( while the two dimensional electron density and the effective mass in the @xmath19 plane seem to be reasonably , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , within a factor of two , well - described by lda band calculations@xcite ) ; ( 2 ) our drude - fermi liquid phenomenological description characterized by eqs . ( </S>",
    "<S> [ tc ] ) and ( [ gam ] ) is completely independent of the actual normal state transport mechanism along the c - axis and depends only on the crucial observation that the normal state @xmath0 transport along the c - axis is `` metallic '' around optimal doping ( albeit with an anomalously large imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath22 ) .    in table 1 </S>",
    "<S> we summarize our results for a number of layered cuprates , giving the values of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath22 ( obtained from experimental @xmath25 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 ) used in our calculations to obtain @xmath6 at @xmath13 , the long wavelength c - axis anderson - bogoliubov plasmon frequency in the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> in carrying out our microscopic calculation for the `` multilayer '' cuprates ( _ e.g. _ ybco , bisco ) , which contain more than one cuo layers per unit cell , we are concentrating here only on the low frequency c - axis plasma properties which arise from the _ intercell _ hopping , neglecting the mode mixing effects arising from the _ intracell _ hopping between the cuo layers . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to making an effective single layer model for these multilayer cuprates , which should suffice for the c - axis reflectivity properties . from the available experimental results given in table 1 it </S>",
    "<S> is clear that our phenomenological theory , utilizing the normal state @xmath0 resistivities as the input parameters for the microscopic calculation of the dielectric response , gives a good semiquantitative description of the c - axis optical measurements in cuprate superconductors . understanding the strong doping dependence of the data in ref . </S>",
    "<S> requires a more complicated phenomenological model@xcite for @xmath26 and @xmath22 because @xmath25 shows , in general , complex doping dependence .    finally , we point out that a simple phenomenological casimir - gorter two fluid description works remarkably well for this problem . writing </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical dielectric function @xmath12 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the normal ( superconducting ) fluid c - axis plasma frequency in the tight binding description obtained respectively from the normal ( superconducting ) carrier density , we can calculate ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) the c - axis optical reflectivity . </S>",
    "<S> these results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] look qualitatively similar to our microscopic results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( the detailed temperature dependences in the two descriptions are somewhat different . ) </S>",
    "<S> the physical picture that emerges from our work is thus simple : large level broadening due to strong scattering ( large @xmath22 ) in the normal state associated with `` incoherent '' transport@xcite along the c - axis overdamps the normal state c - axis plasmon preventing the formation of a reflectivity edge and producing fairly structureless normal state reflectivity whereas the superconducting carriers , being unaffected by scattering effects , give rise to a sharp reflectivity edge associated with the well - defined anderson - bogoliubov c - axis plasmon which lies in the superconducting gap due to weak interlayer carrier hopping in the layered cuprate systems . </S>"
