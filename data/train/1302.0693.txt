    "a central assumption underlying both classical and quantum physics is that its basic laws are _ local _ , i.e. , that the fundamental equations can be expressed in terms of relations between physical observables at a given point in space and time  @xcite . symmetries and different types of order are thus related to the behavior of correlation functions of local observables . in particular , a qualitative change in macroscopic properties is typically associated with the appearance of long range order in some local observable @xmath2 .",

    "moreover , thanks to the direct accessibility of the atomic distribution by optical imaging methods which allow measuring in situ density distributions  @xcite and even arbitrary density correlations at the single - atom level  @xcite , they also provide a new perspective on the microscopic details of the involved states .",
    "the question of whether some non - local order exists in the mi phase of bosons in an optical lattice has been addressed before by berg et al .",
    "@xcite in the particular case of one dimension .",
    "while their main focus has been the study of hidden string - order that appears in the presence of repulsive interactions of finite range , they have shown via bosonization that even in the much simpler situation of pure on - site repulsion , there is a non - local observable which takes finite values in the mi and is zero in the sf .",
    "using single site imaging , the associated parity order parameter ( pop ) has been measured by endres et al .",

    "their results were consistent with the theoretical expectation of a non - vanishing parity order in the mi and an algebraic decay to zero in the superfluid phase .",

    "this mapping has first been discussed by peskin  @xcite starting from the classical three - dimensional xy model and has been extended to the two - dimensional quantum xy model by fisher and lee  @xcite . as will be shown here",
    ", the parity order parameter is mapped in the dual model on a quantity which is more local by one dimension : in @xmath6 , it is mapped on a two - point correlation function for a local operator of the type in eq .   which shows an algebraic decay in the sf phase and converges to a constant in the mi .",
    "in the @xmath7 case , the pop is mapped onto an equal time wilson loop in the dual gauge theory , which serves to distinguish the superfluid and mott insulating phases according to the dependence on the system size @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we find a perimeter law dependence in the mi phase which leads to an exponential decay of the pop while in the sf phase a logarithmic correction to the perimeter law leads to a super - exponential decay .",

    ", the fundamental difference between the superfluid and mott insulating phase in terms of their compressibility implies that there is a non - local observable which behaves in a characteristically different manner in both phases . by a straightforward generalization of the parity order in 1d introduced by berg et al .",

    "there are two important properties of this observable which should be noted right away : first of all , the observable is easily accessible in experiments since , due to light - induced collision losses , quantum gas microscopes directly measure the on - site parity rather than the actual occupation numbers  @xcite . as a second point , the observable must be calculated and measured in an _ open _ domain @xmath37 which is part of a larger system , otherwise @xmath39 would trivially be equal to one due to conservation of particle number . to study the dependence on the size , we shall characterize the domain @xmath37by its linear extension @xmath8 measured in units of the lattice spacing . in analogy to the standard definition of long range order , the parity order parameter ( pop ) exhibits long range order if @xmath40 is finite .",
    "this kind of order parameter is analogous to those studied in ising models with a local gauge invariance , which have no conventional phase transitions to states with long range order , yet may exhibit different phases distinguished by non - local order parameters  @xcite ( see also section  [ sec : outlook ] ) .",
    "in the context of cold atoms , a more complicated string order parameter was introduced , which characterizes a haldane insulator that can form in one dimensional systems with longer range interactions  @xcite .",
    "our focus is on the behavior of the parity order parameter at the conventional sf ",
    "mi transition , not only in 1d  @xcite but also in 2d .",
    "in particular , we will use a duality transformation to show that in two dimensions parity order is related to an equal time wilson loop in a non - trivial @xmath0 gauge theory which exhibits different behavior as a function of system size @xmath8 in the mi and sf phases .",
    "the grid lines indicate the lattice , bosons are represented by small circles .",
    "the domain @xmath41 , here taken to be a square , is shaded in gray .",

    "it is obvious that @xmath43 in any dimension since particle fluctuations are then completely frozen . for small but finite @xmath16 and for the simple case of a mi with average density @xmath44",
    ", particle number fluctuations appear as pairs of empty and doubly occupied sites .",
    "now , for an arbitrary number of pairs which are completely inside the domain @xmath37 , the associated two minus signs in the product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) cancel . only those pairs which are separated by the domain boundary lead to a reduction of   @xcite .",
    "intuitively one thus expects the parity order @xmath45 to scale exponentially with the area of the domain s boundary .",
    "this intuitive expectation is supported by a systematic perturbative calculation in an expansion around the atomic limit @xmath46 which  as will be shown in section  [ sec : pert ] below ",
    "yields @xmath47 up to second order in @xmath42 .",
    "clearly the expansion is well defined only in @xmath6 , while in higher dimensions the effective expansion parameter @xmath48 is small only up to system sizes of order @xmath49 .",
    "further insight into the origin of the perimeter law for the decay of the parity order can be gained by assuming that the expectation value in  ( [ eq : op ] ) may be calculated within a gaussian approximation such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 . within this approximation ,",
    "@xmath52 is simply a measure of the total number fluctuations @xmath53 in a domain of size @xmath8 as part of an infinite system .",
    "now , the standard thermodynamic relation @xmath54 in this effectively grand canonical situation seems to indicate that these fluctuations vanish at zero temperature which would imply a trivial result @xmath55 in the gaussian approximation .",
    "this is not true , however , because the relation only applies in the thermodynamic limit and neglects boundary terms . for a careful calculation of @xmath53 at zero temperature and in a finite system",
    ", we generalize the analysis of giorgini et al .",
    "( @xcite , see also  @xcite ) for bose gases in a @xmath56 continuum to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the particle number fluctuations @xmath57 in a spherical domain of radius @xmath8 can then be calculated from the pair distribution function @xmath58 and the volume @xmath59 of the intersection between two @xmath60-dimensional balls of radius @xmath8 separated by the distance @xmath61 . here , @xmath62 is the surface of a unit sphere in @xmath60 dimensions while @xmath63 is the standard static structure factor .    in the superfluid , the zero temperature static structure factor has the non - analytic behavior @xmath64 at small wave numbers , characteristic for any compressible phase .",
    "since collective excitations exhaust the @xmath65sum rule for long wavelengths , the prefactor @xmath66 is , moreover , completely fixed by the exact sound velocity @xmath67 . as a result of the non - analytic behavior of @xmath63 , the associated pair distribution function exhibits an algebraic decay @xmath68 in @xmath6 and @xmath69 in @xmath7 at long distances .",
    "the behavior of the number fluctuations for large @xmath8 is then found to be @xmath70 where the effective healing length @xmath71 serves as a short - distance cutoff . within the gaussian approximation",
    ", therefore , the parity order @xmath72 decays to zero with a power law in the superfluid phase in one dimension while in two dimensions , the decay is super - exponential .    in the mi phase , the quadratic number fluctuations are much smaller and the scaling of @xmath73 with system size @xmath8 differs in a qualitative manner from that in the sf .",
    "indeed , at zero temperature , incompressibility of the mi implies that the structure factor vanishes analytically for @xmath74 and thus @xmath75 to leading order in an expansion around @xmath76 . here",
    ", @xmath77 is the characteristic length of the exponential decay of the one - particle density matrix mentioned in the previous section , while @xmath78 is a numerical constant which relates the scales appearing in the density correlation and in the one - particle density matrix . from perturbation theory",
    ", one finds that in one dimension @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath79 to leading order  @xcite .",
    "since the static structure factor is analytic around @xmath80 , the pair correlation function @xmath81 decays exponentially on the characteristic scale @xmath77 , effectively cutting off the integral in eq .  .",
    "as a result , one finds that @xmath82 scales like the area of the boundary of the domain with a coefficient @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a numerical constant depending on the geometry and the precise functional form of @xmath85 .",
    "the results obtained within this gaussian approximation are  of course  not exact . yet , as will be shown in sections  [ sec : dual1d ] and [ sec : dual2d ] below , they give the correct qualitative behavior of the parity order parameter as a function of the size @xmath8 of the domain . on a basic level , therefore , the different behavior of the non - local parity order in the mi and the sf is a simple consequence of the fundamental difference between number fluctuations in an incompressible versus a compressible system  @xcite . in this context , it is also instructive to note that the underlying scaling @xmath86 of the number fluctuations in the compressible and gapless superfluid compared to @xmath87 in the incompressible and gapped mi are reminiscent of similar results obtained for the scaling of the entanglement entropy @xmath88 .",
    "the fact that the fluctations of conserved quantities are closely related to the latter , exhibiting a simple area law for gapped phases , has been noted by swingle and senthil  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , a number of important differences : the entanglement entropy typically scales like @xmath89 with a non - universal prefactor @xmath90 even in gapless phases while the corresponding number fluctuations @xmath73 have an additional logarithmic enhancement factor for any phase with a finite compressibility . for the entanglement entropy , violations of the area law by a logarithmic factor of the form @xmath91 appear , e.g. , in free fermions with a fermi surface and also for landau fermi liquids , not in a gapless superfluid , however .",
    "indeed , as noted by metlitski and grover  @xcite , its entanglement entropy @xmath92 exhibits an _",
    "additive_not multiplicative  logarithmic contribution @xmath93 which is universal , i.e. , it only depends on the superfluid stiffness @xmath94 and the sound velocity @xmath67 as effective low energy constants .    the simplicity of the gaussian approximation for studying the parity order also allows for a straightforward discussion of how the above results are affected by a finite temperature .",
    "for a neutral sf , the structure factor at temperatures @xmath95 reads  @xcite @xmath96 .",
    "the characteristic length scale at which the zero temperature result @xmath64 is equal to the @xmath80 thermal value @xmath97 is therefore given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the thermal wavelength and @xmath71 the effective healing length . since the parity order effectively probes number fluctuations at a finite wave vector @xmath100 the zero temperature results remain valid as long as @xmath101 . since typical values of the healing length are of order @xmath102 m , the characteristic scale of @xmath103 becomes larger than a lattice spacing at temperatures below @xmath104nk .",
    "an equivalent reasoning can be applied in the mott insulating phase , where the thermal behavior of the structure factor @xmath105 involves the compressiblity @xmath106 . for dimensional reasons ,",
    "the latter must be of the form @xmath107 with the mott gap @xmath29 and a function @xmath108 which has a thermally activated form .",
    "the zero temperature results are then valid as long as the domain size @xmath8 satisfies @xmath109 in the interesting regime @xmath110 this is easily satisfied due to the exponential form of @xmath111 .",
    "the actual constraint is rather the condition @xmath112 which becomes increasingly hard to satisfy as one approaches the critical point .",
    "deep in the mi , where @xmath42 , exact results for the parity order can be obtained by a systematic perturbation theory around the atomic limit @xmath113 of the bose - hubbard model . here",
    "we make use of a method developed by van dongen  @xcite , which is an extension of a formalism due to harris and lange  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to construct a canonical transformation of the creation and annihilation operators , @xmath114 with an anti - hermitian generator @xmath115 such that in the new basis , the occupation numbers and hence the interaction part remain invariant under hopping .",
    "explicitly , one writes the hamiltonian in the form @xmath116 and defines the hopping term for the new particles @xmath117 the requirement that @xmath118 is invariant under hopping is obeyed provided it is a constant of motion , i.e. , @xmath119=0 $ ] .",
    "this condition fixes the transformation @xmath115 , which may be calculated order by order in a systematic expansion @xmath120 in powers of @xmath121 . by expanding the exponential and substituting the expansion of the operator @xmath115",

    "in the following , we show that within a reduced description of the sf to mi transition at fixed density in terms of a quantum rotor model  @xcite , exact results for the parity order parameter can be obtained from analyzing a @xmath133-dimensional classical lattice model .",
