    "nonlinear regression models are widely used for modeling dependencies between response and explanatory variables [ see @xcite or @xcite ] . it is well known that an appropriate choice of an experimental design can improve the quality of statistical analysis substantially , and therefore the problem of constructing optimal designs for nonlinear regression models has found considerable attention in the literature .",
    "most authors concentrate on locally optimal designs which assume that a guess for the unknown parameters of the model is available [ see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . these designs are usually used as benchmarks for commonly used designs .",
    "additionally , they serve as a basis for constructing optimal designs with respect to more sophisticated optimality criteria which address for a less precise knowledge about the unknown parameters [ see @xcite or @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the numerical or analytical calculation of optimal designs simplifies substantially if it is known that the optimal design is saturated , which means that the number of different experimental conditions coincides with the number of parameters in the model [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite among many others ] .",
    "so , the ideal situation appears if the optimal design is in the sub - class of all saturated designs . in a celebrated paper",
    ", @xcite proved that for a @xmath2th - degree polynomial regression model , any optimal design can be based on at most @xmath1 points .",
    "@xcite considered a nonlinear regression model and introduced the terminology of the de la garza phenomenon , which means that for any design there exists a saturated design , such that the information matrix of the saturated design is not inferior to that of the given design under the loewner ordering . in a remarkable paper , @xcite derived sufficient conditions on the nonlinear regression model for the occurrence of the de la garza phenomenon and demonstrated that this situation appears in a broad class of nonlinear regression models .",
    "these results generalize recent findings of @xcite for nonlinear models with two parameters .",
    "however , some care is necessary if these results are applied as indicated in the following simple example of homoscedastic linear regression on the interval @xmath3 $ ] . here",
    "the information matrix of the design which advises the experimenter to take all @xmath4 observations at the point 0 is given by @xmath5 while any other design ( using the experimental conditions @xmath6 ) yields an information matrix @xmath7 it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath8 is indefinite ( i.e. , it has positive and negative eigenvalues ) whenever one of the @xmath9 is positive .",
    "consequently , the design corresponding to @xmath10 can not be improved . on the other hand , it is also easy to see that for any @xmath11 the information matrix of the design , which takes observations at @xmath12 and at @xmath13 can be improved ( with respect to the loewner ordering ) by the information matrix corresponding to the design @xmath14 and . thus , there exist designs where a `` real '' improvement is possible , while other designs can not be improved .",
    "note that the results in @xcite do not provide a classification of the two types of designs .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to present a more detailed view point on these problems , which clarifies this  on a first glance  contradiction .",
    "in contrast to the method used by @xcite , which is mainly algebraic , our approach is analytic and based on the theory of chebyshev systems and moment spaces [ see @xcite ] .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate that the de la garza phenomenon appears in any nonlinear regression model , where the functions in the fisher information matrix form a chebyshev system .",
    "additionally , we will solve the problem described in the previous paragraph and we will identify the sufficient conditions stated in @xcite as a special case of an extended chebyshev system .",
    "therefore , our results generalize the recent findings of @xcite in a nontrivial way and , additionally , provide  in our opinion  a more transparent and more complete explanation of the de la garza phenomenon for optimal designs in nonlinear regression models .    the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] provides a brief introduction in the problem , while section [ sec3 ] contains our main results .",
    "finally , the new results are illustrated in a rational regression model , where the currently available methodology can not be used to establish the de la garza phenomenon .",
    "consider the common nonlinear regression model @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vector of unknown parameters , and different observations are assumed to be independent .",
    "the errors are normally distributed with mean @xmath17 and variance @xmath18 .",
    "the variable @xmath19 denotes the explanatory variable , which varies in the design space @xmath20 \\subset\\mathbb{r}$ ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 is a continuous and real valued function of both arguments @xmath22 \\times\\theta$ ] and differentiable with respect to the variable @xmath23 .",
    "a design is defined as a  probability measure @xmath24 on the interval @xmath20 $ ] with finite support [ see @xcite ] .",
    "if the design @xmath24 has masses @xmath25 at the points @xmath9 @xmath26 and @xmath4 observations can be made by the experimenter , this means that the quantities @xmath27 are rounded to integers , say @xmath28 , satisfying @xmath29 , and the experimenter takes @xmath28 observations at each location @xmath9 @xmath30 .",
    "the information matrix of an approximate design @xmath24 is defined by @xmath31 and it is well known [ see @xcite ] that under appropriate assumptions of regularity the covariance matrix of the least squares estimator is approximately given by @xmath32 , where @xmath4 denotes the total sample size and we assume that the observations are taken according to the approximate design @xmath24 .",
    "an optimal design maximizes an appropriate functional of the information matrix and numerous criteria have been proposed in the literature to discriminate between competing designs [ see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite among others ] . note that in nonlinear regression models the information matrix ( and as a consequence the corresponding optimal designs ) depend on the unknown parameters and are therefore called locally optimal designs [ see @xcite ] .",
    "these designs require an initial guess of the unknown parameters in the model and are used as benchmarks for many commonly used designs .",
    "most of the available optimality criteria satisfy a monotonicity property with respect to the loewner ordering , that is @xmath33 where the parameter @xmath34 is fixed , @xmath35 are two competing designs and @xmath36 denotes an information function in the sense of @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "it is of interest to derive a complete class theorem in this general context which characterizes the class of designs , which can not be improved with respect to the loewner ordering of their information matrices .",
    "we call a design @xmath37 admissible if there does not exist a design @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 as pointed out in @xcite for many nonlinear regression models the information matrix defined in ( [ 1.1a ] ) has a representation of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a nonsingular @xmath43 matrix , which does not depend on the design  @xmath24 , the matrix @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 are functions defined on the interval @xmath20 $ ] . note that these functions usually depend on the parameter @xmath34 , but for the sake of simplicity we do not reflect this dependence in our notation .",
    "obviously the inequality ( [ adm ] ) is satisfied if and only if the inequality @xmath47 is satisfied .",
    "in the following discussion , we make extensive use of the property that a system of functions has the chebyshev property . following @xcite , a set of @xmath48 continuous functions @xmath49 \\to \\mathbb{r }",
    "$ ] is called a chebyshev system ( on the interval @xmath50 $ ] ) if the inequality @xmath51 holds for all @xmath52 .",
    "note that if the determinant in  ( [ 3.11 ] ) does not vanish then either the functions @xmath53 or the functions @xmath54 form a chebyshev system .",
    "the chebyshev property has widely been used to determine explicitly @xmath55-optimal designs [ see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite among many others ] . on the other hand ,",
    "its application to other optimality criteria has not been studied intensively . in the following discussion",
    ", we will demonstrate that this property will essentially be the reason for the occurrence of the de la garza phenomenon .",
    "in particular , we will show that it is essentially sufficient to obtain a complete class theorem for the design problems associated with the nonlinear regression model  ( [ 1.1 ] ) .    for this purpose ,",
