    "we first introduce the limiting case of an _ ideal competition _ , which provides a useful tool by which to identify and quantify interesting deviations within real data , and to generate hypotheses as to what underlying processes might produce them . although we describe this model in terms of two teams accumulating points , it can in principle be generalized to other forms of competition .    in an ideal competition , events unfold on a perfectly neutral or `` level '' playing field , in which there are no environmental features that could give one side a competitive advantage over the other  @xcite . furthermore , each side is perfectly skilled , i.e. , they possess complete information both about the state of the game , e.g. , the position of the ball , the location of the players , etc .  and the set of possible strategies , their optimum responses , and their likelihood of being employed .",
    "this is an unrealistic assumption , as real competitors are imperfectly skilled , and possess both imperfect information and incomplete strategic knowledge of the game .",
    "however , increased skill generally implies improved performance on these characteristics , and the limiting case would be perfect skill .",
    "finally , each side exhibits a slightly imperfect ability to execute any particular chosen strategy , which captures the fact that no side can control all variables on the field .",
    "in other words , two perfectly skilled teams competing on a level playing field will produce scoring events by chance alone , e.g. , a slight miscalculation of velocity , a fumbled pass , shifting environmental variables like wind or heat , etc ."

    "<S> despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamics within professional sports games , relative little is known about what patterns or principles , if any , cut across different sports . using a comprehensive data set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and professional ( american ) football , professional hockey , and professional basketball , </S>",
    "<S> we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics . across these sports , scoring tempo  when scoring events occur  closely follows a common poisson process , with a sport - specific rate . similarly , scoring balance  </S>",
    "<S> how often a team wins an event  follows a common bernoulli process , with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead . combining these processes within a generative model of gameplay , we find they both reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying within - game scoring dynamics across professional team sports , and suggest specific mechanisms for driving them . </S>",
    "<S> we close with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports dynamics .    professional team sports like american football , soccer , hockey , basketball , etc .  </S>",
    "<S> provide a rich and relatively well - controlled domain by which to study fundamental questions about the dynamics of competition . in these sports , </S>",
    "<S> most environmental irregularities are eliminated , players are highly trained , and rules are enforced consistently . </S>",
    "<S> these features produce a level playing field on which competition outcomes are determined largely by a combination of skill and luck ( ideally more the former than the latter ) .    </S>",
    "<S> modern sports in particular produce large quantities of detailed data describing not only competition outcomes and team characteristics , but also the individual events within a competition , e.g. , scoring events , referee calls , timeouts , ball possessions , court positions , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of such data has enabled many quantitative analyses of individual sports  @xcite . relatively little work , however , has asked what patterns or principles , if any , cut across different sports , or whether there are fundamental processes governing some dynamical aspects of all such competitions . </S>",
    "<S> these questions are the focus of this study , and our results shed light on several other phenomena , including the roles of skill and luck in determining outcomes , and the extent to which events early in the game influence events later in the game .    </S>",
    "<S> game theory provides an attractive quantitative framework for understanding the principles and dynamics of competition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given a set of payoffs for different actions , formal game theory can identify the optimal strategy or probability distribution over actions against an intelligent adversary . in simple decision spaces , like penalty shots in soccer  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite or serve - and - return play in tennis  @xcite , professional athletes appear to behave as game theory predicts ( although some do not  @xcite ) . however , most professional team sports exhibit large and complex decision spaces , with many possible actions of uncertain payoffs , and execution is carried out by an imperfectly coordinated team . </S>",
    "<S> game theory provides less guidance within such complex games , and the resulting dynamics are often better described using tools from dynamical systems  @xcite .    using such an approach </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the within - game scoring dynamics of four team sports , college and professional ( american ) football , professional hockey , and professional basketball . </S>",
    "<S> our primary goals are ( i ) to quantify and identify the common empirical patterns in scoring dynamics of these sports , and ( ii ) to understand the competitive processes that produce these patterns . we do not consider non - stationary effects across games , e.g. , evolving team rosters or skill sets , playing field variables , etc . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we focus explicitly on the sequence of scoring events within games . for each sport , we study three measurable quantities : scoring event tempo , balance , and predictability . </S>",
    "<S> we take an inferential approach to investigating their cross - sport patterns and present a generative model of competition dynamics that can be fitted directly to scoring event data within games . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this model to a comprehensive data set of 1,279,901 scoring events across 9 or 10 years of consecutive seasons in our four team sports .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many claims in both the academic literature and the popular press about scoring dynamics within sports , and sports are often used as exemplars of decision making and dynamics in complex competitive environments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results on common patterns in scoring dynamics and the processes that generate them serve to clarify , and in several cases directly contradict , many of these claims , and provide a systematic perspective on the general phenomenon . +    [ [ summary - of - results . ] ] summary of results . </S>",
    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    across all sports , scoring tempo  when scoring events occur  is remarkably well - described by a poisson process , in which scoring events occur independently with a sport - specific rate at each second on the game clock . </S>",
    "<S> this rate is fairly stable across the course of gameplay , except in the first and last few seconds of a scoring period , where it is much lower or much higher , respectively , than normal . </S>",
    "<S> this common pattern implies that scoring events are largely memoryless , i.e. , the timing of events earlier in the game have little or no impact on the timing of future events . </S>",
    "<S> memorylessness contrasts with the dynamics of strategic games like chess or go , in which events early in a game constrain and drive later events . instead </S>",
    "<S> , professional sports appear to exhibit little strategic entailment , and events are driven instead by short - term optimization for scoring as quickly as possible .    the scoring balance between teams  </S>",
    "<S> how often a team wins a scoring event  is well - described by a common bernoulli process , with a bias parameter that varies effectively over gameplay and across sports . </S>",
    "<S> football and hockey exhibit a common pattern in which the probability of scoring again while in the lead effectively increases with lead size . in basketball , however , this probability decreases with lead size ( a phenomenon first identified by  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former pattern is consistent with the outcome of each scoring event being determined by a memoryless coin flip whose bias depends on the difference in the teams inherent skill levels . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern in basketball is also consistent with such a process , but where on - court team skill varies inversely with lead size as a result of teams deploying their weaker players when they are in the lead and their stronger players when they are not . </S>",
    "<S> this player management strategy produces substantially more unpredictable games than in other sports , with winning teams losing their lead and losing teams regaining it much more often than we would normally expect .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , these results reinforce the conclusions from scoring tempo , indicating that event outcomes early in a game have little or no impact on event outcomes later in the game , which reinforces statistical claims that teams do not become `` hot , ''  @xcite with successes running in streaks . </S>",
    "<S> instead , gameplay is largely a sequence of roughly independent , short - term optimizations aimed at maximizing near - term scoring rates , with little multi - play strategic efforts and few downstream consequences for mistakes or miscalculations . </S>",
    "<S> this memorylessness may be caused by a persistently level playing field , which lacks strategically exploitable environmental features  @xcite and forbids actions that might produce sustained competitive advantages  @xcite as a result of within - game choices , e.g. , eliminating an opposing team s best players . </S>",
    "<S> table  [ table : q : and : a ] summarizes these results as they relate to a series of specific questions about scoring dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> we combine these insights within a generative model of gameplay and demonstrate that it accurately reproduces the observed evolution of lead - sizes over the course of games in all four sports , and also makes highly accurate predictions of game outcomes , when only the first few scoring events have occurred . </S>",
    "<S> cursory comparisons suggest that this model achieves accuracy comparable to or better than several commercial odds - makers , despite this model knowing nothing about teams , players , or strategies , and instead relying exclusively on the observed tempo and balance patterns in scoring events . </S>"
