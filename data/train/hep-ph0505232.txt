    "precision tests of the standard model in the @xmath0 sector have been one of the main issues of the lep2 physics program . in this context",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0 mass is one of the most interesting tests . due to the high precision which is experimentally achievable , about 0.05% in the lep combination",
    ", it is important to have a robust estimate of all the possible systematic uncertainties .",
    "electroweak radiative corrections on @xmath3 events , which are used for the @xmath0 mass and width measurements , and more generally on 4-@xmath1 events , have been an important issue since lep2 beginning . after the lep2 workshop of 1995",
    "@xcite it has been clear that the simple radiative corrections approach based on the improved born approximation ( iba ) is not sufficient to obtain a theoretical precision smaller than the experimental foreseen one in precise @xmath0 physics measurements .    at the 2000",
    "lep2 monte carlo workshop  @xcite calculations implementing full @xmath2 electroweak radiative corrections for 4-@xmath1 events in the so called double pole approximation ( dpa )  @xcite , i.e. reliable around the double resonant @xmath0 pole , have been available as the result of an effort from the theory community .",
    "there are two monte carlo generators implementing these calculations , yfsww  @xcite and racoonww  @xcite .",
    "initially the studies on the theoretical precision of these calculations have been devoted to the inclusive @xmath3 cross section , showing a satisfactory 0.4% agreement between the two codes .",
    "studies of differential distributions at generator level have been shown by both the theoretical groups and by others ( for instance  @xcite ) , but a full attempt of assessing the theoretical precision on @xmath0 related observables has been presented only later for the @xmath0 mass  @xcite and for the tgc  @xcite .    in the tgc related study",
    "the possible sources of uncertainties in both generators are considered and the calculations compared one to the other . moreover a detector effect parameterization ( based on the aleph simulation and analysis ) is used to mimic the dominant effects beyond the pure electroweak generator .",
    "the @xmath0 mass study is a pure 4-@xmath4 generator one based on a pseudo - observable ( the @xmath5 mass with some photon recombination ) not directly comparable with the real observable measured by the experiments .",
    "it is based on an internal precision study of yfsww plus a comparison with racoonww .",
    "these studies provide a complete discussion of all the basic ingredients of the systematic uncertainty related to electroweak corrections , but the authors themselves recognize that for the @xmath0 mass a study at full analysis level is needed for a complete final determination to be used by lep experiments .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to use the above mentioned studies as a guideline to perform a complete estimation of this systematic uncertainty for the @xmath0 mass analysis in the frame of the full delphi event and detector simulation , reconstruction and analysis chain .    in section  [ sec : delphi4f ] the study of the intrinsic uncertainty of the delphi 4-@xmath1 generator  @xcite , based on yfsww as far as radiative corrections are concerned ,",
    "is discussed . in section  [ sec : racoonww ] the comparison with racoonww is presented .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows the global results and conclusions on the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath0 mass and width .",
    "although the target of the present study is the assessment of the uncertainty on the @xmath0 mass , the techniques and the monte carlo samples presented can be used for similar studies on other observables , in particular the tgc .",
    "the 4-@xmath1 generator used for this study is the standard delphi one , based on wphact  @xcite with the yfs - exponentiated isr from koralw  @xcite and with additional radiative corrections implemented for @xmath3 like events through yfsww , using a reweighting technique as in the kandy `` monte carlo tandem ''  @xcite : iba based events are reweighted in order to reproduce with good approximation the result of the dpa calculation . for simplicity it will be referred to as wandy . for single @xmath0 events and non @xmath3-like final states an iba approach",
    "is adopted , using the qedps parton shower generator  @xcite in order to describe isr , suitably adapted in the energy scale used for the radiation .",
    "the version used for this study , as well as for the final delphi @xmath0 mass analysis ( internal delphi version 2.4 ) differs from  @xcite in the treatment of the final state radiation ( fsr ) from leptons , which is implemented with photos  @xcite : photos version 2.5 is used , implementing non leading logarithm ( nll ) corrections which bring it quite close to the full matrix element calculation  @xcite .",
    "the study has been performed at the centre of mass energy of @xmath6 gev , corresponding to the 1998 data sample .",
    "it has been chosen since it represents the highest single - energy data statistics available .",
    "the wide range of sources of systematic uncertainties and possible studies discussed in  @xcite implies the need for several distinct monte carlo samples .",
    "several sources can in fact be studied by simple event reweighting , applying as event weight the ratio of the modified matrix element squared and the standard one , where the modifications are related to the uncertainty source to be studied .",
    "all the possible weights have been implemented in the production of the standard @xmath3-like 4-@xmath1 samples .",
    "some studies can not be performed by event reweighting and require dedicated samples . in the standard",
    "wandy the leading pole approximation ( lpa ) expansion around the double resonant pole is made using the approach that in yfsww is called the @xmath7 scheme  @xcite ; the other available approach , the so called @xmath8 scheme  @xcite , must be generated directly with yfsww .",
    "another case is the possible change of order in leptonic fsr : this would require distinct samples with @xmath2 and @xmath9@xmath10 matrix elements .",
    "furthermore the need to compare wandy to racoonww , which has some remarkable differences with respect to the normal delphi code , has suggested to produce a dedicated wandy sample suitably modified to be as close as possible to racoonww itself .",
    "since racoonww can not produce directly samples with several final states at the same time , and the statistical precision needed for a meaningful comparison ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) requires about 1 million events per channel to be produced , two final states have been chosen as representatives of the fully hadronic and semileptonic channels for these special event samples .    in order to minimize as much as possible 4-@xmath1 background contamination to cc03 diagrams , cc11 final states have been selected ; the 4-@xmath1 background effect is better studied in the standard wandy sample , with massive kinematics and dedicated radiative corrections not present in racoonww and where inter - channel migration effects , in which the 4-@xmath1 background can also play a role , can be studied . for the fully hadronic channel the @xmath13 final state has been chosen , and for the semileptonic channel @xmath14 has been preferred due to the presumably higher sensitivity to fsr corrections : photons are likely to be seen , while in final states with electrons most of them are merged in the calorimetric shower of the electron itself , and in taus they are generally merged in the jet of particles coming from the decay , which play a dominant role making all the studies more complex .    in order to be directly comparable with racoonww , these dedicated samples have been produced with the following modifications ( compared to the standard settings ) :    * diagonal ckm matrix ; * fixed @xmath0 and @xmath15 widths ; * @xmath2 final state radiation from leptons with photos version 2.5 .",
    "it is closer to racoonww than the original version in the lack of higher orders fsr ; * no coulomb correction , khoze - chapovsky ansatz coulomb correction  @xcite implemented through reweighting .",
    "since in the normal production the standard coulomb correction is already included , the reweighting would allow to study only the difference between this one and the approximated version of the full non - factorizable @xmath2 correction , the so called coulomb correction in the khoze - chapovsky ansatz .",
    "in order to study the net @xmath2 correction effect with respect to the tree level ( known to be significantly smaller than the previously mentioned difference ) , no coulomb correction is implemented in the special samples generation .",
    "the main concern of possible systematic differences in the results from the dedicated samples and the standard ones is linked to the propagators width treatment .",
    "a test has been performed with a small ( 100k events ) dedicated @xmath14 sample produced with the above modification but the @xmath0 and @xmath15 width , kept running .",
    "the @xmath0 mass difference with respect to the main @xmath14 sample was : @xmath16 well compatible with the known simple shift of @xmath17 mev of the mass value when moving from the fixed to the running width definition  @xcite .",
    "this known shift has been verified at generator level with a precision of about 2 mev .",
    "the wandy code has been extensively compared to yfsww ( see  @xcite ) , and for cc03 events it has been shown to be equivalent to kandy . anyway , as a further consistency cross check , in order to allow the generalization of the results of this study , a dedicated yfsww @xmath13 sample using @xmath7 scheme has been produced at pure `` 4-@xmath18 '' level ( including fsr from quarks ) to compare with a similar wandy sample and with racoonww at a corresponding level . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app1 ] the input parameters set for yfsww , equivalent to what used in wandy , is given .    in the cross check",
    "only the cc03 part of wandy has been used to be consistent with yfsww .",
    "the total cross sections are found to be in agreement at the ( @xmath19 level . in the event analysis photons forming an angle with the beam axis smaller than 2 degrees are discarded , and those with a bigger angle are recombined with the charged fermion with which they form the smallest invariant mass if their energy is below 300 mev or if this mass is below 5 gev .",
    "several observables have been checked , among which the most interesting ones for this study are invariant mass distributions .",
    "they have been fitted using a fixed width like breit - wigner function : @xmath20 where the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the ( shifted ) @xmath0 mass and width ( @xmath21 actually represents the shift of the @xmath0 mass with respect to 80.4 gev / c@xmath23 ) .",
    "the absolute value obtained in the fit depends on the fit function form and it is not particularly relevant .",
    "what matters for this check is the level of agreement between different codes when using the same analysis and fit procedure .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the result of the fits on the average of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 invariant masses .",
    "the agreement both in the mass and in the width is satisfactory .",
    "an approach closer to the real analysis is to look at the average of the masses from the pairing in which the difference of the di - fermion masses is smallest ( a criterion inspired by the equal masses constraint used in constrained fits ) ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and also here the agreement is good .",
    "an observable that is very interesting , as will be seen in the comparison with racoonww , is the invariant mass rescaled by the ratio of the beam energy and di - fermion energy : it is the simplest way to mimic at pure generator level the energy - momentum conservation which is usually imposed in constrained fits and which is responsible for the sensitivity of the results to photon radiation , isr in particular .",
    "differences in the radiation structure are likely to cause visible effects in this kind of mass distributions , even if the previous ones are in good agreement . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the average of the invariant masses computed as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] but rescaled by the ratio @xmath26 is shown : also in this case , despite the sizeable effect of the rescaling on the fitted parameters compared to the previous fits , the agreement is very satisfactory .",
    "this check proves that the results based on wandy can be considered valid for similar analysis using yfsww ( possibly except for specific non cc03 diagrams related features ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath0 mass and width measurement due to the electroweak radiative corrections is the effect of the approximations and of the missing terms in the theoretical calculation used for the analysis .",
    "its exact knowledge would imply the full computation of the missing corrections .",
    "the evaluation of the systematic uncertainty means estimating the order of magnitude of the effect of these not yet computed terms on the analysis .",
    "this goal is practically achieved by splitting the calculations in different parts ( isr , fsr , etc . )",
    ", whose limited knowledge introduces a source of uncertainty in the electroweak radiative corrections as implemented in wandy .",
    "the size of the uncertainty from each of these sources can be estimated by repeating the full @xmath0 mass ( and width ) analysis with changes in the part of the radiative corrections related to this source , whose effect should reasonably be of the same order of magnitude ( or bigger ) than the missing terms , and comparing with the standard calculation .",
    "this study can be performed on both the dedicated high statistics samples and on the standard ones .",
    "the purely numerical precision from the fit algorithm is 0.1 mev for the mass value and 0.3 mev for the mass error . on the width , due to the very slow variation of the likelihood curve around the minimum ,",
    "the numerical accuracy on the fit result is about 1 mev .    as already mentioned in the previous section , for several sources of uncertainty it is possible to use a reweighting technique , which allows to reuse the same event sample for several studies , minimizing the simulation needed .",
    "when using the reweighting technique , the statistical error on the difference between the results of the fits on the standard and the modified sample has to take into account the correlation existing between the samples : the same events are used , simply with a different weight in the fit .",
    "this correlation allows to strongly reduce the error on the difference itself , with respect to comparisons of statistically uncorrelated samples .    in order to take into account the correlation the total sample for one channel has been divided into several subsamples , and",
    "the difference has been computed for each subsample .",
    "the rms of the subsamples differences distribution , divided by the square root of the number of subsamples , is an estimate of the uncertainty which naturally includes the correlation between the original and reweighted samples .",
    "this way of computing the errors has been cross checked for the mass ( where numerical fluctuations are generally negligible compared to the statistical ones ) with the `` jackknife ''  @xcite one , subtracting each time one subsample , and a very good agreement in the error estimate has been found .",
    "the study has been performed only on 4-@xmath1 @xmath3-like events , omitting all the remaining background processes .",
    "the rate and nature of the total selected events which are discarded in this way strongly depends on the channel  @xcite :    : @xmath27 5%    : @xmath28 1%    : @xmath27 9%    : @xmath27 24%    for semileptonic events they are both @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the relative rate depending on the channel , while for fully hadronic events practically only the latter class of events weighs and is not considered .",
    "other processes give anyway a negligible contribution . the uncertainty from the radiative corrections on these events",
    "is taken into account in the uncertainty on the background .      following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , several distinct categories of uncertainty sources common to all @xmath3 channels can be identified , corresponding to different parts of the electroweak corrections :    * @xmath3 production : initial state radiation ( isr ) ; * @xmath0 decay : final state radiation ( fsr ) ; * non - factorizable qed interference ( nf ) @xmath2 corrections ; * ambiguities in lpa definition : non leading factorizable ( nl ) @xmath2 corrections .",
    "moreover , due to the importance of the single @xmath0 diagrams in the semileptonic electron channel and the relatively sizeable uncertainty on the radiative corrections on them , a dedicated study has been performed for semileptonic channels .",
    "the uncertainty for each of the categories is studied by testing the effect of activating / deactivating or modifying the relative corrections , in order to have an estimate of the potential effect of used approximations and non - calculated missing terms .",
    "table  [ tab : specmw ] and  [ tab : specgw ] show the results of the studies for @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively on the dedicated samples , while table  [ tab : stdmw ] and  [ tab : stdgw ] show the results on the standard samples",

    "the comparison is done with the standard coulomb correction , part of the traditional iba setup used before dpa .",
    "the effect of using the kc ansatz with respect to born can be considered as an upper limit of the missing part of the full @xmath2 calculation and of the higher order terms .",
    "since the effect on the @xmath0 mass and width in comparing with the standard coulomb correction on all the final states is approximately the same for all the channels , the values found on the special samples are used for all the final states without further studies .",
    "the effect of the nl factorizable @xmath2 corrections in lpa is shown in all the tables .",
    "as it is seen , its almost complete compensation with the change from standard coulomb to kc coulomb correction is the reason for the small net effect of the full dpa correction on the @xmath0 mass in comparison to the iba . for the @xmath0 width on the contrary the effects are in the same sense and add up .",
    "two sources of uncertainties are considered , following the study in  @xcite .",
    "missing higher orders effect can be , at least partly , evaluated by changing the electroweak scheme used in the @xmath2 calculation .",
    "the standard one in yfsww and wandy , conventionally called a , corresponds to the @xmath106 scheme , the other available one is called b , and it corresponds to the choice of racoonww .",
    "this essentially means changing the definition of the qed fine structure constant used in the @xmath2 matrix element ( see for instance the explanation in  @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is very small , at the limit of the fit sensitivity , both for the mass and the width .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice here that in yfsww and wandy the @xmath2 implementation beyond the standard iba can be technically splitted in two stages , the first one involving the introduction of the wsr and isr - wsr interference in the yfs form factor and infrared @xmath107 factors , and the second one where the electroweak virtual and soft @xmath2 corrections and the hard @xmath2 matrix element are used to replace the pure qed ll calculation . in this context",
    "it is interesting to notice that the effect on the @xmath0 mass of the second phase is quite small when compared to the total effect of the lpa correction , at most @xmath9@xmath108 of it .",
    "this allows to conclude that the introduction of the isr - wsr interference in the yfs form factor and infrared @xmath107 factors plays a key role . for the @xmath0 width on the contrary the effect of the second part",
    "is found to be much more important .",
    "the second , more relevant , source of uncertainty connected to the lpa is its possible definition , i.e. the ambiguity present in the way of expanding the amplitude around the double resonant @xmath0 pole .",
    "the standard yfsww and wandy use the so called @xmath7 definition ; a comparison with the @xmath8 one can give an estimate of the effect from the instrinsic ambiguity in the lpa definition .",
    "unfortunately @xmath8 can not be reproduced through reweighting , and it gives sizeable changes in comparison to @xmath7 already at born ( or iba ) level . therefore in order to evaluate only the effect on the @xmath2 correction a separate @xmath8 sample has been generated with yfsww , and the effect has been estimated as the double difference : @xmath109 on the special samples . the size of the effect is within 1 mev for the mass , within 4 mev for the width , dominated by the statistical uncertainty ( statistically independent samples are used ) .",
    "this result will be used for all the final states and channels , since lpa is applied on the cc03 part of the matrix element and therefore the estimate obtained here should be approximately valid for all the final states .      at born level",
    "the full 4-@xmath1 diagrams set for @xmath3-like final states is computed with a very high precision , at least for lep2 energies and in the phase space regions relevant for the @xmath0 mass and width measurements .",
    "this was shown already by the studies in  @xcite .",
    "therefore the systematic uncertainties associated to it are linked essentially to the electroweak corrections .    the dpa is known to be valid in a few @xmath32 interval around the double resonant pole .",
    "the study of the previous section takes into account the ambiguity in its definition and the effects caused by this ambiguity far from the pole .",
    "since the so called `` additive approach '' is used in wandy for the dpa implementation through reweighting , e.g. the dpa correction is applied only to the cc03 part of the matrix element ( and partly to the interference , see  @xcite ) , non cc03 diagrams contributions are not directly affected by the dpa uncertainty ( except for possible effects in the interference term which is relevant for the electron channel ) .    it is clear that this still leaves the problem of the approximated radiative corrections treatment for the non cc03 part of the matrix element ( and the interference ) .",
    "the isr studies previously discussed can reasonably cover the most relevant part of the electroweak radiative corrections uncertainties present also for the @xmath3-like 4-@xmath1 background diagrams , e.g. the non cc03 part .",
    "there is a noticeable exception represented by the so called single @xmath0 diagrams for the @xmath59 final state ( see  @xcite for their definition and a basic discussion of the problem ) .",
    "the bulk of single @xmath0 events is rejected in the @xmath0 mass and width analysis , since the electron in these events is lost in the beam pipe .",
    "but the cc03 - single @xmath0 interference is sizeable , and it has a strong impact on the @xmath0 mass result in the electron channel .",
    "this can be easily seen from the variation of the @xmath0 mass result for the electron channel when only the cc03 part of the matrix element is used in the simulation ( inter - final state cross talk is included ) : @xmath110 and comparing with the variation when only the cc03/non cc03 interference is excluded from the simulation : @xmath111    it can be noticed that the big effect of moving from a full 4-@xmath1 calculation to the cc03 only is almost entirely due to the interference between the cc03 and the non cc03 part .    the situation is different in the @xmath0 width analysis , where in @xmath112 events reconstructed as electrons the effects of non cc03 diagrams and the cc03 - non cc03 interference are opposite in sign and almost completely canceling .",
    "the situation is made even more complex by the cross talk between channel , e.g. events belonging in reality to one channel but reconstructed as belonging to another one .",
    "this cross talk is particularly relevant between electrons and taus , and this explains why also the @xmath113 channel is sensitive to this uncertainty source .",
    "the effect is particularly relevant for the width , where variations of the non cc03 parts of the @xmath112 matrix element give different results with respect to the electron channel : the pure non cc03 diagrams give again an effect opposite in sign to the interference , but much bigger , so in the width analysis the tau channel is more sensitive to this systematic effect than the electron one : @xmath114    studying separately real @xmath115 events from the @xmath112 ones reconstructed as taus clearly shows that this behaviour is due to the cross talk .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite show that the standard iba calculations suffer from several problems for the single @xmath0 process , ranging from gauge invariance issues to the scale to be used for the isr ( the @xmath116-channel scale should be preferred to the @xmath117-channel one ) , problems which can globally lead to a @xmath9@xmath118 uncertainty on the cross section .",
    "it should be noticed that wandy implements several improvements in this sector with respect to fixed width based iba calculations ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "its use has been fundamental in assessing the dpa precision on the @xmath3 cross section , by comparing it with yfsww .",
    "it looks therefore interesting to try to use it also for a completely independent cross check of the yfsww based results on the @xmath0 mass and width ( and possibly on other @xmath0 related measurements ) .",
    "this check has been already done in  @xcite , finding a good agreement between the two codes , but as previously explained on an observable which is not directly linked to the real analysis .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : app2 ] the input options set used for racoonww in this study is shown , and the output of one of the runs is given to show the values of all the relevant parameters adopted for the tuned comparison with wandy and yfsww .",
    "the phase space slicing approach has been adopted for the implementation of the radiative corrections , in the version suggested for unweighted events production ( smc = 3 ) .",
    "the delphi version of pythia has been used for the quark hadronization .",
    "there is anyway a number of challenges in this test to be taken into account .",
    "real photon emission is handled in a completely different way with respect to yfsww .",
    "in particular real emission in the detector acceptance ( i.e. with finite @xmath58 ) is computed only at @xmath2 , although with a full 4-@xmath4 matrix element .",
    "higher order isr is present only through collinear structure functions on events where there is no hard @xmath2 emission , a very different situation compared to the yfs exponentiation for isr and wsr and the @xmath9@xmath57 ll isr matrix element .",
    "no fsr beyond the one already included in the @xmath2 is present , while in yfsww the fsr is independent from the remaining part of the @xmath2 calculation and introduced at @xmath9@xmath10 for leptons through photos and , merged with gluon emission , in the parton shower for quarks .",
    "these differences have been investigated in the literature ( see for instance  @xcite ) and are known to give sizeable discrepancies in the photon related observables .",
    "therefore it is difficult to disentangle differences arising from a different way of computing the same corrections from those due to the use of different sets of corrections .",
    "since it is known that racoonww in its dpa mode does not compare well with yfsww on photonic spectra , the racoonww authors have developed a 4-@xmath4 iba mode which combines the @xmath2 matrix element and collinear structure functions .",
    "the photonic energy and angular spectra produced in this mode are in much better agreement with the yfsww ones at lep2 energies , but it is not possible at present to combine it with the dpa corrections for the virtual and soft emission part in a consistent way .    moreover the energy and angle cutoffs for the soft / hard photon emission separation in racoonww are in practice quite higher than the yfsww ones , due to the quite different techniques adopted in the two calculations . the phase space slicing approach for matching virtual",
    ", soft and hard corrections has been used for this test , and these cutoffs are an integral part of the approach itself .",
    "the values used , shown in appendix  [ sec : app2 ] , correspond roughly to a minimum real photon energy of about 95 mev and a minimum real photon - fermion angle of about 1.8 degrees , and are a compromise between the reliability of the calculation and the attempt to avoid merging with fermions photons which could be detected separately by the detector .",
    "moreover , in contrast to what has been suggested by the authors , to avoid results which are dependent on the specific cutoff chosen , no further photon recombination is applied in the sample production .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that in a realistic simulation of a detector any recombination has to be determined by the detector granularity and analysis procedure itself , and due to the already big values of the cutoffs adopted , any further recombination would risk to suppress photons that would be detectable .    for final states with quarks , where the hadronization phase has to be described beyond the electroweak radiative corrections ,",
    "the use of a full 4-@xmath4 matrix element , in principle more correct than a parton shower , creates in practice a problem : photons are systematically emitted before gluons , which is unphysical and most probably incompatible with the hadronization packages tunings used ( pythia  @xcite is the standard choice for the analysis and this study ) .",
    "the suggestion of the authors of racoonww to switch off the photon radiation in the parton shower to compensate for the photon emission in the matrix element has been adopted in this study , but it does not seem a real solution to the problem , and of course it can potentially spoil the validity of the hadronization tuning used . in case of need this problem might be studied with the wandy setup , trying to emulate the racoonww situation , i.e. calling photos also for quark pairs before the call to pythia , and switching off photon emission inside pythia itself .",
    "this presumably would overestimate the effect of fsr , since the photon emission would be performed independently from the two fermion pairs .    a third potential problem in the comparison is represented by racoonww generating massless fermions in the final state .",
    "fermion masses are added _ a posteriori _ using the routine provided by the authors , which conserves obviously the total 4-momentum and the di - fermion masses .",
    "it is clear that when a sizeable mass , compared to the fermion energy , is added , as in the case of the @xmath130 quark pair , this could lead to distortions in the final state distributions .",
    "all these features suggest that the comparison results must be considered with care , if serious discrepancies are found ( as it is the case ) . on the other hand",
    "no special tuning has been prepared for the hadronization package , in order to avoid mixing problems concerning different sectors of the event description .",
    "table  [ tab : racoonww ] shows the result of the comparison between wandy and racoonww 1.3 .",
    "a sizeable discrepancy can be seen for the mass in the @xmath14 channel , and , to a minor extent , for the width in the @xmath13 channel .      + - racoonww 1.3 & @xmath131 & @xmath132 +   + - racoonww 1.3 & @xmath133 & @xmath134 +    extensive studies have been performed in order to investigate the discrepancies , in particular the one on the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the different hadronization due to the treatment of fsr from quarks in racoonww has of course an influence on the jet characteristics , and can affect the results , in particular the ones for the width .",
    "optimizing the interface of the hadronization with the electroweak full matrix element to circumvent possible problems arising from the simple minded approach followed goes beyond the scope of this study .    a generator level analysis analogous to the one whose results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] , has been used for a 4-@xmath4 level comparison of wandy with racoonww 1.3 for the @xmath14 channel ( all the 4-@xmath1 diagrams are included here , not only the cc03 part ) .",
    "this study has been used to investigate the discrepancy on the @xmath0 mass trying to disentangle the genuine electroweak part from possible problems connected to the implementation of the hadronization phase .",
    "this study has clearly shown the crucial role played by the photon clustering , in particular around the muon .",
    "the different treatment of the soft , but mainly of the collinear photons in the two codes implies a strong difference in the radiation around the fermions .",
    "in racoonww no visible photon is generated in a cone of 1.8 degrees around a fermion , no matter which energy it has , and the radiation is reassociated to the lepton .",
    "this is not true in wandy , were the energy and angle cutoffs ( for fsr from leptons the photos ones ) are quite smaller , closer to a real situation .    for quarks",
    "this is not a big problem since experimentally fsr photons can not be disentangled from jets , and they are naturally clustered to the jets themselves .",
    "but the treatment of photons around leptons is a different problem .",
    "while in the reconstruction of high energy electrons a clustering of photons is done in order to take into account the bremsstrahlung due to the interaction with the detector , muons can be quite cleanly separated from photons , unless they are strictly collinear . in the latter case the photon energy",
    "is anyway lost , since the muon momentum is used , not the energy deposited in the calorimeters possibly associated to it .",
    "@xmath14 is therefore a good final state to study in detail differences in the visible photon radiation , mainly fsr .    in the real analysis",
    "visible photons , which have passed the quality selection criteria , are clustered to the muon if in a cone of 3 degrees around it , otherwise are associated to the jets .",
    "this procedure can partly reabsorb the difference in the collinear radiation mentioned above , even if not completely , because of limited photon reconstruction efficiency , resolution , selection cutoffs , etc .",
    "the effect of this photon clustering is of improving the agreement between the two calculations on the fitted mass , without it the difference in table  [ tab : racoonww ] would be about -50 mev .    the @xmath0 mass difference obtained on the beam energy rescaled average mass ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) is -6 mev if photons are clustered to the charged fermion with which they have the smallest @xmath58 .",
    "if on the contrary the clustering to the muon is done only for photons in a 3 degrees cone around it , associating all the others to the quarks , the difference becomes -23 mev .",
    "increasing the opening angle of the cone for the clustering improves the agreement , but of course in the real analysis such a procedure would rapidly cluster photons coming from the hadronization of the quarks ( mainly @xmath135 decay products ) . although the opening angle might be tuned to minimize the rate of photons from jets clustered and optimize the wandy - racoonww agreement , such a procedure would introduce further systematic uncertainties due to the imperfect knowledge of the photon distributions in jets .    the residual discrepancy is presumably linked to the known differences between the two calculations in the description of the radiation beyond the treatment of the strictly collinear region in this study .",
    "the good agreement for the mass found in the hadronic channel seems due to the smaller sensitivity of the analysis to the detailed description of the photonic radiation , since the photon clustering is implicit in the analysis procedure itself .",
    "this looks anyway an encouraging result for the general confidence in the study .",
    "in this situation using the difference between the prediction of the two calculations to estimate the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath0 mass and width does not seem appropriate .",
    "the results of all the studies presented have to be combined in a single uncertainty for each channel . tables  [ tab : deltamw ] and  [ tab : deltagw ] present an estimate of the different sources of uncertainties as it can be deduced from the studies presented in the section  [ sec : delphisetup ] .",
    "where the numerical or statistical uncertainty on the estimate is comparable with the estimate itself , they are added linearly to take them conservatively into account .",
