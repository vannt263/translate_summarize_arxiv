    "strongly correlated materials exhibit a variety of phases whose properties often lack a complete microscopic understanding.@xcite the most interesting new aspect of this class of materials is a possibility to tune the system through two or more different ground states separated by quantum critical points ( qcps).@xcite such qcps are often difficult to directly approach and investigate , not only because they reside at @xmath0 , but also because various additional instabilities and orders emerge in their immediate vicinity .",
    "nevertheless , understanding them is of chief importance , because they often control rather extended finite temperature quantum critical regions displaying universal properties and featuring scaling behavior of all quantities .",
    "quantum critical points have been experimentally identified and studied in several classes of physical systems , ranging from heavy fermion metals@xcite to conventional@xcite and even high temperature superconductors.@xcite in most of these , however , the qcp is obtained when quantum fluctuations become sufficiently strong to suppress an appropriate ordering temperature - for magnetic , structural , or superconducting order - down to @xmath0 .",
    "when this happens , then concepts familiar from the very successful theory of classical critical phenomena can be utilized and naturally extended to a quantum regime.@xcite indeed , most conventional theoretical approaches follow the landau theory paradigm@xcite and examine the impact of thermal and quantum fluctuations of appropriate order parameters , as describing the corresponding patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "should most exotic phenomena , then , be regarded as manifestations of some form of ( static or fluctuating ) order , as slater speculated even in 1930s,@xcite or should fundamentally different classes of quantum phase transitions exist ?",
    "the first viewpoint was at the origin of the hertz ( weak coupling ) approach@xcite to quantum criticality , which despite its formal elegance resulted in only modest successes .",
    "the latter , however , was at the core of pioneering ideas of mott@xcite and anderson,@xcite who provided a complementary perspective . according to their views , strong electronic correlations are able destroy the metallic state even in absence of any ordering , leading to the formation of the mott insulating state .",
    "the existence of broad classes of mott insulators is , of course , beyond the doubt at this time . and",
    "while most order anti - ferromagnetically at low temperature , they indeed remain robustly insulating ( gaps often in the electron - volt range ) even well above the corresponding neel temperature.@xcite    the nature of the phase transition between the metallic and the insulating phase - the mott transition - has , in contrast , remained highly controversial and subject to much debate . because the two phases share the same symmetries , the clear distinction between them is apparent only at @xmath0 .",
    "should a direct and _ continuous _ transition between a paramagnetic metal and a paramagnetic mott insulator exist at @xmath0 , it would represent the most obvious example of a qcp outside the landau paradigm - unrelated to any mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking . unfortunately , in most familiar situations , the mott metal - insulator transition is also accompanied by simultaneous magnetic , charge , structural , or orbital ordering , considerably complicating the situation and fogging the issues , both from the theoretical and the experimental perspective .",
    "still , it is a well established experimental fact that in all known cases , the characteristic temperature scale @xmath1 , below which many of such `` intervening '' phases are found , is quite small - as compared to both basic competing energy scales : the fermi energy @xmath2 measuring the quantum fluctuations , and the coulomb repulsion @xmath3 that opposes the electron motion . as a result , a very sharp crossover between metallic and insulating behavior is observed even at @xmath4 , for all physical quantities .",
    "the key issue thus remains : what is the main physical mechanism controlling this finite temperature metal - insulator crossover ? should it be viewed as a quantum critical regime dominated by appropriate order - parameter fluctuations , or is it - as postulated by mott and anderson - a dynamical phenomenon not directly related to any ordering tendency .    to clearly and precisely address this question , one",
    "must : ( 1 ) suppress all ordering tendencies , at least in the relevant temperature range , and ( 2 ) understand and describe the remaining physical processes controlling the resulting finite temperature crossovers , and the corresponding quantum critical region , if one exists . from the theoretical point of view , this ambitious goal is generally very difficult to achieve , at least for realistic model systems .",
    "the task is hard , because standard perturbative approaches , which are so well - suited to describe fermi surface instabilities and the associated competing orders , are quite incapable in describing the mott physics .",
    "the situation , however , improved with the development of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) method,@xcite which capitalizes on performing a local approximation for appropriate self - energies and vertex functions , yet which provides a completely non - perturbative description of strong correlation effects .",
    "its physical content is most clearly revealed by focussing at the `` maximally frustrated hubbard model '' ( mfhm)@xcite with long range and frustrating inter - site hopping ( see below ) , where the dmft approximation becomes exact .",
    "the mfhm - because it is maximally frustrated - displays no magnetic or any other kind of long range order across its phase diagram . it does display , however , a precisely defined mott metal - insulator transition at low temperature , precisely in the fashion anticipated by early ideas of mott and anderson .",
    "it has been studied by many authors , ever since the beginning of the dmft era some twenty years ago@xcite ; yet surprisingly , some of its basic features have remained ill - understood and even confusing .",
    "most studies focused on characterizing the low temperature behavior , where a strongly correlated fermi liquid ( fl ) forms on the metallic side of the mott transition.@xcite at low temperatures , this fl phase is separated from the mott insulator by an intervening phase coexistence region ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the associated first - order transition line ( fotl ) terminating at the critical end - point ( cep ) at @xmath5.@xcite the behavior in the immediate vicinity of the cep has attracted much recent attention@xcite but unsurprisingly ( as any other finite - temperature cep ) , it display scaling behavior of the standard classical liquid - gas ( ising ) universality class.@xcite indeed , several experiment reporting transport in this regime have successfully been interpreted@xcite using these classical models .",
    "but what about the supercritical ( @xmath4 ) behavior ?",
    "its rough features have been investigated by many authors,@xcite who identified several regimes and complicated crossovers connected them , but no simple and plausible physical picture has emerged .",
    "most importantly , almost no one has attempted to interpret the features of this high temperature regime in terms of ideas or concepts of quantum criticality.@xcite the complication , of course , comes from the presence of the coexistence dome at @xmath6 , which confuses the issues , and - at least at first glance - makes the situation seem incompatible with the standard paradigm of quantum criticality .",
    "our very recent work,@xcite however , provided a new perspective .",
    "it made two key observations : ( 1 ) the characteristic temperature scale of the coexistence dome @xmath7 .",
    "the physics associated with it should , at @xmath4 , be little affected by its presence , and thus behave just as if @xmath8 , and an actual qcp would exist separating the two phases ; ( 2 ) to reveal the possible quantum critical scaling associated with the proposed `` hidden '' qcp , one must follow a judiciously chosen trajectory ( sometimes called the `` widom line''@xcite ) , as in almost any standard critical phenomenon .",
    "this work also demonstrated@xcite remarkable scaling of the resistivity curves , displaying all features expected of quantum criticality .",
    "the resistivity around this line exhibits a characteristic `` fan - shaped '' form , surprisingly similar to experimental findings in several systems,@xcite , reflecting gradual crossover from metallic to insulating transport .",
    "the scaling behavior in this high - temperature crossover regime was thus argued to encapsulate the universal features of finite temperature transport near the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "focused on behavior close to the `` instability line '' and the associated quantum critical scaling regime around it .",
    "it should be noted , however , that several other finite - temperature crossover lines have been discussed by other authors@xcite to characterize the metal - insulator region .",
    "the exact relationship between these different ideas and approaches - for the same model - thus remained an open and rather confusing issue , that needs to be carefully investigated and understood .",
    "this important task is the chief subject of this paper , where we present a detailed and very precise characterization of all the crossover regimes across the entire phase diagram for the maximally frustrated hubbard model at half - filling , within the paramagnetic solution of dynamical mean field theory .",
    "we carefully characterize the relevant crossover lines employing all the various proposed criteria used for their definitions .",
    "two fundamentally distinct crossover regions are identified : one referring to the thermal destruction of long - lived quasiparticles and the other to the gradual opening of the mott gap . the instability line , as previously determined from a thermodynamic analysis,@xcite belongs to the latter region , and is found to lie very near to the line of inflection points in the resistivity curves @xmath9 . the scaling of resistivity curves found around both of these lines is analyzed and discussed from the perspective of hidden quantum criticality and its experimental observation . in the end",
    ", we outline the generalized concept of the widom lines , and argue that they gain a new fundamental meaning in the context of quantum phase transitions , which opens an avenue to put our results into more general theoretical framework .",
    "we consider a single band hubbard model at half - filling @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron creation and annihilation operators , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , and @xmath3 is the repulsion between two electrons on the same site .",
    "we use a semicircular density of states , and the corresponding half - bandwidth @xmath15 is set to be our energy unit .",
    "we focus on the paramagnetic dmft solution , which is formally exact in the limit of large coordination number , including the maximally - frustrated hubbard model.@xcite the dmft provides a unique theoretical framework , as it works well in the entire range of model parameters , thus treating all the relevant phases and regimes on an equal footing .",
    "it is , however , most reliable at high temperatures,@xcite when the correlations are more local , and this is precisely the regime of primary interest of this paper . to solve the dmft equations we utilize both the iterated perturbation theory@xcite ( ipt ) and the numerically exact continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc).@xcite the results obtained with these two methods are found to be in very good agreement . in this section",
    "we concentrate on ipt results , which cover the entire phase diagram and do not suffer from numerical noise .",

    "deep in the mott insulator , one finds typical activation curves which exhibit the exponential drop in the resistivity with increasing temperature , due to the gap in the excitation spectrum ( black and purple ) .",
    "however , just above the coexistence dome , one finds an intermediate regime , where the behavior is generally insulating because the resistivity decreases with temperature , but the gap is not yet fully open , and the temperature dependence deviates from exponential ( blue ) .",

    "our calculations , however , show that it lies just among the crossover lines that separate the bad metal and the mott insulator , so it might not be necessary to know its exact position to observe quantum criticality . in the following , we present a scaling analysis that can be performed around the resistivity inflection points line ( or any of the other crossover lines ) to test the scaling hypothesis . as it turns out , the scaling is a robust feature , not particularly sensitive to the choice of @xmath65 as already tested in experiments on various organic mott systems.@xcite    we first observe that the resistivity curves display almost a perfect mirror symmetry when plotted on the log - scale ( fig .",

    "the notion of a crossover line is very general and different physical motivations can be used for its precise definition .",
    "the concept of the widom crossover line is , however , more strict and relies on one fundamental principle .",
    "the widom line was originally defined in the context of liquid - gas phase transition,@xcite and as the line connecting the maxima of the isobaric specific heat as a function of pressure ( @xmath148 ) , above @xmath1 .",
    "it was conceived as a logical continuation of the first order phase transition line to supercritical temperatures .",
    "@xmath149 is divergent along the first order transition line , which directly causes the maxima in @xmath149 present above the critical temperature .",
    "this concept is easily generalized to include all the lines that mark features directly caused by non - analyticities due to a phase transition.@xcite as such , a widom line can be defined for any quantity that exhibits either a divergence or a discontinuity because of a phase transition , and thus a maximum or an inflection point above @xmath1 .",
    "very recently,@xcite in the super - critical region of argon liquid - gas phase diagram , an unexpected non - analyticity has been found in sound velocity dispersion curves , precisely at the widom line .",
    "the authors give a new depth and physical meaning to the concept , by observing that there is no single super - critical fluid phase , and that the widom line actually separates two regimes of fluid - like and gas - like dynamical behavior .",
    "this finding makes it clear that the widom lines should not be exclusively connected with thermodynamics of the system .",
    "the changes in transport that follow certain features in thermodynamic quantities can also be used for making meaningful and possibly even equivalent definition of the widom line .",
    "the significance of this concept was recognized once more@xcite in the context of hole - doped high-@xmath1 superconductors , where the characteristic temperature @xmath150 of the pseudogap phase is shown to correspond to the widom line arising above a first - order transition at critical doping .    in the above sense , we emphasize that the quantum critical scaling observed in our model can also be easily connected with the concept of widom lines , giving them new physical importance in the context of quantum phase transitions .",
    "one can immediately recognize that the @xmath49 inflection - point line and the instability line both qualify as generalized widom lines - they emanate from the the critical end - point , separate regions of metallic and insulating behavior and mark features that are directly caused by non - analyticities due to the phase transition .",
    "the quality of the scaling and the close proximity of these two lines may even indicate a profound connection between them . as the proposed physical concept may well surpass the scope of the hubbard model and mott physics",
    ", a definition of the instability line can be very useful .",
    "contrary to the inflection - point line , it is based on a purely thermodynamical quantity , i.e. the free energy , and can be defined for an arbitrary model .",
    "it does not require the presence of the finite - temperature critical point ( which makes a conceptual difference with the work@xcite on hole - doped cuprates ) and can be used to introduce the widom line concept to exclusively zero temperature quantum - phase transitions .",
    "in this paper we carefully investigated the finite temperature crossover behavior around the mott transition , with the goal to provide both theoretical insight and experimental guidance for the search of quantum criticality in this regime . to obtain quantitative and reliable results that allow direct comparison with experiments , we performed these studies within the framework of single - site dynamical mean - field theory . from the conceptual point of view",
    ", this approach offers an immediate advantage - it is physically very clear what kinds of mechanisms and processes are captured by such a theory , and which are not .",
    "most importantly , such an approach explicitly excludes all mechanisms directly or indirectly associated with any ordering tendencies , in agreement with the physical pictures for the mott transition introduced by early pioneering ideas of mott and anderson .",
    "more specifically , we focused on a single band half - filled hubbard model , which within dmft maps to solving a kondo - anderson magnetic impurity model in a self - consistently determined bath .",
    "the formation of the heavy fermi liquid on the metallic side of the mott transition is described as a formation of a kondo - like singlet in the ground state , similarly as in the early work of brinkmann and rice.@xcite in contrast to the brinkmann - rice theory , the dmft approach is able to quantitatively and accurately describe the thermal destruction of such a correlated fermi liquid , and the resulting coherence - incoherence crossover . the possibility to systematically and quantitatively describe",
    "this incoherent regime is especially important to properly characterize the high temperature crossover behavior above the coexistence dome , where we obtained clear and precise signatures of quantum critical behavior .",
    "our results show remarkable agreement with several experimental systems,@xcite but future experiments should provide even more precise tests for our predictions .",
    "we expect that close enough to the quantum critical point all quantities should display appropriate scaling behaviors .",
    "our work has , so far , focused mostly on the transport properties , and sufficiently detailed results for thermodynamic and other quantities are not available at this time , to permit a scaling analysis .",
    "the investigation of these interesting questions is beyond the scope of the present work , and is left for future studies .    we should mention that ideas closely related to ours have also been discussed in a series of papers by senthil and collaborators,@xcite who also seek a description of mott quantum criticality unrelated to any ordering phenomena",
    "this approach , however , focuses on capturing the possible effects of gapless `` spinon '' excitations , which may exist on the insulating side of the mott transition , but only in presence of sufficient and specific magnetic frustration , preventing the familiar antiferromagnetic order . because of their gapless nature",
    ", they should remain long - lived ( e.g. well defined ) only at the lowest temperatures , inducing long - range spatial correlations in the proposed spin liquid . the corresponding theory ,",
    "therefore , focuses on long - distance spatial fluctuations , which as in ordinary critical phenomena , are tackled by appropriate renormalization - group methods .",
    "in contrast to our dmft approach , this theory implicitly disregards the strongly incoherent kondo - like processes , which may play the dominant role at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "the key physical question thus remains : what is the crossover temperature @xmath151 below which the nonlocal effects ignored by dmft become significant ?",
    "this important question can , in principle , be investigated by computing systematic nonlocal corrections to single - site dmft , a research direction already investigated by several authors.@xcite the recent work already provides some evidence that for a hubbard model on a square lattice the nonlocal corrections are very small well above the coexistence dome ( at @xmath4)@xcite and esentially negligible for frustrated triangular lattice.@xcite on the experimental side , the possible role of nonlocal effects such as spinons can be investigated by systematic studies of a series of materials with varying degrees of magnetic frustration .",
    "such studies are accessible in organic mott systems,@xcite where @xmath152 , while the magnetic frustration may be varied using different crystal lattices . in some cases the magnetic ordering is completely suppressed on the insulating side,@xcite while in other it remains.@xcite if robust signatures of quantum criticality in transport are observed at @xmath4 in all of these materials , this finding would provide strong support for the `` local quantum criticality '' scenario we proposed based on the dmft approach .",
