    "traffic jams or congestions occur essentially due to the excluded volume effects ( among the vehicles ) in a single road and due to the cooperative ( traffic ) load sharing by the ( free ) lanes or roads in multiply connected road networks ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will discuss here briefly how the fiber bundle model ( fbm ) for fracture failure in composite materials ( see e.g , @xcite ) can be easily adopted for the study of ( global ) traffic jam in a city network of roads . in the equal - load - sharing fbm , the load carried by the failed fibers is transferred and shared uniformly by the other surviving fibers in the bundle and therefore the dynamics of failure propagation in the system is analytically tractable @xcite . using this model for the traffic network ,",
    "it is shown here that the generic equation for the approach of the jamming transition in fbm corresponds to that for the asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) leading to the transport failure transition in a single channel or lane ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let the suburban highway traffic , while entering the city , get fragmented equally through the various narrower streets within the city and get combined again outside the city ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . let the input traffic current be denoted by @xmath0 and the total output traffic current be denoted by @xmath1 . in the steady state , without any global traffic jam , @xmath2 . in case",
    ", @xmath1 falls below @xmath0 , the global jam starts and soon @xmath1 drops to zero .",
    "this occurs if @xmath3 , the traffic current in the network beyond which global traffic jam occurs .",
    "the steady state flow picture then looks as shown in fig .",
    "2 . let us assume that the parallel roads within the city have got different thresholds for traffic handling capacity : @xmath4 for the @xmath5 different roads ( the @xmath6-th road gets jammed if the traffic current @xmath7 per road exceeds @xmath8 ) .",
    "initially @xmath9 and increases as some of the roads get jammed and the same traffic load @xmath10 has to be shared equally by a lower number of unjammed roads .",
    "next , we assume that the distribution @xmath11 of these thresholds is uniform ( see fig .",
    "3 ) upto a maximum threshold current ( corresponding to the widest road traffic current capacity ) , which is normalized to unity ( sets the scale for @xmath12 ) .",
    "[ themodel ]    the jamming dynamics in this model starts from the @xmath6-th road ( say in the morning ) when the traffic load @xmath13 per city roads exceeds the threshold @xmath8 of that road . due to this jam",
    ", total number of intact or uncongested roads decreases and rest of these roads have to bear the entire traffic load in the system . hence effective traffic load or stress on the uncongested roads increases and this compels some more roads to fail or get jammed .",
    "these two sequential operations , namely the stress or traffic load redistribution and further failure in service of roads continue till an equilibrium is reached , where either the surviving roads are strong ( wide ) enough to share equally and carry the entire traffic load on the system ( for @xmath14 ) or all the roads fail ( for @xmath15 ) and a ( global ) traffic jam occurs in the entire ) road network system ( to be brought back perhaps in the night when the load @xmath0 decreases much below @xmath12 ) .",
    "this jamming dynamics can be represented by recursion relations in discrete time steps .",
    "let us define @xmath16 to be the fraction of uncontested roads in the network that survive after ( discrete ) time step @xmath17 , counted from the time @xmath18 when the load ( at the level @xmath19 ) is put in the system ( time step indicates the number of stress redistributions ) .",
    "as such , @xmath20 for all @xmath17 and @xmath21 for @xmath18 for any @xmath7 ; @xmath22 for @xmath23 if @xmath14 , and @xmath24 for @xmath23 if @xmath25 .",
    "[ thejam ]    [ uniform ]    therefore @xmath26 follows a simple recursion relation ( see fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath27 @xmath28 in equilibrium @xmath29 and thus ( 1 ) is quadratic in @xmath30 : @xmath31    the solution is    @xmath32    here @xmath33 is the critical value of traffic current ( per road ) beyond which the bundle fails completely .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 must be real valued as it has a physical meaning : it is the fraction of the roads that remains in service under a fixed traffic load @xmath7 when the traffic load per road lies in the range @xmath35 . clearly , @xmath36 .",
    "the solution with ( @xmath37 ) sign is therefore the only physical one .",
    "hence , the physical solution can be written as @xmath38 for @xmath39 we can not get a real - valued fixed point as the dynamics never stops until @xmath40 when the network gets completely jammed .",
    "* ( a ) at @xmath41 * .2 in it may be noted that the quantity @xmath42 behaves like an order parameter that determines a transition from a state of partial failure of the system(@xmath43 ) to a state of total failure ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath44    to study the dynamics away from criticality ( @xmath45 from below ) , we replace the recursion relation ( [ recu_t ] ) by a differential equation @xmath46    close to the fixed point we write @xmath47 + @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath50    where @xmath51   $ ] .",
    "thus , near the critical point ( for jamming transition ) we can write @xmath52 therefore the relaxation time diverges following a power - law as @xmath53 from below",
    ".    one can also consider the breakdown susceptibility @xmath54 , defined as the change of @xmath34 due to an infinitesimal increment of the traffic stress @xmath55",
    "@xmath56    hence the susceptibility diverges as the applied stress @xmath57 approaches the critical value @xmath58 .",
    "such a divergence in @xmath54 can be clearly observed in the numerical study of these dynamics .",
    ".2 in * ( b ) at * * @xmath59 *    .2 in at the critical point ( @xmath60 ) , we observe a different dynamic critical behavior in the relaxation of the failure process . from the recursion relation ( [ recu_t ] ) , it can be shown that decay of the fraction @xmath61 of uncongested roads that remain in service at time @xmath62 follows a simple power - law decay : @xmath63    starting from @xmath64 . for large @xmath62 ( @xmath65 ) , this reduces to @xmath66 ; @xmath67 ; a power law , and is a robust characterization of the critical state .",
    "the universality class of the model can be checked ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) taking two other types of road capacity distributions @xmath68",
    ": ( i ) linearly increasing density distribution and ( ii ) linearly decreasing density distribution of the current thresholds within the limit @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "one can show that while @xmath71 changes with different strength distributions ( @xmath72 for case ( i ) and @xmath73 for case ii ) , the critical behavior remains unchanged : @xmath74 , @xmath75 for all these equal ( traffic ) load sharing models .",
    "[ theasep ]    let us consider the simplest version of the asymmetric simple exclusion process transport in a chain ( see fig .",
    "transport corresponds to movement of vehicles , which is possible only when a vehicle at site @xmath7 , say , moves to the vacant site @xmath76 .",
    "the transport current @xmath77 is then given by ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the site occupation density at site @xmath7 and @xmath80 denotes the inter - site hopping probability .",
    "the above equation can be easily recast in the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "formally it is the same as the recursion relation ( 1 ) for the density of uncongested roads in the fbm model discussed above ; the site index here in asep plays the role of time index in fbm .",
    "we have applied here the equal load - sharing fiber bundle model of fracture failure in composite materials to model the traffic failure in a network of parallel roads in a city .",
    "for some special distributions of traffic handling capacities ( thresholds ) of the roads , namely uniform and also linearly increasing or decreasing density of road capacities , the critical behavior of the jamming transition has been studied analytically .",
    "this dynamics of traffic jam progression ( given by the recursion relation ( 1 ) , for uniform density of road capacity , as shown in fig .",
    "3 ) has been compared with that for the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( 9 ) in a single channel or road ; the exact correspondence indicates identical critical behavior in both the cases .",
    "the same universality for other cases of @xmath83 in fbm suggests similar behavior for other equivalent asep cases as well .",
