    "we equip @xmath13 with the natural log structure induced by its special fibre @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the resulting log scheme : we refer to @xcite for the basic terminology .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 denotes @xmath5 equipped with the log structure induced by @xmath7 . a beautiful result of nakayama ( * ? ? ? * corollary 0.1.1 ) says that if the morphism of log schemes @xmath18 is _ log smooth _ ,",
    "then the action of the wild inertia group @xmath19 on @xmath20 is trivial ; a variety with the latter property will be said to be _ cohomologically tame_. it is natural to ask when the converse holds : given a smooth , proper variety @xmath21 over @xmath0 which is cohomologically tame , can one conclude that there exists a proper model @xmath13 over @xmath5 which is log smooth ?",
    "of course this question can only be interesting in the case of mixed or positive characteristic , since both cohomological tameness and the existence of a proper , log smooth model are automatic if the residual characteristic is zero .      the answer to the question raised above",
    "is known to be affirmative when @xmath21 is a curve of genus at least @xmath22 , due to the work of t. saito @xcite and stix @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the answer to the question is already negative for some genus @xmath23 curves :    [ example ] assume that @xmath3 is algebraically closed of characteristic @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be an elliptic curve over @xmath0 with semistable bad reduction .",
    "let @xmath21 be a torsor under @xmath25 of period @xmath4 ; by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.6 , corollary 6.7 ) , such a torsor exists , and moreover the `` type '' of the special fibre @xmath15 of its minimal regular proper model @xmath13 with strict normal crossings is obtained by multiplying the corresponding type for @xmath25 by @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath21 is certainly cohomologically tame ( since @xmath25 is ) , but the argument in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.2 ) shows that @xmath21 does _ not _ have logarithmic good reduction in this case .",
    "indeed , the morphism @xmath26 is not log smooth at the points in @xmath15 where the log structure has rank @xmath22 .",
    "it is not clear what to expect in higher dimension , but note that proving the existence of a proper , log smooth model is really proving a version of resolution of singularities : the existence of such a model implies the existence of a proper , regular model with strict normal crossings by @xcite .",
    "hence this problem is likely to be hard in higher dimension !    the goal of this short note is to prove such a result for abelian varieties .",

    "shafarevich criterion proven by serre ",
    "tate ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) , and it is the natural complement for abelian varieties to the work of t. saito and stix on curves mentioned above .",
    "of course only one implication is new ( as mentioned above , the other one is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 0.1.1 ) ) :    [ maintheorem ] let @xmath1 be an abelian variety over @xmath0",
    ". then @xmath1 is cohomologically tame if and only if there exists a projective model @xmath13 of @xmath1 over @xmath5 such that @xmath26 is log smooth .    for abelian varieties ,",
    "the cohomological tameness condition is equivalent to the galois action on the @xmath12-adic tate module being tamely ramified .",
    "it is classical that this is the case whenever @xmath4 is sufficiently large .",
    "in fact , @xmath27 suffices ; this can be deduced from grothendieck s results ( * ? ? ? * proposition 3.5 , thorme 4.3 ) ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "our result does not extend to arbitrary torsors under abelian varieties , as example [ example ] illustrates .    as an immediate corollary of our result",
    ", we obtain the following generalization of an important result of knnemann ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.5 ) , who proves the existence of projective , regular models in the case of semi - abelian reduction , i.e. unipotent galois action :    let @xmath1 be a cohomologically tame abelian variety over @xmath0 .",
    "then there exists a projective regular model @xmath13 of @xmath1 over @xmath5 , with @xmath15 a strict normal crossings divisor .    since the model @xmath16 from theorem [ maintheorem ] is log smooth over the log regular scheme @xmath28 , it is log regular ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.2 ) .",
    "hence @xmath16 can be desingularized using log blow - ups ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , yielding the desired regular model .",
    "the original motivation for this note lies in the recent paper @xcite , where the second author proved a trace formula conjectured by nicaise for the class of varieties having `` logarithmic good reduction '' .",
    "such a formula had been proven for cohomologically tame semi - abelian varieties by halle ",
    "nicaise @xcite .",
    "hence theorem [ maintheorem ] shows that their result in the case of abelian varieties is a special case of the main result of @xcite .",
    "we work with log structures in the tale topology .",
    "the theory of log regularity and desingularization by log blow - ups has been developed by kato for zariski log structures @xcite ; however , nizio  @xcite showed that starting from an tale log structure , one can essentially produce a zariski log structure using suitable log blow - ups .",
    "for our purposes , we can ( and will ) use kato s theory in the tale setting , without further mention .",
    "we are grateful to dan abramovich , lars halle , luc illusie , klaus knnemann , johannes nicaise , martin olsson , takeshi saito and heer zhao for useful discussions , and to the referee for a careful reading .",

    "the second - named author is a postdoctoral fellow of fwo vlaanderen ( research foundation",
    " flanders ) .",
    "let us now prove the main result .",
    "the essential observation is that a deep theorem of gabber ( written down by illusie  temkin in @xcite ) on quotients of varieties equipped with a tame group action combines very well with the theory of degenerations of abelian varieties due to mumford and faltings  chai , especially in its `` equivariant '' version developed by knnemann @xcite .",
    "we keep the notation used in the introduction ; in particular , we assume that @xmath1 is a cohomologically tame abelian variety .",
    "we start with a very easy observation :    [ tamextension ] there exists a tame extension @xmath30 such that @xmath31 has semistable reduction , i.e. there exists a semi - abelian scheme @xmath32 which is a model of @xmath31 over @xmath33 .",

    "[ def : compactification ] there exists a flat , projective @xmath40-scheme @xmath41 such that    1 .",

    "we now explain why this follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.5 ) .",
    "we refer to the beautifully written paper @xcite for more background , details and terminology .",
    "we start with a line bundle @xmath47 on @xmath32 which is symmetric , @xmath40-ample and @xmath43-equivariant . to construct it , choose any ample , symmetric line bundle on @xmath1 , and consider its pullback to @xmath31 ; a sufficiently high power of the latter will extend to a line bundle on @xmath32 with all of the desired properties .",
    "the pair @xmath48 determines the so - called raynaud extension ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) : a global extension ( over @xmath40 ) given by a short exact sequence @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a torus of constant rank and @xmath51 is an abelian scheme .",
    "we may and will assume @xmath50 to be split : this can be achieved using a finite tale base change , which is completely harmless for our purposes ( as will be clear from what follows ) .",
    "the line bundle @xmath47 induces a cubical , ample line bundle @xmath52 on @xmath53 which , under our assumptions , descends to a non - unique ample line bundle @xmath54 on @xmath51 ( i.e. @xmath55 ) .",
    "fixing such a line bundle yields an object @xmath56 in the category @xmath57 , in the notation of @xcite .",

    "let @xmath70 be such a decomposition , the existence of which follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) .",
    "knnemann actually needs a decomposition into _ smooth _ cones , for the construction of regular models .",
    "however , any @xmath70 as above will suit our needs .",
    "we will now verify that knnemann s method ( applied to @xmath70 ) yields a model with the properties listed in theorem [ def : compactification ] .",
    "the only thing we need to check is the log smoothness property ; everything else works as in the proof of ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ logsmooth ] the resulting map of fs log schemes @xmath81 is log smooth .",

    "the group @xmath83 is a subgroup of @xmath84 which contains @xmath85 .",
    "an easy calculation shows that @xmath86 simply maps @xmath87 isomorphically onto the last factor .",

    "since @xmath70 admits a suitable polarization function , we get a @xmath50-linearized ample line bundle on @xmath89 which we denote by @xmath91 .",
    "the pair @xmath92 inherits an action of @xmath43 .",

    "3 ) for the data ( [ degdata ] ) , and that the @xmath43-action extends to this model . we have to check that @xmath95 is log smooth over @xmath45 : this follows from lemma [ logsmooth ] and the fact that zariski locally on @xmath51 , the contracted product @xmath96 looks like @xmath97 .    to construct the pair @xmath98 as in theorem [ def : compactification ] , we apply mumford s construction to @xmath94 , as in @xcite . again",
    "the only additional statement to check is that @xmath44 is log smooth over @xmath45 .",
    "it suffices to check that the fibres are log smooth , by the lemma in the appendix . for the generic fibre",
    "this is clear .",
    "concerning the special fibre , we have an tale , strict morphism of formal log schemes @xmath99 restricting to the closed point @xmath100 yields an tale , strict morphism @xmath101 . since @xmath102 is log smooth over @xmath103 , so is @xmath104 .",
    "these arguments ( together with all of the work in @xcite ) prove theorem [ def : compactification ] .",
    "we will now use gabber s theorem to prove our main result .",
    "let us briefly recall the notion of a _ very tame group action _ on a log scheme , which is the essential player in gabber s result .",
    "as in @xcite , an action of a finite group @xmath43 on an fs log scheme @xmath105 is said to be _ tame _ if for every geometric point @xmath106 lying over a point @xmath107 of @xmath21 , the order of the stabilizer @xmath108 is prime to the characteristic of the residue field at @xmath107 .",
    "the action is said to be _ very tame _ if it is tame , and for every geometric point @xmath106 , the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath43 acts trivially on @xmath109 , and @xmath108 acts trivially on the scheme @xmath110 , where as usual @xmath111 denotes the ideal of @xmath112 generated by @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath41 be as in theorem [ def : compactification ] ; we can forget @xmath46 at this stage . since the morphism @xmath114 is log tale ,",
    "the composition @xmath115 is a log smooth morphism of fs log schemes endowed with a @xmath43-action .    the hypotheses of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) are satisfied .",
    "note that @xmath37 can have order divisible by @xmath4 : one may need a tamely ramified extension , with ( necessarily separable ) residue field extension of degree divisible by @xmath4 , for @xmath50 in the proof of theorem 2.2 to become split .",
    "but @xmath43 acts tamely since the elements of @xmath43 which stabilize a _",
    "geometric _ point of the special fibre lie in the inertia subgroup , which does have order prime to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore ( * ? ? ?",
    "cit . ) yields the existence of a projective modification @xmath116 such that @xmath117 is an fs log scheme , log smooth over @xmath45 and the @xmath43-action on @xmath117 is now _ very _ tame .",
    "this modification does not affect the generic fibre of @xmath41 .",
    "the quotient @xmath118 exists as a scheme since @xmath119 is projective over @xmath40 ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.2 ) ) , and the resulting fs log scheme @xmath16 is log smooth over @xmath28 by gabber s theorem .",
    "hence @xmath13 is our desired model .",
    "we used the following lemma , which is more general than needed .",
    "it may however be of independent interest ( we could not locate such a result in the literature ) .",
    "* _ lemma .",
    " _ * _ let @xmath120 be an integral morphism of fine log schemes with log smooth fibres , such that the morphism of underlying schemes @xmath121 is locally of finite presentation and flat .",

    "to prove this , we use olsson s theory of stacks of log structures @xcite .    by ( * ?",
    "* ( ii ) ) , it suffices to show that the induced morphism @xmath123 of algebraic stacks is formally smooth . by our assumptions",
    ", it is locally of finite presentation ; hence it suffices to show that ( [ lemm : logmap ] ) is flat and that its geometric fibres are smooth .",

    "let @xmath125 be a geometric point .",
    "this yields a morphism of fine log schemes @xmath126 , which need not be strict : one obtains @xmath127 as the image of @xmath128 in @xmath129 .",
    "now @xmath130 is given by the cartesian diagram      ( in the category of fine log schemes ) and the underlying scheme @xmath133 is the fibre product in the category of schemes , since the morphism @xmath134 is integral . by our assumptions on the fibres ,",
    "the morphism @xmath135 is log smooth .",
    "in particular , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( ii ) ) implies that @xmath136 is smooth .",
    "by @xcite , we have an isomorphism @xmath137 base change along the open immersion @xmath138 shows that the induced morphism @xmath139 is indeed smooth .",
    "hence it remains to show that ( [ lemm : logmap ] ) is flat , or that @xmath122 is log flat .",
