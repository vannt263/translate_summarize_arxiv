    "the field of multiphase microfluidics has expanded greatly in the last decade because of the numerous applications of the technique in chemistry and biology @xcite . transporting reactants through microchannels in the form of bubbles or droplets",
    "has many advantages over the traditional single - phase systems .",
    "these include enhanced mixing rate , reduced dispersion and higher interface areas @xcite .",
    "however there are still many technological problems that remain unsolved .",
    "a particular problem that aroused our attention is the control of spacing within a train of long droplets or plugs carried along the channel by a wetting fluid .",
    "such plugs are separated from the tube by a thin lubricating film , whose thickness is controlled by the speed of motion @xcite .",
    "it is commonly observed @xcite that the separation between the plugs changes as they move .",
    "eventually one plug can coalesce with its neighbor , a process known as the catch - up effect . to our knowledge",
    "there is no widely accepted explanation of this effect . +",
    "a change in the distance between neighboring plugs is possible only if the fluid flux in the lubricating layer is different in the two plugs .",
    "thus in order to understand the reason for the catch - up effect one needs to analyze the shape and dynamics of this lubricating layer .",
    "there are many physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the structure of the lubricating layer . in this work",
    "we analyze only one of them : irregularities of the channel shape .",
    "we argue that these irregularities , _",
    "i.e. _ roughness of the tube wall , could be responsible for the fluctuations of the distance between the plugs .",
    "the influence of the substrate geometry or roughness on the lubricating layer thickness has been recognized for several decades and has been studied quite extensively ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the present work we consider an effect beyond the direct affect on speeds .",
    "we find that the roughness enhances dramatically the sensitivity of the thin film width to the plug length , and thus produces speed variations between individual plugs that might eventually lead to catch - up coalescence events .",
    "+ the earliest discussion of the roughness effect on the plug motion inside capillary tubes dates back to the seminal paper of bretherton @xcite .",
    "he suggested that the roughness can be important if its amplitude is comparable to or larger than the lubricating layer thickness .",
    "therefore the roughness effect is usually negligible for large enough tubes where other physical mechanisms are more important ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite for review ) .",
    "however as modern microfluidic channels become smaller , surface roughness becomes more important relative to the channel width .",
    "probably the first experimental observation that is attributed to the effect of roughness is reported in the work of chen @xcite , where deviations from the bretherton s predictions were observed for small capillary numbers @xmath0 .",
    "+ on the theoretical side the most widely studied effect of the surface roughness corresponds to the limit where the roughness amplitude is significantly smaller than the lubricating film thickness . in this case",
    "the roughness effect can be accounted for via effective boundary conditions : the rough surface can be modeled as a smooth one with non - zero slip length determined by the roughness properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "krechetnikov and homsy @xcite have analyzed the effect of the slip length on the lubricating film profile , and showed that the effect is negligible for the slip length smaller than the bretherton thin film thickness , but leads to a dramatic increase of the lubricating film thickness in the opposite limit : in this case the lubricating film thickness becomes comparable to the slip length and is independent of @xmath0 . in a broader context there have been a numerous studies on how the channel geometry affects the dynamics and shape of plugs .",
    "wong et al .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) considered the plug motion in polygonal channels and showed that the shape of the plug strongly depends on the capillary number and that in the limit @xmath2 , the fluid flux in the lubricating film does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "hazel and heil @xcite confirmed this effect by numerical simulations , and showed that a similar behavior is observed in tubes with elliptical cross - sections as well .",
    "it should also be noted that the surface roughness can have a non - hydrodynamic effect on the plug motion by changing wetting properties of the surface ( @xcite ) or dynamical destabilization of the lubricating layer due to fluctuations .",
    "+ in this work we consider capillary tubes with roughness smaller than the lubricating film thickness .",
    "in this regime the roughness can not produce any significant effect on the width of the lubricating layer .",
    "however , as we will show , in the rough tube the decay length of the plug shape to its infinite - length limit is increased dramatically . in some cases ,",
    "the decay length becomes comparable to or even larger than the tube radius .",
    "the ripples of the plug shape propagate from the front region to the rear region of the plug , leading to a much - enhanced dependence of the fluid flux on the plug length . on the level of the plug train this effect",
    "translates the variations of plug speeds to the fluctuations of the distance between them .",
    "thus it can be responsible for the catch - up events .",
    "we also note that this is essentially a non - local effect . to our knowledge",
    "this effect has not been discussed perviously .",
    "+ we will illustrate this effect by using a very simple system , a single air plug of finite length moving through an almost cylindrical tube .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , throughout the paper we neglect the effects of gravity , inertia and surfactant concentrations , assuming that the only relevant stresses are due to surface tension and viscosity .",
    "we also limit our analysis to the small capillary number regime : @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the tube roughness can be modeled as weakly non - circular cross sections of the tube , which does not change in the longitudinal direction and can be described by a roughness function @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the azimuthal angle .",
    "we will consider the situation where the deformation is smooth enough for the lubrication approximation to be valid , that is , @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ the deformation is small compared to the bretherton s thin film thickness .",
    "however , we expect that our scaling results can be safely extrapolated to the regime : @xmath6 .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start our analysis by revisiting the classical bretherton solution for the semi - infinite air plug moving in the perfectly cylindrical tube .",
    "then we follow the finite - plug analysis of teletzke @xcite and extend it to a wider range of plug length .",
    "the main finding of this section is the exponential suppression of the speed corrections due to the plug length variations : @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 measures the length of the plug , and @xmath9 is the characteristic decay length of the plug shape to its infinite - length limit for the smooth tube case . in section 3 we explain that the presence of small tube roughness produces a whole spectrum of relaxation modes with different decay lengths @xmath10 .",
    "the relaxation mode with the decay length @xmath11 provides the largest contribution to the dependence on the plug length . in section 4",
    "we estimate of the amplitude of the plug shape distortion due to the roughness .",
    "then we estimate the effect of tube roughness on the finite plug speed in section 5 .",
    "we conclude in section 6 by discussing the limitations of the model and proposing future research directions .",
    "suppose we have a smooth cylindrical capillary tube with radius @xmath1 .",
    "it is initially filled with a liquid of viscosity @xmath12 , which is called the carrier fluid in the following discussion .",
    "now an air plug with negligible viscosity is forced into the tube and moves slowly together with the carrier fluid due to a pressure gradient along the tube . as discussed in detail later",
    ", the plug speed @xmath13 is different from the speed @xmath14 of the carrier fluid far away from the plug @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will investigate the effect of the plug length on the plug speed @xmath13 .",
    "both gravitational and inertial effects are assumed to be negligible .",
    "+      in bretherton s seminal work @xcite , he studied the limit case of semi - infinite air plug motion .",
    "he showed that a dimensionless number @xmath0 , called capillary number , controls the plug motion : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an interfacial tension between the plug and the carrier fluid .",
    "bretherton s steady state solution of a semi - infinite plug is illustrated in fig.[fig:1:brethertonshape ] . for convenience",
    ", we have chosen the plug as the frame of reference . in this frame , the tube wall moves with velocity @xmath17 .",
    "the shape of a semi - infinite plug consists of three regions : a spherical cap ( static region ) is connected to a thin film region of almost constant liquid film thickness @xmath18 via a transition remobilization region . since the internal viscosity of the plug is zero , there can be no shear stress at the plug surface .",
    "thus the carrier fluid in the thin film region moves without shear at the wall speed @xmath13 .",
    "bretherton also found that the lubricating film thickness decays exponentially with a decay length @xmath19 , denoted as @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath20 is a measure of the length of the remobilization region .",
    "both capillary force and viscous force are important in the remobilization region , where the plug shape is determined by an equilibrium between these two forces . in the limit of small capillary numbers , @xmath21 , bretherton derived the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath22 obviously , both @xmath20 and @xmath18 are much less than @xmath1 for small capillary numbers .",
    "relative motion between the plug and the carrier fluid is governed by an incompressibility constraint .",
    "this constraint states that , in the steady state , the total volume of the plug and the carrier fluid between two arbitrary cross sections along the tube does nt change over time .",
    "mathematically , it can be translated into the equation : @xmath23 . by keeping only the lowest order approximation",
    ", we get : @xmath24 strictly speaking , eqn.([eqn:1:breuv ] ) is only valid in the limit of the semi - infinite plug . for a finite plug ,",
    "we expect eqn.([eqn:1:breuv ] ) to be modified as @xcite : @xmath25 , with @xmath26 different from its limiting value @xmath18 . physically speaking , @xmath27 represents the average carrier fluid flux per unit circumference . as shown in detail later",
    ", @xmath26 depends on the plug length and approaches @xmath18 as we increase the length .",
    "+    the motion of a finite - length air plug in a capillary tube was first studied by teletzke @xcite . in the following discussion length , velocity , and pressure",
    "are made dimensionless by using tube radius @xmath1 , plug speed @xmath13 , and capillary pressure @xmath28 .",
    "capillary number was kept small in teletzke s analysis : @xmath2 . by imposing a lubrication approximation and appropriate boundary conditions ( non - slip condition at the tube wall and stress - free condition at the plug surface ) , the balance of viscous and capillary pressure gradients yields @xcite : @xmath29 wherever @xmath30 . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "this includes both the thin film region and the remobilization region . for a plug of fixed length ,",
    "@xmath26 is a self - consistent parameter whose value is determined by the fact that remobilization regions must match with spherical caps at the plug ends .",
    "suppose the front and rear remobilization regions are separated by a distance @xmath8 for a finite plug .",
    "teletzke proposed a method to solve the above differential equation numerically in the limit of short plugs : @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "numerical results obtained by using teletzke s method are plotted in fig.[fig:1:teletzke ] . as expected",
    ", @xmath26 approaches @xmath18 as the plug length increases .",
    "however , the trend is not monotonic .",
    "the origin of this oscillating behavior will be clear in the next section .",
    "+     on the plug length @xmath8 obtained by using teletzke s method.,width=480 ]    teletzke s method did not address the asymptotic behavior for finite plugs with length : @xmath32 .",
    "so the knowledge of the dependence of the plug speed on the plug length is incomplete at the current stage .",
    "we only understand two limit cases : bretherton s semi - infinite plugs and teletzke s short plugs with @xmath33 . in the next section ,",
    "we complete this previously unstudied part of the plug speed problem , by determining the asymptotic behavior of @xmath26 for plugs with large @xmath8 .",
    "+      due to rotational symmetry , the problem of determining plug shape is reduced to calculating a lubricating film thickness .",
    "the governing equation of @xmath34 is given by eqn.([eqn:1:shapeode ] ) .",
    "for small capillary numbers @xmath0 , this differential equation is valid in both the thin film and the remobilization region , as noted above .",
    "its solution has to match spherical caps at the ends of remobilization regions . by using the rescalings : @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we may rewrite eqn.([eqn:1:shapeode ] ) as : @xmath37 in the above substitutions , @xmath38 is the remobilization length of the finite plug defined as : @xmath39 .",
    "comparing with eqn.([eqn:1:linf&hinf ] ) , we observe that @xmath40 measures thickness in units comparable to the asymptotic thin film thickness @xmath18 . likewise @xmath41",
    "evidently measures lengths in units comparable to the remobilization length @xmath20 .",
    "we denote the plug length @xmath8 in these units as @xmath42 .",
    "so in this section we will study long plugs with @xmath43 .",
    "+ as we approach the thin film region , @xmath40 becomes arbitrarily close to 1 : @xmath44 .",
    "so we can simplify eqn.([eqn:1:newshapeode ] ) as follows : @xmath45 .",
    "this autonomous equation has solutions of the form : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "it has three roots @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which correspond to three solution modes given below : @xmath50 so general solutions are linear combinations of these modes , and we have : @xmath51 where coefficients @xmath52 are determined from boundary conditions away from the thin film region .",
    "we note for future reference that for large positive @xmath41 , @xmath40 is dominated by the growing @xmath53 function .",
    "+ far from the thin film region treated above , the following relation is valid : @xmath54 .",
    "for very small @xmath0 , lubrication approximation ( @xmath55 ) is still applicable in this regime @xcite .",
    "so eqn.([eqn:1:newshapeode ] ) can be approximated as follows : @xmath56 .",
    "integration of this equation yields parabolic profiles : @xmath57 where superscripts @xmath58 and @xmath1 stand for front and rear solutions , respectively .",
    "as defined by teletzke @xcite , axial ( @xmath59-direction ) positions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in fig.[fig:1:finiteshape ] , correspond to axial positions of the lowest points of front and rear parabolas . and",
    "he defined the distance between @xmath60 and @xmath61 as the plug length @xmath8 .",
    "we will keep teletzke s definition in the following discussion .",
    "+ since both ends of the plug are spherical caps for small @xmath0 , mean curvatures far from the thin film region must match those of spherical caps . as a result , the following constraint needs to be satisfied near the spherical cap : @xmath62 .",
    "we may rewrite this constraint in terms of reduced variables : @xmath63 . by using asymptotic solutions of @xmath40 given in eqn.([eqn:1:parabolas ] ) , we get : @xmath64 since @xmath26 is fixed for a given plug , the above equation implies that @xmath65 .",
    "so we can drop the superscript from now on . for a semi - infinite plug , we shall use bretherton s result for @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to the limit value of @xmath66 as the plug length goes to infinity : @xmath67 .",
    "as derived in detail in the appendix of this paper , the dependence of the curvature @xmath66 on the plug length @xmath42 for finite long plugs is given by : @xmath68 , where functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 are linear combinations of modes @xmath71 and @xmath72 , defined in eqn.([eqn:1:delta23exp ] ) . by using the constant curvature constraint derived above , we have : @xmath73 this is the dependence of @xmath26 on the dimensionless plug length @xmath42 .",
    "it can be easily transformed to represent the dependence on @xmath8 via the scaling relation : @xmath74 .",
    "thus the thickness @xmath26 oscillates around @xmath18 with an amplitude that decays as @xmath8 increases , and with a decay length of order @xmath38 . strictly speaking , the above derivation",
    "is only valid in the regime : @xmath43 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are arbitrarily small .",
    "for illustrative purpose , we extrapolate our analytic results to teletzke s short - plug regime and make a comparison between data obtained via two methods in fig.[fig:1:ourwork ] .",
    "deviation between two sets of data is obvious for short plugs , where teletzke s method is more accurate . for short plugs in the teletzke s regime , contributions from all modes are important .",
    "different modes interact nonlinearly , which leads to a much stronger finite - length effect , as shown in fig.[fig:1:teletzke ] .",
    "around @xmath75 the data obtained via teletzke s method begin to merge with our curve .",

    "solid line represents our data obtained via a perturbation analysis .",
    "points are data obtained via teletzke s method @xcite.,width=480 ]    in this section , we completed the previously unstudied part of the finite plug speed problem . together with teletzke s method , we can now predict how fast plugs of different length will move in smooth cylindrical tubes .",
    "evidently the speed dependence on the plug length is governed by the solution modes @xmath76 in the thin film region . for long plugs studied in this section , their speeds are the most sensitive to the mode with the longest wavelength : @xmath77 . in smooth tubes ,",
    "this @xmath78 is much smaller than the tube radius @xmath1 for small capillary numbers of interest .",
    "the asymptotic corrections of the finite plug speed is exponentially weak , with a decay length @xmath78 .",
    "for very long plugs with @xmath79 , the speed is almost the same as that of the semi - infinite one .",
    "as discussed in the next section , tube roughness can modify the spectrum of solution modes in the thin film region dramatically so that @xmath78 may become comparable to or larger than @xmath1 .",
    "this is crucial in understanding some interesting experimental phenomena involving the relative motion between finite plugs of different length in non - smooth capillary tubes .",
    "in this section , we investigate the shape of the thin film region of semi - infinite plugs in tubes with roughness . here",
    "tube roughness is defined as surface deformation of the tube wall , whose shape is not cylindrical . for simplicity , the only type of roughness that we will consider in the following discussion is azimuthal roughness . a tube with the azimuthal roughness preserves its translation symmetry in the axial direction , but cross sections are no longer circular .",
    "a sketch of such a tube is plotted in fig.[fig:2:roughness](a ) .",
    "the cross section of the rough tube is parameterized in the polar coordinate system as : @xmath80 , where @xmath1 is the smooth tube radius and @xmath4 is the polar angle .",

    "@xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is some small parameter much less than the bretherton s thin film thickness @xmath18 , and @xmath83 is a function of order unity .",
    "the tube roughness breaks rotational symmetry in the azimuthal plane . as a result ,",
    "the plug shape now depends on both the @xmath59 and the @xmath4 coordinate : @xmath84 .",
    "local lubricating film thickness is defined by the distance between the tube wall and the plug surface : @xmath85 , as shown in fig.[fig:2:roughness](b ) . as in the previous section ,",
    "we nondimensionalize the system by using the smooth tube radius @xmath1 , the plug speed @xmath13 and the capillary pressure @xmath28 .",
    "as derived later in this section , the semi - infinite plug shape in the thin film region can be expressed as : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are eigenfunctions and eigenvalues governing the relaxation of the plug shape to the cylindrical asymptote @xmath89 .",
    "relaxation mode coefficients @xmath90 are determined by boundary conditions away from the thin film region . in section 4",
    ", we will estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath90 near the transition between the thin film and the remobilization region .",
    "+      as in the case of the smooth tube , the plug shape is dictated by the local carrier fluid flux @xmath91 : @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the carrier fluid velocity .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig:2:roughness](b ) , @xmath94 has both an axial component @xmath95 and an azimuthal component @xmath96 . in the limit of lubrication approximation , and with the same boundary conditions as in the smooth case ,",

    "afm measurements on these tubes show roughness with @xmath116 of order @xmath258 and amplitude of order 50 nanometers .",
    "this amplitude is evidently large on the scale of interest .",
    "since the roughness varies randomly along the tube , one expects statistical fluctuations in the speed @xmath13 along the tube .",
    "some of these fluctuations can be due to differences in cross sectional area , so that they cause the fluid speed @xmath14 to change with position .",

    "<S> we first derive the asymptotic dependence of the plug speed on the finite length in the smooth tube case . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence on length is exponentially small , with a decay length much shorter than the tube radius @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> then we discuss the effect of azimuthal roughness of the tube on the plug speed . </S>",
    "<S> the tube roughness leads to an unbalanced capillary pressure and a carrier fluid flux in the azimuthal plane . </S>",
    "<S> this flux controls the relaxation of the plug shape to its infinite - length limit . for long - wavelength roughness </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the above decay length is much longer in the rough tube , and even becomes comparable to the tube radius @xmath1 in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a much - enhanced dependence of the plug speed on the plug length . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism may explain the catch - up effect seen experimentally @xcite .    </S>",
