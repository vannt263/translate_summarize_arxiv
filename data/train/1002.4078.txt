    "a dissipation is normally adopted to handle discontinuities in non viscous flows ( the riemann problem ) .",
    "such a dissipation can be either explicit ( artificial viscosity ) or implicit , being intrinsic within the adopted algorithm ( e.g. godunov - like methods ) .",
    "an artificial viscosity is introduced in sph , as a shock capturing method , to prevent particle interpenetration and to smooth out spurious heating in the solution of strictly hyperbolic system of euler equations .",
    "such a small dissipation also produces both mass and angular momentum transport in sph physically inviscid modelling of accretion discs @xcite .",
    "efforts were accomplished in sph to solve both the `` approximate '' and the `` exact '' riemann problem , either via an explicit reformulation of the artificial viscosity term @xcite or via sophisticated godunov algorithms @xcite . a physical way to solve the riemann problem , based on a reformulation of the eos in the euler equations ,",
    "is here presented , where particle sph pressure terms are recalculated without any artificial viscosity contribution . since shock flows are non equilibrium events , we pay attention to the fact that the eos : @xmath0 for ideal flows can not exactly be applied to solve flow discontinuities .",
    "applications of the reformulated eos to 1d shock tubes @xcite , to solve shocks are shown , as well as a comparison to models adopting a different dissipation is given for the coming out of spiral patterns in accretion discs in cbs .",
    "in the lagrangian ideal non - viscous gas hydrodynamics , the relevant equations ( euler equations ) are :    @xmath1    the most of the adopted symbols have the usual meaning : @xmath2 stands for the lagrangian derivative , @xmath3 is the gas density , @xmath4 is the thermal energy per unit mass .",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath5 has the meaning of a numerical parameter whose value lies in the range between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in principle .",
    "the sph method is a free lagrangian scheme that discretizes the fluid into moving interacting and interpolating domains called `` particles '' .",
    "all particles move according to pressure and body forces .",
    "the method makes use of a kernel @xmath8 useful to interpolate a physical quantity @xmath9 related to a gas particle at position @xmath10 according to @xcite :    @xmath11    @xmath12 , the interpolation kernel , is a continuous function - or two connecting continuous functions whose derivatives are continuous even at the connecting point - defined in the spatial range @xmath13 , whose limit for @xmath14 is the dirac delta distribution function .",
    "all physical quantities are described as extensive properties smoothly distributed in space and computed by interpolation at @xmath10 . in sph terms",
    "the sum is extended to all particles included within the interpolation domain @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the number density relative to the @xmath17 particle .",
    "@xmath18 is the adopted interpolation kernel whose value is determined by the relative distance between particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in sph formalism , equations ( 2 ) and",
    "( 3 ) take the form , respectively :    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the mass of @xmath17 particle .    for a better energy conservation , the total energy @xmath25",
    "can also be introduced in the sph formulation :    @xmath26    of the energy equation : @xmath27 .    in this scheme",
    "the continuity equation takes the form :    @xmath28    or , as we adopt , it can be written as : @xmath29 , which identifies the natural space interpolation of particle densities according to equation ( 6 ) .",
    "the pressure terms @xmath30 include the artificial viscosity contribution given by @xcite and @xcite , with an appropriate thermal diffusion term which reduces shock fluctuations : @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is given by :    @xmath33    with @xmath34 being the sound speed of the @xmath35 particle , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these @xmath40 and @xmath41 parameters of the order of the unity are usually adopted @xcite to damp oscillations past high mach number shock fronts developed by non - linear instabilities @xcite .",
    "the linear @xmath40 term is based on the viscosity of a gas .",
    "the quadratic ( @xmath41 , von neumann - richtmyer - like ) artificial viscosity term is necessary to handle strong shocks .",
    "linear @xmath40 and quadratic @xmath41 artificial viscosity terms are @xmath42",
    ". a reformulation of the artificial viscosity could be even necessary because , for `` weak shocks '' or low mach numbers , the fluid becomes `` too viscous '' and angular momentum and vorticity could be non - physically transferred .",
    "@xcite developed some effective techniques to get a limitation of the effectiveness of the artificial viscosity , while @xcite derived a new formulation for artificial viscosity conceptually based on the riemann problem .",
    "the solution of the riemann problem in sph is also obtained at the interparticle contact points among particles , where a pressure and a velocity , relative to the flow discontinuity , are computed .",
    "this is also clearly shown in @xcite , where the new pressure @xmath30 and velocity @xmath43 are reintroduced in the euler equations to obtain the new solutions compatible with inviscid flow discontinuities . in sph , we pay attention in particular @xcite to the particle pressures @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in the sph formulation of the momentum and energy equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 or 9 ) , whose substitution with pressures , solutions of the riemann problem , excludes any artificial viscosity adoption , although a dissipation is necessarily implicitly introduced @xcite .",
    "the classical eos for a perfect gas : @xmath0 is strictly applied in fluid dynamics when the gas components do not collide with each other whenever a thermal equilibrium exists .",
    "it modifies in : @xmath46 other in the case of gas collisions .",
    "the further term takes into account the velocity of perturbation propagation @xcite .",
    "this velocity equals the ideal gas sound velocity @xmath47 whenever we treat static gases or in the case of rarefaction waves .",
    "instead , it includes the `` compression velocity '' : @xmath48 in the case of shocks ( @xmath49 ; @xcite ) . in the first case , we write the eos for inviscid ideal gases as : @xmath50 , where @xmath51^{1/2}$ ] . in the second case ,",
    "the new formulation for the eos is obtained squaring @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 is an energy per unit mass in the case of shock . hence :    @xmath54    in the sph scheme , being :    @xmath55    this formulation introduces the `` shock pressure term '' @xmath56 , whose dependence on linear and quadratic power on @xmath48 is analogue to both the linear and the quadratic components of the artificial viscosity term ( eq .",
    "the linear term in @xmath48 is based on the viscosity of a gas .",
    "the quadratic term in @xmath48 ( von neumann - richtmyer - like ) is necessary to handle strong shocks .",
    "these contributions involve a dissipative power , whose effect correspond to an increase of the gas pressure .",
    "therefore , we adopt the formulation ( eq .",
    "13 ) as @xmath57 in the sph formulation of the momentum ( eq . 8) and",
    "energy equations ( eqs . 9 or 10 ) :    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    however , to give a generalization , we need only one general eos and not a separation of the eos according to the kinematic of the flow . to this purpose",
    ", we can generalize the eos : @xmath61 as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 for @xmath64 , whilst @xmath65 otherwise",
    ". a simple empirical formulation can be : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is a large number describing how much the flow description corresponds to that of an ideal gas . to this purpose , @xmath69 ,",
    "being @xmath70 the molecular mean free path , and @xmath71 the mean linear dimension of gas molecules .",
    "a comparison of analytical and our sph - riemann 1d shock tube test results ( sod 1978 ) , also with the initial particle configuration ( time @xmath72 ) , is made .",
    "1 and 2 shows results concerning the particle density , thermal energy per unit mass and velocity at the same final computational time ( @xmath73 ) . throughout our sph - riemann simulations ,",
    "the initial particle resolution length is @xmath74 .",
    "the whole computational domain is built up with @xmath75 particles from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , whose mass is different , according to the shock initial position . at time @xmath72 all particles are motionless .",
    "@xmath78 , while the ratios @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( fig . 1 - left side ) , and @xmath79 and @xmath81 ( fig . 1 - right side ) , between the two sides left - right .",
    "the first and the last @xmath82 particles of the 1d computational domain , keep fixed positions and do not move .",
    "discrepancies involve only @xmath83 particles at most .",
    "this means that the physical dissipation introduced in the eos ( eq .",
    "13 ) is effective .",
    "results on 3d sph simulations of accretion disc structure and dynamics in a cb are shown as far as the coming out of spiral patterns and shocks in the radial flow are concerned .",
    "the resolution length of sph particles is @xmath84 , being @xmath6 the non - dimensional separation @xmath85 of the two stars .",
    "the injection of particles from the inner lagrangian point l1 is supersonic : @xmath86 , whilst the temperature of gas coming from the secondary star is @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the compact primary is a @xmath89 star , while the donor companion is a @xmath90 star . the comparison with other different sph techniques ( see fig",
    ". 2 caption ) , where artificial dissipation is explicitly introduced , shows that the coming out of spirals , as well as other disc geometric details , are much better evidenced in those simulations where the eos and related dissipation are treated in their full physical sense .",
    "3d accretion disc simulations clearly show different results .",
    "the adoption of a supersonic injection kinematics from l1 is justified in terms both of conservation of the flux momentum and in terms of the jacobi constant and in terms of the bernoulli s theorem @xcite .",
    "this kinematics concern active phases of accretion discs where both radial disc increases and spiral structures develop .",
    "causes generating spiral patterns and disc geometric details are deeply discussed in @xcite as a consequence of external perturbations as tidal torques as well as the collisional impact of the injected flow onto the disc s outer edge .",
    "hence , the 3d simulated structure better corresponding to such theoretical and observational constraints is that produced according to the formalism here proposed ( model d ) .",
    "the typical 3d sph disc structure ( model a ) does not fully correspond to these characteristics , while other 3d disc models lack of several features .",
