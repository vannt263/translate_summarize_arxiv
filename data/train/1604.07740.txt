    "the standard model ( sm ) in particle physics is in good agreement with the majority of the experimental data .",
    "however it does not explain some fundamental issues , e.g. , the large number of the  elementary \" fermions , and their arbitrary masses and mixings , fractional electric charge of the quarks , similarity between the leptons and the quarks ( analogous three flavors , and similar behavior under the @xmath1 symmetry with the same weak coupling ) , etc .",
    "the models of compositeness  @xcite try to solve these problems by introducing the substructure of the sm particles .",
    "theories with a colored substructure of the leptons besides frequently discussed @xmath2 triplet leptoquarks ( lqs ) and octet leptogluons may include also @xmath2 singlet excited leptons , which have larger masses , but same lepton numbers as the sm leptons .",
    "so the leptons can be `` excited '' to these new heavy states by the interactions with other sm particles .",
    "a particular type of the excited leptons present a hypothetical fermion that effectively couples to lepton and the pair of the sm fermion and antifermion .",
    "this coupling conserves the baryon number ( @xmath3 ) and does not spoil the stability of the proton .",
    "we refer to the excited lepton of discussed type as leptomeson ( lm ) . and @xmath4 . ] in particular",
    ", lms may have the same preon content as lepton - meson pairs .",
    "one example of lm generation can be given in the haplon models  @xcite , which are based on the symmetry @xmath5 , and contain the two cathegories of colored preons ( haplons ) : the fermions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the scalars @xmath8 , @xmath9 ,    in this framework the preon pairs can compose the sm particles as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc . , and the new heavy composites , e.g. , lq @xmath13 and leptogluon @xmath14 , where the subindex indicates @xmath15 representation .",
    "however there can exist also multipreon lm states such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .",
    "this possibility gets more points from recent discoveries of the multiquark states  @xcite due to the similarity between qcd and haplon dynamics .",
    "essentially , lms can be lighter than the lqs and the leptogluons due to the absence of color dressing .",
    "notice that possible contribution to the muon @xmath0 from a particular type of lms , which can couple to a lepton and a meson , was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the most important observations , which can not be explained within the big bang cosmology and the sm , is the baryon asymmetry ( @xmath18 ) of the universe that appears to be populated exclusively with baryonic matter rather than antibaryonic matter  @xcite .",
    "possible scenarios of dynamical generation of @xmath18 during the evolution of the universe from a hot early matter - antimatter symmetric stage are known as the baryogenesis ( bg ) mechanisms .",
    "majority of these scenarios discussed in the literature satisfy the three sakharov conditions  @xcite :    * violation of @xmath3 symmetry ; * violation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 symmetries ( to produce an excess of baryons over antibaryons ) ; * a departure from thermal equilibrium ( since the average of @xmath3 is zero in equilibrium ) .    some  exotic \" mechanisms of bg that do not satisfy at least one of these conditions were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sm does not provide a successful bg due to the lack of @xmath20 violation and not strongly first order electroweak phase transition ( pt )  @xcite to achieve the departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "though in the economical sm extensions @xmath18 can be generated through the thermal leptogenesis ( lg ) mechanism  @xcite where the @xmath21 asymmetry is produced in the out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy majorana particles , and further the sm sphaleron processes  @xcite convert this lepton asymmetry into the baryon one .",
    "these sphaleron transitions are effective until the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "however lg in the supersymmetric generalizations of the sm suffers from the gravitino problem  @xcite , which comes from the too high reheating temperature related to the strong lower bound on the right - handed neutrino mass ( davidson - ibarra bound )  @xcite",
    ". to avoid this problem the resonant mechanisms of lg were introduced  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how lms may provide successful bg .",
    "the deviation from thermal equilibrium can occur during production ( so - called bg from oscillations )  @xcite as well as during freeze - out and decay  @xcite . depending on the properties of lms either one of these two scenarios",
    "can be realized in the nature .",
    "the former case can work for both dirac and majorana lm masses , and is of particular interest since it can be successful with the lm masses of order of ewsb scale that can be tested nowadays .",
    "the later case requires majorana masses of lms similarly to the standard lg  @xcite from @xmath22 singlet neutrino decays .",
    "however the important difference is that the davidson - ibarra bound on the heavy neutrino masses , which comes from their see - saw connection to the light neutrino masses through the yukawa couplings , is not applicable to the considered lm masses . in result",
    ", the lm masses are allowed to be much smaller than permitted heavy neutrino mass scale of @xmath23  gev in the standard lg .    in the flowchart for the bg models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] the relevant to present consideration ways to satisfy the sakharov conditions are emphasized by the bold arrows and the related blocks are encircled by the dashed line .",

    "consider neutral long - living lms that interact with the sm leptons and quarks at the energies below the new physics scale @xmath24 ( e.g. , the compositeness scale ) dominantly through the effective four - fermion terms , unlike the ordinary sterile neutrinos with their essential yukawa couplings to the leptons and the higgs doublet .",
    "for the vector case with lepton flavor and @xmath3 conservation ( and lepton number @xmath21 conservation for the dirac lms ) these four - fermion interactions at the first order in lm fields can be written as @xmath25      + \\text{h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the effective couplings ( real couplings can work for the bg in this section ) , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the sm lepton , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote either two quarks or two leptons ( we take them from the same particle generation ) such that the sum of the electric charges of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is zero , and @xmath35 is the neutral lm flavor state that is related to the mass eigenstates @xmath36 by the mixing matrix @xmath37 as @xmath38    lms can be produced thermally from the primordial plasma . once created @xmath35 oscillate and interact with ordinary matter .",
    "these processes do not violate the total lepton number @xmath39 , defined as usual lepton number plus that of lms .",
    "however the oscillations of lms violate @xmath20 and therefore their individual lepton numbers are not conserved .- violating scatterings can significantly effect the picture similarly to the case of sterile neutrinos  @xcite . ]",
    "hence the initial state with all zero lepton numbers evolves into a state with @xmath40 but nonzero individual lepton numbers of lms .    at the temperatures below @xmath24 scale lms",
    "communicate their lepton asymmetry to the neutrinos and the charged leptons through the effective four - fermion interactions in eq .  .",
    "suppose that the neutral lms of at least one type remain in thermal equilibrium until the time of ewsb @xmath41 at which sphalerons become ineffective , and those of at least one other type come out - of - equilibrium by @xmath41 .",
    "hence the lepton number of the former ( later ) affects ( has no effect on ) the baryogenesis . in result ,",
    "the final baryon asymmetry after @xmath41 is nonzero . at the time @xmath42 all lms decay into the leptons and the quarks ( hadrons ) .",
    "for this reason they do not contribute to the dark matter in the universe , and do not destroy the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the system of @xmath43 types of singlet lms with a given momentum @xmath44 that interact with the primordial plasma can be described by the @xmath45 density matrix @xmath46 . in a simplified picture",
    "this matrix satisfies the kinetic equation  @xcite @xmath47 - \\frac{i}{2}\\{\\gamma,\\rho\\ } + \\frac{i}{2}\\{\\gamma^p,1-\\rho\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the destruction ( production ) rate , and the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the matrix of the squared lm mass eigenstates , and @xmath52 is a real potential .",
    "( in the approximation of boltzmann statistics the last term in eq .   is @xmath53 . ) in general , evolution of lms can be considered together with the evolution of the sm leptons using the methods of refs .",
    "however such precise numerical analysis is beyond the scope of present consideration . in the following we concentrate on the essentially different temperature dependence of the interaction rate for lms and the sterile neutrinos , which makes the lm scenario more attractive for the experimentalists .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath54 reactions that contribute to the lm destruction rate can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the four interacting particles ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath58 and @xmath35 ) , @xmath59 is the constant that includes the color factor in the case of the interaction with quarks , @xmath60 is the total energy of the process , and @xmath26 is the relevant coupling from eq .  .",
    "in the considered lm scenario the cross section in eq .   is proportional to @xmath60 in contrast to the inverse proportionality in the case of bg from neutrino oscillations .",
    "the respective @xmath54 scattering rate density at the hight temperatures @xmath61 can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of internal degrees of freedom of the particle @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the bessel function .",
    "then the interaction rate that equilibrates lms ( average destruction rate ) can be estimated as @xmath66    the conditions that lms of type @xmath67 remain in thermal equilibrium till the time of the ewsb @xmath41 , while lms of type @xmath68 do not , are @xmath69 where the hubble expansion rate @xmath70 can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 gev is the planck mass , and @xmath73 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the primordial plasma .",
    "remarkably , the rates in eqs .   and are suppressed by the forth power of @xmath74 ratio with respect to the case of the bg via the sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "for this reason , the couplings @xmath26 can be significantly larger than the yukawa couplings of that sterile neutrinos .",
    "in particular , for @xmath75  tev we have @xmath76 .",

    "<S> various new physics models , e.g. , theories of compositeness , can accommodate the color singlet excited leptons that interact with the leptons , quarks , leptoquarks , etc . a particular type of excited lepton , which at low energies interacts with the standard model fermions mainly through the four - fermion coupling to lepton and quark - antiquark ( or lepton - antilepton ) pair , we call leptomeson . these new particles may contribute to variety of the experimental anomalies such as the discrepancy in the muon @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the leptomesons can generate also the baryon asymmetry that explains the imbalance in ordinary matter and antimatter in the observable universe . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the two types of scenarios for this baryogenesis via leptogenesis to occur from either leptomeson oscillations or decays . </S>",
    "<S> both possibilities do not contradict to the small masses of the observable neutrinos and the proton stability . </S>",
    "<S> moreover they can be relevant for the near future collider experiments and do not suffer from the gravitino problem . </S>"
