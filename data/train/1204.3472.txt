    "the ngc  1023 group is one of the most extensively systems studied ( 300 related references are listed in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) .",
    "the first large scale study of it has been performed by @xcite .",
    "later on the presence of several outstanding dwarf galaxies drew the attention of @xcite who studied in detail four of them in the optical bands .",
    "the most peculiar feature of ngc  1023 is its proximity to the ( likely tidally interacting ) fainter galaxy ngc  1023a .",
    "the latter galaxy appears as a small companion located at the east end of ngc 1023 .",
    "it appears as a low - luminosity condensation partially embedded in the disc of the larger galaxy .",
    "this configuration gives the appearance of an asymmetric spiral arm and led @xcite to include the two galaxies in his atlas of peculiar galaxies as arp 135 .",
    "only later @xcite proposed ngc  1023a to be an interacting individual galaxy stressing also its coincidence with a cloud of a neutral hydrogen ( hi ) identified by @xcite .",
    "additional , more recent hi observations confirming the sancisi s results ( presence of tails and bridges ) has been performed by morganti et al .",
    "the separation ( and different stellar population ) of the two objects is assured today also by the uv images of the galex satellite ( morrissey et al .",
    "in particular ngc  1023a appears to be an irregular galaxy close to the sb0 ngc  1023 .",
    "moreover the surface brightness , fuv and nuv galex profiles of ngc  1023 are included in the ultraviolet atlas of nearby galaxies of gil de paz et al . ( 2007 ) .",
    "current programs ( e.g. trentham & tully 2009 ) are intended to explore the ngc  1023 environment in order to detect the faintest candidate dwarfs ( and establish their possible membership to the group ) ; the outcome of such research could indeed help to clarify , for instance , the so called fundamental missing satellite problem .",
    "moreover ngc  1023 looks to be the first known s0 for which a proper kinematical approach based on pne ( cortesi et al .",
    "2011 ) has shown that it likely originates from the secular evolution of a parent spiral galaxy instead of a more disruptive fast merger .    in this paper",
    "we analyze uv data in the central region of the group and we use them to characterize its core with sph simulations .",
    "these are used also to investigate the dark matter distribution in the group environment as not confined in the haloes of the single galaxies .",
    "the work is structured as follows : section  2 gives a detailed description of the dominant galaxy , ngc  1023 , while section  3 provides an exhaustive description of the uv photometric analysis of both ngc  1023 and ngc  1023a .",
    "the adopted sph modeling is described in section  4 .",
    "the conclusions are finally listed in section  5 .",
    "ngc  1023 is an almost edge - on lenticular galaxy , classified as sb0 by most catalogues ( e.g. rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , at an estimated distance of 11.4  mpc ( tonry et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it belongs to a sparse group , rich in spirals , and is the brightest member of the lgg 70 group ( garcia 1993 ) . in the optical images ( the carnegie atlas 1994 ) the galaxy appears to be composed of a faint stellar disk , a inner and brighter lens and a bar at @xmath045@xmath1 from the apparent disk major axis .",
    "a central nuclear disk is also present , with relatively young stars ( cf .",

    "2011 , their table 1 ) derive a velocity dispersion of 210km / s and a stellar age of 4.7 gyr .",
    "the redshift difference with the companion ngc  1023a is @xmath2v=127@xmath330 km s@xmath4 ( capaccioli et al .",
    "1986 ) and the projected distance @xmath07.6  kpc ( barbon & capaccioli 1975 ; adopted h@xmath5 = 75 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) . in bluer and deeper images the smaller galaxy exhibits some luminous knots that are consistent with a late - type dwarf galaxy .",
    "we used fuv and nuv background - subtracted , de - archived intensity images from the galex pipeline . in order to estimate the uncertainties of uv ( ab ) magnitudes , we propagated poisson statistical errors on source and background counts .",
    "in addition to the statistical error , we added an uncertainty to account for systematic inaccuracies in the zero - point of the absolute calibration of 0.05 and 0.03 mag for fuv and nuv respectively ( morrissey et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "fuv and nuv magnitudes have been computed as @xmath6 where cr is the dead - time corrected , flat fielded count rate , and the zero points are zp=18.82 and zp=20.08 in fuv and nuv respectively ( morrissey et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we corrected uv magnitudes by adopting a foreground reddening from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for both ngc  1023 and ngc  1023a , namely e(b - v)=0.061 . with reference to the extinction curve of savage & mathis ( 1979 )",
    ", this translates into the extinction values a@xmath7=0.56 and a@xmath8=0.49 respectively , adopting @xmath9=2267     and 1516    for the two above filters .    for our study",
    ", first we derive the photometic parameters of ngc 1023 and ngc 1023a and as a second step we cross - correlate the @xcite sample of objects with the galex photometric catalogue .",
    "we found 9 matches ( together with ngc 1023 and ngc 1023a ) over 28 objects .",
    "all the galaxies with know redshift are detected in uv bands while only two ( namely ngc1023 - 15 and ngc1023 - 17 ) of the dwarfs listed in @xcite have uv emission .",
    "in addition to these galaxies we discovered two new objects , identified as c1 and c2 .",

    "integrated photometric properties are given in table [ tab : fos_indb ] while photometric parameters for the fits are listed in table [ re ] .",

    "the inner regions of the profiles , affected by the galex psf ( @xmath0 5@xmath13 ) , were excluded in performing interpolation .",
    "the lens and bar are not visible in uv images and the ellipse interpolations find constant ellipticity and p.a . values .",

    "the values of the bulge effective radii in fuv and nuv reported in table [ tab : fos_indb ] are quite similar and are in agreement with those found by optical photometry in r band , reported in the work of @xcite : r@xmath15=32 `` .",

    "contrary to what observed in ngc 1023 the color profile in ngc 1023a is constant around a value @xmath00.8 .",

    "+ such a relation holds for a sapleter s imf with lower and upper mass limits 0.1m@xmath18 and 100m@xmath18 respectively .",
    "we used our total fuv magnitudes to derive the sfrs which are given in table [ tab : fos_indb ] . using the previous equation we found that the sfr is not null in ngc 1023 although it provides very low values ( 2.68@xmath21m@xmath18 yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "the spitzer data for the inner regions of this galaxy @xcite indicate no signature of sf .",
    "the sfr in the other dwarf galaxies and in the two blobs ( c1 and c2 ) is even lower , with the lowest value , 0.01@xmath21m@xmath18 yr@xmath4 , for ugc 2165 .",
    "however their colors ( see fig . [ colori ] ) are bluer than those of the two brighter galaxies of the group .",
    "with the aim to match the overall seds and the global properties of ngc1023 and ngc1203a in a consistent way with the dynamical properties of the group , we select , from a large set of sph simulations , one case which gives us insights into the evolution of such a system and the group itself .",
    "our sph simulations of galaxy formation and evolution are starting from the same initial conditions as described in @xcite ( mc03 in the following ) and @xcite i.e. , collapsing triaxial systems initially composed of dark matter ( dm ) and gas in different proportions and different total masses .",
    "all the simulations include self  gravity of gas , stars and dm , radiative cooling , hydrodynamical pressure , shock heating , artificial viscosity , star formation ( sf ) and feedback from evolved stars and type ii sne , and chemical enrichment as in mc03 ( and references therein ) .",
    "they provide the synthetic sed at each evolutionary step .",
    "the sed accounted for chemical evolution , stellar emission , internal extinction and re - emission by dust in a self - consistent way , as described in @xcite and @xcite ; this extends over four order of magnitude in wavelength , i.e. , from 0.1 to 1000 @xmath22 m .",
    "so , each simulation self - consistently provides dynamic , morphological , and chemo - photometric evolution .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) is of salpeter type with upper mass limit 100@xmath23 and lower mass limit 0.01@xmath23 ( salpeter , 1955 ) ( see @xcite and mc03 for a discussion ) .",
    "all the model parameters here adopted had been tuned in previous papers where the integrated properties of simulated galaxies , i.e. , colors , absolute magnitudes , mass to luminosity ratios provided by different choices of model parameters after 15 gyr , had been successfully compared with those of local galaxies ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , the imf choice here provides a slightly higher sfr compared with the other possibilities examined , allows for the lowest feedback strength , and the expected rotational support when disk galaxies are formed .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by @xcite , its slope is almost the same as the universal mass function which links imf of galaxies and stars to those of brown dwarfs , planets and small bodies ( meteoroids , asteroids ) @xcite . with respect to mc03 , the initial particle resolution here",
    "is enhanced to more than 6@xmath1910@xmath24 ( see below ) instead of 2@xmath1910@xmath24 , and the time separation between the snapshots halved , 151myr .",
    "a new large set of galaxy encounters involving systems with 1:1 mass ratios and different mass ratios have been performed with the same initial conditions as described in mc03 ( and references therein ) . by seeking to exploit a vast range of orbital parameters",
    ", we carried out different simulations for each couple of interacting systems varying the orbital initial conditions in order to have , for the ideal keplerian orbit of two mass points of mass equal to 10@xmath25 , or 10@xmath26 , the first peri - center separation , p , equal to the initial length of the major axis of the dm triaxial halo , i.e. 88 kpc for 10@xmath27 , or equal to 1/10 , 1/5 , and 1/3 of the same axis for 10@xmath26 encounters .",
    "for each of these separations , we changed the eccentricity in order to have hyperbolic orbits of different energy .",
    "the spins of the systems are equal ( mc03 ) , generally parallel each other , and perpendicular to the orbital plane , so we studied direct encounters .",
    "however , some cases with misaligned spins have been also analyzed in order to deepen the effects of the system initial rotation on the results .",
    "moreover , for a given set of encounters with the same orbital parameters we also examined the role of increasing initial gas fractions .",
    "all these new simulations will be fully discussed elsewhere ( mazzei , in prep ) .",
    "a simulation able to match the global properties of ngc  1023 is chosen and discussed below .",
    "all the observables , i.e. absolute magnitudes , colors , which correspond to the sed over almost four order of magnitude in wavelength , and mass - to - light luminosity ratios are self - consistently derived from our simulation at the snapshot selected , and successfully compared with the available data .",

    "so , the starting point is given by two triaxial collapsing systems with total mass 1.2@xmath1910@xmath28 m@xmath18 , and 60 times less of gas , i.e. 2@xmath1910@xmath29 m@xmath18 .",
    "the mass particle resolution is 5@xmath1910@xmath30 m@xmath18 for gas and 4.95@xmath1910@xmath31 m@xmath18 for dm particles .",
