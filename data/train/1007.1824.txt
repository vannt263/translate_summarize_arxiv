    "recently , hoava has put forward a renormalizable theory of gravity when the scaling dimensions of space and time are different , which is called hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity @xcite .",

    "subsequently , there have been extensive studies for the hl gravity @xcite , such that various black holes  @xcite and cosmological solutions @xcite have been intensively studied .",
    "moreover , it has been claimed that the nonisotropic scaling of spacetime related to the foliation preserving diffeomorphism ( fpd ) gives a modified dispersion relation @xcite .",
    "as for the nonisotropic scaling , even in a flat spacetime , it generically leads to an intriguing dispersion relation of the form , @xmath5 = m^2 c^4 $ ] , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the speed of light , the mass of a particle , and a parameter , respectively  @xcite .",
    "of course , it can be generalized in non - flat spacetimes .",
    "there have been some studies for modified dispersion relations in black hole physics , similarly to this dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been known that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon . for calculating the statistical entropy ,",
    "the brick - wall method suggested by t hooft can be used  @xcite , where the cutoff parameter should be introduced to handle the divergence near the event horizon .",
    "since degrees of freedom of a field are dominant near the horizon , the brick wall can be replaced by a thin layer or a thin spherical box  @xcite . by the way , the cutoff parameter located just outside the horizon can be avoided if we consider the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite .",
    "actually , the mode counting can be done from the horizon to the minimal length and it gives finite density because of the modification of phase space volume and the dispersion relation .",
    "in this paper , we would like to study the statistical entropy of spherically symmetric black holes in the hl gravity using the ( thin - layered ) brick wall method .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce a lifshitz scalar field rather than the usual scalar field to incorporate the nonisotropic symmetry up to the matter sector . in this semi - classical calculation",
    ", the resulting entropy shows that for @xmath9 corresponding to the super renormalizable case of hl gravity , the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff parameter can be avoided , so that a thin layer can be located just outside the horizon similarly to the case of gup . assuming the bekenstein - hawking entropy which is proportional to the area of horizon",

    "we briefly review hl gravity in a self - contained manner , and introduce black hole solutions for ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hl gravity . on general grounds , as like the adm decomposition of the metric in einstein gravity , the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional metric can be decomposed into @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the usual lapse and shift functions .",

    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ thickness ] ) , it amounts the highly super - renormalizable case of hl gravity @xmath192 .",
    "it implies that the lifshitz scalar field may play a role of the usual scalar field along with gup at least in the brick wall regime .",
    "unfortunately , it is unclear why the scaling parameter should be so large if we try to match the minimal length in gup and @xmath193 .",
