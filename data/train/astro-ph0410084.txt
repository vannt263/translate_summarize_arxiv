    "the stellar mass of galaxies at the present epoch and the build - up of stellar mass over cosmic time has become the focus of intense research in the past few years .    in the local universe ,",
    "results on the stellar mass function of galaxies were published using the new generation of wide - angle surveys in the optical ( sloan digital sky survey ; sdss , @xcite ; 2df , e.g.  @xcite ) and near - infrared ( two micron all sky survey ; 2mass , @xcite ) . @xcite combined data from 2mass and 2df to derive the local stellar mass function , @xcite used the sdss and 2mass to the same end .    at @xmath3 ,",
    "a number of authors studied the stellar mass density as a function of redshift @xcite reaching @xmath4 , while others , using wider field surveys , investigated the evolution of the mass function of galaxies @xcite to @xmath5 .",
    "generally , the high - redshift work relies on fits of multi - color photometry to a grid of composite stellar population ( csp ) models to determine a stellar mass - to - light ratio , since large and complete spectroscopic samples of galaxies are not yet available .",
    "a similar approach was chosen by @xcite and @xcite , too , at @xmath6 .    taking advantage of the availability of photometry and spectroscopy for galaxies in the sdss , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k03 hereafter ) utilized spectroscopic diagnostics ( 4000  break , d@xmath74000 , and the h@xmath8   balmer absorption line index ) to estimate the mean stellar age and the fraction of stars formed in recent bursts in each galaxy . by comparison of the colors predicted by their best - fit model to the object",
    "s broad - band photometry they determine the amount of extinction by dust and hence the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to compare the stellar masses determined by this spectroscopic technique to masses obtained from multi - passband photometry and to compare both methods to a simple dynamical estimate of mass .",
    "knowing that none of these methods yields a fiducial ( stellar ) mass , a comparison helps to establish the ( relative ) reliability of each method and makes us aware of potential differences between these estimators .",
    "moreover , it can show us whether one can use observationally cheaper estimators as surrogates for more expensive ( or unobtainable ) ones , which is particularly important when dealing with high - redshift datasets .",
    "specifically , we want to know how the two estimators compare to each other , if using k - band @xmath9  yields better masses than using the g - band @xmath9  which is accessible at high @xmath10 , and how these compare to a simple dynamical mass estimator , @xmath11 .",
    "this letter is laid out as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : galaxy - sample ] we describe the sample of galaxies we use in this work . in sect .",
    "[ sec : deriving - masses ] we give a brief overview of how we derive stellar masses by fitting csp models to multi - band photometry . in sect .",
    "[ sec : stellmass ] we compare these masses to the values in k03 and in sect .  [ sec : dynmass ] to a simple dynamical estimate of mass based on the sdss velocity dispersions .",
    "we also discuss the implications of these comparisons .",
    "we assume @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 throughout this work .",
    "the sample of galaxies we use in this work is selected from the nyu value - added galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "this is a merged catalog of objects from the sdss data release two ( dr2 ) and 2mass point - source and extended - source catalogs ( and other catalogs which are not relevant here , as well ) .",
    "we select all objects classified as galaxies and having a secure redshift measurement in the sdss and that are detected in the 2mass catalogs . from this set",
    "we randomly sub - select 20% of the objects leaving us with a sample of sample of @xmath15 objects having redshifts and photometry in ugrizjhk .",
    "we cross - correlate this catalog with the data from k03 to obtain their stellar mass estimates .",
    "the galaxies in the sample span the absolute magnitude range @xmath16 , the restframe @xmath17 color range @xmath18 , and the ( stellar ) mass range @xmath19 .",
    "the method we use to infer stellar masses from multi - color photometry is an advancement of the program used in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the comparison of multi - color photometry to a grid of stellar population synthesis models covering a wide range in parameters , especially star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "we base our new model grid on the @xcite stellar population synthesis package .",
    "we parameterize the possible sfhs by a two - component model , consisting of a main component with a smooth analytically described sfh and a burst of star formation .",
    "the main component is parameterized by a star formation rate of the form @xmath20 , with @xmath21 $ ]  gyr and a metallicity of @xmath22 } < 0.3 $ ] .",
    "the age , @xmath23 , is allowed to vary between 0.5  gyr and the age of the universe ( at the object s redshift ) .",
    "the smooth component is linearly combined with a burst of star formation , which is modeled as a 100  myr old constant star formation rate episode of solar metallicity .",
    "we restrict the burst fraction , @xmath24 , to the range @xmath25 in mass ( higher values of @xmath24 are degenerate and unnecessary since this case is covered by models with a young main component ) .",
    "we adopt a salpeter initial mass function for both components , with lower and upper mass cutoffs of 0.1 and 100  @xmath26 .",
    "additionally , both the main component and the burst are allowed to exhibit a variable amount of extinction by dust .",
    "this takes into account the fact that young stars are found in dusty environments and that the starlight from the galaxy as a whole may be reddened by a ( geometry dependent ) different amount .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that the extinction derived from the balmer decrement in the sdss sample is independent of inclination , which , on the other hand , is driving global extinction ( ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "this is different from the approach taken by k03 , where a single extinction value for the whole galaxy is used .",
    "we compute the full likelihood distribution on a grid in this 6-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath27 } , t , a_v^1 , \\beta , a_v^2 $ ] ) , the likelihood of each model being @xmath28 . to compute the likelihood distribution of @xmath9 , we weight the @xmath9  of each model by its likelihood and marginalize over all parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath9  is obtained from the width of this distribution .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loglik ] , where we show seds and likelihood functions for two objects , a young object with a high burst fraction , and an older and fairly quiescent object .",
    "we show projections of the likelihood function onto four planes in parameter space , age vs.  dust in the main component , burst fraction vs.  burst extinction , age of the main component vs.  burst fraction , and star formation timescale , @xmath29 , vs.  burst fraction .",
    "the figure also shows the resulting likelihood distributions of @xmath9  in the g , i , and k bands .",
    "note that for the quiescent object , the width of the @xmath9   distribution is very similar in the g and k bands , while it is much wider in g than it is in k for the younger star forming object . on average , the width of the likelihood distribution of @xmath9  at 68% confidence level is between @xmath30 and @xmath31  dex ( using @xmath32 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in mass has a weak dependence on mass ( increasing with lower @xmath33 photometry ) and much of the variation is in spectral type : early - type galaxies have more tightly constrained masses than late types ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : loglik ] ) . using the u band",
    ", the uncertainty in mass grows by @xmath34  dex .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : mass - comp ] we compare our photometry - based stellar mass estimates to the stellar masses of k03 .",
    "we show the h@xmath2   equivalent width ( as measured by the sdss ) by color coding .",
    "the overall impression from this figure is that the two different estimators agree remarkably well , within a rms scatter of only @xmath35 dex over almost 4 decades in mass ( and hence they largely agree within their respective uncertainties ) .",
    "this is only a relative statement , though .",
    "it does not imply that the masses are accurate to that level in an absolute sense , although it is very reaffirming .",
    "however , as may be expected , there are systematic differences as a function of star formation activity on the @xmath1  dex level .    the d@xmath74000  and h@xmath8  based method of k03 yields masses almost identical to ours for weakly star forming objects ( eqw(h@xmath2 ) @xmath36 ) at masses above @xmath37  @xmath26 .",
    "at lower masses , our estimator tends to give slightly higher masses than k03 s . for more strongly star forming objects , the photometrically determined masses are smaller than the ones of k03 . for objects with eqw(h@xmath2 ) @xmath38 , the discrepancy becomes as large as 0.15 dex , independent of mass .",
    "note that at high redshift , such objects will be more common .",
    "we suspect that there are a multitude of reasons for these differences based on the different sampling of stellar populations by both methods ( if we leave out the jhk bands , our masses become more similar in their trends to k03 s , although with increased scatter ) .",
    "plausibly , though , this is explainable by the fact that the photometrically determined masses sample the light from the whole galaxy , while k03 s sdss - based sampling of d@xmath74000  and h@xmath8  covers only the inner 3 arcseconds . since most galaxies are redder in their centers than in the outer parts , this might lead to higher masses for star forming disk galaxies .",
    "early - type galaxies without blue star forming disks do not suffer from this effect .",
    "this is confirmed by restricting the sample to low redshifts , which maximizes the effect . also , at the lowest masses , galaxies might have more irregular sfhs , and photometric methods might fail in this case @xcite . however , fig.[fig : mass - comp ]",
    "does not show a dependence of the residuals on mass , only on current star formation rate .",
    "[ fig : mass - comp ] also shows that our masses based on the g band are very similar to the ones estimated through the k band . for early type systems and weakly star forming systems , they are statistically indistinguishable . star forming systems , however , tend to have g - band masses lower by @xmath39  dex .",
    "the good agreement is partly due to the fact that the effect of dust extinction and age on the effective @xmath9  are very similar in canonical models , as has been pointed out by @xcite , although they are not completely degenerate .",
    "typically , the spread of the stellar @xmath9  in the galaxy population at any given luminosity is around 0.7  dex in g and 0.35  dex in k. these results is reaffirming since the restframe blue spectral range is accessible to photometry to very high redshift , and thus high-@xmath10 studies mostly rely on @xmath40 .",
    "since we do not have a fiducial mass estimator ( neither for stellar mass nor for total mass , for that matter ) , it is only natural to ask how the stellar mass measurements presented here compare with estimators of mass based on kinematic data .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that stellar mass ( or , more accurately , baryonic mass ) and total mass are tightly related and that stellar mass can be used as a surrogate for total mass in the context of high-@xmath10 galaxy surveys to probe structure formation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we use the measurements of velocity dispersion , @xmath41 , and effective radius in the g band , @xmath42 , provided by the sdss pipeline to plot stellar mass vs.  dynamical mass , @xmath43 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass - dyn ] .",
    "the left hand panel shows @xmath44   vs.  photometric stellar mass and the right hand panel shows @xmath44   vs.  the stellar masses of k03 .",
    "color again encodes h@xmath2  equivalent width .    above @xmath45  @xmath26 ,",
    "the stellar masses from both methods follow the dynamical masses remarkably well . below @xmath46",
    "@xmath26 , the velocity dispersion measurements of the sdss becomes unreliable as we approach the instrumental resolution of the data ( @xmath47  km s@xmath48 ) .    at higher masses , although both estimators generally follow @xmath44 , there are again some differences , and both estimators show similar trends in their residuals although with different amplitudes .",
    "stellar masses agree very well with @xmath44  at the highest masses ( which are mostly populated by old , quiescent objects ) . at lower masses , stellar masses",
    "show a trend to larger values than @xmath44  with decreasing mass and with increasing h@xmath2  emission line equivalent width .",
    "this effect is weak in the photometric estimator , and stronger in k03 s method , which gives stellar masses larger than @xmath44  by 0.1 to 0.4  dex at almost all masses .",
    "this comparison is unchanged by using @xmath49  instead of @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath44  is not a good estimator of total mass , and that this comparison is again only to be taken in relative terms .",
    "in fact @xmath50 can only provide a lower limit to the mass .",
    "however , as long as a bulge is present , the total mass should not be underestimated by more than @xmath51  dex ( see , e.g.   fig .  4 in @xcite ; also @xcite , who show that @xmath50 is a reasonable mass estimator , although this paper is concerned with ellipticals only ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising to find stellar masses in excess of @xmath44  and the difference between the two increasing at lower masses .    nevertheless , the point of this work is to assess the general consistency and reliability of stellar mass estimates than to investigate the relationship between stellar and dynamical mass in galaxies .",
    "[ fig : mass - dyn ] shows that the estimators of stellar mass , and especially the photometric estimator which is most easily obtainable for large high redshift samples ( covering a bluer wavelength range , though ) , closely follow @xmath44  as measured by this simple dynamical measure .",
    "we can not see significant systematic deviations which would bias or invalidate this estimator .",
    "this is a very encouraging result , since such an estimator is very likely to be the only one available at @xmath3 for some time to come .",
