    "contemporary cosmology focuses on the either early - universe inflationary @xcite or present acceleration expansion hypothesized as effects of dynamical scalar fields such as inflaton or quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite or by effect of gravitational modifications such as braneworlds , @xmath0 , scalar - tensor theories as described in @xcite and references therein . on the observation side ,",
    "the present acceleration and inflation have been convinced by results from sn ia @xcite , large - scale structure surveys @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies @xcite and x - ray luminosity from galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the prediction suggests that the viable dark energy models for present acceleration should not give too different results from that of the @xmath1cdm model while , for the inflation , the model should pass planck 2015 cmb anisotropies constraint @xcite , e.g. giving tensor - to - scalar ratio not exceeding the upper bound of @xmath2 and having spectrum index , @xmath3 .",
    "one way to result in acceleration phase is to have a coupling between the scalar field to gravity sector such as @xmath4 which is motivated in scalar qed , theories with density dependent newton s constant @xcite or with non - minimal coupling ( nmc ) terms like @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite obtained as lower energy limits of extra - dimensional theories or weyl anomaly of @xmath7 conformal supergravity @xcite .",
    "it is also possible , without loss of generality , to have coupling term between derivative of the scalar field and gravity , dubbed non - minimal derivative coupling ( nmdc ) , in form of @xmath8 and @xmath9 which as well results in acceleration @xcite .",
    "relating the two couplings as @xmath10 , combination of the two terms gives the einstein tensor .",
    "hence this is a theory with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the nmc and nmdc are found to be a spacial case of horndeski s theory which is generalization of gravitational theory with at most second - order derivatives in the equations of motion , making the horndeski action the most general scalar - tensor theory @xcite .",
    "considering the nmdc theory proposed by @xcite , the metric @xmath12 is considered as a dynamical field .",
    "this approach is the metric formalism .",
    "when the metric field and the connection field both take the role of independent dynamical fields , the approach is of the palatini formalism @xcite .",
    "the two formalisms result in equivalent field equation for the gr case .",
    "however , for modified gravity , the field equations alter from each other .",
    "the nmdc - palatini action is expressed as [ action nmdc palatini2 ] =  [ -  ( g _ + _ ) ^,^,-2v ] , of which @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "the palatini einstein tensor is @xmath20 with details referred to @xcite . in cosmological scenario ,",
    "the nmdc - palatini effect , playing a role of dark energy , phantom crossing with oscillating eos is possible @xcite .",
    "considering nmdc - palatini effect , as role of inflaton in the chaotic inflationary model , the tensor - to - scalar ratio and spectral index could pass the planck 2015 constraint for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the nmdc - palatini field equations in slowly - rolling scalar field regime are @xcite h^2  [ 1 + ( 1+w_eff ) ] -  [ 1 + + 3 w_eff (1 + ) ] , with the acceleration condition , @xmath22 considering only the scalar field as a single species in inflationary epoch , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . hence h^2 [^2+v ( ) + ] , [ frinphiv1 ] and  ( + v^ + 6 ) -+--.[hdotexpressionfluid ] the acceleration is found from the eqs .",
