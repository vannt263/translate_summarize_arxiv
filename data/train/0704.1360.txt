    "the idea that a unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity implies the notion of a fundamental length is not new@xcite .",
    "however , it has only recently been established that no operational procedure could exclude the discreteness of space - time on distances shorter than the planck length@xcite .",
    "this makes the case for a fundamental length of the order of the planck length much stronger .",
    "it seems reasonable to think that any quantum description of general relativity will have to include the fact that measurement of distance shorter than the planck length are forbidden .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to build a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "besides technical difficulties the lack of experimental guidance , the planck length being so miniscule @xmath0 cm , is flagrant . in this work",
    "we shall however argue that a fundamental length in nature , even if it is as small as the planck scale may have dramatic impacts on our universe .",
    "in particular , we will argue that it may be related to the vacuum energy , i.e. dark energy and thus account for roughly 70@xmath1 of the energy of the universe .",
    "we shall first present our motivation for a minimal length which follows from quantum mechanics , general relativity and causality .",
    "we will then argue that a fundamental length in nature may lead to unimodular gravity .",
    "if this is the case , the cosmological constant is an integration parameter and is thus arbitrary .",
    "finally , we shall consider argument based on spacetime quantization to argue that the cosmological constant might not be actually constant but might be time dependent .",
    "we first review the results obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "we show that quantum mechanics and classical general relativity considered simultaneously imply the existence of a minimal length , i.e. no operational procedure exists which can measure a distance less than this fundamental length .",
    "the key ingredients used to reach this conclusion are the uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics , and gravitational collapse from classical general relativity .    a dynamical condition for gravitational collapse is given by the hoop conjecture@xcite",
    ": if an amount of energy @xmath2 is confined at any instant to a ball of size @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , then that region will eventually evolve into a black hole .",
    "we use natural units where @xmath5 and newton s constant ( or @xmath6 ) are unity",
    ". we also neglect numerical factors of order one .    from the hoop conjecture and the uncertainty principle",
    ", we immediately deduce the existence of a minimum ball of size @xmath6 .",
    "consider a particle of energy @xmath2 which is not already a black hole .",
    "its size @xmath7 must satisfy @xmath8~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is its compton wavelength and @xmath2 arises from the hoop conjecture .",
    "minimization with respect to @xmath2 results in @xmath7 of order unity in planck units or @xmath10 .",
    "if the particle is a black hole , then its radius grows with mass : @xmath11 .",
    "this relationship suggests that an experiment designed ( in the absence of gravity ) to measure a short distance @xmath12 will ( in the presence of gravity ) only be sensitive to distances @xmath13 .",
    "let us give a concrete model of minimum length .",
    "let the position operator @xmath14 have discrete eigenvalues @xmath15 , with the separation between eigenvalues either of order @xmath6 or smaller .",
    "for regularly distributed eigenvalues with a constant separation , this would be equivalent to a spatial lattice",
    ". we do not mean to imply that nature implements minimum length in this particular fashion - most likely , the physical mechanism is more complicated , and may involve , for example , spacetime foam or strings",
    ". however , our concrete formulation lends itself to detailed analysis .",
    "we show below that this formulation can not be excluded by any gedanken experiment , which is strong evidence for the existence of a minimum length .",
    "quantization of position does not by itself imply quantization of momentum .",
    "conversely , a continuous spectrum of momentum does not imply a continuous spectrum of position . in a formulation of quantum mechanics on a regular spatial lattice , with spacing @xmath16 and size @xmath17 , the momentum operator has eigenvalues which are spaced by @xmath18 . in the infinite volume limit",
    "the momentum operator can have continuous eigenvalues even if the spatial lattice spacing is kept fixed .",
    "this means that the displacement operator @xmath19 does not necessarily have discrete eigenvalues ( the right hand side of ( [ disp ] ) assumes free evolution ; we use the heisenberg picture throughout ) .",
    "since the time evolution operator is unitary the eigenvalues of @xmath20 are the same as @xmath21 .",
    "importantly though , the spectrum of @xmath21 ( or @xmath20 ) is completely unrelated to the spectrum of the @xmath22 , even though they are related by ( [ disp ] ) . a measurement of arbitrarily small displacement ( [ disp ] ) does not exclude our model of minimum length . to exclude it",
    ", one would have to measure a position eigenvalue @xmath23 and a nearby eigenvalue @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "many minimum length arguments are obviated by the simple observation of the minimum ball .",
    "however , the existence of a minimum ball does not by itself preclude the localization of a macroscopic object to very high precision .",
    "hence , one might attempt to measure the spectrum of @xmath21 through a time of flight experiment in which wavepackets of primitive probes are bounced off of well - localised macroscopic objects . disregarding gravitational effects",
    ", the discrete spectrum of @xmath21 is in principle obtainable this way .",
    "but , detecting the discreteness of @xmath21 requires wavelengths comparable to the eigenvalue spacing . for eigenvalue spacing comparable or smaller than @xmath6 , gravitational effects",
    "can not be ignored , because the process produces minimal balls ( black holes ) of size @xmath6 or larger .",
    "this suggests a direct measurement of the position spectrum to accuracy better than @xmath6 is not possible .",
    "the failure here is due to the use of probes with very short wavelength .    a different class of instrument ,",
    "the interferometer , is capable of measuring distances much smaller than the size of any of its sub - components .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainty principle and gravitational collapse prevent an arbitrarily accurate measurement of eigenvalue spacing .",
    "first , the limit from quantum mechanics . consider the heisenberg operators for position @xmath26 and momentum @xmath27 and recall the standard inequality @xmath28 \\rangle ) ^2 ~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] suppose that the position of a free mass is measured at time @xmath29 and again at a later time .",
    "the position operator at a later time @xmath30 is @xmath31 we assume a free particle hamiltonian here for simplicity , but the argument can be generalized@xcite .",
    "the commutator between the position operators at @xmath29 and @xmath30 is @xmath32 ~=~ i { t \\over m}~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so using ( [ unc ] ) we have @xmath33 we see that at least one of the uncertainties @xmath34 or @xmath35 must be larger than of order @xmath36 . as a measurement of the discreteness of @xmath21 requires",
    "_ two _ position measurements , it is limited by the greater of @xmath34 or @xmath35 , that is , by @xmath36 , @xmath37   \\geq \\sqrt { t \\over 2 m } ~~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the time over which the measurement occurs and @xmath38 the mass of the object whose position is measured . in order to push @xmath39 below @xmath6 , we take @xmath38 to be large . in order to avoid gravitational collapse , the size @xmath3 of our measuring device must also grow such that @xmath40 . however , by causality @xmath3 can not exceed @xmath30 .",
    "any component of the device a distance greater than @xmath30 away can not affect the measurement , hence we should not consider it part of the device .",
    "these considerations can be summarized in the inequalities @xmath41 combined with ( [ sql ] ) , they require @xmath42 in planck units , or @xmath43    notice that the considerations leading to ( [ sql ] ) , ( [ cgr ] ) and ( [ dlp ] ) were in no way specific to an interferometer , and hence are device independent . in summary ,",
    "no device subject to quantum mechanics , gravity and causality can exclude the quantization of position on distances less than the planck length .",
    "general relativity is a scaleless theory : @xmath44 varying this action with respect to the metric @xmath45 leads to the well - known einstein equations .",
    "the action ( [ gract ] ) is invariant under general coordinate transformations and this may seem at odd with the notation of a minimal or fundamental length in nature . this may suggest that a quantum mechanical description of general relativity will fix the measure of einstein - hilbert action @xmath46 to some constant linked to the fundamental length . in that case one",
    "is led to unimodular gravity : @xmath47 with the constraint @xmath48 constant which implies that only variation of the metric which respect this contraint may be considered .",
    "this is basically the argument made by anderson and finkelstein @xcite in favor of a unimodular theory of gravity",
    ".    there may be different ways to implement a minimal length in a theory , but we shall concentrate on one approach based on a noncommutative spacetime which indeed leads to a unimodular theory of gravity . positing",
    "a noncommutative relation between e.g. @xmath23 and @xmath49 implies @xmath50 , with @xmath51=i \\theta^{xy}$ ] and where @xmath52 is the minimal length introduced in the theory .",
    "this also implies that a spacetime volume is quantized @xmath53 .",
    "one of the motivations to consider a noncommutative spacetime is that the noncommutative relations for the coordinates imply the existence of a minimal which can be thought of being proportional to the square root of the vacuum expectation value of @xmath54 i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "if this length is fundamental it should not depend on the observer .",
    "assuming the invariance of this fundamental length , one can show that there is a class of spacetime symmetries called noncommutative lorentz transformations@xcite which preserve this length .",
    "it has recently been shown@xcite , that there are also general coordinate transformations @xmath56 that leave the canonical noncommutative algebra invariant and thus conserve the minimal length : @xmath57=i \\theta^{\\mu \\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is constant and antisymmetric .",
    "they are of the form : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is an arbitrary field .",
    "the jacobian of these restricted coordinate transformations is equal to one .",
    "this implies that the four - volume element is invariant : @xmath60 .",
    "these noncommutative transformations correspond to volume preserving diffeomorphisms which preserve the noncommutative algebra .",
    "a canonical noncommutative spacetime thus restricts general coordinate transformations to volume preserving coordinate transformations .",
    "these transformations are the only coordinate transformations that leave the canonical noncommutative algebra invariant .",
    "they form a subgroup of the unimodular transformations of a classical spacetime .",
    "the version of general relativity based on volume - preserving diffeomorphism is known as the unimodular theory of gravitation@xcite .",
    "unimodular gravity here appears as a direct consequence of spacetime noncommutativity defined by a constant antisymmetric @xmath54 .",
    "one way to formulate gravity on a noncommutative spacetime has been presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "our approach might not be unique , but if the noncommutative model is reasonable , it must have a limit in which one recovers the commutative unimodular gravity theory in the limit in which @xmath54 goes to zero . for small @xmath54",
    "we thus expect @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the usual ricci scalar once matter is included , one finds the following equations of motion : @xmath63 these equations do not involve a cosmological constant and the contribution of vacuum fluctuations automatically cancel on the right - hand side of eq.([eqofmo ] ) .",
    "as done in e.g. ref.@xcite we can use the bianchi for @xmath3 and the equations of motion for @xmath64 and find : @xmath65 which can be integrated easily and give @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an integration constant .",
    "it can then be shown that the differential equations ( [ eqofmo ] ) imply @xmath68 i.e. einstein s equations@xcite of general relativity with a cosmological constant @xmath67 that appears as an integration constant and is thus uncorrelated to any of the parameters of the action ( [ ncaction ] ) .",
    "as we have shown , one needs to impose energy conservation and the bianchi identities to derive eq.([einstein ] ) from eq.([eqofmo ] ) .",
    "because any solution of einstein s equations with a cosmological constant can , at least over any topologically @xmath69 open subset of spacetime , be written in a coordinate system with @xmath70 , the physical content of unimodular gravity is identical at the classical level to that of einstein s gravity with some cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "we now come to the link between a fundamental length and cosmology and rephrase the arguments developed in refs.@xcite within the framework of a fundamental length .",
    "it has been shown that the quantization of an unimodular gravity action proposed by henneaux and teitelboim@xcite , which is an extension of the action defined in eq .",
    "( [ ncaction ] ) , leads to an uncertainty relation between the fluctuations of the volume @xmath71 and those of the cosmological constant @xmath67 : @xmath72 using natural units , i.e. @xmath73 . now",
    "if spacetime is quantized , as it is the case for noncommuting coordinates , we expect the number of cells of spacetime to fluctuate according to a poisson distribution , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the number of cells .",
    "this is however obviously an assumption which could only be justified by a complete understanding of noncommutative quantum gravity .",
    "it is then natural to assume that the volume fluctuates with the number of spacetime cells @xmath76 .",
    "one finds @xmath77 and thus @xmath78 , i.e. , we obtain an effective cosmological constant which varies with the four - volume as obtained in a different context in refs.@xcite . in deriving this result ,",
    "we have assumed as in refs.@xcite that the fluctuation are around zero as explained below .",
    "a minimal length thus leads leads to a vacuum energy density @xmath79 @xmath80 here we assume that the scale for the quantization of spacetime is the planck scale .",
    "a crucial assumption made in refs.@xcite as well is that the value of cosmological constant fluctuates around zero .",
    "this was made plausible by baum@xcite and hawking@xcite using an euclidean formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "now the question is really to decide what we mean by the four - volume @xmath71 .",
    "if this is the four - volume related to the hubble radius @xmath81 as in refs.@xcite then this model predicts @xmath82 which is the right order for today s energy density , it is however not obvious what is the equation of state for this effective cosmological constant . the choice @xmath83 might be ruled out because of the equation of state of such a dark energy model as shown in ref.@xcite in the context of holographic dark energy which leads to similar phenomenology .",
    "however if we assume that the four - volume is related to the future event horizon as suggested by m. li@xcite , again in the context of holographic dark energy , then we get an equation of state which is compatible with the data @xmath84 which is precisely the equation of state for the holographic dark energy obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "details will appear in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we have argued that an unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity implies that there is a fundamental length in nature in the sense that no operational procedure would be able to measure distances shorter than the planck length .",
    "further we give an explicit realization of an old proposal by anderson and finkelstein who had argued that a fundamental length in nature would imply unimodular gravity .",
    "finally , using hand waving arguments we show that a minimal length might be related to the cosmological constant , which if this scenario is realized , is time dependent and thus only effectively a constant .",
    "much more work remains to be done to establish this connection .",
    "it would be interesting to related the time dependence of the cosmological constant to that of other parameters of the standard model such as the fine - structure constant .",
    "indeed as argued in refs.@xcite if one of the parameters of the standard model , such as a gauge coupling , a mass term or any other cosmological parameter , is time dependent , it is quite natural to expect that the remaining parameters of the theory will be time dependent as well .",
