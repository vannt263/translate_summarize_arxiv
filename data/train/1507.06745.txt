    "due to massive growth of smart devices and increasing popularity of mobile applications , mobile traffic is expected to grow continuously at a rapid rate in the next few years . according to cisco",
    "s latest visual networking index ( vni ) report , the global mobile data traffic will increase nearly @xmath0-fold from 2013 to 2018 , and the average traffic generated by a smartphone will be @xmath1 gb per month by 2018 , a @xmath2-fold increase over the 2013 average of @xmath3 mb per month  @xcite . in order to cope with this ongoing tsunami of mobile data demand ,",
    "the operators have put forward multiple solutions , such as upgrading the existing networks , building up new networks , and implementing a usage - based pricing plan .",
    "mobile traffic offloading , or mobile data offloading , which refers to the use of complementary network technologies ( e.g. , wi - fi networks ) to deliver data originally targeted for cellular networks , has attracted a lot of attentions from both the industry and academia  @xcite . on the one hand , it is compelling to operators who want to reduce cellular traffic load with a low - cost solution and make better use of their existing assets . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also appealing to end - users , who enjoy the low price and high data rate of the complementary networks .",
    "a detailed survey of mobile traffic offloading can be found in  @xcite .",
    "most of the existing efforts have focused on wi - fi networks , in which cellular traffic is delivered by wi - fi connections when mobile users are within the coverage of wi - fi access points  @xcite .",
    "femtocells can also be used for mobile traffic offloading , which offload both air interface traffic and core network traffic from cellular systems  @xcite .",
    "some other offloading approaches exploit short - range communication techniques , such as device - to - device ( d2d ) communication and wi - fi direct , to offload the traffic of context - aware applications  @xcite . recently",
    ", social network services ( snss ) have taken a great portion of our daily life . in snss ,",
    "a large number of clients subscribe a common content provider that frequently pushes multimedia content to the subscribers , e.g. , text , photos , or videos , which generates thousands of duplicated downloads of the same content , and thus , consumes a great amount of bandwidth in cellular systems  @xcite .",
    "many efforts are being carried out to offload such traffic by exploiting opportunistic communications among mobile users  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the content provider first pushes the content to a target set of users as seeds via cellular networks , and later , the seed users use short - range communication techniques to share the content with other users in proximity while moving . at",
    "last , if some user fails to receive the content after a certain delay , it will download directly from the content provider via cellular networks .",
    "therefore , some of the non - seed users can be satisfied by opportunistic delivery and their cellular bandwidth can be offloaded .",
    "the efficiency of opportunistic offloading can be guaranteed because content subscribers can usually tolerate different delays between the content generation time and the user access time  @xcite , and meanwhile , they can frequently meet each other due to homophily and locality  @xcite .",
    "most of the existing approaches of opportunistic offloading focus on maximizing the overall system performance , such as the total bandwidth offloaded from the cellular networks , or the average delay of subscribers  @xcite . in order to maximize the system performance",
    ", these approaches require the seed users to download the content right after the content is posted online , and require all mobile users to unconditionally share the content with each other when they are in proximity .",
    "however , since both cellular and d2d transmissions may involve monetary cost of mobile users , these assumptions may not be hold for selfish users , who only consider their individual payoffs rather than the overall system performance .",
    "first , there is no incentive for a selfish user to join such approaches as a seed user , since seed users have to download each content update via cellular networks , while at the same time , to deliver the content to non - seed users via opportunistic communications .",
    "second , for the opportunistic sharing process , selfish users may have preference on the users that access the content at different times . usually , they tend to communicate with the users with early access times , since these users have a high probability to deliver the content , and thus , save the expensive cellular transmission . at last , privacy issues may also restrict opportunistic communications .",
    "usually , the users can help each other by opportunistic sharing only if they have a social relationship in the considered sns . in order to capture the dynamic behaviors of practical users and analyze its influence on the overall system performance ,",
    "it is necessary to reconsider opportunistic offloading from a new perspective that treats each mobile user as an independent decision maker .",
    "the idea of self - deciding users naturally leads us to game theory , in which all users are treated as rational players that focus on maximizing their own utilities . in this paper",
    ", we consider opportunistic offloading in d2d - enhanced cellular networks as a _ network formation game_. note that we specify on d2d - enhanced cellular networks only because they can provide a system - level short - range communication solution , which avoids the tedious discussions on the establishment of opportunistic connections as in other cases .",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "first , we propose a user - centered opportunistic offloading approach , in which each user can download the content at arbitrary times via cellular networks , and meanwhile , independently decide whether to opportunistically share the content with another user .",
    "specifically , we formulate the problem as a _ network formation game _ , in which the users autonomously form a cooperative network , and promise d2d sharing with their adjacent users .",
    "2 .   second , we provide the stability analysis of the dynamics of network formation and specify the conditions to form a _",
    "pairwise stable _ network . based on the network formation analysis",
    ", we propose a low - complex distributed network formation algorithm for the mobile users to decide their d2d transmissions in practice .",
    "third , simulation results show that the selfishness of mobile users can highly degrade the offloading efficiency , and gap is highly affected by the cost ratio between the cellular transmission and the d2d transmission , as well as the users access delays and mobility patterns .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    ", we provide the related works in the literature . in section",
    ", we present the system model by characterizing the users in terms of access delay , mobility pattern , and individual payoff . in section  , we formulate the considered problem as a _ network formation game _ so as to analyze the users selfish behaviors . in section  , we specify the conditions under which the users will form a _ pairwise stable _ network , and propose a practical network formation algorithm for the users can make selfish decisions based on their historical records . in section  , we provide the simulation results of algorithm convergence , offloading efficiency , and user payoff . in section  , we discuss some extensions of the proposed game - theoretical approach , and conclude the paper .",
    "in  @xcite , the proposed approaches assume a central controller to decide the seed users , and all users are required to unconditionally share its copy with every other user in proximity .",
    "as we noted , these approaches focus on the system performance and do no consider the selfishness of practical users , which is completely from the game - theoretic perspective of this paper . in @xcite , the authors propose an incentive framework to motivate the subscribers to leverage their delay tolerance for traffic offloading , in which the subscribers act as sellers to sell their tolerant delay by submitting a price to the content provider , and the content provider acts as the buyer to buy the delay tolerance from the subscribers .",
    "this mechanism gives mobile users the freedom to decide their tolerant delays , but still requires unconditional seeding and sharing as in previous approaches  @xcite .    in our previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we consider to use d2d communications to facilitate real - time multicasting services , such as football games broadcasting , by constructing a dynamic ad hoc network to detour the traffic from the base station . in this paper",
    ", we consider a different delay - tolerant publish / subscribe service , in which d2d links are utilized as opportunistic connections rather than instant ad hoc links .",
    "therefore , this paper is not a simple extension of  @xcite .",
    "data forwarding and data dissemination are highly related to the topic of opportunistic offloading .",
    "they all share the idea of delay tolerant networks and use short - range communications to improve the system performance .",
    "however , in data forwarding , there exists no cellular infrastructure and the problem is how to efficiently deliver the data from the source to the destination via opportunistic forwarding  @xcite , rather than offloading traffic from cellular networks . in data dissemination , or data spreading ,",
    "the problem is how to predict and accelerate the propagation of information in social networks , considering how we initially push the information , as well as how social impacts motivate the agents to re - share it  @xcite .",
    "recently , due to the rise of mobile devices , some studies combine the online sns and the offline mobile social networks so as to facilitate the information spreading process , while at the same time , reduce the cellular bandwidth by opportunistic communications between mobile users  @xcite .",
    "compared to opportunistic offloading , data dissemination does not have a strict publish / subscribe model , that is , there is not a specific set of subscribers that require the content .",
    "the  subscribers \" in data dissemination are gradually decided as the content is re - shared among agents in the online sns .",
    "although we do not consider data dissemination in this paper , we will show that the proposed game theory model and network formation algorithm can be extended to such scenarios .",
    "we consider a delay - tolerant publish / subscribe service in a d2d - enhanced cellular network , in which a content provider pushes information to @xmath4 subscribers , the set of which is given by @xmath5 , and the subscribers access the content with different delays .",
    "each subscriber is an independent user that can make long - term d2d sharing agreements with other users , that is , if an agreement is made between user @xmath6 and user @xmath7 , they will opportunistically share the content with each other using d2d communications when they are in proximity . if some user fails to achieve the content via opportunistic sharing before its tolerable delay , it will instantly download the content via cellular networks . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ system ] , users b and d download the content via cellular networks , user a opportunistically receives the content from user b who has an agreement with user a , and user c still waits for opportunistic sharing from other users .",
    "we assume the cellular network is in charge of the functions of user discovery and d2d establishment , and the associated signaling is negligible to size of the subscribed content . in the following part of this section",
    ", we will characterize the users access delays and mobility patterns , and then formulate their individual gain and cost in opportunistic offloading .      in publish",
    "/ subscribe applications , subscribers may access the service at different frequencies , and thus , endure different delays  @xcite .",
    "the delay tolerance of a subscriber is usually determined by the user s lifestyle , and it can be quantified by the _ access delay _ , which is defined as the time between the content generation time and the user s access time .",
    "we assume the content is always generated at @xmath8 , and denote the access delay of user @xmath6 as @xmath9 . in general , @xmath9 is a random variable defined in interval @xmath10 , with its probability distribution function ( pdf ) determined by user @xmath6 s lifestyle . in order to model the various pdfs of @xmath9 , we use the weibull distribution to profile the access delays  @xcite : @xmath11 where the parameter @xmath12 decides the shape of @xmath9 s pdf , i.e. , @xmath9 concentrates on higher values if @xmath13 is larger , and the parameter @xmath14 is a scale parameter that roughly decides the expected value of @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath9 is larger when @xmath14 is larger .",
    "we assume that the access times @xmath15 are stochastically independent .",
    "it has been studied that mobile users have different mobility patterns  @xcite . for a pair of users",
    ", the time line can be divided into contact times and inter - contact times .",
    "contact times are when the users stay in d2d range , and could therefore perform opportunistic sharing .",
    "inter - contact times are times between two consecutive contacts . referring to  @xcite , for a characteristic time in the order of half a day , we assume that inter - contact time of any two users @xmath6 and @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath16 , follow the pareto distribution : @xmath17 where the parameter @xmath18 decides the shape of @xmath16 s pdf",
    ", i.e. , @xmath16 concentrates more on low values if @xmath19 is larger , and the scale parameter @xmath20 identifies the minimum possible value of @xmath16 .",
    "the complementary cumulative distribution function of @xmath16 is given by : @xmath21 then , the probability that user @xmath6 and @xmath7 meet each other at least once during time period @xmath22 is given by : @xmath23    we assume that the inter - contact times @xmath24 are stochastically independent . also , we assume that the content can be instantly transmitted via d2d communications , and the  effective \" contact time can be negligible compared to the inter - contact time . thus , the reciprocal of the expected inter - contact time , @xmath25 , simply indicates the associated contact rate between user @xmath6 and user @xmath7 . in the literature ,",
    "the mobility characteristic is usually represented by a complete , weighted and undirected graph of all involved users , referred to as _ contact graph _",
    "@xcite , where the weight of the edge between user @xmath6 and user @xmath7 is the associated contact rate @xmath25 .      to analyze opportunistic offloading from the user s point of view",
    ", we need to specify the gain and cost of a mobile user in this mechanism .",
    "note that we assume a user @xmath6 will enjoy the content only after its access delay @xmath9 , no matter whether it receives the content via cellular networks or via d2d communications .",
    "thus , there is no difference in user experience between the cellular service or the opportunistic offloading service .",
    "the only difference is that opportunistic offloading may delivery the content through d2d communications , and thus , save the expensive cost of cellular downloading for user @xmath6 .",
    "we assume the monetary cost of downloading the content via cellular networks is homogeneous for all subscribers , and denote it by @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the gain of user @xmath6 in opportunistic offloading is given by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the expected number of d2d delivery from other users to user @xmath6 .",
    "in opportunistic offloading , user @xmath6 may transmit to or receive from other users via d2d communications , which may cause monetary and power cost .",
    "here , we simply assume that the cost of d2d transmission is homogenously @xmath29 , and that the cost of d2d reception is homogenously zero .",
    "usually , we have @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the cost of user @xmath6 in opportunistic offloading is given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the expected number of d2d delivery from user @xmath6 to other users .",
    "in this section , we introduce the proposed game - theoretic model , _ network formation games _ , using which the individual profits of mobile users rather than the overall system performance are considered to have the first priority in opportunistic offloading .      _ network formation games _ describe how a set of players can cooperate with each other by forming a network and thereby increase their utilities  @xcite . as for the considered opportunistic offloading problem ,",
    "the selfish mobile users are represented by the players in the game , and their agreements on opportunistic sharing are represented by the links between players . for each user ,",
    "its gain and cost can be captured by a function that depends on the entire network structure formed by all the users .",
    "formally , we define a network formation game as follows :    [ nfg - definition ] a network formation game is uniquely defined by a set of players @xmath33 and their network payoff functions @xmath34 . for each player @xmath35 and",
    "each network @xmath36 formed by all the players ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the payoff of player @xmath6 in network @xmath36 .    given that the opportunistic sharing agreement is a bilateral contact that indicates a mutual obligation , the links between players are undirected edges .",
    "also , for obvious reasons , loops and multiple edges are not allowed in the network .",
    "thus , the network @xmath36 formed by the players is an undirected simple graph , and we denote by @xmath39 as the set of all such graphs . for any network @xmath40 ,",
    "we define @xmath41 as the maximal connected subgraph of @xmath36 that contains user @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath42 is a connected subgraph with @xmath43 , and for any connected subgraph @xmath44 with @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 .",
    "to complete the proposed network formation game , we need to specify the network payoff function @xmath38 for each player @xmath35 .",
    "in general , the payoff function of player @xmath35 can be any function that increases with the gain @xmath47 in ( [ gain ] ) and decreases with the cost @xmath48 in ( [ cost ] ) . here ,",
    "for any network @xmath40 , we simply define the payoff of player @xmath6 as follows : @xmath49 note that only the users that are connected to user @xmath6 can effect user @xmath6 s delivery performance .",
    "the above payoff function can also be written as @xmath50 .",
    "however , even we restrict our consideration to @xmath41 , calculating of @xmath51 is extremely difficult due to the statistical correlation of the players in @xmath52 . in order to simply the calculation",
    ", we estimate the value of @xmath51 by considering only one - hop d2d transmissions , and denote the estimated value as @xmath53 . for any network @xmath40 and",
    "any player @xmath35 , we denote by @xmath54 as the set of player @xmath6 s adjacent players , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "we remark the players in @xmath54 as @xmath56 , and without loss of generality , we assume that the access delays of these players satisfy @xmath57 .    first , we note that only the players @xmath58 can download the content before time @xmath9 and thus can share the content with player @xmath6 via one - hop transmissions . for any player @xmath59 , it can share the content to player @xmath6 between the time interval @xmath60 , if there is no other player that receives the content and meets player @xmath6 at an earlier time .",
    "thus , the probability that player @xmath6 receives the content from player @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63\\right\\ } f^b_{i,\\alpha_l}(t - a_{\\alpha_{l } } ) dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given as in ( [ access - delay ] ) , ( [ inter - contact ] ) and ( [ meet ] ) , respectively , and some parameters are omitted for the sake of conciseness .    also , player @xmath6 may download the content directly from the base station at time @xmath9 , if no other players can deliver the content before @xmath9 , the probability of which is given by : @xmath67 with @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath66 are given as in ( [ access - delay ] ) and ( [ meet ] ) , respectively , with some parameters omitted .",
    "note that the one - hop assumption narrows our consideration down to the adjacent player in @xmath69 , and more importantly , eliminates the statistical correlation between them , such that we can calculate the effect of different players separately as in ( [ p - alphal - i ] ) and ( [ p - i - i ] ) . naturally , we have @xmath70 .    given ( [ p - alphal - i ] ) and ( [ p - i - i ] ) , we estimate the gain , cost , and thus the payoff of player @xmath6 as follows : @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73    in each realization of opportunistic offloading , the content data is delivered through a tree structure rooted at the cellular system , which guarantees the total number of transmissions , including both cellular and d2d transmissions , is fixed at @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the multi - hop d2d transmissions , which are not considered in our calculation , will increase the number of d2d transmissions , and at the same time , decrease the same amount of cellular transmissions .",
    "due to the fact that @xmath75 , we have that the overall payoff of the players in @xmath41 is underestimated , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , ( [ utility - es ] ) can be seen as the payoff function in the worst case scenario , and the network is expected to have a better performance .",
    "in this section , we consider how the players can automatically form a network .",
    "first , we specify the rules of network formation , which restricts what a player can be do in the network formation process .",
    "then , we analyze the stability of the outcome network under such network formation games . at last , we consider the practical issues and propose a low - complex algorithm that can be distributively performed by mobile users .",
    "the players in network formation games are independent decision makers who seek to maximize their individual payoffs by choosing selfish strategies .",
    "note that it does not imply that the players can not cooperate with each other .",
    "in many cases , the players are assumed to form cooperative groups , or coalitions , to increase the payoffs of coalition members , and such network formation games are often referred to as coalitional graph games  @xcite .",
    "in such games , the players in a coalition are treated as an entity and their payoffs are jointly decided by the entire coalition .",
    "in fact , for any network @xmath40 of our proposed game , any player @xmath6 can be seen as a member of coalition @xmath52 , and player @xmath6 s payoff @xmath77 is decided by the cooperation among all coalition members , i.e. , the structure of @xmath41 .",
    "however , this coalitional approach can be problematic in opportunistic offloading , as most of the subscribers are completely strangers without any communications , and the size of a potential coalition could be extremely large due to the huge amount of users in a publish / subscribe service .",
    "thus , we assume that the players individually choose their own strategies in the network formation process .    for any network @xmath40",
    ", the strategy of any player @xmath35 can be given by the set of player @xmath6 s adjacent links @xmath78 , which indicates all the opportunistic sharing agreements that player @xmath6 makes with other players . during the network formation process",
    ", each player can dynamically add links to the network and subtract the existing links from the network .",
    "note that an opportunistic sharing agreement indicates a mutual obligation of both ends , a link can exist only when it benefits both ends , and a link should be removed if any end can not benefit from it .",
    "formally , we give the rules of network formation as follows  @xcite :    1 .",
    "add a link @xmath79 to @xmath36 requires that both players @xmath6 and @xmath7 agree to add the link , i.e. , @xmath80 _ and _ @xmath81 , and we denote by @xmath82 as the set of all links that can be added to @xmath36 ; 2 .",
    "subtract a link @xmath79 from @xmath36 requires that player @xmath6 or player @xmath7 or both agree to subtract the link , i.e. , @xmath83 or @xmath84 , and we denote by @xmath85 as the set of all links that can be subtracted from @xmath36 ; 3 .",
    "link addition or link subtraction takes place one link at a time .",
    "the third rule implies that the players take random turns to alter their strategies , and in each turn , the corresponding player can only add a new link , or subtract an existing link . with this rule ,",
    "the size of the player s action space is restricted to @xmath4 .",
    "if we remove this rule , the player can add and subtract multiple links , and the size of its action space increases to @xmath86 .",
    "when @xmath4 is large , it will bring combinatorial difficulty for the player to decide a feasible action .",
    "therefore , we adopt the third rule in our proposed network formation game .      in network formation games ,",
    "the players keep changing their strategies to maximize their individual payoffs .",
    "the dynamics may end up to a network in which all players arrive their optimal strategies at the same time , i.e. , no player has the incentive to change its current strategy and thereby improve its payoff , assuming all the other players stick to their current strategies .",
    "such networks are called _ nash - stable _ networks , or nash networks  @xcite . in our proposed game ,",
    "the player s actions are restricted by the network formation rules , and nash stability is replaced by the following _ pairwise stability _",
    "@xcite :    [ pairwise - stability ] a network @xmath36 is pairwise stable if both of the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .   for any pair of players @xmath87 with edge @xmath88",
    ", we have @xmath89 or @xmath90 , or in other words , @xmath91 ; 2 .   for any pair of players @xmath87 with edge @xmath92",
    ", we have @xmath93 and @xmath94 , or in other words , @xmath95 .",
    "thus , a network is pairwise stable , if there is no incentive for any pair of players to add a link to the existing network and there is no incentive for any player who is party to a link in the existing network to dissolve or remove the link .",
    "on the left side has a circuit consists of nodes @xmath96 and @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 .",

    ". however , the existence of pairwise stable networks and the convergency of network formation rules are still unknown . in this subsection",
    ", we will specify the conditions under which the pairwise stable network exists and the players are guaranteed to converge to such networks by using the proposed network formation rules .    by viewing each network @xmath40 as a node in a larger network ,",
    "we define a _ rule supernetwork _ of the proposed network formation game as follows  @xcite :    [ rule - suppernetwork ] a rule supernetwork is a directed simple graph @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 if either of the following conditions is satisfied :",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "the entire rule supernetwork @xmath105 specifies how the network formation rules transform a network to another network .",

    "we remark the nodes in @xmath101 and denote by @xmath168 as the out - going edge of node @xmath169 .",

    "the decision period @xmath181 is assumed to cover plenty enough times of content deliveries , so that a user can make reliable records between two consecutive decisions .",

    "after a certain number of periods , all the existing links in the network will be cost - effective to both associated end users .",
    "note that the proposed network formation game and network formation algorithm can be extended to multiple publish / subcribe scenarios . in such cases ,",
    "the network payoff function should weight and sum up the payoffs from different services . in the network formation process",
    ", the users record the d2d communications of each service and jointly consider these data to decide whether an opportunistic sharing agreement is cost - effective .",
    "also , our methods can be extended to data dissemination problems , in which not only the mobility pattern but also the social impact among users should be considered in the payoff function . in such cases , the network payoff function should involve the social impact as well as the access delays of mobile users .",

    "as we see , the network connectivity drops quickly as the users remove their unwanted links during time periods @xmath210 to @xmath211 , and then when @xmath212 , the users maintain the cost - effective links and the network becomes stable .",
    "the changes in network connectivity highly influence the cellular traffic . as we see in fig .",

    "[ converge - efficiency ] is due to the statistic characteristics of each implementation in each time period .",
    "note that due to the randomness of the proposed network formation algorithm , the users may converge to different network structures even for the same implementation .    in fig .",

    "thus , the proposed algorithm can be applied to large - scale networks , and the convergence time is decided by the largest group in the network . in fig .",
    "[ convergetime - rate ] , we see that , as the cost ratio increases , which implies that the cost of d2d transmissions relatively decreases , the users are more willing to maintain sharing agreements with other users , and thus , the convergence time decreases and concentrates on a smaller range .      .",

    "therefore , the selfishness of mobile users can cost a high performance loss in practical scenarios , and the loss is highly influenced by the cost ratio @xmath221 .    for the random seeding algorithm",

    "if the seed users are below the optimal number , some of the non - seed users will not be able to receive the content via d2d transmissions before their access delays , and thus , they have to download the content from the base station and increase the cellular traffic .",
    "the envelope of all the random seeding curves provides the optimal performance of random seeding algorithm . as we see , when the network scale becomes extremely large , all the curves converge to the case where there is no seed users , since the seed number is negligible compared with the entire network . note that even when the seed number is zero , the users still get the content after their access delay .",
    "thus , d2d transmissions still exist among the users with different access delays and the network can still offload cellular traffic .    for the proposed network formation algorithm , we see that its performance highly depends on the cost ratio @xmath221 , as in fig .",
    "[ efficiency - n ] .",
    "for any cost ratio @xmath221 , we can see that its cellular traffic decreases as the number of users @xmath4 increases , which implies that the offloading efficiency increases with the network scale .",
    "when @xmath4 is small , the network is relatively highly connected , and the selfish behavior of the users with short access delay , i.e. , removing the non - profitable links , may influence a large population .",
    "when @xmath4 is large , the network is relatively sparse , and the influence of those selfish behaviors are restricted to a smaller population .",
    "therefore , the performance of the proposed algorithm improves as the number of uses @xmath4 increases .",
    "when @xmath4 is extremely large , the network is extremely sparse where the selfish behaviors only influence the neighbor users .",
