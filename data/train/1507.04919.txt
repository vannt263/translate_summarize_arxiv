    "the critical excitation energy decreases with increasing baryon number and the curves converge as the distance to the maximum mass configuration diminishes .",
    "furthermore , regardless of the baryon number considered , the soft gz case ( case ii ) exhibits a smaller critical energy than the tm1 case ( case iii ) , which itself lies below the stiff gz case ( case i ) .",
    "the dependence on the type of perturbation is remarkably weak . for the case of the velocity induced perturbation we find an invariance of the critical energy with respect to the sign of the velocity ,",

    "our reported values consistently exceed those reported in @xcite for polytropic `` gaussian packet systems '' by a factor of 1.2 to 2.5 .",
    "we find the same dependence on baryon number , even though our result seems to support a convex dependence and we can not confirm their flattening at high baryon masses .",
    "in this work we have studied the dynamical evolution of nonlinear perturbations on spherical configurations with a baryon mass above 90% of the maximal value of the respective eos .",
    "numerical simulations in full gr were performed with no other restrictions , than spherical symmetry and ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the calculations were done for 3 different eos and 10 different values of the stellar rest mass .",
    "a bisection strategy was invoked to determine the minimal energy for each eos and baryon mass , which leads to black hole formation .",
    "this energy turns out to be more than an order of magnitude below the mass difference to the maximum mass configuration of the considered eos . the critical energy increases with decreasing baryon number , i.e. the stars on the stable branch of the mass - radius diagram are _ stable to a different extent_. furthermore its dependence on the type of perturbation is weak , but we have found a noticeable dependence on the eos .",
