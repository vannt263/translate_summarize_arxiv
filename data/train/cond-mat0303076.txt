    "single molecular micromechanical experiments are among the major tools of modern biophysics . pioneered by the studies of double  stranded dna ( dsdna)@xcite , these techniques are now applied to a wide range of biologically relevant problems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "theoretically , it has been demonstrated that the observed response of dsdna to stretching ( i.e. elongation vs. pulling force ) can be successfully described by semiflexible worm - like chain ( wlc ) model @xcitemarko - siggia , over a considerable range of applied forces . within this model",
    ", the molecule is viewed as a rigid rod subjected to thermal fluctuations , and the only free parameter is its persistence length @xmath0 which is proportional to the bending modulus of the rod .",
    "since dna is strongly charged , the effects of the electrostatic interactions should in principle play a significant role in its elastic response . however , they are typically suppressed due to the strong screening under physiological conditions . in addition , it is implicitly assumed that the electrostatic effects can be incorporated by renormalization of the parameters of the effective models , e.g. persistence length @xmath0 in wlc .",
    "this is indeed a valid assumption in certain regimes , as was shown in works of odijk , and skolnick and fixman ( osf ) @xcite .",
    "they have demonstrated that within linearized debye - huckel ( dh ) approximation , there is an additive electrostatic correction to the persistence length of a semi - flexible wlc , and this term scales quadratically with debye screening length @xmath1 . however ,",
    "the classical result has to be significantly revised in the regime of highly flexible chains , which was in focus of numerous studies over the last two decades @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another limitation of osf picture is that it is only valid on the length scales larger than @xmath1 .",
    "when the chain is strongly stretched , its properties on shorter scales are being probed . within dh  theory ,",
    "this regime can be described in terms _ scale - dependent _ electrostatic rigidity @xcite @xcite .",
    "finally , osf result is known to be inadequate outside of dh approximation , i.e. in strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "compared to other aspects of the problem , its non - linear generalization has attracted only a limited attention since the early works back in 80s @xcite @xcite . in this paper , we study the electrostatic effects on the elastic response of strongly charged wlc , in the regimes of moderate and weak screening . in these regimes , dh approximation may no longer be applicable , and the analysis of the non - linear poisson - boltzmann equation is necessary . while stated as a generic problem , our study is especially important in the context of dna stretching experiments",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the problem and review the results obtained within dh theory .",
    "we revisit the problem of scale - dependent rigidity , and demonstrate that in the limit of weak screening , the chain exhibits a two - stage response .",
    "these two stages are characterized by the renormalized and bare persistence lengths , respectively , and they are separated by a peculiar `` unstretchable '' regime . in section iii , we study the problem beyond the linearized dh approximation .",
    "our central result is that the effective rigidity in the non - linear regime can be described by classical osf formula , in terms of  _ effective linear charge density _ determined by the far - field asymptotic of chain s electrostatic potential .",
    "this is the first explicit demonstration of the applicability  of the concept of renormalized charge in the context of the non - linear problem .",
    "while the notion of the effective charge is not new , in the past  it was introduced in a purely heuristic manner .",
    "as follows from our results , the effective charge approach has significant limitations and it is not valid on the length scale comparable to @xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the extension curve for strongly charged chains is different from the result of linearized dh theory , even upon the charge renormalization . finally , in section iv we discuss applications of the theory both to ds- and single stranded ( ss-)dna , and compare our results to the existing experiments .",
    "in the presence of monovalent ions of concentration @xmath2 , the electrostatic potential in water is well described by poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation : @xmath3here , reduced potential @xmath4 is expressed in units of @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the dielectric constant of water ; @xmath7 is bjerrum length , and @xmath8 is debye screening length . for low value of @xmath4",
    ", the above non - linear equation can be linearized , which corresponds to the well known dh approximation . in particular",

    "function @xmath14 determines the chain conformation in space , and it is subjected to constrain @xmath15 ( i.e. the chain is not extendable ) . within dh approximation , the electrostatic self - interactions of uniformly charged chain give rise to the following new term in hamiltonian@xmath16here @xmath17 is the linear charge density of the chain . manning parameter",
    "@xmath18 has the physical meaning of the number of electron charges per bjerrum length .    according to osf theory @xcite developed within dh approximation , the electrostatic interactions lead to a higher effective bending modulus of a semirigid chain .",
    "this results in renormalization of its persistence length : @xmath19for the case of flexible chain , osf approach has been revised by khokhlov and khachaturian , who have introduced the concept of electrostatic blobs @xcite . on",
    "the length scales smaller than blob size , @xmath20 , the electrostatic effects may be neglected .  on the larger scales , a flexible polyelectrolyte can be viewed as a stretched chain of blobs , and osf picture can be recovered upon proper renormalization of its parameters . for a semiflexible chains",
    ", we can introduce a characteristic length which would play the same role as the size of electrostatic blobs @xmath21 in flexible case : @xmath22 .",

    "the calculated stretching curves are shown in figure [ force - length - fig ] .",
    "interesting observations can be made by further analysis of the above result in the limit of weak enough screening , @xmath34 . in this case , the overall mechanical response has a striking _ two  stage _ character . for large forces , @xmath35 we recover well  known result for a neutral wlc @xcite : @xmath36 ^{-1}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{2\\pi } = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{kt}{% fl_{p } } }   \\label{flarge}\\]]in addition , one can identify a new moderate force regime , @xmath37 . in this case , eq .",

    "the second term is independent of force , and it indicates that stretching virtually stops when @xmath42 , while @xmath43 remains finite due to fluctuations on the scales smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that both the effective bending rigidity _ and the total chain length _ should be renormalized due to electrostatic interactions . in other words ,",
    "the chain becomes nearly `` _ _ unstretchable \" _ _ when end - to - end distance reaches certain value @xmath44 ( as shown in figure [ force - length - fig ] ) .",
    "electrostatic effects are relevant only if @xmath45 . when this condition holds , function @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ fmoderate ] ) has only weak ( inverse - logarithmic ) dependence on the screening length : @xmath47the chain remains ' ' unstretchable \" until the force becomes strong enough to suppress the small - scale fluctuations ( @xmath48 ) .",

    "strictly speaking , the linearization of eq .",
    "( [ pb ] ) is only possible for weekly charged chains or very strong screening . in a more general case",
    ", one has to study the complete non - linear equation . in order to apply our results for the case of strongly  charged polymers like ds- or ss- dna",
    ", one has to go beyond the linearized dh  approximation .",
    "early attempts of such a generalization go back to early 80s @xcite @xcite . at that time , it was shown by the numerical studies that effective rigidity clearly deviates from the linear osf theory .",
    "however , no alternative model had been proposed .",
    "various aspects of pb  equation in cylindrical geometry have been studied for several decades . among other important advances , was the discovery of the counter ",
    "ions condensation by manning @xcite .",
    "it was shown that when the linear charge density on a thin rod exceeds certain critical value , a finite fraction of the counter  ions gets localized within a near region of the rod , thus effectively reducing its overall charge .",
    "this phenomenon occurs at critical manning parameter @xmath49 . upon the condensation , the residual effective charge of the rod saturates at its critical value , @xmath50 . for a strongly  charged cylinder with a finite radius @xmath51",
    ", a similar phenomenon occurs with the effective charge becoming a function of aspect ratio , @xmath52 .",
    "following oosawa @xcite , the idea of separating condensed and free counter  ion components , has been widely used in literature . nevertheless , it is hard to justify its applicability for our problem .",
    "first , there is an ambiguity in defining the `` near '' and `` far '' region of the cylinder with a finite aspect ratio , and therefore the effective charge is not well defined .",
    "furthermore , the electrostatic interactions are strongest on lengths scales shorter than @xmath1 , exactly were dh approximation is invalid ( for @xmath53 ) .",
    "the leading corrections to the free energy due to small fluctuation of the chain can be evaluated without any model assumptions .",
    "namely , one can linearize pb equation near its solution for a static cylinder ( @xmath54 ) , and couple the perturbations of potential @xmath55 , to the conformational fluctuations @xmath56 .",
    "the displacements of the charged cylinder can be described by the local perturbations to the _ in - plane _ electrostatic moments . in particular , the monopole , dipole and quadrupole moments have the following forms , respectively:@xmath57@xmath58@xmath59 .\\]]here , @xmath60 takes into account the fact that the cylinder of radius @xmath51 with linear density density @xmath61 , fluctuates in oppositely  charged environment with local charge density @xmath62 .",
    "we have limited our consideration to the leading three electrostatic moments because they are the only ones containing displacement @xmath56 in orders no greater than @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the general expression for the correction to the electrostatic hamiltonian ( second - order in @xmath64 ) is , @xmath65 \\mathrm{d}s+   \\label{h - el - nonlin}\\]]@xmath66here , the first term accounts for the fluctuations of the local linear charge density , @xmath67 . by symmetry reason , a similar term containing quadrupole moment @xmath68 is absent ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the second term in the above expression reflects the fact that the cylinder is no longer perfectly straight and its end - to - end distance is reduced by amount @xmath70 .",
    "the last term represents the dipole - dipole interactions , and this is the only _ non - local _ term in the effective hamiltonian :    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    here we have switch to fourier representation , and expressed the result in terms of the dipolar field @xmath74 .",
    "the latter satisfies the inhomogeneous linearized pb equation : @xmath75 \\phi _ { q}^{\\left ( 1\\right ) } = 0 ,   \\label{pbdip}\\]]subject to boundary condition:@xmath76    thus , @xmath77 } { k_{b}t}=\\sum\\limits_{q}% \\left [ \\frac{2\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}}{l_{b}}\\left ( \\phi _ { q}^{\\left ( 1\\right ) } \\left ( r_{0}\\right ) -\\phi _ { 0}^{\\left ( 1\\right ) } \\left ( r_{0}\\right ) \\right ) \\mathbf{u}_{q}\\mathbf{u}_{-q}+cq^{2}\\mathbf{u}_{q}\\mathbf{u}_{-q}% \\right ]   \\label{delta h}\\]]here the we have used the fact that the first two terms in eq .",

    "( [ pb ] ) and ( [ pbdip ] ) numerically , we found function @xmath86 for various regimes .",
    "its low-@xmath38 asymptotic may significantly deviate from classical osf result , which is consistent with the earlier studies @xcite @xcite .",
    "one could interpret this deviation in terms of renormalized effective charge , by defining the effective manning parameter @xmath87 so that in the limit @xmath88,@xmath89surprisingly , this effective effective charge appear to have a clear physical meaning . with an excellent accuracy , @xmath87 has  the same value as effective manning parameter @xmath90 which can be extracted from the far - field behavior of potential @xmath91 , i. e. @xmath92for @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath94 is the modified bessel function which is the solution to dh equation in cylindric geometry .",
    "figure [ qeff - fig](a ) demonstrates a striking correlation between @xmath95 and @xmath90 , in a wide range of parameters .",
    "each curve there corresponds to the fixed value of @xmath90 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively , as functions of the aspect ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the close agreement between the two types of data shows that @xmath98 and @xmath90 nearly coincide for an arbitrary value of the bare linear charge , as long as the aspect ratio @xmath52 remains small .",
    "figure [ qeff - fig](b ) illustrates the dependence of @xmath87 on the aspect ratio for the values of the bare charge close to those of dsdna and ssdna ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively ) .",
    "one can see that for the practical purposes , @xmath87 of ssdna is close to @xmath101 , while its value for dsdna follows the saturation curve ( corresponding to infinitely  charged cylinder with the same radius ) . note that the far - field definition of the effective charge is unambiguous , and it does deviate from oosawa  manning result , even for zero aspect ratio ( see figure [ qeff - fig](c ) ) .",
    "furthermore , one can modify oosawa - manning approach to evaluate the effective charge as a function of @xmath52 , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "the result of that calculation is also shown in figures qeff - fig(b)-(c ) , and it clearly deviates from our far - field based definition of @xmath87 .",
    "we have _ explicitly _ demonstrated that osf result is formally applicable even outside of dh approximation , given that the effective charge is properly defined .",
    "while similar effective charge descriptions have been previously utilized in several works @xcite@xcite , they were all introduced as purely empirical assumption .",
    "in fact , our result is rather non ",
    "trivial since the electrostatic interactions are strongest in the vicinity of the chain , where the effective description is not valid .",
    "the effective charge picture works only because the bending of the chain affects the far region much stronger than the near one .",
    "indeed , @xmath102 term in eq .",
    "( [ pbdip ] ) is most relevant for @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath103 the effective charge description breaks down , and deviations from dh approximation become considerable , as shown in figure [ pb - fig ] .",
    "qualitatively , this can be interpreted as an increase of the effective charge with @xmath38 : as one goes to smaller length scales , @xmath104 should shift from its far - field value @xmath90 , towards the bare manning parameter @xmath105 .",
    "the change of the overall shape of @xmath106 gives rise to modification of the stretching curves , compared to the results of dh  based theory , as shown in figure [ force - length - fig ] .",
    "naturally , these corrections are strongest for large ratios @xmath107 , which corresponds to wider dynamic range of relevant wave vectors .",
    "the above results can be applied to the experiments on both ds- an ssdna .",
    "the two cases are characterized by rather different values of the physical parameters . in particular ,",
    "the persistence length of dsdna , @xmath108 significantly exceeds that of ssdna chain , @xmath109 .",
    "in addition , their linear charge density differ approximately by factor of @xmath110 . finally ,",
    "while wlc model is well established as a standard description of dsdna , the situation with elasticity of ssdna is not as settled : the extensible version of wlc is among several proposed models all of which are in reasonable agreement with the existing experimental data @xcite .",
    "plots in figures [ force - length - fig](a ) and ( b ) roughly correspond to the parameters of ds- and ssdna , respectively .",
    "as one can see  from the figure , the two - stage behavior and the intermediate `` unstretchable '' regime becomes pronounced when @xmath1 substantially exceeds the persistence length .",
    "note however that this regime is unlikely to be accessible in the case of dsdna , since the double helix would become unstable at such a week screening due to the electrostatic repulsion between the strands .",
    "for ssdna , the two - stage stretching must be observable at @xmath111 .",
    "while figure [ force - length - fig ] gives only a general idea about the mechanical response of semiflexible chain with electrostatic interactions , a more detailed comparison of our results  with experiments is presented in figure [ exper ] .",
    "the plot shows the stretching  curves of ssdna taken at various screening conditions , as reported in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these experimental data are fitted by our theory with the debye screening length calculated for each salt concentration . as a result ,",
    "the only fitting parameter was  the _ bare _ persistence length @xmath0 , and the best fit is achieved at @xmath112 .",
    "this value is somewhat smaller that the earlier estimates of the _ effective _ persistence length @xmath113 , which difference is due to our explicit account for the electrostatic corrections to chain rigidity . unlike the plots in figure [ force - length - fig ] which for the sake of simplicity were calculated by assuming @xmath114 , in figure [ exper ] the non zero diameter of ssdna chain is taken into account .",
    "based on the known structure of the molecule , we have assumed @xmath115 , and this parameter was not used for fitting .    even though the theoretical stretching curves were calculated with wlc model , our approach can be also applied to alternative descriptions of ssdna , such as  extensible freely - joint chain model ( efjc ) . however , this modification is unlikely to produce any significant change since within the force range of interest , the competing models ( wlc , efjc , and discreet version of wlc ) are known to give nearly identical fitting to the electrostatics ",
    "free stretching behavior of ssdna @xcite .",
    "indirectly , this model independence is supported by the fact that the above experimental data were also successfully fitted with numerical simulations based on efjc model @xcite . in that work ,",
    "in addition to electrostatic interactions described within linear dh approximation with renormalized charges , the effects of excluded volume and hairpin formation were included @xcite .",
    "since these additional effects are only important for relative small chain extension , they were neglected in the context of our work .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the  effects of electrostatic self - interactions on elastic properties of strongly - stretched wlc , with application to ds- and ss - dna at moderate and weak screening conditions . by revisiting the earlier studied problem of scale  dependent electrostatic rigidity",
    "we have demonstrated that in the limit of weak screening , the mechanical response of the chain has a distinctive two - stage character .",
    "the two modes are characterized by the bare and the renormalized persistence length , respectively , and they separated by intermediate `` unstretchable '' regime .     the central theme of our work is the effect of non - linearity of pb equation on the classical results obtained within dh  approximation .",
    "consistently with previous studies of the problem @xcite @xcite , the osf result for the electrostatic renormalization of the persistence length is not applicable in the nonlinear regime , and in particular the scaling @xmath116 is not valid .",
    "however , we have explicitly demonstrated that the osf formula is formally correct if the actual line charge density is replaced with the effective one .",
    "the latter is determined from the far  field asymptotic of the electrostatic potential of the strongly stretched chain . in the light of this result , the deviation from osf scaling is due to the non - trivial dependence of the effective charge on the  aspect ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the renormalized osf description is however only partially adequate since the electrostatic corrections to the chain rigidity do not follow the result of dh theory on scales shorter that @xmath1 , even upon the charge renormalization .",
    "this deviation is due to the fact that the effective charge itself is a scale - dependent concept .",
    "our solution to the complete nonlinear problem is shown to give an adequate description to the experimentally observed stretching behavior of ssdna at various salt conditions .",
