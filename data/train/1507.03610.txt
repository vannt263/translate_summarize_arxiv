    "hairy black holes are interesting solutions of einstein s theory of gravity and also of certain types of modified gravity theories .",
    "the first attempts to couple a scalar field to gravity was done in an asymptotically flat spacetime finding hairy black hole solutions @xcite but these solutions violated the no - hair theorems because they were not physically acceptable as the scalar field was divergent on the horizon and stability analysis showed that they were unstable @xcite .",
    "then , by introducing a cosmological constant hairy black hole solutions with a minimally coupled scalar field and a self - interaction potential in asymptotically ds space were found , but it was unstable @xcite .",
    "also , a hairy black hole configuration was reported for scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite , but perturbation analysis showed the instability of the solution @xcite . in the case of a negative cosmological constant , stable solutions were found numerically for spherical geometries @xcite and an exact solution in asymptotically ads space with hyperbolic geometry was presented in @xcite and generalized later to include electric charge @xcite .",
    "then , a generalization to non - conformal solutions was discussed in @xcite .",
    "further hairy solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant were reported in @xcite with various properties . on the other hand , by introducing a coupling of a scalar field to einstein tensor that acts as an effective cosmological constant @xcite a hairy black hole solution was presented @xcite additionally , spherically symmetric hairy black hole solutions with scalar hair were found @xcite . additionally , there are also very interesting recent developments in observational astronomy",
    ". high precision astronomical observations of the supermassive black holes may pave the way to experimentally test the no - hair conjecture @xcite . also , there are numerical investigations of single and binary black holes in the presence of scalar fields @xcite .    on the other hand , the recent developments in string theory and specially the application of the ads / cft principle to condense matter phenomena like superconductivity ( for a review see @xcite ) , triggered the interest of further study of the behavior of matter fields outside the black hole horizon @xcite . in this context , the gauge / gravity duality is a principle which relates strongly coupled systems to their weak coupled gravity duals .",
    "one of the most well studied system is the holographic superconductor . in its simplest form ,",
    "the gravity sector is a gravitating system with a cosmological constant , a gauge field and a charged scalar field with a potential ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system defines a critical temperature above which the system finds itself in its normal phase and the scalar field does not have any dynamics . below the critical temperature the system undergoes a phase transition to a new configuration . from the gravity side",
    "this is interpretated as the black hole to acquire hair while from boundary conformal field theory site this is interpretated as a condensation of the scalar field and the system enters a superconducting phase .",
    "it is known that all solar system observations , such as light deflection , the perihelion shift of planets , the gravitational time - delay among other are described within einstein s general relativity .",
    "the study of geodesics has been performed under several black hole geometries .",
    "for instance , see @xcite for the motion of particles on ads space - time . in this work , motivated by black hole solutions with matter fields outside their horizon",
    ", we study their effect in the motion of massless and massive particles in the background of a four - dimensional asymptotically ads black hole with scalar hair @xcite .",
    "these hairy black holes solutions are characterized by a self - interacting potential that asymptotically tends to the cosmological constant , and the scalar field is regular everywhere outside the event horizon and null at spatial infinity .",
    "the geodesics are studied numerically and we discuss about the differences in the motion of particles between the four - dimensional asymptotically ads black holes with scalar hair and their no - hair limit , that is , schwarzschild ads black holes .",
    "also , we study classical tests such as perihelion precession , deflection of light and gravitational time delay in order to determine the contribution that arises from the scalar hair .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "it was shown , that for spherical horizons @xmath25 there is no phase transition of the hairy asymptotically ads black holes to schwarzschild ads black hole . however ,",
    "for hyperbolic horizons @xmath26 there exists a phase transition only for negative masses , and the hairy black hole dominates for small temperatures , while for large temperatures the topological black hole would be preferred , for more details see @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we perform a numerical analysis of the geodesics by considering the hairy black hole solution .",

    "<S> motivated by black hole solutions with matter fields outside their horizon , we study the effect of these matter fields in the motion of massless and massive particles . </S>",
    "<S> we consider as background a four - dimensional asymptotically ads black hole with scalar hair . </S>",
    "<S> the geodesics are studied numerically and we discuss about the differences in the motion of particles between the four - dimensional asymptotically ads black holes with scalar hair and their no - hair limit , that is , schwarzschild ads black holes . </S>",
    "<S> mainly , we found that there are bounded orbits like planetary orbits in this background . </S>",
    "<S> however , the periods associated to circular orbits are modified by the presence of the scalar hair . besides , we found that some classical tests such as perihelion precession , deflection of light and gravitational time delay have the standard value of general relativity plus a correction term coming from the cosmological constant and the scalar hair . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we found a specific value of the parameter associated to the scalar hair , in order to explain the discrepancy between the theory and the observations , for the perihelion precession of mercury and light deflection . </S>"
