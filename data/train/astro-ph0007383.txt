    "star formation in molecular clouds is a slow and seemingly inefficient process .",
    "clouds are transformed into stars far more slowly than gravity would allow ; only the deepest regions of clouds participate in star formation @xcite ; star - forming regions are disrupted before star formation is complete @xcite ; and individual protostellar cores may also shed mass on their way to stardom @xcite .",
    "a growing appreciation for the violence and ubiquity of protostellar outflows has led many authors to suggest that outflows provide the mechanism to regulate star formation and to dissipate star - forming gas , especially in regions that lack massive stars .",
    "protostellar outflows have been implicated in the support of molecular clouds and cluster - forming clumps against gravity @xcite and in the removal of gas from star - forming regions @xcite or from protostellar cores @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall construct quantitative models to determine the destructive effects of outflows on the molecular cores that make individual stars , and on the larger molecular clumps that make star clusters .",
    "space , generally identified from spectral line maps of molecular emission .",
    "_ star - forming clumps _ are the massive clumps out of which stellar clusters form . finally ,",
    "_ cores _ are regions out of which individual stars ( or multiple systems like binaries ) form .",
    "we also distinguish protostellar _ winds _ , which are ejected from the protostar or the protostellar disk , from protostellar _ outflows _ , which include material in both the swept - up ambient medium and the wind . ]",
    "disruption by outflows limits the efficiency of low - mass star formation ; it relates the mass function of cores to the stellar initial mass function ; and it determines whether a young stellar system will remain bound .",
    "the most direct progenitors of stars are dense cores within star - forming regions .",
    "the distribution of initial stellar masses is therefore controlled by two factors : the distribution of core masses , and the fraction of a given core that can successfully become a star @xcite .",
    "recent observations of the core mass distribution by indicate a similarity to the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "several authors have made theoretical predictions for the manner in which a protostar s wind truncates its own accretion , limiting the core mass that becomes stellar .",
    "@xcite matched the kelvin - helmholtz luminosity of the protostar with the accretion luminosity of its disk ( in the model of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to find the point at which disk accretion stops .",
    "similarly , @xcite matched the ram pressure of material falling directly onto the stellar surface ( in the same infall model ) with the wind ram pressure ; although it is more physical to consider ram pressures than luminosities , this theory does not explain what stops disk accretion .",
    "@xcite took a distinctly different approach : recognizing that material falling onto the disk might circumvent the outflow , they instead considered the disruption of the larger - scale density distribution of the accreting core . idealizing the core material as static , they argued that accretion would stop once a momentum - conserving wind bubble ( or a stellar hii region ) had traversed its radius . for fiducial values of the parameters ,",
    "they find quite low efficiencies , of order a few percent .",
    "all of these models have considered only spherical protostellar winds , and they have generally not treated anisotropies in the protostellar core material ( besides centrifugal deflection of the infall ) .",
    "however , the winds from young stars are collimated into jets on a short length scale , and the core is likely to be somewhat flattened because of support from poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite incorporated these very elements into a model for the early phase of a molecular outflow , during which it propagates into its own protostellar core .",
    "however , li & shu did not consider the implications of this model for the efficiency protostellar accretion .",
    "in  [ s : coredisruption ] we shall construct a model for the disruption of an accreting , somewhat flattened protostellar core .",
    "assuming that the wind intensity is directly proportional to the accretion rate , as in the x - wind model @xcite , and in some disk - wind models @xcite , we identify the angle from the axis within which core material is ejected and outside of which it is accreted . as in the model of @xcite , and",
    "also as argued by @xcite , protostellar accretion is terminated by the finite size of the protostellar core ; however , the efficiency with which the star forms is a function both of the flattening of the core , and the ratio of its sound speed to the characteristic wind velocity .",
    "we compare the results of this calculation to observations of core disruption and constraints on the efficiency of core collapse in ",
    "[ s : coreobs ] .",
    "a protostellar wind can have destructive effects on regions considerably larger and more massive than its own protostellar core , repercussions that have implications for the fates of young stellar clusters .",
    "stars are born in groups , deeply embedded within dense clumps of molecular gas .",
    "the fate of a nascent stellar system  whether to become an expanding association or to remain a bound open cluster  is determined by how rapidly and effectively it breaks free of the gas from which it was created .",
    "this process is primarily controlled by two parameters : the efficiency of star formation , defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars , and the time scale on which the remaining gas is disrupted .",
    "if the gas removal is rapid relative to the free - fall time @xmath3 , then more than half the mass must be in stars for the cluster to remain bound @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , sufficiently slow mass loss allows a virialized stellar system to expand adiabatically and to remain bound .",
    "@xcite studied intermediate cases , in which they found that part of the cluster was likely to escape even if a fraction remained bound .    empirically ,",
    "roughly only a tenth of all stars remain bound in clusters @xcite .",
    "the interactions between stars and gas must produce this statistic , yet the underlying mechanism by which gas is dispersed remains largely mysterious .",
    "most stars are born in large ob associations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the violent effects of the massive stars in these associations have the potential to disrupt the star - forming gas ; however , this can only be in addition to the disruptive effects of the low - mass stars themselves .",
    "we shall take the embedded clusters in l1640 as prototypical examples of groups of low - mass stars in the process of formation . as described by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "these clusters have several hundred stars apiece ; they are coincident with the densest and most massive molecular clumps in the region .",
    "stars currently constitute about @xmath4 of the total mass in the two largest clumps , but the others show a much smaller stellar fraction .",
    "moreover , star formation is restricted to these regions @xcite .",
    "this observation is consistent with the theory of @xcite that stars form only in regions of high extinction and therefore low ionization , so that ambipolar diffusion can lead to the creation of protostellar cores .",
    "it lends credence to the idea that the gas and stars can be treated as a finite , self - gravitating system of a definite mass and radius ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a notion we shall use in our analysis .",
    "in  [ s : clumps ] , we calculate the amount of gas removed from a clump by the bipolar molecular outflows driven by the stars themselves .",
    "there is ample evidence for the importance of gas removal by outflows from star - forming regions : note , for instance , the disruptions of pv cephei @xcite , b335 @xcite , lynds 1221 @xcite , hh83 @xcite , and circinus @xcite , and the eruptions of the irs3 outflow from barnard 5 @xcite and of the hh300 outflow from taurus @xcite .",
    "indeed , any example of protostellar jets and herbig - haro objects outside the source s parent cloud implies that potentially star - forming gas has been ejected .",
    "individual protostellar winds are thus remarkable in their ability to affect pre - stellar cores ( on @xmath5 scales ) , cluster forming clumps ( @xmath6 ) and giant molecular clouds ( @xmath7 ) , as evinced by the existence of parsec - scale flows @xcite .",
    "we shall gauge mass ejection using the model for protostellar outflows presented in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "this model generalizes the force distribution predicted in the x - wind model @xcite to a much wider class of winds .",
    "the interaction of the protostellar wind with the ambient medium occurs in a thin , radiative shell that conserves the wind momentum and ambient mass in each direction . in  [ s : mass ] we use this model to calculate the criterion for the outflow shell to be ejected in a particular direction .",
    "the mass loss from such outflows is estimated analytically in  [ s : clumps ] .",
    "the principal idealization in our treatment is that each star forms at the exact center of the clump distribution .",
    "therefore , we present in  [ s : numerics ] a numerical evaluation of the gas lost from a model clump , in which star formation is distributed according to the local ambipolar diffusion rate @xcite . in the appendix",
    ", we evaluate the detailed effect of gravity on the motion of an outflow shell .",
    "our analysis suggests that a significant amount of mass can be lost during the process of star formation itself .",
    "indeed , the rate at which mass is lost due to outflows is several times the rate at which gas is converted into stars .",
    "however , we do not consider the disruptive effects of massive stars , which might cause gas to be removed more rapidly .",
    "our results are therefore only rough upper limits for the star formation efficiency in clumps more massive than about @xmath2 , in which o stars will form .",
    "unlike most previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we divide the calculation of star formation efficiency into two parts : the disruption of a star s own protostellar core , and the disruption of a clump in which an aggregate of young stars is forming .",
    "different assumptions are appropriate for the two cases .",
    "for a core , the rates of accretion and outflow are directly proportional ; the axes along which the core is flattened and the wind is collimated are likely to be aligned ; the wind duration exceeds the free - fall time ; and the density distribution declines with radius approximately as @xmath8 . for the disruption of a cluster - forming clump ,",
    "opposite assumptions apply : for instance , winds are impulsive and not likely to correlate in direction with the clump s structure .      before getting into the details of the calculation",
    ", it is worthwhile to make a simple estimate of the outcome . the star formation efficiency for the formation of a single star is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass , @xmath11 ) for the mass of an individual star and its wind , and uppercase ( @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) for ambient cloud mass or the mass of an ensemble of stars . ] ejected from the protostellar core or star forming clump due to the formation of a single star of mass @xmath14 ( see  [ s : efficdefs ] below ) .",
    "the total momentum in the wind is @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the mass of the wind is a fraction @xmath16 of the stellar mass , so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this momentum is transferred to the cloud by radiative shocks ; as described above , such a model is in good agreement with observation @xcite . in order for the shocked gas to escape from the cloud",
    ", it must be moving at least at the escape velocity , @xmath19 .",
    "since the shocked gas has momentum @xmath20 , the ejected mass is a maximum if all the gas has this minimum velocity , @xmath21 assuming for the moment that this mass is large compared to the mass of the star that forms , as in the model of @xcite , we estimate the star formation efficiency as @xmath22 where the factor @xmath23 allows for the decrease in the momentum of the shocked shell due to the self - gravity of the core or clump .",
    "this argument can be refined by taking into account the central fact about protostellar winds , that they are collimated . as originally shown by @xcite and demonstrated more generally by @xcite , the wind momentum falls off approximately as @xmath24 for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is measured from the axis of the wind and @xmath27 is discussed in ",
    "[ s : wind - structure - duration ] below .",
    "the momentum inside @xmath26 thus scales as @xmath28 : equal amounts of momentum are contained in each octave of angle . since the area covered by the wind , and",
    "therefore the mass swept up , is dominated by the largest angle , it follows that most of the mass that escapes will indeed have the minimum possible velocity ( @xmath29 ) , as assumed above .",
    "furthermore , since the momentum is spread out logarithmically , only a fraction @xmath30 of the total momentum is available to eject matter at @xmath31 . as a result ,",
    "the star formation efficiency estimated above should be multiplied by this quantity .",
    "the calculations below show that this fraction is more precisely given by @xmath32 . defining the _ efficiency factor",
    "_  @xmath33 by @xmath34 we conclude that for small values of @xmath33 , the star formation efficiency @xmath35 ; at large values of @xmath33 , we expect @xmath36 to approach its maximum possible value , unity .",
    "these expectations are borne out by the results presented below .",
    "observe that the collimation of the wind reduces the mass that can be ejected by a factor @xmath37 and increases the star formation efficiency by the same factor . as a result ,",
    "our estimates of @xmath36 are significantly higher than those of @xcite and are in much closer agreement with observation .",
    "we begin by discussing the various possible definitions of the star formation efficiency . for the collapse of a protostellar core to form a single star ( or a binary )",
    "there is only one efficiency that can be defined , namely the ratio of the star s ( or binary s ) mass to that of its parent core : @xmath38 this definition is consistent with that in equation ( [ eq : epsa ] ) because when the star formation process is complete , all the mass has been incorporated into the star(s ) or ejected from the system .    for the formation of a stellar cluster in a molecular clump , we generalize",
    "@xmath36 so that it is the _ instantaneous _ star formation efficiency , which is the rate at which mass is converted into stars , divided by the rate at which mass is lost from the gas .",
    "( implicit in this definition is the notion that the star - forming clump is a well - defined gaseous system . )",
    "we assume that only two processes change the gas mass : star formation , and mass ejection due to outflows .",
    "then , the instantaneous star formation efficiency is @xmath39 where @xmath13 is the mass of a set of stars , @xmath12 is the mass of the clump , and @xmath10 is the total mass ejected from the clump by protostellar winds ; we anticipate that part , if not all , of the mass in the winds will be ejected from the clump , and this mass is included in @xmath10 . for the formation of a single star ,",
    "@xmath40 becomes @xmath14 and @xmath41 becomes @xmath10 ; as a result , in this case @xmath36 is the same as that in equation ( [ eq : epsa ] ) and is identical with @xmath42 . because of this generality , we shall often refer to @xmath12 as the `` cloud '' mass , using `` cloud '' to refer to either a clump or a core . as we shall see below , in our model",
    "the ejected mass is directly proportional to the stellar mass . as a result",
    ", @xmath36 can be evaluated at any convenient mass , such as 1 @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass ejected from the cloud due to the formation of a star of 1 @xmath43 .",
    "if gas is disrupted by other means , as might occur where massive stars are forming , then equation ( [ eq : epsilon2 ] ) will be an overestimate of @xmath36 .",
    "the _ observational _ measure of star formation efficiency , @xmath46 , is the current fraction of the total mass that is stellar : @xmath47 this quantity varies from zero to unity as a group of stars forms and is revealed . under the assumption that all the stars that have formed in the clump can be identified , even if the stars are unbound , the mass of the clump evolves as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the clump mass before any stars form . as a result , we have @xmath50    the _ total _ efficiency of the star formation process , @xmath51 , is the fraction of the initial clump mass @xmath49 that will ever become stars .",
    "star formation is finished once there is no more gas , and @xmath52 . from equation ( [ eq : sfe&epsilon ] )",
    ", we see that this occurs once @xmath53 ; therefore @xmath54 where the average is taken over the entire star formation process .",
    "the instantaneous and total efficiencies are approximately equal , so long as @xmath36 is relatively constant .    on the other hand , @xmath36 can be considered a typical value for the observed @xmath46 only if both are small .",
    "for instance , consider a clump in which @xmath36 is constant and star formation is half complete ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sfe&epsilon ] ) shows that @xmath56 at this point .",
    "the angular distribution of the momentum @xmath57 in collimated protostellar winds can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 labels directions relative to the wind axis , and @xmath60 is a force distribution normalized such that @xmath61 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that any hydromagnetic protostellar wind should limit to a common force distribution on scales large compared to the source : @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , under the assumption of a locally momentum conserving interaction with the ambient cloud @xcite , this relation was shown to give good agreement with the observed position - velocity and mass - velocity distributions of bipolar molecular outflows . in cases where we are interested only in angles away from the axis ( @xmath64 ) , such as the disruption of a protostellar core by its wind (  [ s : coredisruption ] ) , equation ( [ eq : pmuhydromag ] )",
    "simplifies to , @xmath65 the dependence @xmath66 is caused by the balance of magnetic stresses in the wind at large distances from its source , as in the model of @xcite .",
    "deviations from this power - law relationship can be caused by variations of the conserved variables across streamlines ( e.g. , because of differences in initial disk radius ) , but these deviations are typically quite small .",
    "the broadening angle @xmath67 could be the result of a wandering of the jet , internal shocks from variations in the wind velocity , or hydromagnetic instabilities ; @xcite estimated @xmath68 on the basis of comparisons with observations .",
    "the wind momentum @xmath57 is the product of the wind velocity @xmath69 and the wind mass @xmath11 , which itself is a fraction @xmath70 of the final mass @xmath14 of the protostar that drives the wind .",
    "therefore the net wind momentum is @xmath71 we shall assume for simplicity that @xmath72 does not depend on @xmath14 .",
    "this assumption is justified in the x - wind model @xcite by the insensitivity of both @xmath16 and @xmath73 to the details of the accretion . in this model , @xmath16 is set by the geometry of field lines in a very small region around the disk truncation radius .",
    "also , deuterium burning introduces a thermostat that maintains the escape velocity from the stellar surface near a constant value @xcite , and the ratio between @xmath73 and the escape velocity is insensitive to the star s mass , magnetization and accretion rate .",
    "@xcite argue that the model of @xcite implies @xmath74 if one takes the average wind luminosity to be half its final value . for a wind velocity of @xmath75 ,",
    "this implies @xmath76 , between the predictions @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the original x - wind @xcite and disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) theories , respectively .",
    "the wind momentum output may vary rapidly , but it declines in intensity over a wind or accretion time scale @xmath79 , which is generally taken to be about @xmath80 years .",
    "there is little observational evidence that @xmath79 varies with @xmath14 ; argue for an exponential decline in outflow intensity , on a time scale of @xmath81 , throughout their sample of class 0 and i protostars .",
    "thus , for star - forming clumps less dense than @xmath82 , whose free - fall times are longer than @xmath80 years , it is clearly a good approximation to consider the deposition of an outflow s momentum as impulsive ( @xmath83 ) .    what happens at higher densities ?",
    "the duration of an intense protostellar wind is identical to the time scale of accretion onto the protostar .",
    "this in turn is essentially identical to the duration of accretion onto the combined star - disk system , for a stable accretion disk can not hold most of the total mass @xcite . finally , this accretion time in a magnetized core is roughly twice the thermal crossing time of the protostellar core if ambipolar diffusion is not considered @xcite , and less if it is @xcite ; thus , the accretion and dynamical times in a protostellar core are similar .",
    "but , the dynamical time of a protostellar core is shorter than that of a molecular clump if the former is an overdense region within the latter .",
    "therefore , we shall assume that protostellar winds are always impulsive events compared to the dynamical time of the parent star - forming clump , even for mean clump densities above @xmath84 .",
    "this assumption , which remains to be tested by observations , will simplify our analysis of the efficiency of stellar cluster formation in ",
    "[ s : clumps ] .",
    "to estimate the amount of mass ejected from either a protostellar core or a star - forming clump we approximate the shocked wind and cloud material as a thin shell whose motion is purely radial .",
    "in other words , neither mass nor momentum is mixed between angular sectors , and there is no lateral momentum generated in the shell .",
    "these approximations were introduced by @xcite , and were shown by @xcite to reproduce the observational features of molecular outflows . for the case",
    "in which the ambient gas is not isotropic , we shall consider only the monopole component of gravity ; @xcite demonstrated that this is a viable approximation , even in the extreme case of a disk - like core .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "a fixed fraction @xmath16 of the accreted material is ejected at velocity @xmath73 in a wind with angular dependence given by equation ( [ eq : pmuhydromag ] ) .",
    "assuming thin , radiative shocks , purely radial motion and monopole gravity , we shall identify the direction ( characterized by the direction cosine @xmath85 ) in which the wind is marginally able to drive the ambient material outward at the escape velocity of the cloud .",
    "only material further toward the equator can be accreted , since the rest is ejected . and",
    ", only this accreted material is available to be reprocessed in the wind .",
    "the fraction of core material that successfully accretes will thus be determined self - consistently .    to simplify the discussion of the condition for a protostellar wind to eject gas from the cloud",
    ", we shall defer including the effect of gravity on the propagation of the shock in the cloud to the _ appendix_. in the absence of the perturbation introduced by gravity , the shell s velocity @xmath86 is set by the total emitted wind momentum and the ambient mass swept up in each direction in the direction specified by @xmath87 : @xmath88 here we have assumed that the mass and flight time of the wind can be neglected in comparison with the ambient mass and age of the outflow .",
    "this is a good assumption in directions in which @xmath89 , since the mass of the wind must be negligible if it is to drive a shock at a velocity small compared to the wind velocity @xcite .",
    "we have also neglected the effects of the ambient pressure or magnetic field , which should be a reasonably good approximation so long as the shock is traveling faster than the local signal speed . note that these perturbations are similar in magnitude to gravity if the clump is in virial equilibrium .",
    "we express the mass distribution of the ambient gas as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is normalized by @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the total mass inside @xmath94 .",
    "since @xmath95 ( eq . [ eq : dpwdomega ] ) , the equation of motion for the shell becomes @xmath96    the condition for a sector of the shocked gas to escape from the gravitational field of the cloud in which the protostar is embedded can be estimated by setting @xmath97 equal to the total momentum of the wind , @xmath98 , and by setting the shock velocity equal to the escape velocity , @xmath19 .",
    "the effects of gravity on the propagation of the shock are discussed in the _ appendix _ ; they can be incorporated by including a factor @xmath23 that is evaluated there : @xmath99 for impulsive winds ( those that last a time that is short compared to the free - fall time of the ambient cloud , @xmath100 ) , the factor @xmath101 is close to unity . for steady winds ( @xmath102 ) ,",
    "@xmath101 is proportional to the ratio @xmath103 : only the momentum transferred during a free - fall time is effective in ejecting cloud material .",
    "in deriving this escape condition , we have assumed that the cloud material does not have a significant infall velocity in the region of interest ( @xmath104 ) . in the theory of @xcite ,",
    "the core material is completely at rest outside an expansion wave moving at the thermal velocity , @xmath105 . since @xmath106 , the outflow shell encounters no infall whatsoever in this direction .",
    "however , more complete theories @xcite and recent observations @xcite suggest an inflow velocity intermediate between the ambipolar drift velocity and the isothermal sound speed .",
    "this is still significantly slower than @xmath19 , justifying our approximation that material upstream of the outflow shell is motionless in the direction of interest .",
    "to evaluate the escape condition ( eq .",
    "[ eq : esc ] ) , we introduce the efficiency parameter @xmath33 defined in equation ( [ eq : defx ] ) and use the expression for @xmath60 in equation ( [ eq : pmuhydromag ] ) : @xmath107 numerically , we have @xmath108    the mass ejected from the cloud by the protostellar wind is the sum of the swept - up cloud mass inside @xmath109 and the wind mass inside @xmath109 : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the fraction of the wind momentum retained in the cloud ; we assume that @xmath73 is independent of @xmath87 and also that the shocked wind is dynamically cold , in which case @xmath112 is also the fraction of the wind mass that is retained .",

    "neither cloud nor wind mass is ejected if @xmath117 , since @xmath118 if the outflow does not reach the surface of the cloud ; according to equation ( [ eq : muesca ] ) , this occurs at a stellar mass @xmath119 for @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , it follows that @xmath123 , so that most stars are more massive than @xmath124 .",

    "note that if @xmath127 , then the amount of mass ejected from the cloud is directly proportional to the amount of mass converted into stars .",
    "the resulting star formation efficiency for an isotropic cloud is @xmath128 for @xmath126 ; for @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 . weakening the wind or increasing the escape velocity ( i.e. , increasing @xmath33 ) increases the stellar mass @xmath124 that can not eject any material . for a star with @xmath131 ,",
    "it causes less material to be ejected : hence @xmath132 increases with @xmath33 ( as in equation [ [ eq : oneovermuesc ] ] ) .",
    "this also reduces the amount of wind mass lost : therefore , @xmath112 increases with @xmath33 . as a result",

    "since the wind is strongly concentrated toward the axis according to equation ( [ eq : pmuhydromag ] ) , it follows that the fraction of the wind material that is retained by the core is generally small , @xmath135 .",

    "then , @xmath222 thus , over the mass range in which the core mass function is a power law and the star formation efficiency is determined by outflows , the slope of the imf is expected quite generally to be just slightly flatter than than that of the protostellar cores .",
    "this theory does not address the imf of high - mass stars , nor of cores sufficiently turbulent for fragmentation to occur during their collapse .",
    "although the above argument assumes a constant value of @xmath154 among cores , the result that the imf is very close in slope to the core mass function is independent of this assumption .",

    "the two slopes can not differ greatly if the stellar mass is always within a factor of three of the core mass .",
    "features in the core mass function ( such as a peak ) appear in the imf at a mass that is smaller by the factor @xmath42 .",
    "we have adopted a scenario in which a protostellar core is destroyed simultaneously by accretion onto a central star ( near the equator ) and by protostellar outflow ( near the poles ) .",

    "this geometry is confirmed by observations of the irs 2 outflow source in barnard 5 @xcite , which clearly discern an equatorial inflow coexisting with an axial outflow .",
    "although we have not calculated the outflow structure in detail , the current theory implies the existence of a massive , slow , conical outflow that reaches the core escape velocity at about @xmath224 from the equator for the fiducial values of the parameters .",
    "this structure , which also appears in the theory of @xcite , is likely to correspond to the massive , poorly collimated , @xmath225 biconical outflow observed around t tauri by @xcite .",

    "thus , we expect that spherical cores will lose three - quarters of their mass while forming a star , whereas cores at the upper end of the acceptable range of flattening @xcite will lose only a quarter of their mass .",
    "the stellar initial mass function therefore depends not only on the mass function for cores , but also on the relative degrees of flattening of low and high - mass cores , and on changes of cores line widths with mass .",

    "a further difference between clumps and cores is that since the clumps contain the cores , the cores are generally significantly denser than the clumps in which they are embedded , and their free - fall times are correspondingly shorter .",
    "insofar as the accretion time ( and therefore @xmath179 ) is tied to the free - fall time , as in inside - out collapse models for star formation @xcite , it follows that the star formation occurs on a time scale shorter than the free - fall time of the clump . in this case",
    ", the effect of gravity on the shell s motion , which is characterized by the factor @xmath101 ( eq . [ eq : shelldeltaescape ] ) , is relatively minor : @xmath234 which is of order unity for @xmath235 .",

    "an escape velocity of order @xmath252 leads to @xmath253 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : epsilond ] ) assumes that the mass ejected by each outflow can be tallied independently of other outflows .",
    "this can be verified by considering two outflows that occur simultaneously , which maximizes their interaction .",
    "if the angle between their axes is significantly greater than @xmath109 for either , then the momentum output from each is negligible within an angle @xmath109 of the other s axis . then , @xmath10 is given by equation ( [ eq : mej ] ) for each outflow individually .",
    "alternatively , consider the case in which the outflows are completely aligned .",
    "they would then act as a single outflow whose momentum ( and wind mass , assuming identical values of @xmath73 ) is the sum of its two components .",
    "so long as the combined mass of stars that forms simultaneously is still much less than @xmath254 , so that our assumption @xmath255 still holds , equation ( [ eq : mej ] ) shows that @xmath10 is then the sum of the values it would take for each outflow individually . in either case , and thus quite generally , the relative timing and orientation of outflows is of little importance when estimating the mass they eject .",
    "we wish to assess the accuracy of equation ( [ eq : epsilond ] ) , in which we assumed that each star forms at the exact center of its clump . in this section ,",
    "we present calculations of @xmath36 for off - center star formation . as above",
    ", we assume that the clump is spherically symmetric with @xmath256 ; we set @xmath257 .",

    "we take stars to be formed in the clump at a local rate @xmath260 equal to the ambipolar diffusion rate @xmath261 , as in the photoionization - regulation model of @xcite . because @xmath262 if cosmic - ray ionization prevails , we take the star formation rate to vary with the free - fall rate in the region of high extinction .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion rate decreases sharply due to far - ultraviolet ionization as the visual extinction to the surface @xmath263 falls below about four magnitudes .",
    "although this transition can be described analytically @xcite , for simplicity we shall take the transition to be sudden : @xmath264 if @xmath265 and @xmath266 if @xmath267 .    for each star ,",
    "a grid of solid angles is constructed around its outflow axis .",
    "the wind momentum is distributed on this grid , whose resolution is concentrated toward the axis for improved numerical accuracy .",
    "the clump mass per solid angle is also computed , using the distance from the newborn star to the center of the clump , and using the angle between its axis and the radial direction .",
    "the ratio between @xmath268 and @xmath269 gives the shell velocity at the clump surface ; this is compared to @xmath270 , and the total ejected mass is tallied .",
    "thus , the effect of gravity is included as an overall factor , rather than considered in the motion of each outflow element .    in figure",
    "[ fig : clumpeffic ] , we compare the results of this numerical investigation to our analytical formulae . allowing for distributed star formation and averaging over the initial mass function changes the estimated efficiencies appreciably only when the assumption @xmath271 breaks down ( near the thin lines that represent these limits in figure [ fig : clumpeffic ] ) .",
    "for instance , the curvature of the numerical contours of @xmath36 away from the analytical contours at the bottom of the plot can be attributed to the smallness of @xmath272 in that region .",
    "we have also compared to a calculation of @xmath36 that averages over the stellar initial mass function but assumes each star forms at the center : this reproduces the off - center calculation almost exactly , except for @xmath273 . in general , assuming that each star forms at the center yields an excellent approximation of the star formation efficiency .",
    "the above theory implies that the clumps that give rise to clusters of low - mass stars , like those in l1630 ( @xmath274 , @xmath275 ; * ? ? ?",

    "this assumption is relatively uncertain due to variable extinction in the area , luminosity variation in the embedded sources , and the completeness limit of the survey .",
    "if instead each source signified the mean stellar mass ( @xmath283 ) , the inferred efficiencies would be about a factor of two lower .",
    "a direct comparison with theory is therefore difficult for both theoretical and experimental reasons , but it is encouraging that there is rough agreement for the richer clusters , which may be more evolved .",
    "@xcite have conducted a survey in taurus for dense gas and young stellar objects in various phases of evolution , in order to ascertain the evolutionary sequence leading to cluster formation .",
    "they find that only those clumps ( and _ all _ those clumps ) with mean visual extinction @xmath284 are actively forming stars , in agreement with the theoretical prediction of @xcite .",
    "however , some clumps of lower extinction contain more evolved objects that presumably formed while the column density was above this threshold . considering the decrease in column density to correspond to a loss of gas mass , and multiplying by the mean area per star",
    ", these authors estimate that about @xmath285 is lost per observed object , i.e. , @xmath286 if each object represents @xmath287 of stellar material .",
    "this observational determination of efficiency is also quite uncertain .",
    "it should be considered a lower limit for several reasons : the stellar sample is likely to miss a significant fraction of weak - line t tauri stars @xcite ; stars may have drifted away from the older clumps ; and the decrease in column density could be partly due to an expansion of the clumps over time . moreover , the currently star - forming clumps have not created their full complement of stars : on average , one might expect about half the stars to have been born by now , in which case @xmath288 .",
    "the star - forming clumps in this sample have escape velocities ranging from @xmath289 to @xmath290 , for which we estimate @xmath291 from equation ( [ eq : epsilond ] ) . again , the theory predicts efficiencies similar to the values inferred from observation .",
    "the star formation efficiency is a fundamental property of the process of star formation .",
    "star formation is often said to be inefficient because it occurs much more slowly than it potentially could , as discussed in the introduction . however , when defined in terms of the fraction of the available mass that goes into stars , it is rather high  at least for low - mass stars . for such stars , the efficiency is determined by the powerful protostellar winds that accompany the formation of the star .",
    "these winds produce a total momentum per unit mass of star formed of order @xmath292 .",
    "if this momentum were transferred to the surrounding gas isotropically , then the mass ejected would be much greater than the mass that goes into the star , and the efficiency would be low ( nakano et al 1995 ) .",
    "in fact , however , protostellar winds are highly collimated . to determine the star formation efficiency resulting from collimated outflows",
    ", we assumed : ( 1 ) the interaction between the protostellar wind and the ambient gas is mediated by thin , radiative shocks that lead to radial outflow ; ( 2 ) except possibly near the wind axis , the mass of the wind is small compared with the mass swept up by the wind shock ; and ( 3 ) there is an angle @xmath109 relative to the wind axis inside of which all mass is ejected and outside of which mass can accrete toward the central source , with a fraction @xmath293 going into the protostellar wind .",
    "assumptions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are consistent with observations of the momentum distribution in protostellar outflows @xcite .",
    "we additionally assumed ( 4 ) that @xmath294 is the same among stars of different masses .",
    "this assumption , which is justified by the fact that deuterium burning regulates protostars escape velocity @xcite and thus the wind velocity @xcite , leads to an estimate of the star formation efficiency that is the same for most stars and depends only on the escape velocity of the region ( eq . [ [ eq : epsilond ] ] ) .",
    "if this assumption did not hold , @xmath36 would vary among stars .",
    "however the conclusions of   [ s : clumps ] would still be valid , as the star formation efficiency for a clump is an average over the imf .",
    "the principal effect of wind collimation on the momentum transfer to the ambient gas is to concentrate the momentum in a mass that is smaller than in the isotropic case by a factor of order @xmath295 , where @xmath27 is the size of the central region of the outflow ( eq . [ eq : pmuhydromag ] ) .",
    "gas is ejected if its velocity exceeds the escape velocity , @xmath19 ; as a result , the mass ejected is given by @xmath296 .",
    "if the ejected mass is larger than the protostellar mass , then the star formation efficiency is approximately @xmath297 this result , which applies both to the formation of individual stars in a core or the formation of a cluster of stars in a star - forming clump , shows that the efficiency of formation of low - mass stars is    * independent of the mass of the star ; and * only weakly dependent on the properties of the core or clump , through @xmath298 .",
    "consequently , the efficiency is only weakly dependent on the geometry of the star - forming region and the location of the outflow source within it , as the results of   [ s : coredisruption ] and [ s : numerics ] demonstrate .",
    "these conclusions are in qualitative agreement with those of @xcite , but our inclusion of the collimation of the outflows increases the estimated star formation efficiency by about an order of magnitude , so that @xmath299 .    we have evaluated the star formation efficiency separately for protostellar cores and for star - forming clumps .",
    "protostellar cores are expected to be flattened in a direction perpendicular to the outflow ; since the outflow and inflow are in different directions , the star formation efficiency is increased over the case of an isotropic ambient medium .",
    "we evaluated this effect quantitatively using the li - shu ( 1996 ) model of isothermal , magnetized protostellar cores ( see fig .",
    "because @xmath36 is independent of the stellar mass and only weakly dependent on the core mass , we predict ( in agreement with nakano et al 1995 ) that the initial mass function is just slightly flatter than the mass distribution of protostellar cores , with a power - law index @xmath300 .",
    "our model differs from most previous proposals in that the wind acts to limit the fraction of the mass that can accrete , but does not cause accretion to shut off entirely .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that accretion is necessary to drive a powerful wind .",
    "instead , accretion terminates because only a finite reservoir of gas is available .",
    "in contrast to the proposal of @xcite , for instance , the angle dividing accreted and ejected material takes a characteristic value during the main accretion phase .",
    "variations of @xmath185 may result from a decline in the accretion rate , but do not cause it .",
    "another distinction of the theory presented here is that the division between accretion and ejection occurs in swept - up material traveling outward at the escape velocity  material outside the region of significant infall and far outside the centrifugal radius .",
    "therefore the complicated interaction among outflow , infall and rotation , which determines the shape of the outflow cavity at its base , does not affect the efficiency .",
    "all of the material at the base of the flow is destined to accrete , for rotational flattening and infall only act to lessen the effect of the wind .",
    "we have found that the star formation efficiency is controlled by the efficiency parameter @xmath33 ( equation  [ [ eq : defx ] ] ) , and in the case of magnetically flattened protostellar cores , also by the flattening parameter @xmath149 .",
    "the factors that introduce uncertainty into the theory are primarily those that affect @xmath33 .",
    "for instance , the factor @xmath101 that corrects for the effect of gravity on the outflow motions is well - understood for clumps of hydrogen number density below @xmath301 , in which winds are impulsive . as we discuss in  [ s : wind - structure - duration ] , we expect that winds are approximately impulsive for higher mean densities as well ; however , the accuracy of this approximation is difficult to assess . for the formation of an individual star ,",
    "the wind duration is longer than the free - fall time of the core .",
    "this raises the question , addressed in ",
    "[ s : g+steady ] of the appendix , of what happens to material when it reaches the core s surface .",
    "the results presented in ",
    "[ s : coredisruption ] presume that the shocked shell decouples from the wind outside the core ; however , equation ( [ eq : shellsteadyescape ] ) shows that @xmath101 would be three times lower in the opposite limit of perfect coupling .",
    "a second source of uncertainty is the parameter @xmath294 that relates a star s final mass to the momentum of its wind . as discussed in ",
    "[ s : wind - structure - duration ] , our value , @xmath302 , is consistent with current observational and theoretical estimates ; however , both are somewhat uncertain .",
    "our estimate of the effective broadening angle , @xmath67 , of protostellar winds is also not precise .",

    "note that @xmath67 enters logarithmically in the efficiency parameter @xmath33 , as @xmath303 ; therefore , we consider it a minor source of uncertainty as compared to @xmath294 .",
    "however , because the intensity of protostellar winds along their axes is proportional to @xmath304 , this parameter plays a more important role in determining the minimum stellar mass @xmath124 capable of ejecting any mass . the efficiency increases dramatically ( and equation [ [ eq : epsilond ] ] breaks down ) for clump masses large enough that @xmath124 becomes comparable to the mean stellar mass . for @xmath305 ,",
    "this happens when @xmath306 ( the upper thin line in figure [ fig : clumpeffic ] ) .",
    "another condition for the validity of our theory is that massive stars do not dominate the ejection of mass ; as shown by the dash - dot line in that figure , we expect that to happen when @xmath307 . thus for @xmath305 , the former is the more restrictive criterion ; if @xmath67 were greater than about @xmath308 , the latter would be .",
    "lastly , we expect that the assumption of radial motion is not perfect .",
    "most likely , this implies that our estimate of @xmath33 should be adjusted by a correction factor of order unity .    for star - forming clumps",
    ", we found that the star - formation efficiency is typically somewhat less than 0.5 , although slight variations in the parameters can bring @xmath36 above 0.5 .",
    "as discussed in  [ s : intro : clumps ] , such high efficiencies might be expected to leave the cluster gravitationally bound . to show why most clusters are unbound , we must consider the dynamics of cluster formation , a topic we address in a future paper .",

    "because @xmath19 marks the boundary between ejected and retained material , and because gravity is important for the dynamics of a shell if its mean velocity is about @xmath19 , we wish to refine our estimate of the escape criterion accounting for gravity .",
    "assume that a star forms at the center of the clump , and that the clump s gravitational potential is not perturbed by the passage of the outflow .",
    "take the distribution of momentum injection to vary with angle away from the outflow axis as @xmath309 our model for @xmath60 is given in equation ( [ eq : dpwdomega ] ) .",
    "we take the distribution of clump density to be @xmath310 for @xmath311 , where the normalization of the angular distribution of the density is @xmath312 .",
    "the mass per unit solid angle enclosed within radius @xmath94 is therefore @xmath313 where the total mass inside @xmath94 is @xmath314 , and @xmath315 .    to determine the condition for the wind to eject material from the surrounding clump or core , we make several approximations (  [ s : mass ] ) : we assume radial , momentum - conserving flow , and we neglect @xmath316 compared with @xmath269 in regions in which the velocity of the shell is small compared with the wind velocity , @xmath317 . in addition , we adopt the monopole approximation for gravity , which is generally quite good , even for flattened distributions @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a sector of the shell is then @xmath318 or @xmath319 where we have divided through by @xmath151 . in the monopole approximation ,",
    "the kinematics of the shocked shell depend only on the ratio @xmath320 , not on either one independently .    if we neglect the effect of gravity on the propagation of the shock , as in the main text , equation ( [ eq : vmdot ] ) integrates to give @xmath321 usually , we shall adopt the criterion that a sector of the shell will escape from the clump if its velocity exceeds the escape velocity .",
    "the critical angle at which escape is marginally possible , @xmath322 , is then determined by setting @xmath323 , the total wind momentum , and @xmath324 in equation ( [ eq : mvs ] ) .",
    "including the effect of gravity on the dynamics of the shell increases the required momentum by a factor @xmath23 that we shall determine below : @xmath325    to solve for the dynamics of the shock in the clump including the effects of gravity , we express @xmath326 as @xmath327 and @xmath328 as @xmath329 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : shellmotion ] ) then becomes @xmath330 we now introduce the variables @xmath331 and @xmath332 ; in terms of these variables , equation ( [ eq : shellmotion2 ] ) becomes @xmath333 integrating , and transforming back to radius and velocity from @xmath334 and @xmath335 , we find @xmath336 where we have defined @xmath337 as the local escape velocity [ so that @xmath338 , and @xmath339 is a constant of integration .",

[ eq : pqp ] ) .      next ,",
    "consider what happens if the wind momentum injection is constant throughout the expansion of the shell , so that @xmath351 maintains the steady value @xmath352 .",
    "furthermore , let us suppose that the wind continues to inject momentum after the shell breaks out of the clump .",
    "then , a nave estimate for the criterion for escape is that the wind force overcome gravity at the clump surface , @xmath353 this estimate gives @xmath354 for the factor by which the momentum in the wind must be enhanced to overcome the effects of gravity on the shell dynamics .",
    "this factor is large when @xmath355 since only the momentum delivered in a time of order @xmath3 is effective in ejecting the shell .",
    "in fact , the condition @xmath23 sets a lower bound on the value of @xmath103 for a steady wind .",
    "consider the dynamics of the outflow shell after it has broken free of the clump , so that its mass is constant",
    ". then , since we are assuming that @xmath356 is constant in time , we can integrate equation ( [ eq : vmdot ] ) directly , using @xmath357 : @xmath358 where @xmath359 is the energy of the shell and @xmath360 is its energy at the clump surface .",
    "if the wind were no longer blowing , the shell s energy would be constant and positive energy ( @xmath361 ) would lead to escape .",
    "however , we are assuming that the wind continues to blow well past the time that the shocked shell reaches the clump surface . in this case",
    ", the shell might escape even if it has negative energy , because of the wind force .",
    "( below , we shall consider the case that the outflow decouples from the wind after breaking out . )",
    "we shall evaluate @xmath362 using equation ( [ eq : shellmotion3 ] ) , and then use equation ( [ eq : shelloutsideclump ] ) to determine the criterion for escape .",
    "we readily see that @xmath363 for a steady wind , for all the other terms in equation ( [ eq : shellmotion3 ] ) are zero at the origin ; therefore , @xmath364 using the value of @xmath360 from this in equation ( [ eq : shelloutsideclump ] ) , and requiring that @xmath365 [ so that @xmath366 for all @xmath94 , we find the critical value of the wind force : @xmath367^{1/2 }   \\right\\}^2   \\times \\frac{\\pi{t_{w}}}{4{t_{\\rm ff } } } { m_{\\rm cl}}{v_{\\rm esc}}.\\ ] ] this more precise wind force criterion is @xmath368 and @xmath369 lower than the simple estimate of equation ( [ eq : shellsteadyestimate ] ) for @xmath370 and @xmath236 , respectively .",
    "the two agree exactly for @xmath181 , because gravity and wind force scale in the same manner inside the clump in that case .",
    "this implies that the shell velocity at the surface vanishes if the wind force equals the critical value if @xmath181 , exactly as we assumed in estimate ( [ eq : shellsteadyestimate ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : shellsteadyestimate ] )  ( [ eq : shellsteadyescape ] ) assume that the wind continues to deposit momentum into the shell efficiently , even after the outflow has emerged from the clump .",
    "there are two reasons that this assumption may be incorrect , which make the above estimates lower limits for the critical wind force .",
    "first , if @xmath79 is not too much longer than @xmath3 , there is the possibility that the wind force will taper off before the shell has achieved escape velocity .",
    "second , there is the possibility that the shell will be disrupted by a thin - shell instability .",
    "the former effect can be ignored , because it is only important when @xmath371 .",
    "the latter is more serious , as it would remove the supporting effect of the wind ( partially or completely ) once the instability set in .",
    "shock - bounded thin shells are subject to nonlinear instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these are expected to become stronger if the dense fluid ( the ambient gas , in this case ) is `` upward '' , i.e. , if the shell accelerates , or at least decelerates more slowly than gravity would predict ( e. t. vishniac , private communication ) . writing out @xmath372 as @xmath373 and @xmath374 as @xmath375 , we find from equation ( [ eq : shellmotion ] ) that the difference between the actual acceleration and gravity is @xmath376 since gravity is an additive term in the acceleration , we see that the shell decelerates more slowly than gravity would predict ( and is unstable ) if the same shell would accelerate , were gravity suddenly turned off .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rtdiscriminant ] ) shows that this only occurs if the ram pressure in the wind exceeds the ram pressure of the ambient gas . for a steady wind",
    ", this requires that the ambient medium must steepen so that @xmath377 ( declining winds would require even steeper profiles ) .",
    "we therefore expect that shells might become partially decoupled from their winds as they emerge from a clump , not before .",
    "although this instability is nonlinear , and may be suppressed by magnetic fields in the outflow shell or in the wind , we can obtain an upper limit to the critical wind force if we assume that outflows decouple entirely from their winds after breakout .",
    "then , the criterion for ejection is once again @xmath378 . from equation ( [ eq : shellsteadymotion ] )",
    ", this requires @xmath379 the factor @xmath101 in this case is the coefficient of @xmath380 in the equation above .",
    "we see that the wind force required to eject the shell is much stronger if the shell decouples from the wind after breakout than if the wind continues to provide support , the factor between equations ( [ eq : shellsteadyescape ] ) and ( [ eq : shellsteadyescape2 ] ) being seven or three if @xmath381 is zero or two , respectively ."
