    "<S> we study the quasi - long - range ordered phase of a 2d xy model with quenched site - dilution using the spin - wave approximation and expansion in the parameter which characterizes the deviation from completely homogeneous dilution . </S>",
    "<S> the results , obtained by keeping the terms up to the third order in the expansion , show good accordance with monte carlo data in a wide range of dilution concentrations far enough from the percolation threshold . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss different types of expansion .    </S>",

    "<S> 75.10 general theory and models of magnetic ordering    the xy model in two dimensions is the simplest example of a system exhibiting  quasi - long - range order \" ( qlro ) , which appears at low temperatures in a number of physical models of great importance , e.g. magnetic films with planar anisotropy , but also thin - film superfluids or superconductors , two - dimensional solids , 2d - classical coulomb gas or fluctuating surfaces and the roughness transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although no exact solution exists for this model , most of its properties are known from different approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> destruction of long range ordering is due to the presence of stable topological defects ( vortices )  @xcite , a situation which strongly contrasts with usual ordering in systems undergoing a ferromagnetic phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> first , the magnetization of the xy model on an infinite 2d lattice remains zero at any non - zero temperature  @xcite , thus it is impossible to describe in the thermodynamic limit the quasi - long - range ordered phase by this usual order parameter , however the spin - spin pair correlation function gives a distinct indication of qlro . </S>",
    "<S> its asymptotic behaviour changes from exponential at high temperatures to power low decay at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is referred to as the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition and the point where this change of behaviour occurs is the bkt temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantity of interest which characterizes the qlro phase , is then the temperature dependent exponent of the correlation function : @xmath1 the spin - wave analysis of the model gives a reliable value of @xmath2 for small enough temperatures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the harmonic approximation for this model is grounded by the rg analysis  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of the ( classical ) xy model on a regular lattice ( without defects ) @xmath3 has been studied intensively ( when @xmath4 is limited to nearest neighbours ) and its properties are well known ( see e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of defects ( site - dilution , bond - dilution ) has been considered as a trivial modification , since the harris criterion @xcite states in this case that the universality class of the diluted model remains the same as that of the pure one . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the critical exponents of both pure and disordered models are unchanged , when evaluated at their corresponding bkt points , e.g. @xmath5 , but the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 characterizing the low temperature phase of pure and disordered systems are different and the exact behaviour of @xmath7 is a question which deserves attention . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is not obvious how the impurities can interact with the vortices and influence the qlro . </S>",
    "<S> this question is addressed e.g. in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in a previous paper  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the influence of uncorrelated ( normally distributed ) site - dilution was considered and a perturbation expansion for the case of weak dilution was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the two - spin coupling term @xmath4 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqh_pure ] ) was replaced by @xmath8 with @xmath9 the physical quantities which characterize the system with quenched disorder after the thermodynamical averaging must be averaged over all possible configurations of dilution . </S>",
    "<S> this configurational averaging is denoted as @xmath10 : @xmath11( ... </S>",
    "<S> ),\\label{eq - confavg}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the concentration of occupied sites .    </S>",
    "<S> starting with the hamiltonian in the harmonic approximation , @xmath13 and realizing the fourier transformation of the variables : @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the number of sites in the lattice , and @xmath16 runs over the 1st brillouin zone ) , one has @xmath17\\theta_{\\bf k } \\theta_{\\bf k'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 = 2-\\cos k_xa-\\cos k_ya$ ] on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the first term is the hamiltonian of the pure system , so one can consider @xmath20 as a parameter of perturbation of this hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> note , that power of @xmath20 corresponds to the number of sums over @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> a classification of the perturbation theory series with respect to number of sums over @xmath16 corresponds to the expansion in the ratio of the volume of effective interaction to the elementary cell volume @xcite . taking this ratio to be small means that it is valid for the short - range interacting systems , which holds for our problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the linear approximation in @xmath20-expansion presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite gives the result for the exponent of the pair correlation function : @xmath21 here we can report the result for this expansion up to the second order in @xmath20 : @xmath22 the figures follow from numerical estimate of sums . </S>",
    "<S> the 1st and 2nd order perturbation expressions fit the monte carlo results only for very small concentrations of dilution ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the calculation of the third order seems to be too tedious and perhaps does not deserve so much effort , therefore it is desirable to investigate another road .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose to introduce the parameter of expansion in a different manner in order to extend the region of reliability of the expansion to stronger dilutions ( but of course still far enough from the percolation threshold where the whole approach fails ) and to improve convergence . </S>",
    "<S> we will keep the notation @xmath20 , but from now on one should understand it as the deviation from homogeneously diluted system : @xmath23 we did not make any assumption about weakness of disorder , we may thus expect that the results of this expansion will be less sensitive to the value of dilution @xmath12 . rewriting the hamiltonian with this new parameter one gets @xmath24\\theta_{\\bf k } \\theta_{\\bf k'}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & c^2 h_{{{\\rm pure } } } + h_{\\rho } + h_{\\rho^2}\\ , \\label{eq - hamdilute}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is the hamiltonian of the pure system now with a renormalized coupling .    the spin - spin pair correlation function , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 can be expanded in @xmath20 and then configurationally averaged . in ( [ 14 ] ) , @xmath26 stands for the averaging with the pure system hamiltonian with renormalized coupling @xmath27 . using ( [ eq - confavg ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one has the equalities : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which , inserted into the expansion lead after tedious calculations to the third order expression @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq - correl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath32 , @xmath33 we have found for the sums in ( [ eq - correl ] ) : @xmath34 the figures @xmath35 and @xmath36 come from numerical summation . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that to zeroth - order , the change of exponent comes from a renormalization of the coupling strength , the first - order term is identically vanishing . for small enough temperatures </S>",
    "<S> it is now possible to write the pair correlation function in the power law form : @xmath37 reminding the correlation function exponent of the pure system in the sw approximation , @xmath38 , we can write @xmath39 the first term in the brackets , @xmath40 , corresponds to the zeroth order in the expansion , the first - order term is identically vanishing as was already noted before , the second and third terms in the brackets correspond to the second- and third - order terms in the @xmath20-expansion respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> [ th ]   are indicated in the legend ) . </S>",
    "<S> expressions  ( [ old1st ] ) and ( [ old2nd ] ) of the previous expansion are shown ( thin lines ) for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> insert shows the vicinity of the pure system.,title=\"fig:\",width=510 ]    -0 cm    in order to check these expressions , simulations of 2d xy - spins are performed using wolff s cluster monte carlo algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low - temperature phase being critical , local updates of single spins would suffer from the critical slowing down . </S>",
    "<S> implemented in the case of the xy model , the wolff algorithm first introduces bonds through the ising variables defined by the sign of the projection of the spin variables along some random direction . </S>",
    "<S> then clusters of sites are built by a bond percolation process ( here the random graph model of the fortuin - kasteleyn representation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the percolation threshold for these bonds coincides with the kosterlitz - thouless point  @xcite , which guarantees the efficiency of the wolff cluster updating scheme  @xcite at @xmath41 . in the low - temperature phase </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in , this algorithm could be less efficient , but nevertheless preferable to a local updating , since the correlation length is diverging . using this procedure , </S>",
    "<S> we discard typically @xmath42 sweeps for thermalization , and the measurements are performed on typically @xmath42 production sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> averages over disorder are performed using typically @xmath43 samples . </S>",
    "<S> there is no need of a better statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions are chosen periodic and the critical exponent @xmath44 of the correlation function is measured indirectly through the finite - size scaling behaviour of the magnetization m_t(l)~l^-x_(t),x_(t)=12(t ) , where the last scaling relations holds in two dimensions .    in figure  [ fig1 ] , we compare the 0th to 3rd order expansions ( remember that the 1rd order term vanishes ) with the mc data . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is quite good using the expansion parameter  ( [ eqrho ] ) which provides a clear improvement of the previous expansion given by expressions  ( [ old1st ] ) and ( [ old2nd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course the question of the next order is not settled , but now we are on the way to counting higher orders or even summing the whole series . another direction of future work would be to implement the same type of perturbation expansion within the villain model  @xcite and to explore the deconfining transition of the diluted model . </S>"
