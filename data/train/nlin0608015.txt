    "in recent work , we presented experimental and simulation results for two mutually coupled lasers @xcite with time - delayed asymmetric coupling .",
    "the light emitted from one laser propagates through fiber - optic cables to a photodetector that generates an electronic signal proportional to the light - intensity deviations from steady state . the electronic signal may be attenuated or amplified before it modulates the pump current of the other laser .",
    "the propagation time of the signal in the optoelectronic path introduces a significant time delay , and the coupling strength in each direction can be controlled separately . our work in @xcite",
    "investigated how the time delay and asymmetric coupling led to oscillatory and pulsating laser output . in this paper , we present a more theoretical exploration of the dynamics that result from this coupling configuration .",
    "in @xcite we investigated this same configuration ( asymmetric pump coupling ) but without including the effect of delay .",
    "in addition , the coupling constant from laser-2 to laser-1 was negative , while the coupling constant from laser-1 to laser-2 was positive .",
    "that is , we assumed that the electronic coupling signal from laser-2 was inverted before applying it to the pump of laser-1 . for purely harmonic signals , having opposite - sign coupling constants",
    "is equivalent to time - delayed coupling when the delay is half of the period .",
    "we found that as the coupling constant from laser-2 to laser-1 is increased in magnitude : ( i ) there is a hopf bifurcation to oscillatory output .",
    "( ii ) for certain parameter values there exists a small - coupling resonance such that the amplitudes of both lasers are pulsating .",
    "( iii ) for large coupling , laser-2 acts as a small - amplitude , nearly harmonic modulation to laser-1 .",
    "laser-1 exhibits period - doubling bifurcations to chaos and complex subharmonic resonances .    in this paper",
    "we include the effect of the delayed - coupling , which results in a coupled set of delay - differential equations ( ddes ) .",
    "with delay there is again a hopf bifurcation to oscillatory output .",
    "however , the delay allows for periodic oscillations not just at the laser s relaxation period as in @xcite , but at periods that are integer multiples of the delay ; we refer to the former oscillatory solutions as  internal modes , \" and the latter as  external modes .",
    "\" we show that as the coupling strength is increased , the first instability is a hopf bifurcation to the internal mode .",
    "our nonlinear analysis then shows that the amplitude of the internal mode varies as the one - fourth root of the bifurcation parameter s deviation from the hopf bifurcation point .",
    "however , in the experiments of @xcite the output was not the internal mode but an external mode .",
    "the period of the oscillatory output was a multiple of the delay , and the amplitude of the oscillations varied as the square root of the bifurcation parameter .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the fact that the optoelectronic coupling contains an intrinsic low - pass filter that attenuates the internal mode .",
    "we show that the filter selects the external mode with the greatest possible frequency passed by the low - pass filter .",
    "a nonlinear analysis then shows that the amplitude of the external modes does indeed vary with a square - root power law .    for the coupled lasers without delay in @xcite",
    ", we found that the parameters could be tuned to cause a resonance - type effect with respect to the coupling ; more specifically , the coupling could be tuned to maximize the amplitude of the oscillatory output .",
    "we find that this resonance effect also occurs with the inclusion of the delay .",
    "however , there are some dramatic qualitative differences as the coupling parameters are varied . in the system with delay",
    ", the branch of periodic solutions in the bifurcation diagram can be smoothly folded to form parameter intervals of bi - stability .",
    "then there is a critical value of the same coupling parameter beyond which the bi - stability disappears suddenly and non - smoothly .",
    "our coupling scheme is an example of `` incoherent coupling '' @xcite because it depends only on the laser s intensity and not on the complex electric field .",
    "this is because the intensity of one laser affects the other only indirectly ; in our case , the intensity of one laser modulates the pump current of the other . in contrast , `` coherent coupling '' refers to when the optical field of one laser is directly injected into the cavity of the other laser .",
    "analogously , a single laser with delayed and re - injected self - feedback would be called `` coherent '' feedback .",
    "semiconductor lasers with delayed coherent feedback have been extensively studied because of the their widespread application in electronics and communication systems ; there the laser s output signal may be reflected off external surfaces back into the laser .",
    "the lang - kobayashi ddes @xcite are the canonical model for semiconductor lasers with delayed self - feedback and have been used to investigate phenomena ranging from the onset of instabilities to the development of chaotic output referred to as `` coherence collapse '' ( see @xcite for a review ) . coupled sets of lang - kobayashi or related ddes are most often used to described coherently - coupled semiconductor lasers with delay",
    "two recent studies @xcite are in the same spirit as this paper as they track the number of and properties of oscillatory solutions that appear as the coupling strength is increased .",
    "the main simplification that results from considering incoherent coupling between the lasers is that neither the laser - frequency detuning nor the electric - field phase differences affect the dynamics of the coupled system @xcite .",
    "pieroux et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the electrooptical coupling we consider in this paper leads to an equivalent dynamical model as incoherent coupling .",
    "there have recently been a number of other investigations of lasers with incoherent coupling .",
    "the main focus of many of these works was on chaotic synchronization ( see @xcite and included references).two recent papers by vicente et al .",
    "@xcite consider a similar implementation of optoelectronic coupling to that we consider here , i.e. , the intensity of one laser modulates the pump current of the other .",
    "their investigation of the oscillatory solutions is mainly numerical and they discuss interesting phenomena such as amplitude quenching , frequency locking and routes to chaos .",
    "delay - coupled relaxation and limit - cycle oscillators have been the subject of many investigations ( see @xcite and their included references ) .",
    "these systems are self - oscillatory and the amplitude is often fixed by the intrinsic properties of the oscillator . in many cases",
    "the system may be reduced to a phase equation , or a system of phase equations if the oscillators are coupled @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for laser systems the amplitude is an important dynamical variable .",
    "this is because the lasers we consider are weakly damped , nearly conservative systems such that the steady state is the only asymptotically stable solution .",
    "oscillations must be induced by external mechanisms such as modulation , injection or coupling @xcite .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the oscillations is highly dependent upon the external mechanism , in our case the coupling , rather than the individual laser . we should mention that for coupled limit - cycle oscillators there is the amplitude instability referred to as `` amplitude death , '' where for specific values of the coupling ( and oscillator parameter values ) the amplitude becomes zero .    after presenting our model ,",
    "we show that the linear - stability analysis predicts a critical value of the coupling constant ( that depends upon the delay time ) such that there is hopf bifurcation to the internal mode , i.e. , oscillations with the intrinsic relaxation period .",
    "we then use multiple - scale perturbation methods , modified to account for time delays @xcite , to analyze the long - time evolution of the internal mode .",
    "the results are a pair of complex stuart - landau ddes for the oscillation amplitudes that include a slow - time delay term .",
    "we analyze the amplitude equations to determine the bifurcation properties of the internal mode .",
    "of particular note is that we allow for independent control of the coupling constants ; most other studies of coupled lasers and oscillators consider symmetric coupling , where the coupling is the same across all of the elements .",
    "the independent control is important because , as we will show , it allows for a singularity in the bifurcation equations that marks the  resonance \" of large amplitude solutions .",
    "the hopf bifurcation to the internal mode occurs for small coupling .",
    "however , as the coupling is increased , the external modes appear via hopf bifurcations .",
    "we have extended our multiple - scale analysis to be able to describe the bifurcation of the external modes that occur for @xmath0 coupling .",
    "the analytical challenge is that the delay terms remain a part of the leading - order problem .",
    "describing the bifurcation of the external modes is important for comparing our results to those in experiments @xcite , because the experimental system contains low - pass filters that attenuate the internal mode originating from the first hopf bifurcation .",
    "an alternative to our multiple - scale method for deriving slow - time amplitude equations is to apply center - manifold theory with averaging @xcite .",
    "however , the averaging method does not retain the delay in the slow time ; that is , the amplitude equations are ordinary - differential equations , not ddes .",
    "the distinction is not important for their or our investigation because we look for steady - state solutions of the amplitude equations .",
    "however , time - varying amplitudes may require consideration of the slow - time delay .",
    "reddy et al .",
    "@xcite considered delay - coupled stuart - landau ddes similar to the amplitude equations we derive here . however , the complex coefficients they use are appropriate for limit - cycle oscillators and not the lasers that we consider .",
    "they focus their work on the properties of synchronization and amplitude death .    in the next section ,",

    "in addition , for large values of the delay the frequency difference between the external modes becomes very small and many external modes are excited at nearly the same value of the coupling . for these cases",
    "the linear stability theory may be insufficient to identify the mode that is observed in the experiments .",
