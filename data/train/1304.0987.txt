    "the role of the particle valence  defined as the ability to form only a limited number of bonds with neighbouring particles  in controlling the phase behaviour of colloidal systems has been emphasized in numerous recent studies  @xcite .",
    "limited valence has emerged as the key element in the formation of equilibrium colloidal networks , commonly named gels . in this state of matter",
    ", rigidity is enforced by the long - life of the inter - particle bonds , which , at low temperatures @xmath0 , is longer than the experimental observation time  @xcite .",
    "lowering the valence guarantees that these low @xmath0 gel states do not clash with phase separation , which is always present when the thermal energy becomes significantly lower than the characteristic bond strength . in contrast with the out - of - equilibrium colloidal gels formed via spinodal decomposition followed by a kinetic arrest induced by the strong depletion attraction  @xcite , limited valence gels are equilibrium states .",
    "it has indeed been shown that lowering the valence shifts the phase separation boundaries to low densities  @xcite , opening a wide region of particle concentrations where stable gels can form  @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures of limited valence particles enrich considerably more the spectrum of possibilities offered by limited valence .",
    "first , the average valence of the system can take non - integer values , which has been exploited to investigate the approach to the limit of valence two . in this limiting case , phase separation is completely suppressed , since particles aggregate in long chains that interact only through excluded volume interactions .",
    "second , mixtures can be exploited to tune the selectivity of the network to different species , stabilizing mixed or interpenetrating gels  @xcite , the equilibrium equivalent of the recently reported out - of - equilibrium bigels  @xcite .    in limited valence systems ,",
    "gas - liquid phase separation arises from a subtle competition between the number of bonds that can form in the two coexisting phases ( the energy term ) and the entropy .",
    "the latter accounts for the degeneracy of the bonding patterns , which is different in the two phases .",
    "the gas phase is usually formed by diluted clusters , while the liquid phase is characterized by a percolating network of bonds .",
    "this competition is captured by the thermodynamic perturbation theory ( tpt ) developed by wertheim  @xcite to model the behaviour of associating fluids , the atomic and molecular analogues of limited - valence colloids .",
    "wertheim theory is a powerful tool for investigating the phase behaviour of pure fluids as well as of binary mixtures  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies of binary mixtures with different compositions have revealed a subtle interplay between the entropy of bonding and the entropy of mixing , with a marked effect on the phase diagram of the mixture .",
    "interestingly , wertheim theory predicts that for binary mixtures of bi- and three - functional particles , the gas - liquid critical density @xmath1 and the critical temperature @xmath2 decrease as the average valence decreases ( _ i.e. , _ on increasing the fraction of bi - functional particles )  @xcite , in agreement with existing numerical results  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for a binary mixtures of bi- and tetra - functional particles , wertheim theory predicts a qualitative difference in the behaviour of the critical parameters .",
    "indeed , binary mixtures of such species are expected to initially undergo an increase of @xmath1 as the average valence decreases . a further increase in the number of bi - functional particles inverts this trend and @xmath1 decreases and tends to a constant value as the fraction of bi - functional particles approaches one .",
    "finally , mixtures of two and five functional particles are predicted to have critical densities which increase monotonically as the average valence is lowered  @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation of phase coexistence in binary mixtures is not an easy task .",
    "indeed , the presence of a second species adds a new axis to the phase diagram , which is now a three - dimensional volume defined by @xmath0 and the density of the two components ( @xmath3 ) or by other combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the total number density and @xmath8 is the composition of the mixture  @xcite .",
    "the two coexisting phases are characterized by different values of @xmath9 . even focusing on a specific @xmath9 value ( along the so - called dilution line )",
    ", the determination of the phase diagram requires the evaluation of the shadow lines  @xcite . in this manuscript",
    "we introduce a new and powerful computational method to investigate the phase behaviour of mixtures in the whole three - dimensional volume , by extending the successive umbrella sampling method  @xcite , which was shown to be very effective in the evaluation of the phase behaviour of single component systems  @xcite . by applying this new methodology",
    "it is possible to compute the entire density of states for the binary mixture , _",
    "i.e. , _ the information required to estimate phase coexistence at all compositions . as a test case of scientific relevance",
    "we compute the phase diagram of mixtures of bi - functional and three - functional patchy particles in two - dimensions ( @xmath10 ) and of bi - functional and tetra - functional patchy particles in three dimensions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we then compare numerical results with theoretical predictions based on wertheim theory , confirming the predicted growth of the critical density in the @xmath12 mixture as the fraction of bi - functional particles is increased .",
    "the analysis of the calculated phase behaviour shows that the @xmath1 growth on increasing the number of bi - functional particles results from a progressive transformation of the transition from condensation to demixing . at the same time , increasing the number of particles with two patches does reduce the region in density where the instability takes place , confirming the general trend that a reduction of the average valence increases the density region where a stable gel can form .",
    "each particle is modelled as a hard sphere ( in 3d ) or a hard disk ( in 2d ) of diameter @xmath13 , decorated with a fixed number of interacting patches on the surface .",
    "the patch - patch interaction between particles @xmath14 and @xmath15 is described by a kern - frenkel ( kf ) potential , _",
    "i.e. , _ it is a square - well potential of range @xmath16 and depth @xmath17 , modulated by a function @xmath18 which depends solely on the particle orientations @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "all the patches share the same shape , _",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath26 are fixed and do not depend on particle species .",
    "the only difference between particles of different species is in the number of patches patterning their surfaces . in 2d",

    "this technique provides an expression for the order parameter @xmath37 which can be used to fit the probability distribution @xmath38 of non - symmetric fluids to the ising one , in order to estimate the pseudo - critical parameters of the finite system . on top of that , the bw approach provides scaling expressions which can be used to obtain the values of the critical parameters in the thermodynamic limit . with this procedure",

    "as shown in the previous section , the 2d critical line tends asymptotically to @xmath166 and @xmath167 , which makes it possible to find coexisting phases at arbitrarily low densities .",
    "by contrast , the 3d critical line ends at finite densities @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "in addition , in the 2d mixture the theory captures the overall behaviour of the system .",
    "in particular , the decrease of @xmath157 and @xmath156 at criticality , observed in simulations , is well reproduced . in the 3d case ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a qualitative difference between numerical and theoretical results .",
    "as the system is cooled down , there is an increase of the critical @xmath157 and @xmath158 as computed in simulations , while the theory predicts a decrease of the critical @xmath158 .",
    "this difference is associated to a different slope of tie lines , i.e. of the lines connecting the two coexisting phases .",
    "tie lines for the lowest-@xmath0 systems are shown in figure  [ fig : tie_lines_sim ] ( simulations data ) and in figure  [ fig : tie_lines_teo ] ( theoretical results ) .    .",
    "it crosses the coexistence region in two points which are part of the cloud curve ( filled red squares ) .",
    "their coexisting partners are part of the shadow cloud ( open red squares ) . ]",
    "if tie lines have positive slopes , the coexisting points follow the same trend as constant - composition lines which , in this representation , are straight lines with zero intercept .",
    "this means that high - density phases always have a higher density of both species than the coexisting low - density phases . in the systems studied here ,",
    "this is true for the 2d numerical and theoretical results and for the theoretical 3d mixture .",
    "by contrast , the numerical 3d system exhibits tie lines with negative slope : the gas - like phases always have more bi - functional particles than their respective liquid - like phases . in this regard",
    ", the theory fails to capture the demixing nature of the phase separation occurring in the 3d system as observed in simulations . on passing ,",
    "we note that wertheim theory predicts tie lines with negative slopes in mixtures of particles with two and six patches ( now shown ) .",
    "a different representation can be constructed by projecting the three dimensional phase diagram onto the @xmath119 , @xmath9 plane , _",
    "i.e. , _ total density against composition ( molar fraction of bi - functional particles ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig:3d_tot_x_rho ] ( monte carlo simulation ) and in figure  [ fig:3d_tot_x_rho_teo ] ( wertheim s theory ) .",
    "this representation makes it clear that the increase of the critical density in the 3d systems is due to the contribution of the low - density phase , which moves to larger densities and compositions as the temperature is lowered in the vicinity of the critical temperature of the pure four - patches fluid . in the 2d system ,",
    "on the other hand , the density range of the low - density phase does not change strongly with @xmath0 , while the composition increases steadily .",
    "this results in the shift of the critical density to smaller values .",
    "this particular projection of the phase diagram hides some of the differences we previously noted between theory and simulations .",

    "a common bi - dimensional representation of the phase diagram of binary mixtures is done by making a cut at a fixed composition in the three - dimensional @xmath168 phase diagram .",
    "the intersection between the cutting plane and a fixed temperature plane is usually called dilution line  @xcite , because by following it the density of the system can be varied without changing the overall composition . the points at which the dilution line intersect the phase boundary are the so - called cloud points .",
    "each of these points coexists with a infinitesimal amount of the other phase which has , in general , a different composition .",
    "these points are called shadow points .",
    "an exemplification of this procedure is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : tie_lines_sim](a ) . the shadow and cloud curves",
    "are then constructed by plotting the sets of cloud and shadow points on the @xmath0 , @xmath119 plane .",
    "note that this cloud - shadow construction is a projection and therefore , while the cloud points have the same composition , the composition of the shadow points varies , _ i.e. , _ the tie lines are out - of - plane .",

    "each point on the gas branch of the cloud curve ( filled circles ) is in coexistence with the point on the liquid branch of the shadow curve at the same temperature ( filled squares ) , and vice versa ( empty symbols ) .",

    "the orange diamond marks the position of the critical point at @xmath170 , which happens to have the same composition . in line with the results of section  [ subsec :",
    "coexistence ] , the curves resemble the usual bell - shaped gas - liquid coexisting regions observed in pure systems  @xcite .",
    "both cloud and shadow curves have a low - density ( high - density ) phase which is in coexistence with a high - density ( low - density ) phase .",
    "in addition , all the coexisting branches have a monotonic @xmath0-dependence . indeed , both the low - density cloud branch and the high - density shadow branch have nearly @xmath0-independent densities , whereas the densities of the low - density shadow branch and of the high - density cloud branch are monotonically decreasing and increasing , respectively , as in gas - liquid phase transitions of pure , simple fluids .",
    "all the cloud - shadow constructions computed for the 2d mixtures share the same qualitative features with the one shown here , regardless of @xmath9 .",
    "theoretical results , shown in fig .  [ fig:2d_cloud](b ) , are qualitatively in line with simulation data .    .",

    "the @xmath171 mixture , as previously noted , behaves in a different way .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d_cloud ] shows the cloud and shadow curves for a mixture with a fixed composition @xmath172 .",
    "the whole cloud curve has a monotonic @xmath0-dependence and its behaviour is qualitatively similar to the 2d case .",
    "the shadow curve , on the other hand , exhibits several remarkable features .",
    "first of all , the density of the low - density branch is rather high , being half - way between the two branches of the cloud curve and very close to the critical density .",
    "moreover , its temperature dependence is non - monotonic , first decreasing and increasing upon lowering @xmath0 .",
    "the high - density branch seems to be non - monotonic as well and , at a slightly lower temperature than the lowest investigated @xmath0 , a crossing between the cloud and the shadow high - density branches is expected .",
    "we ascribe the lacking of this feature in the theoretical curves , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_cloud](b ) , to the demixing character of the transition .",
    "we have extended the successive umbrella sampling method  @xcite to binary mixtures in oder to simulate the full bulk phase diagram .",
    "the method consists in dividing the simulation cell into a set of overlapping windows of variable size , which is set by the number of particles of each species allowed in a particular window .",
    "each window is then sampled by means of grand canonical monte carlo simulations , counting the number of times that different microstates , characterized by the number of particles of each species , appears in each window .",
    "this gives the probability distribution of microstates , and thus the desired thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "we have tested the validity of the new method by computing the phase behaviour of patchy colloidal mixtures .",
    "we have compared the results with the theoretical predictions of wertheim s first order perturbation theory .",
    "we have analysed two types of colloidal mixtures : bi- and three - functional patchy particles in two dimensions , and bi- and tetra - functional patchy particles in three dimensions . in the first case , bi- and three - functional patchy colloids in 2d ,",
    "simulation and theory are in excellent agreement .",
    "the agreement is quantitative for those variables that do not involve the density , such as the temperature or composition .",
    "the theory underestimates the density ( a well know problem of wertheim s first order perturbation theory ) as it neglects the formation of closed loops . as a consequence",
    "the agreement between the predicted densities and those found in the simulations is only qualitative .",
    "the phase behaviour of these mixtures is similar to that of bi- and three - functional particles in three dimensions  @xcite : the critical density vanishes as the critical temperature approaches zero , suppressing condensation and yielding an increasingly large region of phase space where empty liquids are stable .",
    "thus , dimensionality does not change the topology of the phase diagram of these mixtures .",
    "this was to be expected since the energy and entropy of bonding dominate the behaviour of such mixtures and this is determined by the functionality of the particles , rather than by the spatial dimension .",
    "three dimensional mixtures of bi- and tetra - functional colloids , however , exhibit a different behaviour .",
    "the results of wertheim s theory predict that as the critical temperature decreases the critical density first increases , then decreases and tends asymptotically to a value , which is different from zero .",
    "the simulation confirms the initial increase of the critical density but the non - monotonic behaviour could not be confirmed by simulations as it occurs ( according to the theory ) at very low temperatures , a region not accessible by the current simulation techniques . despite the qualitative description of the mixture s critical behaviour , the theory fails to describe adequately the shadow and cloud curves for these mixture .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy may be related to the formation of closed loops of particles , neglected by the theory , which increase in number as the functionality of the particles increases .    in summary",
    "we have developed and tested a new simulation scheme to investigate the phase diagram of binary mixtures of patchy colloidal particles .",
    "the new method can be applied to a large variety of problems , such as the surface and confinement properties of patchy colloidal mixtures , or the study of the bulk and percolation properties of the recently predicted bicontinuous gels or bigels  @xcite . in mixtures of patchy particles",
    "these bigels may be equilibrium structures , when they occur in the empty liquid regime @xcite or dynamically arrested structures when they occur inside the liquid - vapour or the liquid - liquid binodals , as in ordinary binary mixtures @xcite . a detailed investigation of the connectivity and other physical properties of these structures , in and out of equilibrium ,",
