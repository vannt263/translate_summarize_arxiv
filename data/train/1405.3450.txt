    "the coronal heating problem is a long - standing issue in solar physics .",
    "it aims at explaining the reason why the solar corona has a mean temperature above 1  mk , while the surface of the sun has an effective temperature of 5800  k , and also how this high temperature can be maintained during a solar cycle .",
    "hence the solar coronal heating problem is to understand how the thermal energy is continuously and uniformly transported and distributed over a large volume like the corona .",
    "one of the favorite model is the heating by small bursts of magnetic energy , the so - called nanoflare heating problem as first mentioned by parker ( @xcite ) : this model explains that the coronal plasma can be heated to high temperatures with a high rate of occurrences of uniformly distributed nanoflares explaining the sustainability of the heating .",
    "parker s idea has been developed for coronal loops in active regions in which the main source of magnetic energy is located , and with the wealth of observations in different wavelength ranges , which provide strong observational constraints @xcite . by extension , the nanoflare model refers to the heating of loops by a series of energy releases , and does not refer to any particular mechanisms generating these bursts of energy ( e.g. , magnetic reconnection , wave mode coupling , turbulence ) . even if they account for a small fraction of the total coronal heating budget , the understanding of the heating of coronal loops is crucial for solving the global coronal heating problem : loops are well observed in a wide variety of temperature bands and thus their thermodynamical properties are well constrained .",
    "the state - of - the - art of this field of research has been reviewed in length by @xcite . despite the large number of loop observations , their nature",
    "is still debated : single field line versus multi - stranded flux bundle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , isothermal versus multithermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this study",
    ", we define a loop as a multistranded flux bundle implying a multithermal plasma .",
    "the loop temperature is sustained by a series of small , short releases of energy mimicking the nanoflare model .",
    "downflows have been commonly observed in quiet - sun and active regions since @xcite using _ skylab _ spectroscopic observations .",
    "the authors concluded that , for temperatures between 70000 k and 200000 k , the plasma responsible for the downflows was producing more emission in the uv than the plasma responsible for upflows .",
    "however , these observations did not shed light on the nature of those dopplershifts ( transient or persistent ) .",
    "our work is motivated by recent observations of high blueshift patches in active region outskirts reported by @xcite and @xcite lasting for several hours .",
    "@xcite have simulated the emergence of an active region similar to the one studied by @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the blueshifts appear in the surrounding of the active region during the expansion phase of the emergence process and are also owed to the presence of a coronal hole interacting with the emerging flux .",
    "@xcite showed that the active region exhibits an enhancement of the blueshifts in the fe xii line at 194    prior to the eruption .",
    "hence , the increase in blueshifts has been considered as a precursor of the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) associated with this active region .",
    "the complex topology of the magnetic field is also a crucial ingredient of the scenario developed by @xcite to explain blueshifts observed at the edges of an active region .",
    "the authors have combined euv and radio observations to determine that the blueshifts are occurring at the interface of open and close magnetic field lines , and are sustained by the continuous magnetic reconnection thanks to the growth of the active region .",
    "based on a nanoflare model , our goal is to determine if such a model allows us to show the ubiquitous existence of blueshifts and what are their intrinsic properties at different wavelengths compared to the observations above mentioned .",
    "we also rely on the observations by @xcite showing that , within an active region , the amount of blue- and redshifts is strongly dependent on the peak temperature of the spectral line observed : cooler is the spectral line , redder is the dopplershift distribution , and reciprocally , hotter is the spectral line , bluer is the dopplershift distribution . @xcite",
    "have used the capabilities of _ hinode_/eis to obtain simultaneous rasters in several euv spectral lines covering a wide range of coronal temperatures ( from si vii at 0.63  mk to fe xv at 2.2  mk ) .",
    "the authors found that the si vii observations of an active region are dominated by redshifts while hotter lines are dominated by blueshifts .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that it seems that the fe xii and fe xiii lines correspond to a peak in the distribution of blueshifts , and hence less blueshifts are observed at higher temperatures while blueshifts are still dominating the distribution of dopplershifts in the active region .",
    "similar observations have also been reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "flows in moss have also attracted a lot of interest .",
    "the moss observed in active regions corresponds supposedly to the emission of hot , core coronal loops at the transition region @xcite . in terms of dopplershifts ,",
    "the moss is dominated by redshifts for ions from c iv to fe xiii , that is to say , from the transition region to the corona at 1.78 mk @xcite .    in section  [ sec : model ]",
    ", we describe the nanoflare heating model used to determine the dopplershifts in hot and warm loops .",

    "the corona is a highly conducting medium with a low plasma @xmath0 ( ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure ) .",
    "therefore the plasma dynamics occurs along magnetic field lines , and there is no or limited feedback between the magnetic field and thermodynamic parameters .",
    "these particular physical conditions justify modelling coronal loops with the hydrodynamic equations projected along the loop and , neglecting perpendicular thermal conduction .",
    "even if magnetic field lines have to satisfy the solenoidal condition , we neglect the variation of the loop radius with height which should occur along a coronal loop with a magnetic field decreasing with height . despite the increasing number of observations of coronal loops , there is no evidence that the radius or width of a loop increases with height @xcite .",
    "a coronal loop is defined as a collection of 128 strands .",
    "each individual strand ( @xmath1 ) evolves following the time - dependent one - dimensional ( 1d ) hydrodynamic model satisfying mass , momentum , and energy conservation as well as the perfect gas law :    @xmath2    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6",
    "where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the density , pressure and temperature of the strand @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the plasma flow along the strand , @xmath12 is the curvilinear abscissa along the semi - circular loop ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the number density @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is @xmath17 ( kg m@xmath18 ) .",
    "the numerical code is based on the lagrangian remap method developed by @xcite , and further developed for multi - stranded coronal loops by @xcite .",
    "erg and a uniform heating .",
    "each line segment indicates the duration of the burst , and the color - coding the amount of energy injected . ]",
    "the geometry of the loop is described by a total length of 100 mm , a radius of 2 mm . assuming that the loop is semi - circular , the height of the loop is thus 32 mm . the height of the loop is less than the typical pressure scale - height of a coronal plasma at 1 mk justifying the use of a constant gravity , @xmath19 .",
    "the 100 mm loop is divided into two main areas : a transition region ( width of 5 mm ) in which the temperature is increasing rapidly and the density decreasing rapidly , and a corona . therefore the coronal part of the loop has a length of 90 mm .",
    "in addition , there is a chromospheric part at each footpoint of 5 mm acting as a reservoir of plasma .",
    "we consider a total duration of 4 hours 30 min with outputs extracted every 1 s. the lagrangian remap time - step depends on the location along the loop and on the characteristic time scales of thermal conduction and radiative losses .",
    "the energy equation contains three terms on the right hand side : the thermal conduction with @xmath20 being a function of the temperature following spitzer formula , the radiative cooling term where @xmath21 is a piecewise function ( see figure  [ fig : rad_loss ] ) adapted from @xcite , and the heating source term @xmath22 .",
    "the latter is define as successive heating bursts with an energy of similar order as a nanoflare .",
    "each strand is subject to 64 bursts which are randomly distributed in time , location , duration , and amount of energy injected : in figure  [ fig : burst_prop ] , we plot the distribution of bursts for a choosen strand ( for the sake of clarity ) . in the following ,",
    "we perform two experiments : ( 1 ) with a minimum of energy per bursts of @xmath23 erg for a total energy of 5.13@xmath2410@xmath25 erg , ( 2 ) with a minimum of energy per bursts of @xmath26 erg for a total energy of 5.13@xmath2410@xmath27 erg .",
    "as depicted in figure  [ fig : rad_burst ] , the random distribution of bursts along a strand is localised at the footpoint of the strand ( @xmath28 ) , uniformly distributed along the strand ( @xmath29 ) , or localised at the apex of the strand ( @xmath30 ) .     (",

    "the initial temperature is constant in the corona at 1 mk , and linearly decreasing from the bottom of the corona to the top of the chromosphere ( 10000 k ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dens ] , we plot the density profile along the loop which describe the initial density as an hydrostatic equilibrium ( exponential decay with height with a constant pressure - scale height ) .",
    "the thermodynamic evolution of the loop is defined by the evolution of the density @xmath31 ( sum of strand density @xmath7 ) and the temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the multi - stranded loop is characterised by an emission measure weighted temperature : @xmath33 the two experiments conducted here lead to two different types of loop differentiated by their thermal properties : ( i ) a warm loop with a mean temperature of 1.5 mk and an apex temperature of at most 2.2 mk , ( ii ) a hot loop with a typical temperature around 3  mk for the different heating locations and with an apex temperature of about 4  mk .",
    "it is worthnoting that our definition of warm and hot loops is independent of the definition currently accepted in the observational framework ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath32 for the two loop models and the different heating locations is depicted in figure  [ fig : temp ] along the loop ( solid black curves ) , and at the apex of the loop ( light - gray curves ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the temperature reaches an equilibrium value rapidly after the start of the computation . in the following",
    ", we will consider that the loop has reached an equilibrium for all models one hour after the beginning of the simulation ( solid vertical line in figure  [ fig : temp ] ) .",
    "we also note that the loop is filled by the heated plasma at a different rate for both cases : as expected , it takes a much longer time ( 15@xmath3420 minutes ) for the warm loop to reach reasonable thermodynamic parameters , compared to less than 10 minutes for the hot loop .",
    "there is no significant time delay in achieving an equilibrium between the three different heating locations .",
    "we plot the profiles of density ( figure  [ fig : dt ] top ) and temperature ( figure  [ fig : dt ] bottom ) average over two hours for the two experiments ( hot loop in black , warm loop in gray ) and for the different heating locations ( @xmath28 : solid line , @xmath29 : dotted line , and @xmath30 : dashed line ) .",
    "for the hot loop , the density at the loop top decreases from 3.4@xmath2410@xmath35 kg m@xmath18 for the @xmath28 heating to 3.1@xmath2410@xmath35 kg m@xmath18 for the @xmath30 heating , while the temperature increases from 3.3 mk to 4 mk .",
    "as noted by @xcite in simulating a multi - stranded loop , the @xmath28 heating can mimick a coronal loop with a constant temperature due to the flatness of the temperature profile .",
    "the temperature profiles are similar to those modelled by @xcite in a numerical experiment of flux braiding .",
    "although the change in density and temperature is 10@xmath3620%  between the different heating locations , the observation of coronal loops does not permit a clear identification of the heating source ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also important to notice the difference in temperature at the apex of the loop depending on the location of the heating deposition : the apex temperature of the hot loop is 3.3 mk for the @xmath28 heating and 4 mk for the @xmath30 heating .",
    "this difference results from the small temperature gradients at the apex compared to the coronal footpoints near the transition to chromospheric temperatures , and also from the bidirectional flows generated by the energy deposition which over - heats the loop top .    :",

    "in order to compare the behavior of the simulated dopplershifts and the observed ones , we select ten spectral lines with a peak emission temperature @xmath37 between 250000 k and 5.6 mk ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) such as :    * the spectral lines appear in @xcite ; * the spectral lines are also in the list of _",

    "the temperature range is the same as for the radiative loss function ( see figure  [ fig : rad_loss ] ) ]    ) . ]      in order to compute the doppler velocity for a given spectral line , we need to proceed in two steps .",
    "the first step is to compute the velocity for a given transition with a contribution @xmath38 using the following equation : @xmath39 the @xmath38 contributions are depicted in figure  [ fig : contrib ] for the ten spectral lines used in this paper .",
    "the second step is to define the geometry of the loop and in particular the observer point - of - view in order to project the velocity and to obtain the red ( downflows ) and blue ( upflows ) dopplershifts .",
    "there is not a significant difference between the three different heating locations in terms of the analysis of dopplershifts , thus we are just showing the results for the @xmath28 heating as it is the most favorable location for heating the corona : we reckon that the complexity of the magnetic field which can lead to continuous nanoflare occurrence is most likely to be located near the chromosphere @xcite making magnetic reconnection and wave mode coupling two mechanisms highly efficient in this region .",
    "the apex and uniform heating locations lead to similar conclusions .     for the hot loop .",

    "the dopplershift distribution depends on the time the raster has started . for instance , while the cool lines exhibit only redshifts for the first raster ( figure  [ fig : raster_fp_hot_step ] left ) , the second raster ( figure  [ fig : raster_fp_hot_step ] right ) evidence blueshifts in the mg v and si vii lines.the distributions are smooth due to the interpolation between consecutive exposure times .",
    "qualitatively , the rasters indicate the same behavior as the modelled loop : redshift dominated for cool lines below fe xii and fe xv for the warm and hot loop respectively , and blueshift dominated above fe xii and fe xv for the warm and hot loop respectively . the strong blue and redshifts",
    "are located at the footpoints of the loop owe to a combined effect of high density and integration along the line - of - sight .",
    "there is no symmetry between the two footpoints of the loop because of the randomness of the nanoflare heating deposition .",
    "@xcite reported _",
    "hinode_/eis observations of two different active regions with a broad temperature coverage from si vii to fe xv ( nine different lines ) .",
    "both observations show evidence of temperature dependence of the downflow and upflow regions : downflows ( redshifts ) are dominating cool lines such as the si vii , while upflows ( blueshifts ) dominate the hot lines ( from fe xi to fe xv ) .",
    "their first observation ( see figure  3 of @xcite @xcite ) shows a clear sudden increase of the blueshift in the fe xi line , while their second observation ( see figure  4 of @xcite @xcite ) shows an increase in the fe x line .",
    "according to the above results for the multistranded model ( see figures  [ fig : raster_fp_hot_step ] and  [ fig : raster_fp_warm_step ] ) , we can complement @xcite article by concluding that the active region loops are warm loops with a characteristic temperature at the apex of about 2 mk , and that the overall temperature of the first active region is larger than the temperature of the second active region .",
    "2 hours , ( _ right _ ) raster with a 3  step and of duration about 30 minutes . ]     for the hot loop . ]",
    "we now compare the typical _",
    "raster with a 3  step with two other possible observations : ( i ) the instantaneous observation with an exposure time of 50 s , ( ii ) the dense raster without the stepping of 3  ( consecutive 50 s exposures ) .",
    "the latter raster takes about 2 hours to be completed .",
    "the corresponding rasters are depicted in figure  [ fig : raster_fp_warm ] for the warm loop and in figure  [ fig : raster_fp_hot ] for the hot loop .",
    "all three types of observations are reproducing the main features of the dopplershifts : ( i ) cool spectral lines dominated by redshifts and hot spectral lines by blueshifts , ( ii ) the blueshifts in hot lines are located at the footpoints , ( iii ) the warm and hot loops have a blueshift distribution dependent on their characteristic temperature .",
    "however , the dopplershift distribution for the instantaneous observation ( left ) is smooth owe to the continuity of the different physical quantity at a given time , the distribution of 3step raster is also smooth due to the interpolation , while the distribution of the 1  continuous raster is patchy due to the different times of observations and the bursty nature of the heating mechanism ( and the possible occurrence of shocks ) .",
    "thus , only a series of instantaneous observations or the dense raster with sufficient time and spatial resolutions evidence the nature of the heating mechanism along the loop .",
    "recently , @xcite have observed the increase in the upflow velocity in an active region prior to a cme .",
    "the authors have interpreted this increase in the fe xii line as a precursor of the eruption .",
    "they claim that the increase is due to the continuous expansion / emergence of the active region leading to the interaction between the expanding magnetic field and the nearby coronal hole magnetic field .",
    "these interpretation has been confirmed by simulated flux emergence from the bottom of the convection zone to the corona , and by making close comparison between the model and the observations @xcite . based on our nanoflare model of hot and warm loops having the same geometrical properties",
    ", we are able to give an other possible interpretation to the increase of upflows in a single wavelength range . in figure  [ fig : binc ] , we plot the dopplershift distributions for a hot loop ( solid line ) and a warm loop ( dashed line ) in the fe xii line , and for the @xmath28 heating .",
    "the increase of the upflow velocity can be explained by a cooling of the loop keeping the loop length constant : the decrease of the amount of energy injected in the warm loop model being 10 times less than the energy input for the hot loop model .",
    "our study also shows that the tomographic or multithermal observations of a loop is required to better understand the thermodynamical properties of the observed loop , and also to analysis its time evolution .",
    "furthermore , @xcite supported the conclusions of @xcite by studying the relationship between persistent blueshifts in active regions , metric radio noise storms and the magnetic topology of the coronal magnetic field .",
    "they conclude that the continuous growth of the active region is sustaining a steady reconnection rate across separatrix surfaces .",
    "the magnetic reconnection occurs between open field lines in the outskirts of the active region and closed loops in the core .",
    "as their conclusions are also based on very few spectroscopic observations to derive the dopplershift distribution ( mostly in a fe xii line ) , the viable mechanism that the authors described can certainly applied to some field lines but surely not to all closed field lines .",
    "the multistranded model suggests that the existence and evolution of blueshifts for closed loops is controlled by the amount of energy input : the fan field lines which are blueshifted in the fe xii lines are warm loops , while the core field lines which are still redshifted in the fe xii are hot loops .",
    "the latter is confirmed by the x - rays observations ( see figure  3 in @xcite @xcite ) .        in terms of modelling ,",
    "@xcite have modelled the possible interchange - reconnection model which can explain the increase of blueshifts in coronal loops . based on a 1d hydrostatic model ,",
    "the authors justify the interchange - reconnection by the increase of blueshift velocities with the increase of the ionisation of iron lines with typical blueshift velocities of 10 km@xmath40s@xmath41  for fe x and fe xii , 20 km@xmath40s@xmath41  for fe xiv , and 40 - 50 km@xmath40s@xmath41  for fe xvi .",
    "these characteristic velocities are similar to the one obtained for the warm loop modelled with the multi - stranded model of a single close loop with footpoint heating ( see figure  [ fig : warm_vel ] ) .    by modelling a warm and hot loop",
    ", we thus showed that there are alternative mechanisms to the observed increased in blueshifts in the fe xii line .",
    "however , the estimated dopplershifts from our model do not reproduce the large doppershift velocity reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to issue a warning in the physical interpretation of dopplershifts using a single spectral line ; several spectral lines covering a broad range of temperature are required to understand the physics happening within coronal loops .          using the capabilities of _ hinode_/eis combined with magnetic field extrapolations ,",
    "@xcite have shown that mass flows can be observed in large - scale loops connecting two distant active regions : one footpoint being blueshifted , the other one being redshifted . from the simulated _",
    "hinode_/eis rasters , we deduced that loops with a blue and a redshifted footpoint can be observed . in figure",
    "[ fig : same_dopp ] , we plot the percentage of loops with an opposite sign of dopplershift at footpoints for the warm ( gray ) and hot ( dark ) loop models and also for the three different locations of heating ( @xmath28 : solid line , @xmath29 : dotted line , @xmath30 : dash line ) . as for the statistical study of dopplershifts in section  [ sec : doppler ] ,",
    "the percentage of loops with footpoints of opposite dopplershifts depends on the spectral line and on the mean temperature of the loop : about 50% of loops have opposite dopplershifts in the fe x line for the warm loop and in the fe xv line for the hot loop .",
    "the peak in percentage appears for the same spectral line for each source of heating . none or only a small amount of loops",
    "( @xmath49 5% ) has opposite dopplershifts for spectral lines cooler than the mean temperature of the loop , whilst the percentage stays above 10% for spectral lines",
    "hotter than the mean temperature ( fe xii for the warm loop and ca xv for the hot loop ) .",
    "the change in percentage between a uniformly and footpoint heated loop is small which makes both heating locations difficult to distinguish , whilst , for appropriate spectral lines , the percentage for the apex heated loop is significant ( more than a factor of two less ) .",
    "we have complemented the work of @xcite regarding the thermodynamic properties of coronal loops defined a collection of strands .",
    "we have computed the physical properties of a 100 mm loop with two different energy inputs with a particular focus on the dopplershifts distribution for different spectral lines .",
    "the recent _",
    "hinode_/eis observations have put forward the existence of both blueshift and redshift velocities in active region loops @xcite , the amount of dopplershifts depending on the peak temperature of the observed spectral line .",
    "the multistranded coronal loop model has reproduce the main observed features : ( 1 ) red and blueshifts exist in active region loops of realistic length ( 100 mm ) ; ( 2 ) the amount of red and blueshifts depends on the peak temperature of the observed spectral line : cooler lines being redder , hotter lines being bluer ; ( 3 ) the amount of red and blueshifts depends on the mean / average temperature of the loop ( as an amalgamation of strands ) .",
    "these properties are now well - known for coronal loops and have been reproduced with other numerical experiments ( see , for instance , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the 1d multistranded hydrodynamic model offers more information on the spatial and temporal evolution of heated coronal loops , and thus on the physical processes at play .",
    "the comparison between the multistranded model and modelled observations leads to the following physical interpretations :    * redshifts in the cooler spectral lines evidence the condensation of the plasma mostly located near the footpoints of the loop : dense plasma cooling ; * blueshifts in the hotter spectral lines is a signature of the evaporation of the plasma : hot plasma evacuate towards less dense regions ; * the coexistence of condensation and evaporation for the entire coronal loop is owed to the multistrandedness nature of the loop .",
    "more importantly for future analysis of multi - spectral observations , this study suggests that it is possible to estimate the mean / average temperature of a coronal loop : the transition from redshift - dominated loop to blueshift - dominated loop gives an estimate of the mean temperature of the coronal loop . as an example",
    ", we refer to the study by @xcite of two flare loops observed by _",
    "sdo_/aia and _ hinode_/eis .",
    "the authors measured the dopplershifts at both footpoints of two coronal loops related to the flaring process .",
    "hinode_/eis lines used in their study are fe x at 184.54(log(@xmath50)=6.0 ) , fe xii at 192.39  ( log(@xmath50)=6.09 ) , fe xiii at 202.04  ( log(@xmath50)=6.17 ) , and fe xv at 284.16  ( log(@xmath50)=6.3 ) . from their figure 2 showing the average dopplershifts for the spectral lines mentioned above , we can derive from the temperature diagnostic that ( assuming a view from the top of the loop ) :    * the first set of loops has a temperature close to 1 mk for the first half an hour ofthe observation as the average dopplershift in all spectral lines is negative ; * the first set of loops is then heated to a temperature above 2 mk for about 1h45min for the northern footpoints and for about 15min for the southern footpoints ; * the second set of loops shows a very different behaviour : the heating of the loop is seen as less and less blueshift dominated curve for the northern footpoints ; whilst the southern footpoints exhibit two consecutive heating events . *",
    "the ordering of the spectral lines is consistent with a top view of the loops for the northern footpoints of both sets of loops ; whilst the ordering for the southern footpoints is characteristic of an highly inclined field ( see appendix  [ sec : appa ] ) .",
    "our temperature diagnostic allows us to deduce the same properties of the loop plasma than @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature diagnostic from average dopplershift measured along the loop or at the footpoints is thus a robust diagnostic of the temperature of the loop . as a study case , the active region moss",
    "is observed to be dominated by redshift velocities for spectral lines of peak temperature less than 1.78 mk ( fe xiii ) according the @xcite and @xcite . from the temperature diagnostic",
    "detailed above , we then conclude that the temperature of the coronal loop associated with moss is above 1.78 mk , which is consistent with the moss being the transition counter of hot core active region loops @xcite .    by studying the dopplershift velocities ,",
    "we have also shown that the cooling of a coronal loops can explain the increase of blueshifts observed in active regions .",
    "even if this is an unlikely mechanism , this rises the difficulty of making definitive conclusion from single spectral line observation .",
    "and thus we claim that multi - spectral analysis should become the norm for spectroscopic studies .",
    "it is anticipated that the temperature diagnostic can be applied to _ iris _ and _ solar orbiter_/spice observations .",
    "as notice in appendix  [ sec : appb ] , the temperature diagnostic will be useful for coronal loops having a temperature less than 2 mk due to the limitation in the spectral lines selected .",
    "knowing that the coronal loop temperature can be derived using multi - spectral observations in the frame of this multi - stranded model , the future work will be to produce temperature maps within active regions as well as further estimate of the energy release .",
    "the temperature diagnostic will fail at locations where the heating mechanism is different than the impulsive release of energy considered in this paper .",
    "therefore , the multi - standed hydrodynamic model can give us more information on the plausible heating mechanisms at play in active regions .",
