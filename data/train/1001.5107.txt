    "molecular outflows are common features accompanied with young stellar objects ( ysos ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outflows have large impacts on the surrounding molecular cloud both in the chemical and physical aspect .",
    "shocks excited by the propagation of the outflow raise the temperature of surrounding material and liberate various molecules such as nh@xmath1 , ch@xmath1oh and sio from dust grains @xcite . as a result",
    ", the relative abundance of these molecules against h@xmath8 reaches several orders of magnitude larger than that in quiescent molecular clouds .",
    "the supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds is ubiquitous but should quickly dissipate through shocks , thus some driving sources are needed @xcite .",
    "protostellar outflows are considered to be possible sources to maintain the supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds @xcite and regulate the star formation , since the turbulence serves as a counterwork against the gravitational collapse in molecular clouds .",
    "the observational studies of herbig - haro ( hh ) objects @xcite and co outflows @xcite compared the energy input by the outflows and turbulence energy decay , and found that the outflows have enough energy to retain the turbulence in the molecular clouds in at least local scale ( @xmath9 pc ) , such as ngc 1333 or l1641-n , but not whole perseus or orion giant molecular cloud scale ( @xmath10 pc ) .",
    "the theoretical simulation also pointed out that the protostellar outflows play an important role to retain the turbulence and regulate the star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "barnard 1 ( b1 ) is one of the star - forming regions located in the perseus molecular cloud complex .",
    "the distance to b1 is estimated to be 230 pc by @xcite on the basis of the extinction study .",
    "this value is consistent with the distance of 235 @xmath11 15 pc to the ngc 1333 molecular cloud , which is located at @xmath12 west of b1 , derived from the parallax measurements of the h@xmath8o masers associated with the yso svs 13 @xcite .",
    "note that this distance is different from the previously adopted values of 350 pc and 318 pc , which are the distances to the perseus ob2 association @xcite .",
    "b1 was observed in several molecular lines by @xcite .",
    "they revealed that the dense part of the cloud traced by the c@xmath13o ( @xmath14 ) line has a size of @xmath15 pc and a mass of 518 @xmath16 . inside this region , a denser portion called `` main core '' with a diameter of 0.5 pc and a mass of 65 @xmath16 was found in the nh@xmath1 emission .",
    "a submillimeter continuum survey @xcite identified 12 submillimeter clumps in b1 and six of them are located in the main core region .",
    "two of the submillimeter clumps ( smm 1 and smm 2 ) harbor class 0 ysos and one ( smm 6 ) harbors a class i yso .",
    "inside smm 1 , there are two extremely young sources , b1-bn and b1-bs @xcite .",
    "a class i source in smm 6 was detected by _ iras _ and is referred as iras 03301 + 3057 or b1 irs , and accompanied by an outflow @xcite .",
    "the yso in smm 2 ( also referred as b1-c ) located at @xmath17 north of iras 03301 + 3057 is also a driving source of the outflow that is extending along the east - west direction .",
    "in addition to those four ysos ( b1 irs , b1-bn , b1-bs , and b1-c ) , one class 0 yso was identified in smm 3 , and one class i source in smm 11 @xcite .",
    "there is another class i source , lkh@xmath18 327 , without any submillimeter counterpart . in total , four class 0 and three class i sources are identified in b1 main core .",
    "the properties of the ysos in b1 main core are summarized in table [ sourceparam ] . near infrared observations in h@xmath18 and h@xmath8 rovibrational lines found a number of shocks produced by protostellar outflows in the b1 main core region @xcite .",
    "the most prominent shocks are associated with the outflow from smm 2 .",
    "mid - infrared observations with _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ have clearly revealed the s - shaped features of the knotty chains of the shocks centered at smm 2 , as well as several shocked regions around smm 1 , smm 6 , and smm 11 @xcite .",
    "this paper presents multi - molecular line observations of b1 main core to investigate the effects of protostellar outflows on the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding core .",
    "the details of our observations are described in section 2 .",
    "the results of the observations in co , ch@xmath1oh , and sio lines are described in section 3 , followed by the discussion on the chemical abundance of the molecules and turbulence energy budget in section 4 and a summary in section 5 .",
    "co ( @xmath0 ) , ch@xmath1oh ( @xmath2 ) , and sio ( @xmath0 ) line observations were performed in 2006 april with the 45 m telescope at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) .",
    "the frequencies of the observed lines are summarized in table [ lineparam ] . the 25-beam array receiver system ( bears ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) operated in the double sideband ( dsb ) mode was used for the co and ch@xmath1oh observations .",
    "the system noise temperature of bears during the observations was in the range of @xmath19 ( dsb ) = 200  500 k. the main beam efficiency was @xmath20 0.45 at 115 ghz .",
    "the half power beamwidth ( hpbw ) was 18at 97 ghz ( ch@xmath1oh ) and 15at 115 ghz ( co ) , and the separation between each beam was 411 .",
    "twelve pointings of bears were adopted to map the @xmath21 region , which covers the entire region of b1 main core , with a grid spacing of 291 .",
    "the intensity scales of the 25 receiver beams of bears at 97 ghz were calibrated by comparing the intensity of ngc 2264 observed by each beam of bears with that measured by the single - beam receiver s100 .",
    "the intensity scales of the 25 beams at 115 ghz were calibrated using the scaling factor table provided by the observatory .",
    "the back end was an autocorrelator with a bandwidth of 32 mhz and a frequency resolution of 37.8 khz , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 0.098 km s@xmath5 and 0.12 km s@xmath5 at 115 ghz ( co ) and 97 ghz ( ch@xmath1oh ) , respectively .",
    "the sio ( @xmath0 ) line was observed along the jets from smm 2 and smm 6 with a single - beam sis receiver s40 operated in the single - sideband ( ssb ) mode .",
    "the position angles of the strip scans are 77@xmath22 and 133@xmath22 for smm 2 and smm 6 , respectively .",
    "the observational grid spacing was 384 , which was the same as the hpbw at 43 ghz .",
    "the system noise temperature @xmath19 ( ssb ) during the observations was @xmath23 k. the main beam efficiency was @xmath24 at 43 ghz .",
    "the bandwidth of the autocorrelator was set to 32 mhz .",
    "the spectral resolution was 37.8 khz which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 0.26 km s@xmath5 at 43 ghz .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked by observing the sio maser emission from nml tau every 60 - 90 minutes and the error was estimated to be less than @xmath25 in 100 ghz and 10@xmath26 in 43 ghz observations .",
    "the standard chopper - wheel method @xcite was adopted to convert the received signal into the antenna temperature .",
    "the data were reduced using newstar , a data reduction software developed by nro .",
    "linear baselines were subtracted in most cases .",
    "figure [ colines ] displays the co ( @xmath14 ) line profiles observed at four representative positions in b1 main core , i.e. ( a ) @xmath27 west of smm 2 , ( b ) smm 6 , ( c ) smm 1 , and ( d ) 55 southwest of smm 6 . in this paper , these four positions are referred to as positions `` a '' , `` b '' , `` c '' , and `` d '' , respectively . since there is no jet - like component around this position in the infrared image @xcite ,",
    "it is likely that the spectrum observed at the position d is not affected by outflows .",
    "therefore , the velocity range of the ambient cloud component , `` line core '' , was determined to be from @xmath28 = 2.1 km s@xmath5 to @xmath28 = 9.6 km s@xmath5 , using the co spectrum at the position `` d '' .",
    "the co emission outside of this velocity range is regarded as the outflow component .",
    "the co spectra obtained at the positions `` a '' and `` b '' exhibit line wings in the redshifted side and blueshifted side , respectively .",
    "the most prominent co redshifted wing was observed at the position `` a '' . at the position `` c ''",
    ", wing - like blueshifted emission is detected in the velocity range of 1 km s@xmath5 @xmath29 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this component might be originated from an outflow associated with smm 1 , however , because of its low velocity , it is unclear whether this component arises from the outflow or not .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of the blueshifted co wing ( see below ) is not localized on smm 1 .",
    "therefore , in this paper we do not include this component as an outflow candidate .",
    "the spatial distributions of the blue- and redshifted outflow components are shown in fig.[cooutflow ] .",
    "although the spatial distributions of the high velocity components are complex , two bipolar outflows centered at smm 2 and smm 6 , and the extended blueshifted emission at the southeast corner are recognized .",
    "the outflow centered at smm 2 extends along the east@xmath30west direction .",
    "the extent of the westward redshifted component is 120(0.13 pc ) and reaches the position of a shocked region mh 2 @xcite .",
    "the redshifted emission peaks at the head of the lobe ( position `` a '' ) and the velocity is also the largest at this position . on the other hand , the eastern blueshifted component peaks at 150(0.17 pc ) southeast of smm 2 .",
    "neither the redshifted peak in the west nor the blueshifted peak in the east was covered by the previous co ( @xmath31 ) map @xcite and the interferometric co ( @xmath14 ) map @xcite .",
    "hence the entire picture of this outflow has been revealed by our observations for the first time .",
    "there is a compact blueshifted component in the western lobe and an extended redshifted component in the eastern lobe .",
    "this suggests that the outflow axis is close to the plane of the sky , and the overlapping blueshifted and redshifted components are due to the projection of the front and back sides of the lobes .",
    "the outflow traced by the co line is well aligned with the s - shaped knots seen in the _ spitzer _ irac band 2 image @xcite .",
    "this irac band contains several h@xmath8 pure - rotational lines that are considered to arise from shocked regions .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the s - shaped feature traces the shocks in the outflow driven by smm 2 .",
    "the outflow from smm 6 is more compact than that from smm 2 .",
    "the blueshifted emission is detected toward the position of smm 6 and slightly extended ( @xmath32 , 0.04 pc ) to the northeast .",
    "there is a redshifted component which peaks at @xmath33 ( 0.07 pc ) southwest of smm 6 .",
    "it is uncertain whether this redshifted component is originated from the smm 6 outflow or not , because there is another yso candidate sstc2d j033314.4 + 310711 at @xmath34 ( 0.02 pc ) east of the redshifted peak .",
    "this source is classified as a `` ysoc_red '' ( yso candidate and red ) in the _ spitzer _ c2d catalog , and might be the driving source of the redshifted outflow .",
    "however , the grid spacing of the current observations is not fine enough to pinpoint the position of the driving source unambiguously .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion , the redshifted component at @xmath33 southwest of smm 6 is treated as a redshifted lobe of the smm 6 outflow .",
    "a series of shocked knots mh 4 was found at @xmath35 west of smm 6 and thought to be emanated from smm 6 @xcite .",
    "these knots align east ",
    "west direction and are not parallel to the smm 6 co outflow . since the length of the knots is @xmath34 , smaller than our mapping grid spacing , the relation between the knots and the smm 6 outflow is not clear in the present observations .",
    "an elongated reflection nebula was identified in the @xmath36-band image around smm 6 @xcite and the orientation is consistent with that of the smm 6 outflow .",
    "this consistency would support the idea that smm 6 is the driving source of the redshifted component southwest of smm 6 .",
    "the extended blueshifted co emission is found around the shocked knots mh 8 and hh 790 . in the co image",
    ", this blueshifted component is continuously connected to the blueshifted lobe of the smm 2 outflow . if this blueshifted component in the southeast area is a part of the smm 2 outflow , however , the outflow is highly asymmetric with a blueshifted lobe more than twice as longer as the redshifted lobe .",
    "in addition , the blueshifted lobe bends sharply to the south at the position around the mh 1 knot . in contrast , the shocked components seen in the _ spitzer _ image suggest that the eastern lobe and the western lobe of the smm 2 outflow are similar in length . therefore , it is possible that the blueshifted emission in the southeastern area originates from the other outflow .",
    "one possible candidate is the giant east  west outflow from smm 11 , which was identified in the deep h@xmath8 image obtained by @xcite .",
    "this outflow is parallel to the smm 2 outflow , and contains mh 8 and hh 790 in the eastern lobe .",
    "if mh 8 and hh 790 are related to the outflow from smm 11 , it is natural to consider that the blueshifted co component around mh 8 and hh 790 is also a part of the smm 11 outflow . in the h@xmath8 image ,",
    "the western lobe of the smm 11 outflow extends to mh 10 and mh 3 .",
    "the redshifted co emission was detected around mh 10 and would be the part of the smm 11 outflow .",
    "however , the giant outflow extending further west was not clearly detected in our co observations .",
    "the outflows from smm 1 , smm 3 , and lkh@xmath18 327 are not clearly seen in our co ( @xmath14 ) map , although they were reported by @xcite on the basis of the co ( @xmath31 ) observations , except for that from lkh@xmath18 327 .",
    "our co ( @xmath14 ) maps show the redshifted emission to the northeast of smm 1 .",
    "this component is also seen in the co ( @xmath31 ) map of @xcite , and identified as the redshifted lobe of the smm 1 outflow .",
    "it is possible that this redshifted emission is related to the outflow from smm 1 as argued by @xcite .",
    "however , we regard this emission as a part of the outflow from smm 11 because there is no clear blueshifted component and bipolarity around smm 1 . the mid- and near infrared images show a chain of shocked knots that extends from smm 1 to smm 3 .",
    "the axis of this knot complex is parallel to that of the smm 6 outflow .",
    "although smm 1 is designated to be a driving source of these shocked features @xcite , no corresponding co high - velocity component was detected in the present observations .",
    "lkh@xmath18 327 was classified as class i based on the spectral energy distribution slope in the _ iras _",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38 data @xcite . on the other hand , this source was classified as class ii based on the two micron all sky survey _ k_-band , _ spitzer _ irac , and mips data .",
    "the facts that lkh@xmath18 327 is located at the periphery of b1 main core and not associated with any 850@xmath38 emission indicate that the source is in the rather evolved stage .",
    "the mass , momentum , kinetic energy , and the momentum flux of the identified co outflows are calculated with the method described by @xcite . in this procedure",
    ", we divided the high - velocity co emissions originated from the outflows into the 0.4 km s@xmath5 velocity bins , and calculated the quantities on an assumption of the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) condition .",
    "first , the column density of the molecule in the velocity range of @xmath39 to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , is given as @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 is the planck constant , @xmath45 is the partition function , @xmath46 is the dipole moment of the molecule , @xmath47 is the rotation constant of the molecule , @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath49 is the frequency of the line , @xmath50 is the optical depth , @xmath51 is the excitation temperature , and @xmath52 is the background temperature . for linear molecules such as co , the partition function is approximated to be @xmath53 if @xmath54 . in the case of the co ( @xmath14 ) line under the optically thin assumption ,",
    "the above equations become the following as given by @xcite : @xmath55 the mass at each observed position ( @xmath56 ) and velocity @xmath39 , @xmath57 is given as @xmath58 \\mu_{\\rm m}m_{\\rm h}a(\\alpha , \\delta)n(v),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where [ h@xmath8/co ] is the reciprocal of the co abundance and adopted to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the mean molecular mass per h@xmath8 , @xmath61 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath62 is the area of the co emission at a given observed position . since the observing grid spacing ( @xmath63 ) is larger than the telescope beam ( 15@xmath26 ) , we adopted the squared value of the observing grid spacing as @xmath62 under the assumption of the uniform emission distribution in the @xmath64 region .",
    "the mass at each velocity bin @xmath65 is estimated by integrating @xmath57 over the outflow spatial extension , and then the total mass is derived by integrating @xmath65 over the outflow velocity range .",
    "since the optical depth of the co line is not obtained in our observations , the assumption of the optically thin co ( @xmath14 ) line is adopted , hence the estimation should be a lower limit .",
    "the excitation temperature @xmath51 is estimated by comparing the co ( @xmath14 ) spectra and ( @xmath31 ) spectra @xcite as follows . under the lte condition , the total column density @xmath66 and the column density at a given rotational energy level @xmath67 , @xmath68 ,",
    "is given as @xmath69 @xmath68 is also expressed as @xmath70 in the optically thin condition , where @xmath71 is the einstein @xmath72 coefficient for the transition from the level @xmath73 to @xmath67 .",
    "the relation between the excitation temperature @xmath51 and the line intensity ratio of the co ( @xmath31 ) and ( @xmath14 ) transition is derived from equations ( [ ntotlte ] ) and ( [ njtmb ] ) : @xmath74 the integrated intensities of the high - velocity co ( @xmath31 ) line toward the smm 2 westward redshifted component and smm 6 were calculated from the spectra shown by @xcite .",
    "the integrated intensities , line ratios and the derived excitation temperatures are summarized in table [ colineratio ] .",
    "although the observed positions in the two transitions are slightly different , the offset ( @xmath75 ) is smaller than 1/3 of the beam size and we ignore the positional difference . the derived excitation temperatures toward the two positions , 46 k and 42 k , are close to each other .",
    "we note that the derivation of the excitation temperature is sensitive to the accuracy of the relative calibration between the two independent observations with the different instruments .",
    "for example , a 20% uncertainty of the ratio yields @xmath11 20 k uncertainty of the excitation temperature . here",
    "we adopt 50 k as a value of the excitation temperature for the calculations of the outflow parameters .",
    "this value is the same as that used by @xcite to calculate the outflow properties in the perseus molecular cloud .    the momentum @xmath76 , kinetic energy @xmath77 , dynamical timescale @xmath78 , and the outflow momentum flux @xmath79 are described as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the systemic velocity of 6.7 , 6.5 , and 6.8 km s@xmath5 for the smm 2 , smm 6 , and smm 11 outflows , respectively , measured by fitting a gaussian function to the ch@xmath1oh spectra toward the sources ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "@xmath82 is the length of the outflow and @xmath83 is the characteristic velocity .",
    "the mass - loss rate is estimated as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the velocity of the primary wind ejected from the close vicinity of the protostar . since we do not have any information on the wind velocity from our observations , we assume @xmath86 km s@xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the inclination angle of the outflow axis is also unclear , therefore we employed @xmath87 from the line of sight , which is the mean inclination angle on the assumption of the random outflow orientation .",
    "this assumption should be reasonable for the smm 2 outflow because the interferometric observations revealed that the opening angle of the outflow cavity in the 20scale is @xmath88 and the red and blueshifted lobes are not overlapped at the position of the driving source @xcite , which indicates that the outflow axis inclines at the larger angle than the opening angle .",
    "this interpretation does not conflict with the fact that the blue- and redshifted components are overlapped in the larger scale as shown in fig.[cooutflow ] , because these overlapped blue- and redshifted components are interpreted as the cavity wall . for the smm 6 outflow",
    ", @xcite suggested that the configuration of the smm 6 outflow is in a pole - on geometry , while @xcite suggested that the outflow from smm 6 is inclined toward southwest .",
    "since it is difficult to estimate the inclination angle from our coarse grid observations and there is no consensus on the inclination angle of the smm 6 outflow , it is reasonable to adopt the mean inclination angle .",
    "since there is no previous study about the inclination angle for the smm 11 outflow , we also adopt the mean inclination angle of @xmath87 .",
    "the blueshifted lobes of the outflows from smm 2 and smm 11 are not clearly separated in our observations .",
    "therefore , we assumed that the transverse extent of the smm 2 outflow lobe is symmetric with respect to the shocked knots , and regarded the blueshifted component at decl .",
    "@xmath89 as the smm 2 outflow and that at decl .",
    "@xmath90 as the smm 11 outflow",
    ". the redshifted lobe of the smm 11 outflow is also confused with the eastern redshifted component of the smm 2 outflow .",
    "we assumed that the northeastern half of the redshifted component at the east of smm2 belongs to the smm 2 outflow , because this part is overlapped with the blueshifted lobe of the smm 2 outflow .",
    "the southwestern half of this redshifted component is regarded as the redshifted lobe of the smm 11 outflow .",
    "the outflow parameters derived on the above assumptions are summarized in table [ outflowparam ] .    the mass , momentum , and kinetic energy of the smm 2 outflow are almost comparable to those of the smm 11 outflow and a factor of 510 larger than those of the smm 6 outflow .",
    "the properties of outflows from class 0 and class i sources were compiled by @xcite , and it was found that the outflow momentum flux is 1 order of magnitude larger for class 0 sources . the mean momentum flux is @xmath91 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 and @xmath92 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 for class 0 and class i sources , respectively @xcite .",
    "considering that they adopted an opacity correction of a factor of 3.5 , the momentum fluxes of the outflows emanated from smm 2 and smm 6 are in reasonable agreement with the mean values for class 0 and i sources , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the outflow from smm 11 has approximately 1 order of magnitude larger momentum flux compared to the mean value of the outflows from the class i sources , probably because the spatial extent of this outflow is large .",
    "the momentum fluxes for the outflows were estimated by @xcite based on their co ( @xmath31 ) observations .",
    "converting the assumed distance to b1 from 320 pc to 230 pc , the momentum fluxes are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 for the smm 2 , smm 6 , and smm 11 outflow , respectively .",
    "the momentum flux they derived for all the outflows is smaller than our result , and the difference reaches a factor of 70 for the smm 2 outflow .",
    "there are several reasons for these discrepancies .",
    "first , they did not take the correction of the inclination @xmath96 into account , and this correction makes the momentum flux larger by a factor of @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "our assumption of the inclination of @xmath87 yields the factor of 2.9 .",
    "second , we regard both the westward and eastward redshifted components as the outflow from smm 2 , however , @xcite assigned the eastward redshifted component to the smm 1 ( b1-bs ) outflow .",
    "this different identification causes another factor of 2 discrepancy in the estimation of the outflow momentum flux . finally , the mapped region by @xcite does not cover the entire extent of the outflow from smm 2 . in general ,",
    "the outflow momentum flux is a robust parameter against incomplete mappings .",
    "if a considerable fraction of the total momentum is carried by components outside the mapping area , however , incomplete mapping observations might result in underestimation of the momentum flux .",
    "in fact , the prominent redshifted component around the position `` a '' is located outside of the mapped area by @xcite .      the ch@xmath1oh line profiles at three representative positions , i.e. ( a ) @xmath27 west of smm 2 , ( b ) smm 6 , and ( c ) smm 1 , are displayed in fig . [ metlines ] .",
    "the frequency separations between the @xmath98 @xmath99 and the @xmath100 @xmath101 lines and the @xmath98 @xmath101 and the @xmath98 @xmath99 lines correspond to 9.8 km s@xmath5 and 6.3 km s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the widest line profile is seen at the position `` a '' ( fig.[metlines]_a _ ) where the peak of the co redshifted outflow is located . at this position ,",
    "the @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 lines are blended because of the broad redshifted wings .",
    "the terminal velocity of the @xmath100 @xmath101 line reaches 13 km s@xmath5 away from the systemic velocity . the position `` a '' is located close ( @xmath102 ) to the branching point of the shocked feature seen in the _ spitzer _ image ( see fig.[cooutflow ] ) .",
    "similar blended ch@xmath1oh profiles are seen in three observed points around the position `` a '' . toward smm 6 , both",
    "the @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 lines show a blueshifted wing ( fig.[metlines]_b _ ) which is also seen in the co line ( fig.[colines]_b _ ) .",
    "no wing components are detected toward smm 1(fig.[metlines]_c _ ) where no co outflow was identified . from these results we divide the ch@xmath1oh emission into three velocity ranges ; the blueshifted component ( @xmath103 km s@xmath5 ) , the line core component ( @xmath104 km s@xmath105",
    "km s@xmath5 ) , and the redshifted component ( @xmath106 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the integrated intensity maps of the ch@xmath1oh lines are shown in fig.[metmap ] . since the distribution of the @xmath98 @xmath99 line is similar to that of the @xmath100 @xmath101 line , and these two lines are blended around the position `` a '' , we integrated all the @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101 emission over the velocity of @xmath107 km s@xmath108 km s@xmath5 with the reference frequency of 96.73939 ghz , the rest frequency of @xmath100 @xmath101 line , and made a combined map which is shown in fig.[metmap ] .",
    "hereafter we call this map `` @xmath109 map '' . the ch@xmath1oh ( @xmath110 @xmath99 , @xmath100 @xmath101 ) lines were detected around the dusty clump complex which contains smm 1 , smm 2 , smm 3 , and smm 6 .",
    "there are two peaks seen in the @xmath109 map ; one peak is located at the position `` a '' and the other peak is located around smm 6 .",

    "it should be noted that the sio column density values reported in @xcite are 1 order of magnitude lower than those derived here .",
    "this is probably because the region covered by the telescope beam used by @xcite with hpbw of @xmath150 was twice larger than that covered by our @xmath151 beam .",
    "since the size of the sio emitting region is supposed to be smaller than the beams of the single - dish telescopes , the beam - averaged column density becomes lower if the source is observed with the larger beam .",
    "in addition , most of the sources in the sample of @xcite are located further away in distance .    the narrow ( fwhm @xmath152 km s@xmath5 ) sio line as seen in smm 6",
    "was also detected in ngc 1333 @xcite , l1448-mm , and l1448 irs3 @xcite .",

    "the narrow - line component around smm 6 was detected only toward smm 6 and does not have extended distribution like the one detected around ngc 1333 @xcite .",
    "the other difference is that the distribution of the narrow sio line emission does not coincide with the high - velocity co component in ngc 1333 .",

    "the abundance of sio relative to co was estimated by comparing the column densities of these molecules .",
    "since the beam size of the sio observations is larger than that of the co , the co map was smoothed in order to match the angular resolution with the sio .",

    "this smoothing makes the derived co column density @xmath153  40 % smaller than the value without smoothing .",
    "the co spectra in the `` low velocity '' range contain the emission from the quiescent ambient material that is unrelated with the outflows .",
    "therefore in the calculation we adopted a method suggested by @xcite in which the line intensity originated from the low - velocity outflow is assumed to be the same as the line intensity at the boundary velocity between the line core and wing components ; @xmath154 km s@xmath5 and 9.6 km s@xmath5 for the blue- and redshifted outflow components , respectively .",
    "the co integrated intensities in the low velocity range are estimated by assuming the uniform intensity over the integrated velocity range , @xmath155 km s@xmath5 toward the positions along the smm 2 outflow and @xmath156 km s@xmath5 toward smm 6 . the integrated velocity range is defined to cover all the sio emissions at each position .",
    "the derived sio abundance values are summarized in table [ siocd ] .",
    "assuming [ co / h@xmath157=10^{-4}$ ] , the sio abundance relative to h@xmath8 is @xmath158 , 56 orders of magnitude higher than those measured in dark clouds ( @xmath159 a few @xmath160 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the highest sio / co abundance of @xmath161 was obtained in the high velocity component at smm 2 w3 .",
    "this abundance is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the abundance estimated toward several outflows @xcite and comparable to the abundance at the extremely high - velocity ( ehv ) jet component in the l1448-mm outflow ( @xmath162 ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a high sio abundance value and high terminal velocity ( @xmath163 km s@xmath5 , corrected for the inclination angle of 573 ) suggest that the high - velocity sio emission observed at smm 2 w3 also arises from the jet component .",
    "since protostellar outflows are considered to be the most likely mechanism to maintain the turbulent energy of the cloud @xcite , we examine the turbulent energy budget of b1 main core following the method described in @xcite . the energy - loss rate due to the turbulence decay , @xmath164 , and the energy input rate by the outflows , @xmath165 , are compared .    according to numerical studies @xcite ,",

    "on the other hand , @xmath165 is calculated under the assumption that all the outflow momentum is transferred to the turbulent motion of the cloud , @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the mass of the cloud which is accelerated up to the velocity @xmath176 , @xmath79 is the total momentum input rate by outflows , and @xmath177 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion of the clump . the total momentum flux provided by the three outflows from smm 2 , smm 6 , and smm 11 is @xmath178 km s@xmath179 .",
    "therefore , the energy input rate is calculated to be @xmath180 .",
    "this energy input rate is 1 order of magnitude smaller than the turbulence energy - loss rate .",
    "there are some uncertainties in estimating the outflow energy input rate .",
    "the first issue is the effect of optical depth of the co emission . since our calculation assumed the optically thin co wing emission , the energy input rate derived here is considered to be the lower limit .",
    "the mean opacity of the co wing emission toward 16 ysos is @xmath181 @xcite , and this value makes the energy input rate four times larger than that derived under the optically thin assumption . the second issue is the contribution of the low radial velocity component hidden in the line core .",
    "this effect becomes significant if the outflow axis is close to the plane of the sky , because most of the outflowing gas is moving along the transverse direction and shows the same radial velocity as the ambient gas .",
    "if the contribution of the `` hidden '' low radial velocity component is corrected by using the method described by @xcite , which is also used to estimate the column density of the low - velocity outflow component in section 4.1 , the resulting energy input rate becomes twice as large as that calculated using the high - velocity wing component alone .",
    "the third issue is the contribution of the outflows that were not identified in the present observations .",
    "in addition to the outflows from smm 2 , smm 6 , and smm 11 , other two outflows from smm 1 and smm 3 were identified in the co ( @xmath31 ) observations by @xcite .",
    "however , the contribution of these outflows to the total energy input is unlikely to be significant ; the momentum flux value of the smm 3 outflow is only @xmath182 km s@xmath179 @xcite , which are more than a factor of 20 smaller than that of the smm 2 outflow .",
    "in addition , the redshifted component of the smm 1 outflow is treated as a part of the outflows from smm 2 and smm11 in our calculations . in order to estimate the contribution of the weaker outflow components , we have integrated over all high - velocity component in the mapped area , and estimate the dynamical parameters of the high - velocity gas in this region .",
    "the total mass and momentum of the high velocity gas are derived to be @xmath183 @xmath16 and @xmath184 @xmath16 km s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the dynamical timescale is @xmath185 years , which is a typical timescale of the outflows in this region , the energy input rate is calculated to be @xmath186 @xmath187 .",
    "the energy input rate derived here is only a factor of 1.3 larger than that from smm 2 , smm 6 , and smm 11 outflows , suggesting that most of the mechanical energy is supplied by the three major outflows .",
    "if we take the above issues into account , the outflow energy input rate can be 1 order of magnitude higher and becomes comparable to the turbulence energy decay rate .",
    "on the other hand , the efficiency of the energy transportation would be less than unity , because the extent of the outflow from smm 2 and smm 11 has already exceeded the dense part of the b1 main core region .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the outflow energy input is not enough to maintain the turbulence in b1 main core .",
    "this result implies that the turbulence can not supply enough force against the gravity .",
    "the magnetic field in b1 was measured by @xcite to be @xmath188 @xmath46 g and @xmath189 @xmath46 g in the nh@xmath1 core ( @xmath190 ) and in the envelope ( @xmath191 ) , respectively , using oh zeeman effect .",
    "the magnetic field strength , the size and the mean density of the nh@xmath1 core in b1 are well reproduced by the magnetically supercritical , collapsing core @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the magnetic field is not able to support the core .",
    "since the mass - to - flux ratio ( @xmath192 ) is independent of the distance to the object , the difference of the distances assumed in @xcite and the present study would not essentially affect the conclusion .    since b1 is located in the perseus cloud complex which contains several active star - forming regions , it is interesting to compare the star formation in b1 with that in other star - forming regions",
    ". @xcite reported that there are eight protostars ( i.e. , class 0 and class i sources ) out of nine ysos in `` b1 tight group '' , which corresponds to the b1 main core region .",
    "since the fraction of protostars ( 8/9 ) in b1 is higher than the other star forming regions in perseus , such as ngc 1333 ( 35/102 ) and ic 348 ( 11/121 ) , they suggested that the star formation activity in b1 has recently initiated . in order to compare the turbulent energy budget in b1 with that of the more evolved star forming region ,",
    "we have calculated the turbulence supply rate and decay rate of the ngc 1333 region . in the ngc 1333 region ,",
    "six outflows were identified by the co observations by @xcite .",
    "the total momentum injection rate from these outflows is @xmath193 @xmath16 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 , which is @xmath194 times larger than that in b1 . using the velocity dispersion of 0.85 km s@xmath5 , which is derived from the nh@xmath1 observations @xcite , the energy input rate @xmath165",
    "is estimated to be @xmath195 @xmath187 in ngc 1333 .",
    "on the other hand , if we adopt the mass of the core to be 319 @xmath16 , the turbulent decay rate @xmath164 is estimated to be @xmath196 @xmath187 .",
    "these two values agree within factor of 2 , thus the outflows are powerful enough to maintain the turbulence in ngc 1333 .",
    "since @xcite assumed the lower excitation temperature of 20 k and did not apply the inclination correction , the energy input rate is underestimated compared to the case using our assumption of the excitation temperature of 50 k and the inclination angle of @xmath87 , in which the outflow momentum flux becomes a factor of 6 larger than the one originally derived by @xcite .",
    "this makes the outflow energy input superior to the turbulence energy loss .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamical simulation @xcite shows that the cloud contraction proceeds in the initial phase of the cluster formation due to the decay of turbulence and decrease of the cloud momentum .",
    "this is consistent with the observed picture of b1 main core .",
    "the cloud reaches an equilibrium state in the later phase of the simulation because of the energy input by the outflows . as their simulations ,",
    "when the outflows from the young class 0 sources in b1 have enough evolved , it might be possible that the outflows have a considerable contribution to the energy balances of the turbulence .",
    "in order to study how outflows from protostars influence the physical and chemical conditions of the parent molecular cloud , we have observed b1 main core , which harbors four class 0 and three class i sources , in the co ( @xmath0 ) , ch@xmath1oh ( @xmath2 ) , and the sio ( @xmath0 ) lines using the nro 45 m telescope . we have identified three co outflows in this region ; one is an elongated ( @xmath3 pc ) bipolar outflow from a class 0 protostar b1-c in the submillimeter clump smm 2 , another is a rather compact ( @xmath4 pc ) outflow from a class i protostar b1 irs in the clump smm 6 , and the other is the extended outflow from smm 11 .",
    "no significant outflows from other ysos were identified in our co ( @xmath0 ) map .",
    "the ch@xmath1oh emission lines are distributed around b1 main core with two peaks ; one peak is located at the position of smm 6 , toward which the ch@xmath1oh emission in the line core velocity ( 5.5 @xmath197 7.5 km s@xmath5 ) is enhanced , and the other is @xmath27 west of smm 2 , at the head of the redshifted co lobe of the smm 2 outflow , toward which the ch@xmath1oh line shows broad redshifted wing emission with a terminal velocity of 13 km s@xmath5 . in the redshifted lobe of the smm 2 outflow , the sio line also shows broad redshifted wing whose terminal velocity reaches up to 25 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the ch@xmath1oh and sio abundances are significantly enhanced at the redshifted lobe of the smm 2 outflow .",
    "it is likely that the shocks caused by the interaction between the outflow and ambient gas enhance the abundance of sio and ch@xmath1oh in the gas phase . toward smm 6 , the ch@xmath1oh and sio lines are narrow and peak at the systemic velocity , however , the abundances of these molecules are enhanced compared with those in the quiescent dark clouds . since the sio emission around smm 6 is localized at the position of the protostar , the origin of this narrow component is likely to be the shock precursor rather than the fossil outflow .",
    "the turbulence energy decay rate and the outflow energy input rate are compared to investigate the energy budget in b1 main core .",
    "it is found that the energy input rate , @xmath6 , is approximately 1 order of magnitude smaller than the turbulence decay rate of @xmath7 . even though several uncertainties that increase the energy input rate are taken into account , the outflows in b1 main core are not energetic enough to sustain the turbulence in this region . since the magnetic field is not strong enough to prevent the gravitational collapse of b1 main core @xcite , it is likely that b1 main core is gravitationally unstable .",
    "the high fraction of protostars among ysos ( 8/9 ) in b1 main core suggests that the star formation activity in this region has been started very recently . in the more evolved star - forming region ,",
    "ngc 1333 , the cloud can be supported by the turbulence driven by the outflows .",
    "these results are consistent with the picture of the cloud evolution proposed by @xcite , in which molecular clouds contract due to the decay of turbulence in the early evolutionary phase , and become stable once the energy input from protostellar outflows become sufficient enough to balance the energy loss .",

    "<S> in order to study how outflows from protostars influence the physical and chemical conditions of the parent molecular cloud , we have observed barnard 1 ( b1 ) main core , which harbors four class 0 and three class i sources , in the co ( @xmath0 ) , ch@xmath1oh ( @xmath2 ) , and the sio ( @xmath0 ) lines using the nobeyama 45 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified three co outflows in this region ; one is an elongated ( @xmath3 pc ) bipolar outflow from a class 0 protostar b1-c in the submillimeter clump smm 2 , another is a rather compact ( @xmath4 pc ) outflow from a class i protostar b1 irs in the clump smm 6 , and the other is an extended outflow from a class i protostar in smm 11 . in the western lobe of the smm 2 outflow , </S>",
    "<S> both the sio and ch@xmath1oh lines show broad redshifted wings with the terminal velocities of 25 km s@xmath5 and 13 km s@xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the shocks caused by the interaction between the outflow and ambient gas enhance the abundance of sio and ch@xmath1oh in the gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy input rate by the outflows ( @xmath6 ) is smaller than the energy loss rate ( @xmath7 ) through the turbulence decay in b1 main core , which suggests that the outflows can not sustain the turbulence in this region . </S>",
    "<S> since the outflows are energetic enough to compensate the dissipating turbulence energy in the neighboring , more evolved star forming region ngc 1333 , we suggest that the turbulence energy balance depends on the evolutionary state of the star formation in molecular clouds . </S>"
