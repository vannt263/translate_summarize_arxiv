    "i shows the state population distributions when the system is only driven by various environmental interaction decoherence strengths . when @xmath55 fs@xmath40 , decoherence is very strong as it drives more than 30% of the population out of ground state at @xmath56",
    "fs .    to examine the influence of decoherence when seeking an optimal control field , first consider a high target yield ( i.e. , perfect control with the target yield set at @xmath57 in eq.([j0 ] ) ) .",
    "the simulation results in table ii show that decoherence is always deleterious for achieving this target , but a good yield is still possible . in order to reveal the separate contributions of decoherence and the control field ,",

    "the results from optimizing eq.([j0 ] ) are shown in table iii with various levels of decoherence for a target yield of @xmath60 .",
    "the results in table iii clearly indicate that there is cooperation between the control field and the decoherence .",
    "for example , when @xmath61 fs@xmath40 , the outcome of the control field and decoherence together ( @xmath62=4.94\\%$ ] ) is much larger than outcome from control field alone ( @xmath63   = 0.63\\%$ ] ) or the decoherence alone ( @xmath58   = 0.67\\%$ ] ) , and even larger than their sum ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "table iii also shows that the control process become more efficient with increasing decoherence strength ( @xmath13 ) as the fluence of the control field is reduced while driving the dynamics to the same target .",
    "the control field spectra at different decoherence strengths are depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the mechanism of cooperation between the control field and decoherence is not easy to identify from fig.2 . in the following simple model the decoherence coefficients @xmath32",
    "are specially selected to identify the mechanism of cooperation .",
    "this model is similar with model 1 .",
    "the only difference is that the transition rates @xmath32 in eq.([lindblad ] ) are chosen to increase monotonically : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "table iv is the low target yield analog of table iii ,  but for model 2 .",
    "once again clear evidence is found for the optimal field cooperating with the decoherence . in order to deduce the mechanism of cooperation between the control field and the decoherence , fig .",
    "3 shows optimal control field spectra at different levels of decoherence .",
    "the control field consists of four peaks , corresponding to the four transitions between nearest neighbor levels . with increasing decoherence strength , @xmath13 ,",
    "the peak intensities corresponding to transitions among the higher levels , become smaller , and successively disappear . *",
    "this behavior shows that control field can be found to cooperate with decoherence and drive the dynamics more efficiently . * as a result , the cooperation between the control field and environment becomes dramatic for @xmath69 fs@xmath40 .",
    "in this region the optimal field has essentially no amplitude at the @xmath70 and @xmath71 transition frequencies such that the field alone produces a vanishingly small yield , yet with the environment present the cooperation is very efficient . if we chose the decoherence coefficients @xmath32 in eq.([lindblad ] ) decrease monotonically(not shown here ) , then with increasing decoherence strength , the peak intensities corresponding to transitions between the lower levels disappear successively .",
    "this behavior indicates a similar cooperation mechanism , but with a shift in the role of the various transitions .",
    "model 3 is similar to model 1 except that two - quanta transitions are also allowed : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 in rad@xmath39fs@xmath40 , with transition dipole elements : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 in 10@xmath78 c@xmath39 m .",
    "we also assume that there are environmentally induced two - quanta transitions : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "table v shows the outcome from model 3 with a low yield target @xmath82 .",
    "once again , cooperation between decoherence and the control field is found , although to a lesser degree than in the earlier cases .",
    "the decrease in the degree of cooperation appears mainly to arise from the enhanced target value of @xmath82 .",
    "as shown in model 1 , eventually decoherence has a deleterious effect when aiming towards a sufficiently high yield .",
    "however , under special circumstances , such as decoherence breaking the symmetry of the hamiltonian @xmath83 , decoherence could still have a beneficial role when seeking a high yield .",
    "model  4 is the more complex two - path system in figure 1(b ) . in this model",
    ", population can be transferred to the target state @xmath84 along two separate pathways .",
    "the transition frequencies , decoherence coefficients and dipoles of the left path are the same as that of model 1 ; the right path has the distinct transition frequencies : @xmath85 in rad@xmath39fs@xmath40 , decoherence coefficients : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and dipole elements : @xmath90 in @xmath45 c@xmath39 m . for simplicity ,",
    "only single quanta transitions are allowed along both paths .",
    "the results in table vi show cooperation between the field and the decoherence in model 4 for a low target yield of @xmath91 .",
    "figure 4 shows the power spectra of the three optimal control fields in table vi .",
    "panel ( a ) indicates that in the case of no decoherence the control field primarily drives the system along the right path .",
    "when decoherence is present in the left path ( panel ( b ) ) , the optimal control field chooses to drive the system dynamics along the left path in order to cooperate with the decoherence .",
    "the lack of a peak at @xmath92 in the latter case reflects the cooperation between the control field and the environment .",
    "similarly , in panel ( c ) , when decoherence is in the right path , the optimal field chooses to drive the system along the right path .",
    "these results clearly show that efficiently achieving the yield is the guiding principle dictating the nature of the control field and the mechanism in these cases .",
    "the cost function in eq.([obj ] ) explicitly contains a fluence term which naturally guides the closed - loop control search towards efficient fields , and cooperating with decoherence is consistent with this goal . the common circumstance in the laboratory of having a fixed maximum fluence would produce similar behavior toward cooperating with decoherence when it s beneficial .",
    "to illustrate the principle of how the control field can cooperate with decoherence consider excitation along a ladder ( or chain ) of nondegenerate transitions and energy levels , each linked only to its nearest neighbors as in models 1 - 2 in section iii .",
    "one can also think of this system as a truncated nonlinear oscillator@xcite .",
    "the @xmath93 level system consists of an initially occupied ground state @xmath94 , @xmath95 intermediate states @xmath96 , and a final target state @xmath97 .",
    "the states are coupled with an external laser pulse having the nominal form in eq.([et ] ) .",

    "two extreme cases of high and low target yield are chosen to illustrate distinct control behavior in the presence of decoherence : ( a ) the control field can fight against decoherence effectively when a high yield is desired , while ( b ) in the case of a low target yield , the control field can even cooperate with decoherence to drive the dynamics while minimizing the control fluence .",
    "four models were studied and a * first - order perturbation theory * of the weak control and decoherence limitis presented in this paper .",
    "models 1 and 2 considered the control of the same system in different decoherence environments .",
    "both cases show clear cooperation between the control field and the decoherence driven dynamics for low target yield .",
    "the detailed mechanistic role of decoherence can be subtle as indicated in model 1 , although the final physical impact may be simple to understand .",
    "model 2 clearly identified the role of decoherence by setting up a special structured interaction between the system and the environment . although the conclusions in this paper are based on simple physical models with the lindblad equation , similar behavior is expected for other systems and formulations of decoherence .",
    "the findings in this work are parallel with an analogous study@xcite on the role of control noise . these work aim to provide a better foundation to understand the physical processes at work when using closed - loop optimization in the laboratory , even in cases of significant noise and decoherence .",
