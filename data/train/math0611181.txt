    "the volume conjecture relates the colored jones polynomials of a knot to the simplicial volume of its complement .",
    "more precisely , let us denote the normalized @xmath0-colored jones polynomial of a knot @xmath1 by @xmath2 and let @xmath3 be @xmath4 times the simplicial volume ( gromov norm ) of @xmath5 , where @xmath4 is the volume of the hyperbolic regular ideal tetrahedron .",
    "the volume conjecture can now be stated as follows :    ( * volume conjecture * ) @xcite + for any knot @xmath1 we have : @xmath6    so far the conjecture has been proven for only the figure eight knot , torus knots , whitehead doubles of certain torus knots and connected sums of these knots , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the volume conjecture is false for many splittable links so it is unclear how to extend the volume conjecture to links . on the other hand ,",
    "the volume conjecture has been shown to hold for the whitehead link @xcite and the borromean rings @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we introduce the family of whitehead chains generalizing both the whitehead link and the borromean rings and we settle the volume conjecture for this family .    the whitehead chains are defined in terms of the tangles belt , clasp and twist depicted in figure 1 on the next page .",
    "let @xmath7 be integers such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "define the whitehead chain @xmath10 to be the closure of the composition of @xmath11 tangles of type twist ( or @xmath11 mirror images of type twist when @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 tangles of type belt , @xmath14 tangles of type clasp and @xmath15 mirror images of tangles of type clasp .",
    "the tangles belt , twist , clasp and their mirror images commute , so the order of composition is immaterial .",
    "therefore the whitehead chains are well defined . in the notation of the previous definition",
    "the whitehead link is @xmath16 and the borromean rings are @xmath17 .",
    "our main theorem is the following asymptotic expansion for the colored jones polynomial of a whitehead chain . as usual",
    "@xmath18 means that the quotient converges to @xmath19 . + * main theorem . *",
    "_ let @xmath7 be integers , such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "_ @xmath20    1 .",
    "@xmath21 .    by taking absolute values and restricting ourselves to the leading term",
    "we see that the volume conjecture holds true for @xmath22 , while it is false for @xmath23 . in the latter case",
    "the volume conjecture is true when we restrict to odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon might have something to do with the fact that the complement of the whitehead chain is hyperbolic when @xmath22 , while the torus decomposition contains a seifert - fibered piece when @xmath23 .    according to the complexified volume conjecture proposed in @xcite the value of @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 times the chern - simons invariant .",
    "for @xmath26 this is indeed the case because the chern - simons invariant is additive with respect to belted sum and its value on the whitehead link and its mirror image is @xmath27 , @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the number @xmath28 in the above asymptotic expansion is conjectured to be the number of prime factors of a knot . in @xcite a different interpretation",
    "is given in terms of the knot complement .",
    "in the same paper it is also conjectured that the number @xmath29 is determined by the ray - singer torsion of the complement twisted by the holonomy representation .",
    "we hope to investigate these conjectures for the whitehead chains in a subsequent publication .",
    "the main theorem shows that the original volume conjecture may fail even for non - splittable links , but adds credibility to the following weaker version of the volume conjecture for links :    for any non - splittable link @xmath30 we have : @xmath31",
    "in this section we give an overview of the proof of the main theorem , postponing the proofs of the more technical lemmas to the next section .",
    "the first step is to obtain an expression for the colored jones polynomials of a general whitehead chain .",
    "let @xmath7 be integers , with @xmath23 and @xmath32 .",
    "we have the following formulas for the colored jones polynomial : @xmath33 @xmath34 when @xmath0 is even and for @xmath35 we have : @xmath36 where we define @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 otherwise , and we define @xmath40 and @xmath41 by @xmath42    recall that the unnormalized @xmath0-colored jones invariants are intertwining operators of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 corresponds to the @xmath0-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath45 . using the decomposition",
    "@xmath46 one can write the unnormalized colored jones invariants of the tangles in figure 1 in the following way @xcite : @xmath47 were the function @xmath48 depends on the tangle and @xmath49 .",
    "if we define @xmath50 = \\frac{t^{\\frac{n}{2}}-t^{-\\frac{n}{2}}}{t^{\\frac{1}{2}}-t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}$ ] then the functions for the tangles in figure 1 are :    @xmath51}{[2n+1]}\\ ] ]    @xmath52    the colored jones polynomials of the mirror - images of these tangles are obtained by replacing @xmath53 by @xmath54 .",
    "the factor @xmath55 in the formula for @xmath56 is a correction due to framing that should be included only if both strands in the clasp belong to the same component . for whitehead chains",
    "this means that it should be included only when @xmath38 .    by the multiplicativity of the colored jones invariant with respect to composition of tangles we can now calculate the colored jones polynomial of all whitehead chains .",
    "the general formula for the normalized version of the colored jones polynomial of the whitehead chains is : @xmath57}{[n]}\\mathrm{t}(n , t)^a\\mathrm{b}(n , t)^b\\mathrm{c}(n , t)^c\\mathrm{c}(n , t^{-1})^d\\ ] ] the factor @xmath58}{[n]}$ ] comes from the normalization and from taking the closure of composition of the tangles .",
    "routine calculations now yield the above formulas .    from now on we will use the shorthand @xmath59 .",
    "the next step in proving the main theorem is to investigate the asymptotics of the above formulas for the colored jones polynomials as @xmath60 .",
    "the factors @xmath61 turn out to play a crucial role because they dominate the absolute value of the @xmath62-th term .",
    "there exists a unique maximum @xmath63 for the @xmath61 .",
    "this term dominates all others so that most of the asymptotics of @xmath64 can be read off from this term only . in order to make this precise we need to compare the other values of @xmath61 to the maximum value .",
    "let us choose a fixed number @xmath65 once and for all , where the numbers @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the parameters of @xmath10 .",
    "define @xmath66 and latexmath:[$k ' =    maximum .",
    "the next lemma shows how we can estimate the other values of @xmath61 .    using the above definitions of @xmath68 and @xmath69 we have:@xmath70 if @xmath71 then @xmath72 , as @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 there are @xmath75 such that if @xmath76 then @xmath77    in lemma 3 the asymptotics of the maximum value @xmath78 are expressed using the lobachevski function @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80    the asymptotics of @xmath81 is reduced to that of @xmath78 by the following lemma .",
    "by cs we mean the constant defined in the statement of the main theorem .",
    "there is a nonzero constant @xmath82 such that : @xmath83    there is a similar lemma for the case @xmath23 .",
    "we confine ourselves to the odd - colored jones polynomials , since the even ones are @xmath84 in @xmath85 . in lemma 5",
    "we reduce the asymptotics of the odd colored jones polynomial to those of the maximal term @xmath78 :    for @xmath86 and @xmath0 odd we have : @xmath87 @xmath88    postponing the proofs of these lemmas to the next subsection we can now prove the main theorem .",
    "( of the main theorem)using an explicit decomposition of the complement into ideal octahedra it can be shown that @xmath89 , see @xcite .",
    "let us first suppose that @xmath22 . according to lemma 4 there is a constant @xmath90 such that we have",
    ": @xmath91 using lemma 3 we get : @xmath92 the case @xmath23 follows in the same way by combining lemma 3 and lemma 5 .",
    "in this section we prove the more technical lemmas 2,3,4 and 5 .",
    "( of lemma 2 ) the proof of this lemma hinges on the following key estimate of @xmath61 in terms of the lobachevski function @xmath93 that was proved in @xcite . define @xmath94 . for integers",
    "@xmath95 we have the uniform estimate @xmath96 before we can apply this result we first need to show that inside the triangle @xmath97 the function @xmath98 has a unique critical point @xmath99 and reaches its maximum there , which equals @xmath100 .",

    "this will be left to the reader .",
    "( of lemma 3 ) if we define @xmath110 then we can write @xmath111",
    ". it was shown in @xcite that for @xmath112 we have @xmath113 , as @xmath60 . to prove the lemma we need to expand a little further .",
    "assuming that @xmath114 exists , we show that @xmath115 by applying the above expansion for @xmath116 three times we then find the desired expansion for @xmath78 .    to prove the expansion for @xmath116 we reason as follows : for @xmath117-\\{0,u\\}$ ] we have @xmath118 now taking the logarithm and expanding @xmath119 around @xmath120 we find : @xmath121 following @xcite p.7 we set @xmath122 and find : @xmath123 @xmath124 the term @xmath125 is the constant contribution of the sterling series used in @xcite p.7 .",
    "after integration with respect to @xmath126 we can write the above sum as a riemann sum .",
    "a computation then shows that the limit of this sum equals @xmath127 .",
    "( of lemma 4 ) for convenience we will assume throughout the proof that @xmath128 , so that the value of cs is @xmath129 .",
    "the proof in the case @xmath130 is completely analogous . according to lemma 1 the formula for the n - colored jones polynomial of the one - belted whitehead chain is @xmath131 define the quotient @xmath132 .",
    "we aim to show that @xmath133 for some nonzero complex constant .",
    "* step 1 : * by expanding the @xmath134-th power of the sum we obtain a multi - sum over all n - tuples of natural numbers @xmath135 such that @xmath136 .",
    "define central to be the set of all such tuples that satisfy @xmath137 and define far to be the set of tuples such that @xmath138 .",
    "we can then rewrite @xmath139 as follows : @xmath140 @xmath141 the far sum converges to zero absolutely , because each tuple @xmath142 in the sum contains a @xmath143 such that @xmath144 . according to lemma 2b",
    "this means that @xmath145 .",
    "we can estimate all other factors @xmath146 by a constant and conclude that the sum of absolute values of the far sum converges to zero since @xmath147 .",
    "so far we have shown that @xmath148 @xmath149    * step 2 : * in the next step we replace the factor @xmath150 in the expression for @xmath151 by a factor @xmath0 .",
    "this is done by showing that the difference converges to zero .",
    "the absolute value of the difference is less than @xmath152 for central tuples @xmath142 we have @xmath153 and hence @xmath154 .",
    "the number of terms in the sum is of order @xmath155 and the product @xmath156 is @xmath157 by lemma 2a .",
    "therefore the absolute value of the difference is at most of order @xmath158 .",
    "since @xmath159 the difference converges to zero and we have : @xmath160    * step 3 : * define the @xmath161-variable gaussian function @xmath162 and let @xmath163 . we will show that @xmath164 starting with the sum from step 2 we use lemma 2 to replace the factors @xmath165 by exponentials and error terms : @xmath166 @xmath167 to show that the error terms can be removed we estimate the contribution of their absolute values .",
    "there are @xmath155 terms in the sum so their contribution is of order @xmath168 .",
    "this converges to zero because @xmath169 .",
    "next we look at the phase factors @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we have @xmath172 . furthermore : @xmath173 since @xmath174 we have @xmath175 .",
    "if we apply this to the above sum we get the desired expression .",
    "* step 4 : * it seems natural to replace the previous sum by an integral , this is done in step 4 .",
    "we will show that @xmath176 the strategy is to estimate the absolute value of the difference between sum and integral .",
    "first we write the sum from step 3 as follows : @xmath177 where @xmath178 .",
    "the absolute value of the difference between the sum and the proposed integral above is : @xmath179 the union of the disjoint blocks @xmath180 as @xmath142 runs through central , covers the entire integration domain @xmath181 so we can subtract the integrals .",
    "however some blocks continue over the boundary of the domain of integration , resulting in a slight error .",
    "the terms @xmath142 such that the corresponding blocks @xmath180 intersect the complement of the domain will be called border terms . we can estimate the above quantity as follows : @xmath182 @xmath183 both sums will be shown to converge to zero , we start with the second one .",
    "since the number of terms on the border of the integration domain is @xmath184 and @xmath185 the second sum is of order @xmath186 .",
    "this implies that the sum converges to zero because @xmath187.for the first sum we need to estimate the integrands : @xmath188 @xmath189 the last expression is of order @xmath190 because @xmath191 and @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "we integrate over @xmath180 so @xmath194 and @xmath195 and all terms are central so @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "therefore the second sum is of order @xmath198 and thus converges to zero , because @xmath199 .",
    "* step 5 : * we make the substitution @xmath200 and @xmath201 with jacobian @xmath202 .",
    "this gives : @xmath203 @xmath204 now @xmath205 and the integrand is rapidly decreasing so the limit exists and is equal to : @xmath206    * step 6 : * in this final step we need to show that @xmath207 .",
    "we know that @xmath208 , but what about the complicated gaussian integral above ?",
    "we can write it as an iterated integral and get rid of the absolute value signs by integrating @xmath209 times over the positive hyper - quadrant @xmath210 : @xmath211 @xmath212 using the substitutions @xmath213 we get the integral below .",
    "we only want to check that the integral is nonzero so all constants in front of the integral and the jacobian are written as @xmath214 .",
    "@xmath215 if we define the complementary error function by @xmath216 , then we can write the integral more concisely as : @xmath217 @xmath218 @xmath219 after the substitution @xmath220 we note that the imaginary part of integral is nonzero , because both the exponential function and the complementary error function are bounded and decrease monotonically and the decrease is quite rapid .",
    "therefore the integral over the part where the sine is positive dominates the integral over its complement , showing that the integral is a positive scalar multiple of @xmath214 .",
    "the same proof also works for lemma 5 but in this case it is much easier because the value of @xmath221 is fixed at the maximum .",
    "the gaussian integral at the end of step 5 is now a standard gaussian integral so that the constant in front of lemma 5 can be computed easily .",
