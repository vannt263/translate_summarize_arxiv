    "in  @xcite , a photon - number states ( fock state ) feedback stabilization scheme via single - photon corrections was described and experimentally tested .",
    "such control problem is relevant for quantum information applications @xcite .",
    "the quantum state @xmath0 corresponds to the density operator of a microwave field stored inside a super - conducting cavity and described as a quantum harmonic oscillator . at each sample step @xmath1",
    ", a probe atom is launched inside the cavity .",
    "the measurement outcome @xmath2 detected by a sensor is the energy - state of this probe atom after its interaction with the microwave field .",
    "each probe atom is considered as a two - level system : either it is detected in the lowest energy state @xmath3 , or the highest energy state @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the measurement outcomes corresponds to a discrete - valued output @xmath2 with only two distinct possibilities : @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , the control inputs @xmath7 are also discrete - valued with 3 distinct possibilities : @xmath8 .",
    "the open - loop value @xmath9 corresponds to a dispersive atom / field interaction : it achieves in fact a quantum non - demolition measurement of fock states  @xcite .",
    "the two other values @xmath10 correspond to resonant atom / field interactions where the probe atom and the field exchange energy quanta : these values achieve single - photon corrections .",
    "although the feedback law proposed and implemented in @xcite considered imperfect detections on @xmath2 and delays in the control , here we focus on an ideal - set up , that is , detection errors and control delays have been disregarded .",
    "theorem  [ thm : idealconvergencegeneral ] shows that , by adding an arbitrarily small term to the lyapunov function used in @xcite , one ensures almost sure global stabilization of any goal fock state for the closed - loop ideal set - up .",
    "this is achieved by relying on an infinite - dimensional markov model of the ideal set - up that takes into account the back - action of the measurement outcome @xmath2 on the quantum state @xmath11 .    loosely speaking , in @xcite , the control value @xmath7 at each sampling step @xmath12",
    "was chosen so as to minimize the conditional expectation of the lyapunov function @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the photon - number operator , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the goal fock state . however , in closed - loop , the difference between such @xmath17 and its conditional expectation is not strictly positive : such @xmath17 does not become a strict lyapunov function in closed - loop and additional arguments have to be considered to prove convergence .",
    "these additional arguments are related to lasalle invariance .",
    "they are well established in a smooth context where the control @xmath18 is a smooth function of the state @xmath0 .",
    "this can not be the case here since @xmath18 is a discrete - valued control . in order to overcome such technical difficulties ,",
    "we propose , similarly to @xcite , to add the arbitrarily small term @xmath19 to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "this slightly modified control - lyapunov function becomes then a strict - lyapunov function in closed - loop that simplifies notably the convergence analysis .",
    "moreover , the developed convergence analysis is done in the infinite - dimensional setting in the following sense : we show that , for any initial density operator @xmath22 with a finite photon - number support ( @xmath23 for @xmath24 large enough ) , the closed - loop trajectory @xmath25 remains also with a finite photon - number support with a uniform bound on the maximum photon - number .",
    "this almost finite - dimensional behavior simplifies the convergence analysis despite the fact that such condition on @xmath22 is met on a dense subset of density operators ( hilbert - schmidt topology on the banach space of hilbert - schmidt self - adjoint operators ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ idealmodel ] presents the ideal markov model of the experimental set - up of the controlled microwave super - conducting cavity reported in  @xcite and precisely formulates the fock state stabilization problem here treated ( see definition  [ controlproblem ] ) .",
    "section  [ controlsolution ] establishes the proposed solution to the control problem in two distinct parts .",
    "firstly , section  [ diagonalcase ] considers the case where the initial condition @xmath22 is a diagonal density operator ( see theorem  [ thm : idealconvergence ] ) .",
    "only the main ideas of the convergence proof are outlined .",
    "the technical details are given in section  [ diagproof ] .",
    "afterwards , in section  [ generalcase ] , the main result of the paper is presented : the general solution is obtained from theorem  [ thm : idealconvergence ] for @xmath22 belonging to a dense subset ( see theorem  [ thm : idealconvergencegeneral ] ) .",
    "the simulation results are exhibited in section  [ simus ] .",
    "the proof of some intermediate results and computations required in sections  [ controlsolution ]  and  [ diagproof ] are presented in appendices  [ proof - properties - pk][proofdelta ] .",
