    "are considered as manifestations of the multi - component order parameter , the tunneling property of a josephson junction with these superconductors may exhibit important differences from that with one - gap superconductors .",
    "this difference is attributed to the two tunneling channels for electrons in two - gap superconductor junctions due to the presence of two condensates .",
    "this internal freedom reflects the number of electronic bands participating in superconductivity .",
    "consequently , dynamics of the relative phase of the order parameters for the two - gap superconductor tunnel junction differ from that of the one - gap superconductor junction .",
    "the presence of two tunneling channels indicates that there are two types of relative phase dynamics in a long josephson junction ( ljj ) with two - gap superconductors .",
    "these phase dynamics may be understood in terms of the interplay between the interband and conventional ( intraband ) josephson effects .",
    "the interband josephson effect describes tunneling between two electronic bands in each superconductor ( s ) layer . on the other hand",
    ", the conventional josephson effect describes tunneling between two adjacent s layers .",
    "these effects determine the dynamics of the phase difference between the condensates within the same s layer and across two adjacent s layers , respectively .",
    "the relative phase of the two condensates is fixed in the ground state .",
    "this relative phase is locked to the value of 0 and @xmath0 when the order parameter symmetry is @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . however , when the fluctuations about these phase - locked states are small , the interplay between the two josephson effects can yield interesting phenomena .",
    "one such example is a collective excitation@xcite known as the josephson - leggett ( jl ) mode .",
    "this jl mode had been observed@xcite in @xmath1 by bloomberg and coworkers , using raman scattering .",
    "also , theoretical studies of superconductor - insulator - superconductor junctions between one- and two - gap superconductors suggest that the ground state may violate@xcite the time reversal symmetry and that the phase dynamics of ljj may depend on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter.@xcite this hetero - josephson junction may be fabricated@xcite by using @xmath8 ( one - gap ) and either @xmath1 or iron - based superconductors ( two - gap ) .",
    "ota and coworkers suggested that the gap symmetry can affect@xcite the josephson current across the grain boundaries in polycrystalline samples as well as the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics of the multi - gap intrinsic ljj stacks .",
    "recent theoretical studies of hetero - josephson junction suggest that the phase dynamics of ljj are affected by the jl mode .",
    "the effects due to availability of two tunneling channels in ljj may appear in measurable physical quantities , including the drastic enhancement of the macroscopic quantum tunneling rate and the presence of an extra step structure,@xcite in addition to the conventional shapiro steps , in the i - v characteristics .",
    "a deviation from the phase - locked state in ljj may not be limited to a small amplitude .",
    "the experimental data from the magnetic response of a superconducting ring with two pseudo - order parameters indicate that a stable soliton - shaped phase difference between the two condensates ( i.e. , @xmath9-soliton ) is attainable.@xcite this observation is consistent with a suggestion that the phase fluctuations can grow and produce a stable 2@xmath0-phase texture.@xcite excitation of @xmath9-soliton represents large phase fluctuations due to the interband josephson effect and is taken as a hallmark of the multi - gap superconductors .",
    "soliton states in two - gap superconductors had been explored by a number of authors .",
    "kupulevaksky and coworkers examined@xcite this soliton state in mesoscopic thin - walled cylinders in external magnetic fields by using the ginzberg - landau approach .",
    "tanaka and coworkers suggested@xcite that interesting excitations , including a phase domain surrounded by the @xmath9-soliton wall , can arise in two dimensions ( i.e. , d=2 ) since an @xmath9-soliton may be considered as a d-1 dimensional quantum phase dislocation .",
    "the @xmath9-soliton wall may carry a fractional flux quantum when one end of the soliton wall is terminated by the fractional vortex@xcite while the other end is attached to a sample edge .",
    "also , a vortex - molecule may be formed@xcite when two fractional vortices , with a unit fluxoid quantum as the total magnetic flux , are connected by the @xmath9-soliton bond .",
    "these fractional vortices have been observed in a multi - layered superconductor@xcite by using both magnetic force and scanning hall probe microscopy .",
    "the @xmath9-solitons differ from the josephson vortices ( i.e. , fluxons ) since they do not carry magnetic flux and do not interact with either magnetic field or supercurrents .",
    "however , an @xmath9-soliton may be formed and driven@xcite by nonequilibrium charge density or by sufficiently strong superconducting currents .",
    "gurevich and vinokur suggested@xcite that spontanteous appearance of a soliton - like phase texture represents the breakdown of the phase - locked state .",
    "this breakdown can arise when the applied current density along the superconductor layers exceeds the critical value .",
    "the phase fluctuations may appear as either an additional resonances in the ac josephson effect or a static @xmath10-kink in the phase difference .",
    "if the 2@xmath0-phase texture exists in each s layer , then this @xmath9-soliton may change the phase dynamics of the ljj by inducing a critical current density modulation .",
    "earlier studies on the effects of critical current modulation indicate that both spatial and temporal dependence of josephson current amplitude may be obtained by using experimental techniques such as ohmic heating , quasiparticle injection , and illumination with an intensity modulated beam of light.@xcite also , a spatially periodic modulation of the critical current may be obtained from a periodic array of microresistors in the insulator ( i ) layer.@xcite as the microresistors behave as pinning centers for moving josephson vortices ( i.e. , fluxons ) , the speed of the fluxon becomes modulated near each microresistor .",
    "the effects of a small periodic critical current modulation@xcite created by an array of microresistors can yield a number of interesting properties , including emission of electromagnetic ( em ) radiation and josephson steps in the i - v characteristics.@xcite this suggests that the spatial and temporal periodic modulation of the critical current due to excitation of the @xmath9-solitons may exibit the same interesting property .",
    "emission of em radiation from an inhomogenous ljj had been studied by using a number of different theoretical approaches , including the green function perturbation technique,@xcite inverse scattering perturbation theory@xcite and numerical simulation.@xcite these studies reveal that a moving fluxon can radiate em waves when its speed is larger than the critical value @xmath11 .",
    "also , the interference between the emitted em waves can give rise to well - discernible steps in the i - v characteristics .",
    "this suggests that , if the critical current modulation is generated by large amplitude fluctuations of the phase difference , this may affect the junction property through the changes in the phase dynamics .",
    "these changes may be measured from the i - v curves .",
    "however , the effects of the interband josephson current on the phase dynamics of a ljj with two - gap superconductors have not yet been explored .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a quasi - one dimensional ljj ( i.e. d=1 ) with the dimensions , compared to the josephson length @xmath12 , of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "we assume that there are no fractional vortices and investigate the effects of large phase functuations ( i.e. , @xmath9-soliton ) on the phase dynamics of the ljj .",
    "we note that , here , a weak external magnetic field , applied parallel to the insulator layer , penetrates the junction in the form of fluxons . before proceeding further",
    ", we outline the main result .",
    "we find that i ) large fluctuations in the relative phase of the two condensates in each s layer via the interband josephson effect may be described by the sine - gordon equation .",
    "ii ) the soliton - like excitation ( i.e. , 2@xmath0-phase texture ) can generate both a spatial and temporal modulation of the critical current between the adjacent s layers .",
    "iii ) the critical current modulation yields emission of em waves which radiate along the junction layer in a form of quasi - linear wave .",
