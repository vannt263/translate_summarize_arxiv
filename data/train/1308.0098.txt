    "exotic nuclei containing hadrons as impurities are interesting , not only for studying hadron - nucleon interactions and changes of nuclear structures induced by the impurities , but also for investigating medium effects at finite baryon number density as modifications of the qcd vacuum . in light flavor ( up , down and strangeness ) sector , it has been studied to explore the chiral condensates as well as the gluon condensates in nuclear medium by using light hadrons as probes @xcite . as a natural extension from light flavors to heavy flavors , there have been also discussions about exotic nuclei containing charm and bottom hadrons @xcite .",
    "exotic nuclei with charm and bottom flavors will bring us new knowledge which is difficult to be accessed by those with light flavors .",
    "it is expected that they are studied in future experiments in accelerator facilities .",
    "we consider mass for the hadron and nuclear system containing a heavy quark with mass @xmath6 .",
    "it is given by @xmath7-expansion by following the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "importantly , the coefficients in the power series of @xmath7 are related to the gluon dynamics in the heavy systems .",
    "as well known , at leading order of the @xmath7-expansion ( the heavy quark limit @xmath8 ) , the system with a heavy quark obeys the heavy quark symmetry , namely the heavy - flavor symmetry and the heavy - quark - spin symmetry . at this order ,",
    "the mass of the heavy system is simply a sum of the mass of the heavy quark and the energy from the light component , namely the light quarks and the gluons .",
    "the contributions from the light component ( light quarks and gluons ) are related to the scale anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor in qcd @xcite , which is the analogue of the gluon condensate in the qcd vacuum . in the present study ,",
    "we further explore the corrections at @xmath9 in the @xmath7-expansion .",
    "it provides us with another information about the gluon dynamics . at @xmath9 ,  chromomagnetic \" gluon field",
    "is concerned with the mass splitting between a pair of spin partners , such as a @xmath10 meson and a @xmath11 meson with a heavy antiquark @xmath12 and a light quark @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , it is also known from the virial theorem that  chromoelectric \" gluon field is related to the kinetic energy of the heavy system with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "both of them are involved in the mass formula for the heavy system which is given by power series of @xmath7 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_formula ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : matrix_elements ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain the information about the gluon dynamics from the masses of heavy systems . this is a quite general procedure so that it can be applied not only to heavy hadrons but also to exotic nuclei containing a heavy quark .",
    "let us focus on the charm ( bottom ) nuclei with anticharm ( @xmath14 ) ( antibottom ( @xmath15 ) ) , which contain a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson in the ground state .",
    "we note that a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson is composed of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) with a charm ( bottom ) antiquark @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and a light quark q , and hence there is no annihilation process from light quark - antiquark pairs in nuclear medium .",
    "therefore , when the interaction between a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson and a nucleon @xmath22 is attractive sufficiently , a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson can be bound in nuclei as a stable particle against the decays by strong interactions .",
    "it decays by weak interactions and electromagnetic interactions only .",
    "theoretically , it was shown indeed that there is an attractive force ( e.g. a pion exchange force ) so that several bound and/or resonant states of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) can exist around the thresholds @xcite .",
    "the problem whether a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson is bound in nuclear matter was discussed by several theoretical approaches , the quark - meson coupling models @xcite , the qcd sum rules @xcite , the mean - field methods @xcite , the coupled - channel methods with contact interactions @xcite and the perturbative calculations by pion exchanges @xcite .",
    "the study of atomic nuclei containing a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson was also performed .",
    "there is also a discussion about the in - medium interaction between a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson and a nucleon in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "many of them suggest that @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) mesons can be bound stably .",
    "the purpose in the present study is to investigate the in - medium masses of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) mesons in nuclear matter .",
    "the previous studies about @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) mesons in nuclear matter did not give all the terms with @xmath25 in @xmath7-corrections . however , it is necessary to fully include the complete terms with @xmath25 for discussions in realistic situations , which are comparable with experimental results .",
    "furthermore , in the power series by @xmath7 for the in - medium masses , we obtain the information about the modifications of gluon dynamics as the medium effects . for the achievement of this , the correct @xmath7-expansion for the masses of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) mesons in nuclear medium",
    "is needed .",
    "we discuss the @xmath0-expansion with the heavy meson mass @xmath1 in the heavy meson effective theory ( hmet ) @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "in fact , it will turn out that the @xmath0-expansion up to @xmath26 corresponds to the @xmath7-expansion up to @xmath9 in the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "we leave a comment that , at finite density , a @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) meson is unstable in nuclear medium , because the absorption and annihilation processes are dynamically caused by light quark - antiquark pairs . in those views , we regard that @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) mesons are simple and unique objects to probe the gluon dynamics in nuclear medium .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : matrix_elements ] , we summarize briefly the mass formula with the @xmath7-expansion for heavy hadrons in the heavy quark effective theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : heavy_meson_effective_theory ] , we formulate the effective lagrangian with the @xmath0-corrections for the heavy mesons interacting with a pion by the coupling through the axial - vector current . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nuclear_matter ] , we apply the heavy meson effective lagrangian to calculate the in - medium mass of the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) meson in nuclear matter .",
    "we then discuss the modifications of effects of the scale anomaly and the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic gluon fields in nuclear matter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the application to baryons containing a heavy quark .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary and perspectives .",
    "in the heavy quark effective theory @xcite , the four - momentum of the heavy quark q with mass @xmath6 is separated as @xmath29 with the four - velocity @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and the residual four - momentum @xmath32 whose scale is much smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "then , we introduce the effective field for the heavy quark @xmath34 for the original heavy quark field @xmath35 . the effective lagrangian including @xmath9 is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 for the covariant derivative @xmath38 with the coupling constant @xmath39 and the gluon field @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) . in the third term",
    ", we define the gluon field tensor @xmath42 given by @xmath43 = ig_{\\mathrm{s } } g^{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] , and introduce the wilson coefficient @xmath44 from the matching to qcd at energy scale @xmath45 .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry ( the heavy - flavor symmetry and the heavy - quark - spin symmetry ) is conserved at @xmath46 , while it is not generally conserved at @xmath9 . in the terms with @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hqet_lagrangian ] ) , the first term breaks the heavy - flavor symmetry but still conserves the heavy - quark - spin symmetry , while the second term breaks both symmetries .",
    "the qcd lagrangian for light quarks and gluons is unchanged .",
    "based on the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : hqet_lagrangian ] ) , the mass of the hadron h containing a heavy quark q is given as @xmath47 where we define , in the rest frame with @xmath48 , @xmath49 with denoting the hadron state by @xmath50 .",
    "the factor @xmath51 is multiplied due to the normalization of the wave function . here @xmath52 is the hamiltonian obtained from the leading term in @xmath53 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chromomagnetic0 ] ) , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are operators for the spin of the heavy quark q and the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom ( the brown muck @xcite or the spin - complex @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath56 originates from the dependence of @xmath6 on the wilson coefficient @xmath44 , because the matching with qcd is done at the energy scale @xmath57 . for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lambda0 ] ) , ( [ eq : chromoelectric0 ] ) and ( [ eq : chromomagnetic0 ] ) , interestingly , there are alternative expressions given as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the chromoelectric gluon field and @xmath60 is the chromomagnetic gluon field ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the first equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) originates from the scale anomaly in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor in qcd @xcite .",
    "we introduce the gell - mann  low function @xmath62 .",
    "we ignore the finite current mass of light quarks for simplicity . in this case",
    ", the light quark fields do not appear in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , we use the state @xmath63 , which normalization factor is consistent with the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite , instead of the state @xmath50 .",
    "the choice of the normalization factor does not affect our conclusion .",
    "we may note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) is an analogue of the gluon condensate in the qcd vacuum . instead of the real vacuum as the ground state of qcd ,",
    "however , we consider the state containing a heavy quark in the present discussion .",
    "the second equation ( [ eq : chromoelectric ] ) is derived from the virial theorem as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath64 denotes the position of the center - of - mass of the system , which should coincide with the position of the heavy quark in the heavy quark limit . the third equation ( [ eq : chromomagnetic ] ) is straightforwardly obtained , because @xmath65 contains the pauli matrices @xmath66 for the heavy quark spin .",
    "thus , we find that the matrix elements @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath56 are related to the scale anomaly and the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic gluon fields around the heavy quark , respectively .",
    "this provides us with an interesting view to study the gluon dynamics .",
    "we may use heavy hadrons to probe the gluon field ( the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields ) around the heavy quarks in vacuum .    the mass formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_formula ] ) does not depend on the specific structure of heavy hadrons , when the matrix elements @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath56 are appropriately given .",
    "it can be applied to the heavy hadrons in finite temperature and/or baryon number density , as far as the energy scale of the temperature and the baryon number density is much smaller than the heavy quark mass .",
    "we can even consider possible bound / resonant states containing a heavy quark in the deconfinement phase .",
    "when the heavy hadron is embedded in the medium with temperature @xmath69 and baryon number density @xmath70 , the mass formula is given as @xmath71 where the matrix elements are defined by @xmath72 for the hadron state @xmath73 in the medium .",
    "thus , the matrix elements @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 bring us with the information about the gluon field around the heavy quark in the medium .",
    "when we know @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the medium , we immediately obtain the ratios @xmath77 in comparison with @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath56 in vacuum .",
    "these ratios tell us how the effects of scale anomaly and chromoelectric and chromomagnetic gluon fields are changed in the medium .",
    "thus , it will enable us to know the gluon dynamics in the medium in comparison with that in vacuum .",
    "the procedure is generally as follows .",
    "first , we evaluate the matrix elements @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath56 for heavy hadrons in vacuum from the mass formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_formula ] ) .",
    "second , we do the same procedure for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in medium from eq .",

    "third , by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ratio_lambda ] ) , ( [ eq : ratio1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ratio2 ] ) , we finally find the modification of the effects of scale anomaly and chromoelectric and chromomagnetic gluon fields in the medium .",
    "we note that this procedure is model - independent , because the mass formulae in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mass_formula ] ) and ( [ eq : mass_formula_density ] ) are based directly on the hqet .",
    "it will be applied also to nonuniform medium , few - body hadron and nuclear systems and so on , as far as the systems contain a heavy quark . because we concentrate on nuclear matter with zero temperature ( @xmath78 ) in the present study , for simplicity we introduce the notations @xmath79 which will be used in the following discussions .",
    "we consider @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) mesons as the simplest systems in nuclear medium .",
    "their quark contents are given as @xmath80 with a heavy _",
    "@xmath12 and a light quark q , in which the latter is indeed a non - perturbative object ( the spin - complex @xcite ) with a superposition of not only light quark - antiquark pairs and gluons like @xmath81 but also nucleon - hole pairs around the fermi surface . in theoretical analysis , the most reliable way to evaluate the matrix elements in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lambda_density ] ) , ( [ eq : chromoelectric_density ] ) and ( [ eq : chromomagnetic_density ] ) will be to solve directly the non - perturbative problems in qcd , such as in lattice simulations .",
    "however , we will discuss the in - medium effects in nuclear matter , for which the lattice simulations can not be applied yet . in the present paper , we consider the approach from the heavy meson effective theory by introducing the hadronic degrees of freedom . based on the effective lagrangian for heavy mesons ,",
    "we calculate the in - medium masses of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) mesons in nuclear matter . by fitting them to the in - medium mass formula in eq .",

    "the term from the heavy quark effective theory coincide with that from the heavy meson effective theory , because there is no heavy quark mass in both theories .",
