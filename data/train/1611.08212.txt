    "increasing the data rate in wireless networks usually comes through a larger bandwidth , or a more efficient use of the available bandwidth . in cellular applications , the performance is interference - limited in most cases , meaning that increasing the transmission power does not substantially improve the network capacity . on the other hand",
    ", separating users in the time or frequency domain leads to very inefficient usage of the available resources .",
    "the key challenge is thus to balance interference avoidance and spectrum reuse to reach an optimal trade - off between spectral and energy efficiency  @xcite .",
    "this challenge has been addressed in the past , for instance using frequency / code planning in 2g/3 g networks or with cooperative multiple point antennas in 4 g @xcite .",
    "dynamic interference management then became a strategic option to not only improve the spectral efficiency but also to achieve greater overall energy efficiency .",
    "the ia concept has been proposed first by @xcite and extended by @xcite , it gave an interesting approach for exploiting interference in a k - users interference channel ( ic ) situationthe theoretical achievements of ia have been largely discussed , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "one of the key results is that , for a number of theoretical setups , ia can transform interference limited networks into interference - free networks , regardless of the number of users @xmath0 @xcite .    in the downlink cellular network ,",
    "the ia extension has been addressed in several research works , e.g. @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed to form clusters of base stations ( bss ) assuming a global knowledge of channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "as results , only users in the center of clusters benefit from slight data rate improvementother results showed questionable performance gains and several limitations @xcite . among the major issues",
    "is that ia sacrifices half of the space dimensions in order to avoid interference for every user in the cluster , whereas some of them may not suffer strong interference .",
    "more efficiently , suh _ et al . _ in @xcite proposed a dynamic precoding scheme that attempts to balance the performance gain of matched filtering for the best users with ia for cell - edge users . by using a fixed rank - deficient precoding step at the transmitter , each bs",
    "can ensure that users always see a subspace in their effective channel where interference is reduced or eliminated .",
    "the idea is that each mobile measures and feeds back its own free subspace to its main bs , which jointly schedules the ues so as to maximize the overall capacity .",
    "this scheme is particularly attractive in the context of dense cellular networks because with ia and thanks to channel properties , the freed subspace perceived by interfered mobiles is different for each of them . and",
    "hence , it becomes more probable to find users for which optimal transmission spaces are quasi - orthogonal as the size of the network increases .",
    "therefore , by performing simultaneously users scheduling and precoding , the bs highly increases the chance to maximize the system capacity .",
    "the aforementioned ia scheme only assumes to feedback the interference - free direction .",
    "however , the additional signal directions may also present a low interference level due to fading on the interfering channel .",
    "therefore , we propose that in addition to the interference - free directions , the users feed back alternative directions , which increases the number of candidate directions at the bs and makes the scheduler more complex . in this paper , a heuristic scheduling process is proposed to decrease the algorithmic complexity while preserving near - optimal performance .",
    "moreover , we focus on a numerical evaluation of the ia performance compared to the matched filtering ( mf ) .",
    "surprisingly , our simulations show that the ia technique gains interest when the crossed channels are correlated while the mf technique performs the best in the uncorrelated case scaling up linearly with the signal - to - interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "notations : boldface upper case letters and boldface lower case letters denote matrices and vectors , respectively .",
    "the superscripts @xmath1 stands for the transpose conjugate matrices , respectively .",
    "@xmath2 denotes the identity matrix of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 norm is denoted as @xmath5 .",
    "a downlink cellular network with @xmath6 bs and @xmath7 user equipments ( ues ) in the @xmath8 bs is considered .",
    "the @xmath9 ue in the @xmath8 bs receives @xmath10 streams .",
    "all bss and ues are equipped with @xmath11 antennas .",
    "the transmission scheme is based on a mimo - ofdm with @xmath0 available sub - carriers yielding a total @xmath12 dimensions for the transmitted signal , in both frequency and spatial domain .",
    "a complex matrix @xmath13 of dimension @xmath14 is used at each bs ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the data symbols at a given bs are carried out , each by a precoding vector @xmath16 ( @xmath17 denote the user , the bs , and the stream indices , respectively ) , and then further precoded using @xmath13 .",
    "independent flat fading channels are assumed for all subcarriers .",
    "the transmitted signal of the @xmath8 bs is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 contains the data for each of the @xmath10 streams of user @xmath20 in bs @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 complex precoding matrix of user @xmath20 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , @xmath13 is assumed the same for all bss with elements selected as @xmath24  a truncated fourier or hadamard matrix being a good candidate in practice .",
    "the condition @xmath25 in @xmath13 means that the transmit signal at each bs occupies a reduced signal space of dimension @xmath26 and leaves the rest @xmath27 dimensions free .",
    "the maximum number of streams in the reduced space of a given cell is @xmath28 and the dof is equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the received signal at the @xmath9 ue of the @xmath8 cell is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the direct channel matrix between the @xmath8 bs and the @xmath32 ue , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the @xmath35 complex circularly symmetric additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) vector with zero mean and covariance matrix equals to @xmath36 .",
    "each ue has perfect knowledge of at least the direct channel linking it to its main bs , and of its main interferers through some pilots as described e.g. in @xcite . in traditional transmission schemes ,",
    "the model is nothing but except that @xmath13 is an identity matrix .",
    "this means that all dimensions are exploited at the expense of strong inter - cell interference at cell - edges , which results in poor performance . by using a truncated , rank - deficient @xmath13",
    ", the bs can save some available dimensions to let the other bss in the neighbors serve their users in an interference - free subspace .",
    "this technique allows each ue to have @xmath27 interference - free streams .",
    "the decoded signal at user @xmath20 of the @xmath8 bs is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the direct equivalent channel between @xmath9 user and the @xmath8 bs .",
    "in @xcite , two ia schemes have been proposed , assuming only one stream per user .",
    "the first scheme is based on a zero - forcing ( zf ) criterion .",
    "this means that each ue estimates the interfering channels and calculates the decoding matrix as their null space vector , i.e. @xmath39 collapses to a vector @xmath40 verifying : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of interfering bss to be canceled .",
    "the basic case is obtained for @xmath43 which holds for the strongest interferer .",
    "each user calculates the equivalent channel @xmath44 given in ( [ eq3 ] ) and feeds it back to its bs , which in turns apply a scheduler that selects a subset of users to serve .",
    "the selected users have their equivalent channels denoted @xmath45 collected in a matrix as @xmath46 $ ] , and then a zf beamforming scheme is applied to compute orthogonal transmission vectors avoiding intra - cell interference in , @xmath47 = \\bm{\\bar{c}}_{m}^{\\dagger}\\left(\\bm{\\bar{c}}_{m}\\bm{\\bar{c}}_{m}^{\\dagger}\\right)^{-1}.\\ ] ] each precoding vector is normalized to ensure a constant power : @xmath48 .",
    "the second scheme exploits a minimum mean square error ( mmse ) criterion and takes into account the interference - plus - noise ( in ) covariance in addition to the strongest interferer properties .",
    "the decoding vector is given by : @xmath49 assuming the knowledge of the strongest interferer channel , the in covariance @xmath50 is @xmath51 with @xmath52 the total transmit power , @xmath53 the remaining interference , and @xmath54 $ ] the precoding matrix of the @xmath55 bs .",
    "the initial vector @xmath56 can be selected so as to maximize the beamforming ( bf ) gain at the receiver , and chosen as the eigenvector associated to the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath57 . as can be seen from ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] )",
    ", one major difference comparing to the first scheme is that the interference - free subspace is no longer fixed and becomes dependent on the precoder choices of other bss .",
    "however , in practice , we consider that in average , @xmath58 approaches an identity matrix because of the zf bf step .",
    "the strict reduction of the coding space with the matrix @xmath59 can also be relaxed using a full square matrix with the last @xmath27 columns weighted by a factor @xmath60 .",
    "the motivation behind introducing the factor @xmath61 is to be able to tweak the rank - deficiency of @xmath13 and color the interference space @xcite .",
    "this approach gives more flexibility in the coding strategy and allows to adapt to situations where pure interference alignment is not necessary and may be outperformed by interference management .",
    "the new mixing matrix @xmath59 is given by @xmath62,\\ ] ] where the vectors @xmath63 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "the above ia schemes minimizes the dimensions lost in the signal space of each bs thanks to the controlled freed dimensions . while achieving a high snr gain",
    ", it only assumes a stream per user , which severely restricts the dimensions of the problem . in many practical situations , we observed through simulations how this lack of diversity limits the system performance .",
    "indeed , in each cell , some users are close to their main bss and do not suffer from strong interference . in this case",
    ", it appears more efficient to let the user feeds back not only the interference - free signal direction but also additional directions presenting a sufficiently high overall sinr . by letting each user to feed back several directions ,",
    "the scheduler has more flexibility to optimize the coding scheme .",
    "each ue first selects the optimal directions that maximize the received sinr , with inter - cell interference only .",
    "the decoder is initialized as @xmath64 .",
    "the equivalent channel is then given by @xmath65the optimal receive directions are computed using the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath44 , with eigenvalues @xmath66 and eigenvectors @xmath67 defined as @xmath68 where the elements of @xmath66 are sorted in decreasing order , meaning that the first columns of @xmath67 provide the optimal receiving directions and may be used as decoding directions . in order to maximize the received sinr ,",
    "the decoding matrix is chosen as @xmath69 , and the precoding matrix as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of selected streams for a given user .",
    "the resulting sinr of the @xmath72 stream can be easily found equal to @xmath73 the @xmath72 element of @xmath66 .      motivated by the fact that some users may not suffer a high interference level , we suggest that each user feeds the best @xmath74 directions calculated in ( [ eq10 ] ) back to its bs . in this way , ues in the center of the cell preferably feed back decoding directions corresponding to strong eigenmodes of the direct channel , whereas cell - edge users feed back interference - minimizing directions . for the sake of consistency , the cell and user indexes",
    "are omitted in the upcoming equations .",
    "each user thus feeds back a set of candidate decoding directions @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the optimal coding direction and the sinr for the @xmath72 stream , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath77 gain does not take into account the intra - cell interference , and indirectly is only an estimate of the sinr in the direction @xmath76 .",
    "when a bs serves only one user , the directions @xmath76 are mutually orthogonal , and thereby there is no intra - cell interference . in the multi - user mimo case , the directions for two different users , e.g. @xmath76 and @xmath78 are not necessarily orthogonal , which adds an extra interference power of @xmath79 . in order to cancel the intra - cell interference , we may call for a zf - based precoding scheme as given in ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "however in doing so , the precoders are no longer perfectly aligned with the optimal receive directions , which introduce a potential rate loss in the network overall performance .",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 break    the set of all candidates @xmath89 is built by collecting all @xmath90 streams candidates from all users . assuming a dense network scenario where @xmath90 is much greater than the number of available streams @xmath91 , each bs has to select the best candidates in order to maximize a utility function defined as the sum - rate ( with eventually fairness weights , see below ) .",
    "the optimal way is to apply an exhaustive search and to select the best subset @xmath92 that results in the highest sum - rate .",
    "the optimization problem is defined as@xmath93where @xmath94 is a given candidates streams subset , and @xmath95 is a per - ue weight updated after each transmission in order to provide fairness among the different ues . since",
    "several directions are fed back per user , the dimensions of @xmath96 increase exponentially , which in turns makes the optimal scheduling challenging as the network grows .",
    "the optimization problem in ( [ eq12 ] ) is in known as np - hard , and its computational cost may be written as @xmath97where cost@xmath98 is the complexity cost of a zf precoding scheme .",
    "it is quite clear that for dense scenarios , the search among all candidate streams is not feasible .",
    "we rather propose a sub - optimal heuristic scheduling , that greatly decreases the complexity while preserving a near - optimal performance .",
    "for a given bs , the heuristic privileges the streams that provide higher rates and less inter - correlation .",
    "let us denote @xmath99 the stream with the highest rate among all @xmath90 streams . at iteration @xmath100",
    ", we define the set of the chosen streams as @xmath101 , the set of the remaining streams as @xmath102 , and the utility function as @xmath103 given in ( [ eq12 ] ) . at the @xmath72 iteration , the utilities for @xmath104 are @xmath105 and the stream @xmath106 with maximum utility is selected .",
    "the sets of remaining and chosen streams are updated according to @xmath107 the algorithm stops when no more gain can be achieved . in ( [ eq14 ] ) , @xmath108 is the fed back direction for a given stream , and @xmath109 results from the zf precoding scheme applied on the vectors of @xmath110 .",
    "looking at the computational cost of the heuristic algorithm given in alg.[heuristic ] , we can readily see that the complexity is polynomial and the cost search process is upper - bounded by @xmath111 since only two loops are required .",
    "the performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated through exhaustive simulations in different load scenarios .",
    "a system level simulator with @xmath112 cells is used , each cell being divided in @xmath113 sectors . for the exposed results , we only consider the center cell in which the ues are uniformly distributed , although all cells support users and compute their precoders accordingly .",
    "we assume a proportional - fair scheduling by updating the scheduling weight of each user as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a threshold under which any rate is assumed null , and @xmath116 is the average number of bits transmitted until the @xmath9 transmission .",
    "the spectral efficiency is compared to that of a classic ofdm scheme as a reference , where all interference are considered as noise . in this paper ,",
    "@xmath117 users per cell in average are considered , and an overall coding space limited to @xmath118 dimensions with @xmath0 available sub - carriers and @xmath11 antennas at the bss and the ues .",
    "our system level simulator assumes a regular placement of bss and random users in full buffer .",
    "more information about the propagation model used here is given in @xcite ( cf gt doc2a ) .",
    "the performance are evaluated for both channel correlation levels : low and medium , with a correlation coefficient equal to @xmath100 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "a simplified resource block structure is adopted to save computation time , the channel is abstracted as : @xmath0 sub - carriers with independent fading matrices , and each @xmath120 fading matrix includes correlation .",
    "each ue feeds back @xmath121 preferred receive directions . by assuming @xmath118 and",
    "@xmath122 free dimension at each bs , the bs chooses @xmath123 streams to be served using ia with scheduling based on alg.[heuristic ] .",
    "the capacity is truncated to a maximum of @xmath124 bits per resource use .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations are run for @xmath125 independent scenarios .",

    "[ fig2 ] a significant gain in the low to medium sinr region , e.g. the gain varies between @xmath129 bits / s / hz at sinr @xmath100db depending on the parameter @xmath61",
    ". however , it decreases for high sinr because users are no longer suffering strong interference . comparing to the mf based scheme where each bs exploits all dimensions leaving no free dimension for adjacent cells ,",
    "a gain is only observed for very low sinr values i.e. sinr@xmath130db . beyond this value",
    "the mf scheme has an increasing gain specially for high sinr , where it also enjoys an almost constant gain over the ofdma scheme .",
    "this means that due to channel diversity , a ue can frequently find a direction with low interference .",
    "the performance of the ia scheme for @xmath131 and @xmath132 are similar except that a slight gain is observed for sinr@xmath133db .",

    "similar observations have been made for the mimo - ofdm configuration with @xmath136 and @xmath137 . except that in this case , the schemes with higher @xmath61 always result in a se gain .",
    "this means that the low - interference modes are basically created by the block diagonal channel , and are almost independent of the precoding design .",
    "contrarily to the uncorrelated configuration , in @xmath138 correlated channel with a factor of @xmath119 between the antennas and @xmath137 uncorrelated subcarriers , the performance are surprisingly different as shown in fig .",
    "for example , the ia schemes for different @xmath61 greatly outperform the mf scheme for all sinr values , and result in significant gains compared to the ofdm scheme in the low - to - medium sinr region .",
    "this means that since all modes are correlated , an almost interference - free mode does no longer exist unless it is freed . and",
    "hence , the performance are degraded . however , comparing the ia scheme with different @xmath61 , it can be seen that @xmath139 results in a rate - loss for sinr@xmath140db , and yields a gain beyond @xmath124db since more dimensions are available for precoding .",
