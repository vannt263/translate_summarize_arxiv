    "it is easier to compute the solution of a eikonal equation of the form @xmath20 ( boundary conditions considered later ) , where @xmath21 are functions such that at each @xmath22 the matrix @xmath23 is the inverse of the positive matrix @xmath24 at each point @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 denotes the derivative of @xmath27 with respect to the variable @xmath28 . in general",
    "we shall write @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 for the multivariate derivative with multiindex @xmath32 .",
    "the connection between the length of a geodesic which is given in local coordinates as in , and the length function @xmath33 defined by equation is considered in section 2 . this way",
    "the problem of finding the length of a geodesic is reduced to solving a nonlinear first - order partial differential equation in some domain of euclidean space .",
    "the computation of @xmath33 is still far from trivial , however . even if the data @xmath34 are analytic functions , power series expansion typically lead to power series solutions for @xmath33 with small radius of convergence .",
    "hence , the question is how we can approximate the function @xmath33 globally .",
    "moreover , for some applications such as the accurate computation of diffusions we need the approximation of @xmath33 in strong norms ( sobolev norms of form @xmath35 for possibly any positive real @xmath36 . for that matter recall that @xmath37 and that for any @xmath38 we may define @xmath35 to be the set of all tempered distributions @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is a function in @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the pseudo - differential operator with symbol @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 @xmath45 denoting the fourier transform .",
    "the goal of the present paper can then be formulated as follows : find for each @xmath46 and each real @xmath47 @xmath48 an approximative solution @xmath49 to such that @xmath50 we shall call @xmath51 an @xmath35 approximation to @xmath52 for reasons which will become apparent later . let us motivate this ambitious task by looking at a specific application .",
    "there are a lot of applications for computations of the length of a geodesic , where applications to computations in general relativity are only one domain .",
    "another important example is the leading term of the expansion of the fundamental solution of linear parabolic solutions ( with variable coefficients ) .",
    "varadhan showed that the fundamental solution of the diffusion equation @xmath53 ( where the diffusion coefficients @xmath54 and the first order coefficients @xmath55 in depend on the spatial variable @xmath25 only ) is connected to the length @xmath56 of the geodesic with respect to the line element @xmath57 ( @xmath58 being the inverse of @xmath54 ) via the relation @xmath59    solving equation we can assume that the matrix - valued function @xmath60 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath61 for all @xmath62 .",
    "this is because @xmath63 so we can always substitute the matrix @xmath54 by its symmetrization @xmath64 without affecting the solution @xmath52 .",
    "in @xcite we have seen that for @xmath65 coefficient functions @xmath21 and @xmath66 and if some boundedness conditions of the derivatives are satisfied the fundamental solution has the pointwise valid form @xmath67 where the functions @xmath68 are solutions of recursively defined linear first order equations for each @xmath69 .",
    "these equations can be solved by methods of characteristics or approximated by regular polynomial interpolation methods outlined in @xcite . in the computation of the wkb - coefficients @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath70 the recursive relations for @xmath71 involve second order derivatives of @xmath72 , and therefore implicitly derivatives of order @xmath73 of the squared metric @xmath33 .",
    "hence it is of great interest to compute not only @xmath33 but also its derivatives up to a given order with high accuracy .",
    "the present work shows how his can be accomplished .",
    "in section 2 we recapture some facts about the connection of the geodesic equation , and equation , and prove global existence , regularity and uniqueness of the latter ( family ) of equation(s ) leading us to theorem 2.3 .",
    "then in section 3 we provide further analysis of the family of eikonal equations which lead us to local representations of the solution . in section 4",
    "we construct first a weak approximation of the solution ( in @xmath74 sense ) , and then extend this to a recursive construction of an @xmath35-approximation . in section 5",
    "we provide error estimates by using geometric information .",
    "section 6 points out how the method may be applied for accurate approximation of diffusions , and we finish with a conclusion in section 7 .",
    "we shall only sketch the connection between geodesics and the eikonal equation .",
    "it is almost standard , and details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our interest here is that the eikonal equation together with careful chosen boundary conditions has a global and unique solution .",
    "we shall have two different arguments for uniqueness : one is via uniqueness of an associated diffusion and wkb - representations ( or , alternatively , varadhan s result , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but we will have the same insight from an other point of view when we look at local representations of the solution in the next section .",
    "we consider riemannian manifolds where any two points can be connected by a minimal geodesic . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to consider manifolds which are geodesically complete .",
    "recall that a riemannian manifold @xmath9 is geodesically complete if for all @xmath4 the exponential map @xmath75 is defined globally on @xmath76 . here",
    ", @xmath76 denotes the tangential space of the manifold @xmath9 at @xmath4 .",
    "the hopf - rinow theorem provides conditions for riemannian manifolds to be geodesically complete .",
    "especially we have    for a riemannian manifold @xmath9 the following statements are equivalent :    * @xmath9 is complete as a metric space . *",
    "the closed and bounded sets of @xmath9 are compact .",
    "* @xmath9 is geodesically complete .",
    "each of these equivalent statements implies that geodesics are curves of shortest length .",
    "moreover , if @xmath9 is geodesically complete , then any two points of @xmath9 can be joined by a minimal geodesic .",
    "the connection between the arclength and equation can be established as follows .",
    "first equations for minimal geodesics are obtained from variation of the length functional .",
    "second hamilton - jacobi calculus shows that the length functional satisfies the eikonal equation . since this is known we only sketch the main steps for convenience of the reader . setting the variation of the length functional to zero we get @xmath77 with @xmath78 and where we use einstein summation .",
    "parameterizing by arclength , i.e. setting @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) we get @xmath81 which , upon multiplcation by @xmath82 ( entries of inverse of @xmath83 ) and rearranging becomes the geodesic equation , . in order to show on the other hand that the squared length functional satisfies we may consider the length functional @xmath84 and invoke hamilton - jacobi calculus .",
    "this is done by introducing the variables @xmath85 , and the associated hamiltonian defined by @xmath86 ( here and henceforth we use einstein summation if convenient ) . then we may write @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 . and compute @xmath90 then we may connect @xmath91 to @xmath92 by computing @xmath93 by invoking the canonical system of equations .",
    "this leads to @xmath94 and a similar equation with respect to the variables @xmath25",
    ". then we get the equations for @xmath95 and @xmath33 , i. e. the equations and below .",
    "recall that a minimal geodesic is a global distance minimizing geodesic .",
    "this minimal geodesic which connects @xmath25 and @xmath69 characterizes the riemannian distance @xmath96 in an obvious way",
    ". moreover smoothness of @xmath97 for smooth diffusion and drift coefficients @xmath98 follows from the following fact about ordinary differential equations .",
    "let @xmath99 be a smooth map .",
    "consider the differential system @xmath100 where @xmath25 is a map @xmath101 .",
    "then for each point @xmath102 there exists a neighborhood @xmath103 of this point and @xmath46 such that for @xmath104 equation ( 2.69 ) has a unique solution @xmath105-\\epsilon,\\epsilon[\\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}^n$ ] with initial conditions @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ". moreover , the map @xmath108-\\epsilon,\\epsilon[\\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}^n$ ] defined by @xmath109 is smooth .    finally we get    let @xmath110 be some domain .",
    "the function @xmath111 ( the leading order term of the wkb - expansion of a parabolic equation with diffusion coefficients @xmath54 ) is the unique function which satisfies the equations @xmath112 @xmath113 for all @xmath114 and with the boundary condition @xmath115 moreover , the squareroot @xmath56 is the riemannian distance induced by @xmath116\\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}^n \\mbox { is piecewise } \\\\ & \\mbox { smooth with $ \\gamma(a)=x$ and $ \\gamma(b)=y$}{\\bigg \\}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the function @xmath33 is a @xmath65-function with respect to both variables .",
    "the variation of the length functional leads to the geodesic equation . on the other hand ,",
    "hamilton - jacobi calculus leads us to the fact that the squared length functional @xmath33 satisfies the equation .",
    "it is clear that the squared length functional satisfies both equations and below .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the squared length functional satisfies the initial condition .",
    "uniqueness is a bit more subtle . in @xcite varadhan",
    "showed that @xmath117 where @xmath91 is the fundamental solution of a scalar parabolic equation with diffusion coefficient function @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath91 is unique for a strictly parabolic equation @xmath33 is uniquely determined by the equation . on the other hand",
    "one knows that for small @xmath118 @xmath119 has for @xmath65 coefficients a representation of type is valid ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . plugging this into the correspondend parabolic equation leads to the eikonal equation which is , hence , satisfied by @xmath33 .",
    "moreover we know by @xmath120 and the fact that the squareroot of @xmath33 is a metric .",
    "hence @xmath121 if and only if @xmath122 , and the same holds for @xmath33 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the global solution @xmath33 of the system of equations , and is unique .",
    "moreover , from the preceding theorem we can conclude that the function @xmath123 is also smooth with respect to both variables .",
    "next we observe that the local representation of the solution of the equations , with the boundary condition has a local representation which starts with the quadratic terms .",
    "this will be used in the construction of a global approximation .",
    "the analysis presented here gives us two other insights .",
    "first , a powere series ansatz leads atmost to local and not to global solutions . even if there is a local power series representation of the solution at each point of the domain",
    ", we do not know how a global solution can be constructed from this information , because we do not know the location of the geodesic the length of which we want to compute .",
    "if we knew , then computing the length would be a rather trivial task .",
    "even the derivatives of the length functional would be better computed from the explicit geodesic . however , as we mentioned the nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing the geodesic is harder to solve in general than the eikonal equation .",
    "second , we shall see from an different point of view why the boundary condition leads to uniqueness of solutions @xmath123 of the system , , and .",
    "we have    the local representation @xmath33 satisfying the equations , , together with the boundary condition is of the form @xmath124 the coefficients @xmath125 are uniquely determined by a recursion obtained from the equations , . in coordinates with second order normal form ,",
    "i.e. where @xmath33 is @xmath126 with @xmath127 is the spectrum of @xmath128 , the multiindex recursion is @xmath129 this confirms uniqueness .",
    "( note that there is no loss of generality if we choose the normal coordinates for the second order terms ) .",
    "in general the solution is not globally analytic in the sense that @xmath33 is not representable by a globally converging power series .",
    "a smooth solution @xmath33 of the eikonal equation has the representation @xmath130 we abbreviate @xmath131 since @xmath132 we have @xmath133 the only if-condition of the boundary condition leads to @xmath134 . to see this assume that @xmath135 . since @xmath136 there is a small @xmath137 such that @xmath138 and @xmath139 for some @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "hence there exists some @xmath141 such that with @xmath142 @xmath143 contradicting one part of the boundary condition @xmath144 .",
    "next one computes that @xmath145 satisfies the equation @xmath146 and the uniqueness of theorem 2.3 .",
    "( which we established by arguing with uniqueness of related diffusions and varadhan s result , in the atiyah - singer spirit of short - range analytic expansions ) identifies the coefficients @xmath147 as the second order terms of local representations around @xmath69 .",
    "having obtained this the representation is just a multivariate version of taylor s theorem .",
    "note , however , that we do not need to invoke the uniqueness of theorem 2.3 . but just consider a recursion obtained from a power series ansatz starting with second order terms .",
    "however , this would complicate the matter a bit so we take advantage that we know the second order terms of a local representation by the preceding argument .",
    "finally we have to establish the recursion in .",
    "the recursion shows directly that the higher order coefficients @xmath148 for @xmath149 are uniquely determined .",
    "moreover , it is clear from that in general the convergence radius of the full power series is small ( if not zero ) .",
    "hence in general there is no globally analytic solution the function @xmath150 globally analytic if for each @xmath151 the taylor expansion of @xmath33 at @xmath151 and @xmath152 equals @xmath33 globally , i.e. @xmath153 invoking the implicit function theorem equation is equivalent to @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the spectrum of the positive @xmath23 . since @xmath156",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath157 the latter equation is easier but there is no taylor expansion around @xmath69 as can be seen in the case of constant coefficients ( and hence constant eigenvalues @xmath158 ) , where the solution is @xmath159    we use equation mainly for the theoretical purposes of this corollary . in general it can not be in general used for numerical purposes since this would imply that we have an efficient procedure to compute the eigenvalue functions of a space dependent matrix .",
    "since we are looking for high precision in this paper , this is not possible in general .",
    "an exception is the case of dimension @xmath160 where we have @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "next we plug in the power series expansion @xmath163 we have @xmath164 where for any multiindex @xmath165 we define @xmath166 the term @xmath167 is defined analogously .",
    "plugging in the power series ansatz and using the relation @xmath168 , this leads to    @xmath169    this leads to @xmath170 simplifying and renaming multiindices in order to collect for multiindices of order @xmath165 we get @xmath171 the latter equation leads directly to .",
    "let us draw some consequences out of our theoretical considerations .",
    "there is neither an explicit solution nor leads a power series ansatz to a global solution in general .",
    "neither does it help to have local solutions in terms of power series .",
    "such representations are not sufficient for our purposes , since we are interested in a global solution for @xmath172 and do not know the intermediate points on the corresponding geodesic in order to compute the global @xmath33 by means of local power series representations .",
    "this motivates our later construction of regular polynomial interpolation of @xmath33 as seemingly unavoidable .",
    "for the moment let us denote again an interpolation polynomial which approximates the squared riemannian distance @xmath33 in the @xmath74-sense on some bounded domain @xmath173 by @xmath174 and one that approximates the squared riemannian distance @xmath33 in the @xmath35-sense ( again on @xmath173 ) by @xmath51 .",
    "how can we check that a given polynomial is an approximation in either sense ?",
    "the equation gives us itself a hint how an approximation @xmath51 of @xmath33 performs . in order to obtain the @xmath74 error of an @xmath74 approximation @xmath175 of @xmath33",
    "we may plug in the approximation @xmath51 into the right side of equation and subtract the left side , i.e. we compute @xmath176 we shall see that @xmath177 locally ( with @xmath178 the mesh size of the interpolation points ) implies that @xmath179 converges to zero as the number of interpolation points @xmath180 goes to infinity in such a way that the mesh size of the set of interpolation points @xmath178 goes to zero . note that @xmath181 denotes the squareroot of @xmath174 .",
    "we call an approximation @xmath49 an @xmath35-approximation if it approximates not only @xmath33 in the @xmath74 sense but can be plugged in into all the derivatives of of order @xmath182 ( i.e. multivariate derivatives @xmath183 for @xmath184 of the eikonal equation ) such that in @xmath185 the right side staisfies @xmath186 locally implies that @xmath187 converges to zero as the number of interpolation points @xmath180 goes to infinity in such a way that the mesh size of the set of interpolation points @xmath178 goes to zero .",
    "accordingly , we call such @xmath174 ( @xmath51 ) an @xmath74- ( @xmath35 ) approximation of the boundary value problem . in the next subsection",
    "we construct a @xmath74-approximation and refine the construction in the following subsection in order to construct @xmath35-approximations .",
    "we may write the eikonal equation @xmath189 assume that @xmath190 is constant .",
    "the solution with the boundary condition @xmath191 iff @xmath122 is @xmath192 where @xmath193 , and @xmath194 denotes the inverse of the matrix @xmath195 .",
    "this is easily verified by observing that @xmath196 define @xmath197 we get the first recursively defined approximation algorithm for the riemannian distance based on @xmath198 interpolation points @xmath199 .",
    "note that the squared distance is a function @xmath200 where we define @xmath201 .",
    "there are several ways to approximate the function @xmath33 . in order to approximate this function",
    "we approximate first the function @xmath172 , then the function @xmath202 and so on up to @xmath203 .",
    "we start with the approximation of @xmath172 .",
    "first define @xmath204 next define @xmath205 and determine a real number @xmath206 such that @xmath207 i.e. the eikonal equation with respect to @xmath25 and fixed parameter @xmath69 is satisfied at @xmath208 .",
    "proceeding we get a series @xmath209 of approximations of the form @xmath210 having determined the real numbers @xmath211 we obtain the real number @xmath212 by solving @xmath213 for @xmath212 . continuing this procedure for @xmath180 interpolation points",
    "we get a polynomial of the form @xmath214 with @xmath180 real numbers @xmath215 obtained recursively by plugging in @xmath216 with one degree of freedom @xmath215 into .",
    "analogous constructions are done to approximate @xmath217 for @xmath218 with @xmath219 with @xmath220 computed analogously .",
    "the construction of the functions @xmath221 suffices to approximate @xmath33 ( we do not need to synthesize these functions into one function , for example by a lagrangian polynomial interpolation ) . note that for @xmath222 the function @xmath223 satisfies the equation @xmath224 at all interpolation points @xmath225 by construction .",
    "note that in the preceding construction no restrictions on the choice of the interpolation points are made .",
    "this does not mean that one may search for an optimal choice of interpolation points and improve efficiency and convergence .",
    "we are free to choose a certain set of interpolation points ( for example chebyshev nodes ) .",
    "but these are purely computational aspects which will be exploited elsewhere .",
    "note that we have constructed an approximation of the squared metric @xmath33 .",
    "the metric @xmath56 is then approximated naturally by the squareroot of the approximation of the squared metric , i.e. we consider the function @xmath226 to be the approximation of the metric function @xmath227 .",
    "we refine the construction of the preceding section by construction of an approximation which solves not only , ( or the set of equations , with boundary conditions ) , but also all multivariate derivatives of up to a given order @xmath182 at the interpolation points .",
    "it turns out then that these polynomials are @xmath35-approximations for @xmath228 .",
    "the approximation is constructed recursively again . for a multiindex @xmath165 of order @xmath229",
