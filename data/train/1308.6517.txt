    "we calculated a constant offset component in the optical coming from the host galaxy in the aavso data and the data from @xcite and @xcite using the data of @xcite as a reference and subtracted the averaged difference over the overlapping periods .",
    "we assumed a spectral shape of @xmath23 for small corrections of non-@xmath21-band fluxes ( @xcite ; fig.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "first , we see that the observed visibilities and the corresponding implied ring - radii were rather stable from 2003 to 2010 .",
    "this is despite the significant change in the central engine s flux , including a long - term increase from @xmath02006 , especially by a factor of a few from 2008 to 2010 @xcite .",
    "then , our interferometric observations in 2012 show evidence for a decrease of the visibility , implying an increase in the radius of the dust sublimation region in ngc4151 .",
    "the measured radius increase is at a @xmath02.4 @xmath17 level , which is the formal significance of the difference in the deduced radii calculated from the 1-@xmath17 uncertainty of each radius determination ( table  [ tab_obs ] ) .",
    "this increase in radius seems to have happened with an apparent delay of at least a few years from the significant flux increase seen especially from @xmath02008 to 2011 . for the other multiply",
    "observed targets , namely 3c273 , mrk231 , akn120 , and mrk509 , we have not detected any significant variation in the size estimates in one to three year intervals . finally , the sizes as a function of luminosity for the sample combined with other targets observed with the ki and also with the vlti are discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the possible variation in visibility seen in ngc4151 .",
    "according to the accumulated interferometric observations of ngc4151 and the compiled flux measurements , the radius of the innermost dust distribution has apparently receded in response to the heating flux increase with a significant time delay .",
    "the observed delay implies that the overall timescale for the destruction of the innermost dust distribution is at least a few years .    in fig.[fig_hysteresis_ngc4151 ]",
    ", we also plotted near - ir reverberation radii .",
    "these radii have overall increased from the 1970s ( time lag of @xmath018 days ) to the 1990s ( @xmath035 days ; @xcite ) or the 2001 - 2006 period ( @xmath050 days ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radius also seems to have decreased within the latter 20012006 period , which was found by @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "we re - analyzed the data of @xcite and used the peak in the cross - correlation function to measure lags , rather than the centroid ( which is adopted by koshida et al . ) .",
    "this ensures the consistency with the other reverberation measurements by @xcite and those implemented and compiled by @xcite .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.[fig_hysteresis_ngc4151 ] .",
    "we found slightly shorter lags with larger uncertainties ( see sect.4 of @xcite ) , but the tendency of the decreasing radius is still roughly consistent with that found by @xcite .",
    "the long - timescale increase of the radius from the 1970s to the 1990s and its subsequent decrease possibly seen in the 2001 - 2006 period could well be due to the historical flux increase peaking around 1996 ( fig.[fig_hysteresis_ngc4151 ] ) and the subsequent significant decrease in the flux .",
    "the former probably destroyed grains in the innermost region , and the latter lead to the reformation of the dust grains in the same region .",
    "if this is the case , there must have been quite a long delay of several years between the decrease in flux and that in the reverberation radii measured in the 2001 - 2006 period .",
    "this could , in principle , constrain the dust reformation timescale , implying that it might have taken several years for the innermost dust grains within a @xmath00.05  pc radius region to re - form .",
    "this reformation timescale was indeed already inferred by @xcite .",
    "note that here we talk about the destruction of the dust _ distribution _ , but not necessarily the microscopic destruction of each grain .",
    "this distribution radius does not seem to be changing sensitively to the _ instantaneous _ change in the incident heating radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is also shown in fig.[fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath24 , where we plot the measured radii against the instantaneous incident flux ( in practice , we calculated the flux averaged over the past half a year from the radius measurement ) .",
    "the radius does not show the expected @xmath5 dependence ( as already found by @xcite ) , which is given by the relationship between the reverberation radius and luminosity over a _",
    "sample _ of objects @xcite and shown as the dashed line in fig.[fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath24 .",
    "this probably means that the innermost dust grains are in the optically - thick accumulations or clouds so that only the dust grains at the surface region sublimate first @xcite .",
    "this would slowly be followed by the increase of the overall radius of the distribution when the incident flux level is persistently kept high .",
    "one simple model to quantify the possible destruction and reformation of the dust distribution is to postulate that the distribution radius is approximately determined by the average of the incident flux over some past period , or an average retro flux .",
    "the retro flux at a given observing time of a radius measurement is set by averaging the optical flux over the past @xmath25 years back from the radius observing time . the reformation time and destruction time of the dust distribution",
    "are not necessarily the same , with the former likely being longer than the latter . here",
    ", we take the simplest first approximation to use a single averaging timescale @xmath25 , which can be regarded as an overall mean of the two timescales .    calculating the deviation from the square - root proportionality and also the spearman",
    "s rank correlation coefficients between the radius and retro flux , we searched for the best value of @xmath25 for the compiled flux and radius measurements , finding it to be @xmath0 6 years ( fig.[fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath26 ) .",
    "here we calculated the deviation from the square - root proportionality for reverberation radii using the @xmath5 fit by @xcite , and the deviation for interferometric radii by fitting a @xmath5 relation separately .",
    "this is because we anticipate the latter radii to be slightly but systematically larger than the former .",
    "more specifically , the reverberation measurement using the peak of the cross - correlation function tends to probe the fastest responding material @xcite , i.e. give a radius close to the inner boundary radius , while the interferometric radius represents an overall average radius of the brightness distribution , thus slightly larger than the reverberation radius .",
    "this difference between the interferometric and reverberation radius has been seen in other different objects @xcite .",
    "similarly , we calculated the rank correlation coefficient separately for the two different radii .    figure  [ fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath27 shows the radii as a function of the retro flux for the case of @xmath25 = 6 years .",
    "the reduced @xmath28 for the deviation from the square - root proportionality has a minimum of 1.8 at this @xmath25 ( fig.[fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath29 ) .",
    "the confidence level of rejecting a null hypothesis for the correlation between the interferometric radii and the retro flux has a peak of 93% ( or 1.8 @xmath17 ) at this @xmath25 , while the rank correlation coefficient for the reverberation radii becomes positive only at @xmath30 years though not with a high confidence level ( fig.[fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath31 ) .",
    "all these indicate that the radius is relatively well correlated with the _ long - term average _ of the incident flux rather than the instantaneous flux , and consistent with being proportional to the square - root of the _ long - term average _ luminosity . finally , figure  [ fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath27 also suggests that the interferometric radius is larger than the reverberation radius by a factor of @xmath01.8 for a given retro luminosity in this agn .",
    "@xcite have already pointed out that , in their light curves between 2001 and 2006 , the reverberation radius in the early part ( @xmath02001 ) seems to be affected by the past bright flux .",
    "indeed , we see the historical peak around 1996 ( see fig.[fig_hysteresis_ngc4151 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is better to put the data into a perspective covering a much wider time range . with the analysis done here , we indeed find a likely timescale of @xmath06 years , rather than the one - year time scale suggested by @xcite .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fig_radlum_ngc4151]@xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "we can relate this dust timescale @xmath25 to the radial uv optical thickness of the sublimation region , or more specifically , @xmath32 over the inner radial length scale of @xmath00.05  pc in this agn .",
    "this is coarsely given as @xmath33 , where we denote the ( microscopic ) dust destruction timescale as @xmath34 , within which the region of uv optical thickness unity will be destroyed when flux is increased .",
    "the dust evaporation occurs when the dust vapor pressure dominates the ambient dust gas pressure , and the destruction timescale @xmath34 can roughly be estimated as a function of the dust vapor pressure @xmath35 and the dust temperature @xmath36 .",
    "this is given as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath37^{-1}\\\\ & \\simeq & 4.7 \\times 10^{1 } \\left ( \\frac{a}{0.1 \\ \\mu { \\rm m } } \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{t}{t_0 } \\right)^{1/2 } \\left ( \\frac{p_{\\rm vap}}{p_0 } \\right)^{-1 } \\",
    "{ \\rm ( days ) } ,   \\label{eq_tdest}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the radius of dust grains assumed to be spherical , @xmath38 the dust molecular mass , @xmath39 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath40 the bulk density of a dust particle .",
    "here we normalized @xmath36 by @xmath41=1400  k , which is the typically observed color temperature of the dust sed in the near - ir and adopted here as a proxy for the actual temperature of sublimating grains ( see more below on the temperature ) .",
    "we used the values of @xmath38 and @xmath40 for silicate grains , but adopting the @xmath38 and @xmath40 values for other grains does not change the order of magnitude of the estimated @xmath34 .",
    "the estimation is more sensitive to vapor pressure @xmath42 .",
    "we normalized this by the constant @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 , with @xmath46=@xmath47 @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 dyn @xmath50 ( see more below on the density ) , because silicate grains give @xmath51@xmath0@xmath43 , adopting constants from the literature @xcite .",
    "the vapor pressure as a function of @xmath36 is given as @xmath52 , where the constant @xmath53 depends on the dust species and @xmath53@xmath0@xmath54  k for silicate grains , and is thus , very sensitive to @xmath36 .",
    "however , we can still use a fixed temperature for this estimation as long as @xmath34 is shorter than the flux variation timescale , which seems to be the case here ( see eq.[eq_tdest ] ) . note that the observed near - ir color temperature is probably a lower limit for the actual temperature of sublimating grains , and thus @xmath34 can even be shorter .",
    "thus , we have @xmath55 therefore , the region is estimated to be very optically thick over the radial length scale of @xmath00.05  pc .",
    "this is consistent with the general expectation from the optically thick equatorial obscuration .",
    "conversely , in order to have such a high optical thickness , the destruction timescale @xmath34 must be tens of days ( recall @xmath33 ) , and this requires the vapor pressure @xmath35 to be on the order of @xmath43 .",
    "this corresponds to the sublimation at @xmath01400  k in the case of silicate grains . in the case of graphite grains , adopting constants again from the literature @xcite , they should be sublimating at a higher temperature of @xmath01800  k , at which they have @xmath35@xmath0@xmath43 .",
    "this vapor pressure in the sublimation region also implies that the ambient density of gas - phase dust constituents is on the order of @xmath010@xmath56 @xmath48 ( denoted as @xmath46 above ) , corresponding to the hydrogen number density of @xmath010@xmath57 @xmath48 for the normal ism abundance .",
    "it is worth noting that this density is comparable to that estimated for the broad - line region .",
    "it is certainly true that the inference and discussions here are based on a limited number of radius measurements .",
    "further near - ir interferometric observations of this well - monitored object will certainly be yielding .",
    "based on the available optical light curve , we can actually predict that such measurements in the coming few years will show a large radius similar to what we measured in 2012 .",
