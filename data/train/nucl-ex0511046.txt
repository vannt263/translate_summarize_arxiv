    "one of the most celebrated results from the first three years of rhic is the suppression of single high - p@xmath0 particle production in central au+au collisions due to jet suppression  @xcite .",
    "the effect of jet suppression was dramatically seen in two - particle correlations where the away - side jet in central au+au collisions was largely extinguished  @xcite and its shape modified  @xcite .",
    "these observations are consistent with calculations from parton energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung when the parton traverses a medium with a large gluon density of @xmath2 1000  @xcite .",
    "further , the same single particle suppression and away - side jet suppression is not present in d+au collisions  @xcite meaning that it is the final state interactions in the central au+au collisions that suppress the jets . with the recent high - statistics au+au and",
    "cu+cu runs it is becoming possible to do more detailed studies of the away - side jet modification with two - particle correlations .",
    "two - particle correlations are measured in the phenix central spectrometer arms and are defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the event pair distribution and the @xmath5 are the mixed event distributions where each particle of the pair is chosen from a random event .",
    "the mixed event distributions correct for the non - uniform pair acceptance of the phenix central arms .",
    "these correlation functions can be turned into a pair per trigger distribution , @xmath6 where the normalization is dependent on the acceptance and the efficiency  @xcite .",
    "two particle correlations exhibit two peaks at @xmath7=0 ( near ) and @xmath7=@xmath8(away ) which represent correlations within the same jet and between di - jets respectively . in a+a collisions elliptic",
    "flow is also present which causes a harmonic modulation of the isotropic background .",

    "the outgoing di - jets are acoplanar , not back - to - back .",
    "acoplanarity of the di - jets can be determined by the angle between the jets . assuming independent fragmentation one can write @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angle between the fragments of the di - jets , @xmath12 is the angle between the fragments of the jets , and @xmath13 is the angle between the di - jets .",
    "these three angles are statistically independent and so one can find @xmath14 the terms on the right side are fixed by the rms widths of the near- and away - side correlations",
    ".    in d+au collisions multiple scattering , which is responsible for cronin enhancement  @xcite , should increase this acoplanarity of the di - jets .",
    "[ fig : sinsq ] shows the difference of @xmath15 in d+au and p+p collisions as a function of the trigger @xmath16 where the trigger is either a charged ( squares ) or neutral ( circles ) pion .",
    "these data are consistent with no difference between p+p and d+au , which constrains the amount of di - jet broadening from the cold nuclear medium at rhic .",

    "[ fig : aacorr ] shows an example of a cu+cu @xmath17-h correlations in the 10% most central events .",
    "these correlations are normalized so that the vertical scale is the signal - to - background of the jets .",
    "there is a large s / b and the near- and away - side jet distributions are observed .",

    "[ fig : aacorr ] also shows high-@xmath16 @xmath17-h correlations in au+au collisions for the 20% most central collisions where the away - side jet observable at 20% s / b .",
    "we extract the away - side widths and compare them to the widths from p+p and d+au collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aawidths ] ) .",
    "the widths are consistent between p+p and au+au for this @xmath19 range .    at lower momentum ( @xmath20 5 gev )",
    "the jet shape becomes modified such that a local minimum appears at @xmath7=@xmath8 .",
    "this has spurred theoretical interest in mach cones or cerenkov - like radiation  @xcite as possible physical mechanisms which could produce such a structure .",
    "experimentally we study this shape quantitatively by parameterizing the away - side shape as two gaussians with similar width but offset symmetrically about @xmath7=@xmath8 by a splitting angle d. @xmath21 fig .",
    "[ fig : auausplit ] shows the angle d as a function of @xmath22 for different low-@xmath16 h - h correlations .",
    "there is a smooth increase of d at peripheral collisions to an apparent saturation at central collisions .",
    "we also observe that the lowest @xmath16 combination is systematically higher than the two higher @xmath16 ranges .",
    "low-@xmath16 correlations have also been performed in cu+cu at @xmath23 = 200 gev and au+au at @xmath23 = 62 gev .",
    "these correlations exhibit the same away side shape structure as seen in au+au .",
    "[ fig : sysenersplit ] shows the same d parameter as a function of @xmath22 for the different collision systems .",
    "all of the systems follow @xmath22 scaling and , within errors , the angle d is independent of colliding energy .",
    "an ideal probe for the jet modification in medium is the use of prompt @xmath1-h correlations .",
    "phenix has shown a factor of 2 excess of photons above the hadronic decay background above 5 gev / c in the most central au+au collisions consistent with prompt @xmath1 production as calculated by pqcd  @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed inclusive @xmath1-h correlations .",
    "the near angle region of these correlations are populated by decay and prompt @xmath1 triggers .",
    "[ fig : gammatopi0yieldratio ] shows the associated particle yield per trigger in the near - side from inclusive @xmath1 triggers compared to @xmath17 triggers .",
    "one sees a decrease in the ratio with centrality consistent with the fraction of prompt-@xmath1 increasing at the higher centralities .",
    "phenix has measured jet correlations in p+p , d+au , cu+cu , and au+au at low- and high-@xmath16 .",
    "little difference between p+p and d+au di - jet acoplanarity is seen .",
