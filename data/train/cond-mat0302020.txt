    "compounds that are poor electrical conductors or insulators often exhibit charge patterns which differ from the homogeneous charge distribution encountered in ordinary metals .",
    "the charge ordering often occurs at a relatively high temperature and is accompanied by a magnetic ordering at a lower temperature .",
    "these phenomena are quite generic , as they are observed in a variety of systems .",
    "important examples are the three - dimensional nickelates , the layered cuprates at specific commensurate fillings , layered molecular crystals such as bedt - ttf radical salts and quasi  one  dimensional systems such as the organic tmttf and dcnqi compounds . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the full long - ranged coulomb potential should in principle be included when dealing with _ any _ interacting insulating phase , due to the ineffectiveness of screening .",
    "accordingly , it is not surprising to find wide classes of apparently different compounds showing similar behaviours in their insulating phases . in this respect , the possibility that the two phenomena of charge and spin ordering share a common origin is very appealing .",
    "yet , it is not obvious that the two separate energy scales can be described within the same physical mechanism .",
    "this raises the question of determining a set of unambiguous signatures of the long - range coulomb interactions , to be compared with the experiments .",
    "one such signature is of course charge ordering itself , as was first recognised by wigner in the framework of the three - dimensional electron gas.@xcite in the low - density limit , the kinetic energy of the electrons becomes negligible and the charges arrange themselves in the form of a _ wigner lattice _ which minimizes the electrostatic energy .",
    "however , it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the observed charge modulation is induced by long  range forces or by an instability of the fermi surface .",
    "moreover , even if the main driving mechanism is given by the coulomb forces , the presence of other effects ( elastic , magnetic ) in real compounds can strongly modify the predicted ordering pattern .    when applying the idea of wigner crystallization to electrons in narrow - band solids , we are faced with the additional constraint that the charges must sit on the sites of a discrete lattice ( the _ host _ lattice of atoms , to be distinguished from the wigner crystal of electrons ) .",
    "this has been pointed out by hubbard,@xcite who considered the extreme limit of zero bandwidth , a sensible starting point if the dominant energy scale is set by the interactions .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a variational treatment which allows to go beyond the classical limit by including the effects of quantum fluctuations .",
    "our results indicate that for small but finite hopping parameters , the charge and spin degrees of freedom are energetically decoupled : charge crystallization , governed by the ( large ) coulomb energy , naturally gives rise to antiferromagnetic spin correlations , characterised by a much smaller energy scale .",
    "the coexistence of charge and spin ordering at low energies can thus be considered as distinctive of dominant long  range coulomb interactions , and should therefore be ubiquitous in the insulating phases of strongly interacting systems .",
    "it can be argued that for special fillings , short - range models with one or few interaction parameters ( e.g.  the hubbard model for half  filled bands , or the extended hubbard model for quarter  filled bands ) can give a correct description of the system .",
    "although they give the right answer for the ground state charge configuration for special fillings , the strong  coupling analysis presented here shows that these models can no longer be applied as soon as the filling deviates from such special values , since in this case they do not yield the proper classical ground state ( a system with purely local interactions is metallic away from half  filling ) .",
    "therefore , a complete understanding of the behaviour of the insulating phases as a function of the density can only be achieved by taking into account the long range part of the coulomb potential .",
    "we study a system of fermions in one dimension , interacting via a local repulsion @xmath4 and a long  ranged coulomb potential @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the distance between electrons .",
    "the corresponding tight  binding hamiltonian on an l - site ring is @xmath7 where we have defined the following dimensionless operators , describing respectively electron hopping , on  site and long  range repulsion , @xmath8 @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron of spin @xmath11 at site @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the occupation number of this state and @xmath2 is the hopping amplitude between nearest ",

    "one  dimensional compounds .",
    "the limit studied by hubbard@xcite is obtained by setting the bandwidth to zero and @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the problem is classical ( but still non  trivial ) , and corresponds to minimising the interaction energy by distributing the @xmath15 electrons as homogeneously as possible over the @xmath16 available lattice sites .",
    "the difficulty arises from the competition between the different interaction parameters @xmath17 .",
    "if the potential is convex , as in the coulomb case , a solution can be found for any commensurate filling @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 integers ) in the form of the generalized wigner lattice ( gwl ) , a periodic sequence of unit cells of size @xmath20 , each containing @xmath19 electrons distributed according to a minimum spread of interelectron distances .",
