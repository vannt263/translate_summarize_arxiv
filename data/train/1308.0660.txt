    "many important classical spin models such as the ising model and the potts model are described as probability distributions of spin configurations . to investigate the behavior of such models numerically , we normally design monte carlo methods , and obtain samples from the model using random numbers",
    ". however , there is no reason in principle to use randomness for obtaining samples ; it does not matter whether the samples are generated randomly or deterministically , if the samples properly represent the probabilistic models in question .",
    "chaotic boltzmann machines recently proposed in ref .  @xcite have chaotic billiard dynamics that yields samples from ising spin - glass models without any use of random numbers .",
    "they have been numerically shown to have computing abilities comparable to conventional ( stochastic ) boltzmann machines . in this paper",
    ", we further numerically investigate the capabilities of the chaotic billiard dynamics as a deterministic alternative to random monte carlo methods for classical spin models .",
    "although there have been no studies that utilize billiard dynamics for deterministic simulations of spin models , the following three streams of studies can be considered as closely related to the present study .",
    "firstly , several deterministic cellular automaton models for the ising model have been proposed .",
    "the q2r automaton @xcite is the simplest automaton model of the ising model , and it evolves conserving the energy exactly .",
    "creutz @xcite proposed another automaton model in which demons are introduced as additional degrees of freedom .",
    "demons absorb and release energy at each site conserving the total energy . despite the simple and deterministic update rules , these models reproduce the probabilistic behavior of the ising model .",
    "however , these automata can not be directly regarded as deterministic samplers from the ising model ; in the q2r automaton , spin configurations only move on a microcanonical ensemble , and in the creutz automaton , the system temperature is internally determined .",
    "although chaotic boltzmann machines are not automata , there is a similarity to the creutz automaton in the sense that the additional degrees of freedom introduced allows the system to deterministically generate samples from canonical ensembles .    secondly , spin models based on coupled map lattices ( cmls ) @xcite have been proposed @xcite .",
    "cmls are typically composed of discrete - time chaotic elements on a lattice interacting with each other . they are known to exhibit rich spatio - temporal nonlinear dynamics , and form an important class of dynamical systems with a large number of degrees of freedom . by associating symbols to partitions in the state space of each element",
    ", cmls can be regarded as deterministic ising - like spin models . in the sense that the probabilistic behavior of ising spins is realized by chaotic dynamics",
    ", cml - based spin models can be related to chaotic boltzmann machines . however , each element constituting chaotic boltzmann machines has continuous - time and non - chaotic dynamics .",
    "thirdly , it should be noted that random numbers used in conventional monte carlo simulations on ordinary computers , i.e. , pseudo - random numbers , are deterministically generated .",
    "therefore , in a sense , we have already been using deterministic monte carlo methods . of course ,",
    "such pseudo - random numbers are designed so that they can be regarded as truly random in many aspects .",
    "since monte carlo methods rely on truly random numbers , it is crucial to use good random numbers in principle .",
    "however , the generation of good random numbers is costly , and this is one important issue in large - scale monte carlo simulations .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out @xcite that low - quality pseudo - random numbers can actually be used in monte carlo methods and may even improve the performance .",
    "thus , it is controversial as to the quality of randomness actually required .",
    "it is also noteworthy that recently a deterministic sampling algorithm , which is called herded gibbs sampling @xcite , was proposed on the basis of the herding algorithm @xcite . although the algorithm is not practical for large - scale simulations , it is theoretically far more efficient than conventional monte carlo methods . thus , it is intriguing to explore what is possible with deterministic monte carlo algorithms , and chaotic boltzmann machines can be regarded as one of the approaches to the problem .    with these motivations in mind , in this paper , we numerically investigate the capabilities of the chaotic billiard dynamics as a deterministic alternative to random monte carlo methods by applying it to classical spin models in statistical physics .",
    "we confirm that the billiard dynamics can yield samples that converge to the true distribution of the ising model , and we show that the phase transition point and the critical exponents of the ising model are correctly obtained . furthermore , we extend the billiard dynamics to spins that take more than two states , and we apply it to the potts model and the xy model .",
    "we also point out that the billiard sampling dynamics is reversible and can be a good example for discussing the microscopic origins of irreversible macroscopic behavior on the ising model .",
    "it is to be noted that although the term `` monte carlo '' may imply that the algorithm is probabilistic , we intentionally keep using this term for deterministic algorithms also , thereby indicating that they can be used exactly in the place of conventional monte carlo methods .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce the implementation of probabilistic spin models by billiard dynamics .",
    "although we limit the description to the ising model , it can be extended to arbitrary ising spin - glass models or boltzmann machines @xcite .",
    "let us consider the ising model composed of @xmath0 sites on a lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian for a spin configuration @xmath1 of the ising model is given by @xmath2 where the summation is taken for all the adjacent pairs in a lattice .",
    "the probability distribution of the spin configurations of the ising model is given by the gibbs distribution @xmath3 = \\frac{1}{z}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{t}e(\\bm{\\sigma})\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the temperature and @xmath5 denotes the partition function given by @xmath6    for large spin systems , it is difficult to evaluate the probability and directly obtain the samples . to obtain samples from the probability distribution ( [ eq : gibbs ] ) , we normally use monte carlo methods . here",
    "we consider the heat - bath algorithm , which is also known as gibbs sampling in the field of machine learning .",
    "we choose a spin @xmath7 from @xmath8 randomly or sequentially .",
    "for each chosen spin , we update the state according to the probability @xmath9 = \\frac{\\exp(\\sum \\sigma_j / t)}{\\exp(\\sum \\sigma_j / t)+\\exp(-\\sum \\sigma_j / t)},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the configuration of the spins in the system except for the @xmath7th spin .",
    "this process defines a markov chain having the gibbs distribution ( [ eq : gibbs ] ) as the stationary distribution .",
    "therefore , we can eventually obtain a sample sequence from the gibbs distribution .    here",
    ", we consider using billiard dynamics instead of the heat - bath algorithm for sampling from the gibbs distribution ( [ eq : gibbs ] ) .",
    "we introduce an internal state @xmath11 $ ] for each node @xmath7 .",
    "the internal state of the @xmath7th node evolves according to the following differential equation : @xmath12 the state of the @xmath7th node @xmath13 changes when @xmath14 reaches @xmath15 or @xmath16 as follows : @xmath17 note that @xmath14 decreases when @xmath18 and increases when @xmath19",

    "( [ eq : dx ] ) and ( [ eq : switch ] ) is a hybrid dynamical system @xcite on the state space @xmath20^n$ ] , because it has both discrete and continuous state variables .",
    "the differential equation ( [ eq : dx ] ) is designed to be consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) in the following sense .",
    "we assume here that the states of the neighboring nodes of the @xmath7th node are fixed .",
    "then , @xmath14 oscillates between @xmath15 and @xmath16 periodically . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dx ] ) , it takes @xmath21 unit time for @xmath14 to move from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and it takes @xmath22 unit time for @xmath14 to move from @xmath16 to @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the period is @xmath23 unit time , in which the state @xmath13 takes on @xmath15 for @xmath21 unit time .",
    "therefore , the probability that we observe @xmath18 at a random instant is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "note that this consistency is derived under the assumption that the states of the neighboring nodes are fixed .",
    "since the states in the system actually change , this is merely an explanation that justifies eq .",
    "( [ eq : dx ] ) only intuitively .",
    "it is expected but not assured that @xmath24 follows the gibbs distribution ( [ eq : gibbs ] ) .    in the explanation above , it is only essential that the relative time duration for which @xmath13 takes on @xmath15 in a period coincides with the probability @xmath25 $ ] defined in eq .",

    "[ fig : tempsize](a ) ) , all the definitions appear to work similarly , so that we mainly employ only eq .",
    "( [ eq : dx ] ) in this paper .",
    "we also note that implementations are not limited only to these three types .",
    "for instance , arbitrary constants different from site to site can be multiplied to the speeds .",
    "there are two views on the dynamics of this system .",
    "if we focus on each node in the system , the internal state @xmath14 continues oscillating between @xmath16 and @xmath15 , interacting with the neighboring nodes . in this sense",

    "( [ eq : dx ] ) , and changes its direction when it collides with the boundary of the hypercube according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : switch ] ) . in this sense",
    ", the dynamics of this system can be regarded as pseudo - billiard @xcite .    unlike deterministic spin models implemented by cmls",
    ", each node does not have chaotic dynamics .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that chaotic behavior naturally emerges from the interactions in the system , and it is considered to work as a heat - bath to realize probabilistic behavior of the spin configurations    statistics of the ising spin model can be obtained from the continuous - time billiard system in the following manner .",
    "let @xmath33 be the sequence of times at which state switchings occur according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : switch ] ) .",
    "then , the expectation value of a statistic @xmath34 can be estimated from the samples until time @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the state that the system is taking on in the time interval from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "thus , in a sense , we obtain a sample sequence @xmath41 weighted by time intervals @xmath42 .",
    "the statistics are calculated in this manner in the present study .",
    "another method to obtain a ( unweighted ) sample sequence is to observe @xmath43 uniformly , at every one unit time for example , or randomly . note that sampling from a continuous - time billiard system is analogous to sampling with continuous - time ( kinetic ) monte carlo algorithms such as the bortz ",

    "although the billiard dynamics is described as a continuous - time system , numerical calculation can be carried out by iterating the poincar map @xmath44 induced on the boundary of the hypercube @xmath45^n$ ] as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite . hence , when the system temperature is low and the spins seldom flip , the simulation performs efficiently , in a manner similar to continuous - time monte carlo algorithms",
    ". however , it is generally less efficient on ordinary computers compared with the ordinary heat - bath algorithm  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we numerically verify that the billiard dynamics yields samples that converge to the true distribution of the ising model on a small lattice , for which probability distributions can be computed .     with the periodic boundary condition at temperature @xmath46 .",

    "the errors sometimes stop decreasing , which may be due to symmetries in these small systems composed of uniform units .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath54 , two units in diagonal positions receive exactly the same inputs from two other units in the other diagonal positions . since it can be intuitively understood that the dynamics can be easily limited to a subspace if all the units are uniform , we perturbed the speeds and confirmed the convergence as expected .    figure  [ fig : tempsize](c ) shows the average absolute errors at different temperatures @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for @xmath49 .",

    "therefore , we consider future studies on the theoretical foundations of the sampling dynamics to be also important on the basis of the promising results presented in this paper .",

    "<S> it has recently been shown that the computing abilities of boltzmann machines , or ising spin - glass models , can be implemented by chaotic billiard dynamics without any use of random numbers . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we further numerically investigate the capabilities of the chaotic billiard dynamics as a deterministic alternative to random monte carlo methods by applying it to classical spin models in statistical physics . </S>",
    "<S> first , we verify that the billiard dynamics can yield samples that converge to the true distribution of the ising model on a small lattice , and we show that it appears to have the same convergence rate as random monte carlo sampling . </S>",
    "<S> second , we apply the billiard dynamics to finite - size scaling analysis of the critical behavior of the ising model and show that the phase transition point and the critical exponents are correctly obtained . </S>",
    "<S> third , we extend the billiard dynamics to spins that take more than two states and show that it can be applied successfully to the potts model . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possibility of extensions to continuous - valued models such as the xy model . </S>"
