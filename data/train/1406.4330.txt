    "diradical species @xcite play an essential role in molecular systems , from organic reactions like cycloadditions @xcite to chemical processes of biological interest like the thermal isomerization of the retinal chromophore involved in the mechanism of vision @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the reaction pathway can move through a transition state of diradical character .",
    "archetypal examples are the dimerization of butadiene @xcite and the reaction between butadiene and ethylene @xcite , in which diradical transition states are supposed to be energetically competitive with aromatic ones . as example , the ground state potential energy surface of the retinal chromophore,@xcite and of its reduced model@xcite on which the thermal isomerization occurs , is characterized by two different branches , one with a charge - transfer character and the other of diradical character . to quantitatively define the energy landscape of such paths , very high level calculations are necessary , including an adequate treatment of both static and dynamic electronic correlation . on the other hand , determining the relative stability of singlet and triplet states can represent a challenging task for theory even for small molecules like the tetramethyleneethane@xcite .",
    "spin multiplicity is also a fundamental ingredient in the design of magnetic materials involving diradical species , like zn - expanded oligoacenes .",
    "@xcite + according to salem and rowland s definition @xcite , a diradical species is a molecule with two unpaired electrons occupying two ( near-)degenerate molecular orbitals .",
    "molecules with a broken double bond represent a model for diradicals .",
    "one of the simplest cases is the torsion around the double carbon - carbon bond of ethylene , c@xmath7h@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite drifting away from the planar structure to the orthogonally twisted conformation , the bonding @xmath2 orbital and the anti - bonding @xmath3 orbital of the singlet ground state become degenerate and a single - configuration @xmath9 wave function is not appropriate anymore to describe the electronic state : the orthogonally twisted ethylene represents the prototype of the homosymmetric diradical .",
    "@xcite standard density functional theory ( dft ) and restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) approaches indeed fail even in the qualitative description of the shape of the torsional barrier ( cusp at 90  instead of a smooth profile ) .",
    "@xcite in order to describe the twisted ethylene at 90  , at least two configurations @xmath9 and @xmath10 have to be included .    following the classification reported in ref . , the methylene molecule , ch@xmath0,@xcite is considered a heterosymmetric diradical , since the two orbitals occupied by the unpaired electrons have different symmetries ( 1b@xmath11 and 3a@xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath7 was extensively studied to assess the reliability of quantitative ab initio calculations for the triplet geometry and the singlet - triplet ( @xmath4 - @xmath5 ) energy gap@xcite .    both the static and the dynamical correlation",
    "play an essential role in the description of the electronic structure of diradicals , from benchmark systems like ethylene , methylene or tetramethyleneethane @xcite to complex transition states or reaction intermediates in biological processes .",
    "on one side , if single - reference methods are inadequate in treating the quasi - degeneracy of singly occupied orbitals in diradicals , on the other side multiconfigurational approaches suffer from some limitations due to the computational cost of the multideterminantal expansion of the wave function .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) is a valid alternative to the traditional quantum chemistry methods for the correct description of diradical molecules .",
    "qmc methods@xcite have been successfully applied to various fields of physics and chemistry , like the study of molecular properties @xcite , materials @xcite , reaction pathways @xcite and biomolecules @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a good scalability with respect to the system size ( @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the number of electrons)@xcite , comparable with that of dft , and by using algorithms that can be efficiently parallelized ( making them extremely suitable for the petascale architectures ) .",
    "these ingredients justify the growing number of applications of qmc in problems of quantum chemistry or molecular physics .",
    "the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method@xcite exploits the combined use of monte carlo integration and variational principle to optimize the many - body , ground - state trial wave function .",
    "further improvements are given by using the fixed node projection monte carlo methods , such as the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc)@xcite and the lattice regularized diffusion monte carlo@xcite ( lrdmc ) .",
    "the wave function ansatz is the ingredient that mostly affects the accuracy of qmc approaches , both in the variational and in the fixed node projection schemes ( although in the latter the effect is alleviated ) .",
    "we propose here the jastrow antisymmetrised geminal power ( jagp)@xcite trial wave function as a promising ansatz to study diradical systems .",
    "the jagp wave function , which implements pauling s resonating valence bond idea@xcite , has been seen to be very efficient in the study of problems of chemical interest , @xcite with accuracy comparable to that of high - level quantum chemistry methods .",
    "its compactness , combined with the use of efficient algorithms for the optimization of all parameters , including linear coefficients and exponents of the atomic basis sets,@xcite leads to a fast convergence of the variational results for electronic and geometrical properties with the size of the basis sets@xcite , with a computational cost comparable to that of a simplest jastrow single determinant ( jsd ) . with a large jastrow factor jagp is size consistent@xcite , without any spin contamination , for partitioning the system in fragments of spin zero and of spin 1/2 .",
    "jagp has already proven to give a good description of the static and dynamic correlation in several cases@xcite , and have inspired new ansatzes such as the linearized jastrow - style fluctuations on spin - projected hartree - fock@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the multiconfigurational nature of jagp is explicitly described , with specific attention to the determination of formal analogies with standard molecular orbital theories for two benchmark systems : the ethylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) and the methylene ( ch@xmath0 ) , representing examples respectively of homosymmetric and heterosymmetric diradicals .",
    "we show how accurate and reliable qmc calculations based on the jagp ansatz are in the estimation of the torsional barrier of c@xmath0h@xmath1 and of the triplet - singlet gap in ch@xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ qmc ] we report the basic concepts of qmc , focusing the attention on the wave function ansatz and providing a detailed description of the jagp wave function , in comparison with other multideterminat approaches and salem and rowland s two - electron model for the description of diradical molecules . the computational details for qmc and casscf calculations reported in this work are given in section [ cdet ] .",
    "the results on the torsional barrier of the orthogonally twisted ethylene and on the singlet - triplet gap of the methylene are reported and discussed in section [ res ] .",
    "final remarks are reported in the conclusions , highlighting how this work constitutes a fundamental step for using qmc in order to have an accurate and computationally feasible description of several chemical processes of biological interest like the thermal isomerization of the retinal chromophore in the mechanism of vision .",
    "the accuracy of qmc approaches , both in the simplest vmc scheme and in the fixed - node projection schemes , are strictly related to the wave function ansatz .",
    "typically , the electronic wave function @xmath15 in qmc @xcite is defined by the product @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the antisymmetric function taking into account the fermionic nature of electrons and @xmath18 is the jastrow factor depending on inter - particle ( electrons and nuclei ) distances ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the collective electronic ( @xmath19 refers to space @xmath21 and spin @xmath22 ) and nuclear coordinates , respectively .",
    "the jastrow factor is a symmetric positive function of the electronic positions ; therefore it does not change the nodal surface ( determined by the antisymmetric term @xmath17 ) , but it describes the dynamical correlation among electrons and satisfies the electron - electron and electron - nucleus cusp conditions @xcite .    in vmc ,",
    "the parameters that define @xmath15 are optimized , within the functional freedom of the ansatz , in order to minimize the electronic energy .",
    "the variational principle ensures that wave function ansatzes which give a lower energy provide a better description of the ground state electronic structure .",
    "some of the limitations of the vmc approach , ultimately ascribable to the wave function ansatz , can be alleviated by adopting the fixed - node ( fn ) projection monte carlo techniques , which provide the lowest possible energy , with the constraint that the wave function @xmath23 has the same nodal surface of an appropriately chosen guiding function @xmath24 ( fixed node approximation)@xcite , that typically is the variationally optimized function @xmath25 . in this work",
    "we have used the lattice regularized diffusion monte carlo@xcite : it turns out to be an efficient scheme even for systems with a large number of electrons@xcite and it preserves the variational principle even when used in combination with nonlocal pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "moreover , the extrapolation for mesh size @xmath26 is generally easier than the extrapolation of time step @xmath27 in ordinary dmc@xcite .",
    "the ansatzes considered in this work are the jastrow correlated antisymmetrized geminal power ( jagp , product @xmath28 of an antisymmetric geminal power and a jastrow factor @xmath29 ) , the jagp with a fixed number @xmath30 of molecular orbitals ( jagpn , product @xmath31 ) and the jastrow correlated single slater determinant ( jsd , product @xmath32 ) .    in paragraph  [ sec : jas ] we review the main features of the jastrow factor , the same in paragraph  [ sec : agp ] is done for the agp and agpn .",
    "we show in paragraph  [ sec : multidetagp ] that the jagp ansatz is intrinsically multiconfigurational , yielding an improvement of the jsd ansatz , mainly in terms of static correlation .",
    "finally , in paragraph  [ sec : jagp_diradicals ] we show that the jagp function includes the expected leading ingredients for a reliable description of the diradicals .",
    "the implementation of the jastrow factor adopted in this paper is described extensively in ref .  .",
    "the jastrow factor @xmath33 used in our calculations consists of several terms accounting for the 2-body , 3-body and 4-body interaction between the electrons and the nuclei .",
    "the exponent @xmath34 of the jastrow factor can therefore be conveniently written as the sum @xmath35 of the electron - nucleus function @xmath36 , the electron - electron function @xmath37 , the electron - electron - nucleus function @xmath38 and the electron - electron - nucleus - nucleus function @xmath39 .",
    "the leading contribution is given by @xmath37 , which yields a homogeneous _ two - electron _ interaction term .",
    "it depends only on the distance between pairs of electrons and it improves the electron - electron correlation , and it is used to satisfy the electron - electron cusp condition .",
    "the _ one - electron _ interaction term @xmath36 improves the electron - nucleus correlation and satisfies the nuclear cusp condition .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 functions describe an inhomogeneous _ two - electron _ interaction , which further correct the correlation introduced by the homogeneous term @xmath37 ( and within the jagp ansatz it reduces the unphysical charge fluctuations included in the agp function@xcite ) .    actually , the electron - electron coalescence problem and the corresponding form of the @xmath37 term need a further explanation .",
    "pairs of like - spin electrons have to satisfy a cusp condition that is different from that of unlike - spin electrons@xcite . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , if two different electron terms are used to satisfy respectively the like - spin and the unlike - spin cusp conditions , this would translate in a spin contaminated wave function .",
    "thus , two approaches are possible : ( _ i _ ) to satisfy only the cusp condition for unlike - spin , because the probability for like - spin electrons to be close is very small , according to the pauli principle ; ( _ ii _ ) to satisfy both the cusp conditions , by using @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively for like and unlike spin electrons . in this paper ,",
    "unless explicitly stated , we have adopted the solution ( _ i _ ) , using the following functional form for the homogeneous two electron interaction term : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the distance between electrons @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the summation runs over all the @xmath14 electrons in the system irrespectively from their spin states , and @xmath46 is a variational parameter . in this case",
    "we will use @xmath29 to indicate the corresponding ansatz .",
    "however , in some cases we have adopted the solution ( _ ii _ ) , by using : @xmath47\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 indicates the spin state of electron @xmath44 , and @xmath49 is the kronecker s delta function . in these cases ,",
    "the ansatz will be indicated with @xmath50 .",
    "the spin contamination induced by this ansatz can be evaluated by calculating the total spin of the molecule @xmath51 , see appendix  [ app : s2 ] .",
    "a spin - unpolarized molecular system of @xmath52 electrons and @xmath53 nuclei describes a singlet state that , within the agp ansatz , is written as : @xmath54 , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the antisymmetrization operator , and the geminal pairing function @xmath56 is a product of a singlet function and a symmetric spatial wave function @xmath57 : @xmath58 the spatial function @xmath57 is a linear combination of products of atomic orbitals @xmath59 : @xmath60 where the indexes @xmath61 and @xmath62 run over all the basis in all the atoms in the system , for a total of @xmath63 atomic orbitals ( note that @xmath63 is determined by the overall basis set size ) . the coefficients @xmath64 have to be optimized in order to minimize the variational energy of the system ( together with the other parameters in the wave function ) .",
    "they define a symmetric ( because @xmath57 is symmetric ) @xmath65 matrix @xmath66 , for a total of @xmath67 variational parameters ( unless the system is characterized by some symmetry property reducing the total number of parameters , see ref .  ) .",
    "the pairing function @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : calg ] ) is written in terms of the ( localized ) atomic orbitals @xmath59 , offering an interesting correspondence between the agp ansatz and the resonating valence bond framework @xcite .",
    "an equivalent way to write the pairing function @xmath57 is obtained by using the molecular orbitals ( mos ) @xmath68 .",
    "the expansion of the pairing function in terms of mos is obtained by performing a generalized ( the atomic orbitals @xmath59 are not necessarily orthonormal , so the overlap matrix @xmath69 ) diagonalization of the @xmath66 matrix appearing in eq .",
    "( [ equ : calg ] ) : @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ gendiag ] ) each column of the matrix @xmath71 represents a generalized eigenvector of @xmath66 and @xmath72 is the overlap matrix .",
    "thus , from @xmath73 , by right multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ gendiag ] ) for the matrix @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 . then , by substituting it in eq .",
    "( [ equ : calg ] ) , we finally obtain that the pairing function is : @xmath76 where the orthonormal single particle functions @xmath77 are the molecular orbitals .",
    "considering this expansion of the pairing function @xmath78 , it may be reasonably expected that the leading terms are provided by the mos associated to the largest ( in absolute value ) eigenvalues @xmath79 .",
    "thus , by considering a truncated pairing function @xmath80 with @xmath81 , the quality of the parametrical wave function is not significantly affected if @xmath30 is large enough , but a substantial reduction of the number of variational parameters is obtained . if this truncated pairing function @xmath82 is used in place of @xmath78 in the agp , we have what in this paper is named the agpn function .",
    "a particular case of agpn is for @xmath83 , that reduces to a single slater determinant function , as it will be proved in the next section .    in order to describe a polarized system , with total spin @xmath84 , a generalized agp ( gagp )",
    "should be used.@xcite the system is constituted by @xmath85 paired electrons , and @xmath86 unpaired electrons with same spin , that without loss of generality can be considered spin - up . thus the system has @xmath87 spin - up electrons , and @xmath88 spin - down electrons , for a total of @xmath89 electrons .",
    "the gagp wave function is written as follows : @xmath90 \\left [         \\prod_{j}^{n_u } { \\chi}_j \\left ( \\textbf{x}_{2 n_p + j } \\right )         \\right ] \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : gagp1}\\ ] ] where single - electron functions @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , have been introduced . the generic function @xmath93 is written as : @xmath94 \\alpha(i ) , \\label{eq : gagp2}\\ ] ] where the @xmath95 coefficients are variational parameters .",
    "each unpaired electron requires the addition of @xmath63 variational parameters , for a total of @xmath96 determinantal parameters for the gagp function of a system with total spin @xmath84 .",
    "the generalization of the agpn case for polarized system is straightforward .    as shown in ref .  , the evaluation of the wave function @xmath97 , respectively in eqs .",
    "[ equ : agp ] or [ eq : gagp1 ] for the unpolarized or polarized cases , reduces to the calculation of a single determinant . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the computational cost for a jagp evaluation is comparable to that of a jsd calculation .      in order to simplify the notation , in the following",
    "we will refer to the unpolarized system ; the generalization to gagp is immediate .",
    "we have already seen that the expansion of the pairing function @xmath57 in terms of mos is convenient because it allows one to include chemically meaningful constraints on the wave function that reduce the number of variational parameters , yielding to the jagpn .",
    "we show here that this expansion also underlines the relation between the agp and the standard ci - like expansion of the wave function in multiconfigurational approaches .    by substitution of eq .",

    "the multideterminant expansion of @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : multiagp ] ) allows us to directly compare the @xmath97 with wave functions from other quantum chemical frameworks . in @xmath97 all the odd excited determinants ( single , triple , etc . )",
    "are excluded , whereas a subset of the even excitations ( those with a multiple excitation to the same virtual orbital ) are taken into account ; only doubly occupied molecular orbitals are present .",
    "in other words , @xmath97 is contained in the seniority zero sector of the electronic full configuration interaction , and its expansion coefficients are determined by the ratios of the eigenvalues of the @xmath108 matrix .",
    "the seniority number @xmath109 represents an alternative tool to classify singlet wave functions .",
    "@xmath109 is defined as the number of unpaired electrons in the slater determinant , e. g. the number of singly occupied molecular orbitals .",
    "@xmath109-based selection of important slater determinants in the ci expansion has been seen to be superior than the traditional one , based on the number of excitations with respect to the reference configuration , when the static correlation plays a major role .",
    "ci wave functions with @xmath110 for benchmark systems are accurate enough to recover the most part of the static correlation , but the fci limit ( including dynamic correlation ) is achieved only when configurations from @xmath111 sectors are explicitly included.@xcite in the case of jagp wave function , the combination between a @xmath110 determinantal term and a jastrow factor allows us to estimate the correlation energy more accurately than @xmath110 ci wave functions .",
    "the set of mos @xmath112 is optimized within the jagp framework , e. g. in presence of the jastrow factor and of the multiconfigurational character of the wave function : mos extracted from our optimization procedure represent therefore the optimal choice for the correlated description of the system under study .",
    "the agpn function can be expanded in a similar way . by substitution of eq .",
    "( [ equ : gn ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ equ : agp ] ) we obtain : @xmath113 that is different from eq .",
    "( [ equ : multiagp ] ) in the fact that the indices @xmath114 run from @xmath85 to @xmath30 ( and not to @xmath63 as for the agp ) . in the particular case of @xmath115 ,",
    "the agpn expansion reduces to the ground state determinant @xmath105 , thus obtaining a closed shell single determinant ( sd ) wave function .",
    "it is worth stressing out here that the determinantal part of this jsd ansatz corresponds to a restricted calculation , since the up and down - electrons are described by the same mos .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the static correlation , the jsd description is comparable with approaches like the restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) or the restricted kohn - sham ( rks ) dft .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ equ : multiagpn ] ) that the jsd ansatz can be improved by including in the pairing function @xmath82 a number @xmath116 of mos .",
    "since typically jsd provides an accurate description of atoms , a natural criterium for the choice of the number @xmath117 of mos is by requiring that , when the atoms are at large distances , we can not obtain an energy below the sum of the jsd atomic energies ( defining the jagpn * wave function , according to @xcite ) .",

    "a well - balanced characterization of the static electronic correlation is of primary importance in order to capture the qualitative features in systems like diradicals and transition states .",
    "multi - configurational quantum chemistry methods are able to provide a reliable description of the electronic correlation in diradical species .",
    "unfortunately the price to pay for these approaches is given by the computational cost rapidly increasing with the system size , thus limiting the application range .",
    "as shown by scuseria and coworkers , @xcite a selection of configurations with small seniority number ( i.e. , the number of unpaired electrons in a determinant ) leads to a fast convergence of the ci expansion in cases where static correlation dominates the electronic structure . through a detailed investigation of the multiconfigurational nature of the agp we have shown how this ansatz is a zero seniority function with some constraints on the coefficients of the expansion and with molecular orbitals optimized at fully correlated level .    in this work",
    "we have investigated two archetypal diradical systems using a jagp ansatz within a qmc approach : the torsion of the ethylene and the @xmath4 - @xmath5 gap of methylene .",
    "the jastrow factor efficiently takes into account the dynamical correlation of the system .",
    "the determinant part of the function , the agp , is responsible for recovering the static correlation .",
    "the results obtained using the jagp ansatz on c@xmath0h@xmath1 and ch@xmath0 demonstrate that even the simplest and computationally cheapest vmc scheme is sufficient to quantitatively describe diradicals states .",
    "indeed the computationally more expensive fixed - node projection scheme ( lrdmc ) produces a rigid shift of the absolute energies , but the energy differences are only slightly affected . on the other hand , the jsd ansatz ,",
    "i.e. a single determinant correlated with a jastrow factor , produces inaccurate results , also using the lrdmc approach .",
    "the reason of such failure is coming from the static correlation that represents the leading ingredient for the electronic structure of diradical species , and a poor description of it dramatically affects the quality of the nodal surface of the wave function . the moderate scaling with respect to the system size ( @xmath162 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the number of electrons ) and the availability of high performance computing facilities allows one to successfully carry out qmc calculations on larger molecules.@xcite this work",
