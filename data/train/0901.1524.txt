    "as other talks in this conference attest , the dark matter ( dm ) paradigm is a dominant one in physical science , on earth and away from it .",
    "so why look for alternatives to it ?",
    "there are three good reasons .",
    "first , although many astronomical observations seem to demand the existence of dm in large quantities , this is always inferred through the standard law of gravity . thus if our understanding of gravity on astronomical scales is flawed , that inference is at grave risk .",
    "second , apart from sporadic reports which often clash with known constraints , dm has not been identified directly , i.e. , by means of a nongravitational experiment .",
    "third , history suggests that it is best to arrive at the accepted picture of a phenomenon by confronting rather different paradigms for it ; confining all attention to the dm paradigm is dangerous until we understand more about the problem it is supposed to solve .    in this review of the mond alternative",
    "to dm , i proceed from some empirical facts about galaxies to the mond paradigm , and thence to modified gravity theories .",
    "disk galaxies rotate ; the stars and gas move together in circular concentric orbits .",
    "the circular velocity is best deduced from the doppler shift of radio waves coming from atomic hydrogen gas , or that of optical lines from the stars . when plotted against radius @xmath1 ,",
    "this velocity constitutes the rotation curve of the galaxy . according to a simple , newtonian",
    ", balance of centrifugal acceleration and gravitation pull of the galaxy , the rotation curve should first rise ( because more mass is being included with increasing radius ) and then decrease as @xmath2 .",
    "but the rotation curves of real galaxies , after first rising , almost invariably flatten out , and this behavior continues well beyond the edge of the optical disk as traced by the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen .",
    "the reticence of rotation curves to fall off as theoretically expected counts as one of the principal reasons for the widespread belief that disk galaxies are all embedded in massive dm halos .    and what sets the velocity in the flat part of the rotation curve ?",
    "a simple rule , the famous and extremely useful tully - fisher law .",
    "in one modern version of it , the infrared ( k - band or 2.2 micrometer ) luminosity of a disk galaxy is proportional to the fourth power of the circular velocity in the flat part  @xcite . in its `` baryonic tully - fisher '' , version the mass in baryons ( stars and in gas ) is proportional to the fourth power of the circular velocity ; specifically @xmath3  @xcite . in brief",
    ", the velocity is tied directly to the _ visible _ matter content .    in the dm halo paradigm",
    "such a law must follow from considerations of galaxy formation , a very messy process by all accounts .",
    "it has been hard to understand the sharpness of the correlation in this view . and the specific form of the power - four law is not well understood either .    in the large clusters of galaxies , agglomerations of hundreds of galaxies moving with random velocities of up to @xmath4 through a medium of very hot gas , newtonian virial theorem estimates of a cluster s mass from the galaxy velocities",
    "are very large compared to the mass seen directly as galaxies and gas .",
    "this mass discrepancy also shows up when the overall cluster mass is determined newtonially from the assumption that the hot gas is in a hydrostatic state , or when gravitational lensing by a cluster is analyzed in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the conventional solution is to assume that the typical cluster contains dm to the tune of about five times the visible mass  @xcite .",
    "we shall set @xmath5 in most equations .",
    "milgrom s mond paradigm  @xcite grew out of dissatisfaction with the dm idea .",
    "milgrom replaces the standard relation between acceleration of a test particle and the ambient newtonian gravitational field , @xmath6 , by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is ascribed to the visible matter alone .",
    "here @xmath9 , a preferred acceleration , is of the order of the centripetal accelerations of stars and gas clouds in the outskirts of disk galaxies .",
    "the @xmath10 is a positive function with @xmath11 when @xmath12 , so that we get back newtonian behavior as appropriate in the solar system where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 when @xmath15 .",
    "this last is the deep mond limit which should be relevant in the outer parts of disk galaxies . if for it we set @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 total galaxy mass ) , we find the mond formula to be satisfied for @xmath19const .",
    "thus in the outskirts of a disc galaxy , where mass no longer grows with radius , mond predicts a flat rotation curve . and",
    "from the coefficients in the above we get that @xmath20 , which is just the baryonic tully - fisher law .",
    "because the mass to infrared luminosity is fairly constant among disk galaxies  @xcite , the infrared luminosity version of the tully - fisher law follows too .",
    "one can view @xmath21 as determined by the observed tully - fisher law .",
    "how well does the mond paradigm reproduce the shapes of observed disc galaxy rotation curves in terms of the mass distribution actually seen in them ( gas and stars )",
    "? fits to over one hundred disk galaxies bear witness that mond is very successful  @xcite . with the choice @xmath22 ( the simple function  @xcite ) and with the mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath23 for the stellar population as its only fitting parameter , mond is as successful as dm halo models with three fitting parameters ( typically @xmath23 , central velocity dispersion of dm particles and scale of length of halo ) .",
    "in addition , the features in a mond predicted rotation curve correlate well with features in the visible mass distribution of the relevant galaxy .",
    "this is embarrasing for the dm paradigm in which the gravitational field that controls the rotation curve comes mostly from the dm .",
    "it is no longer controversial that for disk galaxies of all scales , mond provides the most economical description .",
    "while the mond equation ( [ mond ] ) is incompatible with the conservation laws ( except if applied solely to test particles ) , the mond paradigm can be made dynamically consistent by reformulating it as a modified gravity theory , aqual , derived from an _",
    "_ aqu__adratic _ _",
    "l__agrangian  @xcite .",
    "in aqual the poisson equation is replaced by @xmath24=4\\pi g\\rho , \\label{aqual}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the baryonic matter mass density , and @xmath26 gives the acceleration field . for",
    "spherically symmetric systems the first integral of the aqual equation with @xmath27 reproduces eq .",
    "( [ mond ] ) exactly . for disk like systems",
    "the two differ by some 10 - 15%  @xcite .",
    "thus given the notoriously inaccurate character of astronomical data , aqual fits disk galaxies just as well as does the mond equation .",
    "not only is aqual equipped with the usual set of conservation laws , it also removes the mondian paradox of why stars whose entrails are mostly strongly accelerated ions move in a galaxy in non - newtonian fashion  @xcite .",
    "aqual has established  @xcite the long conjectured external field effect  @xcite : the suppression of mond effects in a system immersed in a sufficiently strong gravity field . and it has permitted full understanding of how mond stabilizes galaxies against the `` cold disk '' instability  @xcite which supplied the original @xmath28 for dm halos . today aqual is the basis for several @xmath29-body simulators which are elucidating the role of mondian effects in galactic formation and evolution  @xcite .",
    "( for more on mond and aqual see recent reviews , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "but aqual is powerless to give a complete account of the dynamics of the large clusters of galaxies . in one of these the accelerations of the galaxies near the center",
    "can well exceed @xmath21 , so both mond formula and aqual would predict nearly newtonian behavior for cluster cores . thus while mond - aqual models of cluster dynamics explain some of the mass discrepancy , they leave a factor of 2 - 3 unexplained  @xcite . unlike galaxies , clusters seem to require invisible mass .",
    "the promising idea  @xcite that the invisible mass is made up of neutrinos ( which _ are _ known to exist ) has been running into problems recently  @xcite .",
    "perhaps clusters contain large amounts of dark baryons  @xcite . or the problem might be solved in mond spirit if a natural way were found to shift upwards milgrom acceleration scale @xmath21 in systems bigger than galaxies .",
    "nonrelativistic by construction , aqual can not serve to describe gravitational lensing by galaxies or clusters of galaxies , or cosmology , both essentially relativistic in nature , and strongly bound up with the dm issue .",
    "in fact , just a few years ago it was common for dm pundits to reject mond because `` it can not be framed relativistically '' .",
    "there were indeed various stumbling blocks on the way to this goal , but they proved surmountable .",
    "today there are an handful of relativistic mond gravity theories which disprove that pessimistic assessment  @xcite .",
    "we turn to the earliest and perhaps simplest of these .",
    "the requisite relativistic theory of gravity must depart from gr  the standard gravity theory today  because the latter has a uniformly newtonian nonrelativistic limit .",
    "but it should not depart from it too strongly because gr is known to be accurate at solar system scale .",
    "gr embodies the equivalence principle ; in its weak form this principle requires that all matter propagate on the same metric .",
    "because of its philosophical basis and strong support from earth - bound experiments , we would like to retain that feature . this means all matter actions in the new theory must be written with one metric , @xmath30 . if we write the gravitational action in hilbert - einstein form using @xmath30 to form the scalar of curvature , @xmath31 , we are back to gr ( unless we are willing to introduce new types of gravitational fields )",
    ". we may choose to depart from gr by modifying the gravitational action , e.g. , as in @xmath32 theories .",
    "but whatever successes maybe claimed by these last in regard to the dark energy puzzle , they can not reproduce the regularities shown by galaxies and summarized by mond .",
    "by contrast , t@xmath0v@xmath0s retains the einstein - hilbert gravitational action , but written with a metric @xmath33 distinct from @xmath30 ; this gives rise a controlled departure from gr .",
    "relating @xmath33 and @xmath30 by a conformal factor is a simple possibility .",
    "this leads to a relativistic version of aqual  @xcite .",
    "however , the scalar field is found to be afflicted by superluminal propagation , and the theory does not provided for the enhanced gravitational lensing that would be required to dispense altogether with dm in galaxies .",
    "a significant idea here is sanders unit timelike 4-vector field @xmath34  @xcite . instead of the conformal relation between the metrics , which is the root of relativistic aqual s failure in the gravitational lensing domain , sanders used @xmath35",
    "( @xmath36 is a dimensionless auxiliary scalar field ) , which _ can _ give lensing of the correct strength .",
    "but since sanders regarded @xmath34 as constant and pointed in the time direction of the cosmos , the resulting theory was not covariant .",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath0s  @xcite achieves covariance by converting @xmath34 into a dynamical field with action @xmath37 } \\mathcal { u}_{[\\beta,\\nu ] }    -2 \\lambda(g^{\\mu\\nu}\\mathcal { u}_\\mu\\mathcal { u}_\\nu + 1)\\big](-g)^{1/2 } d^4 x,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 ia dimensionless parameters and @xmath39 is a lagrange multiplier field charged with maintaining the normalization of @xmath34 to @xmath40 , which is the easiest way to make the vector everywhere timelike .",
    "( of late it has been found useful to buttress @xmath41 with a term @xmath42 to prevent the formation of caustics of the integral lines of @xmath43 and inconsistencies in the weak field approximation to the theory ) .",
    "the action governing this scalar s evolution is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a positive function , @xmath46 is another dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath47 is a constant scale of length .",
    "this differs from a covariant version of the aqual lagrangian  @xcite only in the appearance of @xmath48 instead of @xmath49 , a change introduced to forestall superluminal @xmath36 propagation . in the limit @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath0s reduces to gr  @xcite .",
    "more on t@xmath0v@xmath0s can be found in the reviews  @xcite .    for weak @xmath8 and @xmath36 and a quasistatic situation , t@xmath0v@xmath0s yields the linearized line element ( corresponding to @xmath30 ) @xmath53 the scalar @xmath36 s equation takes on the form of eq .  [ aqual ]",
    "sourced by the same @xmath25 that sources @xmath8 , with @xmath54 playing the role of @xmath55 . with the choice @xmath56 for @xmath57 ( @xmath58 a positive constant ) , and @xmath59 for @xmath60 , the role of @xmath21",
    "is played by @xmath61 whenever @xmath62 , the scalar dominates over @xmath8 in the metric , and we have aqual behavior of dynamics with @xmath63 .",
    "and whenever @xmath64 , @xmath36 has the same form as @xmath8 , so that t@xmath0v@xmath0s reduces to newtonian gravity , albeit with a rescaled gravitational constant . in these senses t@xmath0v@xmath0s is a relativistic mond gravity .    according to eq .",
    "[ met2 ] , in linearized approximation in t@xmath0v@xmath0s , just as in gr , one and the same potential rules dynamics and controls gravitational lensing .",
    "if t@xmath0v@xmath0s describes well the dynamics of a system _ everywhere _ , it should predict the same pattern of gravitational lensing that gr would predict , were the latter supplemented with the appropriate distribution of dm to fit the dynamics everywhere . in practice",
    "this obvious dictum may work less than perfectly when the extant data pertains to just a limited part of the system .",
    "t@xmath0v@xmath0s does well in the confrontation with data for strong lensing ( multiple images ) by galaxies  @xcite .",
    "it meets problems for weak lensing ( distorted single images ) by clusters of galaxies  @xcite ; basically it does not account for the observed distortion without the help of invisible matter apart ( in addition a reasonable dose of neutrinos ) .",
    "this problem is dramatized by a handful of colliding clusters , and has been made much of . but lamenting over t@xmath0v@xmath0s would be premature .",
    "mond has never dealt perfectly with the dynamics of clusters .",
    "so t@xmath0v@xmath0s , which was designed with mond in mind , could not expected to do well in this business , and modifications of it may be in order . and , as already mentioned , clusters may well contain large amounts of _ as yet _ invisible matter  @xcite .",
