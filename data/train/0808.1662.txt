    "synchronized motion , symmetrical group formations ( e.g. , v shaped ) or swirling patterns emerge in spite of the apparently simple behavioral rules of the individual flock members @xcite .",
    "the self propelled particles ( spp ) model was proposed by vicsek _",
    "_ @xcite to describe the onset of ordered motion within a group of self - propelled particles in the presence of perturbations .",
    "taking into the effects of fluctuations inevitably present in biological systems was an essential generalization of the prior deterministic flocking models such as that of reynolds @xcite .",
    "the original model considers point - like particles moving at constant velocity on a two dimensional surface with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the only rule is that , at each time step , every particle approximates , with some uncertainty , the average direction of motion of the particles within its neighborhood of radius @xmath6 .",
    "this model exhibits spontaneous self - organization ; by decreasing the noise parameter , the system undergoes a kinetic phase transition from a disordered state to an ordered one where all the particles move approximately in the same direction . due its simplicity and analogy with biological systems comprised of many , locally interacting particles ,",
    "the spp model soon became a reference model for the flocking behavior of organisms @xcite .",
    "the individual based behavioral rules , determining collective motion , are of particular interest .",
    "important elements of behavioral rules are the nature of the perceived information and the affected behavioral traits .",
    "a frequent assumption in models is that the information , perceived by the particles , is restricted to the velocity of their neighbors .",
    "the interaction range is usually defined by metric distances , but ballerini _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite recently showed that topological distance is the one determining the flocking of starlings .",
    "the assumption of reflecting on the momentary velocity only may not be enough for adequately describing a number of biologically relevant situations .",
    "we expect that the behavior of the spp model is significantly extended if we also incorporate a term corresponding to memory on short time scales",
    ". this can be achieved by introducing an acceleration term into the equations ( rules ) .",
    "this is equivalent to separating time scales by assuming that the particles differentiate between two kind of information , the first being their actual velocity , the second one corresponding to recent change in their direction of motion .",
    "for example , in the case of birds , reacting to acceleration may mean that birds can give signals to their neigbors about their intended changing of their flight direction by quickly modifying their velocity .",
    "in the three - dimensional , scalar noise ( snm ) version @xcite of the original spp model @xcite the particles are assumed to move with a constant velocity @xmath7 , and their positions are updated simultaneously according to @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are position and velocity of particle @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the time increment is set to be @xmath12 .",
    "each particle is assumed to move , with some uncertainty , in the average direction of all the particles within a fixed neighborhood of radius @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the new velocity is given by @xmath14 where @xmath7 is the absolute value of velocity , @xmath15 is a rotational tensor representing a random perturbation , @xmath16 denotes the average velocity of all particles around particle @xmath11 within radius @xmath6 including particle @xmath11 itself , and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath15 performs a rotation of angle @xmath18 around a vector @xmath19 ; @xmath18 is a uniform random value in the interval @xmath20 $ ] , whereas @xmath19 is a random unit vector chosen uniformly from the set of vectors perpendicular to @xmath21 .",
    "the order in which ( [ eq_snm_pos ] ) and ( [ eq_snm_vel ] ) are calculated has some quantitative effects on the results ( see later ) .",
    "here we introduce the acceleration coupled self - propelled particles model ( ac - spp ) being a modified version of snm , in which the velocity vector @xmath22 is a function of both the velocity @xmath23 and the acceleration @xmath24 of the neighboring particles .",
    "then equation [ eq_snm_vel ] becomes    @xmath25    where @xmath26 $ ] is a so - called strategy parameter , expressing the relative influence of the acceleration and velocity tags on the velocity vector of the focal particle .",
    "initially , we have @xmath27 randomly distributed particles , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 stand for box size and particle number density , respectively .",
    "the bounding box has periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the velocity parameter used in the simulations is @xmath30 , corresponding to the low velocity regime @xcite .",
    "taking into account the acceleration in a separate term has various possible motivations . as for the contribution of the @xmath11-th particle",
    ", it corresponds to a memory effect : a given particle , if it has no neighbors , has a tendency to keep on turning as it did in the previous time step .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the average turning rate of the neighbors has now a separated effect on the turning rate of the @xmath11-th particle . in the @xmath0 close to 1",
    "limit the ac - spp model is very much like the original spp , while for @xmath31 the acceleration term dominates and instantaneous turning of the neighbors has a strong effect on the trajectory of the @xmath11-th particle . in this way not only",
    "the state ( velocity ) , but a kind of behavioral pattern ( turning ) can be taken into account .",
    "we associate , for example , with such a behavioral pattern a short turning period of a bird flying in a flock and giving sign for its neighbors of its intended changing of the direction of flight .",
    "we characterize the collective motion of particles by the average velocity of all particles @xmath32 , defined as @xmath33 with @xmath34 denoting the number of particles in the system .",
    "this order parameter can take any value in the range @xmath35 $ ] , and expresses the tendency of particles to move in the same direction .",
    "if the particles move randomly @xmath36 whereas if every particle moves in the same direction @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 was obtained by averaging over @xmath39 individuals runs , each recorded after a relaxation time to stationarity @xmath40 and with time averaging over an additional @xmath41 time steps .",
    "at first we investigated the dynamics of the system at different values of the strategy variable @xmath0 at fixed density and noise values : @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the density was choosen to be high enough to get flocking , but allowing moderate cpu times per run .",
    "the noise value was a typical value resulting in an ordered state for the original spp model ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we found that by increasing @xmath0 the system undergoes a phase transition ; below a critical value , @xmath45 , the ordering , expressed by @xmath32 , is negligible , while above @xmath45 the level of order increases rapidly as a function of @xmath0 ( figure [ avr_vel ] ) .",
    "this is a novel type of phase transition since it corresponds to a phase change _ due to a change in the relative strength of a behavioral pattern_.     as a function of the strategy variable @xmath0 .",
    "the data points were obtained by averaging the results of @xmath39 simulations , using the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath42 , @xmath47 , with a relaxation time of @xmath48 time steps and averaging over an additional @xmath49 time steps .",
    "[ avr_vel ] ]    in order to determine the nature of the phase transition we also calculated the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath32 and the binder cumulant @xmath50 at different strategy values .",
    "the binder cumulant , defined as @xmath51 , measures the fluctuations of the order parameter and can be used to distinguish between first- and second order phase transitions @xcite . in case of a first order phase transition @xmath50 exhibits a characteristic minimum , whereas in case of a second order transition this sharp minimum is absent . in our case ,",
    "the pdf was unimodal , and @xmath50 did not have a sharp minimum around @xmath45 , both indicating a second order phase transition ( figures [ velpdf ] and [ binder ] ) .",
    "@xmath50 was monotonously increasing , as it was observed already in a three dimensional snm with continuous phase transition @xcite .    .",

    "some authors have implemented the model in a slightly different way @xcite , where the order of the position and the velocity update are changed .",
    "huepe and aldana @xcite refer to this as the standard vicsek algorithm ( sva ) and they report that the local density is different in the ova and the sva , while in both cases the average number of interacting neighbors is unreasonably high because of the lack of a repulsive effect . by analysing the ac - spp model with sva - like updating rule ( figure [ sva ] ) , we find that the behavior of the order parameter , the binder cumulant and the average curvature are very similar to those in the ova , but the critical @xmath0 value is lower .",
