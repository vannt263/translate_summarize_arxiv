    "the power of quantum information processing stems from the uniquely quantum phenomena of superposition and entanglement .",
    "quantum bits ( qubits ) are two - level systems with states we can associate with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 of classical bits , but the valuable superposition quality is additional infomation coded in phase information called coherence @xcite@xcite .",
    "coupling of a qubit to it s environment entangles the two sytems , which effects a partial measurement on the qubit and introduces phase errors , a process known as decoherence @xcite@xcite . in nmr terminology , this corresponds to energy - conserving @xmath2-type decay @xcite .",
    "qubits are also subject to non - energy conserving amplitude errors , or @xmath3-type decay .",
    "dynamical decoupling seeks to suppress errors with appropriate perturbations .",
    "application of @xmath4-pulses to a qubit - bath system  dubbed quantum `` bang - bang '' decoupling  effects a sort of time reversal in the system , which creates interference and partial cancellation of environmental effects @xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "has shown that an optimal pulse sequence exists for decoupling a spin-1/2 particle from a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite@xcite .",
    "the improvement of this sequence for preserving coherence has also been verified experimentally @xcite@xcite . for a time interval @xmath5 and an @xmath6-pulse sequence , the uhrig dynamical decoupling ( udd ) sequence suppresses decoherence up to order @xmath7 .",
    "yang then showed that udd suppresses decoherence up to order @xmath7 for a more general qubit - bath hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "indeed , yang shows that the udd is optimal for suppressing @xmath3- or @xmath2-type decay corresponding to either phase or amplitude errors . the ideas of uhrig have been extended to protection of entanglement in two or more qubits @xcite .",
    "the present paper considers the problem of unwanted transitions ( decay and excitation ) between two atomic levels due to a perturbing field .",
    "we examine a scheme which suppresses environmental effects by quasi - instantaneous phase changes on a two - level system @xcite@xcite . by applying a sequence of ultrashort @xmath8 pulses to one state of the two - level system through an auxilliary level ,",
    "this state acquires a phase shift of @xmath4 with respect to the other ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the phase shift leads to destructive interference between evolution terms in the time intervals between the pulses .",
    "note that unlike the traditional spin problems where @xmath4 pulses are applied between the two levels , here we apply @xmath8 pulses between one of the levels and an auxilliary level .",
    "this idea has been implemented in experiments in which fullerene qubits are decoupled from nuclear rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "the question that we investigate in this paper is : what is the optimum sequence of pulses to suppress unwanted transitions ?",
    "we will show that the udd sequence is optimal for a two level transition in an external field in the semi - classical limit .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we prove the optimality of the uhrig sequence using first - order perturbation theory in the case of large detuning . in sec .",
    "iii we look at the exact case using the formalism of transfer matrices . in sec .",
    "iv we prove again the optimality of the udd for zero detuning .",
    "v reinforces these findings with numerical studies which suggest the optimality of the udd across the all ranges of detunings . finally , sec .",
    "vi discusses applications and conclusions . in summary , we find that the udd sequence offers a significant improvement over traditional equidistant pulse sequences for decoupling a two - level system from an unwanted transition .",
    "furthermore , we posit that using the udd in experiments would improve the decoupling by a factor @xmath9 for resonant perturbations and by many orders of magnitude for increasingly detuned perturbations .",
    "for example , in figure 3 we reproduce numerically some data from an experiment by morton , where the equidistant sequence was used @xcite . in addition",
    ", we have generated the data under the influence of the udd sequence to illustrate graphically the improvement offered by such a sequence .",

    "we will see that because of the coupling between the levels , this phase change leads to destructive interference between terms in the time evolution of the transition amplitude .",

    "we now solve the rabi problem exactly in the rotating frame using the formalism of transfer matrices .",
    "of course , since the schrdinger picture and rotating frame are related by a unitary transformation , real observables or expectation values are unchanged .",

    "[ hamiltonian ] .",
    "@xmath59 to eliminate the time dependence of the hamiltonian , we switch to a rotating frame .",
    "@xmath60 under this transformation the schrdinger equation in the rotating frame becomes : @xmath61 by writing our state vector in the two - level basis in the rotating frame , this becomes in matrix form : @xmath62    eqn .",

    "@xmath64 where @xmath65 is the unitary matrix : @xmath66    as a mathematical note , we can now see why the rotating frame was the best choice for solving the problem exactly .",
    "we use the rotating frame because the @xmath67 group property has a desirable form when we transform to a picture in which the hamiltonian is time independent ; namely , for @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "this is desirable because in physical terms this says that the evolution for time @xmath44 followed by evolution for time @xmath72 is the same as evolution for total time @xmath73 .",
    "now we define a matrix which represents the application of an ideal @xmath8-pulse to the ground state through the auxilliary level .",
    "each of the two - levels is an eigenstate of the spin operator @xmath74 , so each state possesses the unique spinor property that a rotation by @xmath8 produces a @xmath4 phase shift @xcite .",
    "hence , a @xmath8-pulse changes the sign of the ground state .",
    "@xmath75 using this formalism , we can easily write down an expression for @xmath76 and @xmath77 after an @xmath6-pulse sequence . @xmath78 in sec .",

[ exact evolution ] in the interaction picture .",
    "@xmath89    we can actually find a simple analytical solution to eqn .",

    "we find that : @xmath98    to see how well the equidistant sequence does in decoupling the levels , we set @xmath99 and use the arithmetic identities : @xmath100 we find that : @xmath101    hence , we can decouple the levels to arbitrary precision given a large number of pulses .",
    "in fact , any number of odd pulses will decouple the two levels completely in the sense that @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this is easy to understand in terms of the physical effects of the @xmath4 phase shift on the ground state .",
    "the pulses effects a sort of time reversal where the system retraces it s steps after the pulse is applied . hence , after an odd number of pulses",
    ", the system ends up exactly where it started .",
    "then why is the uhrig pulse sequence optimum for a general qubit - bath system ?",
    "this is because the time reversal effected on the system affects only the qubit .",
    "hence , the qubit tries to retrace it s steps , but the bath is still constantly reacting to the instantaneous state of the qubit . since most of the time we assume that the initial qubit - bath state is a product state , after any finite time interval the system _ irreversibly _ becomes a mixed state .",
    "therefore , the time reversal is imperfect , and the equidistant sequence is not optimum . then the question arises : what is the optimum sequence for any @xmath6 in our bathless system ?    to answer this question , we seek a function @xmath15 such that : @xmath104    which is simply setting eqn .

    "figure 3 shows rabi oscillations as a function of time , and how they are affected by the pulse sequences . the pulses effect a perfect time reversal on the system for zero detuning , and the udd has a symmetry which always returns the system to where it started .",
    "in contrast , the efficacy of the equidistant sequence depends on the parity of the pulse number .",
    "note that both sequences have some symmetry , which the equidistant sequence loses with non - zero detuning , causing the udd to be more effective for even or odd pulse numbers .",
