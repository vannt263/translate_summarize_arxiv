    "the flavor structure of quarks and leptons is one of the biggest puzzles of particle physics .",
    "the minimal standard model has 19 unexplained parameters , 13 of which are for masses and mixing of the fermions .",
    "a few more parameters ( often associated with new particles ) are needed to account for non - zero neutrino masses and their mixing . some mechanism to explain the fermion mass structure",
    "is keenly desired .",
    "the situation appears worse in supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model .",
    "the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) has additional 105 parameters , many of which are ( susy breaking ) masses and mixing of scalar partners of quarks and leptons , _ i.e. _ sfermions .",
    "arbitrary mixing among the sfermions would cause too large flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) far above the experimental bounds : this problem is referred to as the susy flavor problem .",
    "thus the flavor problem in the susy standard model is two folds : 1 ) the puzzle in the fermion mass structure and 2 ) the puzzle in the sfermion mass structure . how these two are linked with each other",
    "is not clear .",
    "in fact attempts have been made to separate these issues and try to solve the latter independent of the former problem .",
    "this type of approach requires that the susy breaking occurring in a hidden sector is mediated in a special way to our standard model sector .",
    "the susy flavor problem can be solved in this way , though at the same time the resulting sfermion mass structure inherits no information on an underlying theory of flavor which is presumably a physics at very high energy scale .    here",
    "we take an alternative approach to the flavor problem .",
    "namely we shall consider the case where a mechanism which is responsible for the fermion mass structure also dictates the sfermion mass structure @xcite . as was discussed earlier ,",
    "such a strong connection between the two aspects of the flavor problem in supersymmetry is not mandatory .",
    "however this approach seems a natural one in the framework of generic supergravity where one does not impose specific features on the hidden sector and the messenger one .",
    "moreover , if this idea indeed solves the susy flavor problem in nature , the structure of the sfermion masses reflects the mechanism how the fermion masses are generated , and thus one expects that future experiments will bring some hints towards our understanding of the theory of flavor .",
    "explicitly in this paper we consider a democratic type of fermion mass matrices ( with diagonal breaking ) .",
    "the democratic ansatz @xcite is very attractive because it can beautifully explain bi - large mixing in the neutrino sector while small mixing angles in the quark sector are kept .",
    "moreover the underlying symmetry is a permutation group of three objects , @xmath0 , which is one of the simplest groups and may be naturally realized in various settings .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility is that it can have a geometrical origin in brane - world scenario @xcite .",
    "here we assume that this democratic principle can also operate in the sfermion masses .",
    "more precisely the @xmath0 symmetry restricts possible forms of the khler potential , and thus the scalar masses . unlike the minimal supergravity",
    ", the resulting sfermion masses are not degenerate among different generations , but they are almost aligned with the fermion masses .",
    "a small violation of the democracy will induce rather suppressed flavor violation in the sfermion sector .",
    "interestingly the effects to , e.g. @xmath1 may be observed in near future experiments , as we will see later .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly review some basic points of the democratic ansatz for fermion masses . in sec . 3 , we extend this ansatz to the sfermion sector .",
    "we postulate that the khler potential is invariant under the @xmath0 transformations among the generations .",
    "this brings the characteristic mass spectrum for squarks and sleptons as well as their flavor mixing .",
    "the requirement that the neutrino sector has bi - large mixing angles yields very non - trivial constraints on the khler potential . in sec .",
    "4 , lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is discussed .",
    "we show that it is plausible that @xmath1 will be observed in near future experiments in our framework . in sec . 5",
    ", we briefly discuss other flavor violation and cp violation in quark sector .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "in this section we briefly review the democratic ansatz for quarks and leptons @xcite .",
    "we write the yukawa interaction which generates the masses of quarks and charged leptons as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent quarks or leptons of ( left - handed ) su(2)@xmath5 doublets and ( charge conjugated right - handed ) su(2)@xmath5 singlets , respectively , @xmath6 is a higgs doublet and @xmath7 represent yukawa coupling constants . indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for generations and run from 1 to 3 .",
    "here we have used the notion of superpotential as well as chiral superfields for later convenience .    the basic idea of the democratic fermion is to postulate that the yukawa matrix @xmath10 approximately takes a democratic form @xmath11 with some parameter @xmath12 .",
    "it follows immediately that the yukawa matrix is invariant under @xmath13 transformation , where @xmath14 represents a permutation group among the three generations of @xmath3 s , and @xmath15 of @xmath16 s .",
    "we call the basis which gives ( [ eq : democratic - mass ] ) a democratic basis .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to change the basis by a matrix @xmath17 we call this basis a canonical basis . in this basis",
    "the three - dimensional reducible representation @xmath18 of @xmath0 is decomposed into a two - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath19 and a one - dimensional ( trivial ) representation @xmath20 , namely @xmath21 .",
    "the above mass matrix ( [ eq : democratic - mass ] ) becomes proportional to @xmath22 where only the field corresponding to @xmath20 has non - zero mass , which should be identified with the third generation in this democratic limit .",
    "flavor symmetry was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the three generations transform as @xmath23 with @xmath24 being a non - trivial one dimensional representation . the breaking pattern of the @xmath0 symmetry and hence the mass matrix in ref .",
    "@xcite is different from the democratic case we now consider . ]    to be more realistic , we need to include symmetry breaking terms .",
    "let us first discuss the case of quarks .",

    "we have assumed @xmath28 .",
    "an advantage of the breaking terms in the form given above becomes transparent if one moves to the canonical basis .",
    "there the first @xmath29 entries of the matrix are of the fritzsch type @xcite : @xmath30 from which one immediately obtains a phenomenologically favorable relation for the cabibbo angle @xmath31 : @xmath32 the mass matrix ( [ eq : quarks_d ] ) is diagonalized by @xmath33 . the explicit form of @xmath34 is found in the literature @xcite .",
    "here it is sufficient to note that they are approximately @xmath35 and the ratio of the mass eigenvalues is roughly given by @xmath36 a comparison with data determines the magnitudes of the breaking parameters .",
    "for instance , for the down - type quarks , we find @xmath37 a similar expression can be obtained for the up - type quark sector , with much smaller breaking parameters : @xmath38 the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix can be obtained by @xmath39 thus the matrix @xmath40 cancels out , and the remaining one is a matrix with small mixing angles .",
    "it has been argued that the ckm matrix obtained this way gives a phenomenologically successful pattern @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the quark masses and the ckm matrix in the democratic ansatz will be renewed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the lepton sector .",
    "the yukawa matrix of the charged leptons is assumed to be of the same form as those of the quarks @xcite : @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{eq : quarks}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it possesses the flavor symmetry @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for permutation symmetries among the three generations of @xmath45 doublet leptons and singlet leptons , respectively",
    ". the diagonalization can be performed in exactly the same manner as the case of the quarks .",
    "the mass ratio among the three generations implies @xmath46 like in the case of the down - type quarks .",
    "the situation is quite different in the neutrino mass matrix , which is given by the bilinear of the doublet leptons .",
    "thus it has two @xmath43 invariants : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the latter of which denotes the @xmath49 unit matrix . as was discussed by ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter should be taken to obtain bi - large mixing angles which are strongly suggested by the atmospheric and the solar neutrino anomalies @xcite .",
    "this choice may be justified in a brane - world scenario where each generation of the doublet leptons is localized on a different point in extra dimensions @xcite . with diagonal breaking terms , we have the following mass matrix @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{eq : numass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix is approximated to be @xmath51 , and thus @xmath52    to summarize this section , the democratic ansatz with the diagonal breaking works well not only in the quark sector but also in the lepton sector .",
    "in this section we extend this democratic principle to the soft susy breaking terms . to begin with ,",
    "let us recall the susy flavor problem in scenarios where supergravity interaction mediates the susy breaking : arbitrary couplings in the khler potential between the visible sector and the hidden sector immediately cause disastrously large fcnc .",
    "there are several proposals to this problem .",
    "some of the them attribute to separation between the two sectors by postulating special forms of the khler potential . on the other hand , in the minimal supergravity and its variants @xcite a type of u@xmath53 flavor symmetry in the khler metric , with @xmath54 being the number of generations , is implicitly assumed without any justification , while the yukawa sector maximally breaks it . here",
    "we will show that the khler potential controlled by the @xmath0 symmetry solves the susy flavor problem , and at the same time provides some interesting phenomenological consequences on the sfermion masses and mixing , which can be tested by future experiments .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry allows the following khler potential for the mssm fields @xmath55 : @xmath56_{ij } q^\\dag_i q_j ,         \\label{eq : kahler}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are , in general , functions of ( hidden sector ) fields . in the following , we are interested in only their vacuum expectation values which can be expanded in terms of the grassmann variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 notice that @xmath62 and @xmath63 come from the susy breaking .",
    "the existence of the democratic part @xmath64 plays essential roles in our arguments .",

    "the strongest constraint on the complex phases comes from the electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xcite : @xmath184 as is evident in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - sleptons ] ) , @xmath185 has two terms in our scenario : the first term is a universal one , and the second term is flavor - dependent term which originates from the democratic part of the khler potential .",
    "we find that the former contribution dominates , whose magnitude is estimated as @xmath186 to survive the experimental constraint , the phase should be rather small as @xmath187 .",
    "we note that this universal contribution exists in many types of susy breaking scenario , including the minimal supergravity model , and the suppression of the phase of the universal @xmath40-term is a common problem in supersymmetry . although our scenario does not solve this problem , it does not worsen the situation either .",
    "finally , we would like to briefly discuss fcnc constraints in the quark sector in a similar manner as in the previous section . let us consider the @xmath188 and @xmath90 mass differences ( @xmath189 and @xmath190 ) and the branching fraction of the @xmath191 process .",
    "they provide the upper bounds of off - diagonal elements of squark masses , which are listed in table [ tab : fcnc ] . here",
    "we quote the estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite , which considers only gluino exchange diagrams , and all squark and gluino masses are fixed at @xmath192 gev for simplicity .",
    "the limits are scaled as @xmath193 for @xmath189 and @xmath190 and @xmath194 for @xmath191 .",
    "the magnitudes of the off - diagonal elements expected in this model are also listed in table [ tab : fcnc ] . when compared with the experimental bounds ,",
    "we conclude that fcnc processes induced by the @xmath0 symmetry breaking effect reside within the experimental bounds .    as for @xmath191 , there are other dangerous contributions from a chargino - stop loop and a charged higgs loop .",
    "it is known that these two can contribute destructively for a sign of the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath195 , and thus in certain regions of the parameter space the whole susy contribution is in accord with the experimental constraint . we expect that this occurs and will not discuss this point further .",
    "the cp violating quantities @xmath196 of the kaon system put severer constraints on the imaginary parts of the flavor mixing masses .",
    "one finds that the constraint from the @xmath197 bound to the product @xmath198 is much stronger than those to @xmath199 or @xmath200 : @xmath201 on the other hand , the magnitude of this combination is generically expected to be @xmath202 one order of magnitude above the experimental constraint , which may require some fine tuning to suppress the complex phase . here , however , we argue that this constraint is easily overcome if the model is su(5 ) inspired .",
    "in fact , if the model is embedded into su(5 ) , the right - handed down - type squark mass matrix is forced to become an almost unit matrix as well as the left - handed slepton one .",
    "this is simply because the two are in @xmath203 representation in the su(5 ) and the left - handed sleptons are argued to have essentially no flavor violation , which is suggested by the bi - large neutrino mixing angles .",
    "then @xmath204 is zero , and hence the gluino contribution to @xmath197 vanishes .",
    "the upper bounds from the experiments and the expectations in our model for other processes are listed in table [ tab : cp ] for the su(5 ) case . from this table ,",
    "one finds that our scenario marginally survives the bounds from the cp violating quantities .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed the extension of the democratic ansatz to the sector of superpartners of fermions ( sfermions ) in the standard model .",
    "it has been shown that the sfermion masses and their mixing controlled by the democratic ansatz solves the susy flavor problem and provides some phenomenologically interesting consequences .",
    "more concretely we have postulated that the khler potential for the chiral supermultiplets of the quarks and leptons possesses the underlying @xmath0 symmetries of the democratic principle while the superpotential contains their small violation to obtain realistic yukawa interactions for the quarks and leptons .",
    "furthermore we have assumed that the hidden sector which is responsible to the susy breaking couples to the mssm sector only in the khler potential , which is actually a usual assumption in the hidden sector susy breaking scenario .    in this framework",
    ", we have shown that the expectations from the @xmath0 symmetries and their violation are 1 ) the masses of the third generation sfermions can be different from those of the corresponding first two generation sfermions , and 2 ) the small violation of the @xmath0 symmetry induces the flavor violation in the sfermion sector .",
    "remarkably the requirement that the neutrino sector should have bi - large mixing angles constrains the form of the khler metric of the left - handed lepton doublets . unlike the general expectations given above , the requirement implies that the left - handed sleptons should have degenerate masses among the different generations , and also no flavor violation should arise in the left - handed slepton mass matrix .",
    "this observation brings interesting phenomenological implications .",
    "the slepton mass spectrum should be of a special form .",
    "the left - handed sleptons have degenerate masses , while in the right - handed slepton sector the third generation will have a different mass from the first two generations .",
    "these masses are given at some high energy scale and suffer from radiative corrections .",
    "we expect that renormalization group analysis will relate the masses which will be measured experimentally with the masses given here . thus we hope that the mass measurement of the slepton masses which is expected to be done in future collider experiments such as an @xmath205 linear collider will provide a test of the democratic sfermion ansatz .",
    "a special attention has been paid to the lepton flavor violating process @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the branching ratio expected in our scenario survives the current experimental bound , and more interestingly it is generically within the reach of the forthcoming experiment @xcite whose goal is to explore the branching ratio down to @xmath169 , if the sleptons and the charginos / neutralinos have masses around the weak scale .",
    "furthermore , in our scenario , the lepton flavor violating operator of the dipole moment type appears only for the right - handed anti - muon , and thus this property can be tested if the polarized muon beam is available .",
    "on the other hand , the lepton flavor violation of the @xmath206 decay may not be a very promising process to see a signal of our scenario .",
    "we should emphasize that the origin of the lepton flavor violation in the democratic sfermion ansatz is in the non - universality of the sfermion masses allowed by the democratic principle .",
    "this should be compared with the other mechanism to generate the lepton flavor violation that the renormalization group effects from the right - handed neutrino yukawa interactions or the yukawa interaction above the gut scale induces the lepton flavor mixing in the slepton mass matrix which is assumed to be universal at the scale where these masses are originally generated .",
    "this work was supported in part by the grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan , no.12047201 .",
    "kh thanks the japan society for the promotion of science for financial support .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate lepton flavor violating decay rates and the edm of the electron , which arise from dipole moment operators .",
    "we calculate the dipole moment operators using the mass insertion method . here",
    "we discard higgsino - wino mixing diagrams ( @xmath195-term contribution ) and double mass insertion diagrams ( contributions from e.g. , @xmath207 ) , which are proportional to @xmath208 .",
    "thus expressions below are valid in low @xmath173 region .",
    "the resulting dipole moment operators are given by @xmath209 where @xmath210    \\nonumber\\\\    & &    -    \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\alpha}{2 \\pi \\cos^2 \\theta_w }    \\left(\\frac{m_{\\widetilde{b}}}{m_{lj}}\\right )    \\frac{\\left(m_{lr}^2\\right)_{ij}}{m_{\\tilde{l}_l}^2 m_{\\tilde{l}_r}^2 }    \\frac{t(x_l^b ) - t(x_r^b)}{x_l^b - x_r^b }    \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath211 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath212 is the weak - mixing angle , @xmath213 is the fermi constant . @xmath214",
