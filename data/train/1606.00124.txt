    "recent evolution of mobile devices such as smart - phones and tablets has facilitated access to multi - media contents anytime and anywhere but such devices result in an explosive data traffic increase .",
    "the cisco expects by 2019 that these traffic demands will be grown up to 24.3 exabytes per month and the mobile video streaming traffic will occupy almost 72% of the entire data traffic @xcite .",
    "interestingly , numerous popular contents are asynchronously but repeatedly requested by many users and thus substantial amounts of data traffic have been redundantly generated over networks @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , caching or pre - fetching some popular video contents at the network edge such as mobile hand - held devices or small cells ( termed as _ local caching _ ) has been considered as a promising technique to alleviate the network traffic load .",
    "as the cache - enabled edge node plays a similar role as a local proxy server with a small cache memory size , the local wireless caching has the advantages of i ) reducing the burden of the backhaul by avoiding the repeated transmission of the same contents from the core network to end - users and ii ) reducing latency by shortening the communication distance .    in recent years",
    ", there have been growing interests in wireless local caching .",
    "the related research has focused mainly on i ) femto - caching with cache - enabled small cells or access points ( called as caching helpers ) @xcite , ii ) device - to - device ( d2d ) caching with mobile terminals @xcite , and iii ) heterogeneous cache - enabled networks @xcite . for these local caching networks ,",
    "varieties of content placements ( or caching placements ) were developed @xcite and for given fixed content placement , the performance of cache - enabled systems with different transmission or cache utilization techniques was investigated @xcite . specifically , content placement to minimize average downloading delay @xcite or average ber @xcite was proposed for fixed network topology . in a stochastic geometric framework ,",
    "various content placements were also proposed either to minimize the average delay @xcite and average caching failure probability @xcite or to maximize total hit probability @xcite , offloading probability @xcite .",
    "however , these caching solutions were developed in limited environments ; they discarded wireless fading channels and interactions among multiple users , such as interference and loads at caching helpers .    recently",
    ", the content placement on stochastic geometry modeling of caching was studied in @xcite . a tradeoff between content diversity and cooperative gain according to content placement",
    "was discovered well in @xcite but the caching probabilities were determined with numerical searches only .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , cache memory size is restricted to a single content size and loads at caching helpers are not addressed . the optimal geographical caching strategy to maximize the total hit probability",
    "was studied in cellular networks in @xcite . however , only hit probability whether the requested content is available or not among the covering base stations was investigated .",
    "none of the previous works successfully addressed the channel selection diversity and interactions among multiple users such as network interference and loads according to content placement .",
    "success of content delivery in wireless cache network depends mainly on two factors : i ) _ channel selection diversity gain _ and ii ) _ network interference_. for given realization of nodes in a network , these two factors dynamically vary according to what and how the nodes cache at their limited cache memory . specifically , if the more nodes store the same contents , they offer the shorter geometric communication distance as well as the better small - scale fading channel for the specific content request , which can be termed as channel selection diversity gain . on the contrary , if the nodes cache all contents uniformly , they can cope with all content requests but channel selection diversity gain can not help being small .",
    "moreover , according to content placement , the serving node for each content request dynamically changes , so the network interference from other nodes also dynamically varies .",
    "thus , it might be required to properly control the channel selection diversity gain and network interference for each content .",
    "recently , in @xcite , a tradeoff between content diversity and channel diversity was addressed in caching helper networks , where each caching helper is capable of storing only _",
    "one content_. however , although pathloss and small - scale fading are inseparable in accurately modeling wireless channels , the channel diversity was characterized with only small - scale fading and the effects of pathloss and network interference depending on random network geometry were not well captured . in this context , we address the problem of content placement with a more generalized model considering pathloss , network interference according to random network topology based on stochastic geometry , small - scale channel fading , and arbitrary cache memory size . in this generalized framework , we develop an efficient content placement to desirably control cache - based channel selection diversity and network interference .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* we model the stochastic wireless caching helper networks , where randomly located caching helpers store contents independently and probabilistically in their finite cache memory and each user receives the content of interest from the caching helper with the largest instantaneous channel power gain .",
    "our framework generalizes the previous caching helper network models @xcite by simultaneously considering small - scale channel fading , pathloss , network interference , and arbitrary cache memory size . * with stochastic geometry",
    ", we characterize the channel selection diversity gain according to content placement of caching helpers by deriving the cumulative distribution function of the smallest reciprocal of the channel power gain in a noise - limited network .",
    "we derive the optimal caching probabilities for each file in closed form to maximize the average content delivery success probability for given finite cache memory size , and propose an efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution . * in interference - limited networks ,",
    "we derive a lower bound of the average content delivery success probability in closed form .",
    "based on this lower bound with rayleigh fading , we derive near - optimal caching probabilities for each content in closed form to appropriately control the channel selection diversity and the network interference depending on content placement . *",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed content placement is superior to other content placement strategies because the proposed method efficiently balances channel selection diversity and network interference reduction for given content popularity and cache memory size .",
    "we also numerically investigate the effects of the various system parameters , such as the density of caching helpers , nakagami fading parameter , memory size , target bit rate , and user density , on the caching probability .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the system model and performance metric considered in this paper . we analyze the average content delivery success probability and desirable content placement of caching helpers in a noise- and interference - limited network in sections iii and iv , respectively . numerical examples to validate the analytical results and to investigate the effects of the system parameters",
