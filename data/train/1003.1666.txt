    "the system kcuf@xmath0 has long been known as a paradigm for an orbitally ordered system where a cooperative jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion is strongly competing with the electronic degrees of freedom as the driving force behind the orbital order.@xcite this system was investigated recently by realistic band structure calculations as a benchmark system for modeling structural relaxation effects due to electronic correlations  @xcite and for revealing the influence of electronic superexchange on the orbital ordering.@xcite the compound seems to be orbitally ordered throughout its solid phase , but shows long - range a - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering only below @xmath8 = 39 k. in literature an orbital ordering temperature of about 800  k is often evoked in this system , but astonishingly experimental evidence for a transition at this temperature seems to be evasive .",
    "early on , however , it was reported that between 670  k and 720  k an irreversible transition takes place.@xcite recently , the melting of the cooperative jt - transition has been studied in kcu@xmath9mg@xmath10f@xmath0 and from the extrapolation to undoped kcuf@xmath0 a jt transition temperature of 1350  k has been estimated.@xcite the paramagnetic ( pm ) susceptibility has been described by a bonner - fisher law with an exchange constant j = 190 k,@xcite indicating that the compound is a good realization of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin chain in the pm regime .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering studies did reveal a spinon - excitation continuum , a clearly 1d quantum phenomenon , existing also below the nel temperature.@xcite from a structural point of view the reported relatively high tetragonal symmetry  @xcite ( @xmath11  @xmath124@xmath13 ) makes kcuf@xmath0 one of the simplest systems to study .",
    "however , the established symmetry assignment has been questioned by an x - ray diffraction investigation  @xcite which suggested the existence of orthorhombic distortions in kcuf@xmath0 at room temperature with @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "a low - temperature raman scattering study  @xcite revealed a difference of spectra measured in @xmath15 and @xmath16 polarization and anomalously broad linewidths of the stretching modes , which was interpreted as evidence of a symmetry lower than @xmath11 also below the nel temperature .",
    "although orthorhombic distortions were involved for explaining the electron spin resonance ( esr ) properties of kcuf@xmath0,@xcite discrepancies remain for the analysis of recent nqr,@xcite afm resonance,@xcite and further experimental and theoretical findings.@xcite besides , in x - ray resonant scattering@xcite of the orbital ordering ( oo ) in kcuf@xmath0 indications for a coupling of lattice and magnetic degrees of freedom above @xmath8 were found .",
    "only recently , the esr properties for @xmath17 could be successfully explained within the tetragonal symmetry by assuming a dynamical dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction related to strong oscillations of the bridging f@xmath18 ions perpendicular to the crystallographic @xmath19 axis.@xcite it was argued that these dynamic distortions freeze in at a temperature @xmath5 = 50 k , leading to an effectively lower symmetry and the occurrence of exciton - magnon sidebands in optical absorption experiments.@xcite    here we report on a detailed study of the temperature dependence of the raman - active phonons in a kcuf@xmath0 single crystal tracking the symmetry reduction during the anticipated freezing of the dynamic distortion at @xmath5 = 50 k and the nel ordering at @xmath8 = 39 k. we find a large softening of the lowest lying @xmath1 mode and the @xmath2 mode by 25% and 13% between room temperature and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the linewidth and the integrated intensity of these modes also exhibit anomalies at @xmath5 and @xmath20 moreover , the @xmath1 mode at about 260  @xmath6 clearly splits below @xmath5 evidencing the existence of an antiferrodistortive lattice instability in kcuf@xmath0 which leads to a symmetry reduction at @xmath5 = 50 k prior to magnetic ordering .",
    "the single crystal was oriented by laue diffraction , cut along the ( 110 ) pseudocubic plane and mechanically polished to optical quality",
    ". details on crystal growth are described in ref .  .",
    "the sample has previously been investigated by esr and optical spectroscopy.@xcite the raman spectra were obtained with two different experimental setups and in two geometries of experiment : ( i ) a dilor xy triple spectrometer with a liquid - nitrogen - cooled ccd detector ( quasi - backscattering geometry ) and ( ii ) a u1000 high resolution double spectrometer with rca 31034a photomultiplier ( right - angle scattering geometry ) .",
    "the 647 nm ar / kr ion ( 5 mw output power ) and the 632.8 nm he - ne ( 25 mw output power ) lasers were used for excitation in these two setups , respectively .",
    "temperature dependencies were obtained in variable temperature gas - flow cryostats .",
