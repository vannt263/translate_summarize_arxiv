    "we use a 2d square lattice model with nearest neighbor hopping @xmath11 , doping @xmath12 , and rashba soc @xmath13 to model a generic 2d soc semiconductor : @xmath14 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath15 is the fermion annihilation operator on site @xmath16 with spin @xmath17 . in order to break the spin - degeneracy and produce majorana fermions",
    "we add a zeeman field to the whole sns structure : @xmath18 .",
    "experimentally @xmath19 can be provided by proximity to a ferromagnetic insulator . finally , in the s regions of the structure we model the proximity induced superconducting state by @xmath20 .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is @xmath21 in the s regions and zero otherwise .",
    "we also assume smooth interfaces and fourier transform with momentum @xmath22 in the direction parallel to the sn interfaces .",
    "our model is equivalent to that of sato _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and we quickly restate the four different tps possible for @xmath23 : ( i ) : @xmath24 , ( ii ) : @xmath25 , ( iii ) : @xmath26 , and ( iv ) : @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to know here that phase ( i ) is a trivial tp with two ( non - superconducting ) fss centered around @xmath28 , ( ii ) is a non - trivial tp with one fs centered around @xmath29 , ( iii ) is also a non - trivial tp but with its fs centered around @xmath30 , whereas ( iv ) is a trivial band insulator .",
    "thus , majorana modes exist at s - vacuum edges at @xmath31 in phase ( ii ) and at @xmath32 in phase ( iii ) @xcite .",
    "note that due to the superconducting proximity effect at sn interfaces , @xmath33 in the above pb equations needs to be the _ effective _ order parameter and should thus be @xmath34 for the s regions and @xmath35 for the n region .",
    "we first consider an analytical description of the above model in phase ( ii ) at very low carrier concentrations , i.e.  an effective model of a lightly doped semiconductor with one fs centered around @xmath29 in both s and n. in this regime we can approximate the band structure as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the lattice constant , but for brevity we will here drop the prime @xmath41 .",
    "this directly connects to previous continuum model work on soc semiconductors @xcite and will also allow us to analytically extract the abs spectrum .",
    "the @xmath4-wave spin - singlet order parameter @xmath34 has the component @xmath42 in this band after a pseudospin - transformation .",
    "effectively , we are thus left with a hamiltonian which maps perfectly onto a spinless @xmath5 superconductor . to model a realistic scenario , we allow for both different chemical potentials and masses of the quasiparticles in the s and n parts of the junction , denoted @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . in this way ,",
    "an effective resistance is present upon transmission between the s and n regions due to the fermi - vector mismatch . in order to compute the abs energies , we set up the wavefunctions in each of the three regions in the junction and match them appropriately at the interfaces , using a framework similar to ref .",
    "lengthy calculations provide the allowed abs energies @xmath45 where @xmath46/(\\alpha^2k_f^2+v_z^2)[2k_x^4 + 2q_x^4 + 12q_x^2k_x^2 \\notag\\\\ & - 2(k_x^2-q_x^2)\\mathcal{c}]\\big)^{1/2 } \\text { with } \\mathcal{c } = \\cos2q_xl.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above , @xmath47 where @xmath48^{1/2}$ ] while @xmath49 with @xmath50^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath51 is the transverse momentum index which is quantized for a finite width @xmath52 of the junction , whereas the phase factor @xmath53 , defined via @xmath54 , is related to the @xmath55-space structure of the superconducting gap .",
    "the above bound - state expression can then be used to calculate the josephson current in the short - junction regime @xmath56 : @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 the inverse temperature . as a consistency check for the above result",
    ", we briefly consider the limit of equal masses and chemical potentials in the system , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in this case , eq .  ( [ eq : abs ] ) is seen to reduce to the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a transmission constant independent on @xmath9 .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , where 1d tunneling between pure @xmath64-wave superconductors was considered .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyabs ] we display the energy spectrum of the abss in the junction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyabs](a ) we show energy versus @xmath1 for multiple transverse modes @xmath22 .",
    "the most striking feature is the appearance of a zero - energy crossing precisely at @xmath65 for @xmath31 . for finite values of @xmath22 ,",
    "the abs - levels repel each other just as in ordinary @xmath4-wave superconductors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyabs](b ) , we consider energy versus @xmath22 .",
    "the abs - levels oscillate strongly with momentum , similarly to the numerical lattice - results discussed below .",
    "again , we see the zero - energy crossing at @xmath66 when @xmath0 .",
    "we find both here and in the numerical results that the two states associated with the zero - energy crossing , the two abs majorana fermions , are fully delocalized in the n region .",
    "however , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the absence of processes that violate the conservation of fermion parity locally ensures that there is no transition between these two states , thus keeping their majorana nature intact .",
    "the question is now , is it possible to experimentally identify the above mentioned abs majorana modes ?",
    "here we demonstrate a route for doing so via standard transport measurements .",
    "consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : abs ] ) and the normally incident mode @xmath67 for which we obtain : @xmath68 .",
    "note that the effective transmission coefficient is now dependent on the length @xmath9 of the junction .",
    "the @xmath10-periodicity is given by the zero - energy levels crossing at @xmath0 instead of repelling each other .",
    "since the josephson current may be written as @xmath69 $ ] , it is clear that as long as the first term has an appreciable magnitude compared the higher @xmath70 modes ( which is expected since the transmission probability peaks at normal incidence ) , its periodicity should be reflected in the current - phase relation of the total josephson current .",
    "it is important to note that the observation of this 4@xmath71-periodicity , or equivalently a fractional josephson effect , is not possible for a dc bias under equilibrium conditions .",
    "the reason for this is that then the population of the positive and negative energy branches of the abss in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyabs ] would always be zero and filled , respectively .",
    "the negative of these energy branches is 2@xmath71-periodic , and thus the effect would be lost . on the other hand , by applying a bias voltage to the junction with a josephson period of @xmath72 , one can ensure to populate a single branch when adiabatically varying @xmath73 as long as @xmath72 is smaller than the relaxation time associated with e.g.  a bound - state emitting a photon and then relaxing into the negative branch . by keeping only one single branch populated for all phases in this way",
    ", one would observe precisely the announced 4@xmath71-periodicity , which has previously been discussed for 1d @xmath5 systems @xcite .",
    "the experimental technique for non - equilibrium population of a single branch in a controllable fashion has been clearly demonstrated in the context of josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "having established the appearance of majorana fermions at @xmath65 when s and n belong to the same non - trivial tp , we return to the lattice model and its more general phase diagram . here",
    "we will show that a majorana fermion can also be located at the sn interface for any @xmath1 if , in addition to s being in a non - trivial tp , n is in _ another _ phase .",
    "the position of this pb majorana fermion will be at the pb between the s and the n region and is thus a manifestation of the termination of the non - trivial tp in s , akin to a s - vacuum edge .",
    "therefore the inverse proximity effect , i.e.  the reduction of @xmath33 on the s side of the interface captured in a self - consistent treatment , can move the majorana fermion well into the s region .",
    "below we only report standard non - self - consistent results , but we have confirmed our results even when including self - consistency . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] we plot the eigenvalue spectrum at @xmath74 for different junction lengths [ the superconducting coherence length is defined as @xmath75 , for s in phase ( ii ) and n in phases ( i)-(iii ) , counted from the top .",
    "the case treated analytically above , with s and n in ( ii ) , corresponds to figs .",
    "[ fig : bands](c ) and [ fig : bands](d ) but here @xmath76 , so no abs majorana fermions are present .",
    "we see that the abs spectrum is somewhat more spread out in @xmath22 in the numerical solution , due to the anharmonicity of the band structure , and that more and lower lying abs levels appear for longer junctions . however , we reproduce all significant results from the analytical treatment .",
    "most notably , the zero - energy abs majorana fermions appear only at @xmath0 and @xmath77 . if instead s and n are both in phase ( iii ) , the results are analogous with the exception of the majorana fermions now appearing at @xmath32 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the abs spectrum being centered around the same @xmath22 value as the fs in n. moving on to figs .",
    "[ fig : bands](e ) and [ fig : bands](f ) , where n is in phase ( iii ) , the abs spectrum is centered around @xmath32 and it is again rather spread out in @xmath55-space . here",
    "we also have a proper pb between the s and the n regions with the majorana modes associated with phase ( ii ) in s located at @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the abs spectrum and the pb majorana modes are well separated in @xmath55-space , as clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : bands](e ) and [ fig : bands](f ) , and the pb majorana mode is present . finally in figs .",
    "[ fig : bands](a ) and [ fig : bands](b ) , n is in phase ( i ) and there is again a pb between s and n. however , both the abs spectrum and the pb majorana modes are now centered at the same @xmath77 point , and we see a large hybridization between these two features , resulting in the destruction of the zero - energy pb majorana fermions . note that this hybridization is not only strong at large @xmath9 , where the abs spectrum appears at low ( but finite ) energies , but exist even in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands](a ) , where the abss are located at energies @xmath78 for small @xmath22-values . in the very short junction limit , where the abs spectrum joins the bulk continuum ,",
    "we start seeing small remanent traces of the pb majorana modes at the sn interfaces , although in our lattice model @xmath9 is now so short that the majorana modes themselves start to significantly overlap , causing a finite gap .",
    "it is thus hard to determine which effect is largest in terms of gapping out and destroying the two distinct interface majorana modes in the @xmath8 case .",
    "not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] is n in phase ( iv ) . here",
    "n is a band insulator which can not support abs levels inside the insulating gap , and we thus find pb majorana modes at @xmath77 for s in phase ( ii ) .",
    "lastly , analogously to the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] , for s in phase ( iii ) we find pb majorana modes at @xmath32 for n in phases ( i),(ii ) , and ( iv ) , as then there is a pb between s and n and the abs spectrum does not interfere .",
    "we thus conclude that pb majorana modes exist only when s is in a non - trivial tp , there is a pb between s and n and , most importantly , only when the fss of s and n are _ not _ centered at the same @xmath55-point .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos ] we explore the spatial distribution of the pb majorana modes in the prototype case of s in phase ( ii ) and n in phase ( iii ) [ cf .",
    "[ fig : bands](e ) ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](a ) the ldos as a function of both energy and distance from the middle of the junction is plotted .",
    "the bulk gap appears at @xmath79 in s , whereas the abs spectrum in n reaches down in energy to at @xmath80 for @xmath74 .",
    "the light gray band at even low energies on either side of the interfaces are the pb majorana modes , the constant dos being a feature of the dirac spectrum in 1d . to complement this data we plot in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](b ) @xmath81 , the low - energy carrier density , as a function of distance , which shows the well resolved pb majorana fermions at the two sn interfaces .",
    "thus the pb majorana modes constitute two counter - propagating chiral majorana modes well localized to the two sn interfaces .",
    "finally in the main panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](b ) we explore the dependence on the superconducting phase difference @xmath1 across the junction , by plotting @xmath81 at the peak position of the majorana fermion ( black crosses ) and in the middle of the junction where the abs spectrum is present ( red circles ) . here",
    "we see that the majorana fermion persists for all @xmath1 .",
    "the slight increase in @xmath81 at the majorana position at very large @xmath1 is due to the abs spectrum finally closing at @xmath0 , as seen clearly in the red curve with circles .",
    "note , however , that while the pb majorana modes are only well resolved in energy for @xmath82 in @xmath55-integrated data , they are still well resolved in @xmath55-space for all @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to the abs majorana mode which , first of all , only exists at zero energy for @xmath0 , and even then , they are not separated in energy from other low - lying parts of the abs spectrum .",
    "the localization to the sn interfaces , and the existence at all @xmath1 , which allows for energy separation from the abs spectrum , means that the pb majorana modes can be easily detected by a ldos probe such as scanning tunneling microscopy . to allow for a broad window of detection",
    ", short junctions are preferred as then the abs spectrum appears at higher energies .",
