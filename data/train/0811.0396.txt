    "the required center - of - mass energy for both pair ( @xmath9 @xcite ) and pion production ( @xmath10 @xcite ) is found through collisions of the uhecr with both 2.7  k cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , whose energy density peaks with photons of energy @xmath010@xmath11  ev , and to a lesser extent with the infra - red background , whose energy density peaks with photons of energy @xmath010@xmath2  ev . provided the propagation time from their sources to earth is greater than their energy loss time , the protons invariably undergo these energy loss interactions , generating a secondary flux of ultra high energy ( uhe ) electrons , photons , and neutrinos en - route , sharing out their energy flux among these various `` stable '' particle types via these particle production processes . in the left - panel of fig .",

    "[ analytic ] .",
    "the discrepancy between the analytic and monte carlo description , seen in the plot , for protons from the most distant shell ( 81 - 243  mpc ) being due to the neglection of pair losses whose role becomes more important when @xmath32100  mpc propagation distances are probed .",
    "this can be understood from the `` @xmath51 creation '' curve in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ energyloss_times ] which demonstrates that loss lengths of a few 1000  mpc , through proton pair losses in the cmb , are expected .",

    "the different @xmath52 in eqn  ( [ distribution ] ) ) , the spectral index is found to play a very minor role in the spectral slope of the gzk feature .",
    "hence , the effect of a steeper spectral index on the arriving proton spectra is simply to steepen the arriving flux at energies below the gzk feature .",
    "thus , with a smaller energy flux of protons injected into the uhe - photon population in the gzk energy range , a reduced energy flux is injected into the uhe - photon population at the energies around the beginning of the cut - off ( 10@xmath19  ev ) , with the injected energy flux reduced further still at even higher photon energies .",
    "a calculation of the arriving photon spectrum produced via neutral photo - pion production interactions of the uhecr protons is a little more involved , requiring the consideration of their production as well as their attenuation through subsequent pair production interactions .",
    "in analogy with the production of secondary protons for photo - nuclear disintegration given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectrum of neutral pions produced through photo - pion production after having propagated distance @xmath53 from the source is given by , @xmath54 hence , the spatial distribution of neutral pions produced through the propagation of an ensemble of given energy protons , over the entire range in @xmath35 of source distances under consideration , is obtained .",
    "a comparison of the arriving photon flux ( following the rapid decay of the neutral pions to photons ) from the monte carlo and analytic descriptions is shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",

    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown ] , the propagation of the energy in secondaries soley in the form of photons through the system was implicitly assumed , with the energy of the pair creation electrons disappearing from the system through the synchrotron channel . however , with the present degree of uncertainty in the strengths of the cosmic radio background and extra - galactic magnetic fields , the favoured route that this energy takes also remains uncertain .",
    "following the photon fluxes obtained in the previous section , we here demonstrate the variation introduced by either a weaker radio background or weaker extra - galactic magnetic field strength .",
    "we consider the extreme cases of : a low radio background ( dominated by the low energy cmb ) and single pair production after which the energy disappears from the system through the synchrotron channel ( considering throughout only photon energies above 10@xmath55  ev ) ; a large radio background @xcite and single pair production with electrons cooling via the synchrotron channel ; a large radio background and full @xmath23 cascading .",
    "for the second of these , the electron inverse compton interaction lengths and both electron inverse compton and photon pair production inelasticities were calculated @xcite and a monte carlo description of the cascade was used .",
    "we refer to this radio background measurement result as large due to possible local foreground contamination from synchrotron emission in the milky way s halo . following radio background measurements ,",
    "nearly 40 years ago , attempts have been made to model total radio background emitted by sources @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of a weaker radio background , we consider the extreme case for which the low energy ( radio ) cmb component is the dominant contribution .",
    "though this scenario is certainly extreme , we use it here simply to demonstrate the effects from a range of parameter space .",
    "we refer to this scenario as `` _ cmb only , single _ '' , presenting the results in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown2 ] . as in the previous section for which the `` _ clark radio , single _ '' scenario was used ,",
    "a dip feature is seen in the arriving photon flux from the more distance shells ( @xmath3227  mpc ) .",
    "the origin of the feature is the same as that described previously ( see the beginning of section [ source_shells ] ) . for the case of a weaker extra - galactic magnetic field",
    ", we consider the case of sufficiently weak magnetic fields such that the @xmath23 cascade s development is unhindered . in this scenario ,",
    "synchrotron cooling times of uhe electrons are slower than the inverse compton cooling times on the background radiation fields .",
    "with synchrotron cooling times going as , @xmath56 , magnetic fields of @xmath5710@xmath58  g are sufficiently weak that these synchrotron cooling times become much larger than the 0.3  mpc ( @xmath01  myr ) interactions lengths ( for which the inelasticity per interaction is near unity ) .",
    "once again , we consider such extreme scenarios in order to capture the effect from a range of parameter space . we refer to this scenario as `` _ clark radio , cascade _ '' , presenting the results in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown2 ] .",
    "furthermore , for this scenario , the development of the @xmath23 cascades leads to the filling in , and partial erasing , of the dip feature seen previously in the non - cascading result shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown ] in section  [ source_shells ] .",
    "since the quantity usually obtained from searches for uhe photons in uhecr data is the photon fraction @xcite , we present the photon fraction calculated for the `` _ clark radio , single _ '' scenario in fig .",

    "we also present a breakdown of the contributing photon fluxes to the photon fraction from the different shells . from this breakdown",
    "it can be seen that the arriving photon fraction is predominantly contributed from sources in relatively local shells , with distances tens of mpc away .",
    "the dip feature seen in the photon fraction in fig .",
    "[ photon_fractions ] originates from a convolution of the gzk feature in the proton flux itself along with the dip feature present in the arriving photon flux explained previously in section [ ensemble_results_breakdown ] . for the homogeneous source distribution case , photon fractions between 10@xmath11 and 10@xmath2",
    "can be seen to be expected , with the photon fraction peaking at 10@xmath2 close to the maximum energy the cosmic rays are injected up to before the cutoff kicks in at energy @xmath27 .",
    "these results are found to be in approximate agreement with previous calculations of the photon fraction @xcite .",
    "however , this photon fraction result has been calculated for a single maximum energy , @xmath27 , of the protons produced by the uhecr sources . in the following section we address the influence other values of @xmath27 have on these results .      in order to disentangle the effect on the photon fraction caused by the maximum energy of the proton , @xmath27 , from the local spatial distribution of uhecr sources to be discussed in this paper , we here",
    "explicitly obtain the photon fraction for the different @xmath27 values of 10@xmath7  ev and 10@xmath59  ev . the alterations to both the gzk feature and the photon fraction are shown in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ photon_fraction_cut - off ] . for comparison",
    "we also show the results obtained in the previous sections , with @xmath27=10@xmath48  ev , in the solid line curves .",
    "for all these calculations a homogeneous distribution of sources was assumed . in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ photon_fraction_cut - off ] , the effect of the cut - off energy on the arriving uhecr spectrum is shown .",
    "an understanding of this effect comes from a consideration of the breakdown of this flux from the different source shells shown in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown ] , with the cut - off energy primarily effecting the contributions from the more local shells which dominate the uhecr flux at the cut - off energy . in the right - panel of fig .",
    "[ photon_fraction_cut - off ] , the effect of the cut - off energy on the photon fraction of the uhecr flux is shown .",
    "interestingly , the photon fraction at all energies is seen to increase when the cut - off energy is increased .",
    "a qualitative understanding of this follows from the fact that ( for a given injection spectrum ) as the cut - off energy is increased , the uhecr energy injected into particles above threshold for @xmath8 interactions is increased , leading to an increased injection of uhe photons .",
    "however , a more complete understanding as to why the photon fraction increases significantly around the cut - off energy , when the cut - off energy is increased , can be obtained through a consideration of the photon and proton fluxes at the cut - off energy . as the cut - off energy",
    "is increased from 10@xmath7  ev to 10@xmath59  ev , the proton flux at this energy decreases by nearly an order of magnitude ( see the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ photon_fraction_cut - off ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the photon flux at the cut - off energy increases by more than an order of magnitude , resulting in more than a two order of magnitude increase in the photon fraction at the cut - off energy .",
    "this large increase in the photon flux at the cut - off energy has two components .",
    "the first of these may be understood by considering the photon flux produced by protons injected in the 3 - 9  mpc and 9 - 27  mpc shells , the dominant contributing shells to the arriving photon flux at the cut - off energy . for a cut - off of 10@xmath7  ev",
    ", the majority of the photon flux at the cut - off energy arrives from sources out to @xmath010  mpc ( ie .",
    "only the first mpc or so of the 9 - 27  mpc shell actually contributes ) , after which attenuation of the flux through pair production interactions kills contributions from sources further away .",
    "however , as the cut - off energy is increased to 10@xmath59  ev , the contributing region to the photon flux at cut - off increases to roughly half the 9 - 27  mpc shell ( the inner 10  mpc of the shell ) , due to the increase of the pair creation interaction length with energy ( see the right - panel of fig .",
    "[ energyloss_times ] ) .",
    "such a contributing region argument leads to a factor of 2 increase in the photon flux . the second , by far the dominant effect causing the large increase in the photon energy flux at the cut - off energy , is the fact that the number flux from a given source at the cut - off energy is the same for the different @xmath27 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the photon flux at the cut - off energy arrives predominantly from the first pions produced by protons after being emitted from the source ( ie .",
    "whose distribution follows from @xmath60 in eqn  ( [ pion_contribution ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the energy flux at the cut - off energy , for an order a magnitude in @xmath27 , increases by an order of magnitude .",
    "the overall effect on the photon fraction is a general increase as the cut - off energy is increased , with the most significant increase occurring for the second peak of the photon fraction curve , which peaks at approximately the cut - off energy , @xmath27 .      in the previous section we focussed on the expected results obtained from a homogeneous distribution of sources . in this section",
    "we depart from the homogeneous assumption to investigate how the photon fraction is affected by a local source distribution . in order to account for the natural fluctuations that must exist at some level within the homogeneous distribution locally due to the fact that sources are not distributed continuously in space but are finite in number , occupying particular positions",
    ", we here investigate the effect that local source over - densities / under - densities can have on the arriving photon fraction .    in terms of over - densities ,",
    "for the extreme case in which one of the shell regions dominates completely the arriving uhecr and photon flux above 10@xmath1  ev , the proton and photon fluxes arriving to earth would be those from the corresponding shell in fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown ] . from these results ,",
    "a large photon fraction is found to be achievable for fluxes soley from either local or distant shells , though the energy at which this occurs is very different in the two cases .",
    "this will be addressed in section  [ single_source ] . however , typically the expected contribution from each shell should scale approximately with the width of the shell , with contribution ratios of roughly 1.0  :  0.3  :  0.09  :  0.03  :  0.01 being expected .",
    "if a local over - density of sources within the surrounding shells considered did exist , the arriving photon fraction and gzk feature would both differ significantly from the homogeneous source distribution scenario . describing the ratio of the contributing shells as @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 referring to further away shells ) , having a ratio of 1:0.3 for the homogeneous source scenario ,",
    "we alter this ratio in order to simulate the effects of a local over - density , with nearby sources gaining a weighting factor when summing up the shell contributions . in fig .",
    "[ photon_fractions_enhancement ] , both the effects this has on altering gzk feature ( in the left - panel ) and the alterations to photon fraction ( in the right - panel ) are shown . the gzk feature for this scenario",
    "is found to be somewhat delayed to higher energies , with a milder cut - off spectral slope , following the increase in dominance of the local contributing shell spectra , whose contributions can be seen in the left - panel of fig .  [ ensemble_results_breakdown ] .",
    "the photon fraction , however , alters only significantly at the lower energy peak , which increases in height with the introduction of the local uhecr source density enhancement , by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "such an increase in the photon fraction at lower energies approximately scales with the enhancement ratio of the source distribution locally , as might be expected .",
    "following on in the vein that a departure from homogeneity might exist in the uhecr source distribution , we also attempt to account for the effect of a local depression in the source distribution by introducing a hole of uhecr sources surrounding earth .",
    "the effects introduced to the gzk feature by a local depression of uhecr sources are shown in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ photon_fractions_void ] , with the effects on the photon fraction being shown in the right - panel of fig .",
    "[ photon_fractions_void ] .",
    "such a depression , in fact , is found to enhance the photon fraction of uhecr , with an increase in the hole size of the sources surrounding earth , leading to more than an order of magnitude increase in the high energy end ( @xmath3210@xmath48  ev ) of the uhe photon fraction plot .",
    "however , it should be noted that such a growth in the photon fraction only exists in the region in which the energy flux of arriving uhe particles is less than 4 orders of magnitude below that at 10@xmath1  ev , so can not be expected to be detectable by present uhecr detectors . in this local depression of sources scenario , the gzk feature , contrary to the over - density of sources case , leads to a harder spectral cut - off feature .",
    "this is due to the dominance of the further away contributing shells , whose spectra are shown in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown ] .      following on from these perturbations to the source distribution from the homogeneous scenario ,",
    "we here focus on the photon fraction of the propagating particles from a single uhecr source ( assuming rectilinear propagation for protons ) .",
    "this provides an understanding of the photon fraction expected in the extreme scenario of a single dominant local uhecr source .",
    "though this scenario would seem to require uncomfortably slow diffusion in order to prevent violation of anisotropy limits , it nevertheless can provide a useful insight to understand the results obtained from an ensemble of sources located at a particular radius .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ photon_fraction_dist ] the evolution of the photon fraction as a function of distance from the uhecr source , for different energy particles .",
    "the lines in the plot that terminate early ( ie .",
    "those for 10@xmath48  ev and 10@xmath59  ev particles ) indicate that the energy flux from the source has decreased more than 4 orders of magnitude at the termination distance .",
    "hence , though such a flux may contain a large photon component , it would be unobservable to present generation uhecr detectors .",
    "this photon fraction should be considered as a lower bound value , since the presence of magnetic fields will extend the actual propagated path of the protons relative to that of the same energy photons ( which themselves have a slight path increase from the source due to their , much higher in energy , parent proton s deflected trajectory ) .    as a general rule , the photon fraction curves in fig .",
    "[ photon_fraction_dist ] for particles above the injection cut - off , @xmath27 , are different in shape than those below this energy . for particles below @xmath27 , the photon fraction curve peaks at more local distances with increasing energy particle .",
    "furthermore , at energies below the peak value , the photon fraction is larger for higher energy particles .",
    "this follows simply from a consideration of both the arriving proton and photon fluxes arriving from the different radii shells shown in fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown ] . for particles above @xmath27 ,",
    "the photon fraction in fact curves upwards ( has a positive second derivative ) with increasing distance . such an increase in the photon fraction follows from a consideration of our analytic description to both the proton and photon fluxes . above the energy , @xmath27 , at which the injected protons are suppressed , the contribution to the proton fluxes , at a given energy , from the pion losses of higher energy protons , are penalised . since the photon fluxes of the same energy originate from much higher energy protons , the suppression to the contribution of the photon flux from multi - pion loss protons is also strong .",
    "hence , at energies above the cut - off , the protons that arrive have predominantly undergone no pion production processes and the photon flux arrives predominantly from protons that have only undergone a single pion loss . from this",
    ", it follows that the increase in growth of the photon fraction with distance for energies above @xmath27 is the result of the decrease in the ability of the protons that have undergone no photo - pion interactions to arrive at earth and a lack of attenuation of the photons produced by protons that have undergone only a single pion loss .",
    "thus , this rise in the photon fraction , for particles with energy greater than @xmath27 , only begins to terminate once the photon flux becomes significantly absorbed through subsequent pair production interactions .",
    "so far in the paper we have ignored the effect introduced by the presence of magnetic fields on the cosmic ray proton trajectories . without such effects , both uhecr protons and photons propagate rectilinearly from the injection shell to earth and hence the photon fraction arriving from each shell is as presented in fig .",
    "[ photon_fractions ] for the homogeneous distribution of sources assumption must be considered a lower bound . however , for consistency with the relatively strong extra - galactic magnetic fields of more than 0.1  ng required for the termination of the @xmath23 cascade , we here discuss the effects introduced by proton diffusion in the extra - galactic magnetic fields .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for larmor radii significantly larger than the coherence scale of the ordered magnetic field , a charged particle propagating through a uniform magnetic field of coherence length , @xmath63 , will undergo a deflection of size @xmath29=@xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the larmor radius of the proton .",
    "a particle traversing a distance @xmath35 , through @xmath66 randomly orientated magnetic patches of size @xmath63 , will therefore random walk in angle space , being deflected on average by @xmath67 such angular diffusion leads to the largest increase in path - length the proton propagates , compared to the field - free rectilinear distance , for the `` lower energy '' protons under consideration .",
    "the effect on the proton propagation is to lead to an increased effective distance , @xmath68 , which the protons propagate relative to the straight - line distance , @xmath35 , with the relative increase given by , @xmath69 .",
    "thus , a ng strength extra - galactic magnetic field would lead to a @xmath010% increase in a 10@xmath1  ev proton s path - length for an @xmath35 of 100  mpc .    for the homogeneous distribution of sources scenario ,",
    "the contribution to the fluxes of protons and photons arriving at 10@xmath1  ev from different source distances is shown in fig .",
    "[ ensemble_results_breakdown ] . the arriving proton flux at 10@xmath1  ev is seen to be dominated by sources beyond several hundred mpc .",
    "similarly the 10@xmath1  ev photon flux , which results from roughly 10@xmath7  ev proton losses , receives its dominant contribution from sources @xmath0100  mpc at this energy . with the photons propagating rectilinearly to earth , and the effective proton propagation path being proportional to the inverse square of the proton s energy , the overall path extension of the two routes ( @xmath70 propagation to earth and @xmath71 and subsequent @xmath72 propagation to earth ) is dominated by the proton s ( ie .",
    "first route ) path extension .",
    "thus , at 10@xmath1  ev , the increase in path - length for the protons can be expected to be significantly larger than that of the arriving photons . with the arriving flux from each radial source element being constant for this scenario , the effect of diffusion",
    "is to weight the contribution from the more local sources relative to that from the more distant sources .",
    "hence the effect of diffusion , for the homogeneous source scenario , is in fact similar to the case of a local source over - density . for a 0.1  ng field ,",
    "a resulting mild , @xmath010% , decrease of the arriving proton flux to the arriving photon flux at 10@xmath1  ev , leads to a similarly mild increase in the photon fraction @xmath010@xmath1  ev relative to the values obtained in the previous sections which ignored magnetic field deflection effects .",
    "should the uhecr protons be born into a region of large magnetic field , their larmor radius will be comparable or even smaller than the magnetic field coherence scale ( which we here assume to be 1  mpc ) .",
    "if this occurs , the cosmic rays propagation may become diffusive , and a consideration of the magnetic field structure on smaller scales should be considered . if such a regime were entered for uhecr close to the source region , the photon fractions expected could be considerably larger than the values obtained here . in this respect , our photon fractions results should be considered as lower bound values .",
    "with increasing uhecr proton energy , the sudden onset of the pion - production process @xmath010@xmath19  ev due to a combination of both the low energy resonance - like cross - section for this process and the sharply peaked nature of the cmb s black - body distribution leads to a very sudden decrease in the interaction length for uhecr protons propagating through intergalactic space and consequently a sudden growth of the secondary uhe photon flux produced through these interactions .",
    "this , in combination with the relatively large mass of the pion to that of the proton ( @xmath730.15 ) , results in a sudden decrease also in the attenuation length of uhecr protons . despite the fact that the uhe photons produced also interact themselves with the cmb photons through a resonance - like cross - section , their interaction length in fact increases with energy due to the klein - nishina suppression of these interactions which occur with @xmath74 ( ie .",
    "@xmath75 ) , where @xmath43 is the squared center - of - mass energy of the collision and @xmath76 is the rest - mass of the electron ( the propagator in these interactions ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean - free - path of uhe photons increases with energy , becoming comparable to the attenuation length of protons at 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath59  ev ( depending on the extra - galactic radio background strength assumed ) , leading to the possibility of a relatively large photon content in the arriving uhecr flux at earth .",
    "the spectral shape of the gzk feature of the arriving proton flux has been demonstrated to have a very simple to understand origin through an analytic expression for the spatial and energy distributions of protons emitted by a single source , taking into account their subsequent cooling through photo - pion production interactions . using the individual spectra from the different shells considered ,",
    "the change in the spectral cut - off feature of the arriving uhecr spectrum was found for both a local over - density and under - density scenario .",
    "a local over - density of sources lead to a slight delay to higher energies of this cut - off feature , along with it having softer cut - off spectral shape .",
    "on the other hand , for the local under - density scenario , the introduction of a local hole of uhecr sources surrounding the earth out to @xmath010  mpc , or even @xmath030  mpc , lead to a much steeper spectral cut - off feature being obtained .",
    "the photon fraction results obtained , plotted as a function of uhecr energy , was shown to exhibit a double peaked feature .",
    "this feature was observed to be present in all scenarios considered ( see figs .  [ photon_fractions],[photon_fractions_enhancement],[photon_fractions_void ] ) provided the extra - galactic magnetic field strength was sufficiently strong ( more than @xmath00.1  ng ) that the @xmath23 cascades were prevented from developing , with inverse compton cooling being out - competed by synchrotron cooling for the uhe electrons . in all cases considered , the higher energy second peak peaked roughly at the cut - off energy of the proton injection spectrum , @xmath27 .",
    "this being demonstrated to be the case explicitly in fig .",
    "[ photon_fraction_cut - off ] for several different values of maximum proton energy , @xmath27 . for sufficiently large values of the maximum proton injection energy by the sources ( @xmath7710@xmath7  ev ) , the higher energy second peak in the photon fraction was larger than the lower energy first peak , with larger values of @xmath27 increasing the height of this peak . furthermore , the introduction of a hole region around the earth , void of uhecr sources , lead to a further increase in the photon fraction at this peak value , at energies close to @xmath27 .",
    "however , the introduction of a local over - density of sources into the nearby ( surrounding @xmath0250  mpc ) region was found to only mildly reduce this high energy peak in the photon fraction , increasing instead the lower energy peak .    with the prospect of even higher statistic rates at energies above the gzk cut - off with an auger north detector ,",
    "information about the uhecr sources through the photon fraction information holds great promise . already , with the current auger statistics , the photon fraction limits effectively exclude any , either homogeneous or local , topological origin scenario for uhecr @xcite . following these results , the next step will be the more difficult task of using the photon fraction information to probe the local uhecr source distribution . in this paper , we have investigated possible results expected in this regard , demonstrating that photon fractions in the range 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath11 present realistic lower bound values .",
    "the photon component of the uhecr spectrum has here been demonstrated to be a useful diagnostic tool for : +   + confirmation that the cut - off feature at the high energy end of the uhecr spectrum originates from proton photo - pion interactions with background photons was shown to be promising for a range of radio backgrounds , extra - galactic magnetic field strengths , and cut - off energies , as demonstrated in figs .",
