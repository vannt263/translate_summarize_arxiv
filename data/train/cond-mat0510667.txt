    "<S> inspection of the crystal structure and analysis of the magnetic susceptibility show that these provide us with a rare opportunity for a thorough investigation of geometric frustration in kagom magnets , all the more as large single crystals can be grown .    geometric frustration is currently attracting strong attention for the numerous novel phenomena it might generate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is classically featured by macroscopic degeneracies which prevent magnetic order to set up , thus allowing for new states of matter and unconventional excitations to come out @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath44 coefficients are deduced from the crystal symmetry at the @xmath26-th ion position , which consists of only a two fold axis : @xmath45 for the ion at ( x 0 0 ) , @xmath46 for the ion at ( 0 x 0 ) and @xmath47 for the ion at ( -x -x 0 ) , where x = 0.41809(2 ) for ngs ( see table [ crystdata ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> on choosing @xmath48 as the quantization axis , adopting the three fold @xmath49 axis as the common @xmath50 axis for all the ions and completing with the appropriate @xmath51 axis so that @xmath52 forms a right handed frame , @xmath27 writes @xmath53 terms of order 4 and 6 in @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 do not depend on the @xmath26-th ion since , with respect to the @xmath52 frame , the same crystal environment is seen by the @xmath26-th ion . </S>",
    "<S> we deduce on rotating the stevens operators @xcite that @xmath57    we observe first that @xmath58 does not depend upon the orientation of @xmath19 within the plane perpendicular to @xmath49 , which means that the in - plane anisotropy observed at low temperature should arise from higher order terms in the crystal electric field potential . in ngs , a linear fit of @xmath17 above 100 k and of @xmath16 above 300 k using the slope fitted from @xmath17 yields a paramagnetic nel temperature @xmath59 = -52 k , an effective moment @xmath60 = 3.77 @xmath61 , close to the value of the nd@xmath9 free ion , and a quadrupolar electric field parameter @xmath62 = -6.35 k. no such quantitative analysis is possible in pgs because the temperatures at which @xmath16 and @xmath17 are linear and parallel to each other are beyond the experimental range , but negative @xmath59 and @xmath63 should be expected . as a matter of fact @xmath64 in both ngs and pgs since @xmath65 at high temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we computed both @xmath55 and @xmath56 for ngs in a point charge model considering the eight oxygen anions coordinating the nd@xmath9 ion and forming a distorted square antiprism around it . </S>",
    "<S> generally the as - computed absolute values differ significantly from the actual ones , but the @xmath66 ratios are better determined and a much greater confidence should be put on them . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath67 , which suggests that the nd magnetic moments behave at high temperature most probably as coplanar rotators perpendicular to @xmath49 with an orientational preference along the @xmath51 axis for the @xmath26-th ion within the ( @xmath51 , @xmath68 ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> a more complex behavior should occur at lower temperature where higher order terms of the crystal electric field compete with the quadrupolar one .        </S>",
    "<S> a fact of outmost importance was that , although finite values of the paramagnetic nel temperature @xmath59 are deduced , no anomaly is detected in the magnetic susceptibilities of both ngs and pgs indicating that a disordered phase would persist down to the lowest temperature despite antiferromagnetic interactions of one order of magnitude larger in energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> an elastic neutron scattering test experiment was performed using a powder sample of ngs on the d20 high flux diffractometer at the institut lae langevin that confirms the absence of any magnetic ordering . as evidenced in fig.[d20exp ] </S>",
    "<S> no increase in the bragg intensity nor emergence of new bragg intensity are observed on the neutron pattern on decreasing the temperature from 100 k down to 2 k.    in short , geometric frustration in nd@xmath0ga@xmath1sio@xmath2 ( ngs ) and pr@xmath0ga@xmath1sio@xmath2 ( pgs ) appears to inhibit condensation into a nel phase and to favor a disordered phase down to the lowest temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we recently performed inelastic neutron scattering experiment on both polycrystals and single crystals evidencing liquid like dynamical spin - spin correlations with unusual dispersive features @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as from the present study of ngs and pgs , we expect that the series of r@xmath0ga@xmath1sio@xmath2 compounds with the other rare earth r should show valuable magnetic behaviors inherent to geometric frustration . as such they are of as much interest as from their piezoelectric properties . </S>"
