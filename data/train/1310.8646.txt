    "an inductive application of lemma  [ lem : morse_lemma ] shows that every sublevel set of @xmath51 is contractible .",
    "but the whole complex is the limit of these , thus contractible as well .    from theorems",
    "[ thm : gromov ] , [ thm : cartan - hadamard ] and [ thm : contractible ] and corollary  [ cor : flag ] we get :    [ cor : cat0 ] @xmath51 is @xmath0 .",

    "we want to explain how their construction carries over to graph products of general cyclic groups and how it relates to the construction from section  [ sec : complex ] .    the graph @xmath131 has vertices @xmath136 and edges are given by pulling back the edges from @xmath3 via the obvious projection to @xmath5",

    "each of the vertices in @xmath141 keeps its label and the vertices in @xmath142 are labeled by @xmath133 . for a vertex @xmath143 davis  januzskiewicz denote these elements @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "the graph products associated to these groups are related via the maps @xmath148 and @xmath149 which are easily seen to be injective .",
    "in fact , letting @xmath6 denote the subgroup of @xmath150 generated by the elements @xmath151 we see that @xmath150 can be written as semidirect products @xmath152 where the action is always trivial on @xmath141 and on the remaining generators is given by @xmath153 this can be seen for example by writing @xmath154 and then applying tietze transformations to remove generators .",
    "these algebraic considerations play the role of the geometric arguments in @xcite .",
    "one of the main ingredients here is that the groups @xmath2 and @xmath155 do indeed admit the described actions of the group @xmath6 .",
    "the basic example to keep in mind is the following .",
    "if @xmath1 has just one vertex labeled @xmath52 , then @xmath156 can be thought of as the real line .",
    "then @xmath2 is the group generated by an element @xmath28 which is translation by @xmath133 .",
    "the group @xmath155 is generated by elements @xmath157 and @xmath158 which are reflection at @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath150 is generated by elements @xmath157 and @xmath161 which are reflection at @xmath159 and @xmath123 .",
    "it is clear from the description that @xmath131 is isomorphic to the graph @xmath34 from section  [ sec : complex ] .",
    "therefore @xmath162 is isomorphic to @xmath163",
    ". we will show below that they are also isomorphic to @xmath164 .",
    "note that @xmath165 is not typically homeomorphic to these complexes .",

    "the importance of @xmath132 lies not so much in the complex @xmath165 but rather in the group @xmath134 .    to show that @xmath150 acts on @xmath54 and @xmath166 and that both are equivariantly isomorphic , we define a third complex @xmath167 , that is a coset complex of @xmath150 .",
