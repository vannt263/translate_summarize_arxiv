    "the reionization of the universe , which took place around a redshift of 10.5 @xcite , is generally believed to be driven primarily by ionizing photons from early ` population iii ' ( pop - iii ) stars .",
    "as these stars form from primordial unenriched , metal - free hydrogen and helium , they undergo a formation process that is substantially different from that of later population i and ii stars .",
    "simulations of the production of pop - iii stars generally find an initial mass function ( imf ) that is heavily biased towards high masses , 10  1000 . a considerable fraction of the radiant energy from these stars is released at ionizing wavelengths ( @xmath5  ) , which allows reionization of the universe to be completed on the timescale required by lyman-@xmath1  forest data @xcite . despite their importance in cosmology and impact on igm evolution ,",
    "pop - iii stars continue to evade direct detection .",
    "detecting the redshifted uv emission from pop - iii stars is a primary goal of the upcoming _ james webb space telescope _",
    ", though even with the state of the art sensitivity of this instrument detecting individual metal - free stars will be challenging @xcite .",
    "searching for indirect evidence of these stars and their integrated cosmological impact is therefore the primary way of understanding the properties of the reionization - era universe .",
    "photon production from the reionization era is encoded in the evolving spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the accumulated photon background , which we observe locally as the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) . redshifted uv radiation from pop - iii stars",
    "can be expected to appear as a distinct component of the near - ir portion of the ebl , and the spectral details of this observable light could in principle inform an observer about the redshift of reionization and the nature of the sources responsible .",
    "however , observations of the absolute intensity of the ebl in the near - ir are severely hindered by the presence of bright galactic foregrounds , which are produced by diverse sources including stars and the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way and ` zodiacal light ' from dust within our solar system .",
    "it has been proposed that a high level of ir background could be due to radiation from the first generation of stars .",
    "multiple experiments , most notably the dirbe experiment on the cobe satellite , have attempted to measure the sky brightness at near - ir wavelengths , and foreground subtraction analyses have been presented by a number of authors , with extragalactic components generally exceeding the contribution of resolvable galaxies . as discussed in @xcite ( gspd11 ) ,",
    "the discrepancies between these various measurements are largely due to the models for the impact of zodiacal light assumed .",
    "the irts experiment on the space flyer satellite found an even higher measurement than dirbe in the near - ir at 1.4 to 4  @xcite , and linked this radiation excess to pop - iii formation .",
    "other findings have cast doubt on this interpretation of the high near - ir background flux arising from reionization - era sources .",
    "tev - scale observations by ground - based atmospheric cherenkov telescopes can constrain the ebl at wavelengths from the uv to the far - ir through the optical depth introduced by pair - production interactions with background photons to gamma rays from extragalactic sources such as gamma - ray emitting blazars",
    ". constraints of this type , which assume a limit to the intrinsic hardness of gamma - ray spectra , have generally found agreement with a low value for the ebl in the near - ir . while these limits can be violated in some circumstances , a ebl flux as high as that measured by the irts experiment and the higher dirbe claims would almost certainly not be possible without the emergence of new physics .",
    "moreover , ( hereafter ms05 ) investigated the theoretical implication of the claim of a large ir background excess , and found that creating a near - ir background excess would be inconsistent with the observed chemical enrichment history of galaxies .    in this work ,",
    "we revisit the possibility of constraining the contribution of reionization - era stars to the ebl using gamma - ray observations , and we then address the corresponding limits on high - redshift star formation .",
    "rather than focusing on the relatively low - redshift blazars that have been viewed with ground - based gamma - ray telescopes and that have been the target of aforementioned ebl studies , here we explore the implications of the most distant sources observed by the large - area telescope ( lat ) on the _ fermi _ satellite at lower gev energies .",
    "the gamma - ray optical depth for high - redshift blazars and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) due to the ebl produced by galaxies in a variety of models was the topic of a recent _ fermi _ collaboration paper @xcite .",
    "however , none of the ebl models discussed in this paper included explicitly a contribution from the high - redshift uv sources responsible for reionization , like pop - iii stars .",
    "here , we will employ a similar method to @xcite , by using the highest energy photons seen from several high - redshift sources , together with the spectrum observed at lower energies , to put an upper limit on the background flux , and we treat the flux from pop - iii stars as a separate component from the ebl produced by later galaxies .",
    "our work is also related to the calculation of @xcite ( rkm09 ) , which examined the limits possible on low- and zero - metallicity stars from gamma - ray data and placed limits on reionization - era star formation from redshifts 7 to 15 .",
    "this analysis was limited to considering the ebl bounds placed by comparatively low - redshift tev blazars , rather than the high redshift gev sources we consider in this work .",
    "the prospects of using high redshift observations with _ fermi _ , in particular of distant gamma - ray bursts , as probes of light originating in the reionization era was noted in @xcite and .",
    "these papers recognized that the gamma - ray optical depth introduced by photons from early stars would create a @xmath6 dependence in the gamma - ray mean free path , due to the constant comoving number density of the resulting background photons , and that the highest - redshift sources would therefore be the most sensitive to the spectral signature of this radiation .",
    "high redshift gamma - ray spectra , when used as a probe of background photons , can therefore effectively isolate an ebl component originating in the early universe .",
    "though the lat has been less successful at detecting high - energy grbs than envisioned by these authors , high - redshift detections of both grbs and blazars have been made at energies above 10 gev , and these are sufficient to constrain a large excess at the shorter bands of the near - ir wavelengths .    in the next section ,",
    "we first review the calculations of the buildup of background photons and the phenomenon of gamma - ray attenuation through electron - positron pair - production , and then describe a model for the sed of the background component of pop - iii stars . in section [ sec : results ] , we present our results for the limits that can be obtained from observed gamma - ray sources on the portion of the local ebl that originates from high - redshift , followed by upper bounds on the total rate of pop - iii star formation . section [ sec : disc ] presents conclusions and the prospects of strengthening our limits with future high - redshift gamma - ray source detections .",
    "we assume a @xmath7cdm cosmology with parameters consistent with a maximum likelihood results of @xcite in this work : @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "to examine the effect that the photon populations created during reionization have on gamma - ray propagation , we will develop template seds that describe the emissivity of the universe during these early times .",
    "these templates can be freely rescaled to simulate varying star - formation rate densities .",
    "they are described in full detail in  [ sec : spectmod ] .    in the following sections",
    ", we will treat independently the hypothetical ebl component from reionization - era pop - iii stars and the component produced primarily by later population i / ii stars .",
    "we will distinguish between these by referring to the first as the reionization - era ebl ( ` r - ebl ' ) and the second as the post - reionization ebl ( ` p - ebl ' ) .",
    "we emphasize that this work is not intended to comment on the relationship between these components , or the details of how the transition from pop - iii to population - ii star formation occurs , but only to examine some possible scenarios for the r - ebl , of which we presently have only indirect evidence .",
    "in general , the ebl in place at a given redshift @xmath10 can be calculated by an integral over source terms at all redshifts @xmath11 , with additional terms describing the effect of redshift on photon wavelength and flux redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the galaxy emissivity at redshift @xmath14 and frequency @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the cosmological line element , defined as @xmath17 for a flat @xmath7cdm universe @xcite .",
    "an ebl component originating entirely above a redshift @xmath18 will evolve only through passive redshifting at @xmath19 , with an invariant comoving photon number density .",
    "if this component is observed locally with a spectral energy distribution @xmath20 , then the proper flux of these photons at redshift @xmath19 is @xmath21    if @xmath22 refers in this case to the ebl produced by early low metallicity stars , and @xmath18 is the end of the era of preeminence of these sources , then it is easy to see that @xmath23 will become an increasingly large fraction of the total background as @xmath14 approaches @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the majority of the background light emerging from resolved galaxies after reionization in recent models ( e.g. @xcite ) comes from redshifts considerably lower than @xmath18 . in the fiducial model of @xcite , for instance ,",
    "@xmath24 per cent of p - ebl photons between 0.1 and 10 microns are emitted at @xmath25 , and 96 per cent at @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath16 is the cosmological line element , equation [ eq : cosline ] .    the proper photon number density of a passively evolving component increases as @xmath46 , and the gamma - ray attenuation per unit proper distance at a given energy therefore increases by the same ratio .",
    "we can place the strongest constraints on reionization - era fields using the highest redshift gamma - ray sources available , provided that these gamma rays satisfy the minimal energy condition discussed above .",
    "several emission processes can contribute to the cosmological emissivity at the time of reionization .",
    "the fact that we are interested only in the broadband features of the spectrum , with integration over a range in redshift , will allow us to make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "a simple description of the stellar spectrum at non - ionizing wavelengths as a thermal blackbody is sufficient for massive pop - iii stars that emit a large portion of their energy at ionizing wavelengths @xcite .",
    "ionizing radiation will undergo processing by neutral hydrogen within the host halo and eventually emerge at longer wavelengths , and the fraction of emission that leaves the host halo ( denoted by the escape fraction @xmath47 ) will be similarly affected by the neutral hydrogen residing the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the contribution of stars with masses from 5 to 500  to the cosmological background radiation . for this purpose ,",
    "we create rest - frame sed templates that include the stellar contribution as a truncated blackbody , plus lyman-@xmath1 , free - bound , and two - photon emission from reprocessed ionizing radiation .",
    "the mean free path for ionizing radiation is assumed to be short at all wavelengths we consider , and our templates have no emission above the lyman limit .",
    "we ignore the contribution to the spectrum from free - free interactions . while important at longer wavelengths , these only account for a small fraction of the emission at optical and uv wavelengths that are the main concern in this work .",
    "likewise we ignore the contribution of other recombination lines , which have only a relatively small effect that occurs at longer wavelengths .",
    "while these templates are not intended to accurately represent fine spectral features , they do provide a reasonable estimate of the energy released into the cosmological background photon fields by early stars at rest - frame wavelengths from the lyman limit to the optical , and can be raised or lowered to describe the output from a given global star - formation history .",
    "the imf of low- and zero- metallicity stars is highly uncertain .",
    "therefore , we consider two different possible imfs in this work .",
    "the first is a simple salpeter - like power law function from 5 to 500 , while the second is a much more top - heavy larson @xcite imf , defined as @xmath48 which has a salpeter slope at high masses ( @xmath49 ) and a flat slope at lower masses , reducing the number of low - mass stars .",
    "following @xcite , and to allow a comparison with them in the next section , we set @xmath50 .",
    "our investigation of two different possibilities is motivated by the suggestion from simulations that there is a critical metallicity below which the formation of low - mass stars is strongly inhibited , leading to an imf that is considerably more top - heavy than later population ii stars @xcite . whether this leads exclusively to very high mass stars ( e.g. @xmath51 ) , and/or to a significant departure from a salpeter - like slope in the high mass imf ( @xmath52 , @xcite ) is disputed by various authors .    for the stellar component",
    "we apply a blackbody spectrum down to a wavelength 912  .",
    "descriptions of the spectral temperatures , lifetimes , and number of ionizing photons released by pop - iii stars are taken from @xcite . as noted here and in , the collective emission properties of high - mass stars _ per stellar mass _ are highly insensitive to mass above a certain threshold , @xmath53 . above this threshold ,",
    "stars are well described by an effective temperature @xmath54 k , and release @xmath55 hydrogen - ionizing photons per solar mass over a lifetime . in the regime between the 5  cutoff and this mass scale a dependence on the imf still exists . in the case of our salpeter imf ,",
    "about 81 per cent of mass in a zero - age population exists in stars of less than 100 , and about half in stars less than 20 , necessitating consideration of this deviation from the high - mass properties . in the case of the larson imf ,",
    "@xmath56  stars contain only about one third of all stellar mass .",
    "integrated properties with this imf are therefore closer to what would be expected of an extreme imf , populated only by @xmath51  stars .",
    "the lyman-@xmath1 line is the most significant spectral feature expected to appear in the reionization - era background .",
    "while higher - order lyman - series lines are suppressed by repeated scattering event in the igm , the photons in the @xmath1 line will eventually escape out of resonance due to redshifting and propagate freely through the universe .",
    "this is true regardless of whether the conversion of ionizing radiation to lyman-@xmath1  occurs inside the host halo or outside in the igm .",
    "the overall spectrum is therefore not significantly impacted by the ionizing escape fraction , which determines this ratio . while varying the escape fraction can alter the shape of the angular perturbations in the near - ir ebl @xcite , the broadband properties of the uv emission are not affected by the details of this process . a simple assumption to determine",
    "the line strength is that some fraction of the energy emitted at ionizing wavelengths ( which is excluded from the stellar spectrum ) eventually emerges as lyman-@xmath1  emission .",
    "following @xcite , eq .",
    "( 27 ) , we assume 0.75 lyman-@xmath1  photons for each h - ionizing photon , plus an additional 0.53 for each he - ii ionizing photon .",
    "the latter occur at about half the rate of hydrogen ionizing photons , for a high - mass star .",
    "free - bound and free - free continuum radiation account for a sub - dominant component of the emission in the uv .",
    "we include a description of the free - bound contribution in our spectral model , as per the derivation in .",
    "as in that work , we assume an average gas temperature of @xmath57 k. @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the star - formation rate density ( sfrd ) in units of  yr@xmath3 mpc@xmath4 , and @xmath60 is the average number of ionizing photons released by the creation of 1 solar mass of stars for an assumed imf .",
    "@xmath61 = 13.6 ev , @xmath62 is the free - bound gaunt factor and @xmath63 is the recombination coefficient to all states other than the ground state , as described in @xcite , table 5.2",
    ". both of these are close to one for our purposes .",
    "the summation over energy levels is truncated at n=3 in our calculation , as higher levels mainly contribute to longer wavelengths",
    ".    a certain number of recombination photons will descend to the ground state by two - photon emission rather than lyman-@xmath1 . as described in @xcite , two photon emission",
    "is required for de - excitation of an electron in the @xmath64s state , where single photon emission is prohibited .",
    "the probability of this occurrence is a weak function of temperature , and we use the value of @xmath65 listed in table 9.1 of @xcite .",
    "the emitted spectrum , in terms of photon number , necessarily forms a symmetrical peak around 1/2 the lyman-@xmath1  energy ( 2432   or @xmath66 ) ; the majority of the two - photon flux emerges at uv wavelengths .",
    "the fitting function for the spectrum of two - photon emission used here is taken from : @xmath67    the total emissivity , which is then the input @xmath68 for eq .",
    "[ eq : eblint ] , is the sum of the lyman-@xmath1  , stellar , free - bound scattering , and two - photon contributions .",
    "we assume an instantaneous approximation for the emission of radiation , i.e. , all light from a star is emitted the instant the star is created . since the lifetime of high mass stars is very short compared to cosmological timescales ( 6.2 @xmath69 yr for a 5  star , 1.04 @xmath69 yr for a 15  star ; @xcite ) , this is reasonable approximation that will have little impact on our results .",
    "in  [ sec : thermlims ] , we begin by setting some general limits on the pop - iii contribution to the present - day ebl .",
    "this will be done by considering the highest energy photons detected from two distant gamma ray sources , and making the simple requirement that a passively evolving photon population not create an optical depth that is greater than 1 . in  [ sec : highzsf ] , we will address the how these limits on the ebl can be translated into bounds on pop - iii star formation .",

    "these results are sensitive to the nature of the sed types considered - for this exercise we have used blackbody spectra at a variety of temperatures and normalizations . because the optical depth from pair - production interactions ( eq .
