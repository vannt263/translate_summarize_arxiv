    "neutrino oscillation is a very rich and interesting problem in its own right .",
    "this problem is not only connected to modern particle physics but also to cosmology , astrophysics and other diverse branches , having interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "mass neutrino mixing and oscillations were first studied and proposed by pontecorvo @xcite , then mikheyev , smirnov and wolfenstein ( msw for short ) had discussed the effect of transformation of one neutrino flavor into another in a varying density medium @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , the mass neutrino oscillation has been a hot topic and there have been many theoretical ( @xcite-@xcite ) and as well as many experimental ( @xcite-@xcite ) studies .",
    "neutrino oscillations first formulated in flat spacetime has been extended to curved spacetime ( @xcite-@xcite ) and it has been used to test equivalence principle recently @xcite .",
    "oscillation phase along the geodesic line will produce a factor of @xmath2 in the high energy limit when compared to the value along a null geodesic .",
    "this factor of 2 exists in both flat and schwarzschild spacetime as shown by several authors ( @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the issue regarding this factor of @xmath2 is due to the difference between the time - like and null geodesics .",
    "also there exists some alternative mechanisms to take into account the effect of gravitational field on neutrino flavor oscillation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "neutrino oscillation in non - inertial frame has also drawn some attention recently ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there have been extensive study of neutrino oscillation in spacetime with both curvature and torsion ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    ", there have been a boost in the research on application of neutrino oscillation in various astrophysical contexts .",
    "the pulsar kicks mechanism , based on spin flavor conversion of neutrino , which is propagating in a gravitational field has been discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that pulsars have a very high proper motion with reference to surrounding stars .",
    "these suggest that pulsars undergo some kind of impulse or kick . in spite of many proposals in this direction",
    "this still remain an open issue .",
    "the above pulsar kick mechanism can also be explained by introducing _",
    "neutrinospheres _ and resonant oscillation @xmath3 between these _",
    "neutrinospheres_. this kind of neutrino oscillation in presence of strong magnetic field leads to such high proper motion of pulsars @xcite .",
    "other studies on neutrino oscillation mainly focusses on the fact that though the mass squared differences and mixing angles are well observed , the absolute value of neutrino masses are not properly known , leading to neutrino masses being hierarchical or quasi - degenerate in nature . along with",
    "there are extensive works on the mixing angle @xmath4 , cp violation in neutrino oscillation and the effects of non vanishing @xmath5 mixing .",
    "there exists a number of theoretical models , for example , considering neutrino masses to be degenerate at some seasaw scale , large mixing angle for solar and atmospheric neutrinos using renormalization group equations in order to address these issues ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "there have been some recent developments regarding different astrophysical aspects of alternative gravity theories ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider neutrino oscillation in some classes of alternative gravity theories . for simplicity",
    "we discuss only spherically symmetric solutions in alternative theories of gravitation , but interestingly they all turn out to have important implications .",
    "we have derived quiet generally for all spherically symmetric solution of a particular form ( see equation ( [ neu9 ] ) ) that @xmath6 and we have only taken the high energy limit but not weak field approximation .",
    "we have discussed three spherically symmetric solutions in this paper .",
    "first one corresponds to vacuum solution to @xmath1 gravity , which is the schwarzschild ( anti-)de sitter solution and have a great importance today regarding the cosmological constant .",
    "we have put an bound on the cosmological parameter in this solution from the present day solar neutrino data .",
    "secondly we consider einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet ( emgb ) gravity in five dimension and a spherically symmetric solution has been discussed @xcite .",
    "there we put bounds on the gb parameter @xmath7 using solar neutrino oscillation data .",
    "finally we discuss charged solution in @xmath1 gravity and different parameter have been estimated .",
    "finally we calculate the proper oscillation length in all these spherically symmetric spacetime . the oscillation length is found proportional to @xmath8 , the local energy measurement .",
    "decrease in local energy leads to decrease in oscillation length as the neutrino travels out the gravitational field .",
    "thus blueshift of oscillation length occurs in contrast to redshift for light signal , which is an interesting result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ neuflat ] ) we give a brief review of neutrino oscillation in flat spacetime , next in section ( [ neustat ] ) we discuss the neutrino oscillation in general static spherically symmetric spacetime . then we consider neutrino oscillation in different classes of alternative gravity theories and proper oscillation length in these theories .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion on our results . throughout the paper",
    "we have used the units @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in this section we shall briefly review some properties of two flavor neutrino oscillation in flat spacetime which will be helpful for later developments . in standard treatment ,",
    "the flavor basis eigenstate , denoted by @xmath11 is actually a superposition of the mass basis eigenstates @xmath12 such that they are connected by a unitary transformation @xcite , @xmath13~\\vert \\nu _ { k}\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and the unitary matrix @xmath15 comprises the transformation between flavor and mass basis . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 corresponds to the energy and momentum of the mass eigenstates @xmath18 . for a neutrino which is produced at some spacetime point ,",
    "@xmath19 and detected at another spacetime point @xmath20 , the phase as presented in equation ( [ neu2 ] ) can be generalized to a co - ordinate independent form and become suitable for application in a curved spacetime .",
    "this could be given by ( @xcite,@xcite ) , @xmath21 where the 4-momentum is given by , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the rest mass corresponding to the mass eigenstate @xmath18 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 corresponds to the metric tensor and an affine parameter respectively . in the literature the mass eigenstates",
    "are usually taken to be the energy eigenstates with a common energy , up to @xmath26 .",
    "we use the approximation @xmath27 and assume massless trajectory implying that the neutrino travels along the null trajectory . for two flavor mixing @xmath28 , we can write @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the vacuum mixing angle .",
    "the oscillation probability that the neutrino which is produced as @xmath31 but detected as @xmath32 is given by @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the phase shift for neutrino flavor oscillation .",
    "the phase can also be expressed in terms of energy and position of creation and detection of the neutrino such that @xcite , @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the energy for a massless neutrino .",
    "so , the phase shift which is responsible for oscillation is given by , @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "in this section we shall discuss the neutrino oscillation along both null and timelike geodesics in a general static spherically symmetric spacetime with metric ansatz @xcite , @xmath39 we have restricted this discussion to four dimensions only , however it can be generalized to higher dimension in a straightforward manner .",
    "we shall restrict our motion in @xmath40 plane , due to spherical symmetry this would not hinder the general nature of the metric .",
    "the components of the canonical momenta of @xmath41th massive neutrino in equation ( [ neu4 ] ) are , @xmath42 where we have introduced @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the metric components do not depend on @xmath46 , thus we have a conserved energy per particle mass given by @xmath16 and the metric components also do not depend on @xmath47 leading to conserved angular momenta per particle mass @xmath48 .",
    "we could have @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the phase along null geodesic from point @xmath51 to point @xmath52 is given by ( @xcite,@xcite ) , @xmath53 in the literature the neutrino is usually taken to travel along the null line . thus we shall calculate the phase along light - ray trajectory from a to b. the lagrangian appropriate for the motion in @xmath40 plane is , @xmath54 the hamiltonian could be given by , @xmath55 from independence of hamiltonian on time @xmath46 we can easily derive the following result , @xmath56 we can take @xmath57 for time - like geodesics and @xmath58 for null geodesics without any loss of generality . substituting for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 from equation ( [ neu10 ] ) in equation ( [ neu14 ] ) for null geodesics leads to the radial equation of motion , @xmath62 now we define a new function such that , @xmath63 from this we have calculated the equations governing @xmath46 and @xmath47 as , @xmath64 the on - mass shell condition corresponds to , @xmath65 using equation ( [ neu10 ] ) into the on - mass shell condition we readily obtain , @xmath66 then using equations ( [ neu19 ] ) , ( [ neu17 ] ) , ( [ neu15 ] ) and ( [ neu10 ] ) in equation ( [ neu11 ] ) for phase we readily obtain , @xmath67 the phase as presented in equation ( [ neu20 ] ) is a general result . for different @xmath68 the function @xmath69 changes and hence the phase . if @xmath70 , then in the high energy limit we should have , @xmath71 , hence the phase has the following expression , @xmath72 which is the phase in schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "an ultra relativistic neutrino travels with speed very close to that of light and hence is considered to travel along the null line .",
    "however there exists significant difference between massive neutrino and photon , which becomes important while determining the key features of neutrino oscillation .",
    "thus for more general situation we should calculate the phase along time - like geodesics .",
    "an extra factor of 2 as mentioned earlier is obtained as we compare the time - like geodesic with null geodesic in high energy limit .",
    "this factor originates due to the fact that we have treated neutrino to be massive , while calculated the phase along the null and the time - like trajectory .",
    "thus this factor of 2 is a consequence of neutrino mass . for time like geodesic , setting @xmath57",
    ", we can derive from equation ( [ neu14 ] ) , @xmath73 note that the equations for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are same for time - like geodesics @xcite .",
    "however the radial equation becomes , @xmath74 then we have obtained expressions for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for time - like geodesics given by , @xmath77 using the on - mass shell condition we readily obtain , @xmath78 thus the phase along the time - like geodesic has the following expression @xmath79 in the high energy limit the above expression reduces to , @xmath80 the factor of @xmath2 exists in neutrino phase calculation for flat @xcite , schwarzschild ( @xcite,@xcite ) and kerr - newmann @xcite spacetime .",
    "here we again found that factor of @xmath2 for a general static spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "this factor appears since there exists intrinsic difference between time - like and null geodesics . in deriving the null phase we have used @xmath81-momentum which is along the time - like geodesic and @xmath82 , along the null geodesic",
    ", however for time - like phase we have derived both the quantities keeping them along time - like geodesics , this leads to that factor of @xmath2 , which is a general feature of any curved spacetime .",
    "current theoretical models of cosmology have two fundamental problems , namely inflation and the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "the usual scenarios used to explain both of these accelerating epochs are to develop acceptable dark energy models , which includes : scalar , spinor , cosmological constant and higher dimensions .",
    "even if such a model seems to be partially successful it is mainly hindered by the coupling with the usual matter and hence its compatibility with standard elementary particle theories .",
    "however another natural choice is the classical generalization of general relativity , which is called modified gravity or alternative gravity theory ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus a gravitational alternative is needed to explain both inflation and dark energy seems reasonable on the ground of the expectation that general relativity is an approximation valid at small curvature .",
    "the sector of modified gravity theory which contains the gravitational terms , relevant at high energy have produced the inflationary epoch . during evolution",
    "the curvature decreases and hence general relativity describes to a good approximation the intermediate universe . with a further decrease of curvature",
    "as the sub - dominant terms gradually grow we observe a transition from deceleration to cosmic acceleration .",
    "there exists many models including traditional @xmath1 , string inspired models , scalar tensor theories , gauss - bonnet theory and many others . in the next subsections we shall discuss neutrino oscillations in three spherically symmetric solutions for different alternative gravity theories .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) is widely accepted as one of the fundamental theory relating matter energy density to geometric properties of the spacetime .",
    "the standard cosmological model can explain the evolution of the universe except inflation and late time cosmic acceleration , as already mentioned .",
    "although many scalar field models have been proposed earlier in the frame work of string theory and super - gravity to explain inflation however cosmic microwave background radiation does not show any evidence in favor of some model .",
    "the same kind of approach has also been taken to explain cosmic acceleration by introducing different dark energy models where concrete observation is still missing .",
    "thus one of the simplest choice is modification of gr action by introducing a term @xmath1 in the lagrangian , where @xmath83 is some arbitrary function of the scalar curvature @xmath84 .",
    "there exists two methods for deriving field equations , first , we can vary the action with respect to metric tensor @xmath24 , the other method which is called palatini method is not discussed here . in f(r )",
    "gravity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the einstein - hilbert action @xmath85 gets replaced by an action appropriate for the introduction of the function of scalar curvature : @xmath86",
    "varying this action we readily obtain the corresponding field equation in this gravity theory to be given by , @xmath87 now we shall discuss two class of solutions for the above set of einstein equations involving vacuum solution and charged black hole solution in @xmath1 gravity .",
    "several solutions ( sometimes exact ) to this field equation has been obtained , however due to complicated nature , number of such exact solutions are much less than that in classical general relativity .",
    "there exists a ( a)ds - schwarzschild solution that corresponds to a vacuum solution ( @xmath88 ) for which the ricci scalar is covariantly constant .",
    "this also corresponds to @xmath89 .",
    "since @xmath90 for this case equation ( @xmath91 ) reduces to the following algebraic equation , @xmath92 it is evident that the model @xmath93 satisfy the above equation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence the ( a)ds - schwarzschild is an exact vacuum solution to this situation with respective line element given by , @xmath94 here the minus(plus ) sign corresponds to ( anti-)de sitter space , @xmath95 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath96 is the length parameter of ( anti-)de sitter space , which is related to the scalar curvature @xmath97 ( the plus sign corresponds to de sitter space and minus sign corresponds to anti - de sitter space ) .",
    "the phase along null line is given by , @xmath98 and the phase along the geodesic line has the following expression , @xmath99      in this section we consider charged solutions for @xmath1 gravity having the form given by @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "all such viable modifications in gravity must pass through all the tests from the large scale structure of the universe to solar system .",
    "when the correction factor to the einstein gravity action is of exponential form , it is possible to show that it does not contradicts solar system tests @xcite . also in addition the solutions from this model is mostly identical to that from einstein gravity except a change in newton s constant @xcite . using the function given by @xmath1 we readily obtain topological charged solution in which the function @xmath68 as given by equation ( [ neu9 ] ) leads to @xcite , @xmath101 in this solution we should set some parameters and following the approach as presented in @xcite we easily read off the parameters such that the following relations are satisfied , @xmath102 with the following solutions @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we can also reverse the argument i.e. setting @xmath103 and @xmath104 and deriving that equation ( [ ch1 ] ) satisfies field equations . to interpret the charge term we need scalar - tensor representation of @xmath1 gravity theory .",
    "then the neutrino phase along the null line has the following expression , @xmath105 while that along the geodesic goes by the following expression , @xmath106 where @xmath16 and @xmath48 are the energy and angular momentum respectively of the neutrino and @xmath68 is given by equation ( [ ch1 ] ) .",
    "theories with extra spatial dimension have been an area of considerable interest since the original work of kaluza and klein .",
    "the advent of string theory boosts this issue which predicts the presence of extra spatial dimension . among the large number of alternatives the brane world scenario is considered as a strong candidate which has theoretical basis in some underlying string theory .",
    "usually , the effect of string theory on classical gravitational theories ( @xcite , @xcite ) are investigated using of a low energy effective action , which in addition to the einstein - hilbert action contain squares and higher powers of the curvature term .",
    "however the field equations become of fourth order and brings in ghosts @xcite . in this context lovelock @xcite showed that if higher curvature terms appear in a particular combination in the action , the field equation becomes of second order .    in einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet ( emgb ) gravity , the action in the five dimensional spacetime ( @xmath107 )",
    "can be written as , @xmath108,\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the gb lagrangian and @xmath110 is the lagrangian for the matter part i.e. electromagnetic field . here",
    "@xmath7 is the coupling constant for the gb term having dimension of @xmath111 .",
    "as @xmath7 is regarded as the inverse string tension , so we must have @xmath112 .",
    "the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations are obtained by varying the above action with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath113 ( see @xcite ) , @xmath114-\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu \\nu}l_{gb } \\end{array}\\right \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "a spherically symmetric solution to the above field equations has been obtained by @xcite and the line element has the following expression , @xmath116 where the metric co - efficient is , @xmath117\\ ] ] here @xmath118 is the curvature , @xmath119 is the geometrical mass of the spacetime and @xmath120 is the metric of a 3d hyper - surface such that , @xmath121 the range is given by @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "we have assumed that there is a constant charge @xmath123 at @xmath124 and the vector potential be @xmath125 such that @xmath126 .    in this metric",
    "the metric function @xmath127 will be real for @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the largest real root of this cubic equation , @xmath130 by a transformation of the radial co - ordinates one can show that @xmath131 is an essential singularity of the spacetime @xcite .    the phase along the null line has the explicit form , @xmath132 and the phase along the geodesic line could be given by , @xmath133 where @xmath127 is given by equation ( [ 49 ] ) .",
    "the propagation of a neutrino is well understood in terms of its proper length .",
    "however the quantity @xmath134 that appear in equation ( [ neu20 ] ) is only a coordinate .",
    "the proper distance has the following expression @xcite , @xmath135 for the metric ansatz as presented in equation ( [ neu9 ] ) and then using equation ( [ neu16 ] ) we readily obtain the proper distance to be given by , @xmath136^{-1/2}\\ ] ] for convenience we shall adopt the differential form of ( [ neu20 ] ) @xmath137 substituting ( [ neul2 ] ) we readily obtain , @xmath138 where it is generally assumed that the mass and energy eigenstates are identical with a common energy .",
    "the equal energy assumptions are taken to be correct by some authors ( @xcite , @xcite ) and has been studied carefully in papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "also it is adopted quite widely in a great deal of literature , that @xmath139 will represent the common energy of mass eigenstates .",
    "the condition of equal momentum has also been adopted in order to study the neutrino oscillation . in",
    "flat spacetime , both conditions represent the same neutrino oscillation results . due to the time and space translation invariance the",
    "free particle energy and momentum are conserved . in curved ,",
    "stationary spacetime , the energy is conserved along the geodesic due to existence of a time - like killing vector field",
    ". however @xmath140 is not a killing vector field and hence the momentum @xmath141 is not conserved .",
    "thus it is difficult to study neutrino oscillation under the equal momentum assumption in a curved spacetime . in this section",
    "we shall consider phase along the null line .",
    "hence the phase shift determining the oscillation could be given by , @xmath142 where @xmath38 .",
    "equation ( [ neul5 ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath143 the term @xmath144 in ( [ neul6 ] ) has been interpreted as the oscillation length @xmath145 ( which is actually defined by the proper distance as the phase shift @xmath146 changes by @xmath147 ) which is measured by the observer at rest at a position @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is being the local energy . as @xmath148 approaches to infinity , @xmath150 approaches the energy @xmath139 measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "thus the neutrino oscillation length in a black hole spacetime is given by following the metric ansatz ( [ neu9 ] ) as , @xmath151 while that for flat spacetime it reduces to , @xmath152 hence we can define an quantity which measures the fractional change in oscillation length due to presence of gravity , @xmath153 another quantity of interest is the shift in oscillation length due to these alternative theories compared with the vacuum schwarzschild solution in einstein general relativity and can be computed as , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the metric element for the alternative gravity theory and @xmath156 is the metric element for schwarzschild theory i.e. @xmath157 . next we shall calculate these quantities for the spherically symmetric solution used previously in this paper and hence put bounds on the parameters .",
    "we now consider proper oscillation length for neutrino oscillation in the vacuum solution for @xmath1 gravity .",
    "as pointed out in [ neuf1 ] the vacuum solution in @xmath1 gravity actually comes form @xmath158 and hence completely different from the usual vacuum solution in einstein theory for which @xmath159 .",
    "thus the vacuum solution in @xmath1 gravity has the same structure as ( a)ds - schwarzschild solution but is obtained from a @xmath160 lagrangian compared to @xmath84 in einstein theory and differ from the standard ( a)ds - schwarzschild solution in general relativity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities defined in equations ( [ neul9 ] ) and ( [ neul10 ] ) leads to the following expressions in this gravity theory , @xmath161 and , @xmath162 these two quantities are being plotted in figure [ fig1 ] , for the vacuum solution presented in this section . from the figures we observe that @xmath163 have the same asymptotic nature for all choice of parameters , which is also valid for @xmath164 .",

    "we have matched our result to flat and schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we have also shown quiet generally that the phase along null geodesic and time - like geodesic have a factor of @xmath2 in any general spherically symmetric spacetime .    in the last section we have presented the variation of oscillation length for introducing extra parameters in our theory in comparison with flat and schwarzschild spacetime . also from the difference in oscillation probability due to presence of alternative gravity",
    "can be used to constrain the parameters . for this purpose",
    "we have used data on neutrino flux as measured by different experiments and then put bounds on these parameters .",
    "the bounds on these parameters appear quiet small and hence not observed experimentally yet .",
    "the best bound on the parameter @xmath96 appearing in the vacuum solution for @xmath1 gravity is given from table-1 as @xmath240 .",

    "we have the best bound on @xmath242 as @xmath243 for sno phase ii neutrino oscillation data ( see table-3 ) .",
    "however these results are derived for two generation neutrino oscillation , also in sun only one type of neutrino is produced ( namely , the electron type ) and being of low energy we need not to consider all the three generations . in recent times",
    ", there have been many works concerning ultra high energy neutrino from agn and other energetic astrophysical sources in the universe .",
    "so it would be quiet natural to discuss three generation neutrino oscillation in gravitational field and apply the results of neutrino oscillation for these high energy neutrinos .",
    "since these neutrinos are generated in strong gravitational field , they may provide the behavior of gravity at such high field limit .",
    "we left these issues to be discuseed in some future work .",
    "also another interesting feature of this problem is the blueshift of neutrino phase .",
    "the oscillation length for any spherically symmetric spacetime is proportional to local energy , interpreted as neutrino climbing out of the gravitational potential well .",
    "however in this work we have used some solutions that are ads like on infinity thus decreasing the oscillation length .",
    "thus our result is valid for any spherically symmetric solution not only in four dimension but in any spacetime dimensions .",
    "also the constraints on the parameters are very interesting regarding their cosmological interpretation , which again makes neutrino oscillation in curved spacetime a very interesting and profound problem in physics .",
