    "<S> [ fig : tau_od](a ) , the inset shows that the slp remaining energy decays exponentially against time . </S>",
    "<S> the main plot displays the experimental observation that the slp decay time constant ( @xmath67 ) is linearly proportional to the od for slps ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such result is expected . as mentioned before </S>",
    "<S> , the slp decay is mainly due to broadening motion and leaking out of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> a larger od certainly reduces these decay effects and increases the slp surviving time . a longer slp surviving time </S>",
    "<S> is equivalent to a longer interaction time between the probe and switching pulses and , hence , results in a better switching efficiency as experimentally demonstrated by the circles in fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> we took the experimental data by fixing the od for the stored probe pulse ( @xmath42 ) and varying @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the slp duration was set to twice of @xmath67 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : tau_od](b ) is the theoretical prediction calculated from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2)-(11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the prediction and data is satisfactory except the data point at the smallest @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> a smaller phase mismatch ( @xmath40 ) at this @xmath37 causes the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the black line decreases as @xmath37 increases . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is more noticeable in the inset which covers @xmath37 up to 250 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath42 is kept the same and @xmath37 increases , the spatial profile of the stored probe pulse is unchanged and that of the stationary switching pulse becomes narrower in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the portion of the stored probe pulse that is affected by high switching intensity becomes less . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the switching less efficient . by setting @xmath42 equal to @xmath37 , the red line in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tau_od](b ) shows a constant slope . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the switching efficiency can be enhanced by the total od linearly .    </S>",
    "<S> one can increase the atomic density and shorten the medium length ( @xmath36 ) , e.g. cold atoms in an optical dipole trap or bose condensates , to keep od high and make the effect of phase mismatch ( @xmath40 ) negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this immediately improves the switching efficiency ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we can make @xmath68 , @xmath1 will be about 3 at the total od of 190 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the current scheme can be readily applied to the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) , i.e. the phase of a photon pulse modulated by another . while the probe attenuation is written as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) at @xmath69 ( switching detuning ) = 0 , the probe phase shift is given by @xmath70 @xcite . at @xmath71 and the optimum @xmath72 of @xmath73 , </S>",
    "<S> a single photon tightly focused to an area of around 100@xmath74 can induce a phase shift of the order of 0.01 radians which is certainly measurable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the single - photon xpm is not far from reality with the current scheme .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the switching is activated at 0.56 photons per atomic absorption cross section or the switching efficiency is 1.8 in the scheme of stored light switched by stationary light . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed the great potential of this scheme that the switching efficiency is not limited to the present result and can be further improved by increasing the od of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> our work advances the technology in low - light - level nonlinear optics and quantum information manipulation utilizing photons . </S>"
