    "the abundance of molecular gas in galaxies is set by the complex interplay of various formation and destruction processes operating in a highly turbulent medium .",
    "while many of the individual physical mechanisms are relatively well understood , such as the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust grains , its photo - dissociation by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons in the lyman - werner bands , or the importance of dust and @xmath0 self - shielding , e.g. , @xcite , we still lack a realistic and coherent picture that links together the formation of molecular gas , star formation , the turbulent , multi - phase structure of the ism , and the importance of the various feedback channels due to star formation .",
    "the molecular content of galaxies is a key diagnostic that provides insights not only into how galaxies evolve and grow their stellar component , but also helps to constrain the properties of the physical processes ( including feedback ) that operate in the ism .",
    "in addition , the modeling of the molecular ism provides a crucial theoretical background for the interpretation of molecular gas surveys , such as those expected in the near future with the atacama large millimeter / sub - millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "in addition to analytical and numerical models ( @xcite ) , empirical correlations inferred from observations of nearby galaxies are often used to predict the molecular gas abundance . in particular",
    ", the correlation between the surface density ratio of molecular and atomic ( @xmath1 ) hydrogen @xmath2 and the mid - plane pressure @xmath3 ( @xcite ) has been included in semi - analytical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) to estimate @xmath0 mass fractions of galaxies and their star formation rates , or in order to predict the global evolution of the @xmath0 baryon content in the universe @xcite .",
    "implicit in this approach is the assumption that the empirical correlation continues to hold for galaxies with ism properties that are potentially different from those found in galaxies in the local universe .",
    "it is clearly crucial to test this assumption , either observationally @xcite , or , as is the approach of this paper , with the help of numerical simulations that are based on a firm theoretical modeling of the microphysics of the ism .",
    "a further complication is the fact that @xmath0 masses and surface densities are typically not directly accessible to observations .",
    "the kinetic temperature ( @xmath4 k ) of the bulk of the molecular hydrogen in galaxies is too low , and the gas sufficiently shielded from uv radiation , to populate the excited levels of the rotational ladder at a significant level .",
    "hence , @xmath0 masses are often inferred from the emission of tracer elements and molecules . in particular ,",
    "the optically thick emission from the main isotope of carbon - monoxide ( co ) serves as a relatively reliable tracer of @xmath0 mass , at least under conditions typical of molecular clouds in the milky way .",
    "however , the conversion factor between @xmath5 luminosity and @xmath0 mass is expect to change systematically with the dust - to - gas ratio and with the strength of the interstellar radiation field",
    ". this effect needs to be included in the numerical modeling of empirical relations that are based on co observations .    in this paper",
    "we use numerical simulations of galaxies in a cosmological framework to study the origin of the @xmath6 relation and its dependence on the properties of the ism .",
    "our numerical models compute the local @xmath1 and @xmath0 abundances in the ism based on a chemical network of well understood formation and destruction processes . in addition , we compute the co emission expected from our model galaxies to account for variations of the @xmath7 conversion factor .",
    "we show that , under milky way like ism conditions , a @xmath6 relation similar to that seen in nearby galaxies arises rather naturally .",
    "we further show that galaxies with different dust - to - gas ratios and/or radiation fields also follow a @xmath6 relation , but with changes in the normalization and the slope .",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 abundances estimated from a @xmath6 relation are not robust if these changes are not taken into account .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sect : methods ] we describe the set - up of our numerical approach , discuss details of the data analysis , and introduce the observational data sets that we use to compare with our numerical models . in the subsequent section [ sect : results ] we present our numerical predictions for the @xmath6 relation and its dependence on environmental parameters .",
    "we also discuss the role of the @xmath5-@xmath0 conversion factor and present a physical model that captures many of the properties of the @xmath6 relation .",

    "we rely on the standard `` zoom - in '' method of embedding the lagrangian region of the halo into layers of lower dark matter resolution to reduce the overall computational cost , while capturing the large scale tidal fields correctly @xcite .",
    "the dark matter particle masses are @xmath21 @xmath18 h@xmath20 in the highest resolution region and increase by factors of 8 in subsequent lower resolution envelopes .",
    "the simulations start from cosmological initial conditions with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , and @xmath26 .",
    "one of our simulations is run fully self - consistently down to @xmath16 .",

    "the high - resolution lagrangian region harbors a large disk galaxy sitting in a halo of virial mass @xmath28 @xmath18 and several lower mass galaxies .",
    "we `` fix ism conditions '' ( see @xcite ) by imposing a spatially uniform dust - to - gas ratio that is independent of the gas metallicity .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio is a crucial parameter that affects the dust shielding and the formation rates of @xmath0 .",
    "it also enters the co emission model .",
    "we specify the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath9 in units of the dust - to - gas ratio in the solar neighborhood .",
    "furthermore , we fix the normalization of the radiation field at 1000  to @xmath29 = 10@xmath30 photons @xmath31 s@xmath20 sr@xmath20 ev@xmath20 , a value typical for the solar neighborhood in the milky way .",
    "we use the notation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the intensity of the radiation field at 1000  in units of @xmath29 .",
    "we stress that only the normalization of the radiation field is fixed .",
    "the shape of the radiation spectrum is not modified .",
    "all simulations include a photo - chemical network that follows the formation and destruction of molecular hydrogen in addition to the five major atomic and ionic species of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the simulations also include metal enrichment from supernova ( type ia and type ii ) , but no thermal energy injection , optically thin radiative cooling by hydrogen ( including @xmath0 ) , helium , and metal lines , and 3d radiative transfer of ionizing and non - ionizing uv radiation from stellar sources in the optically thin variable eddington tensor ( otvet ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the details of the implementation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compute the emission arising from the @xmath34 rotational transition of the @xmath35 isotope in a post - processing step as described in @xcite . in brief , the co abundance in each simulation grid cell is computed based on the results of a suite of small scale magneto - hydrodynamical ism simulations @xcite .",
    "the emission is then computed using the escape probability formalism and assuming a virial scaling of the @xmath5 line width .",
    "the contributions from these individual , @xmath36 pc sized resolution elements are then combined in the optically thin limit to derive the co emission from larger regions .",
    "the @xmath5 brightness temperature is a free parameter of the model .",
    "we adopt an excitation temperature of 10 k ( approximately the kinetic temperature of molecular clouds in the milky way ) and a corresponding brightness temperature against the cmb background of 6.65 k.    an overview of the set of the analyzed simulation snapshots is given in table [ tab : sims ] .",
    "the ism pressure in the mid - plane of a disk galaxy is not easily accessible to observations . in order to arrive at an estimate , disk galaxies",
    "are often modeled as self - gravitating two - component disks , consisting of a turbulent gas layer and a stellar disk , in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "if these assumptions are made , the mid - plane pressure can be expressed in terms of the gas and stellar surface densities ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and the velocity dispersions of the gas and stellar disk ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) : @xmath42 the velocity dispersions can be computed for virialized disks and equation ( [ eq : pext1 ] ) can be rewritten using the scale heights @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the gas and stellar disks @xcite : @xmath45.\\ ] ] in this paper we follow blitz & rosolowski and adopt equation ( [ eq : pext2 ] ) , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 as the independent variables .",
    "in addition , we adopt their choice @xmath46 km s@xmath20 .",
    "we also decided to fix the values of the gaseous and stellar scale heights to @xmath47 pc and @xmath48 pc , typical of disk galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this is done , because in our simulations the disk scale heights are , at best , only marginally resolved . however , since the scale heights enter ( [ eq : pext2 ] ) in form of a square root , none of our results change significantly if the scale heights are varied within reasonably bounds .",
    "@xmath0 masses and surface densities are often derived from @xmath5 observations using the galactic @xmath5-@xmath0 conversion factor .",
    "its numerical value has been determined to within a factor of two by a number of independent techniques ( e.g. , ) and a commonly adopted value is @xmath49 @xmath31 k@xmath20 km@xmath20 s ( without he ) , or , equivalently , @xmath50 @xmath18 pc@xmath51",
    "k@xmath20 km@xmath20 s ( including he ) .",
    "in order to assess the importance of potential conversion factor variations , we compute in two different ways the @xmath0 surface density that enters the neutral gas surface density @xmath52 ( including he ) and the surface density ratio @xmath53 the first method takes the @xmath0 surface density directly as predicted by the chemical network in the simulation .",
    "alternatively , we use the @xmath5 emission predicted by our @xmath5 model ( see section [ sect : sims ] ) and convert it into an @xmath0 surface density using the galactic conversion factor . in general , this has three effects if the actual conversion factor differs from the adopted galactic value : ( 1 ) it changes the minimum @xmath0 surface density that is detectable , ( 2 ) it changes the estimate of @xmath3 via the change in @xmath38 , and ( 3 ) it changes @xmath37 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ [ limitations ] ] limitations : + + + + + + + + + + + +    as pointed out , the model predicts the scaling @xmath54 in the @xmath0 dominated regime with @xmath55 if the galaxy is gas dominated . yet , while many of the observations have a slope consistent with this prediction , some have a significantly larger slope of about unity .",
    "in addition , the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fitobs ] reveals that the slope becomes smaller if the uv field is increased and that it becomes larger as the dust - to - gas ratio is decreased .",
    "how do we explain these trends ?",
    "formally , a value @xmath56 close to zero could explain a slope @xmath57 in some observed galaxies .",
    "however , using the @xcite data we find that @xmath56 lies in the range @xmath58 for most galaxies in their sample .",
    "we would thus expect slopes only in the range @xmath59 .",
    "instead , the answer is that in those galaxies the @xmath1 surface density starts to _ decrease _ with increasing @xmath38 at large values of the neutral gas surface density .",
    "note that such a decrease is not present in the model , which instead predicts a monotonic increase of @xmath60 with @xmath38 , see ( [ eq : modelsigmas ] ) . however , a drop of @xmath60 with increasing @xmath38 has been observed before , particularly in centers of galaxies @xcite although its origin remains unknown .",
    "the decrease of @xmath60 with @xmath38 boosts the increase of @xmath37 with @xmath3 and leads to a steeper slope .",
    "the trend of a decreasing slope with increasing @xmath33 appears to be driven largely by the scatter in @xmath60 at a given @xmath38 .",
    "specifically , plotting @xmath60 vs @xmath38 reveals that while @xmath60 does not exceeds its saturation limit , it does frequently lie below it .",
    "this downward - only scatter can be as large as  1 dex at @xmath61 @xmath18 pc@xmath51 and gradually decreases with increasing @xmath38 out to large surface densities ( @xmath62 @xmath18 pc@xmath51 ) .",
    "this change in the scatter leads to an overall increase in the median @xmath60 with @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , @xmath37 increases less quickly with @xmath3 and , hence , a reduced slope is obtained , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fit2 ] .",
    "finally , the increase in the @xmath1 saturation limit with decreasing dust - to - gas ratio leads to the anti - correlation between slope and @xmath63 .",
    "when the dust - to - gas ratio is decreased , a higher gas surface density and , hence , @xmath3 needs to be reached in order to fully convert the gas from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , a significant fraction of the ism regions with @xmath64 above the detection threshold contain a large , or even a dominating , contribution of @xmath1 and @xmath65 is often not fulfilled .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit2 ] which shows that cells above the truncation limit can have @xmath0 to @xmath1 ratios as small as 1% .",
    "the figure also shows that @xmath37 has a much steeper .",
    "the surface densities of the star formation rate scales super - linearly with @xmath38 near the so - called threshold of the kennicut - schmidt relation @xcite . in this regime",
    "the atomic hydrogen is not yet fully saturated and often @xmath66 . since @xmath67 @xcite , @xmath64 and , thus , @xmath37 scale super - linearly with @xmath38 in this regime .",
    "hence , @xmath37 will also scale super - linearly with @xmath3 . ]",
    "dependence on @xmath3 in the @xmath1 dominated regime ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "hence , including data points that follow this steeper dependence will bias the fit high .",
    "a possible solution to avoid this problem is to restrict the fit to data that falls either only in the @xmath0 or in the @xmath1 dominated regime .",
    "we studied the relation between mid - plane pressure and the @xmath68 ratio in a set of hydrodynamical simulations that follow explicitly the formation and destruction of molecular hydrogen in the ism .",
    "we have demonstrated that these simulation predict a @xmath69 relation that is very similar to the one observed in nearby galaxies .",
    "the fact that the relation changes systematically with the dust - to - gas ratio and the strength of the uv radiation field in the ism indicates that the @xmath69 relation should not be used as a universal tool to estimate @xmath0 abundances in galaxies with ism conditions different from those in the milky way . in particular , we find that the normalization of the @xmath70 relation decreases with a decreasing dust - to - gas ratio @xmath63 .",
    "the scaling of the normalization is @xmath71 as long as the ism regions that are included in fitting the @xmath70 relation are predominantly molecular and the metallicity dependence of the @xmath5-@xmath0 conversion factor is taken into account .",
    "we have proposed a simple model that is based on the numerical study of the @xmath1 to @xmath0 transition that captures many of the basic properties of the @xmath69 relation .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath69 relation in hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disk galaxies .",
    "while their numerical approach differs in detail , they also find a clear correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath37 with a slope @xmath72 .",
    "although most ism regions included in their analysis probe the @xmath1 dominated regime , their largest galaxy reaches pressures high enough to study the @xmath69 relation in molecular hydrogen dominated gas .",
    "interestingly , while our numerical modeling predicts a change in the slope of the relation from @xmath73 for @xmath74 to @xmath75 for @xmath76 , such a change is not immediately apparent in the work by @xcite .",
    "as showed in the preceding section , a slope of @xmath77 in the @xmath0 dominated regime is a direct consequence of a fixed @xmath1 saturation limit .",
    "hence , the relatively steep slope ( @xmath78 ) found by @xcite in the @xmath0 dominated regime might indicate that in their numerical model @xmath60 decreases with increasing @xmath38 at large gas surface densities .",
    "@xcite studied the origin of the relation between @xmath0 abundance and mid - plane pressure analytically .",
    "he found that in the @xmath1 dominated regime @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the local radiation field .",
    "while this relation is sometimes used to `` explain '' the @xmath69 relation , we stress that the @xmath1 dominated regime is not the regime typically studied in observations .",
    "furthermore , @xmath80 , the interstellar radiation field incident on the clouds in the ism , is likely highly spatially variable and will correlate only to a certain degree with galactic properties smoothed over @xmath81kpc scales .",
    "this implies that applying this formula properly is non - trivial .",
    "for instance , if the @xmath81kpc scale uv radiation field is approximately constant a naive application of elmegreen s formula predicts @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast , the model presented in section [ sect : model ] predicts @xmath83 for @xmath66 , which results in a scaling @xmath84 ( for @xmath85 ) close to observations @xcite .",
    "the numerical predictions presented in this paper are based on the modeling of a variety of well understood physical processes in the ism . however , it is possible or even likely that we are missing processes that have an impact on the atomic and molecular hydrogen abundance in galaxies .",
    "for instance , while the simulations include certain aspects of stellar feedback ( e.g. , ionizing and dissociating radiation from massive stars , metal enrichment from supernovae , stellar mass loss ) , they miss others ( e.g. , radiation pressure , thermal feedback from supernovae , stellar winds ) .",
    "also , the resolution of the simulations is too coarse to resolve individual molecular clouds and the detailed dynamics and small scale chemistry that takes place within them .",
    "hence , it will be important to verify the predictions of our numerical models observationally .",
    "important tests include ( i ) the measurement of the normalization of the @xmath70 relation in galaxies with low metallicities and presumably low dust - to - gas ratios , ( ii ) the measurement of the slope of the relation in both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 dominated region , and ( iii ) to check for correlations of the normalization and slope with the scaling exponent between the stellar surface density and the gas surface density .",
