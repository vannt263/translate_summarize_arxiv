    "the studies of the vast amount of inclusive electron scattering world data have shown the existence of @xmath2-scaling  @xcite and superscaling ( based on @xmath3-scaling variable ) ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) phenomena . a very weak dependence of the reduced cross section on the momentum transfer @xmath4 ( scaling of the first kind ) has been observed at excitation energies below the quasielastic peak for large enough @xmath4 .",
    "scaling of the second kind ( _ i.e. _  no dependence of the reduced cross section on the mass number ) has been found to be excellent in the same region .",
    "when both types of scaling occur one says that the reduced cross sections exhibit superscaling .",
    "it has been shown ( _ e.g. _ , in  @xcite ) that the superscaling phenomenon is related to the specific high - momentum tail of the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath5 at momenta @xmath6  @xmath7 which is similar for all nuclei and is due to the short - range and tensor correlations in the nuclear medium .",
    "it has been observed also that above the qe peak the scaling of the second kind is good , but scaling of the first kind is violated .",
    "the latter occurs due to the excitation of a nucleon in the nucleus to a delta - resonance which subsequently decays into a nucleon and a pion ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , meson exchange currents are known to violate the scaling behavior  @xcite , although their effects appear not to be the dominant ones  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    "the theoretical concept of superscaling has been introduced within the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model . as pointed out in  @xcite , however , the actual dynamical physical reason of the superscaling is more complex than that provided by the rfg model .",
    "for instance , the qe scaling function in the rfg model is @xmath8 for @xmath9 , whereas the experimental scaling function @xmath10 extends to large negative values of @xmath11 up to @xmath12 in the data for @xmath13 processes .",
    "thus , the necessity to consider the superscaling in theoretical methods which go beyond the rfg model has arisen .",
    "one of them is the coherent density fluctuation model ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) being a natural extension of the fermi gas case to realistic finite nuclear systems . as pointed out in  @xcite , in the cdfm both basic quantities , density and momentum distributions",
    "are responsible for the scaling and superscaling behavior in nuclei .",
    "the qe scaling function in the cdfm @xmath14 agrees with the available experimental data for @xmath15 , including @xmath16 .    in  @xcite the superscaling analyses of the electron scattering for energies of several hundred mev to a few gev",
    "have been extended to include not only qe processes but also those in which @xmath17-excitation dominates . both qe- and @xmath18-region scaling functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been deduced in  @xcite from phenomenological fits to the data for electron - nuclei scattering cross sections .",
    "generally , the theoretical microscopical construction of the scaling function should take into account final - state interactions ( fsi ) . by using a relativistic mean field for the final states , in  @xcite",
    "a scaling function with asymmetric shape has been obtained being in agreement with the experimental scaling function .",
    "also an asymmetrical scaling function in accordance with data has been obtained recently  @xcite within a semi - relativistic approach , based on improved non - relativistic expansions , but with fsi described with the dirac equation - based potential . the asymmetry of the qe scaling function in the cdfm has been introduced in a phenomenological way  @xcite accounting for the role of fsi .",
    "the analyses of the superscaling phenomenon and the present knowledge of inclusive electron scattering off nuclei have induced studies of neutrino scattering from nuclei on the same basis .",
    "this makes it possible to explore fundamental questions of neutrino reactions and neutrino oscillations in relation to hypothesis of nonzero neutrino masses  @xcite . in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) the scaling ideas have been inverted : given the scaling functions one can just multiply by the elementary charge - changing neutrino cross sections to obtain corresponding cc neutrino and antineutrino cross sections on nuclei for intermediate to high energies in the same region of excitation . in  @xcite the scaling and superscaling ideas have been carried a step further to include neutral current neutrino and antineutrino scattering cross sections for scattering from @xmath0c , namely for reactions @xmath0c(@xmath21x , @xmath0c(@xmath22x involving proton knockout and @xmath0c(@xmath23x , @xmath0c(@xmath24x involving neutron knockout in the qe regime .",
    "a number of other theoretical considerations ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) have been devoted to studies of both neutral- ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) and charge - changing ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) neutrino - nucleus scattering .    in  @xcite the qe- and @xmath18-region scaling functions obtained in the cdfm and within the modified parameter - free theoretical approach  @xcite based on the light - front dynamics method ( lfd ) ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) have been applied to describe the experimental data on differential cross sections of qe inclusive electron scattering as well as to analyze charge - changing neutrino scattering on the @xmath0c nucleus for energies of the incident particles from 1 to 2  gev .",
    "it has been shown that the results for electron scattering on @xmath0c are close to those of the superscaling analysis  @xcite and are quite different from the rfg results , whereas the almost symmetric cdfm scaling function leads to cross sections that are similar to the results of the rfg model .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the application of the cdfm scaling function to calculations of neutral current neutrino and antineutrino scattering cross sections from nuclei , _",
    "e.g. _ to consider reactions on @xmath0c as those in  @xcite and mentioned above with proton and neutron knockout in the qe region .",
    "we should note that , as it has been considered in  @xcite , when one has an incident lepton , a scattering with exchange of a @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 and the scattered lepton ( _ i.e. _ a charged lepton ) is detected , the @xmath28-channel exchange of the corresponding boson is controlled .",
    "when , however , the scattered lepton is a ( not detected ) neutrino or antineutrino , and a knocked - out nucleon is detected , then the kinematics of the @xmath1-channel are controlled .",
    "we also follow  @xcite on the formalism for cross sections and , what is more crucial , in what concerns the scaling ideas that interrelate the @xmath28- and @xmath1-channel processes .",

    "assuming that the domains of integration @xmath55 ( in the @xmath1-channel ) and @xmath56 ( in the @xmath28-channel ) are the same or very similar , the results for the scaling function obtained in the case of inclusive electron scattering ( where @xmath57 works ) can be used in the case of nc neutrino reactions .",

    "third , it can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig2ant][fig5ant ] that , similarly to the results in  @xcite , the shapes of the cross sections for proton and neutron knockout are very similar .",
    "however , the magnitudes are somewhat different .",
    "for instance , the magnitude of the maximum of the nc cross section of neutrino scattering is much larger than that for antineutrino scattering cross section .",

    "fourth , except for antineutrinos at forward angles , the neutron knockout results are 3050% higher than the proton knockout . as noted in  @xcite , this occurs because ( in absence of strangeness ) both the vector and the axial - vector contributions are larger for neutrons than for protons , and they sum up .",

    "we adopt the @xmath1- versus @xmath28-channel scaling criteria of  @xcite to apply the cdfm scaling functions to @xmath1-channel scattering at intermediate - to - high energies .",

    "neutrino and antineutrino cross sections come closer , diminishing the above ratio . at forward scattering angles",
    "the @xmath140 cross sections are strongly suppressed ( by an order of magnitude or more ) .",
    "this is observed for both proton and neutron knockout .",
    "moreover , the neutron knockout cross sections are somewhat larger than the proton knockout cross sections due to the behavior of the nc single - nucleon form factors .",

    "( [ new15 ] ) ) leads to a sharper slope of the cross sections , in comparison to that with the parabolic form ( by using eq .",
    "( [ new24 ] ) ) , for the values of the kinetic energy @xmath129 of the knocked - out nucleon smaller than those in the maximum of the cross section .    in summary",
    ", we applied the superscaling approach by means of the scaling function obtained within the cdfm ( and used previously  @xcite for the electron and cc neutrino reactions ) to the nc neutrino ( antineutrino ) scattering in the qe region at energy of 1  gev from the @xmath0c nucleus .",
