    "it is now widely recognized that features in the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies can be a gold mine of information for cosmology .",
    "a great deal of experimental effort is being expended in order to map the cmb accurately over a wide range of angular scales from the ground , balloons and eventually space .",
    "in addition to providing valuable information about the cosmological parameters , it is becoming clear that the cmb can teach us much about how the fluctuations were generated in the early universe .",
    "for example in @xcite , it was claimed that by studying the acoustic signature of the anisotropy spectrum one can test the inflationary paradigm for fluctuation generation ( see @xcite and references therein for other inflationary tests ) .",
    "the key idea in differentiating inflation from other models of structure formation , such as defects @xcite , is the behavior of the gravitational potential fluctuations outside the horizon . in inflation , these potentials are approximately constant while in a viable defect model , or indeed any isocurvature model , they start out vanishingly small and are generated as a mode enters the horizon . coupled with the effects of photon backreaction , this distinction implies a different structure in the anisotropy spectrum on small angular scales , allowing for a test of the inflationary paradigm .",
    "specifically it was claimed that , with some exotic exceptions , isocurvature models produced spectra whose peaks were phase shifted with respect to the inflationary models @xcite . in a very rough sense ,",
    "the inflationary driving force excites a cosine mode whereas the isocurvature one excites a sine mode .",
    "even if the phase shift were closer to @xmath0 rather than @xmath1 radians @xcite , causing the peaks to line up with the inflationary model once again , the non - monotonic modulation of the peak heights by baryon drag would allow the defect and inflationary spectra to be distinguished .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details .    in this paper",
    ", we specialize the discussion to causal _ scaling _ models by applying turok s @xcite mode expansion techniques to the underlying stress perturbations .",
    "these fluctuations are the fundamental source of gravitational instability in any isocurvature model @xcite .",
    "detailed discussions of stress perturbations , conservation laws , and gauge in relativistic perturbation theory as well as their role in causality arguments are given in the appendices [ sec - perturbation ] and [ sec - causal ] respectively .",
    "we explicitly enforce energy - momentum conservation and thus self - consistently include the response and backreaction of the photon - baryon fluid to the gravitational sources @xcite . we show that except for one special case , the resultant cmb spectra are easily distinguished from their inflationary counterpart .",
    "if the dynamical effects of isotropic and anisotropic stress are exactly balanced , a novel situation may arise in which the sense of gravity is reversed and hence also the predictions for the acoustic features in the cmb .",
    "we discuss in detail the model of turok @xcite which utilizes this mechanism in appendix [ sec - mimic ] .",
    "thus out of the general class of causal models with scaling properties only this one case may be confused with inflation from its acoustic signature .",
    "let us assume that the fluctuations which eventually form large scale structure in the universe are generated causally from an initially homogeneous and isotropic friedman - robertson - walker universe .",
    "causality , together with energy and momentum conservation , places strong constraints on the manner in which this can occur .",
    "heuristically , energy conservation implies that changes in the energy density at any location arise only by its `` flow '' across surfaces . in general",
    ", these flows must obey momentum conservation and hence only arise from stress variations in the matter , e.g.  for a perfect fluid from gradients in the pressure .",
    "it instructive first to consider the simple case of a non - relativistic fluid .",
    "we shall then show how these arguments manifest themselves in relativistic perturbation theory with a more general stress - energy tensor for the matter .      here",
    "we first examine the evolution of perturbations in a simple non - relativistic fluid , perhaps with viscosity , but ignoring gravitational effects .",
    "energy - momentum conservation for the perturbations is described by the linearized continuity and euler fluid equations @xmath2 where summation is implicit , @xmath3 is the density fluctuation , @xmath4 is the bulk velocity , @xmath5 is the pressure , and @xmath6 is the viscous or anisotropic stress tensor .",
    "density fluctuations can only be generated by fluid flows .",
    "a fourier decomposition of the perturbation implies that compared with velocities , the density must be suppressed by a factor of @xmath7 at long wavelengths",
    ". however momentum conservation constrains the form of such flows : they can not be present initially and thus must be generated by pressure gradients .",
    "the fourier decomposition shows that velocities should be suppressed with respect to pressure fluctuations by a factor of @xmath7 at long wavelengths .",
    "hence density fluctuations generically scale as @xmath8 times the pressure fluctuations in a fluid or @xmath9 in the power spectrum .",
    "this is the familiar result that causal flows of matter will establish a @xmath9 density spectrum even when no density perturbations exist initially @xcite .",
    "the poisson equation implies that the resultant potential fluctuations scale as the pressure itself . in a relativistic context ,",
    "potential fluctuations are equivalent to curvature fluctuations in the spatial metric .",
    "the fact that the generator of density and curvature fluctuations is causal requires that initially they must vanish .",
    "hence we refer to such models for fluctuation generation as _ isocurvature _ models .",
    "the form of the pressure perturbation itself is not arbitrary .",
    "in fact , if the pressure perturbations are adiabatic @xmath10 , then energy - momentum conservation requires @xmath11 and fixes @xmath12 , so that it can not generate density perturbations .",
    "thus it is only the non - adiabatic pressure or `` entropy '' perturbation that can causally produce density fluctuations @xcite @xmath13 in general , there are many possible sources of non - adiabatic pressure , but causality constrains their behavior by requiring that their fluctuations be uncorrelated outside the horizon .",
    "one natural way to obtain them is to assume the fluid is composed of a sum over @xmath14 particle constituents . in this case ,",
    "@xmath15,\\ ] ] so that if the sound speed @xmath16 in the components does not equal the total sound speed , i.e.  the equation of state for the components differ , then the initial condition @xmath17 implies that non - adiabatic pressure perturbations _ must _ be generated . in the cosmological setting , concrete examples of this mechanism include the baryon and axion isocurvature models as well as cosmological defect scenarios .",
    "this idea , that density fluctuations may be balanced to satisfy total energy - momentum conservation , is conventionally referred to as _ compensation_. compensation once established initially is maintained by energy - momentum conservation ; there is no need to enforce it by hand as often done in the literature @xcite .",
    "now let us consider the anisotropic stress .",
    "internal friction or viscosity is generated when there is relative motion between various parts of the fluid .",
    "the anisotropic stress tensor thus scales as the spatial derivatives of the velocity field and to lowest order , the first derivative ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . by momentum conservation , we know that the velocity field vanishes initially .",
    "hence anisotropic stress is only generated after pressure gradients set up bulk motion .",
    "the scaling in @xmath7-space is that of @xmath7 times the velocity fluctuation or @xmath8 times the pressure fluctuations .",
    "the euler equation thus implies that _ at large scales _ the generation of bulk velocities and hence density and potential fluctuations through anisotropic stress is subdominant .",
    "this simple example shows that the energy - momentum conservation equations automatically build in causal behavior .",
    "the problem of considering the effects of causality thus reduces to the establishment of causal initial conditions and the enforcement of energy - momentum conservation as the universe evolves under the stresses of the matter .",
    "two issues complicate the simple picture of the last section .",
    "the first is that we must possess a model for how the stress perturbations evolve .",
    "we shall return to consider causal constraints on their behavior in the next section .",
    "the second is that in relativistic perturbation theory , the stress - energy tensor of the matter is _ covariantly _ conserved .",
    "hence the continuity and euler relations of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : simplefluid ] ) become @xmath18 because metric terms enter these equations , the form that the causal constraint takes depends on the metric representation , i.e.  the gauge . for example , the continuity equation is altered by changes in the spatial metric .",
    "the simplest example is that of the stretching of space due to the background expansion , which dilutes the number density of particles in physical space .",
    "likewise perturbations to the spatial metric cause similar effects to the density perturbation . to disentangle metric effects on the generation of perturbations from the truly causal evolution by flows ,",
    "it is desirable to find a representation of perturbations that obeys an ordinary conservation law . in this context",
    ", two quantities have been often discussed in the literature : the stress - energy pseudo - tensor @xmath19 @xcite and the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath20 @xcite .    to understand the problem",
    ", it is perhaps useful to recall first the issue of gauge choice . in relativistic perturbation theory",
    ", one has the freedom to choose which spatial surface , and what coordinate system on this surface , to use in defining the perturbations .",
    "gauge freedom can be both a complicating annoyance and a very convenient tool , but poses no real obstacle for applying relativistic perturbation theory .",
    "once the initial conditions are properly established , covariant conservation of the stress - energy tensor properly and causally evolves the fluctuations in any gauge .",
    "in particular , all gauges will agree on _ physical observables _",
    ", e.g.  cmb anisotropies .",
    "three gauges choices , for which we give detailed properties in appendix [ sec - perturbation ] , are in common use .",
    "let us briefly note here their benefits and drawbacks before specializing the discussion to the relativistic analogue of the initial conditions described in the previous section .",
    "perhaps the most popular gauge choice is that of synchronous gauge , where the perturbations appear only in the space - space part of the metric ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this gauge",
    ", the spatial hypersurfaces on which one defines the perturbations are orthogonal to constant - time hypersurfaces and proper time corresponds to coordinate time .",
    "thus this coordinate system is natural for freely - falling observers or cold dark matter particles .",
    "the drawback of this gauge is that the density perturbations are not easily related to the observable anisotropy and the gravitational sector is non - intuitive",
    ". one must be careful to compute observables as the individual components of this gauge can be quite misleading .    the most familiar gauge from courses in relativity is the conformal newtonian gauge . in this gauge ,",
    "the metric is diagonal : the space - space part gives the curvature perturbation , and the time - time part the gravitational potential .",
    "this gauge has been frequently used in analytic work on cmb anisotropies because the representation of the gravitational ( sachs - wolfe ) effects is simple and the density perturbations correspond closely to the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the gauge can be difficult to work with numerically , and extreme care must be taken with the initial conditions .    for work involving causality , the obvious gauge choice is the comoving gauge , also known as the total - matter gauge and velocity - orthogonal isotropic gauge .",
    "this gauge is difficult to conceptualize , since it contains an off - diagonal time - space perturbation .",
    "however as we shall show in appendix [ sec - causal ] , the spurious effects of density dilution ( from stretching of the spatial metric ) which complicate the analysis of the conservation laws are absent in this gauge .",
    "more specifically , the curvature perturbation @xmath20 in this gauge ( superscript @xmath21 ) is generated only by pressure ( non - adiabatic if the curvature vanishes initially ) and anisotropic stress fluctuations @xmath0 ( see eq .  ( [ eqn : zetadot ] ) , definitions in  [ ss - comoving ] , and @xcite for anisotropic stress terms in the relativistic fluid context ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the scale factor and temporal derivatives are hereafter with respect to conformal time @xmath24 . in the case of a more general stress - energy tensor",
    ", we can merely replace @xmath25 and @xmath0 by the isotropic and anisotropic scalar components of @xmath26 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stressenergy ] ) ] .",
    "the direct dependence of the curvature on stress perturbations implies that the causality argument in this gauge is the most similar to the non - relativistic case discussed in the previous section .",
    "for example , in the absence of these stresses , e.g.  in the inflationary example with adiabatic fluctuations , the curvature is simply constant outside the horizon to leading order @xcite .",
    "thus the proper generalization of the causal argument to the relativistic context is that the curvature on the comoving hypersurfaces @xmath20 vanishes initially and is only generated by the causal motion of matter ( see @xcite and appendix [ sec - causal ] ) .    from this condition",
    ", it is simple to reconstruct the causal constraint in the two other gauges from gauge transformations ( see  [ ss - initial ] ) .",
    "the curvature on newtonian hypersurfaces is directly proportional to the density fluctuations on the comoving hypersurfaces [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : poissontmg ] ) ] .",
    "this suggests that the isocurvature condition for the total matter gauge is the same as that of the newtonian gauge .",
    "we show in appendix [ sec - causal ] that this intuition is correct , up to an irrelevant decaying mode [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : decaying ] ) ] , if the equation of state is constant . for the synchronous gauge , the condition that @xmath27 is identical to the assumption that the pseudo - energy @xmath28 and the pseudo - momentum density @xmath29 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pseudose ] ) vanishes initially @xcite .",
    "these are components of the stress - energy pseudo - tensor commonly employed in the literature , which likewise obeys an ordinary conservation condition @xmath30 as one would expect .",
    "thus these three sets of initial conditions : vanishing of the comoving curvature @xmath20 , newtonian curvature @xmath31 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , are essentially equivalent .",
    "once these conditions are established , energy - momentum conservation causally evolves the perturbations under the influence of spatial stresses , generating properties such as a @xmath9 scaling in the power spectrum of the pseudo - energy and comoving density perturbation .",
    "let us now turn to the question of causal stress evolution .",
    "causality implies that no measurable quantity , e.g.  the fields and stress - energy components , can have superhorizon scale correlations .",
    "this implies that their power spectrum behaves as `` white noise '' , @xmath32 to leading order for @xmath33 , unless other symmetries exist to eliminate even this contribution ( e.g.  energy - momentum conservation and the comoving density perturbation , see also  [ ss - stress ] ) . in appendix",
    "[ sec - causal ] , we show that for models with scalar fields , this constraint limits the superhorizon scale behavior of all of the stresses : the isotropic stress @xmath34 behaves as @xmath32 and the anisotropic stresses , which depend only on spatial derivatives of fields , behaves as @xmath8 for @xmath33 .",
    "turok @xcite raises the interesting question of what general statements for the cmb anisotropy spectrum can be made if one combines causality with the _ scaling ansatz_. the scaling ansatz is a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics and predictions of defect models @xcite .",
    "it implies that defect networks have only one characteristic scale , set by the current horizon size .",
    "thus , for example , a string network a few thousand years after the big bang has the same correlations as a string network a nanosecond after the big bang .",
    "this scaling ansatz has been useful for studying the dynamics of the non - linear sigma model , a simple approximation to defect dynamics , that has scaling solutions in both the matter and radiation dominated epochs@xcite .    for our purposes , scaling may be defined more phenomenologically as the assumption that the power ( per @xmath35 ) in the metric fluctuations , i.e.  in the newtonian curvature fluctuation @xmath36 , and potential fluctuation @xmath37 are both the same on each scale at horizon crossing @xmath38 and evolve in a self - similar fashion @xmath39 the newtonian potential and curvature perturbations along with their evolution are directly related to the gravitational redshifts experienced by a photon @xcite .",
    "thus _ any _ model which can explain the flatness of the large angle cmb spectrum seen by _ cobe _",
    "@xcite must also obey the scaling ansatz at least approximately .",
    "the inflationary scenario naturally generates such fluctuations with @xmath40 constant .",
    "we must now seek a causal mechanism for their generation through stress perturbations .",
    "the ansatz can not simply be imposed on the metric fluctuations since this does not guarantee that a consistent solution of the conservation and einstein - poisson equations exist .",
    "consider first the newtonian curvature @xmath31 . from the arguments of  [ ss - example ] &",
    " [ ss - relativistic ] , made rigorous by the gauge considerations of the appendices [ sec - perturbation ] and [ sec - causal ] , a pressure fluctuation source @xmath34 generates a comoving gauge density perturbation ( superscript @xmath21 ) of order @xmath41 and hence from the newtonian poisson equation ( [ eqn : poissontmg ] ) @xmath42 for white noise pressure perturbations , the scaling ansatz eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scaling ] ) then requires @xmath43 for @xmath33 .",
    "thus if we adopt this ansatz for the pressure source , energy - momentum conservation will naturally generate scaling behavior in @xmath31 .",
    "note also that white noise pressure perturbations imply white noise curvature fluctuations .",
    "turok @xcite points out that to study possible behaviors around and after horizon crossing , we can decompose the source into basis functions that satisfy scaling and a strict lack of correlations outside the horizon @xmath44 for which in real space @xmath45 the symmetry in @xmath46 implies that a diagonal basis exists where @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "however , for illustrative purposes , we follow turok in employing @xmath48 as a convenient basis , where @xmath49 .",
    "we shall therefore adopt in the next section pressure sources of the form @xmath50 which differs from turok s suggestion of @xmath51 ( see also appendix [ sec - mimic ] ) .",
    "our assumption follows from scaling and causal constraints on stresses and allows the density evolution to be naturally determined by energy - momentum conservation from the source stresses .",
    "now let us consider the newtonian gravitational potential [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : poissonnewt ] ) ] , @xmath52 thus the scaling ansatz for @xmath31 holds equally well for @xmath53 except in the presence of anisotropic stress contributions @xmath54 . to produce a flat cmb anisotropy spectrum ,",
    "any such contributions must also obey a scaling relation @xmath55 if the universe is isotropic initially , anisotropic stress like the comoving density perturbation can only be generated by causal motion of matter implying a @xmath8 scaling for @xmath33 ( see  [ ss - example ] for an example ) .",
    "the same arguments employed in deriving the general form of the causal pressure source imply ( see @xcite for an analogous derivation ) @xmath56 , \\label{eqn : basispi}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and we have normalized the function to behave as @xmath58 on small scales .",
    "thus eq .  ( [ eqn : basis ] ) and ( [ eqn : basispi ] ) represent the mode decompositions of a scaling isotropic and anisotropic stress perturbation which strictly obeys causal constraints for a lack of correlations above the horizon .",
    "let us first review the formalism set up in @xcite for calculating the acoustic oscillations in the cmb for a model with external gravitational sources . to avoid obscuring the main physical points , we have relegated the technical details to the appendices [ sec - perturbation ] and [ sec - causal ] .",
    "the basic idea is that one solves the equations for the fluid and metric evolution under the influence of sources which are assumed to interact with the fluids only through gravity . for cmb studies , it is convenient to choose a newtonian gauge condition to represent these effects , since the perturbations are more easily interpreted in this gauge than in the synchronous or comoving gauge .",
    "the einstein equations tell us that the matter fields generate newtonian metric perturbations : specifically the curvature @xmath31 and gravitational potential @xmath53 .    under the methods of @xcite ,",
    "the gravitational contributions of the photon - baryon fluid are separated from the other sources , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the photon - baryon oscillator equation is then solved in the presence of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "if we assume that the source is composed of seeds , i.e.  a component whose stress - energy tensor makes a small perturbation to the background , its contribution is [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : stressenergy ] ) and ( [ eqn : conserve ] ) ] @xmath63 where we have simply labeled the scalar terms of the stress - energy tensor of the seeds in the fluid convention without loss of generality , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . ]",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stressenergy ] ) ] .",
    "thus since defect seeds merely represent a special case of an external source , they may easily be treated under this formalism .    to summarize the results of @xcite",
    ", it was established that isocurvature initial conditions , in the sense of  [ ss - relativistic ] and appendix [ sec - causal ] , robustly predict an anticorrelation between the source curvature and cmb temperature perturbations at horizon crossing during radiation domination .",
    "the underlying reason is obvious from the causal arguments of  [ sec - conservation ] : changes in the source energy density must be compensated by an opposing change in the radiation density before bulk motion has had a chance to redistribute the matter . since correlations and anticorrelations with the curvature represent compressions and rarefactions in potential wells respectively under normal conditions , the acoustic signature can distinguish between these cases ( see  [ ss - assumptions ] and appendix [ sec - mimic ] for exceptions ) .",
    "the specific signature is provided by the drag baryons induce on the photon - baryon fluid which enhances compressions over rarefactions .",
    "thus the signature of an inflationary model is given by the ratio of the acoustic peak locations , which measures the phase of the acoustic oscillation , and an enhancement of the odd peak heights .",
    "it was found that though a distinctly different set of `` sine '' peak ratios was a common prediction of isocurvature models , details of the source evolution could be tuned to reproduce the inflationary case ( see also @xcite ) so that the peak height test is also necessary .",
    "we now consider whether additional assumptions , such as scaling in a strictly causal stress model , can produce further robust distinctions .",
    "-0.5truecm = 3.5 in = 3.5 in      let us now specialize the analysis of @xcite to the case where the source pressure fluctuations are from seeds that obey the scaling ansatz discussed in  [ ss - scaling ] .",
    "specifically , let us break the pressure source into contributions that behave as @xmath67 with @xmath49 .",
    "this choice is similar to and inspired by the ansatz of @xcite but replaces the assumption for @xmath68 with the analogous one for @xmath69 since stress fluctuations are the fundamental source of causally - seeded perturbations .",
    "this allows energy - momentum conservation to fix the form of density perturbations naturally from the stress fluctuations and permits a wider class of possible seed sources ( see appendix [ sec - mimic ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we here assume that the seed anisotropic stress @xmath70 and postpone discussion of its effect until the next section .",
    "we show the evolution of the system under the source eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pressurebasis ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure]a . we have chosen @xmath71 since this is the most extreme of the causal modes in that it produces features in the source as soon as causally possible .",
    "the initial conditions require a vanishing comoving curvature @xmath72 or equivalently vanishing stress - energy pseudo - tensor components @xmath73 .",
    "as long as the initial conditions are set early enough so that the pressure has not generated significant perturbations , this may be satisfied by setting the individual energy density and momentum density perturbations of the fluids and sources to zero .",
    "note that in the more general context in which the source fluctuations are directly related to density fluctuations , one must be more careful in setting up consistent compensated initial conditions .",
    "we make the important assumption here that the universe is radiation dominated as the fluctuation enters the horizon which we will discuss further below ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "note that the sign change in the pressure at @xmath77 has no direct relevance to the question of acoustic phase .",
    "the action of a source near or outside the horizon generically drives a sine mode acoustic wave due to feedback from the self - gravity of the photon - baryon fluid .",

    "this shifts the acoustic features toward smaller scales and further away from the predictions of inflation . on the other hand",

    "the fluid then turns around to fall into the growing potential wells of the source .",
    "thus the qualitative effect of anisotropic stress on the cmb is the same as isotropic stress : the feature at jeans crossing corresponds to a rarefaction in the effective temperature and is suppressed in comparison to the main compressional feature due to infall into the potential well of the source .",

    "we have assumed that @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpar ] , we show how the time evolution of the effective temperature varies with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "notice that altering the rapidity of the fall off through @xmath94 has little effect on the acoustic structure whereas decreasing @xmath93 shifts the main features toward later times and hence smaller scales .",
    "thus the anisotropic stress models which have features closest to those of inflation set @xmath88 .    thus , we can conclude that anisotropic stress fluctuations tend to shift the main features toward smaller scales .",
    "like the result for pressure fluctuations , this implies that any feature that is near the first peak in an inflationary model must be sub - dominant , leading to a low - high - low prediction for the heights of the features ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] ) .",
    "as such , these models are easily distinguished from inflation .",
    "-0.5truecm = 3.5 in = 3.5 in      since the effects of causal pressure and anisotropic stress fluctuations are both individually distinguishable from those of inflation , one expects that the combination of the two would result in a spectrum equally distinguishable unless there is interference between the modes . to better quantify our intuition and identify possible loopholes , it is instructive to recall the physical basis for the differences in the cmb spectra .    the crucial distinction between all of these isocurvature models and the inflation is the behavior of the fluctuations during horizon crossing . in an isocurvature model ,",
    "any source density fluctuations at this epoch must be compensated to keep the total density fluctuation small .",
    "if the photons take part in this compensation , as they must if they are the dominant dynamical component at the epoch of horizon crossing , this implies an anticorrelation between the source and photon density fluctuations .",
    "inflationary models generate adiabatic fluctuations so that the density fluctuations of all the species are correlated at horizon crossing .",
    "this leads to observable consequences with the _ additional _ assumption that overdense regions of the source represent gravitational potential wells .",
    "the compton drag of the baryons on the photons attempts to compress the photon - baryon fluid in the potential well . in inflationary models ,",
    "the photons are already overdense inside the well such that this effect enhances the first peak and subsequently all odd ( compressional ) peaks . in isocurvature models ,",
    "the opposite occurs leading to a reduction of the first ( rarefaction ) peak and an enhancement of the second and all even peaks .",
    "there are two basic assumptions to this chain of reasoning .",
    "the first is that the photons must play a role in the causal compensation .",
    "it is possible to construct a model in which the universe is fully matter dominated at horizon crossing for all observable peaks where this assumption is invalid @xcite .",
    "however , we have shown in  [ ss - pressure ] that this does not occur in a model with the standard thermal history and reasonable cosmological parameters .",
    "the second assumption is that overdense regions of the source , here taken to mean all contributions external to the photon - baryon system , represent potential wells .",
    "this is generally a reasonable assumption even in the isocurvature case since the ability of the photon - density perturbation to counteract the source is diminished as the fluctuation passes the jeans length .",
    "thus source overdensities represent total overdensities .",
    "the poisson equation implies that overdensities represent positive curvature fluctuations and hence potential wells _",
    "if _ the anisotropic stress is negligible in comparison to the density fluctuation [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : psipi ] ) ] .",
    "the latter assumption opens up the possibility that anisotropic stress provides a loophole to these arguments . more specifically , if @xmath96 , then _",
    "under_dense regions of the source represent potential wells and the above expectation for the relative heights of the peaks is inverted .",
    "however , this does not occur if we just simply take a model with large anisotropic stress @xmath54 ( see  [ ss - anisotropic ] ) .",
    "the reason is that a large anisotropic stress moves matter around to create a correspondingly large density perturbation .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation laws for a seed source [ from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : conserve ] ) for wavelengths well below the background curvature scale ] @xmath97 imply that for @xmath98 , @xmath54 is typically a strong source of density fluctuations .",
    "can we ever construct a model in which @xmath99 ?",
    "an exception to the above arguments occurs if @xmath100 .",
    "the stresses are then so balanced as to maintain a large anisotropic stress without generating a correspondingly large density perturbation ( see discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] ) .",
    "it is _ not _ sufficient to have merely @xmath101 to achieve this balance .    for this one exceptional case ,",
    "it is possible here to have gravitational potentials generated by anisotropic stress instead of density perturbations .",
    "if such a model additionally has the peaks in the inflationary positions _ and _ yields approximately constant gravitational potential perturbations , it is possible to evade the arguments of hu & white @xcite .",
    "even though the individual effects of pressure and anisotropic stress fluctuations lead to predictions in accord with the canonical isocurvature model , the two may cancel in this way to evade such expectations .",
    "following turok @xcite , we explicitly construct such an example in appendix [ sec - mimic ] .",
    "such models rely on a special relation between the pressure , anisotropic stress and density fluctuations and are thus unstable to perturbations in the equation of state [ see discussion surrounding eq .",
    "( [ eqn : unstable ] ) ] .    in summary ,",
    "the two assumptions underlying the case for the distinguishability of inflation from isocurvature models from the acoustic signature are that the photons are dynamically significant at jeans crossing and that potential wells represent overdense regions in space .",
    "these criteria are satisfied by a wide range of models including all those currently under consideration involving defects which have observable acoustic signatures .",
    "all of the causal models for the formation of large scale structure currently being considered can be divided into two classes : ( a ) inflationary models , which have curvature fluctuations on superhorizon scales and ( b ) scaling seeded - models , such as strings and textures . in the latter case ,",
    "there are no initial curvature fluctuations and stress fluctuations only generate them through the causal redistribution of matter under energy - momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "we have presented a thorough discussion of this process that can be used to study the general properties of any model that proposes a causal mechanism for large scale structure formation without postulating an inflationary epoch .",
    "we apply these techniques to study a representative class of scaling models inspired by turok @xcite . for models dominated by white noise isotropic stress fluctuations ,",
    "the acoustic signature in the cmb angular power spectrum follows the canonical signature of a baryon - isocurvature model .",
    "physically , this robust signature arises from the ability of photon - backreaction to drive the acoustic oscillation @xcite , a feature that must be included in a self - consistent calculation .",
    "models dominated by anisotropic stress fluctuations tend to be even more extreme , with main features pushed toward smaller scales .",
    "hence both classes are easily distinguished from inflation by experiments currently underway ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : family ] ) .    a realistic model , such as strings or textures , may contain additional complications beyond the simple toy - models explored in this paper , such as tensor and vector contributions as well as reionization",
    ". it can also require non - linear evolution of the sources that couple the normal modes discussed here and leave non - gaussian signatures in the cmb and/or cause decoherence in the oscillation @xcite . however , such complications are likely to make alternate models less , rather than more , like inflation .",
    "the analysis in this paper also reinforces the conclusions of @xcite : in an inflationary model , even peaks are produced by rarefaction waves and odd peaks are produced by compression waves . on the other hand in isocurvature models ,",
    "even peaks are produced by compression waves and odd peaks are produced by rarefaction waves .",
    "as long as the energy density in radiation at decoupling is significant and gravitational potential wells represent overdense regions , such a model can not reproduce the inflationary cmb signature without the equivalent of putting in the features by hand .    _",

    "there are four functions @xmath209 , @xmath34 , @xmath210 and @xmath54 that define the stress - energy tensor of the seed source and two constraint equations from energy - momentum conservation [ see eqs .",

    "this leaves two free functions that may be specified .",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath54 have different superhorizon scale behavior it is not possible to apply the desired constraint @xmath207 directly .",

    "momentum conservation also implies that @xmath215 scales as @xmath7 for @xmath216 . the remaining condition can be taken as a causal constraint on @xmath217 . note that this choice directly specifies both of the synchronous gauge gravitational sources",

    "causality is enforced in the manner of  [ ss - scaling ] by requiring @xcite @xmath218 .",
    "\\label{eqn : turokbasis } \\end{array}\\ ] ] for computational convenience , we relax the assumption of pure scaling in @xmath219 at the matter - radiation transition , defining @xmath220 which requires @xmath221 to take the form , @xmath222 thus @xmath223 and @xmath221 interpolate between constants in the radiation and matter dominated epochs .",
    "an examination of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cconserve ] ) shows that for @xmath224 the stress - energy components take the form @xmath225 for _ all _ @xmath83,@xmath93,@xmath94 as desired .",
    "the additional parameters merely determine at what point the model takes on this special form for the stress - energy tensor .",
    "since @xmath226 is the source of gravitational potential fluctuations of the seed @xmath62 , this implies that at late times @xmath227 and thus overdensities of the seed provide no gravitational attraction for the other matter components in the universe .",
    "it is important that @xmath61 and hence @xmath228 are constant in order to remove metric `` stretching '' effects of the source as well as infall .",
    "again this illustrates the very special nature of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : turokstressenergy ] ) : not only must there exist a relation between the stresses but also some components of @xmath229 must be _ constant _ while others must be _ zero_. we comment on the stability of this situation below .    by breaking the relation between overdensities ( or more strictly speaking curvature fluctuations ) and potential fluctuations the door for mimicking inflation has been openned .",
    "one still needs to actually _ reverse _ the sign of gravity such that matter tends to fall out of overdense regions of the seed .",
    "this is readily achieved if an additional component such as cold dark matter ( cdm ) exists in the universe .",
    "causality requires that this additional component have density fluctuations anticorrelated with the seed at horizon crossing .",
    "since density fluctuations in this component create gravitational potential wells whereas those in the seed do not , the net result is that underdense regions of the seed correspond to gravitational potential wells .",
    "the fundamental criterion for the existence of a counterexample has now been met ( see  [ ss - assumptions ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since these potential wells arise from cdm fluctuations and both the infall and `` stretching '' gravitational effects of the source are absent , they are constant in the matter - dominated epoch which results in a baryon - drag signal of alternating peaks that can closely mimic the standard - cdm inflationary prediction .",
    "we show an explicit calculation of such a model with @xmath71 , @xmath88 , and @xmath230 in fig .",
    "[ fig : loophole ] .",
    "the initial conditions are established in this synchronous gauge calculation to eliminate the components of the stress - energy pseudo - tensor by detailed balance of the seed and fluid components , @xmath231 , @xmath232 and all other components zero .",
    "formally the fluid velocities do not vanish , but we found that setting them to zero initially gave the same answers as including the compensation . ] .",
    "finally let us briefly discuss the implications of constraints of the form eq .",
    "( [ eqn : turokbasis ] ) to support the claim that it is the special form of the stress - energy tensor in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : turokstressenergy ] ) rather than some more general causal property that permits this counterexample . for example",
    ", in the synchronous gauge it might seem that fixing @xmath219 _ alone _ is sufficient to determine the behavior of cmb fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in synchronous gauge , the metric perturbation is specified by two functions , @xmath137 and @xmath138 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : synchmetric ] ) ] .",
    "the important point to note about the metric evolution equations ( [ eqn : synchpoisson ] ) is that @xmath137 , but not @xmath138 , is only dependent on the evolution of @xmath139 type sources .",
    "likewise the conservation equations ( [ eqn : synchcont ] ) and ( [ eqn : syncheuler ] ) imply that before last scattering , the photon evolution is driven only by @xmath137 .",
    "thus the synchronous temperature perturbation at last scattering is purely determined by the assumption for @xmath219 .",
    "this does _ not _ however imply that the structure of the observed anisotropy is so determined . to obtain the observed anisotropy",
    ", one must free - stream the radiation from the last - scattering surface to the present .",
    "after last scattering , the gravitational redshift from @xmath138 which is dependent on the form of @xmath210 generates photon quadrupole fluctuations [ see e.g.  @xcite  eq .  ( 63 ) ] .",
    "this is in fact obvious from the newtonian treatment which mixes @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath54 in the gravitational source for acoustic oscillations in the effective temperature [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phis ] ) ] . since gauge choice does not affect _ physical observables _",
    ", the two must predict the same anisotropy for a given source model : they just choose to divide it into fluid temperature and gravitational redshift in different manners .",
    "thus one can not simply use the fluid temperature in synchronous gauge to make arguments about the corresponding temperature in the newtonian gauge without fully specifying the model .",
    "now let us consider whether any other choice besides the asymptotic form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : turokstressenergy ] ) is possible for such seed contributions .",
    "let us rewrite the conservation equation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cconserve ] ) as @xmath233 4\\pi g a^2{\\rho_s}=- \\left [ { d \\over d\\tau } \\left({\\displaystyle{{\\dot a \\over a}}}\\right ) + 2\\left ( { \\displaystyle{{\\dot a \\over a}}}\\right)^2 + { \\displaystyle{{1 \\over 3}}}k^2 \\right ] 4\\pi g a^2(\\rho_s + 3{p_s } ) +       { \\displaystyle{{8 \\over 3 } } } \\pi g a^2 k^2 { \\pi_s}. \\label{eqn : unstable}\\ ] ] if we also require @xmath234 as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : turokbasis ] ) , then this equation is dynamically unstable and requires @xmath235 to diverge unless @xmath236 . thus the only model that can be constructed out of the @xmath237 form assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : turokbasis ] ) , or indeed any form which implies @xmath238 at late times , satisfies eq .  ( [ eqn : turokstressenergy ] ) . such models _ must _ have the novel property of anisotropic stress fluctuations cancelling the gravitational attraction of matter to the seed overdensities .",
    "of course , this relation need only hold for scales upon which acoustic peaks are visible in the cmb .",
