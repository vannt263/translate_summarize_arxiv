    "the formation of cosmic structures in the universe is one of the key problems in cosmology . in the current , standard theory ( see , e.g , peebles 1993 ) , they develop from the amplification of initially small density perturbations due to gravitational instability . for a collisionless self - gravitating",
    "fluid ( similar to the non - baryonic dark matter , believed to dynamically dominate the universe ) , the description of such process is given by the usual hydrodynamical equations for the velocity and the density fields ( euler and continuity equations ) in expanding coordinates plus the poisson equation coupling the gravitational potential @xmath2 to the density field @xmath9 . in the linear stage , when the growing density is sufficiently small , such equations can be solved analytically using a first order perturbation technique for the eulerian density and velocity fields ; higher order perturbation theory can give insights on the quasi - linear regime where , although small , @xmath9 becomes comparable to unity ( see , e.g. , munshi , sahni & starobinsky 1994 ) ; however , the non - linear regime when @xmath10 is usually followed in detail through numerical n - body simulations ( see bertschinger 1998 for a review ) . these show that gravitational instability of dark matter can indeed lead to the kind of large scale structures observed in the universe ( starting from de lapparent , geller & huchra 1986 ;",
    "see maddox et a. 1990 ; saunders et al .",
    "1991 ; vogeley et al . 1992 ; schectman et al .",
    "1996 ) , which include filamentary overdensities and two - dimensional sheet - like structures , the so called pancakes ; at the confluence of such one- or two - dimensional structures , high constrast ( @xmath11 ) , knotty structures appear to form , corresponding to galaxy clusters .    at the same time , several approximation schemes and semi - analytical approaches have been developed for studying the formation of large scale structures ( hereafter lss ) .",
    "the aim of such approaches is to gain an insight into the physical processes leading to structure formation , to comprehend and check the results of the simulations and to provide a computational tool which is usually faster and easier to implement .    the first step in an analytic approach to lss",
    "was taken by zeldovich ( 1970 ) , who proposed to extrapolate the linear behaviour of the velocity field in the non - linear regime and to express the evolution of each particle in terms of its lagrangian coordinates . in this case",
    ", the trajectory of each particle evolves along the free - flight path determined by the initial lagrangian velocity ( for a review , see e.g. , shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) . in terms of the velocity potential @xmath3 ( as long as no orbit crossing occurs the flow is irrotational and",
    "the velocity can be expressed as @xmath12 ) , it can be easily shown that this corresponds to assume the velocity potential equal to the gravitational potential , a condition which holds in linear theory .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( za ) turned out to work suprisingly well , even beyond the regime where its approximations are realistic ( see , e.g. , melott et al . 1983 ;",
    "shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ; sahni & coles 1995 ) .",
    "however , it presents some shortcomings , which can be traced back to the neglection of the back reaction of the evolving density field on the gravitational field , and hence on the particle velocities .",
    "thus , small - scale variations are transferred to much larger scales , resulting in a poor description of overdense regions ; the collapse time of condensations is in general overestimated ; the absence of a restoring force results in the formation of multi - stream regions , due to the crossing of particle orbits , so that pancakes indefinitely thicken after their formation .    to overcome the above problems several improvements have been proposed . the lagrangian perturbation theory developed by several authors ( see moutarde et al . 1991 ; buchert & ehlers 1993 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1995 ) includes the za as a first order solution ; at higher orders , the particle displacement field is determined not only by the initial lagrangian velocity ( like in za ) but also by the acceleration field . when compared with n - body simulations ( see bouchet et al .",
    "1995 ; melott , buchert & weiss 1995 ) the higher - orders lagrangian approach turns out to improve the za for what concerns the first collapsing objects , the statistics of overdense regions and the compactness of clusters ; on the other hand , underdense regions are better described in za . in any case , the thickening of pancakes after shell- crossing remains as a major drawback of such elaborate models .",
    "alternative approaches aiming at overcoming the thickening of pancakes typical of the za are constituted by the frozen - flow approximation ( matarrese et al .",
    "1992 ) , the linear potential approximation ( bagla & padmanabhan 1994 ; brainerd , scherrer & villumsen ) and the adhesion approximation ( aa hereafter ; gurbatov & saichev 1984 ; gurbatov , saichev & shandarin 1985 ; gurbatov , saichev & shandarin 1989 ; for reviews see shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ; vergassola et al .",
    "1994 ; sahni & coles 1995 ) .",
    "the first two propose to `` freeze '' the initial velocity and potential field , respectively , to their initial value ; particles then move with a velocity determined by the local eulerian value of the initial velocity potential ( or following the line of force of the initial gravitational potential in the linear - potential approximation ) .",
    "such approaches avoid the shell - crossing occurring in za but , as shown by comparison with aimed n - body simulations ( sathyaprakash et a. 1995 ) , break down relatively early , soon after the non - linear length scale exceeds the mean distance between peaks of the gravitational potential ; in particular , the frozen - flow approximation , although reproducing reasonably well the density probability distribution of the dark matter field , fails in moving the mass particles to the right places when compared with the n - body simulations .",
    "the aa , on the other hand , takes on the basic assumption of the za ( i.e. , the equality of the gravitational and velocity potentials ) and introduces an artificial viscosity into the euler equation to avoid orbit crossing . although introduced phenomenologically , later investigations by buchert & dominguez ( 1998 ) show that it is indeed possible to obtain viscosity- like terms from kinetic theory of self - gravitating collisionless systems ( although the corresponding multi - stream forces are , in general , anisotropic , unlike the assumption of the aa ) .",
    "the effect of the viscosity @xmath0 in the limit @xmath13 can be straightforwardly computed ; particles initially follow their linear trajectories ( the same of the za ) , but when flow lines intersect , the colliding particles stick to each other , thus binding collapsed structures and fixing the principal failure of the za .",
    "the networks of structures resulting from implementations of the aa have a remarkable resemblence with those emerging from n - body simulations ; indeed , rms density fluctuations agree to better than 20 % on scales larger than @xmath14 mpc ( weinberg & gunn 1990a ; kofman et al .",
    "1992 ; see also melott , shandarin & weinberg 1994 ) .",
    "such agreement makes aa a reliable tool for sevaral astrophysical applications concerning lss ( see , e.g. , nusser & dekel 1990 ; weinberg & gunn 1990b ) .    despite of the the successes listed above in reproducing the texture of lss ,",
    "the aa model is a much less satisfactory description when structures at smaller scales are considered ( weinberg & gunn 1990a ; kofman et al .",
    "the density field is less clumpy than appears in n - body simulations , where walls and filaments fragment into dense clumps , at variance with the outcomes of aa .",
    "this is of course a conseguence of neglecting the back - reaction of the particle distribution on the evolution of the velocity field .",
    "here it is proposed an eulerian approach to extend the aa to deeper , non - linear regimes .",
    "it allows both to avoid the shell - crossing problem of the za and to go beyond the approximation ( valid in the linear regime ) stating the equality between the velocity and the gravitational potential , which is the basic ansatz of both the za and the aa descriptions . as a result , the velocity field felt by a particle at any given time is affected by the dynamical evolution occurred up to the considered time , as it must be in the non - linear regime ( see coles & chiang 2000 ) .",
    "the equation governing the evolution of the _ velocity field _ is found by expanding the relation bewteen @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in general non explicitly computable , in powers of the small viscosity @xmath0 . in this case , the bernoulli equation which governs the evolution of the velocity potential in aa can be recast ( after the hopf - cole transformation @xmath4 ) as a diffusion - like equation with a source term @xmath5 constituted by an expansion in powers of @xmath0 ; such term expresses the departure of the velocity field @xmath3 from the linear behaviour @xmath1 , assumed to hold in aa .",
    "since the lowest order term in @xmath5 can be expressed in a completely eulerian form , it is possible to solve such equation in the eulerian space _ in this restricted case_.    the solution is obtained using the formalism of brownian motion , equivalent to the path - integral formulation used in quantum mechanics and in statistical physics . in the limit of small times",
    ", @xmath15 , ( corresponding to a null potential in the language of path - integrals ) one recovers the standard aa , which thus constitutes , in the language of path - integrals , a free - particle theory ( see also jones 1999 ) whose solution is determined in terms of the initial field ; the first order term of the potential @xmath5  corresponding to a `` theory with interactions '' in the language of path - integrals  introduces the non - linear corrections to aa ; the solution at a generic time depends not only on the initial field , but also on its values at all previous times and at all other coordinates .    to test the proposed description ,",
    "the solution is applied to the cosmological evolution of a cold dark matter density field .",
    "the corresponding velocity field is obtained numerically at any time by constructing  for each eulerian coordinate  a set of random trees , which are used to compute the path - integrals with specific forms of the interaction potential . for a null potential , this constitutes a novel implementation of the aa which is free from the numerical errors affecting finite - difference solution schemes for partial differential equation and it is faster than the gaussian convolution algorithm adopted by weinberg & gunn ( 1990a ) ; when the first order term in the path - integral potential is included , the evolved field gives a better description of small - scale , deeply non - linear regions , as shown by the comparison with an aimed n - body simulation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the bernoulli equation for the velocity potential @xmath3 typical of the aa model is introduced and extended beyond the linear evolution ( sect .",
    "2 ) . after a canonical change of variables ( the hopf - cole transformation ) such an equation",
    "is transformed into a diffusion - like equation for @xmath3 with a potential term which expresses the non - linear evolution of the transformed velocity potential .",
    "the latter term is expanded in powers of the artificial viscosity ; the solution for the leading order is obtained using the path - integral formalism ( sect .",
    "3 ) , and it is numerically implemented through the construction of random walks for the transformed velocity field ( sect .",
    "the results ( sect .",
    "5 ) are then compared with the outputs of an n - body simulation with a cold dark matter power spectrum for the initial density perturbation field .",
    "sects . 6 and 7 are devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "it can be easily shown that the euler equation for a collisionless self - gravitating fluid in the newtonian limit in the expanding universe can be conveniently rewritten as a bernoulli equation for the velocity potential , when rescaled variables are used ( gurbatov , saichev , & shandarin 1989 ; kofman 1991 ) .",
    "if the comoving peculiar velocity field @xmath16 is expressed in terms of the gradient of a velocity potential @xmath3 and of the time derivative of the expansion factor @xmath17 , then the evolution of the velocity potential is governed by @xmath18 here @xmath2 is the gravitational potential divided by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the initial time and expansion factors , respectively .",

    "is expected to introduce relevent modifications to the dynamics with respect to aa , thus representing a significant step forward in the description of the non - linear regime .",
    "first , we note that the source term @xmath68 is growing from zero with increasing time ( @xmath71 for @xmath72 ) as is expected for a term connected with the departure from linearity .",
    "thus , for small times the system behaves much like the aa ; at later times the term @xmath68 will set in , affecting the dynamics in the deeper non- linear regime .",

    "at early times , in the quasi - linear regime , further insight into the potential term @xmath68 can be gained by a series expansion of the velocity potential @xmath74 around the initial time @xmath21 ; terms of increasing order correspond to consider increasing powers of @xmath17 .",

    "the first order term ( the linear solution ) is the same for the exact theory , aa and ea , namely @xmath75 ; the second order term in aa and ea can be obtained by inserting the 1st - order solution in the @xmath76 term in the bernoulli eq . 1 ( at early times particles sticking occurring in aa and ea is unimportant , so that the viscosity term can be neglected in this restricted context ) and letting @xmath1 ( for aa , according to the zeldovich approximation ) or @xmath77 for the ea ( after transforming eqs . 14a and 14b back into the @xmath3 variable ) , where @xmath78 is the average over @xmath17 of the velocity potential which we express as @xmath79 .",
    "after the above procedure , the aa and ea solutions at 2nd order are @xmath80 and @xmath81(\\nabla\\phi_o)^2\\,a$ ] ; these have to be compared with the exact 2nd order solution which contains a non - local term ( i.e. @xmath82 $ ] , which is not reproduced by aa and by ea with the potential @xmath68 ) plus a local term @xmath83 ( see munshi & starobinsky 1994 ) .",
    "note that ( for @xmath84 at 2nd order ) the ea at second order yields @xmath85 which is closer to the exact term than aa .",
    "thus , when a time expansion of the velocity potential is considered for small times , the potential obtained from both ea and aa have the same spatial structure than the local part of the exact 2nd order correction , but the ea is closer in normalization to the exact solution .    at later times , a property of the dynamics described by eqs .",
    "( 14 ) is that the changes of the velocity field in the course of the evolution now explicitly affect the dynamics .",
    "in addition , as will be discussed in detail in  4.3 , the presence of a potential @xmath5 depending on @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) introduces non - local features in the solution , so that the field @xmath86 depends on the value of the field at other eulerian points .",
    "this feature is expected to arise in the non - linear regime , since the density fluctuations cease to evolve independently and `` feel '' the effect of the whole mass distribution ( we refer to  7 for a more extended discussion on the effects of the term @xmath68 on the overall evolution of lss ) .    to quantitatively explore the above effects we now proceed to solve the diffusion equation ( 14 ) , restricting to consider only the first term @xmath68 .",

    "3 . again this is related to the the lack of fragmentation of filamentary structures typical of aa .",

    "the above consideration about the mass distribution in the different schemes can be tested more quantitatively though the computation of some basic statistical indicators .",
    "in particular , the correlation function @xmath192 and the rms density @xmath193 are computed as a function of the scale @xmath194 , where the latter is obtained by counting the density of particles in cells with radius @xmath194 , and averaging over the simulation volume .",

    "the same statistical properties seem to be well reproduced by ea , as it is shown by the agreement with the n - body results in fig .",
    "5 which is preserved down to the resolution limit of the simulations . again ,",

    "the key points characterizing the proposed approach ( extended adhesion , ea ) can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 ) the dynamics emerging from such a novel description is determined by a diffusion - like equation for the transformed velocity potential @xmath4 .",
    "such equation includes a source term @xmath5 ( or an `` interaction '' term in the action , if the diffusion equation is considered like a shredinger equation in euclidean time ) which grows from zero ( the limit corresponding to the aa ) with increasing time ; this in fact describes the onset of non - linear evolution of the velocity potential .",
    "the aa is ten recovered , in the path - integral language , as a free - particle theory .",
    "\\2 ) when the `` potential '' @xmath5 is expanded in powers of the small artificial viscosity @xmath0 , the term corresponding to the lowest order can be expressed in a fully eulerian form . in this case",
    "it is possible to compute a solution for @xmath8 based on the realization of random walks in the eulerian space .",
    "the solution at the time @xmath17 and at the point @xmath40 is related to a proper sum over the fields computed at the preceding times at the eulerian coordinates reached by a gaussian random walk starting from @xmath40 at the initial time .",
    "\\3 ) such solution of the diffusion equation explicitly shows that the source term introduced in the proposed extension of aa affects the dynamics in two , key respects : i ) the velocity potential @xmath3 at a given time is no longer determined by its initial form , but depends on the values taken at all previous times ; ii ) the value taken by @xmath3 at a given point depends on the value taken at the other points .",
    "both these features are characteristic of the non - linear dynamical regime , when the density and fluctuations cease to evolve independently and `` feel '' the effect of the whole mass distribution .",
    "thus , the proposed extension of the adhesion approximation is expected to provide a better description of the regions which underwent a deeper non - linear evolution . to test such expectation ,",
    "the solution for the velocity field in the extended adhesion approach has been used to compute the time evolution of a cosmological dark matter field , and the results have been tested against n - body simulations .    when one restricts to consider a null source term @xmath7 , the adhesion approximation with finite visosity is recovered .",
    "in this case our results and comparison with the n - body simulations yield results similar to those in weinberg & gunn ( 1990a ) , as is shown qualitatively by the particle spatial distribution ( fig .",
    "2 ) and quantitatively by the correlation function and mean overdensity plots .",
    "however , the random walk approach adopted here yields shorter computational time than the gaussian convolution method adopted by the above authors , resulting into a gain over the simulation a factor 2 - 3 larger .    when the `` interaction '' term @xmath68 is set in , the evolution of the velocty field in the extended adhesion approach is succesful in reproducing most of the features emerging from the n - body simulations , including the fragmentation of large scale structures into dense lumps .",
    "the correlation function an the mean overdensity as a function of scale resulting from our extended adhesion model agree remarkably with those from the n - body even at small scales ( see fig . 5 ) . at larger scales and for underdsense regions , our extension of the zeldovich ansatz",
    "@xmath199 leaves invariant the satisfying agreement of the zeldovich and adhesion approximation with the outcomes of the simulations ; this is at variance with other semi - analytic aproaches to lss ( like the lagrangian perturbation theory at second order , bouchet et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the above results indicate that the lowest - order term @xmath68 in the equation for the velocity potential is effective in capturing some relavant features of the non - linear evolution of the velocity field .",
    "the physical meaning of such term , as compared with the higher - order one @xmath69 entering eq .",
    "( 14 ) , is straightforward .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq14b ] ) and of the hopf - cole trasformation @xmath4 shows that such term corresponds to considering the effect of the _ time average _ of the velocity potential in the course of evolution .",
    "thus , the solutions presented here correspond in a sense to `` mean field '' solutions . it is not surprising , then , that these constitute the lowest - order correction to the `` free - particle '' behaviour , corresponding to aa .",
    "the consideration of higher - order terms in @xmath5 would then correspond to consider the detailed effect of each single particle on the evolution of the eulerian velocity potential .",
    "this effect , of course , is related to the detailed history of each particle and correspondingly it is expressed by non - local terms which involve integrals over the particle trajectory , like those in the term @xmath69 entering eq .",
    "as recalled above , the dynamics described by the ea through the time - evolving velocity potential derived from eqs .",
    "( 14a ) and ( 14b ) allows to improve the description of the high - density regions , more deeply evolved in the non - linear regime .",
    "this improvement allows i ) to extend the insight on the physics of lss to include the evolution of higher - density regions , and ii ) to extend the cosmological applications of za and ea to a larger density range including overdensities up to ( at least ) @xmath200 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) where ea ( at variance with za and aa ) still provides a satisfactory description . we shall now discuss the above two points in turn :    previous works based on n - body simulations ( melott , weinberg & gott 1988 ) and on implementations of aa ( weinberg & gunn 1990a ) suggested that on sufficiently large scales the process of non - linear gravitational evolution may be viewed as a smoothing proces on the initial density field ; indeed , the results for the aa ( weinberg & gunn 1990a ) showed that the density field resulting at a given cosmic time is well approximated by the initial density field smoothed over a scale corresponding to @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the average particle displacement at that time ( i.e. , the average comoving distance that a particle has moved from its initial position ) .",
    "the aa allows to pin down the origin of such a behaviour ; indeed , for large scales where aa is a satisfactory approximation , the _ diffusion _ term in the burgers equation for the velocity field ( or equivalently in the equation 1 for the velocity potential ) has the effect that the velocity field at a point incorporates the contributions from the surrounding patch of initial conditions .",
    "this is explicitly shown by the corresponding form of the velocity potential ( eqs .",
    "3 - 4 ) and by the random walk solution illustrated in fig .",
    "1 ; as noted by weinberg & gunn ( 1990a ) the non - linear hopf - cole transformation @xmath203 in the solution of the bernoulli eq .",
    "( 1 ) amplifies gradients so that the diffusive smoothing has the greater impact where it is most needed .",
    "the latter point is shared by ea ; however , the graphical illustration ( fig .",
    "1 ) of the ea solution for the velocity field shows that , for sufficiently large times at the onset of the term @xmath68 , a second process overlaps to diffusive smoothing in determining the evolution of lss ; in fact , the velocity field at a point is now influenced by the value of the field at times closer to present , as shown in detail in fig .",
    "thus , regions with larger overdensities ( corresponding to larger velocities in the surroundings ) aquire a larger and larger role in driving the evolution of @xmath3 , and this has the effect of enhancing the disomogeneities in the density field .",
    "this is apparent also from the path - integral solution in eq .",
    "( 20 ) , which shows that the random diffusion term ( the `` kinetic '' part of the action @xmath204 which corresponds to the `` smoothing '' mode ) is now complemented by the potential term @xmath5 ; of all the paths that contribute to the integral , those passing through maxima of @xmath5 ( at _ evolved _ times ) make the dominant contribution to the integral .",
    "thus , the potential term in eq .",
    "( 20 ) acts like a `` selection '' term ( in contrast with the  smoothing  term driving the whole dynamics in aa ) which progressively weights the more non - linear regions in determining the evolution of @xmath8 .",
    "it is this latter effect which drives the fragmentation of filaments into several knots ( see figs . 2 - 4 ) observed at late times in n - body simulation and missing from the aa dynamics .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "5 shows that such second mode in the lss evolution begins to efficiently overlap to the diffusive smoothing already at @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the non - linear gravitational evolution can be viewed as smoothing process of the initial conditions for @xmath206 , as suggested by previous works on aa ; for larger overdensities at @xmath207 the velocity gradient induced by small - scale overdensities overlaps to the smoothing mode so that particles flow along the filaments to enhance small - scale overdensities , partially breaking the extended structures into dense knots .",
    "a finer description of such process , includes the effect of each particle trajectory in the modification of the velocity field and corresponds to the term @xmath69 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) .    as to the investigation of cosmological problems",
    ", ea can be used to complement n - body simulations in several ways : first , the shorter computational time taken by ea to run allows a more extensive exploration of the parameter space in many astrophysical problems ; second , ea can be used in the developement or testing phase of investigation techniques which require a large number of simulations ; third , it can be used to estimate the probability for a given configuration ( both in density and in velocity ) to occur , a problem which may also require running a large number of simulations .",
    "it must be noticed that the above advantages are shared with other approximations like za and aa ; however , ea allows to describe a wider range of overdensities ( see , e.g. fig 5 ) , thus extending the fields of investigation and allowing to address additional problems . a first example is constituted by the study of ly@xmath208 regions and , in general , by the comparison of theoretical predictions with the observations concerning the intergalactic medium",
    "indeed , several authors have used the za ( with an appropriate smoothing on initial conditions ) to study the distribution of ly@xmath208 column densities ( hui , gnedin , & zhang 1997 ; gnedin & hui 1998 ) ; the density and velocity field derived from za were related to the gas density , temperature and composition by an independently derived equation of state .",
    "the resulting distribution of ly@xmath208 column density can be compared with observations and a large variety of parameters ( concerning the cosmology , the equation of state of the gas , the reionization epoch and the ionazing radiation ) can explored through the use of the fast za algorithm .",
    "however , such approach could be applied only for density contrast @xmath206 ( corresponding to column densities @xmath209",
    "@xmath210 ) due to the break down of za ( and also of aa as shown by fig .",
    "5 ) at higher density contrast . in this context",
    ", ea could extend the range of such kind of investigation to larger density contrast and hence to larger column densities . in this context",
    ", such investigations could be further extended to include ( at least partially ) baryons at temperatures @xmath211 k residing in higher density contrast @xmath212 , which could constitute a relevant ( if not major ) fraction of all existing baryons ( see , e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "while a full treatement of them requires full hydrodynamical simulations including shock heating , preliminary studies and parameter exploration concerning the statistics of column densities of such gas could be performed through ea .",
    "once a smaller set of plausible models is identified with this technique full hydrodynamical simulations can be run .",
    "further examples of cosmolgical studies through ea can be constituted by the computation of the density distribution produced in the mildly non - linear regime extending to density @xmath200 in a variety of cosmological conditions ; this enters many analytical or semi - analytical computations concerning the thermal and chemical state of the intergalactic medium ( which are also being included in semi - analytic models of galaxy formations , see benson et al .",
    "additional applications concern the extension to larger overdensities of a reliable velocity - density relation ( widely investigated with the use za up to densities @xmath213 , see nusser , dekel , bertshinger & blumenthal 1991 ; see also weinberg & gunn 1990b ) , particulary used for the analysis of large - scale flows and for the inverse problem of deriving the velocity field corresponding to observed galaxy distribution .",
    "besides complementing the n - body simulations in evolving numerically a dark matter field , the compact , anlytical form ( eq .",
    "14 ) for the evolution of the velocity field constitutes a promising way to study directly and analytically relevant scaling properties for the collisionless fluid .",
    "in particular , it is known that the solution of equations similar to ( 14 ) with a random source term @xmath214 show interesting fractal ( brax 1992 ) and intermittency ( grtner & molchanov 1992 ) properties .",
    "indeed , an approach involving a diffusion equation with a source term for the velocity field has been used by jones ( 1999 ) to relate the _ baryonic _ velocity field ( the one following the diffusion equation in such model ) to the dark matter potential ( the source term ) which , in this approach , is given as an input .",
    "the intermittency and fractal properties of the baryonic velocity field in this model ( which give rise to nice scaling properties of the resulting galaxy distribution ) are probably features which are shared by the velocity field in our model . while the investigation of such issues is more complicated in ea than in aa or za due to the more complex form of the velocity potential , it is nevertheless interesting to study the effects of the non - linear source term introduced by ea in the burgers equation on the fractal and intermittency properties of the resulting velocity field , since this would provide useful analytical tools to characterize the growth of lss in a more evolved non - linear stage than that probed by previous approximations .",
    "the investigation of such point will be the subject of a next paper .",

    "<S> a description of the dynamics of a collisionless , self - gravitating fluid is developed and applied to follow the development of large scale structures in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> such description takes on one of the assumptions of the adhesion approximation ( aa ) model , i.e. , the introduction of an artificial viscosity @xmath0 in the euler equation , but extends it to deeper non - linear stages , where the extrapolation of the linear relation @xmath1 between the velocity and the gravitational potentials  at the basis of both the zeldovich and the adhesion models  is no longer valid .    </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by expanding the relation bewteen @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in general non explicitly computable , in powers of the small viscosity @xmath0 . in this case , the evolution of the velocity potential is described by a diffusion - like equation for the `` expotential '' field @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> such equation includes a source term @xmath5 which expresses the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 as a series expansion in powers of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such term is related to the onset of the non - linear evolution of the velocity potential and grows from zero ( the limit corresponding to the adhesion approximation ) with increasing time . for terms in @xmath5 up to order @xmath6 ( the only ones which can be expressed in a fully eulerian form ) , the diffusion equation is solved using the path - integral approach .    the adhesion approximation is then recovered as a `` free - particle '' theory , ( corresponding to @xmath7 ) where the dynamics is determined by the initial value of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our inclusion of the lowest - order term in @xmath5 substantially changes the dynamics , so that the velocity potential at a given time in a given eulerian position depends on the values taken at all previous times in all other coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected in the non - linear regime where perturbations no longer evolve independently , but `` feel '' the changes of the surrounding density field .    </S>",
    "<S> the path - integral solution is computed numerically through an algorithm based on monte carlo realizations of random walks in the eulerian space . in particular , the solution @xmath8 at any cosmic time is obtained upon averaging the value of the potential @xmath5 at previous times in the eulerian locations reached by the random walks .    the solution is applied to the cosmological evolution of a cold dark matter density field , and the results are compared to the outcomes of an n- body simulation with the same initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity field in the presented extended adhesion ( ea ) description is obtained numerically using the random walks algorithm described above . for case of a null potential @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes a novel implementation of the adhesion approximation which is free from the numerical errors affecting finite - difference solution schemes for partial differential equation and is faster than the gaussian convolution algorithm adopted by weinberg & gunn ( 1990a ) . when the first order term of the potential @xmath5 is included , the proposed extension of the adhesion approach provides a better description of small - scale , deeply non - linear regions , as it is quantitatively shown by the computation of some statistical indicators . at larger scales , </S>",
    "<S> the satisfactory description of the large scale texture and of the voids given by the canonical adhesion approximation is preserved in the extended model . </S>"
