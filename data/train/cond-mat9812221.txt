    "<S> we study the dynamical behavior of an ensemble of oscillators interacting through short range bidirectional pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry is 1d with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> our interest is twofold . to explore the conditions required to reach fully synchronization and to invewstigate the time needed to get such state . </S>",
    "<S> we present both theoretical and numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the dynamic properties of populations of pulse - coupled oscillators are the starting point of many studies devoted to understand some phenomena such as synchronization , phase locking or the emergence of spatio - temporal patterns which appear so frequently when analyzing the behavior of heart pacemaker cells , integrate and fire neurons , and other systems made of excitable units [ peskin , 1984 ] , [ mirollo & strogatz , 1990 ] , [ kuramoto , 1991 ] , [ abbott & van vreeswijk , 1993 ] , [ treves , 1993 ] .    mean - field models or populations of just a few oscillators are the typical subject that has been considered in the scientific literature . in these simplified systems it is possible to investigate analytically the main mechanisms leading to the formation of assemblies of synchronized elements as well as other spatio - temporal structures . </S>",
    "<S> however , such restrictions do not allow to consider the effect of certain variables whose effect can be crucial for realistic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the specific topology or geometry of the system , as well as the precise connectivity between units are some typical examples which usually induce important changes in the collective behavior of these models . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , a rigorous mathematical description of them is still missing . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of studies rely on simulations showing the outstanding richness that a low dimensional system of pulse - coupled oscillators may display . </S>",
    "<S> some examples are self - organized criticality , chaos , quasiperiodicity , etc . </S>",
    "<S> [ perez et al . , 1996 ] . in other cases </S>",
    "<S> , it is proven the stability of some observed behaviors [ goldsztein & strogatz , 1995 ] , [ diaz guilera et al . , 1997 ] but not the mechanisms leading to them .    </S>",
    "<S> a first step forward has been given very recently by [ diaz guilera et al . </S>",
    "<S> , 1998 ] , hereafter called dpa . assuming a system defined on a ring </S>",
    "<S> , they developed a mathematical formalism powerful enough to get analytic information not only about the mechanisms which are responsible for synchronization and formation of spatio - temporal structures , but also , as a complement , to proof under which conditions they are stable solutions of the dynamical equations . </S>",
    "<S> they consider one - directional interactions which allow to simplify the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the study of a more general situation is desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to show that such formalism is able to handle more difficult situations . in particular , we consider here a population of pulse - coupled oscillators with bidirectional couplings . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is important because the backwards effect of the coupling might break the coherent activity of an ensemble of oscillators previously synchronized . </S>",
    "<S> small changes in local aspects of the coupling may lead to important cooperative effects .    let us start the discussion by introducing the model and the notation used throughout the paper . we have considered a population of @xmath0 pacemakers distributed on a ring . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry is interesting to analyze certain problems related to cardiac activity . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , to study some types of cardiac arrhythmia characterized by an abnormally rapid heartbeat whose period is set by the time that an excitation takes to travel a circuit . </S>",
    "<S> this observation can be explained by modeling appropriately the circulation of a wave of excitation in a one - dimensional ring [ ito & glass , 1992 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the sinus rhythm has been also studied in systems with similar geometry and bidirectional couplings [ ikeda , 1982 ] . </S>",
    "<S> other systems whose dynamical evolution is restricted to a limit cycle and therefore that can be described in terms of only one degree of freedom could also be tackle with the same tools .    </S>",
    "<S> the usual description of the state of one unit is performed in terms of one physical variable that , in general , it is voltage - like quantity . however , after a straightforward transformation [ corral et al . , </S>",
    "<S> 1995 ] it is always possible to write the evolution of each oscillator in terms of a phase variable @xmath1 $ ] which evolves linearly in time . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the effect of pulsating - interaction between oscillators can be written down through the so called phase response curve ( prc ) which measures the effective change in @xmath2 due to the firing process . </S>",
    "<S> in general , all the nonlinearities of the problem are included in this function . in this letter , we are interested in monotonic functions which are closely related to the convex character of the evolution of the voltage like variable in formal pacemakers ( perfect integrators ) . within this space of functions </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the linear case because is allows to get analytical results without losing any of the features which characterize the synchronization process between units . </S>",
    "<S> let us clarify this point . </S>",
    "<S> when a given unit reaches a threshold value @xmath3 , it fires and changes the state of its neighbors according to @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the nearest neighbors , @xmath7 is the strength of the coupling and where @xmath8 due to the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> according to the aforementioned definition @xmath9 is the prc .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the key points of the mathematical formalism relies on a suitable transformation which allows to trace the phases of the oscillators after each firing and construct return maps of the complete cycle . for details </S>",
    "<S> see [ corral et al . , </S>",
    "<S> 1995 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation which intrinsically includes translations and rotations always keeps information about the element of the population which will fire immediately . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very appropriate way to know details about the spatio - temporal structure which is dynamically forming at every time step .    from our point of view the most direct way to understand the mechanism underlying synchronization or any other time - dependent phenomenon is to start analyzing the simplest situation with physical interest . </S>",
    "<S> for a population with bidirectional couplings such case is to consider only four oscillators . in dpa and for the one - directional case the same scheme was applied . </S>",
    "<S> however , they started with even a more simpler situation , since only three elements were matter of attention . for bidirectional interactions </S>",
    "<S> such case is trivial due to the symmetry of the problem since one firing affect all the neighbors and from an effective point of view the problem is mean - field which has been already solved in [ mirollo & strogatz , 1990 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> for the four pacemakers system there are six possible sequences of firings such that one member of the population fires once and only once in each cycle . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the oscillator which fires is always labeled as unit @xmath10 and the rest of elements are ordered from this unit clockwise then these sequences are the following :    * a : 0,1,2,3 * b : 0,1,3,2 * c : 0,2,1,3 * d : 0,2,3,1 * e : 0,3,1,2 * f : 0,3,2,1    where the sequence has to be understood as the order in which oscillators reach the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical process of firings can be described in terms of a set of matrices which take into account the jump ( distance ) between those oscillators which fire consecutively [ diaz guilera et al , 1998 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to check that they are    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    and that a all the cycles related to the different orders are constructed by combining the three previous matrices as follows    * a : 0,1,2,3 @xmath14 @xmath15 * b : 0,1,3,2 @xmath14 @xmath16 * c : 0,2,1,3 @xmath14 @xmath17 * d : 0,2,3,1 @xmath14 @xmath18 * e : 0,3,1,2 @xmath14 @xmath19 * f : 0,3,2,1 @xmath14 @xmath20    where @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a vector with @xmath24 components since the zero - th component does not play any role in the description .    before computing the fixed points of the transformation as well as the stability of the associated eigenvalues let us notice that matrices @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 have exactly the same structure as in the one - directional coupling case except for one column which is multiplied by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore many properties of the new matrices can be discussed directly without the explicit calculation of them . </S>",
    "<S> in particular in dpa it was shown that the resultant matrices had eigenvalues with moduli larger or smaller than 1 depending on the sign of the coupling , i.e.e @xmath7 , which is rather important because it determines the stability of the fixed points and as a consequence ensures that for excitatory couplings the oscillators will synchronize their activity while for the inhibitory case complex spatio - temporal structures will be formed in the stationary state . </S>",
    "<S> now , these properties do not change at all . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the eigenvalues does not change and independently of the particular position of the new fixed points the conditions for stability are the same as in the one - directional case . even more , it is straightforward to show that the modulus of the eigenvalues that in the aforementioned case were larger than @xmath29 are now larger and the opposite for those which are smaller than one . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that the stability of the typical spatio - temporal structures found in dpa such as the chessboard configuration are more stable for the bidirectional case and the opposite in the other side , i.e.e , units synchronize faster .    </S>",
    "<S> the generalization to an arbitrary number of oscillators is a technical matter that follows the same steps discussed in dpa . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the mathematical details will not be discussed here again . however , we want to stress that according to these results the physical scenario defined for a population with one - directional couplings still holds . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillators synchronize due to a mechanism of dimensional reduction . </S>",
    "<S> however , let us remark an important difference respect to the previous case . in the bidirectional case </S>",
    "<S> one can not ensure that two units firing at unison in a given cycle will do it again in the next one , however it can be ensured through simple algebra that the number of synchronized oscillators can not decrease at any time , in other words , if a couple break their mutual synchrony necessarily one of the elements of this couple will synchronize with the other neighbor . </S>",
    "<S> this fact shows that the term dimensional reduction is more appropriate than the word absorption used currently in the literature . on the other hand , in the typical inhibitory patterns the oscillators tend to be as far as possible from the nearest neighbors .    as a complement of the previous studies </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the time required to reach fully synchronization for the bidirectional case . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we have focused our attention in two particular situations . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that for only two oscillators the maximal time needed to find both moving in synchrony is when in the initial condition the units are separated each other by @xmath30 , i.e.e when they are separated as far as possible . </S>",
    "<S> we wanted to check whether such phenomenon is also observed for larger populations . to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we have assumed that the oscillators are distributed randomly in a interval @xmath31 $ ] where @xmath32 is a variable quantity . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the results for different coupling strengths @xmath7 averaged over 200 samples . as we can see the randomization breaks the singular character of @xmath30 and the time grows monotonically with the width of the interval .    we have also studied for a fixed interval and for a fixed number of elements how depend the synchronization time with the magnitude of the coupling . in the mean - field case </S>",
    "<S> it was shown [ strogatz et al . , </S>",
    "<S> 1990 ] that the functional dependence goes as @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows our results for the bidirectional case . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to see that the same relationship between both variables still holds for short range couplings .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied under which conditions a population of pulse - coupled oscillators with bidirectional interactions display either synchronization or spatio - temporal structures . </S>",
    "<S> we have followed the mathematical formalism developed in dpa for a simpler case , noticing that the physical mechanisms underlying both phenomena are the same ( dimensional reduction ) as in the one - directional situation . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the time required to get synchronization observing the same functional dependence in the coupling found for the mean - field approach .    </S>",
