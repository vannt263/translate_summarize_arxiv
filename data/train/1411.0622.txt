    "estimation of covariance matrices is a crucial component of many signal processing algorithms [ 1 - 4 ] . in many applications ,",
    "there is a limited number of snapshots and the sample covariance matrix can not yield the desired estimation accuracy .",
    "this covariance matrix estimation error significantly degrades the performance of such algorithms . in some applications ,",
    "the true covariance matrix has a specific structure .",
    "for example , the array covariance matrix of a linear array with equally spaced antenna elements is a toeplitz matrix when the sources are uncorrelated [ 5 , 6 ] .",
    "moreover , in some applications [ 4 , 8 ] , the structure of the problem suggests that the underlying true covariance matrix is the kronecker product of two valid covariance matrices [ 4 , 7 ] .",
    "this side information can be leveraged in covariance matrix estimation to improve the estimation quality .",
    "for instance , in [ 5 ] a weighted least square estimator for covariance matrices with toeplitz structures was proposed and it was shown that the resulting covariance matrix can enhance the performance of angle estimation algorithms , such as multiple signals classification ( music ) [ 13 ] . in [ 8 ] , covariance matrices with kronecker structure are investigated and a maximum likelihood based algorithm is introduced .",
    "in addition , the structure of covariance matrices has been exploited in various doa estimation algorithms , such as the linear structure in [ 9 ] , and the diagonal structure for the covariance matrix of uncorrelated signals in [ 10 ] .",
    "recently some research works have focused on the application of sparse signal processing in doa estimation based on the sparse representation of the array covariance matrix .",
    "for example , [ 11 ] proposes the idea that the eigenvectors of the array covariance matrix have a sparse representation over a dictionary constructed from the steering vectors . in",
    "[ 12 , 14 ] , it is shown that when the received signals are uncorrelated , the array covariance matrix has a sparse representation over a dictionary constructed using the atoms , i.e. the correlation vectors .",
    "a similar idea is proposed in [ 15 ] , with the difference that the proposed method does not require choosing a hyper - parameter .    in this paper , we focus on the estimation of array covariance matrices with linear structure .",
    "first , we show that when the sources are uncorrelated , the array covariance matrix has a linear structure implying that all possible array covariance matrices can be described by a specific subspace . based on this idea ,",
    "a subspace - based covariance matrix estimator is proposed as a solution to a semi - definite convex optimization problem .",
    "furthermore , we propose a nearly optimal closed - form solution for the proposed covariance matrix estimator .",
    "our results show that the proposed method can noticeably improve the covariance matrix estimation quality .",
    "moreover , the closed - form solution is shown to closely approach the optimal performance .",
    "the system model under consideration is a narrowband array system with @xmath0 antennas .",
    "all the signals are assumed to be narrowband with the same center frequency and impinge on the array from the far field .",
    "the baseband array output can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3 array output vector , @xmath4 is the number of the received signals , @xmath5 is the @xmath6 signal , @xmath7 is the elevation and azimuth arrival angle of the @xmath6 signal , @xmath8 is the baseband array response to @xmath6 signal and * n*(t ) is the noise vector . the baseband array response , @xmath8 , is called the `` steering vector '' [ 13 ] .    if the received signals are uncorrelated , the covariance matrix can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the power of the @xmath6 signal , @xmath11 is the noise variance and @xmath12 is the identity matrix .",
    "we define the `` correlation vector '' which belongs to direction @xmath13 as follows @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a linear transformation that converts its matrix argument to a vector by stacking the columns of the matrix on top of one another .",
    "consequently , the covariance matrix can be rewritten as @xmath16 therefore , @xmath17 is a linear combination of the correlation vectors of the received signals .    according to ( 4 )",
    ", @xmath17 lies in the subspace of the correlation vectors .",
    "hence , if we build the subspace spanned by all possible correlation vectors@xmath18 , then @xmath17 completely lies in this subspace . for many array structures ,",
    "the matrix @xmath19 inherits some symmetry properties .",
    "accordingly , the correlation vectors can not span an @xmath20 dimensional space .",
    "for example , when the incoming signals are uncorrelated , the covariance matrix of a uniform linear array is a toeplitz matrix [ 5 ] .",
    "it is easy to show that all the @xmath21 toeplitz matrices can be described by a @xmath22 dimensional space .",
    "the subspace of the correlation vectors @xmath23 can be obtained by constructing a positive definite matrix @xmath24 where ( 5 ) is an element - wise integral .",
    "based on ( 5 ) , the subspace dimension of the correlation vectors @xmath25 is equal to the number of non - zero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the subspace of the correlation vectors can be constructed using the eigenvectors which correspond to the non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "1 shows the eigenvalues of @xmath26 for a square planar array with 16 elements ( the horizontal and vertical space between the elements is half a wavelength ) .",
    "one can observe that the number of non - zero eigenvalues is equal to 49 .",
    "therefore , for this array , the subspace of the correlation vectors can be constructed from the 49 eigenvectors corresponding to the non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "note that for a 16-element linear array , we observe 31 non - zeros eigenvalues because the covariance matrix is a toeplitz matrix[5 ] .",
    "for some array structures such as circular array , we may not observe zero eigenvalues but our investigation has shown that the subspace of the correlation vectors can be effectively approximated using the dominant eigenvectors ( the eigenvectors corresponding to the dominant eigenvalues ) .        therefore , if we construct the matrix @xmath27 whose columns form a basis for the correlation vectors subspace",
    ", we can rewrite the covariance matrix as @xmath28 hence , we can choose the columns of @xmath27 as the eigenvectors corresponding to the non - zero eigenvalues ( or the dominant eigenvectors ) . by imposing the linear structure constraint ( 6 ) to the covariance matrix estimation problem , we can significantly improve the estimation quality . some works",
    "have studied covariance matrices with linear structures .",
    "for example , a weighted least - square estimator was proposed in [ 5 ] based on the linear structure for toeplitz covariance matrices .",
    "however , the toeplitz structure is restricted to linear arrays and the resulting matrix is not guaranteed to be positive definite .",
    "based on ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , the estimated covariance matrix should lie in the subspace spanned by the columns of @xmath27 .",
    "we are going to estimate @xmath29 which is defined as @xmath30 based on the previous discussion , we propose the following optimization problem @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sample covariance matrix and @xmath33 is the number of time samples . the matrix @xmath34 is the projection matrix on the subspace that is orthogonal to the subspace of the correlations vectors . as such , the first constraint in",
    "( 8) ensures that the resulting matrix lies in the correlations vectors subspace .",
    "the second constraint guarantees that the resulting matrix is positive definite . note that , ( 8) is a convex optimization problem and can be solved using standard tools from convex optimization .",
    "the proposed method imposes the linear structure using the subspace constraint .",
    "if the covariance matrix is toeplitz , the subspace constraint enforces the resulting matrix to be toeplitz .",
    "however , the proposed algorithm is not limited to toeplitz structures and can be used for any linear structure .    the sample covariance matrix ( 9 )",
    "can be expressed as @xmath35 the second term on the right hand side of ( 10 ) , @xmath36 , is the unwanted part ( estimation error ) which tends to zero if we have an infinite number of snapshots .",
    "the estimation error has some random behavior and can lie anywhere in the entire space . since the first constraint in ( 8) enforces the estimated matrix to lie in the correlation vectors subspace , it is expected to eliminate the component of estimation error which is not in this subspace .",
    "the dimension of the correlation vectors subspace is typically smaller than the entire space dimension @xmath37 .",
    "for example , for a 30-element uniform linear array , the dimension of the correlation vectors subspace is equal to 59 ; while the entire space dimension is 900 .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that the proposed method could yield a much better estimation performance in comparison to the sample covariance matrix ( 9 ) .      the proposed optimization problem ( 8) is an @xmath37 dimensional optimization problem .",
    "therefore , it may be hard to solve for large arrays . in this section",
    ", we derive a closed form near optimal solution which makes our method easy for practical implementation .    according to ( 4 ) , the covariance matrix should be in the correlation vectors subspace .",
    "we define @xmath38 and @xmath39 as follows @xmath40 thus , @xmath41 is orthogonal to the correlation vectors subspace and @xmath42 contains the desired part",
    ". therefore , we rewrite ( 8) as @xmath43 in the proposed estimator ( 8) , we placed the first constraint to suppress the estimation error which does not lie in the correlation vectors subspace . in ( 11 ) , we project the sample covariance matrix to the correlation vectors subspace .",
    "thus , we have eliminated the estimation error which does not lie in the correlation vectors subspace .",
    "accordingly , we simplify ( 13 ) as follows @xmath44 which has a simple closed form solution @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath42 , @xmath47 are the positive eigenvalues and @xmath48 are their corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "actually , we break the primary optimization problem ( 8) into two optimization problems .",
    "first , we find a matrix in the correlation vectors subspace which is most close to the sample covariance matrix and the resulting matrix is @xmath42 .",
    "in the second step , we find the closest positive semi - definite matrix to @xmath42 and the resulting matrix is given in ( 15 ) .",
    "in this section , we provide some simulation results to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach .",
    "the examples provided include doa estimation and subspace estimation , which underscores the flexibility of the proposed covariance matrix estimation approach for a broad range of applications .",
    "all the curves are based on the average of 500 independent runs .",
    "assume a uniform linear array with @xmath49 omnidirectional sensors spaced half a wavelength apart .",
    "for this array the correlation vectors subspace is a 19 dimensional space since the covariance matrix is toeplitz .",
    "the additive noise is modeled as a complex gaussian zero - mean spatially and temporally white process with identical variances in each array sensor . in this experiment",
    ", we compare the performance of music when used with the sample covariance matrix and with the proposed covariance matrix estimation method .",
    "we also compare its performance with the sparse covariance matrix representation method [ 14 , 12 ] and the sparse iterative covariance - based estimation approach ( spice ) [ 15 ] .",
    "we consider two uncorrelated sources located at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the direction orthogonal to the array line ) and both sources are transmitted with the same power .",
    "2 shows the probability of resolution ( the probability that the algorithm can distinguish these two sources ) versus the number of snapshots for one fixed sensor with @xmath53 db .",
    "it is clear that using the proposed method leads to significant improvement in performance in comparison to using the sample covariance matrix .",
    "spice [ 15 ] is an iterative algorithm , which is based on the sparse representation of the array covariance matrix and requires one matrix inversion in each iteration .",
    "one can see that this algorithm fails when we use 20 iterations , however , performs well with 1000 iterations .",
    "nevertheless , for practical purposes it is generally computationally prohibitive to perform 1000 matrix inversion operations .",
    "in addition , one can observe that the proposed near optimal solution to ( 8) yields a close performance to the optimal solution .",
    "3 displays the probability of resolution against @xmath54 for a fixed training size @xmath55 snapshots .",
    "roughly , the music algorithm based on the proposed method is 7 db better than the music algorithm based on the sample covariance matrix . in summary ,",
    "the proposed method yields notable and promising performance even with a small number of snapshots and at low snr regimes .",
    "furthermore , it is easily implementable using the proposed closed - form solution , which consists of a matrix multiplication and eigen - decomposition .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the estimation of the subspace of the received signals is an important task in many signal processing algorithms .",
    "for example , in the eigen - space based beamforming algorithm [ 3 ] , the subspace of the received signals is used to make the beamformer robust against the steering vector mismatch . in the music algorithm ,",
    "the subspace of the received signals is used to obtain the noise subspace [ 13 ] .",
    "the subspace of the received signals is usually estimated using the dominant eigenvectors of the estimated covariance matrix . in this simulation , we consider three uncorrelated sources located at @xmath56 , @xmath52 and @xmath57 and the sources are received with same signal to noise ratio . to investigate the accuracy of the subspace estimation , we define the distance between two subspaces as follows [ 16 ] : + given two matrices @xmath58,@xmath59 , the distance between the subspaces spanned by the columns of @xmath58 and @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are orthonormal bases of the spaces @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath66 is an orthonormal basis for the subspace which is orthogonal to @xmath64 and @xmath67 is an orthonormal basis for the subspace which is orthogonal to @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , @xmath68 denotes the spectral norm of matrix @xmath69 .",
    "4 displays the distance between the true signals subspace and the estimated one as a function of the number of snapshots for @xmath70 db .",
    "we construct the signal subspace using the first three eigenvectors .",
    "one can observe that the proposed method exhibits a better rate of convergence .",
    "in addition , the performance of the closed - form solution closely approaches the optimal solution .",
    "in this paper , a subspace method for array covariance matrix estimation was proposed .",
    "we have shown that when the received signals are uncorrelated , the covariance matrix lies in the subspace of the correlation vectors .",
    "based on this idea , we posed the estimation problem as a convex optimization problem and enforced a subspace constraint .",
    "in addition , a near optimal closed - form solution for the proposed optimization problem was derived .",
    "a number of numerical examples demonstrated the notable performance of the proposed approach and its applicability to a wide range of signal processing problems , including but not limited to , doa estimation and subspace estimation .",
    "in contrast to some of the existing approaches , which suffer from drastic performance degradation with limited data and at low snr regimes , the proposed method showed very graceful degradation in such settings .",
