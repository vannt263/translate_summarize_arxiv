    "this is a review of irrational conformal theory , a subject which has grown from the discovery @xcite of unitary conformal field theories ( cfts ) with irrational central charge .    more precisely , irrational conformal field theory ( icft )",
    "is defined to include all conformal field theories , and , in particular , icft includes rational conformal field theory ( rcft ) @xmath4 as a very small subspace ( see fig.[f11 ] ) .",
    "the central tool in the study of icft is the general affine - virasoro construction @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a conformal stress tensor and @xmath7 , @xmath8dim@xmath9 are the currents of a general affine lie algebra .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 is called the inverse inertia tensor of the icft , in analogy with the spinning top .",
    "the virasoro condition on @xmath6 is summarized by the virasoro master equation ( vme ) , which is a set of quadratic equations for the inverse inertia tensor .",
    "the solution space of the vme is called affine - virasoro space .",
    "this space contains the conventional rcfts ( which include the affine - sugawara and coset constructions ) and a vast array of new , generically - irrational conformal field theories .",
    "generic irrationality of the central charge ( even on positive integer level of affine compact lie algebras ) is a simple consequence of the quadratic nature of the vme , and , similarly , it is believed that the space of all unitary theories is dominated by irrational central charge .",
    "many candidates for new unitary rcfts , beyond the conventional rcfts , have also been found .",
    "a coarse - grained picture of affine - virasoro space is obtained by thinking in terms of the symmetry of the inverse inertia tensor in the spinning top analogy : the conventional rcfts are very special cases of relatively high symmetry , while the generic icft is completely asymmetric .",
    "many exact unitary solutions with irrational central charge have been found , beginning with the solutions of ref .",
    "more generally , the conformal field theories of affine - virasoro space have been partially classified , using graph theory @xcite and generalized graph theory @xcite .",

    "are the space - time metric and the antisymmetric tensor field on the target space .",
    "this action reduces to @xmath1567 when @xmath1664 , as it should .",
    "although the result ( [ sigma ] ) is an ordinary sigma model in tseytlin s ( 3.1 ) is taken as twice the high-@xmath406 projector @xmath399 , the two actions are the same except for a dilaton term and an overall minus sign for the kinetic term . ]",
    ", the derivation above highlights the fact that conformal invariance of a sigma model depends on the choice of the world - sheet metric ( the gravitational coupling ) and its associated stress tensor .",
    "the correct stress tensor ( [ sigstress ] ) of the @xmath105 theory followed from the unconventional coupling of the @xmath105 metric to the @xmath105 matter in ( [ sbb ] ) , but one may also consider the same sigma model ( [ sigma ] ) with the conventional choice @xcite , @xmath1665 of the world - sheet metric @xmath1666 and its associated conventional stress tensor @xmath1667 .",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath1667 is conformal invariant in this case , but the question is not directly relevant because @xmath1668 and @xmath1667 are not the world - sheet metric and stress tensor of the @xmath105 theory .",
