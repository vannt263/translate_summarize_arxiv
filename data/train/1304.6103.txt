    "the discovery of a new boson near 126 gev  @xcite that resembles the higgs boson of the standard model has stimulated considerable theoretical interpretation . in supersymmetric models ,",
    "the observed mass is particularly interesting . whereas 126 gev is compatible with expectations for the mass ( @xmath0 ) of the lightest neutral cp - even higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , large quantum corrections",
    "are indicated in order to raise @xmath0 to a value 40% above @xmath1  @xcite . in the next - to - minimal model ( nmssm ) ,",
    "an additional tree - level contribution may also boost the value of @xmath0 , but radiative effects are still necessary unless the tri - linear coupling of the singlet and doublet higgs fields in the superpotential is large  @xcite .",
    "thus the measured higgs mass provides an important clue to the parameters of the supersymmetric model .",
    "the program of precision calculations of the lightest higgs boson mass in the mssm began with one - loop results , given in  @xcite , followed by two - loop contributions given in  @xcite .",
    "partial three - loop results are now available  @xcite . in cases with a large hierarchy between the weak scale and the scale of the stop squarks",
    ", resummation has been used to obtain precise results , now at the level of three - loop @xmath2-functions in some cases  @xcite .",
    "residual theoretical uncertainty estimates vary depending on the type of calculation performed , but in the fixed - order case are perhaps of the order 1 gev for light spectra below a tev , and 2 - 3 gev for heavier spectra  @xcite .",
    "the utility of the computations described above rely on decoupling",
    "  very heavy states that do not receive their masses from electroweak symmetry breaking are expected to give negligible contribution to the lightest higgs mass .",
    "only a limited set of model parameters , which are in principle accessible at future collider experiments , are thought to be required for an accurate calculation of @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "if an inaccessible heavy sector could provide a significant contribution to @xmath0 , then only the size of this contribution could be constrained by comparing the measured @xmath0 to the calculation in terms of observable parameters .",
    "this would clearly be a much weaker position .",
    "recently , it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the seesaw - extended mssm @xcite , a right - handed neutrino and sneutrino provides an example of such a non - decoupling heavy sector , potentially shifting the mssm prediction for @xmath0 by as much as a few gev at one - loop order , even if the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking parameters remain at the tev scale .",
    "it was further argued that the large terms appear at order @xmath3 in the relevant two - point functions , which are invisible to effective potential estimates that are based on calculations performed at zero external momenta .",
    "are therefore quite distinct from corrections that have been found in certain parameter ranges of the nmssm with tev - scale right - handed neutrinos  @xcite . ]    in light of its importance for the interpretation of the observed higgs boson with @xmath4  gev , we have performed a reanalysis of the right - handed neutrino and sneutrino contributions to @xmath0 in the seesaw - extended mssm .",
    "we find that the corrections to @xmath0 due to physics at the seesaw scale are always minuscule , of the order of a billionth of an ev .",
    "this decoupling behavior is manifest in renormalization schemes in which the @xmath5 counterterm is completely insensitive to phenomena at scales well above the susy - breaking scale .",
    "one class of decoupling schemes includes physical schemes , where the @xmath5 counterterm is controlled , for example , by the radiative corrections to the mass of the heavy higgs boson , or by corrections to the decays of the heavy higgs bosons to down - type fermions .",
    "another class of decoupling schemes subtracts non - decoupling terms by hand , mocking up the behavior of minimal subtraction schemes where heavy particles are fully integrated out at their thresholds and are absent from the low - energy theory .",
    "if a non - decoupling renormalization scheme is employed in the definition of @xmath5 , then the decoupling of high - scale physics phenomena in the radiatively - corrected higgs mass is recovered once @xmath5 is directly related to a low - energy observable .",
    "that is , @xmath5 should be regarded as an intermediary quantity , which one is free to define in any scheme .",
    "independently of how one defines @xmath5 , the mssm higgs mass ultimately depends solely on parameters that can be fixed by experimental measurements at energy scales of order the susy - breaking scale and below .",
    "contributions to the higgs mass from energy scales significantly above the susy - breaking scale must be negligible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the computation of the physical masses of the neutral cp - even higgs bosons in the mssm at one - loop order .",
    "we provide compact formulae and discuss the role of @xmath5 renormalization in the results . in section 3",
    "we calculate the leading contributions to the lightest higgs boson mass from the left and right handed neutrino / sneutrino sectors .",
    "we reduce the full diagrammatic result of ref .",
    "@xcite to simple , approximate analytic formulae in two different renormalization schemes , and find that in both cases the right - handed neutrino sector exhibits appropriate decoupling .",
    "we provide an interpretation of our approximate formulae in the more natural setting of effective field theory . finally , we study the full one - loop results numerically , finding again that contributions from the right - handed neutrino sector are negligible .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "explicit expressions for self - energy functions , tadpoles and the @xmath5 counterterm , which can provide potential non - decoupling contributions in the computation of the higgs mass , are exhibited in appendix a. using these approximate forms , one can check that the non - decoupling terms cancel exactly in the expressions for the one - loop radiatively - corrected higgs mass when a suitable definition of the @xmath5 counterterm is employed .",

    "this subtraction scheme also removes additional contributions that depend on the low - energy sectors ( without affecting the decoupling behavior of the scheme ) .",
    "in fact , this is reminiscent of the on - shell scheme ( the definition of which does not involve the limit @xmath89 ) which was observed in ref .  @xcite to respect decoupling , but was discarded in favor of the m@xmath85 scheme , as the latter was deemed to be more numerically stable .",
    "we emphasize that even with a scheme ( such as the dec scheme ) that is not directly related to any particular physical measurement , decoupling is preserved if the effects of the heavy sector that do not vanish in the large mass limit are fully removed by hand .",
    "in particular this is how effective field theory analysis should be performed in mass - independent schemes  @xcite .    another possibility is to demand that some physical ( measurable ) quantity is given at one - loop order by its tree - level formula .",
    "two such quantities are the mass @xmath56 and the decay rate @xmath90 . in the former case [ denoted as the  higgsmass \" ( hm ) scheme ] , the @xmath5 counterterm is obtained by setting @xmath91 in eq .",

    "@xcite . in this reference , the authors do not emphasize decoupling properties , but exhibit other flaws among all available schemes .",
    "for example , @xmath85 is gauge - dependent at one - loop , the hm scheme can lead to large perturbative corrections and numerical instability , and using @xmath90 is both technically complicated and introduces flavor dependence into @xmath5 . for our purposes of exhibiting decoupling in the next section , we will use the dec and hm schemes as examples .",

    "nevertheless , our conclusions should not be affected by the presence of additional generations of right - handed neutrinos and sneutrinos .",
    "we expect that the right - handed neutrino and sneutrino contributions to the physical higgs masses should decouple as the majorana mass scale becomes much larger than the soft supersymmetry breaking scales , if all other parameters are held fixed .",

    "indeed it is well known that the corrections to the tree - level higgs mass relations in the mssm are due entirely to susy - breaking effects .",

    "we have reanalyzed the radiative corrections to the higgs mass from the right - handed neutrino sector .    in the analysis presented in this work",
    ", we began with a review of the computation of one - loop corrections to the physical masses of the neutral higgs bosons of the mssm , streamlining the derivation , providing compact general formulae for the spectrum , and reviewing the decoupling properties of various @xmath5 renormalization schemes . in our consideration of the relevance of decoupling",
    ", we distinguished two cases .",
    "first , we commented briefly on the possibility that @xmath5 can not be independently measured in any scheme .",
    "for example , this could occur simply because all mssm degrees of freedom are too heavy , in which case the decoupling properties of the scheme used to define @xmath5 are irrelevant . however , the corresponding mssm higgs mass prediction can not be tested , and the most that can be achieved is a scheme - dependent constraint on the superpartner mass scale and @xmath5 . much more relevant for phenomenology is the alternative case , where some mssm particles with @xmath5-sensitive couplings can be accessed in collider experiments . in this latter case",
    ", one can predict the masses of the mssm higgs bosons in terms of quantities that are directly accessible to experimental measurements .",
    "these predicted masses are completely insensitive to physics at mass scales significantly larger than the scale of susy - breaking ( such as the high - scale seesaw sector employed in a theory of neutrino masses ) .",
    "consequently , it is especially convenient to define the parameter @xmath5 using a renormalization scheme that respects decoupling , since the expressions for the mssm higgs masses ( which depend explicitly on @xmath5 ) will then manifestly exhibit the expected decoupling behavior .    applying the general mass formulae to the right - handed neutrino sector",
    ", we derived expressions for the leading contributions in two decoupling schemes , and found that the magnitude of the corrections to the higgs mass are utterly negligible . the expected decoupling behavior is observed if the right - handed neutrino mass scale is taken large while other input parameters are held fixed .",
    "the structure of the leading correction terms is easily recovered from effective field theory arguments .",
    "finally , to go beyond the approximate formulae , we performed a numerical analysis including all contributing one - loop terms .",
    "we find that the corrections remain negligible and are well - reproduced by the leading terms .",
    "since all the relevant couplings are weak , it is sufficient to work to one - loop order . in particular ,",
    "the effective field theory analysis gives us confidence that our results will not change with the inclusion of two - loop and higher - order effects .",

    "<S> recently , it has been argued that in the supersymmetric extension of the seesaw - extended standard model , heavy right - handed neutrinos and sneutrinos may give corrections as large as a few gev to the mass of the lightest neutral cp - even higgs boson , even if the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters are of order the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such large corrections would render precise higgs masses incalculable from measurable low - energy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is not the case : decoupling is preserved in the appropriate sense and right - handed ( s)neutrinos , if they exist , have negligible impact on the physical higgs masses . </S>"
