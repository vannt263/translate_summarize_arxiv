    "in recent work @xcite , we considered neutrino production for two leading scenarios for the sources that power long - duration grbs , namely the collapsar @xcite and supranova ( sa ) @xcite models . in the collapsar model ,",
    "the core of a massive star collapses directly to a black hole , and the most important radiation field for photomeson neutrino production is the internal synchrotron radiation field @xcite . in the supranova ( sa ) model ,",
    "a pulsar nebula synchrotron radiation within an expanding supernova remnant ( snr ) shell @xcite provides additional external photon target for photomeson interactions ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we found that the presence of the external field in the sa model can increase the number of detectable neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more over the collapsar model when the doppler factor @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath5 , the internal synchrotron field can become effective for photomeson interactions . in our calculations , we assumed that the energy injected in protons is equal to the energy of electrons producing the photon fluence measured at x - ray and @xmath0-ray energies . in both models ,",
    "the likelihood of detecting a neutrino from a grb with a km - scale detector such as icecube is small except for rare grbs with fluence @xmath6 .",
    "if grb blast waves are strongly baryon - loaded , however , as required in a grb model for high - energy cosmic rays @xcite , then we predict that 100 tev ",
    "100 pev neutrinos will be detected several times per year with icecube when @xmath5 .",
    "here we summarize our calculations of photomeson neutrino production for the collapsar and sa models , and present new calculations for the hadronic cascade radiation from a grb .",
    "the grb model is adapted from our photo - hadronic model for blazar jets @xcite , and takes into account the injection of nonthermal protons which lose energy through photomeson interactions .",
    "protons are injected with a number spectrum @xmath7 at comoving proton energies @xmath8 gev up to a maximum proton energy determined by the condition that the particle larmor radius is smaller than both the size scale of the emitting region and the photomeson energy - loss length . here",
    "@xmath9 is the lorentz factor of the blast wave . the observed synchrotron spectral flux in the prompt phase of the burst is parameterized by the expression @xmath10 , where @xmath11 kev , @xmath12 above @xmath13 and an exponential cutoff at 10 mev , and @xmath14 when @xmath15 .",
    "at lower energies , @xmath16 . the observed total hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray photon fluence @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the characteristic duration of the grb .",
    "we consider a source at redshift @xmath19 and take the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray fluence @xmath20 .",
    "two or three grbs should occur each month above this fluence level .",
    "a total amount of energy @xmath21 is injected in the form of accelerated proton energy into the comoving frame of the grb blast wave . here",
    "@xmath22 is the redshift and @xmath23 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the energy deposited into each of @xmath24 light - curve pulses ( or spikes ) is therefore @xmath25 ergs .",
    "we assume that all the energy @xmath26 is injected in the first half of the time interval of the pulse ( to ensure variability in the grb light curve ) , which effectively corresponds to a characteristic variability time scale @xmath27 .",
    "the proper width of the radiating region forming the pulse is @xmath28 , from which the energy density of the synchrotron radiation can be determined @xcite .",
    "we set the grb prompt duration @xmath29s , and let @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "the magnetic field is determined by assuming equipartition between the energy densities of the magnetic field and the electron energy .    for the sa model",
    ", we assume the existence of an external radiation field given by the expression @xmath32 , with @xmath33 kev @xcite .",
    "the intensity of this field is determined by the assumption that the integral power @xmath34 is equal to the power of the pulsar wind @xmath35 , assuming that a total of @xmath36 of pulsar rotation energy is radiated during the time @xmath37 ( which is here set equal to 0.1 yr ) from the rotating supramassive neutron star before it collapses to a black hole .",
    "the energy @xmath38 is the characteristic energy of synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons ( of the pulsar wind ) with lorentz factors @xmath39 in a randomly ordered magnetic field of strength @xmath40 g. the radius @xmath41 is determined by assuming that @xmath42 is the mean speed of the snr shell , and that the external photon energy density @xmath43 .",
    "1 shows the total @xmath2 fluences expected from a model grb with @xmath44 pulses .",
    "the thin curves show collapsar model results at @xmath45 200 , and 300 , with @xmath46 .",
    "the expected numbers of @xmath2 that a km - scale detector such as icecube would detect are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "there is no prospect to detect @xmath2 from grbs at these levels .",
    "the heavy solid and dashed curves in fig .  1 give the sa model predictions of @xmath50 for both @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the equipartition magnetic fields are 1.9 kg and 0.25 kg , respectively .",
    "the external radiation field in the sa model makes the neutrino detection rate insensitive to the value of @xmath53 ( as well as to @xmath54 , as verified by calculations ) , but there is still little hope that a km@xmath55 detector could detect such grbs .",
    "neutrino production efficiency would improve by at most a factor of 3 in the collapsar model if @xmath56ms ( and @xmath57 to provide the same total fluence ) .",
    "such narrow spikes are , however , then nearly opaque to @xmath0 rays with energies @xmath58 mev @xcite . even in this case , there is little hope to detect neutrinos except from rare grbs with fluence @xmath59 .     for a model grb with hard x - ray fluence @xmath60 for different doppler factors @xmath53 .",
    "the thin curves show collapsar model results where only the internal synchrotron radiation field provides a source of target photons . ]",
    "2 shows new calculations of photomeson neutrino production for a grb with @xmath61 and @xmath51 , as well as the accompanying electromagnetic radiation induced by pair - photon cascades from the secondary electrons and @xmath0 rays from the same photomeson interactions .",
    "the total number of @xmath2 expected with icecube is @xmath62 .",
    "the total fluence of cascade photons shown here is contributed by lepton synchrotron ( dot - dashed ) and compton ( dashed ) emissions . for comparison ,",
    "the dotted curve shows the primary lepton synchrotron radiation spectrum assumed for the calculations .",
    "the level of the fluence of the cascade photons is @xmath40% of the primary synchrotron radiation .",
    "this means that the maximum allowed baryon loading for these parameters can not exceed a factor of @xmath63 in order not to overproduce the primary synchrotron radiation fluence .",
    "this limits the maximum number of @xmath2 to @xmath64 even in the case of large baryon loading for rare , powerful grbs .",
    "these numbers can not be further increased in the sa model because of the efficient extraction that is already provided by internal photons alone for these parameters .     and @xmath51 .",
    "the dotted curve shows the fluence of a grb used for calculations , and the dashed and dot - dashed curves show the compton and synchrotron contributions to the photon fluence from the electromagnetic cascade initiated by secondaries from photomeson processes , respectively . , width=415 ]    in conclusion , we predict that at most a few high - energy @xmath2 can be detected with icecube even from a very bright grb at the fluence level @xmath65 , and only when the baryon loading is high @xcite .",
    "this is because the detection of a single @xmath2 requires a @xmath2 fluence @xmath66 above 1 tev .",
    "since the energy release in high - energy neutrinos and electromagnetic secondaries is about equal , this energy will be reprocessed in the pair - photon cascade and emerge in the form of observable radiation at hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray energies , and this radiation can not exceed the measured fluence in this regime .",
    "this imposes a robust limit on the maximum number of @xmath2 even from a grb with very high baryon loading .",
