    "the standard model ( sm ) has been very successful phenomenologically . despite its success ,",
    "the sm is still believed to be a theory effective at the electroweak scale and that some new physics must exist at higher energy regimes .",
    "so far there have been numerous speculations on the possible forms of new physics beyond the sm . in the effective lagrangian approach @xcite ,",
    "the observable effects of new physics at the sm energy scale are described in the form of anomalous interactions . among the various candidates for new physics which have predictive power at energies not far above the weak scale ,",
    "the most intensively studied one is the weak - scale minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm)@xcite , which has many attractive features and is often arguably the most promising one .    in the mssm",
    ", the invariance of @xmath2-parity , defined by @xmath9 for a field with spin @xmath10 , baryon - number @xmath11 and lepton - number @xmath12 , is often imposed on the lagrangian in order to maintain the separate conservation of baryon - number and lepton - number . however",
    ", this conservation is not dictated by any fundamental principle such as gauge invariance and there is no compelling theoretical motivation for it .",
    "the most general superpotential of the mssm consistent with the @xmath13 symmetry and supersymmetry contains @xmath2-violating interactions which are given by  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the left - handed lepton ( quark ) doublet and right - handed lepton ( quark ) singlet chiral superfields .",
    "@xmath17 are generation indices and @xmath18 denotes charge conjugation .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the color indices and @xmath22 is the total antisymmetric tensor .",
    "@xmath23 are the higgs - doublets chiral superfields .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath12-violating couplings , @xmath26 @xmath11-violating couplings .",
    "@xmath24 is antisymmetric in the first two indices and @xmath26 is antisymmetric in the last two indices .",
    "the phenomenological studies for these @xmath2-violating couplings were started long time ago@xcite . while this is an interesting problem in its own right , the recent anomalous events at hera @xcite and the evidence of neutrino oscillation @xcite might provide an additional motivation for the study of these @xmath2-violating couplings . so both theorists and experimentalists have recently intensively examined the phenomenology of @xmath2-parity breaking supersymmetry in various processes@xcite and obtained some bounds@xcite .",
    "it is notable that some of these @xmath2-violating couplings contribute to the precisely measured @xmath1 and @xmath0 couplings through sfermion - fermion loops .",
    "since the mssm is a renormalizable field theory and the sparticles get their masses through explicit soft breaking terms , the decoupling theorem @xcite implies that the effects of these sparticle loops will be suppressed by some orders of @xmath27 and vanish as @xmath28 goes far above the weak scale .",
    "so , in general , these sfermion - fermion loop effects on lower energy observables are small",
    ". however , due to the non - decoupling property of heavy sm particles ( which get masses through spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking ) , the effects of the sfermion - fermion loops with the fermion being the top quark ( hereafter called the top quark loops ) may be enhanced by the large top quark mass .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2-violating top quark couplings in eq.([poten ] ) , @xmath3 and @xmath29 , which currently subject to quite weak bounds ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , may give rise to significant contributions through the top quark loops .",

    "note that at the level of the superpotential , the explicit @xmath12-violating terms @xmath32 can be rotated away by a field redefinition@xcite .",
    "however , such a redefinition does not leave the full lagrangian invariant when including the soft - breaking terms@xcite .",

    "we would like to make a few comments on the above calculations :    * in our calculations , we used dimensional regularization to control the ultraviolet divergences in the virtual loop corrections and we adopted the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences in the self - energy and the vertex loops are contained in feynman integrals .",
    "we have checked that in our results , the ultraviolet divergences cancelled as a result of renormalizability of the mssm . * in our calculations , various sfermion states are involved .",
    "we note that in general there exist the mixing between left- and right - handed sfermions of each flavor ( denoted as @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) , as suggested by low - energy supergravity models @xcite .",
    "( we do not consider the flavor mixing of sfermions . )",
    "so @xmath82 and @xmath83 are in general not the physical states ( mass eigenstates ) , instead they are related to mass eigenstates @xmath84 and @xmath85 by a unitary rotation : @xmath86 in our calculations , we give the results in terms of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which can be easily applied to the general case by using the above relations between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "* we neglected the @xmath2-conserving mssm contribution to @xmath0 couplings because they are expected to be small , unlike the @xmath89 case where chargino - stop loops could contribute significantly . *",
    "while it is theoretically possible to have both @xmath11-violating and @xmath12-violating terms in the lagrangian , the non - observation of proton decay imposes very stringent conditions on their simultaneous presence . in our calculation",
    "( and in the following numerical calculations ) we consider the presence of one non - zero coupling at one time .",
    "let us neglect the mixing between the left- and right - handed sfermions of each flavor , and assume the value of 100 gev for all sparticles and find out which coupling could give large contribution .",
    "( for heavier sparticles the contribution becomes smaller . ) the top quark mass is fixed to @xmath90 gev throughout the paper .",
    "the results are found to be @xmath91 as expected , even for the same magnitudes of the coupling strength , the top quark interactions contribute more significantly than others , i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath92 contribute more significantly to @xmath40 , while @xmath3 to @xmath93 . in each case , the dominant contribution is found to arise from the top quark loops .    as for the contribution from @xmath2-conserving mssm , for comparison ,",
    "we assume @xmath94 ( i.e. , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , and the masses of both stops take the value of 100 gev . assuming @xmath97 gev and @xmath98 gev , then for @xmath99 , the contributions are found to be @xmath100 as expected , @xmath101 is large because it is proportional to @xmath45 . for large @xmath48 , @xmath58 also becomes sizable because it is enhanced by the factor @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 arise from the gauge coupling and is found to be always small .",
    "we realize that although the magnitude of @xmath58 becomes comparable to that of @xmath101 for large @xmath48 , its contribution to @xmath6 is suppressed by the factor @xmath104 relative to the contribution of @xmath101 .",
    "so , for low and intermediate @xmath48 , the mssm contribution is dominated by the last three diagrams of fig.1 , which are induced by the @xmath44higgsino yukawa coupling .",
    "since the sign of @xmath58 is opposite to that of @xmath101 , the mssm contribution to @xmath6 is relatively large when @xmath105 is the lighter stop @xmath106 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath48 takes the small value and the lighter chargino is higgsino - like .    comparing eqs.([result1],[result2 ] ) with eqs.([mssm3 ] ) , we find that for @xmath107 or @xmath108 the @xmath2-violating contribution to @xmath6 is of comparable magnitude to the mssm contribution .",
    "( here again we note the fact that the contribution of @xmath42 to @xmath6 is suppressed by the factor @xmath104 relative to the contribution of @xmath41 . ) if the stops are significantly lighter than other sfermions which appear in the top quark loops of @xmath2-violating contributions , the mssm contribution to @xmath6 can be more sizable .",
    "so the mssm contributions should be considered when deriving the bounds on @xmath2-violating couplings from @xmath6 .",
    "from the results of the preceding section , we found that the contributions of @xmath2-violating top quark interactions to both @xmath1 and @xmath0 could be significant , with the dominant contributions arising from the top quark loops .",
    "the magnitudes of the contributions are proportional to the relevant coupling strenth squared .    for the @xmath12-violating top quark couplings @xmath3 , only @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111",

    ", none of them have been well constrained by other processes .",
    "some theoretical bounds on @xmath4 can be derived under specific assumptions .",
    "the constraint of perturbative unitarity at the susy breaking scale @xmath28 would require all the couplings @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 .",
    "a stronger bound can be obtained if we assume the gauge group unification at @xmath116 gev and the yukawa couplings @xmath117 and @xmath118 to remain in the perturbative domain in the whole range up to @xmath119 .",
    "they imply @xmath120 for @xmath121 gev .",
    "then we obtain an upper bound of 1.25 for all @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "so it is likely for these top quark @xmath2-violating couplings , subject to the current limits , cause large effects on @xmath6 and/or @xmath5 and , as a result , their current bounds could be improved further .    in the following",
    "we present some representative results . for simplicity",

    "the lighter chargino mass is 112 gev for @xmath126 and 92 gev for @xmath127 .",
    "( note that the lower bound of 91 gev on the chargino mass was obtained from the lep runs at c.m .",
    "energy of 183 gev@xcite . )",
    "the coupling @xmath4 ( @xmath128 or @xmath129 ) contributes to both @xmath130 though the @xmath131 loops and @xmath132 through @xmath133 loops .",
    "if we assume the mass degeneracy between @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and neglect the masses of the final quark states , then the contribution to @xmath6 is given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 given in the appendix . the mssm contribution to @xmath6",

    "so the perturbative unitarity bound of 1.25 on @xmath4 can not be improved at @xmath7 level , but can be improved at @xmath8 level .",
    "the limits on @xmath4 are listed in table [ table_1 ] .",

    "however , the contribution of @xmath41 to @xmath6 is of comparable magnitude to that of @xmath42 due to the suppression factor @xmath104 for the latter .",

    "we note that the limits are not very sensitive to @xmath48 in the range of @xmath181 .",
    "this is because the @xmath2-conserving mssm effects are dominated by the @xmath44higgsino yukawa coupling squared @xmath182 which is not sensitive to @xmath48 in the range of intermediate and large @xmath48 .",
    "( of course , the mssm effects also have a mild dependence on @xmath48 through chargino masses and the unitary matrice diagonalising the chargino mass matrix . )",
    "it is obvious that as @xmath48 goes lower than 1 ( which is disfavored by the existing experimental data ) , the mssm effects will be greatly enhanced and thus the results will be very sensitive to @xmath48 . * for the mssm contribution to @xmath33 vertex , we only considered the most important part , i.e. , the chargino - stop loops .",
    "since the chargino - stop loops contain the large @xmath44higgsino yukawa coupling squared , which is proportional to @xmath45 , they are the dominant mssm effects in a large part of susy parameter space , typically with low or intermediate @xmath48 ( @xmath50 ) . for a very light cp - odd higgs boson @xmath46 ( @xmath47 gev ) and very large @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , the higgs loops may give rise to sizable effects .",
    "for very large @xmath48 and light sbottoms , the contribution from the neutralino - sbottom loops may also be sizable . in both cases ,",
    "the contributions to @xmath6 are positive ( adds to the effects of chargino - stop loops ) , and therefore , the bounds will get weaker for @xmath4 and stronger for @xmath3 . * we would like to elaborate again on the effects of sfermion mixings . in our numerical calculations",
    ", we neglected the mixing between the left- and right - handed sfermion states for each flavor , and further assume the mass degeneracy for all sfermions .",
    "this might be a good approximation for all sfermions except stops and sbottoms , because the mixing is proportional to the corresponding fermion mass@xcite .",
    "the non - diagonal element is give by@xcite @xmath183 for stop mass matrix and @xmath184 , with @xmath185 and @xmath186 being the coefficients of the trilinear soft susy - breaking terms @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "so in general the stop mixing is significant and sbottom mixing can also be significant for large @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that the lighter stop ( @xmath106 ) or / and the lighter sbottom ( @xmath189 ) could be significantly lighter than other sfermions .",
    "signal of stop and obtained the lower mass limit of 90 gev @xcite .",
    "however , we should note these bounds may not be applicable to the @xmath2-violating mssm since the lsp is no longer stable and thus the basic susy signal is no longer the missing energy . ]",
    "the stop @xmath106 is involved in fig.1 and the sbottom @xmath189 is involved in fig.5 with @xmath190 .",
    "so if the lighter stop is significantly lighter than other sfermions , the mssm contributions from fig.1 will be more significant and thus the limits get weaker for @xmath4 and stronger for @xmath3 ; if the lighter sbottom is significantly lighter than other sfermions ( e.g. , in case of very large @xmath48 ) , the couplings @xmath3 will have larger effects on @xmath0 vertex and thus subject to even stronger bounds .",
    "the numerical results we presented correspond to the special case @xmath191 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) . * in our numerical calculation we worked in the general mssm , where the susy parameters are arbitrary at the weak scale and thus we have the full parameter space freedom .",
