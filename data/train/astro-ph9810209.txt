    "close x - ray selected bl lacs ( xbls ) are sources of very high energy ( vhe ) gamma rays at energies above 300 gev .",
    "the bl lac first detected as a source of vhe gamma rays was mrk 421 ( @xcite ) , following its discovery as a gev source by the egret experiment on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "mrk 421 has been extensively monitored in vhe gamma rays and exhibits complex behaviour , having a low - level quiescent state with flaring on time scales as short as 30 minutes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "mrk 501 is also a source of vhe gamma rays ( @xcite ) , although not detected at gev energies with egret , and also exhibits low - level emission with flaring ( @xcite ) . in 1997",
    ", extremely strong outbursts of tev emission were detected lasting several months ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) the bl lac 1es 2344 + 514 also emits vhe gamma rays , most of the evidence for emission coming from a single outburst ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all of these objects are close ( @xmath3 ) , x - ray selected bl lacs . there have been no reported detections of vhe gamma rays from radio - selected bl lacs ( rbls  see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) although this category of object is frequently detected at gev energies by the egret experiment .",
    "@xcite have interpreted the gamma ray results in the gev ",
    "tev range and propose a model in which rbls will be gev gamma ray sources and xbls will be tev sources .",
    "they associate the emission of tev @xmath4-rays from xbls with the presence of relativistic electrons with energies higher than those in rbls .",
    "they then go on to show that a simple synchrotron self - compton model can explain the differences observed between rbls and xbls provided the attenuation of the vhe gamma ray flux by pair production with the intergalactic infrared background is taken into account ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the basis of this model , pks 2155304 , despite having a redshift of 0.117 , is predicted to be a strong tev gamma - ray source .",
    "the bl lac pks 2155304 was discovered as an x - ray source during observations made with the _",
    "satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) at a position where the _",
    "ariel  v _ satellite had previously detected confused emission ( @xcite ) . in many ways ,",
    "pks 2155304 may be regarded as the archetypal x - ray selected bl lac object ; like most bl lac objects it is associated with a compact , flat spectrum radio source and has an almost featureless continuum which extends from radio to x - ray energies .",
    "it is the brightest known bl lac at uv wavelengths , and the object s maximum power is emitted between the uv and the soft x - ray range ( @xcite ) .",
    "pks 2155304 has a history of rapid , strong broadband variability and has been the subject of several multiwavelength monitoring campaigns ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in 1997",
    "november , contemporaneous with some of the observations reported here , x - ray emission was detected with the _ beppo - sax _ satellite ( @xcite ) with a flux equal to the strongest previous outburst .",
    "the egret experiment on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ was used to detect 30 mev  10 gev gamma ray emission from pks 2155304 during 1994 november 15  29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations indicated a very hard spectrum , with an integral power - law spectral index of @xmath5 , and this , combined with its proximity , make it an excellent candidate tev source .",
    "however , a recent detailed analysis of the shape of the x - ray spectrum suggests that pks 2155304 may not be an important tev emitter , producing photons with a maximum energy of @xmath6 gev , although a very high degree of beaming may allow the production of photons with higher energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the absence of any signature of @xmath4-ray absorption due to pair production at energies up to 8 gev in observations of pks 2155304 is consistent with the suggestion that it contains a relativistic jet oriented nearly along our line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "the university of durham mark 6 atmospheric erenkov telescope has been in operation at narrabri , nsw , australia since july 1995 .",
    "the telescope is described in detail elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "it uses the well - established imaging technique to separate vhe gamma rays from the cosmic ray background , combined with a robust noise - free trigger based on the signals from three parabolic flux detectors of 7 m diameter and aperture f/1.0 mounted on a single alt - azimuth platform . a 109-element imaging camera ( @xmath7 pixel size ) is mounted at the focus of the central flux detector , with low resolution cameras each consisting of 19 pixels ( @xmath8 pixel size ) mounted at the focus of the outer ( left and right ) flux collectors .",
    "the telescope is triggered by demanding a simultaneous temporal ( 10 ns gate ) and spatial ( @xmath8 aperture ) coincidence of the erenkov light detected in the three cameras .",
    "this triggering system enables the telescope to detect low energy gamma rays with high immunity from triggering by local muons .",
    "initial work suggests that our system has a detection probability for gamma rays of about 1% at 100 gev with the probability of detection rising slowly to about 40% at 250 gev .",
    "the mark 6 telescope has been designed to provide stable operation which allows the observation of weak dc sources .",
    "the multiple - dish triggering system is stable against variations in performance due to accidental coincidences .",
    "all detector packages are thermally stabilised .",
    "the atmospheric clarity is continuously monitored both using a far infra - red radiometer and an axial optical ccd camera which enables the position and visual magnitude of guide stars to be monitored . the gain and noise performance of the pmts , digitizer pedestals and associated electronics are continuously monitored by :    1 .",
    "triggering the telescope at random times using a nitrogen laser / plastic scintillator / optical fibre light guide / opal diffuser system to simulate erenkov flashes and so enable flat - fielding , and 2 .   producing false triggers at random times to measure samples of the background noise .",
    "pks 2155304 was observed in 1996 september / october / november and 1997",
    "october / november under moonless , clear skies .",
    "the 1997 november observations were made as part of a multiwavelength campaign co - ordinated by t. vestrand .",
    "an observing log is shown in table [ observing_log ] .",
    "data were taken in 15-minute segments .",
    "off - source observations were taken by alternately observing regions of sky which differ by @xmath9 minutes in right ascension from the position of pks 2155304 to ensure that the on and off segments possess identical azimuth and zenith profiles .",
    "this off - source  on - source  on - source  off - source observing pattern is routinely used to eliminate any first order changes in count rate due to any residual secular changes in atmospheric clarity , temperature etc .",
    "the gross counting rate of the telescope was typically @xmath10 per minute near culmination ( zenith angle @xmath11 ) reducing to @xmath12 per minute at zenith angles of @xmath13 .",
    "most of the observations at large zenith angles were made in 1997 november , in order to maximize exposure during the multiwavelength campaign .",
    "detections of mrk 501 during its 1997 flaring activity using the mark 6 telescope at zenith angles of @xmath14 have demonstrated the usefulness of tev observations using the atmospheric erenkov technique at very large zenith angles ( @xcite ) .",

    "the strength of the @xmath4-ray emission is defined as the number of @xmath4-ray candidates ( shape and orientation selected events ) to the number of background protons during the same observation .",
    "this makes some allowance for variations in the sensitivity of our telescope as the zenith angle changes . using the test for constancy of emission used by the egret group ( @xcite )",
    ", the data suggest that the vhe @xmath4-ray emission is time variable . the largest excursion from the average flux occurred during observations in 1997 november .    the variation of the gamma - ray emission during observations made in individual nights is shown in figure [ day_to_day ] .",
    "we have no evidence for strong gamma - ray flaring on a time scale of days during these observations . however , the data suggest that the vhe gamma - ray emission is variable on a timescale of days , using the test of @xcite .",
    "pks 2155304 is the fourth x - ray emitting bl lac to be established as a vhe emitter and , thus far , the furthest from earth with a redshift of 0.117 .",
    "the emission shows the features of time variability demonstrated in the other bl lacs detected at vhe energies .    in figure [ spectrum ]",
    "we show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from pks 2155304 from radio to vhe gamma ray energies , including the present results .",
    "the present vhe result is consistent with the seds for the other vhe - emitting blazars .",
    "the vhe behaviour is in general agreement with the predictions of @xcite and , as for the other three established vhe blazars , indicates the success of the unified model of agns in explaining the gross features of vhe emission .",
    "however , the present vhe data are unable to distinguish between the predictions for the external compton or the synchrotron self - compton model , as is the case for tev observations of the other vhe blazars .    during our observations of pks 2155304 measurements of its 2  10 kev x - ray emission were available from the asm on _ rxte_. in figure [ xrays](a ) we show the correlation between the average vhe emission during each of the five months when data were available and the corresponding average x - ray rate from the _ rxte _ quick look analysis .",
    "the correlation coefficient for the data is 0.66 .",
    "a similar plot for the daily averaged tev and x - ray measurements are shown in figure [ xrays](b ) . in this case , the correlation coefficient is 0.22 .",
    "the data in figure [ xrays ] show evidence for a correlation between the strengths of vhe gamma ray emission and x - ray emission from pks 2155304 on timescales of both days and months . in particular , the observing periods during which we failed to detect significant vhe gamma - ray emission ( 1996 october and november )",
    "coincide with a period of low x - ray emission according to the _ rxte _ asm measurements .",
    "we also note that @xcite based their conclusions that pks 2155304 should not emit vhe gamma rays from an x - ray observation taken with _",
    "beppo - sax _ shortly after our 1996 november ( null ) observation .",
    "the general correlation between x - ray and vhe emission in pks 2155304 is in agreement with multiwavelength observations of mrk 421 and mrk 501 ( reviewed by e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these show such correlated behaviour , indicating that the same population of electrons produces the x - ray and tev emission ; this is the basis for many models for vhe production in agns .",
    "as has been pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , a detailed study of the temporal correlation between the x - rays and tev gamma - rays during flares can provide a test for beaming .",
    "however , none of the flaring activity observed in our observations of pks 2155304 is at a strength where meaningful limits can be placed on the contribution of beaming .",
    "the strongest vhe emission from pks 2155304 occurred in 1997 november ( during the multiwavelength campaign ) .",
    "we note that the strongest x - ray emission ever observed from this object was detected by _ beppo - sax _ during observations in 1997",
    "november 22  24 ( @xcite ) .",
    "egret also detected gev gamma - rays , again at a flux considerably higher than prevous detections , during an observation from 1997 november 11  17 , just before the onset of our november observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the 1997 november multiwavelength campaign will be reported elsewhere .",
    "our observations indicate that pks 2155304 emits vhe gamma rays at energies above about 300 gev and that the energy spectrum extends , with significance at the @xmath54 level , beyond 3 tev . the estimated average integral flux above a threshold of 300 gev is @xmath55 .",
    "observations of vhe gamma - rays from agns can be used to probe the inter - galactic infra - red radiation field ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent version of this model ( @xcite , @xcite ) uses estimates of the infra - red radiation field due to @xcite to predict the optical depth for tev sources as a function of distance .",
    "they predict an optical depth of 1  2 for an object emitting 3 tev gamma - rays at @xmath56 .",
    "our detection of @xmath53 tev gamma - rays from pks 2155304 is thus not in conflict with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "however , a more sensitive test must await a determination of the vhe gamma - ray spectrum from our data .",
