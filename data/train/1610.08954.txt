    "finite - temperature mean - field approximations , in particular the finite - temperature hartree - fock ( hf ) and hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximations  @xcite , are commonly used in the calculation of statistical properties of nuclei such as level densities  @xcite .",
    "these approximations are computationally efficient and therefore suitable for global studies of nuclear properties .",
    "the nucleus is a finite - size system .",
    "consequently , the appropriate ensemble to describe it is the canonical ensemble with fixed numbers of protons and neutrons .",
    "however , the finite - temperature hf and hfb approximations are formulated in the grand canonical ensemble through the variation of the grand thermodynamic potential .",
    "it is then necessary to carry out a reduction to the canonical ensemble to restore the correct proton and neutron numbers .",
    "this reduction is usually done by expressing the canonical partition function as an inverse laplace transform of the grand canonical partition function and evaluating this transform in the saddle - point approximation  @xcite .",
    "a recent benchmarking of the accuracy of finite - temperature mean - field approximations identified significant problems with this saddle - point approach  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the method breaks down when the particle - number fluctuations are small .",
    "this occurs in the hf approximation at low temperatures , and a better approximation in such a case is the discrete gaussian approximation introduced in ref .",
    "however , in the low - temperature limit of the hfb , both the saddle - point and the discrete gaussian approximations yield unphysical results .",
    "specifically , the approximate canonical entropy becomes negative .",
    "here we address the restoration of particle - number conservation using an exact particle - number projection  @xcite .",
    "particle - number projection can be combined with a mean - field approximation in two ways : ( i ) variation after projection ( vap ) , in which the variation to determine the mean - field solution is carried out in the projected subspace , and ( ii ) projection after variation ( pav ) , in which the projection operator is applied to the mean - field solution in the grand canonical ensemble . in principle",
    ", vap should result in a more accurate approximation .",
    "it has been formulated for the zero - temperature hfb  @xcite and applied to even - even nuclei  @xcite .",
    "vap has also been formulated at finite temperature in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approximation to calculate the pairing gaps in small model spaces  @xcite .",
    "however , finite - temperature vap requires the calculation of the entropy of the particle - number projected mean - field density operator .",
    "this is difficult to carry out in the presence of a pairing condensate since the density operator does not commute with the particle - number operator . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this method has not yet been applied to heavy nuclei at finite temperature .",
    "in contrast , particle - number projection after variation is feasible at finite temperature in both the hf and hfb approximations .",
    "a general formalism was presented in ref .",
    "an alternate but equivalent formalism was derived in ref .",
    "particle - number pav has also been applied at finite temperature in the context of the bcs approximation  @xcite . however , in the hfb case , the general formalism includes a sign ambiguity .",
    "moreover , there has been no systematic assessment of the accuracy of particle - number pav for heavy nuclei in finite - temperature mean - field theories .    in this article",
    ", we derive unambiguous expressions for particle - number pav for the hf and the hfb approximations and assess their accuracy numerically . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to particle - number pav as the particle - number projection ( pnp ) . in the hf approximation ,",
    "particle number is conserved and the pnp is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "however , the hfb approximation violates particle - number conservation at temperatures below the pairing transition for either protons or neutrons . assuming the hfb condensate is invariant under time - reversal symmetry , which is a property of most even - even nuclei , we derive a general formula for the pnp that is free of any sign ambiguity . from this general expression",
    ", we derive a simpler expression for the pnp in the bcs limit of the hfb approximation .",
    "we apply the pnp to even - even nuclei for three typical cases : ( i ) a strongly deformed nucleus with weak pairing ( @xmath0dy ) , ( ii ) a spherical nucleus with strong pairing ( @xmath1sm ) , and ( iii ) a transitional deformed nucleus with non - negligible pairing ( @xmath2sm ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we benchmark the pnp results against those of the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method  @xcite .",
    "the smmc results are exact up to a controllable statistical error associated with the monte carlo sampling .",
    "we also compare the pnp results with those of the discrete gaussian approximations used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which were shown to improve on the usual saddle - point approximation .",
    "we observe both a qualitative and quantitative improvement at low temperatures . in the hf case",
    ", the pnp entropy does not show the unphysical oscillations that develop in the discrete gaussian approximations .",
    "in the hfb case , the entropy in the pnp becomes negative at temperatures below the pairing transition , but its errors are less than those in the discrete gaussian approximations .",
    "ultimately , the pnp is limited by deficiencies associated with the broken symmetries of the mean - field approximations . in a deformed nucleus",
    ", the pnp results do not include the contributions of rotational bands , while in a nucleus with a strong pairing condensate , the pnp entropy becomes negative at low temperatures due to the intrinsic violation of particle - number conservation in the grand canonical theory .",

    "the intrinsic violation of particle - number conservation below the pairing transition temperature will necessarily lead to a negative ground - state value of the pnp canonical entropy .",
    "it is therefore desirable to explore improvements to finite - temperature mean - field theories that can address these issues .",
    "one avenue for improvement is the variation after projection ( vap ) method .",

    "in particular , the entropy of the projected hfb density @xmath134 , which is required for the calculation of the free energy at finite temperature , is difficult to calculate in the paired phase since the hfb hamiltonian does not commute with the particle - number operator .",

    "another improvement would be to use the pnp in the static - path approximation ( spa )  @xcite .",
    "the spa takes into account the static fluctuations of the mean field beyond its self - consistent solution . as with the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the particle - number projection can be carried out either before or after the spa integration .",
    "it would be useful to conduct a systematic assessment of such a particle - number projected spa .    finally , the pnp expressions derived here for the hfb approximation assume that the condensate is time - reversal invariant and are thus not completely general . for example , the condensates of odd - even and odd - odd nuclei break time - reversal symmetry .",

    "@xcite , but the application of this formula is limited by a sign ambiguity . for the case of statistical density operators",
