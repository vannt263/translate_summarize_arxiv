    "electron transport through quantum dot configurations has been a subject of permanent interest in the last years . since quantum dots electrons",

    "the formation of band structures in finite one - dimensional arrays of quantum dots has been also discussed.@xcite    a distinctive feature of electron tunneling through quantum dots is the retention of the quantum phase coherence . for this reason , multiple connected geometries involving quantum dots exhibit quantum interference phenomena , such as the fano effect,@xcite which arises from the interference between a discrete state and the continuum.@xcite several works have been concerned with the study of transmission through a parallel - coupled double quantum dot molecule embedded in an aharonov - bohm interferometer.@xcite this is characterized by the formation of a tunable fano resonance in the conductance spectrum .",
    "this resonance is associated to a long - lived molecular state , the position and lifetime of which are controlled by the magnetic field .",
    "for some particular values of the magnetic flux , that molecular state decouples completely from the leads,@xcite becoming a  bound state in the continuum \" ( bic ) .",
    "such a resonant state with infinite lifetime was called `` ghost fano resonance '' in ref . .",
    "the existence of bound states embedded in the continuum was early proposed by von neumann and wigner for certain spatially oscillating attractive potentials for a one - particle schrdinger equation.@xcite much later , stillinger and herrick generalized von neumann s work and analyzed a two - electron problem , where bics were formed despite the interaction between electrons.@xcite the occurrence of bics was discussed in a system of coupled coulombic channels and , in particular , in an hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the authors interpreted the formation of these states as result of interference between resonances of different channels .",

    "the robustness of the molecular states for the triple quantum dot molecule can be understood physically as follows : in the triple molecule the phases acquired by the electron in covering some of the paths , namely , those containing the central quantum dot , are smaller than those gained when the electron travel though paths containing the outer dots .",

    "report the formation of localized states .",
    "we interpret these results as bics in the same sense described in the present paper .",
    "however , we think that the above results are not conclusive and further research is necessary to know the effect of the electron - electron interaction on the formation of bics .",
