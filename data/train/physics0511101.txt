    "stock volatility is of interest to traders because it quantifies risk , optimizes the portfolio @xcite and provides a key input of option pricing models that are based on the estimation of the volatility of the asset @xcite .",
    "although the logarithmic changes of stock price from time @xmath12 to time @xmath13 , @xmath14 is uncorrelated , their absolute values are known to be long - term power - law correlated .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath15 possesses a power - law distribution @xcite , @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xcite . also , @xmath18 , the number of times that the volatility @xmath19 exceeds a threshold @xmath1 , follows a power - law in the time @xmath13 after a market crash , @xmath20 with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) is the financial analog of the omori earthquake law @xcite .",
    "recently yamasaki et al .",
    "@xcite studied the behavior of return intervals @xmath0 between volatilities that are above a certain threshold @xmath1 [ illustrated in fig .",
    "they analyzed _ daily _ financial records and found scaling and memory in return intervals , similar to that found in climate data @xcite . to investigate the generality of these statistical features of ref .",
    "@xcite , here we examine 31 _ intraday _ datasets .",
    "we find that similar scaling and memory behavior occurs at a wide range of time resolutions ( not only on the daily scale ) . due to the larger size of the datasets we analyze , we are able to extend our work to significantly larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , scaling functions are well approximated by the stretched exponential form , which indicates long range correlations in volatility records @xcite .",
    "also , we explore clusters of short and long return intervals , and find that the larger is the cluster the stronger is the memory .",
    "we analyze the trades and quotes ( taq ) database from new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , which records every trade for all the securities in united states stock market for the two - year period from january 1 , 2001 to december 31 , 2002 , a total of 497 trading days .",
    "we study all 30 companies of the dow jones industrial average index ( djia ) .",
    "the sampling time is 1 minute and the average size is about 160,000 values per djia stock .",
    "another database we analyze is the standard and poor s 500 index ( s&p 500 ) , which consists of 500 companies .",
    "this database is for a 13-year period , from january 1 , 1984 to december 31 , 1996 , with one data point every 10 minutes ( total data points is about 130,000 ) . for both databases ,",
    "the records are continuous in regular open hours for all trading days , due to the removal of all market closure times .",
    "in contrast to daily volatilities , the intraday data are known to show specific patterns @xcite , due to different behaviors of traders at different periods during the trading day .",
    "for example , the market is very active immediately after the opening @xcite , due to information arriving while the market is closed . to understand the possible effect on volatility correlations , we investigate the daily trend in djia stocks .",
    "the intraday pattern , denoted as @xmath22 @xcite , is defined as @xmath23 which is the return at a specific moment @xmath24 of the day averaged over all @xmath25 trading days , and @xmath26 is the price change at time @xmath24 in day @xmath27 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the intraday pattern @xmath22 has similar behavior for the four stocks at&t , citi , ge , ibm and the average over 30 djia stocks .",
    "the pattern is not uniformly distributed , exhibiting a pronounced peak at the opening hours and a minimum around time @xmath28 min , that may cause some artificial correlations . to avoid the effect of this daily oscillation",
    ", we remove the intraday pattern by studying @xmath29 in order to compare different stocks , we define the normalized volatility @xmath30 by dividing @xmath31 with its standard deviation , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the time average for each separate stock . consequently , the threshold @xmath1 is measured in units of the standard deviation of @xmath31 . as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , every volatility @xmath30 above a threshold @xmath1 ( `` event '' ) is picked and the series of the time intervals between those events , @xmath34 , is generated .",
    "the series depends on the threshold @xmath1 . to maintain good statistics and avoid spurious discreteness effects @xcite",
    ", we restrict ourselves to thresholds with average intervals @xmath35 time units ( 30 minutes for the s&p 500 and three minutes for the 30 stocks of the djia ) .",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the pdf of the return interval series @xmath34 .",
    "figure  2 shows results for the s&p  500 index and for two typical djia stocks , citi and ge .",
    "the time window @xmath36 of volatility records is 1 minute for the djia stocks and 10 minutes for the s&p 500 .",
    "the left panels of fig .  2 [ ( a ) , ( c ) , ( e ) ] , show that the pdf @xmath2 for large @xmath1 decays slower than for small @xmath1 .",
    "the right panels of fig .  2 [ ( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) ] show the _ scaled _ pdf @xmath37 as a function of the _ scaled _ return intervals @xmath38 .",
    "the five curves for @xmath39 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 collapse onto a single curve .",
    "thus the distribution functions follow the scaling relation @xcite @xmath40 we also study the other 28 djia stocks and find that they have similar scaling behavior for different thresholds .    to examine the scaling for larger thresholds with good statistics , we calculate the return intervals of each djia stock , and then aggregate all the data . as shown in fig .",
    "2(g ) and ( h ) , the scaling behavior extends even to @xmath41 . in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the scaling function @xmath42 does not directly depend on the threshold @xmath1 but only through @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath2 for an individual value of @xmath1 is known , distributions for other thresholds can be predicted by the scaling eq .",
    "( 7 ) . in particular",
    ", the distribution of rare events ( very large @xmath1 , such as market crashes ) may be extrapolated from smaller thresholds , which have enough data to achieve good statistics .",
    "next , we investigate the similarity of scaling functions for different companies . scaled pdfs @xmath37 with @xmath39 for return intervals ( upper symbols ) are plotted in fig .",
    "3(a ) , showing the s&p 500 index and 30 djia stocks in alphabetical order of names ( one symbol represents one dataset ) .",
    "we see that the pdf curves collapse , so their scaling functions @xmath5 are similar , consistent with a universal structure for @xmath2 . as suggested by the line on upper symbols in fig .",
    "3(a ) and on the filled symbols in fig .",
    "4 , the function @xmath5 may follow a stretched exponential form @xcite , @xmath44 remarkably , we find that all 31 datasets have similar exponent values , and conclude that @xmath45 appears to be `` universal '' , with @xmath46 the value @xmath47 is found to be almost the same for all datasets , @xmath48 further , we plot the stretched exponential fit for four companies , at&t , citi , ge and ibm in a log - linear plot [ fig .  3(b ) ] .",
    "we find good fits for all four companies , and we also find good collapse for different thresholds for each stock .",
    "the scaling function clearly differs from the poisson distribution for uncorrelated data , @xmath49 , which is demonstrated by curves on lower symbols in fig .",
    "3(a ) .    for statistical systems ,",
    "the time resolution of records is an important aspect .",
    "the system may exhibit diverse behavior in different time windows @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "4 we analyze five time scales for four typical companies ( @xmath39 ) : ( a ) at&t , ( b ) citi , ( c ) ge and ( d ) ibm .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath50 , 5 , 10 , 15 , and 30 minutes , the @xmath37 curves collapse onto one curve , which shows the persistence of the scaling for a broad range of time scales .",
    "thus there seems to be universal structure for stocks not only in different companies , but also in each stock with various time resolutions .    to understand the origin of the scaling behavior in return intervals , we analyze pdfs of the volatility after shuffling ( in order to remove correlations in the volatility records @xcite ) . for uncorrelated data , as expected , a poisson distribution is obtained , shown by the lower symbols in fig .",
    "3(a ) and empty symbols in fig .  4 .",
    "in contrast to the distribution for uncorrelated records , the distribution of the actual return intervals ( the upper symbols in fig .",
    "3(a ) and filled symbols in fig .",
    "4 ) is more frequent for both small and large intervals , and less frequent in intermediate intervals .",
    "the distinct difference between the distributions of return intervals in the original data and shuffled records suggests that the scaling behavior and the form in eq .",
    "( 8) must arise from long - term correlations in the volatility ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the sequence of return intervals may , or may not , be fully characterized by @xmath2 , depending on the time organization of the sequence .",
    "if the sequence of return intervals are _ uncorrelated _ , they are independent of each other and totally determined by the probability distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the intervals are _ correlated _ , the memory will also affect the order in the sequence of intervals .    to investigate the memory in the records , we study the conditional pdf , @xmath9 , which is the probability of finding a return interval @xmath0 immediately after a return interval of size @xmath10 . in records without memory ,",
    "@xmath9 should be identical to @xmath2 and independent of @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise , it should depend on @xmath10 .",
    "due to the poor statistics for a single @xmath10 , we study @xmath9 for a bin ( range ) of @xmath10 . the entire database is partitioned into 8 equal - size bins with intervals in increasing length .",
    "5 shows @xmath9 for @xmath10 in the smallest ( solid symbols ) and largest ( open symbols ) subset of the four stocks at&t , citi , ge and ibm . for @xmath10 in the lowest bin",
    "the probability is larger for small @xmath0 , while for @xmath10 in the largest bin the probability is higher for large @xmath0 .",
    "thus , large @xmath10 tend to be followed by large @xmath0 , while small @xmath10 tend to be followed by small @xmath0 ( `` clustering '' ) , which indicates memory in the return interval sequence . thus , long - term correlations in the volatility records affect the pdf of intervals as well as the time organization of @xmath0 .",
    "note also that @xmath9 for all thresholds seems to collapse onto a single scaling function for each of the @xmath10 subsets .",
    "further , the memory is also seen in the mean conditional return interval @xmath11 , which is the first moment of @xmath9 , immediately after a given @xmath10 subset .",
    "filled symbols in fig .",
    "6 show again that large @xmath0 tend to follow large @xmath10 , and small @xmath0 follow small @xmath10 , similar to the clustering in the conditional pdf @xmath9 .",
    "correspondingly , shuffled data ( empty symbols ) exhibits a flat shape , demonstrating that the value of @xmath0 is independent on the previous interval @xmath10 .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath11 show memory for intervals that immediately follow an interval @xmath10 , which indicates short - term memory in the return interval records .",
    "to study the possibility that the long - term memory exists in the return intervals sequence , we investigate the mean return interval after a cluster of @xmath51 intervals , all within a bin @xmath10 . to obtain good statistics we divide the sequence only into two bins , separated by the median of the entire database .",
    "we denote intervals that are above the median by `` + '' , and that are below the median by ``  '' .",
    "accordingly , @xmath51 consecutive `` + '' or ``  '' intervals form a cluster and the mean of the return intervals after such @xmath51-clusters may reveal the range of memory in the sequence .",
    "fig .  7 shows the mean return intervals @xmath52 vs. the size @xmath51 , where @xmath10 in @xmath52 refers to a cluster with size @xmath51 . for `` + '' clusters ,",
    "the mean intervals increase with the size of the cluster , the opposite of that for ``  '' clusters .",
    "the results indicate long - term memory in the sequence of @xmath0 since we do not see a plateau for large clusters .    to further test the range of long - term correlations in the return interval time series",
    ", we apply the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) method @xcite . after removing trends",
    ", the dfa method computes the root - mean - square fluctuation @xmath53 of a time series within windows of @xmath54 points , and determines the correlation exponent @xmath55 from the scaling function @xmath56 .",
    "the exponent @xmath55 is related to the autocorrelation function exponent @xmath45 by @xmath57 and autocorrelation function @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xcite . when @xmath60 , the time series has long - term correlations and exhibits persistent behavior , meaning that large values are more likely to be followed by large values and small values by small ones .",
    "the value @xmath61 indicates that the signal is uncorrelated ( white noise ) .",
    "we analyze the volatility series and the return interval series by using dfa method .",
    "the results of s&p 500 index and 30 djia stocks for two regimes ( split by @xmath62 for volatilities and @xmath63 for return intervals , which corresponds to 1 day in time scale ) are shown in fig",
    ".  8 @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath55 values are distinctly different in the two regimes , and both of them are larger than @xmath64 , which indicates long - term correlations in the investigated time series but they are not the same for different time scales . for large scales ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 for the volatility ( group mean@xmath67 standard deviation ) and @xmath68 for the return interval are almost the same , and the differences are within the error bars .",
    "these results are consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath55 of the volatilities , and with ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath55 of the return intervals . for short scales ( @xmath69 ) , we find @xmath70 for the volatility ( consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath71 of the return intervals , and the differences are again in the range of the error bars . here",
    "error bars refer to that of each dataset , not the standard deviation of @xmath55 group for @xmath72 datasets , and average error bars @xmath73 .",
    "similar crossover from short scales to large scales with similar values of @xmath55 have been also observed for intertrade times by ivanov et al . @xcite .",
    "such behavior suggests a common origin for the strong persistence of correlations in both volatility and return interval records , and in fact the clustering in return intervals is related to the known effect of volatility clustering @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath74 could be a result of @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( 11 ) , where @xmath76 is the average of the two @xmath55 regimes that we observe ( see fig .",
    "it is possible for the value of @xmath45 to be different for small and large @xmath1 values .",
    "the reason for this differences is that for small @xmath1 the low volatilities are probed and therefore the time scales are controlled by @xmath77 ( below the crossover ) , while for the large @xmath1 the high volatilities are probed , which represent large time scales ( above the crossover ) , controlled by @xmath78 .",
    "we will undertake further analysis to test this possibility .    in summary , we studied scaling and memory effects in volatility return intervals for _ intraday _ data .",
    "we found that the distribution function for the return intervals can be well described by a single scaling function that depends only on the ratio of @xmath38 for djia stocks and s&p 500 index , for various time scales ranging from short term @xmath50 minute to @xmath79 minutes .",
    "the scaling function , which results from the long - term correlations in the volatility records , differs from the poisson distribution for uncorrelated data .",
    "we found that the scaling function can be well approximated by the stretched exponential form , @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we showed strong memory effects by analyzing the conditional pdf @xmath9 and mean return interval @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , we studied the mean interval after a cluster of intervals , and found long - term memory for both clusters of short and long return intervals .",
    "we demonstrated by the dfa method that the volatility and return intervals have long - term correlations with similar correlation exponents .",
