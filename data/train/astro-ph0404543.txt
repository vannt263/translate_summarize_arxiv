    "the study of the @xmath0 universe has become a major theme in astronomy over the past decade . in particular ,  observations of quasars at @xmath3 reveal the physical conditions in the vicinities of the first massive black holes to form in the universe . prior to 2000",
    ", there were only six published detections of quasars at @xmath4 ( see kaspi , brandt , & schneider 2000 ; hereafter kbs00 ) . in the last four years , through the unprecedented sensitivities of  and  as well as optical wide - area surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , the number has risen to nearly one hundred .    equally important are wide - area radio surveys , such as faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first ; e.g. , becker et al .",
    "1995 ) and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al.1998 ) , to constrain the properties of radio cores , jets , and lobes .",
    "radio - selected samples of radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) , although sampling a minority of the total quasar population , are less prone to selection effects than optical surveys , as radio emission is not affected by absorption due to dust .",

    "( ) in which the  radiation is probably dominated by a jet - linked component .",
    "these blazars represent a minority of the rlq population , however , and so are not suitable for representative statistical studies .",
    "recently , _",
    "chandra s _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) has obtained  detections of many rqqs ( predominantly with ) , which represent the majority population of quasars in the local universe and so too , apparently , at high redshift ( e.g. , schmidt et al .",
    "1995 ; stern et al .",
    "2000 ) . through these studies ( e.g. , brandt et al . 2002 ; vignali et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a , b ) , the basic  properties of rqqs have become reasonably well understood . perhaps surprisingly , given the strong evolution of the quasar population ( e.g. , boyle et al .",
    "2000 ; fan et al.2001b ) , high - redshift rqqs have remarkably similar  and broad - band properties to rqqs at low - to - moderate redshift ( after controlling for luminosity effects ; e.g. , vignali , brandt , & schneider 2003 , hereafter vbs03 ) , suggesting that the accretion mechanism does not dramatically evolve with time .",
    "prior to the current paper , however , there were only four published  detections of @xmath0 rlqs with corresponding to typical rlqs in the local universe ( excluding the blazar pmn  0525@xmath73343 which has @xmath9 ) .    here",
    "we report  detections of six radio - selected rlqs and one rqq ( first 0747 + 2739 ) which is radio detected and optically bright .",
    "these objects have been selected as prime targets for observations based on their bright optical and radio fluxes , and they have been chosen to represent the majority population of rlqs .",

    "( 2001 ) , and one is from the sdss , first presented in anderson et al .",
    "five of the rlqs have published detections at both 1.4  ghz and 5  ghz and have flat radio spectra with @xmath10  to @xmath80.3 ( @xmath11 ) . in the case of first  1309@xmath85733 ,",
    "the upper limit on the 5  ghz flux density gives @xmath12 , so it is possible that this object is also a flat - spectrum rlq .",
    "none of the quasars shows any significant structure in the first radio images ( these are the best radio images available , with an angular resolution of @xmath13 ) .",
    "while the rqq first  0747@xmath82739 is relatively radio - weak compared to our other objects , it is one of the optically brightest quasars at @xmath0 , and an overabundance of c  iv absorption in the optical spectrum suggests that it may be a transition broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar ( richards et al .",
    "given that rlqs are often substantially brighter than rqqs with comparable optical luminosity ( e.g. , zamorani et al .  1981 ; worrall et al .",
    "1987 ) , these objects are prime targets for  snapshot ( e.g. , ) observations .",
    "indeed , all seven of our sources are detected with a minimum of @xmath14  20 counts .",
    "this brings the total sample of @xmath0  detected rlqs to 15 , more than doubling the number of moderately radio - loud quasars and filling the gap ( as shown in figure  1 ) between the many  observations of @xmath0 rqqs and the extreme blazars .",
    "quasars with x - ray detections can be found at http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/niel/papers/highz-xray-detected.dat ] to date there are @xmath15 known @xmath0 rlqs ; thus the objects in our sample comprise @xmath16% of those known .",

    "recent work ( e.g. , cirasuolo et al .  2003 ; ivezi et al.2002 , 2004 ) has sparked new controversy over the existence of bimodality in the radio - loudness distribution of quasars , suggested first by strittmatter et al .",

    "the sample does not appear to be biased by the presence of a few objects with atypically high signal - to - noise ratios ( see table  2 ) , and the removal of any one of these objects does not produce significantly different results .    we have corrected each spectrum for the quantum - efficiency degradation of acis at low energies using the correction supplied via the  calibration database ( caldb ) , version 2.26 . while the degradation is not severe above @xmath104  kev , it could significantly affect estimates of  absorption if not properly corrected .",
    "we have also repeated our analysis using the acisabs correction , based on data from the external calibration source aboard ( the caldb correction is derived from gratings data ) . due to differences in the extrapolation of the time - dependent quantum efficiency between the models ( see marshall et al .",
    "2004 ) , the acisabs correction leads to fits with a slightly lower absorption column and photon index , but the results are generally consistent .",
    "the joint spectral fitting of the nine unbinned quasar spectra was carried out using the cash statistic ( cash 1979 ) , which is well suited to low - count sources ( e.g. , nousek & shue 1989 ) . since the cash statistic is applied to the unbinned data , it allows us to retain all available spectral information .",
    "we can also assign to each source its own galactic absorption and redshift . the resulting joint spectrum ( in the rest - frame band ) , while derived from only @xmath105  counts , is reasonably good due to the extremely low background of  ( there are only @xmath13  background counts in all source cells ) .",

    "to search for evidence of intrinsic  absorption in the above sample of nine moderate-@xmath1 rlqs , we added to the joint spectral model a redshifted neutral absorption component ( the xspec model _ zphabs _ ) with the redshift set to that of each source . with this model",

    "turner ( 2000 ) confirmed earlier suggestions by cappi et al .",

    "( 1998 ) of a significant correlation for rlqs , finding that rlqs have typical column densities of ( see their figure 9 ) .",
    "also , for two of the @xmath0 blazars , strong intrinsic  absorption ( ) has been suggested by spectral flattening at low energies : pmn  0525@xmath73344 ( worsley et al .",
    "2004a ) and gb  1428@xmath84217",
    "( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "2001 ; worsley et al .",
    "our findings are generally consistent with these claims and extend this result to the majority of rlqs with moderate radio - loudness ( the average radio - loudness of the objects in the above samples is , while that for the present sample is ) .",
    "the enhanced radio and  emission of rlqs in comparison to rqqs is usually attributed to a relativistic jet - linked component .",
    "for core - dominated , flat - spectrum rlqs , the majority of the emission is presumably from the small - scale jet close to the agn , which , aided by doppler boosting , accounts for the increased  luminosities and flatter  spectra of rlqs as a whole ( e.g. , worrall et al .",
    "1987 ; wilkes & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "for more extended ( kpc scale )  jets , there has been considerable debate over the process responsible for the  emission .",
    "in several cases , low optical luminosities , which preclude pure synchrotron emission from a single electron population , have led to synchrotron models with more complicated electron energy distributions ( e.g. , stawarz et al .  2004 ) or models based on some form of ic scattering . in the case of ic emission , individual observations of  jets lead to differing conclusions as to the primary source of ic seed photons ( see harris & krawczynski 2002 for a review ) .",
    "the obvious choices are the synchrotron photons themselves ( synchrotron self - compton ",
    "ssc ) , uv photons from the accretion disk , or cosmic microwave background photons ( ic / cmb ) ; the relative importance of these sources may depend on factors such as the quasar s environment , orientation , and the bulk relativistic motion of the jet . both ssc and ic from uv photons produced in the agn presumably dominate close to the core of the quasar , while ic / cmb may dominate at large distances . at high redshift",
    "ic / cmb is particularly relevant since , as pointed out originally by rees & setti ( 1968 ) and recently by schwartz ( 2002 ) , the cosmological decrease in surface brightness as @xmath107 is compensated for by a @xmath108 increase in the energy density of the cmb . above ,  jets dominated by the ic / cmb process",
    "could even outshine their parent quasars ( see figure  2 of schwartz 2002 ) .",
    "as established in @xmath813.1 , our @xmath0 rlqs are @xmath103 times  brighter than rqqs with comparable optical luminosity , so the x - rays we have detected appear to be largely from a jet - linked component .",
    "we do not , however , observe any evidence for spatially extended emission in the  images ( see @xmath812.3 ) , nor do the first radio images show any obvious spatial structure ( note that the sub - arcsecond angular resolution of  is better than the @xmath13  resolution of the first survey ) . in figure  [ brink ]",
    "we have plotted the broad - band spectral index @xmath109 versus radio loudness for our observations of @xmath0 rlqs ( triangles ) along with the brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample of radio - selected flat - spectrum rlqs which spans the @xmath19 ( solid circles ) and @xmath1104 ( open circles ) redshift ranges .",
    "although the number of moderately radio - loud rlqs in the brinkmann et al.(1997 ) sample is limited , it is clear that the @xmath0 rlqs are comparable in their  and broad - band properties to those at low - to - moderate redshift .",
    "the @xmath0 blazars ( star symbols ) also lie within the observed range of these parameters for comparable low - redshift objects .",
    "we have performed a similar comparison of our @xmath0 rlqs to the low - to - moderate redshift sample of flat - spectrum rlqs presented in fig .  4 of fabian et al .  ( 1999 ) and",
    "reach the same conclusion .",
    "figure  6 has implications for jet  emission mechanisms in rlqs .",
    "in particular , the observations provide evidence that the ic / cmb process does not dominate the total  production of these objects ; if it did , then the the arguments of schwartz ( 2002 ) predict that these jets at @xmath0 should be as bright or brighter in x - rays than the quasar cores .",
    "such an enhancement would lead to a systematic flattening of  by relative to comparable objects at low redshift , which we do not observe .",
    "rather , it seems that the x - rays are probably made primarily on small scales where the quasar photon field dominates the cmb photon field .",
    "this is consistent with expectations for low - redshift flat - spectrum rlqs , where on small scales ssc and external ic scattering from agn seed photons are thought to dominate .",
    "still , the question remains : if we believe that much of the emission from these objects is associated with a jet - linked component on small scales , then why do we not see the extended ic / cmb jet , which should be significantly enhanced by the increased energy density of the cmb at high redshift ?",
    "schwartz ( 2002 ) uses the jets from the quasars 3c  273 ( @xmath111 ) and pks  0637@xmath7752 ( @xmath112 ) as examples of ic / cmb jets ( at projected distances of roughly 25  kpc and 75  kpc , respectively ) that should outshine their parent quasars above @xmath113 .",
    "both of these quasars have flat ( core ) radio spectra similar to those of our objects , and the predicted  count rates of the cores as they would appear at @xmath113 ( see figure  2 of schwartz 2002 ) of a few@xmath114  cts  s@xmath25 are consistent with our observations .",
    "3c  273 and pks  0637@xmath7752 are more radio loud than our quasars by nearly an order of magnitude , with @xmath115 and 2200 , and so it may be that differences in either orientation or intrinsic jet power may account for our observations . but even in the case of the recently discovered  jet from the @xmath116 blazar gb  1508@xmath85714 , where the ic / cmb process has been invoked ( siemiginowska et al .",
    "2003 ; yuan et al .",
    "2003 ; cheung 2004 ) , we do not see such a dramatic enhancement .",
    "this jet only accounts for @xmath117% of the quasar luminosity and was discovered in a  observation with a lengthy ( 89  ks ) exposure time . to test our sensitivity to detecting such jets , we randomly selected 800  s segments of the gb  1508@xmath85714 data , chosen to have @xmath118   counts in the full band , matching the average number of counts in our  snapshot observations .",
    "we analyzed these images following the procedure of @xmath812.3 and did not find clear evidence for extent in any case . inspecting the raw and adaptively smoothed images by eye , only in of the fields could we observe hints of the jet .",
    "this is not surprising , as at @xmath89% of the quasar luminosity we expect only 12 counts from the jet in each field .",
    "so if our moderate-@xmath1 rlqs have jets similar in nature to that of gb  1508@xmath85714 ( perhaps at a larger viewing angle to account for the difference in radio - loudness ) then we would not expect to detect extended jets from these snapshot images .",
    "overall , from this preliminary sample , it appears that the small - scale jet components of flat - spectrum rlqs do not change significantly between redshifts 0 and 5 .",
    "this result is broadly in accordance with recent studies ( e.g. , vbs03 ) which imply that the disk / corona components of rqqs do not significantly evolve with redshift in the range .",
    "apparently , rlq jets are also almost completely built - up systems at .",
    "although the @xmath119 quasar first  0747@xmath82739 is radio - quiet ( a faint detection in the first survey gives a radio - loudness of @xmath120 ) , it is one of the most optically luminous quasars at @xmath0 with ( compare with figure  1 of vignali et al .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found an overabundance of c iv absorption systems in the spectrum of first  0747@xmath82739 , with at least 14 independent absorption systems spanning a redshift range of longward of the ly@xmath121 forest .",
    "they concluded that the absorption is most likely intrinsic to the quasar , resulting from multiple high - velocity absorption systems at the spatial , density , or temporal edge of a bal region .",
    "first  0747@xmath82739 may be a quasar in the transition region between bal and normal quasars .    from the  observation of first  0747@xmath82739 , we measure an observed - frame flux of , from which we derive a rest - frame luminosity of and an optical - to-  spectral index of . based on a significant correlation between c iv absorption and -weakness , brandt , laor , & wills ( 2000 )",
    "have suggested that  absorption associated with a bal - type outflow is the primary cause of -weakness in @xmath122 blue agn , and recent results suggest that this is likely the case for @xmath0 quasars as well ( see vignali et al .",
    "2003b and references therein ) .",
    "despite its significant c iv absorption , first  0747@xmath82739 does not appear to be notably x - ray weak when compared to other highly luminous quasars ( see , e.g. , figure  3 of brandt , schneider , & vignali 2004 ) .",
    "however , since we are sampling highly penetrating x - rays with rest - frame energies of ( and have a limited number of photons ) , the x - ray column density constraints are not tight .",
    "spectral fitting as described in  3.2 indicates that intrinsic neutral absorption with is consistent with our data .",
    "of course , even larger column densities can be accommodated for ionized x - ray absorption ( as is likely expected from the observation of c iv absorption ) .",
    "thus , our results are at least consistent with expectations from brandt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , even if they can not directly support these expectations .",
    "we have presented new  detections of six rlqs and one rqq at , thereby significantly enlarging the number of @xmath0 rlqs with x - ray detections .",
    "our rlq targets have moderate @xmath1 parameters of ; they are more representative of the overall rlq population than many of the ( @xmath123 ) rlqs at @xmath0 previously studied in x - rays .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .",
    "moderate-@xmath1 rlqs at @xmath0 have enhanced x - ray emission relative to rqqs of the same redshift and optical luminosity .",
    "the degree of enhancement , a factor of @xmath103 in x - ray luminosity , is consistent with that observed at low redshift for comparable objects and is presumably associated with a jet - linked emission component . as in the local universe ,",
    "the x - ray - to - optical flux ratios of rlqs at @xmath0 are intermediate between those of rqqs and those of rlqs .",
    "2 .   joint x - ray spectral analyses of moderate-@xmath1 rlqs show that , on average , their spectra can be fitted with a power - law model and galactic absorption ; the average best - fit power - law photon index of is consistent with that for comparable objects at low redshift .",
    "adding an absorption component to the fit , we find tentative evidence ( 90% significance ) for excess intrinsic x - ray absorption on average , and our best - fit estimate of the cold absorption column of is consistent with previous claims of increased absorption toward high - redshift rlqs .",
    "the somewhat higher best - fit photon index of in this model is still consistent with previous estimates for rlqs at low redshift .",
    "3 .   we do not detect extended x - ray emission associated with jets from any of our rlqs , which , if dominated by the ic / cmb process as suggested , should be significantly enhanced at @xmath0 .",
    "if the jets in these objects are similar to the more modest  jet recently discovered from the @xmath116 blazar gb  1508@xmath85714 ( which accounts for only @xmath89% of the quasar  luminosity ) , we expect that the jets are below the sensitivity limit of our snapshot observations .",
    "overall , our data are consistent with the idea that the dominant x - ray production mechanisms of @xmath0 and @xmath124 rlqs are similar .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that an abundance of c iv absorption systems in the optical spectrum of first  0747@xmath82739 are intrinsic to the quasar and that it represents a class of objects in a transition phase between normal and bal quasars . from our observations ,",
