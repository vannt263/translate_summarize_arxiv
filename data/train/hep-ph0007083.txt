    "<S> petersburg , 188350 , russia    nearly 40 years ago it was predicted that hadronic total cross sections would approach a constant asymptotic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the regge trajectory whose exchange ensures this behaviour became known as the pomeron , with intercept @xmath7 . even today </S>",
    "<S> the observed slowly rising ( high energy ) total cross sections , and elastic scattering behaviour in the near forward direction , are remarkably well described by an effective trajectory @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the square of the 4-momentum transfer ( in units of gev@xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays this is known as the soft  or non - perturbative  pomeron .    </S>",
    "<S> more recently , interest in pomeron physics has been revived by studies of diffractive events  in proton - proton collisions , which contain a rapidity gap in the final state , such that the hadrons produced in the collision only populate part of the detector away from the direction of one of the outgoing protons . </S>",
    "<S> a supplementary condition for the presence of soft pomeron exchange is that there should be a slow variation of the cross section as a function of the width of the rapidity gap . </S>",
    "<S> the recent interest dates from the ingelman and schlein conjecture @xcite that there would also be hard  diffractive events in which the final state contains jets as well as a rapidity gap , and that the pomeron ( associated with the gap ) is treated as a real particle made up of quarks and gluons which take part in the hard subprocess . </S>",
    "<S> such hard  diffractive events have indeed been observed in high energy @xmath0 collisions , originally in the ua8 experiment @xcite at cern , and most recently by the cdf collaboration @xcite at the tevatron @xmath0 collider . the cdf collaboration study dijet production ( for jets with @xmath11  gev ) in diffractive events with a leading antiproton with a beam momentum fraction @xmath12 in the interval @xmath13 , at @xmath14  gev . for a given @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity gap is @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> similar hard diffractive events are seen in high energy deep inelastic electron - proton collisions in which the outgoing proton travels approximately in the original beam direction leaving a large gap between its rapidity and that of the other hadrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we speak of diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ddis cross section can be factorized @xcite into a convolution of universal  parton densities of the pomeron ( sometimes called diffractive parton distributions ) with the partonic - level cross sections of the hard subprocess , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in direct analogy with the parton model of ordinary dis in which we measure the universal parton densities of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> thus the hera ddis data may be used to constrain the parton densities of the pomeron , see , for example , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however it is found @xcite that when , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , the parton densities of the pomeron are used , together with the parton densities of the proton , to estimate the cross section for the hard diffractive dijet production observed in @xmath0 collisions , the factorized prediction turns out to be an order of magnitude larger than the data @xcite . to be precise </S>",
    "<S> the average discrepancy  in normalisation is [ eq : a1 ] d 0.06 0.02 . a similar discrepancy , [ eq : a2 ] d_w 0.18 0.04 , </S>",
    "<S> was found earlier between the predictions and the observations of diffractive @xmath16 production in @xmath0 collisions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a key assumption of the above factorization estimates is that the survival of the rapidity gap ( associated with pomeron , @xmath17 , exchange ) is the same in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) and 1(b ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that a breakdown of factorization is an evident consequence of qcd and occurs naturally due to the small probability , [ eq : a3 ] = s^2 t^2 , for the rapidity gap to survive in hadron - hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> first , there is the probability , @xmath18 , that the gap in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) may be filled by secondaries produced ( via parton rescattering ) in the underlying soft interaction ; note that there is no such rescattering in dis of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , there is the probability , @xmath19 , that the gap will be populated by extra gluon emission associated with the presence of the hard subprocess in diffractive hadron - hadron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> a similar form ( [ eq : a3 ] ) of the survival probability was computed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the central production of a higgs boson ( and also of a dijet system ) with a rapidity gap on either side . </S>",
    "<S> of course the survival probability @xmath20 depends on the particular process , on the incoming energy , and on the final state configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability not to have extra soft rescattering has been estimated to be @xmath21 for various processes at different collider energies @xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for our most recent calculation of @xmath22 , using explicit models for soft rescattering ; see also @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there it was found that the value of @xmath22 depends mainly on the optical density ( or opacity ) of the @xmath0 interaction as a function of the impact parameter @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , the survival probability @xmath22 was calculated from [ eq : b3 ] s = ( - ( _ t)/2 ) where the average was taken over the @xmath23 dependence , and the opacity was assumed to have the gaussian form [ eq : c3 ] ( _ t ) = ( - _ t^2/2b ) , where the slope of pomeron exchange amplitude [ eq : d3 ] b = b_0 + _ ^ ( s / s_0 ) , and @xmath24 specifies the amount of anti(proton ) dissociation in the rescattering process . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the eikonal model were tuned to describe the behaviour of the total and elastic differential @xmath27 ( or @xmath0 ) cross sections throughout the isr to tevatron energy range @xmath28 . taking the mean value of @xmath23 to be the proton radius , </S>",
    "<S> it was found @xcite that @xmath29 at the tevatron energy ( and up to an order of magnitude smaller still at lhc energies ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath29 in ( [ eq : a3 ] ) explains the main part of the discrepancy  reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some indication in favour of a small survival probability @xmath30 has also been observed by the d0 collaboration @xcite in the process with two large @xmath31 jets separated by a rapidity gap . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is a plausible explanation why @xmath32 , as seen in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical density is smaller in the periphery of the proton . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> there are indications that the radius of the spatial distribution of quarks in the proton is larger than that for gluons photoproduction ( @xmath33 ) with the behaviour of the proton electromagnetic form factor ( @xmath34 ) , indicates that gluons have a smaller spatial extent than quarks . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion follows from a study of qcd sum rules @xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath16 boson is produced dominantly by quarks , whilst high @xmath31 dijets originate mainly from gluons , we expect the survival probabilities of diffractive production to satisfy [ eq : a4 ] s^2 ( w ) > s^2 ( dijet ) .    using ( [ eq : b3])([eq : d3 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we may estimate how @xmath22 depends on the size of the rapidity gap . </S>",
    "<S> for the triple pomeron process shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) [ eq : b4 ] _ </S>",
    "<S> t^2 = b_0 - 2 _ ^(s / m^2 ) , where @xmath35 is the invariant mass of the outgoing state produced by the @xmath36 system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for example , as @xmath37 and the size of the gap increases ( that is @xmath38 increases ) , slightly smaller values of @xmath23 are sampled and this , in turn , gives a little smaller @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however this is not a strong effect , since @xmath39 is dominated by @xmath40 ( which is independent of @xmath41 and determined mainly by @xmath42 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand the data show some @xmath43 dependence , where @xmath43 is the momentum fraction of the pomeron entering the hard subprocess , @xmath44 of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cdf collaboration plot the discrepancy @xmath45 as a function of @xmath43 ( see fig .  4 of @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> they observe that @xmath45 decreases with increasing @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath43 dependence can be attributed to the behaviour of the survival factor @xmath46 of the rapidity gap against bremsstrahlung associated with the presence of the hard subprocess in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result depends on the scale @xmath47 at which the gluon structure function of the pomeron is sampled . </S>",
    "<S> note that in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) the lowest emitted gluon along the chain has transverse momentum close to @xmath47 , whereas the hard jets have transverse energy @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the bremsstrahlung into the rapidity gap can originate from either the hard subprocess or associated with the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> first , consider bremsstrahlung from one of the hard @xmath31 jets . when @xmath48 , the hard jets are far from the rapidity gap and so there is no radiation into the gap and no suppression of the diffractive process . on the other hand , when @xmath49 one of the large @xmath31 jets becomes the lowest gluon in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , @xmath47 , and bremsstrahlung will populate the gap , which is now adjacent in phase space . in this limit , if @xmath31 is sufficiently large , the suppression is , in principle , calculable from perturbative qcd , but will be sensitive to the experimental jet - searching algorithm .    now consider the @xmath48 and @xmath50 limits for bremsstrahlung associated with the pomeron . for @xmath48 , </S>",
    "<S> the scale @xmath51 of the pomeron structure function is soft </S>",
    "<S> . there may be emission into the gap , but it is not calculable perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this limit , it is the same pomeron , with the structure function , and the same emission , as that measured in diffractive dis at hera , and so there is no _ extra _ suppression in the diffractive @xmath0 process . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is quite different for @xmath50 , for which the scale @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration of the two @xmath9-channel gluons forming the pomeron is now asymmetric and we have more emission into the gap than in ddis , it is possible to have pomeron configurations with a large @xmath47 quark , but for gluons in ddis we still have @xmath53 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact for sufficiently large @xmath31 ( @xmath54 50  gev ) , the suppression of the diffractive @xmath55 process , arising from emission from the asymmetric gluon configuration of the pomeron , can be estimated from perturbative qcd ( see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have a qualitative understanding of the @xmath43 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath56 we expect ( in comparison to ddis ) little extra suppression of the diffractive @xmath0 process from _ bremsstrahlung _ either from the hard subprocess or from the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> that is @xmath57 in this limit . for increasing @xmath43 , </S>",
    "<S> the suppression due to radiation increases ( and @xmath58 decreases ) and , in fact , becomes calculable as @xmath59 if @xmath31 is sufficiently large ( with the pomeron structure function providing an effective infrared cut - off via a factor @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is perturbatively calculable ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the discussion of the @xmath43 dependence has necessarily been qualitative , it is encouraging that the main trend is clearly seen in the data , see fig .  4 </S>",
    "<S> of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we may identify @xmath62 for @xmath63 with the survival factor @xmath22 , since for @xmath48 we expect @xmath64 . at present </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to make a reliable comparison of diffractive @xmath0 and ddis data much below @xmath65 , since there are no ddis measurements in this region .    </S>",
    "<S> although the survival factor @xmath22 is responsible for the main breakdown of factorization , we note that there is another non - factorizing contribution in diffractive @xmath0 collisions collisions . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion can be found , for example , in the review of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ] . besides the graph of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) in which the second @xmath9-channel gluon ( which screens the colour flow in rapidity gap interval ) couples to a parton in the pomeron fragmentation region ( near the gap edge ) , there is also the possibility that the screening gluon couples to a fast spectator in the proton fragmentation region , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> typically in such a configuration the colour flow is screened at larger distances and we deal with large size components of the pomeron , so this contribution leads to a larger diffractive ( dijet ) cross section . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the true value of the soft  survival probability @xmath22 should be less than the estimate @xmath66 quoted above . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion from the cdf data is therefore consistent with the estimate @xmath29 at the tevatron energy obtained from the soft rescattering model .    </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been shown @xcite that the @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite diffractive hard scattering data can be described in terms of the soft colour interaction @xcite and generalized area law @xcite models . </S>",
    "<S> the unified description is obtained by implementing these models in the monte carlo generators lepto @xcite for @xmath1 and pythia @xcite for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however this soft colour   approach leads to a somewhat flatter @xmath43 dependence than is observed for the cdf diffractive data , when the model is tuned to describe the deep inelastic @xmath1 data gap survival factor is automatically included in pythia , which accounts for the possibility of soft rescattering in the underlying event ( the factor @xmath22 ) and the bremsstrahlung in the hard  subprocess ( part of the @xmath46 factor ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the soft colour model does not account for bremsstrahlung from the two - gluon dipole pomeron state . </S>",
    "<S> that is why @xmath67 ( or @xmath43 ) dependence in @xcite is flatter than that observed by cdf @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is different . </S>",
    "<S> here we emphasize , qualitatively , that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 hard diffractive data have been presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a way which demonstrates rather directly the role played by the survival probability factors @xmath22 and @xmath46 of ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , and which allows physical insight into the interpretation of the diffractive data .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the data for hard scattering processes containing a rapidity gap in @xmath0 collisions at the tevatron and the data for diffractive dis collected in @xmath1 collisions at hera , are compatible with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd factorization approach appears to lead to an order of magnitude discrepancy between the data sets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the breakdown of factorization is naturally explained by the much smaller chance of the rapidity gap surviving in @xmath0 collisions as compared to @xmath1 interactions . indeed the size , and @xmath43 dependence , of the suppression of diffractive dijet production seen at the tevatron @xcite is just what is expected from the population of the rapidity gap by underlying soft interactions and from bremsstrahlung associated with the presence of the hard subprocess . </S>"
