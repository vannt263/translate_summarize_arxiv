    "the magnetic structure of the rutheno - cuprates rusr@xmath0rcu@xmath0o@xmath9 ( ru1212r ) and rusr@xmath0(r , ce)@xmath0cu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( ru1222r ) , where r = gd , eu , and y , remains a topic of debate even after extensive investigations of their macroscopic magnetization ( m ) , neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) , and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) in the last few years.@xcite even in the relatively simple case of ru1212 , a large discrepancy exists .",
    "a npd investigation reported that the ru - spins ordered antiferromagnetically ( afm ) _ along _ the @xmath10-axis with a rather stringent upper limit of 0.1 and 0.2  @xmath11/ru at h = 0 and 7 t , respectively , for the ferromagnetic ( fm ) components of ru.@xcite the spontaneous magnetization of @xmath12  emu / mole at 5  k , however , leads to a significantly higher value of 0.28  @xmath11/ru after a geometric correction - factor of 2 for the random grain - orientation.@xcite the difference between the extrapolated zero - field magnetization of 0.7  @xmath13/ru and the npd estimation of @xmath7  0.2  @xmath11 at 7  t is even larger.@xcite the discrepancy is similarly striking when the nmr data are included .",
    "the zero - field nmr data suggest that the aligned moment , @xmath7  1.6  @xmath11/ru , should be _ perpendicular _ to the @xmath10-axis instead , and that the fm component should be a large part of the moment.@xcite while at least two other npd studies claim similarly negligible fm components,@xcite both the large fm moment and the perpendicular spin - direction were confirmed by independent nmr measurements.@xcite these conflicts will be difficult to reconcile , in our opinion , if these rutheno - cuprates are microscopically homogeneous .",
    "the magnetic behavior of ru1222 appears to be even more complicated.@xcite on one hand , the two compounds share the same basic features : well - defined fm - like features in low - field magnetizations around a transition temperature of @xmath4 ; spontaneous moments far larger than 0.1 @xmath11/ru;@xcite similar curie constants and fm - like curie - weiss ( c - w ) temperatures;@xcite and significant nonlinear isothermal @xmath5 with large extrapolated zero - field moments up to 23 @xmath4.@xcite in particular , when the zero - field nmr suggests similar large fm components,@xcite a preliminary npd investigation observed a negligible ferromagnetic moment in ru1222gd as well.@xcite the two compounds seem to share an unusual magnetic ground state , which appears afm - like in the npd data but fm - like in the @xmath5 and nmr signals . on the other hand ,",
    "quantitative differences exist between them : both the nonlinearity in @xmath5 and the spontaneous magnetization are significantly larger in ru1222.@xcite    it is interesting to note that some of the features seem to be characteristic of magnetic nanoparticles ( superparamagnets ) .",
    "as will be discussed below , the nonlinear @xmath5 far above @xmath4 and the discrepancy between the npd and nmr data are very reminiscent of some manganites , where phase - separations and the formation of ferromagnetic nanoclusters are well documented .",
    "a close re - examination of the magnetic properties of rutheno - cuprates , therefore , may help to resolve the magnetic structure of ru1222 .",
    "indeed , our static and dynamic magnetic data of a ru1222eu sample with @xmath14  k are consistent with a phase - separation model : ferromagnetic clusters ( or short - range spin - orders ) are first precipitated from the paramagnetic matrix below @xmath15 160180  k , followed by an afm transition of the matrix around @xmath16  k and an apparent fm transition around t@xmath17 , which we attribute to the establishment of long - range fm spin - orders .",
    "the model offers a possible explanation for the conflicting npd / nmr data as well as the josephson - junction - like superconductivity at lower temperatures,@xcite although detailed structure investigations are needed .",
    "ceramic rusr@xmath0(eu@xmath18ce@xmath19)@xmath0cu@xmath0o@xmath3 samples with @xmath20 were synthesized following the standard solid - state - reaction procedure .",
    "precursors were first prepared by calcining commercial oxides at 400900  @xmath21c under flowing o@xmath0 .",
    "mixed powder with a proper cation - ratio was then pressed into pellets and sintered at 900  @xmath21c in air for 24  h. the final heat treatment of the ceramics was done at 1090  @xmath21c for 60  h after repeatedly sintering at 1000  @xmath21c and regrinding at room temperature.@xcite the structure of the samples was determined by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a rigaku dmax - iiib diffractometer .",
    "the xrd pattern of the samples is similar to that previously reported.@xcite there are no noticeable impurity lines in the x - ray diffraction pattern within our experimental resolution of a few percent .",
    "the grain sizes ( @xmath7 220  @xmath22 m ) of the ceramic samples were measured using a jeol jsm 6400 scanning electron microscope ( sem ) .",
    "the magnetizations were measured using a quantum design squid magnetometer with an @xmath23 attachment .",
    "only the data of a rusr@xmath0(eu@xmath1ce@xmath2)@xmath0cu@xmath0o@xmath24 sample will be presented here since the features concerned are rather similar in more than five samples with various ce - doping of @xmath20 .",
    "the zero - field - cooled magnetization , @xmath27 , and the field - cooled magnetization , @xmath28 , of the ru1222eu sample at 10  oe are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . both @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "rise fm - like with cooling and the separation between @xmath28 and @xmath27 develops below 60 k , phenomena similar to those reported previously.@xcite such behavior is typical of magnets with domain - wall pinning . the inflection point of the @xmath28(10  oe ) is taken as the magnetic transition temperature @xmath14  k ( shown by the arrow in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) . to consider the effects of possible spin fluctuations , the observed @xmath29 at various @xmath26",
    "is plotted against @xmath30 since the spin fluctuations in a second - order transition are expected to be universal functions of @xmath31 after a proper @xmath26 scaling ( fig .  [ fig : fig2]).@xcite two features are readily noticed .",
    "first , two additional transitions , which are too small to be noticed in the linear @xmath32-scale of fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] , appear far above @xmath4 when @xmath33  t. similar features have been reported before , and attributed to either chemical inhomogeneity or a possible phase separation.@xcite their direct effect on the high - field magnetization , however , seems to be small , _",
    "i.e. _ both @xmath28 and @xmath34 appear to be smooth functions of @xmath35 with no transition - like features at the corresponding temperatures .",
    "we will therefore not discuss them further .",
    "second , strong nonlinearity , _",
    "i.e. _ an @xmath26-dependence of @xmath29 , appears up to @xmath15 160180  k with @xmath26 between 0.1 and 5  t , where the contributions of the two additional transitions should be negligible .",
    "similar nonlinearity has been noticed previously in both ru1212 and ru1222 up to @xmath36 12 and has been attributed to spin - fluctuation,@xcite magnetic anisotropy,@xcite and rotation of the canting angle.@xcite it should be noted that the magnetic hysteresis is rather small above @xmath4 . the separation between the @xmath26-increase and the @xmath26-decrease branches in a @xmath37  t @xmath32-@xmath26 loop is less than 1% with @xmath38  k and @xmath39  oe . the @xmath28 presented here , therefore , can be treated as the equilibrium magnetization and discussed in terms of the free energy involved .",
    "although @xmath26-dependent @xmath5 s are a common phenomena in magnets near their transition temperatures due to fluctuation , its appearance up to @xmath36 12 is highly unusual . in principle , the spin fluctuation near @xmath4 is determined by the competition between the magnetic interaction - energy @xmath40 and the thermal energy @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the aligned moment and the coherent volume , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26-dependence will be significant only if the magnetic energy is comparable to or larger than @xmath41 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 above @xmath4 , however , should decrease rapidly with the increase of @xmath31 and should approach the moment @xmath45 of individual spins outside a narrow critical region based on the scaling theory.@xcite far above @xmath4 , the fluctuation - caused nonlinearity should only exist at @xmath46 .",
    "the layered structure of ru1222 should not change the conclusion.@xcite although nonlinear @xmath5 s far above @xmath4 have been observed in some particular quasi-2d ferromagnets ( _ e.g. _ la@xmath47sr@xmath48mn@xmath0o@xmath49 ) , evidence generally points to mesoscopic phase - separations , rather than dimensionality , as the cause.@xcite    this situation is also unlikely to change with the order of the transition . the nucleation energy needed in a first - order transition should suppress the spin alignment at lower fields and make the @xmath50 more @xmath26-independent .",
    "this has been demonstrated in la@xmath51(ba@xmath19ca@xmath18)@xmath52mno@xmath53 , which exhibits a magnetic transition evolving from first - order to second - order with increasing @xmath54.@xcite indeed , the observed @xmath55 above @xmath4 has a weaker @xmath26-dependence at smaller @xmath54 , _",
    "i.e. _ those with a first - order transition . with @xmath56",
    "t in ru1222eu , therefore , it would be hard to interpret its nonlinear @xmath5 up to @xmath36 12 as simple spin fluctuations .      an extensive nonlinearity far above @xmath4 ( _ i.e. _ a violation of the scale theory ) , however , may occur if magnetic clusters ( or strong short - range correlations ) , which are a common phenomena in both manganites and cuprates , form .",
    "the above free - energy argument will require only a cluster size ( or the rigid spin - spin correlation - range ) of @xmath57 to create a significant nonlinearity .",
    "for example , the nonlinear @xmath5 in la@xmath47sr@xmath48mn@xmath0o@xmath49 ( a quasi-2d ferromagnet with a @xmath58  k ) up to @xmath59 ( 160  k ) was suggested by chauvet _",
    "_ to be related to the 79    clusters observed by npd and esr.@xcite in the case of ru1222 , the magnetic size of the possible clusters should be @xmath60  50  @xmath13 around 2  @xmath61  k to make a significant nonlinearity below 5  t. such clusters will contain at least 20  ru ions , based on the estimated moment @xmath62 3  @xmath13/ru , and should be regarded as superparamagnets . experimentally , this suggestion , _ i.e. _ part of ru1222 is in a spin - ordered state far above @xmath4 , is also in agreement with the mssbauer data of ru1222gd , where an ordered state with a hyperfine field @xmath63  t has been demonstrated up to @xmath64  k.@xcite    to make this argument more quantitative , the isothermal @xmath32-@xmath26 of the sample is analyzed using the langevin function ctnh(@xmath65 of superparamagnetic particles , where @xmath22 is the magnetic moment of the particles .",
    "this procedure essentially replaces the spin - correlation function of @xmath66 by a step function of @xmath67 : the spins are assumed to be tightly aligned within a coherence volume but without any directional correlation at larger distances , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the position and the spin - orientation , respectively , of the @xmath70th spin .",
    "the short - range correlations , therefore , are absorbed into the apparent cluster moment @xmath22 and the weaker long - range part is ignored .",
    "the function has been routinely used in analyzing the particle sizes of granular magnets by fitting the isothermal @xmath5 as a superposition of weighted langevin functions .",
    "it has been demonstrated in such cases that the deduced @xmath22 is a good approximation of the cluster size if the interparticle interactions are weak , but serves only as a _ lower - limit _ if the interactions are strong.@xcite it has been argued , in fact , that the main effect of interparticle interactions is to raise the effective temperature , @xmath71 , leading to an underestimation of @xmath22 by a factor of @xmath72.@xcite the situation is expected to be more complicated near @xmath4 of a second - order transition , where the interactions should be a continuing function of @xmath67 , and the spin alignment should be described by the scaling models instead .",
    "experimentally , however , the @xmath32(350  k ) of la@xmath51pb@xmath52mno@xmath53 , a manganite with a second - order transition at @xmath73  k , still fits remarkably well with the function without additional modifications , _ i.e. _ either a distribution of @xmath22 or an additional linear term on @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a).@xcite the deduced cluster size , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath74 at @xmath75 , seems to also be reasonable , at least as a lower limit , where @xmath76    is the distance between adjacent mn - spins .",
    "the langevin function , therefore , seems to be a good phenomenological tool when @xmath77 , keeping in mind that the @xmath22 deduced is only a lower limit . in the case of a first - order transition ,",
    "larger deviations are expected due to the suppression of @xmath32 at low fields . as an example",
    ", the @xmath32 of a la@xmath51ca@xmath52mno@xmath53 ceramic sample , which has a first - order transition at 265  k,@xcite was measured at 275  k ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the @xmath79-shape @xmath32-@xmath26 , which is the result of domain nucleation,@xcite makes the langevin function a less effective description ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b ) .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the @xmath80 200  @xmath13/cluster so - deduced is still comparable or smaller than the 15    spin - spin coherence length , _",
    "i.e. _ 100  mn / cluster , observed by small - angle - neutron - scatering.@xcite this demonstrates , therefore , that the langevin function should be proper for a qualitative estimation of the cluster size in ru1222eu , at least as its lower limit .",
    "the average @xmath32 between the @xmath26-increase branch and the @xmath26-decrease branch in isothermal @xmath32-@xmath26 loops of the ru1222eu sample was then calculated and taken as the equilibrium one .",
    "the @xmath32 of the ru1222eu sample at 80  k so - obtained ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]c ) , however , deviated significantly from the simple langevin function ( solid line in fig .  [ fig : fig3]c ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath32 is a linear function of @xmath26 above 2  t. this should not be a surprise since the paramagnetic background of eu is expected to be large in any case , and an additional linear term should be added to the langevin function .",
    "in fact , this is obvious even in the raw data of both ru1212 and ru1222 , where the @xmath32 above 34  t was previously reported being a linear function of @xmath26 with an almost @xmath35-independent slope.@xcite our data , therefore , were fitted as @xmath81 @xmath82 [ ctnh(@xmath65 ] ( thick dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]c ) , with an additional fitting parameter of @xmath84 .",
    "the fitting is rather good over a broad temperature range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note two unusual characteristics of the deduced parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "first , the @xmath22 is large and decreases with @xmath35 rather slowly over a broad range of @xmath85 150  k ( the fitting uncertainty makes the situation at higher temperatures less clear ) , which is very different from the @xmath22 of critical fluctuations ( as suggested by the ni data in the same figure).@xcite the deduced @xmath22 of ru1222ru , in fact , is several orders of magnitude larger than that of ni when @xmath86 ( open diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "such a large @xmath22 , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath7  300  @xmath13 at @xmath87 , is difficult to understand without a cluster formation ( or a short - range spin - spin correlation strong enough to prevail against the thermal disturbance @xmath41 ) , and justified the use of the langevin function .",
    "second , the deduced @xmath88 , which is roughly equal to the `` extrapolated zero - field moment '' in previous reports , varies with @xmath89 only gradually , without any sharp transition - like features across @xmath4 ( inset , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "for instance , although the major increase of @xmath88 occurs around 100120  k , its long tail extends up to @xmath15 160180  k. it should also be pointed out that the @xmath88 deduced does not saturate with cooling down to 10  k and is far smaller than the aligned moment of 12 @xmath13/ru ( 50100 emu/@xmath90 ) measured by nmr .",
    "this small and @xmath35-dependent @xmath88 ( _ i.e_. the superparamagnetic component ) suggests either a canted afm ground state or a phase - separation , _",
    "i.e. _ only a fraction of ru - spins are gradually fm - aligned .",
    "_ , however , have pointed out that the large canting angle , @xmath7 @xmath91 in our case , required would be rather unusual.@xcite the simplest scenario , therefore , would be an eventual precipitation of fm clusters from the paramagnetic matrix . both the unusual nonlinear @xmath5 far above @xmath4 and the relatively small @xmath88 can be self - consistently interpreted in this simple model",
    ".      the formation of clusters ( or strong short - range spin - spin correlations ) can be verified by the dynamic response of the sample .",
    "a slow dynamics should be characteristic of a magnetic system with energy barriers comparable to the thermal energy @xmath41 .",
    "the energy barrier ( @xmath92,@xcite which can be reduced to @xmath93 at low fields @xmath94 , is much smaller than @xmath41 in the case of paramagnets , but much larger in typical crystalline ferromagnets , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the anisotropy coefficient and the angle between @xmath26 and the easy axis , respectively . in either case ,",
    "the magnetic response to the changes of @xmath26 and @xmath35 will be either too fast or too slow to be observed in the experimental time - window .",
    "an observable slow dynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ a time - dependent response between 10 and @xmath97  s , implies energy barriers of 2040 times @xmath41 . in a system of isolated magnetic clusters , this corresponds to the existence of clusters with a @xmath43 on the order of @xmath98@xmath99  @xmath90 ( 10100    in diameter ) with @xmath100  erg/@xmath101  erg/@xmath90 ( values typical for ferromagnets ) .",
    "the dynamic magnetization of the ru1222eu , therefore , was measured above @xmath4 to verify the formation of clusters .",
    "first , the sample was cooled to a temperature between 60 and 100  k at zero field .",
    "a field of @xmath102  oe was added after the temperature was stabilized for 30 min .",
    "the @xmath25 @xmath27 was then continuously measured as a function of time @xmath103 , where @xmath103 is the time after the field is activated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]a )",
    ". a significant logarithmic increase of the magnetization with time exists over a broad temperature range .",
    "in particular , the rate @xmath104 is far larger than our experimental uncertainty of @xmath7  0.003 below 90  k. a logarithmic relaxation , in principle , may occur if either the related energy barrier @xmath105 has a particular distribution or a strong interparticle interaction exists.@xcite in both cases , however , the effective barrier ( at least its lower limit ) is @xmath106 $ ] @xmath7 @xmath107  j at 80 k , where @xmath108 is a characteristic time typically @xmath7  @xmath109  s. the @xmath43 @xmath7 @xmath110 ( in units of the fm moment involved ) , therefore , will be 700  @xmath13 with an estimated anisotropy field @xmath111 of 11  t , _ i.e. _ the anisotropy field observed in ru1212gd along @xmath10.@xcite it is interesting to note that the estimated value is in rough agreement with the size of @xmath112  @xmath11 from the langevin - function fit at the same temperature .",
    "second , the sample was cooled at an @xmath113  oe ( the field inhomogeneity is @xmath114  oe over the scanning length of 4  cm ) from 200  k to a designated temperature between 70 and 90  k with different cooling rates between 0.1 and @xmath7  50  k / min ( by mechanically dropping the sample into a precooled chamber ) .",
    "the @xmath28 under such conditions was then measured at 30-min intervals after the temperature was stabilized .",
    "the decrease of @xmath28 with the cooling rate at temperatures far above @xmath4 , a slow spin - alignment during the cooling , is again observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]b ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the above temperature range is where two additional transitions appear , and that part of the relaxation may be associated with the corresponding species .",
    "however , the large @xmath104 , as well as its smooth @xmath35-dependence below @xmath4 , where the additional species should be negligible , suggests that there should be a significant superparamagnetic component for the 65-k species as well .",
    "this is also supported by the slow @xmath23 dynamics in ru1222eu reported previously.@xcite      it should be noted that the linear term @xmath84 so - deduced from the langevin - function fit , which should be roughly equal to the differential susceptibility at 5  t in our case , offers another opportunity to verify the possible phase separations , _ i.e. _ a spatially separated matrix , from the clusters embedded .",

    "the ru seems to be a major contributor to the @xmath84 ( a similar conclusion has been reached previously@xcite ) .",

    "this is in agreement with the proposed model in which the homogenous paramagnetic ru1222 above @xmath6 eventually separates into fm clusters and a matrix on cooling .",
    "we further attribute the slight difference between these two ratios to local afm correlations developed in the matrix .",
    "the nonlinear isothermal @xmath5 and the non - c - w susceptibility up to 23  @xmath4 , therefore , can be consistently understood .",
    "both are similar to the data observed in manganites and can be self - consistently interpreted as the results of the fm clusters resulting from the possible phase separations",
    ".    an afm - like minimum appears around 120  k in the @xmath144 of the sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "afm correlations seem to develop quickly below this temperature .",
    "for example , the @xmath145 is only 10% or less of that expected from the c - w fit below 90  k. it should be pointed out that the @xmath88 at 90  k , _",
    "i.e. _ the total spins involved in the formation of the fm - like clusters , remains far smaller than the @xmath88(10  k ) of 17  emu/@xmath90 .",
    "the suppression of @xmath145 , therefore , should come mainly from the afm correlations of the matrix .",
    "fisher has proposed , on rather general grounds , that the magnetic specific heat is propotional to @xmath146 , and that the nel temperature corresponds to the inflection point @xmath147 in simple antiferromagnets.@xcite a numerical differential , therefore , was carried out .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath148 104  k so - deduced is almost double the @xmath149 65  k observed ( the arrow in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath8 differs from the 120-k dip by only 13% , characteristic of 3d spin ordering.@xcite it should also be pointed out that the large separation between the @xmath4 and the @xmath8 is not typical of the behavior of homogeneous canted afm magnets . for example , the @xmath28 onset and the peak of the differential susceptibility in cscocl@xmath53 , a 1d heisenberg canted antiferromagnet , occur at the same temperature , @xmath150  k , within the experimental resolution.@xcite ru1222eu , therefore , is unlikely to be a simple canted afm magnet with a single transition at @xmath4 . either several sequential magnetic transitions or",
    "a phase separation should have taken place .    at lower temperatures ,",
    "an fm - like transition occurs around @xmath4 at low fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is a puzzle , however , that there are no anomalies in either @xmath88 or @xmath84 around this temperature , as pointed out previously.@xcite to explore the nature of the @xmath4 transition , the remnant moment was measured in a @xmath32-@xmath26 loop of @xmath151  oe ( fig .  [ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is neither a remnant moment nor a significant hysteresis above @xmath4 , although a noticeable @xmath88 appears there already  a scenario reminiscent of superparamagnets above their blocking temperature .",
    "this is in agreement with the cluster size deduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "below @xmath4 , however , the remnant moment appears , and the @xmath28 at 100  oe becomes comparable to the @xmath88 deduced ( figs . [",
    "fig : fig3],[fig : fig5],[fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "a significant part of the fm component should possess a magnetic energy @xmath152 below @xmath4 , although a superparamagnetic component may still exist , as suggested by the slow dynamics . a long - range spin - order , therefore , is established at @xmath4 due either to a rapid growth of the cluster size or to a phase - coherent transition among adjacent clusters .",
    "the proposed model , in our opinion , can also offer possible explanations for many conflicting and confusing data previously reported .",
    "the conflict between the npd and nmr data for the magnetic structure , for example , may be attributed to the fact that the two probes have different sensitivities to various magnetic species .",
    "the npd , on one hand , is insensitive to the minor fm nanoclusters due to both the volume fraction , estimated to be @xmath7  10% for ru1212gd , and the submicron size of the clusters .",
    "the sensitivity of nmr ( as a @xmath153 transverse susceptibility ) , on the other hand , is small for afm ( inversely proportional to the exchange field ) , large for a single - domain fm ( inversely proportional to the anisotropy field ) , and even larger for fm domain - walls ( proportional to the wall mobility ) .",
    "the nmr data of ru1212/ru1222 , therefore , may be dominated by the minor fm part due to , for example , the small in - plane anisotropy field of @xmath7  200  oe observed.@xcite in fact , a similar ( though not as dramatic ) situation has been reported in la@xmath154ca@xmath155mno@xmath53 .",
    "when the zero - field nmr signal of the compound is dominated by the minor fm species with a volume fraction of @xmath7  8%,@xcite its npd data show a homogeneous afm structure.@xcite the different spin orientations assigned by npd ( _ i.e. _ , along the @xmath10-axis ) and by nmr ( _ i.e. _ , perpendicular to the @xmath10-axis ) can be naturally understood as well .",
    "similarly , the suppression of the superconducting order parameters inside the fm nanoclusters and the possible tunneling across them again offer a natural mechanism for the granular superconductivity observed.@xcite    two alternate interpretations have been proposed.@xcite it has been suggested that either ru1222 is already in a homogeneous canted afm state below @xmath6 ( a multi - transition model ) or that the fm components along the @xmath10- and the @xmath156-axes depend on @xmath26 very differently ( a two - stage spin - alignment model ) . in such models , however , several features are expected .",
    "a ) an anomaly of @xmath145 as well as an @xmath88 jump are expected around @xmath6 , where a bulk transition occurs .",
    "in fact , the @xmath145 is determined by the c - w law above @xmath6 , but by the magnetic anisotropy and/or the ca nt angle below @xmath6 in such models .",
    "similarly , @xmath88 should be zero above @xmath6 but should be determined by the canted angle , @xmath96 , below @xmath6 .",
    "these two totally different mechanisms make the smooth crossovers around @xmath6 purely coincidental .",
    "experimentally , no discontinuity or anomaly has ever been reported around @xmath6 , although both @xmath6 and @xmath157 can be tuned significantly through doping and oxidation.@xcite b ) the @xmath88 and the @xmath145 should be related between @xmath6 and @xmath4 through @xmath96 and/or the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "their very different @xmath35-dependences in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig8 ] , therefore , will require rather peculiar temperature dependences of the @xmath96 and/or the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "c ) the fm - like transition at @xmath4 as well as the afm - like one at @xmath8 will be `` extra '' features in such models .",
    "the situation in ru1212eu is slightly different .",
    "however , we believe that similar arguments apply .",
    "nonlinear @xmath5 , non - c - w behavior , and slow spin dynamics have been observed in a ru1222eu sample between @xmath158  k and @xmath159  k , suggesting the formation of superparamagnetic clusters @xmath160@xmath112 @xmath11 in size .",
    "additionally , the differential susceptibility @xmath145 shows an afm transition at @xmath8 @xmath7 104  k. we therefore propose a phase - separation model : the sample is a mesoscopic mixture of fm clusters and a paramagnetic matrix between @xmath6 and @xmath4 , followed by an afm transition of the matrix at @xmath8 and a long - range phase - coherent transition in the imbedded clusters at @xmath4 .",
    "this model offers a possible interpretation for many conflicting data , but it needs to be verified by further structure investigations .",
