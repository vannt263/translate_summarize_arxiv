    "ergodic theory and topological dynamics are two branches of the larger subject of dynamical systems .",
    "the basic setup of a dynamical system in ergodic theory is to have @xmath2 a measure - preserving transformation acting on a probability space @xmath3 .",
    "if we want to work with more generality , we can replace the transformation @xmath2 with @xmath4 , a measurable group action on @xmath5 .    in topological dynamics ,",
    "we no longer require our underlying space to be a measure space , but instead to be a topological space . in this setup ,",
    "our topological system is @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is a compact , usually metrizable , space is compact and metrizable mirrors the restriction that @xmath5 is a probability space in the setting of ergodic theory .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper , we will usually work in more generality and only assume that @xmath5 is second countable .",
    "] and @xmath4 a topological group acting continuously on @xmath5 , so that the map @xmath7 is continuous .",
    "we will always implicitly make the assumption that both @xmath5 and @xmath4 are hausdorff .",
    "furthermore , we will generally take @xmath4 to also be locally compact , and second countable .",
    "although ergodic theory and topological dynamics are different fields with their own theories , many concepts that are used to describe dynamical systems make an appearance in both fields ( e.g. recurrence , periodicity , mixing , chaos ) .",
    "in addition , many of the results involving these ideas hold in both fields ( see @xcite ) .    for example , various notions of mixing exist in both the measurable and topological settings . in both ergodic theory and topological dynamics , there are notions of strong and weak mixing and in both theories ,",
    "a well - known result is that strong mixing implies weak mixing .",
    "in ergodic theory , it is also known that given sufficient conditions on the system , a weak mixing system is  almost \" strong mixing , for some notion of  almost \" that we will make more precise in the next section .",
    "we can then ask if a similar statement can be made in the context of topological dynamics .",
    "this then leads us to the motivating question of this paper : when is a topological weak mixing system  almost \" strong mixing ?",

    "we notice here that in the above theorem , the density one set @xmath15 may depend on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "however , under the extra condition that there exists countable basis for @xmath3 , we can remove the dependence on the sets @xmath16 and @xmath17 :    [ thm : mdo2 ] let @xmath2 be a measure - preserving transformation on a probability space @xmath3 with a countable basis .",
    "then , @xmath2 is weak mixing if and only if there exists of density one set @xmath12 such that for all @xmath9 , @xmath14    our goal is now to find a similar result in the context of topological dynamics",
    ". we will formalize the statement of the problem that we will be looking at in the next section .      in topological dynamics ,",
    "we generally begin with @xmath5 a compact , metrizable space and @xmath4 a locally compact , second countable topological group that acts on @xmath5 .",
    "we say then that @xmath6 is * ( topologically ) weak mixing * if for any choice of four non - empty open sets @xmath18 , there exists a @xmath19 for which @xmath20 furthermore , we say that @xmath6 is * ( topologically ) strong mixing * if for any two non - empty open sets @xmath21 , there exists a compact subset @xmath22 for which @xmath23 as in the measurable setting , we can see that if @xmath4 is not compact , then topological strong mixing implies topological weak mixing . if @xmath4 is compact , then @xmath6 is trivially strong mixing .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will only consider the actions of noncompact groups @xmath4 .",
    "to find an analogues of theorems [ thm : mdo1 ] and [ thm : mdo2 ] , we need a notion similar to density one in the context of general groups .",

    "we can hope also for an analogue of theorem [ thm : mdo2 ] in the topological setting . for a topological system @xmath6 ,",

    "we note here that saying that @xmath43 is mixing is a slight abuse of notation as @xmath44 may not be a group",
    ". however , we understand this to mean that for every pair of nonempty open sets @xmath42 , there exists a compact set @xmath45 such that @xmath39 for all @xmath46 .",
    "now , the problem that we will investigate becomes the following :    * problem statement : * for what conditions on @xmath5 and @xmath4 does weak mixing of the system @xmath6 imply that it is also thick strong mixing ?    the main result of this paper will be the equivalence of @xmath1-transitivity for all @xmath1 and thick strong mixing .",

    "we will show that weak mixing does not always imply thick strong mixing for nonabelian groups , and will give a characterization of when an analogue of theorem [ thm : mdo1 ] holds in topological dynamics .",
    "before we begin classifying for which topological systems weak mixing implies thick strong mixing , it is first good to know that there exist systems that are not strong mixing , but are weak mixing and thick strong mixing . in particular , we will look at the chacn system . in proving that the chacn system is thick strong mixing",
    ", we will use some techniques that we will build on in our proof of the equivalence of @xmath1-transitivity for all @xmath1 and thick strong mixing .",
    "we start with a quick overview of shift systems .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be the * full shift space * on @xmath54 letters , the space of all bi - infinite sequences on the alphabet @xmath55 .",
    "as we are thinking of elements in @xmath56 as strings , we will use the notation @xmath57 to denote the substring consisting of the letters @xmath58 .",

    "that is , we have that @xmath65 where @xmath66 for all @xmath67 .",
    "thinking of shifts as as a @xmath51 action , we have then defined the shift system @xmath68 .",
    "if instead of working with the whole space @xmath56 , we work with some closed shift - invariant subspace @xmath5 , we can also define the * subshift system * @xmath50 . in the next section",
    ", we will explicitly define one such subshift system , the chacn system .      to construct the chacn system ,",
    "we inductively define blocks @xmath69 by : @xmath70 we can think of this as beginning with @xmath71 and in each stage , defining @xmath72 from @xmath73 by making the substitutions @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in this way , the system we will construct will also be a * substitution system*.    now , we define an @xmath76 by for each @xmath77 , setting @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the length of @xmath69 . then , we define a left - shift transformation @xmath63 on @xmath80 by @xmath81 where @xmath82 . defining @xmath83 , the closure of the set of all ( left and right ) shifts of @xmath64 , under the topology where the basis elements are the cylinder sets in @xmath84 , we define the * chacn system * as @xmath50 .    while it is known that the chacn system is weak mixing but not strong mixing , we give proofs of these facts here to familiarize ourselves with this important example .",
    "we will also show that the chacn system is thick strong mixing . to see this , we first do some preliminary investigation into the intersections of cylinder sets in the chacn system :    for any string in @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , the cylinder set @xmath87_k$ ] is the set of all @xmath88 for which @xmath61 for all @xmath62 .",

    "this idea of building up out thick set @xmath44 from larger and larger pieces of the thick sets @xmath193 will be a key component of our proofs in later sections .",
    "we say that a system @xmath6 is * transitive * if for any two nonempty open sets @xmath42 , there exists a @xmath19 such that @xmath39 .",

    ", we again have that the action of the whole group is weak mixing , but the action of the subgroup is not because these transformations are somehow  orientation preserving \" .    while weak mixing does not pass down to finite index subgroups even in the case of countable groups , we will see that thick strong mixing does pass down , as a result of the following lemma :    if @xmath4 is @xmath457-transitive , then every subgroup of index @xmath176 is @xmath1-transitive .    from this , the equivalence of @xmath1-transitivity for all @xmath1 and thick strong mixing , and that @xmath1-transitivity on a subgroup implies @xmath1-transitivity on the whole group , we have the immediate consequence :    for topological systems @xmath6 where @xmath5 is second countable , hausdorff and @xmath4 is hausdorff , second countable , locally compact but not compact , then if @xmath24 is a finite index subgroup    * @xmath6 is @xmath1-transitive for all @xmath1 if and only if @xmath43 is @xmath1-transitive for all @xmath1 . * as a consequence , if @xmath6 is thick strong mixing if and only if @xmath43 is thick strong mixing .",
    "this shows that even though weak mixing does not necessarily pass down to finite index subgroups , the stronger property of thick strong mixing on the whole group is equivalent to being thick strong mixing on any finite index subgroup .",
    "we started out by trying to find an analogue of the result in topological dynamics of the result in ergodic theory that under sufficient conditions on the system , a weak mixing transformation is strong mixing on a density one subset of @xmath11 .",
    "as density can sometimes be difficult to define on general groups , we replaced the notion of density one with that of thickness .",
    "we called this idea of being strong mixing on a thick subset thick strong mixing and showed that thick strong mixing was equivalent to @xmath1-transitivity for all @xmath1 .",
    "this allowed us to conclude that for abelian groups , weak mixing was equivalent to thick strong mixing . in the @xmath51 case , this mirrored the result from ergodic theory that was our motivation .",
    "from there , we moved on to find examples to show that weak mixing was not equivalent to thick strong mixing for nonabelian groups .",
    "we then asked if there existed a larger class of groups than abelian groups for which weak mixing was equivalent to thick strong mixing .",
    "in particular , we looked at virtually abelian and nilpotent groups . while the methods we used to investigate this question were unsuccessful , they led us down a path that allowed us to conclude that weak mixing did not pass down to finite index subgroups as was the case in ergodic theory , but that thick strong mixing did .",

    "we can ask then if there exists a classification of the nonabelian groups for which weak mixing implies thick strong mixing .",
