    "baryonic resonances play a major role in the understanding of reactions that take place in nucleons and nuclei in the so - called intermediate energy regime @xcite . in particular",
    ", the low - lying nucleonic resonances @xmath1(1232 ) and @xmath2(1440 ) , can be now analyzed in more detail due to the development of specific experimental programs in tjnaf , uppsala ...    in this context the transition , @xmath3  ( @xmath4 : resonance ) , and direct @xmath5 and @xmath6 interactions should be understood .",
    "usually these interactions have been written as straightforward extensions of some pieces of the @xmath7 potential with the modification of the values of the coupling constants , extracted from their decay widths . though this procedure can be appropriate for the very long - range part of the interaction , it is under suspicion at least for the short - range part for which the detailed structure of the baryons may determine to some extent the form of the interaction .",
    "this turns out to be the case for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 potentials previously analyzed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore convenient to proceed to a derivation of these potentials based on the more elementary quark - quark interaction .",
    "this is the purpose of this talk : starting from a quark - quark non - relativistic interaction , we implement the baryon structure through technically simple gaussian wave functions and we calculate the potential at the baryonic level in the static born - oppenheimer approach .",
    "the @xmath10 , the roper resonance , considered as a radial excitation of the nucleon , is taken as a stable particle . for dynamical applications its width should be implemented through the coupling to the continuum .",
    "we center our attention in the @xmath11 potential where a complete parallelism with the @xmath7 case can be easily established .",
    "notice that the quark - quark interaction parameters are fixed ( from the @xmath7 case ) and are kept independent of the baryons involved in the interaction .",
    "this eliminates the bias introduced in models at the baryonic level by a different choice of effective parameters according to the baryon - baryon interaction considered ( this effectiveness of the parameters may hide distinct physical effects ) .",
    "the wave function of a two - baryon system , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with a definite symmetry under the exchange of the baryon quantum numbers is written as @xcite :    @xmath14_{st }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( -1)^{f } \\ , \\biggr\\ { \\left [ b_2 \\left ( 123;{-{\\frac{{\\vec r } } { 2 } } } \\right ) b_1 \\left ( 456 ; { \\frac{{\\vec r } } { 2 } } \\right ) \\right]_{st } \\biggr \\ } \\ , ,   \\label{gor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    being @xmath15 the six - quark antisymmetrizer given by : @xmath16    where @xmath17 exchanges the three quarks between the two clusters and @xmath18 exchanges quarks @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    if one projects on a state of definite orbital angular momentum @xmath21 , due to the @xmath22 operator in the antisymmetrizer the wave function @xmath23 vanishes unless :    @xmath24    since @xmath25 , @xmath26 , this fixes the relative phase between the two components of the wave function at eq .",
    "( [ gor ] ) to be :    @xmath27    it is important to realize that for the @xmath28 system @xmath29 is necessarily even in order to prevent the vanishing of the wave function .",
    "no such restriction exists for @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath30 channels ( @xmath29 odd ) with no counterpart in the @xmath28 case .",
    "we will assume the three - quark wave function for the quark clusters at a position @xmath31 to be given by    @xmath32(0s)^3\\rangle\\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath33(0s)^2(1s)\\rangle -\\sqrt{1\\over3 } |[3](0s)(op)^2\\rangle \\ , , \\ ] ]    explicitly , @xmath34_{st } \\otimes [ 1^{3}]_{c } \\ , , \\ ] ]    and @xmath35_{st}\\otimes[1 ^ 3]_c \\ , , \\ ] ]    being @xmath36",
    "\\prod_{i=1}^3 e^{-{\\frac { ( \\vec{r}_{i}- \\vec{r})^2 } { 2 b^{2 } } } } , \\ ] ]    and @xmath37 where @xmath38_{st}$ ] and @xmath39_{c}$ ] stand for the spin - isospin and color part , respectively . the validity of the harmonic oscillator wave functions to calculate the two - baryon interaction has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the quark - quark potential we use can be written in terms of the interquark distance @xmath40 as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the confining potential , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for one - gluon , one - pion and one - sigma exchange potentials , respectively .",
    "the expression of these potentials has been very much detailed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the baryon - baryon potential is obtained as the expectation value of the energy of the six - quark system minus the self - energy of the two clusters .",
    "the presence of the antisymmetrization in the two - baryon wave function has also an important dynamical effect , the baryon - baryon potential contains quark - exchange contributions where the interaction takes place between two baryons that exchange a quark .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] we show the results for the @xmath0 potential in terms of the interbaryon distance r for two channels : @xmath46 , which is forbidden in the @xmath28 system , and the @xmath47 , which is allowed in the @xmath28 system . in this last case ,",
    "the result is quite close to the corresponding channel in the @xmath28 system , a consequence of the near to identity similarity of @xmath48 and @xmath2 . as can be seen , the behavior in the two previous channels is completely different such that it could not be obtained by a simple rescaling of the vertex coupling constants from one case to the other . in order to emphasize the effects of quark antisymmetrization , we have compared to a direct potential without quark - exchange contributions .",
    "we have also separated the contribution of the different terms of the quark - quark potential in eq .",
    "[ pot ]    as general features of the results we may remark that the ope interaction determines the very long range behavior ( r@xmath494 fm ) , the ope altogether with the ose are responsible for the long - range par ( 1.5 fm @xmath50 r @xmath50 4 fm ) , and ope , ose and oge added to quark - exchange determine the attractive or repulsive character of the interaction at the intermediate- and short - range .",
    "certainly data on @xmath51 phase shifts can be only obtained indirectly and no direct experimental test of our results can actually be performed .",
    "nonetheless , our results should help to a better understanding of baryonic processes at a microscopic level and serve as a guide when dealing with reactions where some indicative predictions are needed in theoretical as well as in experimental studies . the elastic @xmath52 scattering above the roper threshold as well as the breakup of the deuteron into @xmath0 channels ,",
    "although not available for the moment , should serve as a test of the results we have derived .",
    "a transition potential @xmath53 can also be derived within the same framework .",
    "althought this transition does not show forbidden channels , the quantum numbers are fixed by the @xmath28 system , the quark model provides a parameter - free prediction .",
    "this potential can be tested in several reactions @xcite .",
    "we have determined the @xmath0(1440 ) probability on the deuteron by means of a multichannel calculation including : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , finding for the roper components 0.003@xmath62 and 0.024@xmath62 , respectively , much lower than the @xmath63 ones ( @xmath64 0.25@xmath62 ) .",
    "we thank to d. r. entem for the calculations on the deuteron ."
