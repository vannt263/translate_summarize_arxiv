    "communities of ecologically similar species that compete with each other solely for resources are often described by neutral community models ( ncm ) @xcite .",
    "these models proved to be successful and useful in describing many of the basic patterns of biodiversity such as the distribution of abundance , distribution of range , the range - abundance relation and the species - area relation @xcite .",
    "the neutral theory is considered by many ecologists as a radical shift from established niche theories and generated considerable controversy @xcite .",
    "the relevance of ncm for describing the dynamics and statistics of real communities is still much debated and criticized @xcite .",
    "nowadays ncm are studied mostly by monte carlo type computer simulations @xcite , and apparently there are no analytical results .",
    "one of the key issues that macro - ecologist are often investigating is the species abundances distribution ( sad ) , introduced for characterizing the frequency of species with a given abundance @xcite . in case of ncm ,",
    "sad is generated numerically and it is called the zero sum multinomial ( zsm ) distribution @xcite . the aim of the present paper is to give an analytical mean - field type approximation for zsm . by using the invariance of the system against the intrinsic fluctuations characteristic for ncm , we derive an analytic solution that describes the results of computer simulations .",
    "the derived analytical form of sad leads also an interesting relation between the total number of individuals , total number of species and the size of the most abundant species of the considered meta - community .",
    "this novel scaling relation is confirmed by computer simulations on neutral models .",
    "ncm are usually defined on lattice sites , on which a given number of @xmath0 species can coexist @xcite and compete for resources . each lattice site can be occupied by many individuals belonging to different species , however the total number of individuals for each lattice site is limited to a fixed @xmath1 value .",
    "this limiting value models the finite amount of available resources in a given territory .",
    "as time passes individuals in the system can give birth to individuals belonging to the same species , can die or can migrate to a nearby site .",
    "the neutrality of the model implies that all individuals ( regardless of the species they belong ) are considered to be equally fit for the given ecosystem , and have thus the same @xmath2 multiplication , @xmath3 death and @xmath4 diffusion rate .",
    "the system is considered also in contact with a reservoir , from where with a small @xmath5 probability per unit time an individual from a randomly chosen species can be assigned to a randomly chosen lattice site .",
    "this effect models the random fluctuations that can happen in the abundances of species .",
    "the dynamics of the considered community is than as follows :    * a given number of individuals from randomly chosen species are assigned on randomly chosen lattice sites . * with the initially fixed probabilities we allow each individual to give birth to another individual of the same species , to die or to migrate on a nearby site .",
    "* we constantly verify the saturation condition on each site .",
    "once the number of individuals on a site exceeds the @xmath1 value , a randomly chosen individual is removed from that site .",
    "* we apply the random fluctuations resulting from the reservoir .    after on each lattice site saturation",
    "is achieved a dynamical equilibrium sets in , and one can study the statistical properties of several relevant quantities .",
    "computer simulations usually focus on generating sad and on studying several scaling relations like species - area and range - abundance relations .",
    "let us consider a fixed area in a ncm ( a delimited region in the lattice ) on which we study sad . in the selected area",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the number of species with size @xmath7 at the time - moment @xmath8 .",
    "( @xmath7 is a discrete variable @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xmath6 divided by the total number of species yields the mathematically rigorously defined sad ( species abundances distribution ) .",
    "we mention here that in most of the papers dealing with sad , instead of this rigorously defined distribution function a histogram on intervals increasing as a power of 2 is constructed @xcite . on a log - normal scale",
    "this histogram usually has a gaussian shape , and thus sad is called a log - normal distribution . without arguing on the relevance of this histogram ( a nice treatment on this subject is given by may @xcite ) for the sake of mathematical simplicity we will not use this representation , and calculate instead the mathematically rigorous distribution function .",
    "it is of course anytime possible to re - plot the obtained distribution function in the form that is usually used by ecologists , using instead of the @xmath7 variable the @xmath10 variable .    in the framework of the considered model the time evolution of @xmath6 for an infinitesimally short @xmath11 time",
    "can be approximated by the following master - equation :    @xmath12dt \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the equation from above @xmath13 denotes the probability that one species with size @xmath7 increases its size to @xmath14 in unit time and @xmath15 denotes the probability that one species with size @xmath7 decreases it s size to @xmath16 in unit time .",
    "we neglected here the possibility that in the small @xmath11 time - interval one species increases or decreases it s size by more than one individual .",
    "the value of @xmath11 can be always taken as small , as needed so that this starting assumption should hold .",
    "it worth also mentioning that this master equation is not applicable in the neighborhood of the limiting values of @xmath7 since here either @xmath16 or @xmath14 is not existing .",
    "we expect thus that the shape of sad determined from ( [ master ] ) can have problems for very low and very high values of @xmath7 .",
    "we assume now that sad reaches a steady - state in time .",
    "all computer simulations on neutral models shows that this is true .",
    "this means that @xmath6 should be time invariant in respect of the fluctuation governed by equation ( [ master ] ) . under this stationarity assumption",
    "we get the equation :    @xmath17    we have to approximate now the @xmath13 and @xmath15 probabilities .",
    "we will work with the assumptions of the ncm , and consider all species having the same birth , death and migration rate .",
    "let us denote by @xmath18 the probability that one individual multiplies itself in unit time ( we assume @xmath18 is the same for all individuals and species ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath19 the probability that one individual disappears from the considered territory in unit time ( again the same for all individuals and species ) .",
    "further we assume that : @xmath20    by simple probability theory we get : @xmath21^{x-1 } \\label{w+}\\ ] ]    the above equation tells us , that the increase by unity of the size of one species can be realized if any of the @xmath7 individual from a selected species multiplies itself , while the other individuals remain unchanged .",
    "( of course there are many other possibilities involving the birth and death of more than one individual . however , since we considered the ( [ assum ] ) assumption all other possibilities will be with orders of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that for the selected local community the effect of migration and the stochastic contribution from the reservoir can be taken into account through the birth and death processes , changing slightly the values of this probabilities .",
    "migration inside the considered area is equivalent with a birth process , while migration outside from the considered territory is equivalent with death of individuals .    using the assumptions ( [ assum ] ) we can make now",
    "the following approximations : @xmath22^{x-1 } = x p_+ [ 1-(p_++p_-)]^{[1/(p_++p_- ) ] \\cdot ( p_++p_-)(x-1 ) } \\approx   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\approx xp_+e^{-(p_++p_-)(x-1 ) } \\label{am}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the same manner , one can write : @xmath23^{x-1 } \\approx x p_-e^{-(p_++p_-)(x-1 ) } \\label{ap}\\ ] ]    instead of @xmath18 and @xmath19 we introduce now two new notations : @xmath24    from where : @xmath25    from the assumptions ( [ assum ] ) it is clear that it also holds : @xmath26    let us assume now that @xmath27 which would mean that the probability of multiplication and death is the same , so there is a constant number of individuals in the considered local community .",
    "in other words this means that the territory is saturated , and although the size of different species fluctuates , the total number @xmath28 of population is constant .",
    "the probability density for the species abundances distribution ( sad ) is given than as : @xmath29    instead of @xmath7 let us introduce now a new variable @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the total number of individuals in the system )    for @xmath32 we have the ( [ form ] ) equation :    @xmath33    since @xmath32 is a limiting distribution ( not depending on @xmath8 anymore ) we will simply denote is as @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35    we can use now taylor series expansion to get @xmath36 and @xmath37 :    @xmath38    we denoted here by @xmath39 and @xmath40 the first and second order derivatives of the @xmath34 function , respectively . taking account of @xmath41 , the values of @xmath42 are given by ( [ am ] , [ ap ] ) as follows :    @xmath43    \\\\",

    "this yields a first order differential equation :    @xmath51    this equation has the immediate solution    @xmath52    with @xmath53 an integration constant .",
    "the histogram @xmath54 that is usually used for sad can be immediately determined from ( [ app1 ] ) , writing the @xmath55 distribution as a function of the @xmath56 variable .",
    "it is immediate to realize that this would yield a constant distribution ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "a * better approximation * can be achieved by keeping the terms proportional with @xmath58 and neglecting the second orderly small @xmath59 and @xmath60 terms .",
    "this yields the    @xmath61 + \\rho''(y)\\frac{1}{2n_t } y = 0\\ ] ]    differential equation .",
    "going back now to the @xmath62 variable    @xmath63 + \\rho ' ' ( x ) \\frac{x}{2 } = 0,\\ ] ]    we get the general solution    @xmath64    where @xmath53 and @xmath65 are two integration constants .    by visually comparing with the experimental and simulated sad curves",
    "we can conclude that we need @xmath66 and @xmath67 to get the right shape . the general solution for sad ,",
    "should write thus    @xmath68    with @xmath69 and @xmath70 two real , positive constants .",
    "it is immediate to observe that the obtained distribution for sad , has a cutoff , i.e. there is a maximum value of @xmath7 until @xmath71 is acceptable ( remains positive ) .",
    "this results , is not surprising , since due to the finite number of individuals in the system and the finite value of the number of species one would naturally expect a cutoff in the distribution .",
    "there are three fitting parameters in the mathematical expression of @xmath72 ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "since @xmath72 has to be normalized , we can determine @xmath69 as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath73 .",
    "the normalization of this distribution function is not easy and can not be done analytically , since there is no primitive function for @xmath74 .",
    "however , if we can use the @xmath75 assumption and consider a taylor expansion in the exponential we obtain the more simple @xmath76 ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 are again two positive real constants ) distribution , which has a cutoff for @xmath79 .",
    "this distribution function is exactly the same as the one proposed by dewdney using totally different arguments @xcite , and named _",
    "logistic - j distribution_. as argued in @xcite it describes well the sad for many real communities .",
    "the normalization condition for this distribution function is : @xmath80 and an immediate calculus gives : @xmath81    the approximated normalized distribution function for sad is then :    @xmath82    we can consider thus the above simple one - parameter fit to approximate the results for sad on ncm .    the shape of @xmath83 can be again quickly obtained from @xmath72 , by changing the variable in this distribution function to @xmath10 .",
    "a simple calculation yields the form @xmath84 where c is another normalization constant .",
    "it is important to realize , that @xmath83 given by the above approximation does not show the generally observed bell shaped curve , and for small values of @xmath85 it is a constant .",
    "we must remember however that the shape of sad given by our approximation can not be trusted for small @xmath85 values , since in this limit the starting master equation ( [ master ] ) is not valid .",
    "in order to check the validity of our analytical approximation for sad we performed computer simulations on the model presented in section 2 .",
    "we considered a lattice of size @xmath86 , @xmath87 species , and @xmath88 for each lattice site .",
    "we studied a local community on a square of @xmath89 lattice sites , and we fixed several values for the dynamical parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we used periodic boundary conditions , and the efficient kinetic or resident time monte carlo algorithm was implemented .",
    "the simulations were made on a @xmath92 cluster . as a general results",
    ", we obtained that the analytical form given by ( [ result ] ) describes well the simulation data for sad . on figure 1",
    "we present a characteristic fit for the simulation data .",
    "the parameters used in the simulation were @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the obtained best fit parameter for equation ( [ result ] ) was @xmath95 .",
    "the rigorously defined @xmath71 distribution function suggest that in ncm sad has a scale - invariant nature .",
    "the finite size of the system introduces a natural cutoff in this scale - invariant behavior .",
    "computer simulations on ncm proves thus the applicability of our analytical approximations for the form of the zsm distribution .",
    "starting from the analytical approximation ( [ result ] ) for the form of sad , we can derive an interesting relation between the size of the most abundant species ( @xmath96 ) , the total number of individuals ( @xmath28 ) and the number of detected species ( @xmath97 ) in the considered meta - community .",
    "the distribution function ( [ result ] ) has a cutoff at @xmath79 , from where it results that @xmath98 .",
    "it is also immediate to realize that from the definition of @xmath71 it results @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a normalization constant , which normalizes @xmath71 to the total number of species in the local community .",
    "the above two integrals are easily calculated and leads to the following two coupled differential equations : @xmath101 working on relatively large habitats , one can use the @xmath102 assumption , and the coupled equation system from above can be simplified : @xmath103 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eliminating from this system the normalization constant @xmath100 we obtain the important relation : @xmath104}=2 \\label{magic}\\ ] ]    computer simulation results on ncm supports again the validity of the magic formula from above .",
    "( the simulations were made on a @xmath86 lattice , and we choose @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) . on figure 2",
    "we plotted the simulation results for different local community sizes , and the plot shows that equation ( [ magic ] ) works well , however the constant on the right side of the equation seems to be slightly different from 2 .",
    "we think that this slight difference is the result of our crude approximation : @xmath98 , and in reality we should have @xmath78 slightly bigger than @xmath96 .",
    "the simulation data from figure 2 was obtained after averaging on several local communities of size @xmath105 .    increasing the size @xmath105 of the considered habitat one would naturally expect @xmath106 .",
    "using equation ( [ magic ] ) one would immediately get thus the interesting scaling - law :    @xmath107    the ( [ scaling ] ) scaling relation can be also immediately verified in computer simulations on ncm .",

    "on the figure with a dashed line we indicated the power - law with exponent @xmath108 .",
    "as seen from the figure , the simulation data supports the scaling - law given by our analytical approach .",
