    "concave and convex billiards as prototypes of conservative chaotic systems have received a growing theoretical and experimental interest in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics [ 1 ] .",
    "these billiards are nowadays fabricated as quantum dots or antidots in ballistic microstructures where the system size is much less than the mean free path @xmath0 m ) and larger than the fermi wavelength ( @xmath1nm)[2 ] .",
    "since the striking experiments on the magneto - conductance of nanoscale stadium and circle billiards with a pair of conducting leads [ 2 ] , quantum transport phenomena have been intensively investigated [ 3 ] .",
    "some salient features of experiments well agreed with the semiclassical theory , where a semiclassical conductance formula was derived for two - dimensional ( 2-d ) chaotic billiards by combining the semiclassical green function with the landauer formula [ 4,5 ] .",
    "subsequently , the semiclassical conductance formula was extended for integrable 2-d billiards [ 6 ] , and detailed numerical computation on circle billiards indicated that the conductance also depends on the lead orientation [ 7 ] .",
    "recently , the dependence of the conductance on the lead orientation was found experimentally in a ballistic square billiard [ 8 ] .    at present , another important object of research on quantum transport is the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) billiard [ 9 ] .",
    "the ballistic 3-d quantum dots will be fabricated , for instance , by exploiting drying etching processess with focused - ion beams applied to @xmath2 @xmath3 double hetero - structures , which will be less than both the elastic mean free path and phase coherence length .",
    "the subject of this paper is to extend the semiclassical conductance formula for 2-d billiards to 3-d billiards and to investigate the quantum transport in open 3-d billiards from a viewpoint of the arnold diffusion , a key concept in high - dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "while arnold diffusion is a classical phenomenon , an anomalous phenomenon like this in classical mechanics should have a quantum counterpart , which can only be analytically revealed by using the semiclassical theory .",
    "the conductance for open 3-d billiards connected to a pair of rectangular parallel - piped lead wires can be expressed by the transmission coefficient @xmath4 as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the * s*-matrix element between the incoming mode @xmath7 and the outgoing mode @xmath8 , and the double summation is taken over all propagating modes .",
    "the transmission amplitude connecting those modes at the fermi energy @xmath9 reads as [ 10,11 ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the longitudinal velocities of electrons for the incoming and outgoing modes , respectively . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the @xmath15 coordinates for the transverse ( @xmath16 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath17 ) directions ( inward the billiard for @xmath18 and outward for @xmath19 ) of the incoming and outgoing leads , respectively , and @xmath20 is the green function for an electron propagating from the entrance to the exit . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the transverse components of the wave functions at the leads . to simplify the problem , the cross section of the leads is assumed to be a square with side length @xmath23",
    ". then @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the ballistic regime ,",
    "the green function from entrance ( @xmath26 ) to exit ( @xmath27 ) can be replaced by the gutzwiller semiclassical path - integral expression [ 12 ] @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the action and maslov index for a trajectory @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the above semiclassical green function was widely applied to derive the level density of both chaotic and regular billiards [ 12,13 ] . here , to avoid direct transmission without any bouncing at the billiard wall we may place a stopper inside the billiard .    in the integration in eq.(1 ) we introduce the entrance angle @xmath32 between the initial direction of the orbit and the @xmath18 axis , and the angle @xmath33 between the projection of the initial direction onto the @xmath34 plane and the @xmath35 axis .",
    "angles @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined for the exit in the same way .",
    "then , we can rewrite @xmath38 for each trajectory @xmath30 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 . for large mode numbers",
    ", the integration over the transverse coordinates in eq.(1 ) can be performed in the stationary - phase approximation , and the transmission amplitude becomes @xmath41 with @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&[\\sin2\\varphi^ { ' } ( \\frac{\\partial\\theta^{'}}{\\partial{y}^{'}}\\frac{\\partial\\theta^ { ' } } { \\partial{x}^{'}}\\cos^2 \\theta^{'}- \\frac{\\partial\\varphi^{'}}{\\partial{y}^{'}}\\frac{\\partial\\varphi^ { ' } } { \\partial{x}^{'}}\\sin^2\\theta^ { ' } ) + \\sin2\\theta^ { ' } ( \\frac{\\partial\\varphi^{'}}{\\partial{y}^{'}}\\frac{\\partial\\theta^ { ' } } { \\partial{x}^{'}}\\cos^2\\varphi^{'}- \\frac{\\partial\\theta^{'}}{\\partial{y}^{'}}\\frac{\\partial\\varphi^ { ' } } { \\partial{x}^{'}}\\sin^2\\varphi^{'})]|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43,@xmath44 , @xmath45,@xmath46 , and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the maslov index which includes an extra phase coming from the possible sign change in each of the four fresnel integrals .",
    "the above result means that only those isolated trajectories connecting a pair of transverse planes at discrete angles @xmath49 , and @xmath50 dominate the conductance .    using eqs.(3,4 )",
    ", we shall first analyze a completely chaotic 3-d billiard with a pair of conducting leads . in this case",
    ", the electron injected from the incoming lead will bounce at the billiard boundary in an ergodic way before reaching the exit , leading to amplitudes of the same order for both transmission and reflection coefficients . in the large mode number case ,",
    "the summations over modes are replaced by integrations and the transmission coefficient @xmath51 is rewritten as @xmath52 noting the dimension of @xmath53 to be @xmath54 , and using the diagonal approximation , the above integration can be evaluated as @xmath55 .",
    "the conductance for 3-d chaotic billiards is thus given by @xmath56 without any dependence on the lead orientations .",
    "however , the situation will be dramatically changed for the case of completely or partially broken - ergodic 3-d billiards . as examples",
    ", we choose so(2)-symmetric billiards : a completely integrable (: broken - ergodic ) 3-d billiard is available by rotating , e.g. , the 2-d ellipse billiard ( on the @xmath57 plane ) around the @xmath58 axis ( see fig.1 ) . note : @xmath59 are the @xmath60 coordinates ; a partially broken - ergodic 3-d billiard is also available in a similar way by rotating , e.g. , the 2-d stadium .",
    "all these so(2)-symmetric 3-d billiards have the angular momentum @xmath61 as a constant of motion . in an open system version of each of these billiards , one may place in its inside a smaller stopper of the similar shape , to avoid direct transmission of electrons .",
    "the resultant 3-d @xmath62 billiards still retain the so(2 ) symmetry .",
    "firstly , consider the vertical case ( i ) when the incoming and outgoing leads are connected with the billiard vertically at points @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "electrons to reach the exit @xmath64 should have the vanishing angular momentum , @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , only the electrons with the initial velocity vector at the entrance @xmath63 lying in the @xmath57 plane can reach @xmath64 because of the conservation of @xmath61 ; other incoming electrons falling into the trajectories out of this plane can not reach @xmath64 and should return to @xmath63 . in deriving the transmission coefficient for this lead orientation , the integration prior to eq.(5 )",
    "is reduced to the line integration    over @xmath32 and @xmath36 only , yielding the conductance @xmath66 ( linear in @xmath67 ! ) .",
    "( the reflection    coefficient , which is obtained by applying the same procedure as in the chaotic billiard , is proportional to @xmath68 . )",
    "we shall then consider the parallel case ( ii ) when the incoming and outgoing leads are parallelly placed at points @xmath69 and @xmath64 , respectively ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "each electron incoming from the entrance @xmath69 has the vanishing angular momentum , @xmath65 , and thereby can reach @xmath64 or return to @xmath69 with probability of the same order .",
    "therefore , for this lead orientation , @xmath70 .    generally , in completely or partially broken - ergodic 3-d billiards , we have @xmath71 with @xmath72 , and the exponent @xmath73 is determined by how the billiard symmetry is broken by the lead orientation .",
    "it should be noted : open 2-d billiards always share @xmath74 [ 4 ] , independently of both integrability and lead orientations .",
    "the magneto - resistance is also a very important problem in 3-d billiards .",
    "it is well known that in ballistic 2-d billiards the decrease of resistance with increasing magnetic field (: negative magneto - resistance ) occurs due to the weak localization based on the quantum interference between a pair of time - reversal symmetric orbits[2 - 5 ] .",
    "what kind of additional novel phenomena will be expected in so(2)-symmetric 3-d billiards with the vertical lead ( @xmath75 ) orientation when a symmetry - breaking weak magnetic field @xmath76 will be applied along the @xmath77 axis ?",
    "in contrast to phase - space structures in 2-d systems where each of chaotic zones generated by weak @xmath76 field is mutually separated by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori , those in 3-d systems consist of chaotic zones mutually connected via narrow chaotic channels called the arnold web ( aw ) [ 14 - 16 ] . in this case ,",
    "electrons incoming in an arbitrary direction , which permeate ( chaotic ) zone by zone in an ergodic way through the aw , can show a global diffusion , i.e. , arnold diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "therefore , a @xmath76 field increases the transmission channels and the number of stationary points in the integration in eq.(3 ) , and the resultant integration in eq.(5 ) over @xmath33 and @xmath37 as well as @xmath32 and @xmath36 indicates @xmath70 . in general we shall expect a more general result , @xmath78 with @xmath79 , and the exponent @xmath80 depends on the width of aw .",
    "a crucial point is that a @xmath76 field has increased the exponent in the power - law behavior of the semiclassical conductance in case of the vertical lead orientation .",
    "this anomalous phenomenon is just the negative magneto - resistance beyond the weak localization .",
    "we here keep to employ the terminology of the @xmath81 @xmath82 wherever a @xmath76 field reduces the zero - field resistance .    on the other hand , for the parallel lead ( @xmath83 ) orientation where each electronic trajectory lies almost in the vertical plane",
    ", @xmath56 is retained , irrespective of the absence or presence of @xmath76 field ; we can expect only the @xmath76 field - induced increment of the proportionality constant , which implies a conventional negative magneto - resistance caused by suppression of the weak localization .    before moving to the next section",
    ", we should note : originally , the negative magneto - resistance was evidenced in the numerical analysis of the conductance of 2-d quantum dots [ 4 ] . the accompanying theory , based on the resistance , manipulated backscattering orbits and attributed this phenomenon to the weak localization [ 4 ] .",
    "later works [ 5 ] based on the conductance , which introduced the small - angle - induced diffraction effect together with an idea of interference between a pair of @xmath84 time - reversal symmetric orbits [ 5 ] , swept away a cloud ( i.e. , breakdown of unitarity ) hanging over the above theory .",
    "all our results in the present section have been obtained just within the same primitive analysis of the conductance as the original one for 2-d dots .",
    "to numerically verify the above prediction , we shall choose a so(2)-symmetric 3-d elliptic shell billiard with the vertical lead orientation .",
    "this ellipsoid is a typical example of completely integrable so(2)-symmetric 3-d billards .",
    "the system in the presence of a symmetry - breaking field @xmath76 parallel to @xmath77 axis will be examined . to understand the classical dynamics of electrons , we analyze as a poincar surface of section the @xmath85 plane with longitude @xmath86 and velocity component @xmath87 as birkhoff coordinates [ 17 ] .",
    "( @xmath88 is the velocity unit corresponding to the lowest mode . ) for @xmath89 , the trajectory from the entrance @xmath63 with an arbitrary initial velocity vector lying out of @xmath90 plane proves to be confined to a torus ( see fig.2(a ) ) , failing to reach the exit @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) be the ratio between the cyclotron radius @xmath94 and the characteristic length @xmath95 of the cross - sectional ellipse ( see the caption of fig.1 ) .",
    "then @xmath76 field can be expressed as @xmath96 with @xmath97 ( @xmath98 corresponds to @xmath95 ) . in case of a weak field ( @xmath99 ) ,",
    "poincar sections for the    trajectory with the same initial velocity vector as in fig.2(a ) are given in figs.2(b ) and ( c )    for increasing numbers of bouncings at the outer billiard wall , and similarly those for the trajectory with the initial velocity vector lying in the @xmath100 plane are given in figs.2(d)-(f ) .",
    "one can find : as the @xmath76 field is switched on , the orbit trajectory first leaves the initial torus , enters an outer layer , and , repeating a similar process , diffuses over more and more distant layers , exhibiting a phenomenon of the arnold diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "even though a symmetry - breaking field is weak enough to keep the orbit almost straight , ad makes it possible for the trajectories with initial angular momenta @xmath101 to reach the exit @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath91 ( see figs.2(c ) and ( f ) ) and eventually to contribute to conductance .    to proceed to the numerical calculation of semiclassical transmission amplitudes in eqs.(3,4 ) for the 3-d elliptic billiard with the vertical lead orientation ,",
    "let us define the @xmath102 monodromy matrix @xmath103 as @xmath104 .",
    "at the entrance we introduce a pair of mutually orthogonal coordinates @xmath105 and @xmath106 lying in the transverse plane perpendicular to the initial direction of each orbit .",
    "similarly @xmath107 and @xmath108 are chosen at the exit . using elements ( @xmath109 ) of @xmath103 matrix , we rewrite the necessary factors for the numerical computation .",
    "for example , @xmath110/({{m } } _ { 11}{{m}}_{22}-{{m}}_{12}{{m}}_{21})$ ] and @xmath111 .",
    "while @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( maslov index ) can be computed by the method suggested in refs.[9,18 ] , the first and last rotation angles in @xmath103 should be determined by using @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 chosen as above , since , after folding the orbit , the initial and final coordinates should become identical . combining all these factors with eqs.(3,4 ) , the semiclassical conductance is calculated explicitly .",
    "the result , which includes both the classical contribution and the quantum correction in an inseparable way , is plotted in fig.3 . although the data show small fluctuations , the fitted curves for their means are described by @xmath56 and @xmath66 in cases of @xmath99 and @xmath89 , respectively , confirming the analytic issue suggested in the previous section .",
    "the increase of the exponent in the @xmath67 dependence of @xmath114 upon switching on a weak field , which can not be seen in 2-d cases , provides a numerical evidence that the negative magneto - resistance (: a difference between two lines in fig.3 ) in 3-d systems comes from ad as well as the weak - localization correction .",
    "we have investigated semiclassical quantum transport in three - dimensional ( 3-d ) ballistic quantum billiards , and explored novel phenomena that can not be seen in 2-d billiards . for partially or completely broken - ergodic 3-d billiards such as so(2 ) symmetric billiards , the dependence of the conductance @xmath114 on the fermi wavenumber @xmath67 is dramatically changed by the lead orientation . in case of the vertical orientation , a symmetry - breaking weak magnetic field turns out to increase the exponent in @xmath67 dependence of @xmath114 . in marked contrast to the 2-d case , the anomalous increase of the conductance should be caused by the arnold diffusion ( ad ) as well as a weak localization correction .",
    "we should note the following:(i)in an extremely weak field case when the width of arnold web ( aw ) is thin enough , we shall see @xmath78 with @xmath115 .",
    "our numerical calculation in the previous section suggests that , to have @xmath116 in a very large @xmath67 regime , @xmath117 should be no less than @xmath118 ; ( ii ) role of a stopper is also essential .",
    "reflection at an inner convex wall should increase the instability of orbits , which is favourable for a genesis of ad ; ( iii ) to clearly observe ad , the symmetry - breaking field should destroy all constants of motion except for the energy . from this viewpoint ,",
    "it is more advantageous to choose a so(2)-symmetric 3-d chaotic shell billiard generated from a fully - chaotic 2-d billiard with a hollow by its rotation around the @xmath58 axis .",
    "the billiards of this kind , which are partially broken - ergodic , are experimentally more accessible than a ( completely broken - ergodic ) elliptic shell billiard , and all conclusions for the latter should hold for the former as well .    finally , we point out the role of temperature in observing the effect of ad on the conductance . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the conductance is related to the scattering matrix as @xmath119\\sum_{\\bf n , m}|t_{\\bf n , m}|^2 $ ] with @xmath120 the fermi distribution function .",
    "then the integration over energy will give a temperature factor @xmath121 with @xmath122 the length of trajectories .",
    "for the vertical lead orientation , this factor suppresses very long trajectories reaching the outgoing lead along the arnold web , and thereby the negative magneto - resistance is described only by the weak - localization correction . on the other hand , if the temperature is lowered , the self - averaging over @xmath67 is not permissible , leading to a suppression of the weak - localization correction .",
    "then the increment of the magneto - resistance is mainly caused by the effect corresponding to the arnold diffusion .",
    "we hope that a future experiment on 3-d ballistic cavities can verify our prediction .",
