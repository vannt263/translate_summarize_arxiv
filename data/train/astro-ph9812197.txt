    "the development of methods for estimating distances to galaxies independently of their redshifts enables direct , quantitative study of _ large - scale dynamics _ ( reviews : dekel 1994 ; strauss & willick 1995 ; willick 1998 ; dekel 1998a ) .",
    "the inferred peculiar velocities of thousands of galaxies are interpreted as noisy tracers of an underlying peculiar velocity field . under the assumption of structure evolution via gravitational instability ( gi ) , one can recover the velocity - potential field and the associated fields of three - dimensional velocity and mass - density fluctuations .",
    "these dynamical fields have important theoretical implications .",
    "for example , they are related directly to the initial fluctuations on scales ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , independent of galaxy - density  biasing \" , and they provide unique constraints on the value of the cosmological density parameter , @xmath14 . combined with galaxy redshift surveys , the dynamical fields can be used to address the  biasing \" relation between galaxies and mass and help us better understand galaxy formation . when compared to the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , they allow a unique test of gi as the source for fluctuation growth , and they provide constraints on the fluctuation power spectrum on intermediate scales .",
    "there is growing evidence in support of the hypothesis that the inferred large - scale peculiar velocity field is real , and of gravitational origin .",
    "first , the @xmath15 temperature fluctuations detected in the cmb are consistent with gravity s generating @xmath16-@xmath17 flows across regions of size @xmath18 , as inferred from the observed peculiar velocities ( , bertschinger , gorski & dekel 1990 ) .",
    "second , the velocity fields inferred independently from spiral and from elliptical galaxies , using different distance indicators , are consistent with being noisy versions of the same underlying velocity field ( kolatt & dekel 1994 ; re - confirmed for the mark iii data , unpublished ; scodeggio 1997 ) .",
    "third , the gross features of the galaxy density field from redshift surveys are similar , within the errors , to the features of the mass - density field derived under gi from the observed peculiar velocities ( dekel 1993 ; hudson 1995 ; sigad 1998 ) , ruling out in particular certain alternative models in which the galaxy distribution could violate the continuity equation ( babul 1994 )",
    ".    the important implications of the dynamical fields , and the encouraging evidence for their reality and gravitational origin , motivate an effort of analysis within the framework of gi .",
    "this is the aim of the  program and related investigations .",
    "bertschinger and dekel ( 1989 , bd ) proposed the original idea to recover the three - dimensional velocity field using the expected irrotationality of gravitational flows in the weakly non - linear regime , and demonstrated the feasibility of such a method .",
    "a first version of the method was developed and tested by dekel , bertschinger & faber ( 1990 , dbf ) , and first maps of the recovered fields in our near cosmological neighborhood were presented , based on the mark ii data that were available at that time ( bertschinger , dekel , faber , dressler & burstein 1990 , bdfdb ) .",
    "the present paper is the main paper of the second - generation  analysis , describing and evaluating in detail the improved method and presenting maps and simple statistics based on the extended mark iii data ( willick 1997a ) .",
    "the aim of the potent analysis is to recover with minimal systematic errors the velocity and density fields that would be obtained if the true three - dimensional velocity field were sampled uniformly and with infinite density , and smoothed with a spherical gaussian window of a fixed radius ( hereafter g@xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the smoothing radius in @xmath20 , , g10 , g12 , etc . ) . the spatial statistical uniformity implied by the fixed smoothing scale , which is a special feature of potent , is useful both for pure cosmographic purposes and for simple , direct comparisons of the recovered fields with theoretical models and other observations .",
    "note that , for certain specific purposes , such as a velocity - velocity comparison with a redshift survey for determining the parameter @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the relevant biasing parameter ) , one also has the option of applying _ variable _ smoothing that can be optimized to match the non - uniform sampling and errors in the data .",
    "this is true in potent as well as in other methods ( , dbf ; bdfdb ; davis , nusser & willick 1996 , itf ; willick 1997b , velmod ) .",
    "for example , a reconstruction method using a wiener filter for a rigorous treatment of the random errors ( zaroubi , hoffman & dekel 1998 ) naturally applies such a variable smoothing that is determined by the data , noise and a prior power spectrum .",
    "the wiener fields are then forced to a fixed smoothing by generating constrained realizations .",
    "a few more introductory words about the key idea of potent are in order for the reader who is not familiar with dbf .",
    "if the large - scale structure evolved according to gi , the large - scale peculiar velocity field is expected to be _ irrotational _ , @xmath24 .",
    "any vorticity mode would have decayed away during the linear phase of fluctuation growth as the universe expanded , and , based on kelvin s circulation theorem , the flow remains vorticity - free in the weakly non - linear regime as long as it is laminar , , with no orbit crossing ( dbf ) .",
    "this has been shown to be a good approximation when collapsed regions are properly smoothed over , on scales of a few mpc or more ( db ; dbf ) .",
    "irrotationality implies that the velocity field can be derived from a scalar potential , @xmath25 , and thus the radial velocity field @xmath26 , which also consists of one number at each point in space , should contain enough information for a full reconstruction . in the standard  procedure ,",
    "the velocity potential is computed by integration along radial rays from the observer , ( ) = -_0^r u ( r , , ) dr  .",
    "[ eq : pot ] the two missing transverse velocity components along @xmath27 and @xmath28 are then recovered by differentiation , and the underlying mass - density fluctuation field is computed from the partial derivatives of the velocity field using a mildly non - linear approximation ( see ) .",
    "the potent procedure thus recovers the underlying mass - density fluctuation field from a whole - sky sample of observed radial peculiar velocities via the following steps :    ( ) .1 cm -0pt    prepare the radial velocities for potent analysis , in particular correcting for malmquist bias in different ways , including grouping .",
    "smooth the peculiar velocities into a uniformly - smoothed radial velocity field that has minimum bias .",
    "apply the ansatz of gravitating potential flow to recover the potential and three - dimensional velocity field .",
    "derive the underlying mass density field by an approximation to gi in the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "evaluate the remaining systematic and random errors using mock catalogs .",
    "the most challenging part of the potent procedure is the second step in the above list , where one tries to obtain an unbiased radial - velocity field @xmath26 from the observed noisy and sparsely sampled radial velocities of galaxies ( ) .",
    "the present analysis is superior to the original potent analysis of 1990 in several ways :    ( ) .1 cm -0pt    the new mark iii catalog contains @xmath29 galaxies , mostly spirals with @xmath30 distance errors , compared with only @xmath31 galaxies in mark ii , which were dominated by ellipticals with 21% errors .",
    "the mark iii catalog samples with higher resolution an extended volume of typical radius @xmath32 about the local group ( lg ) .",
    "this catalog , assembled from several different datasets , is carefully calibrated and merged into a self - consistent sample ( ) .",
    "new efforts have been made to minimize systematic errors in the data , such as malmquist bias ( ) .",
    "the derivation of the smoothed radial velocity field from the discrete peculiar velocities is better designed and tested to minimize systematic errors due to the tensor window imposed by the radial velocities and due to the sparse and non - uniform sampling ( ) .",
    "the potential analysis is done with higher resolution and improved accuracy such that the computational errors become negligible compared to the other uncertainties ( ) .    the density field , which in dbf involved an elaborate iterative procedure in lagrangian space , is now recovered from the velocity field using a straightforward eulerian prescription ( ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in we briefly describe the mark iii data . in the following six sections we describe the potent method and its testing step by step using mock catalogs . in",
    "we describe the mock catalogs that serve as our major tool for evaluating errors . in",
    "we define the statistics to be used in the evaluation of the reconstruction . in",
    "we elaborate on the potential analysis and the derivation of the density field . in",
    "we discuss in detail the smoothing procedure and the minimization of the associated systematic errors . in",
    "we describe three different schemes for correcting malmquist bias . in",
    "we define our reference volumes and evaluate the remaining errors in the potent analysis within these volumes .",
    "the next two sections describe the results of applying potent to the actual mark iii catalog : in we present maps of velocity and mass - density fields and in we compute the bulk velocity in spheres and shells about the local group and show preliminary results concerning a decomposition of the velocity field into its divergent and tidal components .    finally , in , we discuss issues concerning the method and the data , summarize the cosmological implications and comment on alternative methods and other results .",
    "we conclude with a summary in .",
    "the mark iii catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities ( willick 1995 ; 1996 ; 1997a ) consists of roughly 3300 galaxies from several different datasets of spiral and elliptical / s0 galaxies .",
    "the distances were inferred by the tully - fisher ( tf ) and @xmath33 distance indicators , respectively . these are based on empirical intrinsic linear correlations between a distance independent quantity ( the log of the internal velocity in a galaxy , @xmath34 , referring to rotation in spirals and dispersion in ellipticals ) and a distance - dependent quantity ( the apparent magnitude in spirals and the log of the apparent diameter in ellipticals ) .",
    "forward \" tf relation between the intrinsic quantities @xmath34 and absolute magnitude @xmath35 is m_tf ( ) = a - b  . [ eq : ftf ] it yields an inferred distance @xmath36 from observed values of @xmath34 and apparent magnitude @xmath37 via the standard distance - modulus relation 5 d = m - m_tf ( )  .",
    "the cmb redshift @xmath38 of the galaxy is obtained from the helio - centric redshift using the standard transformation based on cobe s 4-year dipole ( lineweaver 1996 ) , and the inferred radial peculiar velocity at @xmath36 , in the cmb frame , is u = z - d  , where all quantities are measured in @xmath39 , , the speed of light @xmath40 and the hubble constant @xmath41 are set to unity .",
    "[ we measure distances equivalently by @xmath42 or by @xmath20 , where @xmath43 . ]",
    "the slope of the tf relation , @xmath23 , can be derived from cluster galaxies that are assumed to be at a common distance within each cluster .",
    "the tf zero point , @xmath44 , which fixes the absolute distance scale ( in @xmath45 , or @xmath46 , still independent of the actual value of the hubble constant ) , is free to be determined by minimizing residuals about a hubble flow in a volume as large as possible .",
    "the scatter about the mean tf relation is between @xmath47 and @xmath48 magnitudes , which translates to a random uncertainty of @xmath49-@xmath50 in the inferred distance .",
    "the large - scale backbone of the mark ii data was the whole - sky set of @xmath51 ellipticals and s0 s dominated by lynden - bell ( 1988 , known as the ",
    "7-samurai \" or  7s \" survey ) , supplemented by data from dressler & faber ( 1991 ) and lucey & carter ( 1988 ) . the more local neighborhood , out to @xmath52 , was dominated by a set of spirals , mostly from aaronson ( 1982 ; a82 ) . in the mark",
    "iii catalog we have added the large southern sample of spirals by mathewson , ford & buchhorn ( 1992 ; mat ) , the northern sample by courteau & faber ( courteau 1996 , 1997 ; cf ) , the narrow - angle sample towards perseus - pisces by willick ( 1991 ; w91pp ) , and the whole - sky cluster sample by han , mould and collaborators ( han & mould 1990 , 1992 ; mould 1991 ; hmcl ) .",
    "we also revised the a82 data set based on the uniform diameters and related revisions by tormen & burstein ( 1995 ) .",
    "the full catalog consists of @xmath53 spirals .",
    "table 1 summarizes the main properties and selection criteria of the datasets that make up the mark iii catalog .",
    "the number of galaxies actually used from each dataset in the potent application of the present paper is typically smaller than the number in the final published version of the mark iii catalog because of removal of duplicate galaxies that are common to different datasets ( see below ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a few galaxies that were removed from the final published version based on large tf residuals are still present in the version of the data used here .",
    "the effects of these slight differences in the data are not noticeable in the outcome .    assuming that all galaxies trace the same underlying velocity field , the analysis of large - scale motions greatly benefits from merging the different samples into one , self - consistent catalog . in the mark",
    "iii catalog , the tf relations for each dataset were re - calibrated and merged into a homogeneous catalog for velocity analysis .",
    "the treatment of the cluster datasets is described in willick ( 1995 ) , the field galaxies are calibrated and grouped in willick ( 1996 ) , and the final catalog is tabulated in willick ( 1997a ) .    generating the mark",
    "iii catalog involved the following steps :    ( ) .1 cm -0pt    standardizing the selection criteria , , rejecting galaxies of extreme inclination or low velocity parameter @xmath34 , which exhibit large tf errors , and sharpening any redshift cutoff for the purpose of bias corrections .",
    "re - deriving a provisional tf calibration for each dataset using willick s algorithm ( 1994 ) , which simultaneously groups , fits and corrects for selection bias ( see ) , then verifying that inverse - tf distances to all clusters are consistent with the forward - tf distances .    starting with one dataset ( hmcl ) , adding each new set in succession using galaxies in common to adjust the tf zero points of the new set if necessary .    retaining only one measurement per galaxy rather than averaging multiple measurements to ensure well defined errors ( but at the cost of losing some 10% of the spiral data ) and using multiple observations for a `` cluster '' only if the membership duplication within that cluster is small ( , @xmath54 ) .    including the ellipticals from mark ii , allowing for a slight zero - point shift of 3% ( based on a revised analysis of kolatt & dekel 1994 ) .",
    "such an extensive calibration and merger procedure is _ crucial _ for reliable results  in several cases it produced tf distances substantially different from those quoted by the original observers .    -0.5truecm    = 6.0 in    -0.5truecm",
    "the main purpose of grouping in the mark iii catalog is to reduce the random error per object , and thus automatically reduce the resulting malmquist bias (   [ sec : mb ] below ) .",
    "the grouping procedure is described in detail in willick ( 1996 ) .",
    "galaxies were assigned to groups according to their proximity in angular position and in redshift .",
    "proximity in inferred distance was used as a secondary criterion .",
    "the final grouped mark iii catalog consists of @xmath55  objects \"  single galaxies , groups and clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : m3 ] illustrates the spatial distribution of objects in the mark iii catalog and their radial peculiar velocities in three orthogonal slices .",
    "one notices the poor coverage of the galactic zone of avoidance ( zoa , about @xmath56 ) and at large distances .",
    "the supergalactic plane ( @xmath57 ) and the plane @xmath58 both cut through the great attractor ( ga , @xmath59 ) and perseus pisces ( pp , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) regions where the streaming motions are large compared to the perpendicular plane , @xmath62 .    despite the careful effort made in the construction of the mark iii data , some galaxies are left that could be regarded as outliers , either because of observational errors or because they are indeed eccentric galaxies not obeying the tf relation .",
    "we make an additional effort to exclude such outliers using an iterative procedure based on the deviation of the inferred object peculiar velocity from the smoothed underlying velocity field at the location of that object . in each iteration ,",
    "the data go through the smoothing procedure , and an object at @xmath63 is rejected if its peculiar velocity @xmath64 deviates from the smoothed velocity @xmath65 by more than @xmath66 , where the first term refers to the random distance error of the object and the second is an estimate of the dispersion velocity of field galaxies . in the end , only 3 galaxies are rejected from the mark iii data by applying this criterion .    in a recent analysis ( willick & strauss 1998 , velmod2 , hereafter vm2 ) ,",
    "a revised calibration has been proposed for the tf zero points in the mark iii datasets that cover the perseus - pisces region , based on maximizing the agreement with the peculiar velocities predicted by the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey .",
    "we test below the effects of this revised calibration on the reconstructed fields ( ) .",
    "the potent method is tested using artificial catalogs based on an @xmath67-body simulation , which are described in detail in kolatt ( 1996 ) .",
    "we present here only a brief summary .",
    "a special effort has been made to generate a simulation that mimics the actual large - scale structure in the real universe about the local group , in order to take into account possible dependencies of the errors on the underlying signal .",
    "the present - day density field , smoothed with a gaussian of radius @xmath68 ( g5 ) , is taken to be the g5 density of iras 1.2 jy galaxies as reconstructed by the method described in sigad ( 1998 ) , assuming @xmath69 and no biasing ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the field is evolved back in time to remove non - linear effects by integrating the zeldovich - bernoulli equation of nusser & dekel ( 1992 ) .",
    "remaining non - gaussian features are removed by rank - preserving  gaussianization \" ( weinberg 1991 ) , and artificial structure on scales smaller than the smoothing length is added using the method of constrained realizations ( hoffman & ribak 1991 ) , with the power spectrum of the iras 1.2 jy survey ( fisher 1993 ) as a prior model . the resulting density field is fed as initial conditions to a pm @xmath67-body code ( bertschinger & gelb 1991 ) , which then follows the forward non - linear evolution under gravity with @xmath69 .",
    "the present epoch is defined by an rms density fluctuation of @xmath71 at a top - hat smoothing of radius @xmath72 , consistent with the value observed for iras galaxies and @xmath70 ( fisher 1994 ) .",
    "the periodic box of side @xmath73 is simulated with a @xmath74 force grid and @xmath74 particles .    displays the particles in a slice of the simulation , of thickness @xmath75 about the supergalactic plane .",

    "this procedure amounts to a random selection of galaxies ( as well as their physical properties ) that mimics the statistical properties of the observed sample .",

    "a meaningful measure that allows a comparative evaluation of reconstructions with different smoothings is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the standard deviation of the true field .",

    "the slope of the regression line , @xmath101 , characterizes the _ global _ bias ; a deviation of @xmath102 from unity can be interpreted as an error in the effective smoothing of the reconstruction .",
    "note that such a global systematic error could be harmful when the potent output is used for measuring cosmological parameters or is compared to other data , and it should therefore be kept small .",
    "one can crudely correct for such a bias in retrospect , provided it is sufficiently small ( , dekel 1993 ) .",

    "equivalently , the same local bias can be characterized by the linear correlation coefficient , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the standard deviation of the average potent field . the simple relation between these two equivalent measures of local bias is ^2 = r^-2 -1  .",
    "the whole systematic error is then characterized by the sum in quadrature of the local and global components : ^2 = s^2(r^-2 - 1 ) + ( s-1)^2 + c^2 ^2 ( assuming @xmath107 ) . in each case , we list the parameters @xmath102 , @xmath108 and @xmath40 , plus the corresponding @xmath98 , as measures of systematic errors inside a reference volume .",

    "are all unweighted ; the grid points within the reference volume are treated as equals .",
    "however , further analysis using potent output may prefer to give more weight to points in which the reconstruction is of higher quality .",
    "for example , in the potiras comparison ( sigad 1998 ) , the potent densities were weighted by @xmath114 , including the random _ and _ the systematic errors . in the tests presented here ,",
    "however , we prefer to use @xmath115 as weights and as flags of quality reconstruction .",
    "this is because @xmath116 does not explicitly depend on the true field , and because the weighting by @xmath114 would artificially reduce the signal of systematic errors which we wish to identify .",
    "we thus define weighted statistics , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , etc .",
    ", in a way analogous to the above statistics @xmath102 , @xmath108 , etc . , except that the volume averaging is replaced by _ weighted _ volume averaging , with weights @xmath115 .",
    "this weighting , like all the above statistics , is specific to the given dataset , which is currently the mark iii catalog .",
    "the most straightforward stage of potent is the potential analysis starting from a smoothed radial peculiar velocity field , @xmath26 .",
    "this stage consists of applying the ansatz of potential flow , , to recover the velocity potential and the three - dimensional velocity field , @xmath119 , and then deriving the underlying density fluctuation field @xmath120 by an adequate approximation to gi in the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "we test this part of the method assuming the true smoothed velocity field as input .",
    "-0.5truecm      in practice , the smoothed radial velocity field is computed ( below ) at the points of a spherical grid of 24 equal radial bins out to @xmath121 , 48 equal latitude ( @xmath122 ) bins in the range @xmath123 , and @xmath124 roughly - equal longitude bins between 0 and @xmath125 .",
    "the potential at the origin is arbitrarily fixed to zero , and the potential at every other grid point is computed by cubic spline integration of @xmath26 along the radial rays of the spherical grid , .    the potential is then interpolated by linear cloud - in - cell ( cic ) onto the points of a cubic grid of @xmath126 spacing ( positioned such that there is a grid point at the origin ) .",
    "the partial derivatives are computed by finite differencing to yield the three - dimensional velocity components via @xmath127 .",

    "-0.5truecm      in the linear approximation to gi , the underlying mass - density fluctuation field is derived from the velocity field via one more differentiation , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "however , the linear approximation is limited to the small dynamic range between a few tens of megaparsecs and the @xmath13 extent of the current samples .",
    "the current sampling of galaxies enables reliable dynamical analysis with a smoothing radius as small as @xmath130 ( or even smaller in more limited regions ) , where @xmath131 reaches values larger than unity such that non - linear effects play a role .",
    "therefore , the derivation of the density field requires an approximate solution to the equations of gi in the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "we appeal to the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation , which is known to be a successful tool in the mildly non - linear regime . substituting an eulerian version of the zeldovich approximation in the continuity equation yields ( nusser 1991 ) @xmath132 where the bars denote",

    "we decompose the velocity field into two components : the  divergent \" component arising from the mass fluctuation field within the sphere of radius @xmath201 about the lg , and the  tidal \" component arising from the mass distribution outside this sphere .",
    "the decomposition is performed as follows .",
    "first , the  linear \" density fluctuation field is recovered from the total velocity field using the linear relation , @xmath378 . then , assuming @xmath379 outside the sphere of radius @xmath201 , the divergent component of the velocity is computed by the inverse relation , ( ) = f()4 _ 0( ) -| -|^3",

    "this decomposition is illustrated in .",
    "the divergent component clearly shows the dominant infall patterns into the two attractors , ga and pp , or , equivalently , the outflow from the elongated void between them . there is little bulk flow in this component , only @xmath380 within the sphere of radius @xmath201 .",
    "the tidal component is dominated by a bulk flow , of @xmath381 in the direction @xmath363 . as expected , most of the bulk velocity within @xmath201 is due to the mass distribution outside this volume .",
    "when this bulk velocity is subtracted off , the residual tidal field shows hints of a quadrupole moment aligned with the direction to shapley . a detailed investigation along these lines , using both wiener and potent reconstructions and considering the errors ,",
    "is described by hoffman , eldar , zaroubi & dekel ( 1999 ) .",
    "before concluding this paper , we provide a discussion of issues concerning the remaining errors ( ) , the use of potent results for cosmology ( ) , alternative methods of reconstruction from peculiar velocities ( ) , and related results from other data ( ) .",
    "-0.5truecm      as described in , a possible source of systematic error in the mark iii data is the simultaneous calibration of the tf distance indicators of the different datasets , and in particular the relative zero - pointing , which may be responsible for artificial differential hubble - like peculiar flows in different datasets at different directions , and thus , , for a spurious bulk flow .",
    "we find that the uncertainty , as expressed by the difference between the original calibration of mark iii and the iras - motivated vm2 calibration of the same data , or by the apparent differences with the independent calibration of related data in sfi , is limited in practice to the flow at large distances , especially in the pp direction , and it hardly propagates into the inner regions where the reconstruction of the mass density is reliable and useful for further quantitative analysis .",
    "the ongoing shf survey of tf galaxies in a shell between @xmath355 and @xmath356 will help to determine the relative zero points and hopefully put the remaining uncertainty to rest .",
    "the global zero point remains subject to cosmic scatter .",
    "based on the current wisdom regarding the cosmological model and the fluctuation power spectrum , the zero - point estimate is probably good to an accuracy of about @xmath382 ( in hubble - like peculiar velocity ) . using the recovered potent fields in a certain volume which is our best bet for a",
    " fair sample \" given the mark iii data , we can re - calibrate the zero point in retrospect such that either the mean density fluctuation vanishes or the rms of the peculiar velocities relative to the hubble flow is minimized .",
    "the advantage of using the potent fields for this purpose rather than the raw galaxy radial velocities lies in the statistical spatial uniformity of the potent fields that are sampled at the points of a uniform grid .",
    "we find that , in order to satisfy @xmath383 inside @xmath3 , we need to decrease the tf distances by only 3% ( @xmath384 ) compared to the zero point originally determined for mark iii ( willick 1995 ; 1997a ) .",
    "the determination of the zero point is based on assuming @xmath385 locally ; the true universal value can only be determined by comparing to the hubble flow in a much larger volume .",
    "preliminary hints for a local  hubble bubble \" of radius @xmath386 encompassed by the great walls ( defined by redshift surveys ) come from a sample of accurate ( 5 - 8% ) peculiar velocities of supernovae type ia extending to much larger distances ( zehavi 1998 ) .",
    "these data may in fact indicate that the hubble expansion within the volume sampled by mark iii is @xmath387 faster than the global expansion , such that the local mean density in that volume is @xmath84 to @xmath214 lower than the universal mean ( zehavi 1998 ) .",
    "the malmquist bias , which used to be a systematic error of major concern in previous analyses , has been dealt with in three different ways , yielding satisfactory similarity between the results .",
    "the window bias is now well understood and an effort has been made , for the first time , to minimize it properly . the sampling - gradient bias has been understood since dbf and an effort has been made to minimize it .",
    "the current potent procedure provides a simple compromise recipe to handle these biases simultaneously .",
    "reliable estimates of the remaining biases are provided , and they should be used in any following quantitative analysis using the potent fields .",
    "our understanding of these biases should guide future survey selection , with a special emphasis on uniform spatial coverage .",
    "the mock catalogs used for testing the method and evaluating the errors were based on a simulation of @xmath69 and @xmath71 with a resolution of @xmath388 .",
    "if @xmath389 is higher or @xmath14 is lower , then the errors are expected to be larger and the reconstruction more difficult .",
    "such cases should be tested with appropriate simulations .",
    "new constrained - realization simulations of much higher resolution and a variety of values of @xmath14 are in progress ( lemson @xmath390 , in progress ) .",
    "they will allow us to better test the potent procedure under more difficult conditions .    with the systematic errors reasonably under control ,",
    "the main source of remaining uncertainty is due to the random errors , which mostly arise from the intrinsic scatter in the distance indicator , accompanied by sparse sampling and measurement errors .",
    "this uncertainty can be reduced by denser sampling and especially by using more accurate distance indicators ( see willick 1998 for a review ) .    several new tf/  surveys are in progress .",
    "the shf survey will obtain uniform tf data for an added full - sky sample of 300 field spirals with @xmath391 and will thus make possible a definitive calibration of existing tf data .",
    "several deeper , full - sky surveys are focusing on cluster galaxies at redshifts @xmath392 ( giovanelli 1997a , b , sci ; hudson 1998 , smac ; willick 1998 , lp10k ) and hold the promise of constraining bulk flows on very large ( @xmath393 ) scales . a survey of ellipticals at similar distances in two large patches of the sky ( wegner 1996 , efar ) ,",
    "will soon be complemented by a whole - sky survey that will replace the original ",
    "7-samurai \" survey with denser sampling ( da costa 1999 , enear ) .",
    "most promising in the long run are distances to supernovae type ia , with estimated errors of only @xmath394 and potential coverage of a very large volume ( hamuy  1995 ; riess , press & kirshner 1995a , b ; perlmutter  1997 ) .",
    "the density of sampling , down to the mean separation of galaxies , is limited only by the effort put into long - term supernovae searches and the time needed to accumulate a large sample .",
    "preliminary attempts for a low - resolution potent analysis out to @xmath18 are already in progress .    on small scales , the sampling of mark iii galaxies nearby",
    "is dense enough for a potent reconstruction with a resolution higher than g12 , which can resolve better the local supercluster ( in preparation ) .",
    "the distances to early type galaxies based on surface - brightness fluctuations ( tonry 1997 ) , with their higher accuracy , can be of significant contribution here .",
    "-0.5truecm      extracting cosmological information from the peculiar velocity data is possible in several different ways , some of which do not involve potent reconstruction at all .",
    "however , the statistical spatial uniformity of the potent fields offers certain unique opportunities to constrain the cosmological parameters and the initial fluctuations .",
    "the main applications involve ( a ) measuring @xmath14 directly from potent data alone , ( b ) obtaining cosmological constraints from a combination of potent data and cmb fluctuations , and ( c ) comparing potent fields to redshift surveys for measuring @xmath14 via the parameter @xmath21 , which is contaminated by galaxy biasing .",
    "these methods were reviewed , for example , in dekel ( 1994 ; 1998 ) , dekel , burstein & white ( 1997 ) , and in numerous conference proceedings .",
    "following is a brief summary .",
    "the potent fields enable direct constraints on @xmath14 subject only to the assumptions of gaussian initial fluctuations and gi growth of fluctuations ; they are independent of the complex issue of galaxy density biasing .",
    "methods to obtain such constraints have been developed and have already been applied to preliminary versions of the potent mark iii fields .",
    "for example , the divergence of the flow in underdense regions in our local cosmological vicinity , and in particular in the sculptor void at @xmath6 from the lg roughly towards the south galactic pole , provides a straightforward lower bound of @xmath395 at the @xmath396 level of confidence ( dekel & rees 1994 ) .",
    "the analogous constraint by potent from the sfi data in a preliminary analysis seems to be even stronger ( eldar 1999 ) . as another example , the deviation of the present - day probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath397 from a gaussian distribution , and in particular the skewness of this distribution , both measurable from the potent output , provide a similar lower bound on @xmath14 ( bernardeau 1995 ) .",
    "finally , the deviation from a gaussian distribution of the recovered initial pdf of density fluctuations , derived by following the fluctuations back in time to the linear regime , enables a similar constraint with even higher statistical significance ( nusser & dekel 1993 ) .",
    "these and related methods are being currently applied to the new potent fields from the latest mark iii and sfi datasets .    to compare to the cmb , the potent potential field was translated to hypothetical maps of temperature fluctuations in the last - scattering surface of the microwave background . the earliest version of these maps , by bertschinger , gorski & dekel ( 1990 ) based on the mark ii data ,",
    "was used to predict cmb fluctuations at the level of @xmath15 under the assumption that the local cosmological neighborhood sampled by peculiar velocities is roughly a  fair sample \" of the universe .",
    "this prediction was made before the dmr instrument on board the cobe satellite and balloon - borne experiments actually detected these fluctuations .",
    "a more recent reconstruction along similar lines , by zaroubi ( 1997a ) from the mark iii data , treats more accurately the physical sources of temperature fluctuations and deals with different cosmological models .",
    "the most robust conclusion from the comparison of the potent results and the observed fluctuations in the cmb is their mutual consistency with the growth rate predicted by gi .",
    "the potent density field has also been used to determine the power spectrum of mass - density fluctuations ( kolatt & dekel 1997 ) .",
    "it is characterized by an amplitude of @xmath398 at @xmath399 , and a high value of rms fluctuations in a top - hat window of radius @xmath72 , @xmath400 .",
    "the observed mass power spectrum from velocities is then compared to the linear predictions of a family of inflation - motivated flat cdm models ( @xmath401 ) that are normalized by the cobe dmr measurements of cmb temperature fluctuations on large angular scales . assuming no tensor fluctuations , the result is approximated by @xmath402 , where @xmath403 and @xmath158 is the logarithmic slope of the power spectrum on large scales .",
    "these results were confirmed and elaborated on by a potent - independent likelihood analysis of the mark iii velocities ( zaroubi 1997b ) and the sfi velocities ( freudling 1998 ) .",
    "the implication is that slight modifications of the standard cdm model are needed for a good fit with these data : either an @xmath14 value somewhat smaller than unity or a moderate tilt in the power spectrum on large scales ( limited though to @xmath404 in order to ensure a noticeable acoustic peak in the cmb angular power spectrum at @xmath405 , zaroubi 1997a ) .",
    "an alternative solution is provided by mixing @xmath351 massive neutrinos with the dominant cold dark matter .",
    "much of the use of peculiar velocity data so far has been in comparing to the galaxy density field extracted from whole - sky redshift surveys , or to the peculiar velocities predicted from these redshift data using linear gi .",
    "such comparisons can provide degenerate constraints on @xmath14 and on the biasing relation between the density fluctuations of galaxies and mass .",
    "when this biasing relation is parameterized by a linear proportionality factor , @xmath23 , the comparison leads to an estimate of the degenerate parameter @xmath406 ( reviews : dekel 1994 ; strauss & willick 1995 ; strauss 1998 ; dekel 1998a ) .",
    "the latest comparison of the _ density _ fields of potent mark iii and the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey within @xmath3 yields @xmath407 ( sigad 1998 ) .",
    "this is somewhat lower than earlier estimates from mark ii velocities and iras 1.9 jy redshifts ( dekel 1993 ) but is consistent with the result @xmath408 from the more - clustered optical galaxies ( hudson 1995 ) .",
    "other methods of comparison of mark iii peculiar velocities and the _ velocities _ predicted from iras 1.2 jy galaxies have led in general to somewhat lower estimates of the relevant @xmath21 parameters , near @xmath409 ( , itf ; velmod ; vm2 ) .",
    "the span of @xmath21 estimates in the range @xmath410 may partly arise from underestimated systematic errors and cosmic scatter between different volumes of sampling , it may partly reflect differences between comparisons of velocities versus comparisons of density fields , and it may partly be due to nontrivial features in the galaxy biasing scheme , including non - linearity , scale - dependence and stochasticity ( , dekel & lahav 1998 ; dekel 1998b ; somerville 1998 ) . an important goal for future research is to better understand the sources of the observed span of values for @xmath21 .",
    "this can be achieved in the near future by a combination of observational and theoretical means .",
    "-0.5truecm      as mentioned already , the main source of uncertainty in the potent reconstruction arises from the random distance errors . still within the family of methods based on inferred distances ,",
    "the noise can be better dealt with by implementing an alternative algorithm based on the wiener filter ( wf ) plus constrained realizations ( cr ) ( zaroubi , hoffman & dekel 1998 ) .",
    "the derived wiener field is the most probable mean field given the noisy data and a prior model for the power spectrum , but , like most other methods except potent , it suffers from a non - uniform effective smoothing which follows the spatial variations in the errors .",
    "the constrained realizations , based on an assumed power spectrum that could be derived in a preceding stage from the same data , are of spatially uniform variance .",
    "each of them could therefore equally well be an approximation to the real structure in our cosmological neighborhood .",
    "a working algorithm has been developed so far only in the linear regime of gravitational instability theory .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the wiener mass - density field obtained from the sfi data is fairly similar to the one obtained from the mark iii data ( zaroubi 1999 ) .",
    "this method is complementary to potent in many respects . in the nearby regions where the signal dominates over the noise , the wf / cr fields are in general agreement with the potent fields , but the wf / cr method allows an interesting extrapolation into large distances where the noise dominates .",
    "if the selection of the tf data does not explicitly depend on the internal velocity @xmath34 , the malmquist bias can be eliminated altogether by minimizing @xmath34 residuals in redshift space without ever inferring actual distances to individual galaxies ( schechter 1980 ) .",
    "the distance is replaced by @xmath411 , where @xmath412 is a parametric model for the radial peculiar velocity field , , an expansion in spherical harmonics and radial bessel functions ( davis , nusser , & willick 1996 ) or a fourier expansion ( blumenthal , dekel & yahil 1999 , mfpot ) .",
    "several methods use the data from a whole - sky redshift survey such as iras 1.2 jy as an intrinsic part of the reconstruction from peculiar velocities .",
    "these methods are typically geared to estimating goodness of fit and certain parameters of the model ( , @xmath21 ) without ever reconstructing statistically uniform maps of density or velocity fields .",
    "the use of the itf method so far is basically of this nature ; the recovered model velocity field has been compared mode by mode to a similar expansion of the iras 1.2 jy predicted velocity field with the aim of determining @xmath21 .",
    "the alternative velmod method ( willick 1997b ) compares the raw peculiar velocity data with a high - resolution ",
    "model \" velocity field that is predicted from the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey under the assumption of linear biasing .",
    "a key feature of velmod is that it explicitly allows for a non - unique mapping between real space and redshift space .",
    "triple - valued zones in the redshift field as well as non - negligible small - scale velocity  temperature \" are treated in a unified way .",
    "this method has been used to determine @xmath21 as well as the tf parameters and other parameters characterizing the velocity field and the errors .",
    "the @xmath413 values obtained from these high - resolution velocity - velocity comparisons are typically in the range 0.5 to 0.6 , with typical errors of @xmath414 ( compared with the potent - iras density - density result of @xmath415 at g12 smoothing ) .    the dynamical fields , the tf parameters _ and _ the cosmological parameter @xmath21 can be recovered _ simultaneously _ by a fit of a parametric model of the potential field to the combined data of the observed radial peculiar velocities and the distribution of galaxies in redshift space ( nusser & dekel 1999 , simpot ) .",
    "this procedure takes advantage of the complementary features of the data in the recovery of the fields , it enforces the same effective smoothing on the data without a preliminary reconstruction procedure such as potent , and it obtains a more reliable best fit by simultaneous rather than successive minimization .",
    "it has been implemented so far to the forward tf data , but it can be generalized in principle to minimize inverse tf residuals .",
    "a natural extension of the potent procedure is to push the recovered mildly non - linear fluctuation fields of the present epoch back in time into the linear regime .",
    "nusser & dekel ( 1992 ) have developed such a  time machine \" by limiting the solution to the growing mode via an eulerian version of the zeldovich approximation ( 1970 ) .",
    "this operation involves solving a simple differential equation for the potential field , termed the zeldovich - bernoulli equation .",
    "it has been applied to an early version of the mark iii catalog . a more accurate solution to this mixed - boundary - condition problem",
    "is provided by following trajectories of particles in time using the least action principle ( shaya 1995 ) .",
    "this was used in combination with redshift data to determine @xmath21 for a local optical redshift survey , obtaining low values .",
    "this original application was limited to a specific biasing scheme in which all the mass is assigned to point - mass galaxies , ignoring the overlap of dark - matter halos and thus overestimating the forces between galaxies .",
    "the current bottom line is that the different estimates of @xmath413 are in the range @xmath410 .",
    "recall that this span of estimates was briefly discussed at the end of the previous subsection .",
    "-0.5truecm      the early application of a simple version of potent ( da costa 1996 ) to the complementary sfi data ( haynes 1999 ; wagner 1999 ) led to an apparent mass distribution in which the gross features roughly agree with the reconstruction from mark iii , but the amplitude of the perturbations is lower and other details also differ .",
    "most of these differences , which were partly due to ignoring the window bias , seem to go away when the improved version of potent is used ; in fact , the density fields out of mark iii and sfi are fairly consistent within the errors ( eldar 1999 ; zaroubi 1999 , using potent and wiener respectively ) . a similar conclusion is obtained via maximum - likelihood determinations of the mass power spectrum ( not involving potent reconstruction ) from the mark iii velocities ( zaroubi 1997b ) and from the sfi velocities ( freudling 1998 ) .",
    "the two power spectra are found to be nearly identical and also very similar to the power spectrum derived from the potent density of mark iii ( kolatt & dekel 1997 ) .",
    "the main remaining difference in the reconstructions from mark iii and sfi is in the flows at large radii .",
    "the sfi bulk velocity in the cmb frame in shells of radii beyond @xmath7 about the lg is small and practically consistent with zero , while in mark iii it remains high , at the level of @xmath416 .",
    "this difference may reflect errors in the differential calibration of the zero points of the tully - fisher relations of the different datasets that constitute these catalogs .",
    "the vm2 calibration of mark iii seems to bring the outer bulk velocity to better agreement with sfi , but this does not necessarily indicate which calibration is more accurate .",
    "the differences occur in the outer regions of the sampled volume where the errors are large and the bias corrections are particularly uncertain , so the apparent discrepancy is not entirely surprising .",
    "a comparison of the basic data for galaxies in common between the sfi and mark iii datasets may prove useful for assessing the source for this discrepancy . it is encouraging though that this difference in the outer bulk flow , independent of its origin , hardly affects the density field , which is only a function of the derivatives of the velocity field .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present the second - generation potent method for reconstructing the underlying dynamical fields of velocity and mass density from observed peculiar velocities .",

    "<S> = -0.5 true cm = -0.5 true cm we present an improved version of the potent method for reconstructing the velocity and mass density fields from radial peculiar velocities , test it with mock catalogs , and apply it to the mark iii catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the method is improved in several ways : ( a ) the inhomogeneous malmquist bias is reduced by grouping and corrected statistically in either forward or inverse analyses of inferred distances , ( b ) the smoothing into a radial velocity field is optimized such that window and sampling biases are reduced , ( c ) the density field is derived from the velocity field using an improved weakly non - linear approximation in eulerian space , and ( d ) the computational errors are made negligible compared to the other errors . the method is carefully tested and optimized using realistic mock catalogs based on an n - body simulation that mimics our cosmological neighborhood , and the remaining systematic and random errors are evaluated quantitatively .    </S>",
    "<S> the mark iii catalog , with @xmath0 grouped galaxies , allows a reliable reconstruction with fixed gaussian smoothing of @xmath1 out to @xmath2 and beyond in some directions . </S>",
    "<S> we present maps of the three - dimensional velocity and mass - density fields and the corresponding errors . </S>",
    "<S> the typical systematic and random errors in the density fluctuations inside @xmath3 are @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the recovered mass distribution resembles in its gross features the galaxy distribution in redshift surveys and the mass distribution in a similar potent analysis of a complementary velocity catalog ( sfi ) , including the great attractor , perseus - pisces , and the large void in between . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction inside @xmath6 is not affected much by a revised calibration of the distance indicators ( vm2 , tailored to match the velocities from the iras 1.2 jy redshift survey ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk velocity within the sphere of radius @xmath7 about the local group is @xmath8 ( including systematic errors ) , and is shown to be mostly generated by external mass fluctuations . with the vm2 calibration , @xmath9 is reduced to @xmath10 .    </S>",
