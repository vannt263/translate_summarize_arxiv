    "first , the phase space can be separated into two regions by an arbitrary small soft cut - off @xmath109 , according to whether the energy ( @xmath110 ) of the emitted gluon is soft , i.e. @xmath111 , or hard , i.e. @xmath112 .",

    "as expected , the @xmath254-factor contributed by the pure qcd corrections is under controlled , of a few tens percent , when the qcd improved bottom quark running mass is used to evaluate the yukawa coupling of the bottom quark . on the other hand",
    ", the susy qcd corrections could become large as @xmath230 decreases , especially for large @xmath221 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "10(1 ) , for @xmath250 , when @xmath255gev , the @xmath254 factor of susy qcd corrections is about 0.8 which dominates the overall k factor . hence , to improve the convergence of the perturbation calculations in the case of large @xmath221 , we could use the susy improved bottom quark running mass to evaluate the yukawa coupling of bottom quark .",
    "more on susy qcd corrections will be discussed below .",

    "3(c ) , is ultraviolet finite but not infrared finite . for @xmath250",
    "the finite part of the pure qcd box diagram contribution becomes more important for large @xmath230 , and its effect is to decreases the total rate . on the contrary , the susy qcd box diagram contribution , arising from fig .",

    "3(d ) , is free of any singularity , and is small numerically .",
    "11 shows the dependence of the k factors on @xmath230 for @xmath15 production , based on the results of case ( iii ) in fig .",
    "namely , the qcd plus susy improved bottom quark running yukawa coupling is used for calculating the total cross section at the lo and the nlo .",
    "generally , the k factor decreases with @xmath230 .",
    "for example , for @xmath250 , when @xmath230 varies from 108gev to 900gev , the k factor corresponding to curve ( a ) ranges from 0.98 to 0.61 , which contains two parts : the pure qcd corrections , shown as curve ( b ) , and susy qcd corrections , shown as curve ( c ) . as compared to the results in fig .",
    "10(1 ) , we find that the susy qcd correction , shown as curve ( c ) , has been largely suppressed .",
    "for instance , the k factor of susy qcd corrections drops from 0.8 , in fig .",
    "10(1 ) , to 0.05 , in fig .  11 , for @xmath255gev , while the other susy parameters are identical in both calculations .",
    "this is because using the susy improved running @xmath249 to evaluate the lo cross section , we have already included the dominant nlo susy qcd corrections .",
    "therefore , we shall use the qcd plus susy improved bottom quark running mass in the following numerical analysis for both the lo and nlo calculations , unless specified otherwise .",
    "it is instructive to examine the results of figs .",
    "10(1 ) and fig .",
    "11 in the heavy mass limit , where all the susy mass parameters except @xmath230 are of the same size and tend to be heavy , i.e. @xmath256 @xmath257 @xmath258 @xmath257 @xmath74 @xmath257 @xmath259 @xmath257 @xmath260 @xmath261 @xmath262 . in the heavy mass limit , the susy qcd box diagram contribution , arising from fig .  3(b ) and",
    "3(d ) , is suppressed by powers of @xmath214 and can be neglected .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical calculation which shows that the susy qcd box contribution is generally below @xmath263 of the total rate .",
    "hence , we shall examine the effect of susy qcd corrections in the heavy mass limit to the virtual diagrams shown in figs .",
    "2(a)(g ) , and compare the analytical result with our numerical calculations .",
    "since our aim is to examine the nlo susy qcd effect in this part of study , we shall use the lo bottom quark yukawa coupling ( with @xmath264gev ) to evaluate the relevant tree level vertices . keeping only terms at @xmath176 that are not suppressed by negative powers of heavy mass @xmath214 in the heavy mass limit , the one loop susy qcd correction to the individual diagram in fig .  2 yields the following corrections .",
    "after stripping off the born level matrix element ( including all the vertex and propagator factors ) , the multiplicative factor of the s - channel diagram with the @xmath4 propagator , cf .",
    "2(a ) , is given by @xmath265 where @xmath84 is the mixing angle of the two cp - even higgs bosons  @xcite .",

    "2(c ) or ( d ) , is given by @xmath267 the multiplicative factor for the sum of figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(g ) is zero .",
    "this is because after adding the wavefunction renormalization factor for the external bottom quark line , the renormalized @xmath268 vertex vanishes in the heavy mass limit .",
    "( again , we have dropped any term that is suppressed by negative powers of the heavy mass scale @xmath214 . ) similarly , the multiplicative factor for the sum of figs .",
    "2(e ) and 2(f ) is zero .    given the above multiplicative factors , we can calculate the susy qcd correction to the total cross section for @xmath243 production at the lhc , and compare it with the complete numerical calculation described in sec .",
    "the results in the heavy mass limit are shown in fig .",
    "12 , which show that the agreement becomes better for larger value of @xmath214 .",
