    "the most successful of these methods is the variational path integral approach developed by feynman in ref .",
    "a polaronic coupling parameter was identified that allows to make a distinction between three regimes : weak coupling , intermediate coupling and strong coupling .",
    "also the internal excitation structure of the polaron was investigated by studying the optical absorption and in the intermediate and strong coupling regime a resonance was found @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this resonance was associated with a transition to a relaxed excited state ( res ) , an excitation in which the induced lattice polarization is ( self - consistently ) adapted to the excited state of the electron .",
    "more recently the polaron optical absorption was studied numerically with diagrammatic quantum monte carlo numerical techniques @xcite . at strong coupling",
    "some differences in the linewidth were found between the spectra derived in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently these differences were better understood through the introduction of the extended memory function formalism ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) but they have not yet been completely clarified . also no material is known that exhibits polaronic strong coupling",
    ". a better understanding of the intermediate and strong coupling regimes is needed , i.a . since polaronic effects may play an important role in unconventional pairing mechanisms occurring in high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we start by recalling the polaronic system consisting of an impurity in a bec and some standard results from the strong coupling approximation .",
    "subsequently , the standard strong coupling approximation is applied to the system consisting of an impurity in a bec . within this approximation",
    "a study is presented of the relaxed excited states and the internal transition frequencies of the bec - impurity polaron .",

    "and it appeared that in this case the polaronic coupling parameter @xmath18 can be defined as follows:@xmath19 as in the case of the solid - state frhlich polaron a transition was found between a weak coupling regime and a strong coupling regime .",
    "furthermore it was noted that the polaronic coupling parameter ( [ couplingpar ] ) can be tuned externally by a magnetic field through a feshbach resonance ( see e.g. @xcite ) . with this technique a coupling parameter @xmath18 of the order of @xmath20",
