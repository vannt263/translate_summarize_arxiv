    "theoretical studies on the existence of solitons in liquid crystals ( @xmath2 ) started in the late sixties and early seventies @xcite-@xcite , and experimental confirmations were reported subsequently @xcite-@xcite . in the case of static solitons in lcs , the molecular configurations may be obtained from the lagrange equations derived from the helmholtz free energy , whereas for propagating solitons the continuous change in these configurations makes it necessary to take into account the damping of the molecular motion . for liquid - crystal waveguides , the nonlinearity necessary for the existence of solitons",
    "is provided by the coupling with the optical field .",
    "coupling of the dynamics of the velocity and director fields in @xmath2 to external optical fields renders the relevant dynamical equations highly nonlinear , which makes it possible to have solitary waves of the director field with or without involving the fluid motion .",
    "furthermore , the strong coupling of the director to light makes any director - wave more easily detectable by optical methods than it is in isotropic fluids , where only the flow field is observable",
    ".    some nonlinear partial differential equations ( @xmath1 ) appearing in the liquid - crystal theory give rise to exact soliton solutions .",
    "these are the korteweg - de vries ( @xmath3 ) , nonlinear schrdinger ( @xmath4 ) , and the sine - gordon ( @xmath5 ) equations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 equation describes a medium with weak nonlinearity and weak dispersion , whereas the @xmath4 equation describes situations where weak nonlinearity and strong dispersion prevail , such as the propagation of signals in liquid - crystal optical fibers .    passing continuous laser beams through nematic lcs reveals the existence of static spatial patterns in cylindrical @xcite and planar @xcite geometries .",
    "the basic physical mechanism which support these time - independent patterns is the balance between the nonlinear refraction ( self - focussing ) and spatial diffraction in the nematic .",
    "however , when the propagation of wavepackets , rather than continuous beams , is considered , a different situation occurs .",
    "the envelope of the wavepacket obeys an @xmath4 equation , which takes into account self - focussing , dispersion and diffraction in the nematic @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this equation has soliton solutions whose speed , time and length scales may be estimated by using experimentally measured values of the corresponding parameters @xcite .",
    "however , the usual analysis of this situation is based on the assumption that the @xmath6 behaves as a kerr medium and that , consequently , strong dispersion and weak nonlinearity , at order @xmath7 , with respect the field amplitude @xmath8 , should be taken into account as it will be discussed below , @xmath8 measures the ratio of the electric - field energy density and the elastic - energy density of the nematic and it is , therefore , a measure of the coupling between the optical field and the fluid .",
    "however , although truncating the analysis at the @xmath7 order may be a very reasonable assumption for solid - state optical media , the soft nature of the lcs suggest that the neglect of higher - order contributions may not necessarily be a good assumption in this case .",
    "recently , the formation of spatial solitary waves in nematic lcs with at the light - power level of a few milliwatts has attracted a good deal of interest @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally shown that the nonlinearity of these media can support solitons in @xmath6 line waveguides @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to develop an approach that allows to generate @xmath1 which describe the propagation of optical pulses in nematic @xmath6 waveguides beyond the weakly nonlinear limit corresponding to the kerr medium .",
    "more specifically , we show that to @xmath9 , and assuming that attenuation effects are small , the evolution of the amplitude of propagating transverse - magnetic transverse - magnetic ( @xmath0 ) modes is governed by an equation  with a derivative nonlinearity , which is the complex modified @xmath3 ( @xmath10 ) equation , @xmath11 see eq .",

    "3 we derive dynamical equations governing the evolution of the amplitude of propagating @xmath0 modes up to the order @xmath9 . rescaling the equations , we show that the standard @xmath4 equation is obtained at order @xmath7 , and that the equation corresponding to @xmath9 is indeed the @xmath10 equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) . in sec . 4 , soliton solutions to this equation are studied . in particular",

    "<S> we show analytically that under certain conditions , the bright solitons are actually double embedded solitons . </S>",

    "<S> we study ( numerically and analytically ) the stability of these solitons . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that these embedded solitons are stable solutions , which is an interesting property since in most systems the embedded solitons are weakly unstable solutions . finally , we close the paper by making comments on the advantages as well as the limitations of our approach , and on further generalizations of the model and method presented .    </S>",
