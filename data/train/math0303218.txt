    "in a series of two papers , the present one and the second one by the second author  @xcite , we continue the study of the hurwitz problem  @xcite concerning counting ramified coverings of the @xmath1-sphere . roughly speaking",
    ", this problem can be formulated as follows :    _ given a set of fixed ramification points on the target @xmath1-sphere and a set of ramification types over these points , count the number of non - isomorphic ramified coverings @xmath2 by a @xmath1-surface  @xmath3 , having the prescribed ramification types over the prescribed ramification points_.    two coverings are considered to be isomorphic if there is a homeomorphism of the covering surfaces taking the first covering to the second one .",
    "in fact , we count isomorphism classes with the weight equal to the inverse order of the group of automorphisms of the class ; in this form the problem is more natural , and admits a lot of applications .    in a more modern setting this problem can be reformulated as the computation of the gromov ",
    "witten invariants of the complex projective line .",
    "a detailed exposition of the history of the problem and a description of various approaches to its solution can be found in  @xcite .",
    "hurwitz  @xcite himself gave an explicit answer to the problem in the case , where the covering surface is also a sphere , and there is one ramification point with arbitrary ramification , while all others are points of simple ramification . in spite of the importance of the problem , only recently hurwitz s original results were extended to more general cases and treatable answers were obtained :    * i.  goulden and d.  jackson  @xcite solved the combinatorial problem that allows one to give the answer to hurwitz s problem for polynomials ( that is , ramified coverings of the sphere by a sphere having a point with a single preimage and arbitrary ramification over other points ) ; later their results were reestablished in  @xcite and  @xcite by absolutely different methods ; * t.  ekedahl , s.  lando , m.  shapiro , and a.  vainshtein  @xcite gave an expression for the number of ramified coverings of the sphere by a surface of arbitrary genus with a single point of arbitrary ramification type and all other points of simple ramification , in terms of intersection indices on moduli spaces of curves ( when the covering surface is the sphere , the answer given by the formula coincides with hurwitz s one ) ; another proof of the formula was given in @xcite .",
    "here we address the special case of the hurwitz problem , where the covering surface is also a sphere , but in contrast to the hurwitz case , ramification points of arbitrary type are allowed .",
    "we are far from solving the problem in this generality , but we suggest a general approach , and show how it works in some special cases , thus producing new enumerative results .    to a ramification point",
    "(= a critical value ) of multiplicity @xmath4 we assign a partition @xmath5 of @xmath4 , called the _ ramification type_. the elements of @xmath5 are the multiplicities of the critical points that correspond to our critical value .    recall the hurwitz theorem .",
    "the number @xmath6 of degree  @xmath7 coverings of the sphere by the sphere , having the ramification type  @xmath8 over one point , @xmath9 , while all other ramification points are fixed and simple , is @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the order of the automorphism group of the partition  @xmath5 , @xmath12 is the number of nondegenerate ramification points , and @xmath13 is the number of simple preimages of the multiple ramification point .    as a consequence of our approach",
    "we obtain , in the second part of this paper  @xcite , for example , the following result .",
    "the number @xmath14 of degree  @xmath7 coverings of the sphere by the sphere , having two double critical points and @xmath15 simple critical points , all the @xmath16 critical values being fixed , is @xmath17    as far as we know , this formula , as well as similar formulas for some other ramification types , is new .",
    "first of all we reduce the problem to the calculation of the degree of some map , called the lyashko  looijenga map .",
    "this step is now standard .",
    "the lyashko  looijenga map ( below , the @xmath18 map ) takes a meromorphic function to the set of its critical values .",
    "its source space can be chosen in a variety of ways ; here we define the @xmath18 map on the hurwitz space @xmath19 constructed in  @xcite .",
    "it is the space of stable maps from genus zero complex curves to the projective line , having trivial ramification over infinity .",
    "all spaces of functions possessing degenerate ramification are considered as subvarieties in this space .",
    "these subvarieties form a stratification of the hurwitz space .",
    "[ thmml ] the number @xmath20 of ramified coverings of the sphere , having the ramification types @xmath21 over prescribed ramification points with multiplicities @xmath22 , is given by the formula @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the degree of the @xmath18 map restricted to the stratum @xmath25 consisting of functions with these ramification types .",
    "this is an instance of a general situation , see e.g.  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if we fix a ramified covering @xmath26 and choose a complex structure on the target sphere  @xmath27 , then there exists a unique complex structure on the covering surface  @xmath3 making the function  @xmath28 into a meromorphic function .",
    "this complex structure is produced by the riemann construction .",
    "hence , there is a one - to - one correspondence between ramified coverings with fixed ramification points of given types and meromorphic functions with fixed critical values of the same types .",
    "the latter number is exactly the degree of the @xmath18 map on the corresponding moduli space .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 results from the fact that in our construction of the space @xmath19 we choose a numbering of the @xmath7 poles of each rational function .",
    "the factor @xmath30 is due to the fact that if we permute the ramification types @xmath31 preserving the multiplicities @xmath22 , we obtain a new set of ramified coverings that lie on the same stratum @xmath25 and have the same image under the @xmath18 map .",
    "the space  @xmath19 is , in fact , a vector bundle over the deligne ",
    "mumford moduli space @xmath32 of stable genus zero curves .",
    "the latter space is a smooth projective variety .",
    "the multiplicative group  @xmath33 of nonzero complex numbers acts on this bundle fiberwise .",
    "this action consists in just multiplying a meromorphic function by a constant .",
    "it preserves the stratification of the space  @xmath19 because the multiplication does not change the type of singularities . deleting the zero section of the bundle and taking the quotient modulo this action we reduce the variety to the projectivization  @xmath34 of the vector bundle  @xmath19 .",
    "the projectivization  @xmath34 carries the tautological line bundle @xmath35 , and a natural cohomology class @xmath36 , @xmath37 , the class of a hyperplane section .",
    "the degree of the lyashko ",
    "looijenga map restricted to a subvariety in  @xmath19 is related to the intersection index of the subvariety with the complementary power of the class @xmath38 .",
    "namely , the following statement is true .",
    "[ thm1.4 ] the degree @xmath24 of the @xmath18 map restricted to the stratum @xmath25 is equal to @xmath39 here  @xmath4 is the dimension of the stratum @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the multiplicity of the @xmath42th ramification point ( or the sum of the elements of @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 is the coupling between a homology and a cohomology class .",
    "this theorem is proved in section  [ ssec : strathur ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm1.4 ] implies that our approach requires the study of the cohomology ring @xmath45 .",
    "all cohomology groups we consider are with complex coefficients , and we do not specify the coefficients explicitly .",
    "we need    * a reasonable description of this ring , say , in terms of generators and relations ; * reasonable expressions for the cohomology classes of the strata and the class  @xmath38 in terms of the generators .",
    "the solution of the first problem is known since the space  @xmath19 is a vector bundle over the moduli space of stable rational curves , whose cohomology is known .",
    "the second problem seems to be much more difficult .",
    "in fact , we need less than the whole cohomology ring . the symmetric group  @xmath46 acts on the space  @xmath19 by permuting the indices , whence it acts on the cohomology space  @xmath45 .",
    "all the cohomology classes we are interested in are symmetric with respect to this action .",
    "therefore , we only need to know the @xmath46-symmetric part of the cohomology algebra  @xmath45 .",
    "this is an additional problem , but its solution can lead to a simplification of the decompositions of the strata .    the situation would become even easier if we restrict ourselves to the subalgebra in the cohomology algebra  @xmath45 generated by the classes of the strata .",
    "consider two closed codimension  1 subvarieties @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath19 ; the first of them is called the _",
    "caustic _ and it is the closure of the space of functions having a critical point of order  @xmath1 , the second one is the _ maxwell stratum _ and it is the closure of the space of functions having two distinct critical points with coinciding critical values .",
    "[ conj : kazarian ] the subalgebra of the cohomology algebra @xmath45 generated by the cohomology classes of the strata is generated by the two classes @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath49 .    up to now , the basis of this conjecture is not too solid .",
    "but it does not contradict our sample calculations , and it has a nonformal justification coming from kazarian s theory .",
    "kazarian s theory concerns cohomology classes of multisingulatities of a map @xmath50 of two complex manifolds , @xmath51 .",
    "its main statement claims that there is a universal way to express these cohomology classes in terms of the characteristic classes of the tangent bundles over the two manifolds @xmath52 and @xmath53 , more precisely in terms of the class @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total chern class .",
    "it is a development of the theory of the thom polynomial . up to now , only a preliminary version  @xcite of the text describing the theory is available , and we are not going to refer directly to statements from it .",
    "however , the ideology of the theory seems to be applicable in the situation we are studying , and it leads to a number of conjectures concerning the part of the cohomology ring of the hurwitz spaces we are interested in .    in our situation , the variety @xmath52 is the universal curve @xmath56 over the hurwitz space @xmath34 , while the variety @xmath53 is the quotient of @xmath57 by the natural @xmath33 action .",
    "the map @xmath28 is the universal map over @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to see that the map @xmath28 almost identifies the tangent spaces @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; more precisely , one has @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are first chern classes of some linear bundles .",
    "however , new complications arise , since we are interested in cohomology classes of @xmath34 and not of @xmath56 .",
    "kazarian s ideology leads to conjecture  [ conj : kazarian ] .",
    "if the conjecture is true , then the computation of intersection numbers of the strata in the hurwitz space with the complementary powers of the class @xmath36 can be split into two independent stages :    * express the cohomology class of the required stratum as a ( homogeneous ) polynomial in the classes  @xmath48 and  @xmath47 ; * find the intersection index of each monomial in  @xmath48 and  @xmath47 with the complementary degree of the class  @xmath38 .    another cohomology class in @xmath49 is also distinguished .",
    "this is the class @xmath63 dual to the subvariety of functions defined on singular curves .",
    "this class also can be expressed in terms of the classes @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this means that the subring in @xmath45 generated by the classes @xmath47 and @xmath48 coincides with that generated by @xmath38 and @xmath63 .",
    "the linear relations relating these four classes are as follows : @xmath64",
    "the coefficients in these linear relations are polynomial in  @xmath7 , which ( together with the informal support of kazarian s theory ) allows us to sharpen conjecture  1.5 in the following way :    each cohomology class dual to a stratum in  @xmath34 can be expressed as a homogeneous polynomial in  @xmath65 whose coefficients that are polynomials in  @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the calculations must even be simplified .      in section",
    "2 we give precise definitions of notions mentioned in this introduction .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the description of the lyashko  looijenga map . in section  4",
    "the structure of cohomology of the hurwitz spaces is analyzed .",
    "we are greatful to a.  zorich who invited us both to rennes , where the main part of this work was accomplished .",
    "the work was completed during our participation in the mini - workshop on hurwitz theory and its ramifications , and we thank its organizers j.  h.  kwak and a.  d.  mednykh for inviting us .",
    "we also thank b.  shapiro and m.  shapiro for their interest and m.  kazarian for explaining the basics of his theory .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the definitions of stable curves and stable maps ( we will restrict our attention to curves of genus 0 ) , as well as the definition of the hurwitz space  @xmath19 from  @xcite .",
    "consider the riemann sphere @xmath0 with @xmath66 distinct numbered marked points on it .",
    "two choices of marked points are considered equivalent if there exists an automorphism of @xmath0 sending one set of marked points to the other , preserving their numbering .",
    "the space of all nonequivalent choices of @xmath7 numbered marked points on @xmath0 can be endowed with a natural structure of a smooth irreducible ( noncompact ) complex manifold of dimension @xmath67 .",
    "we denote this moduli space by  @xmath68 .",
    "[ exm3m4 ] the space @xmath69 is a point , because any triple of points on @xmath0 can be sent to any other triple by a biholomorphic map .",
    "similarly , @xmath70 is isomorphic to @xmath71 ( here we suppose that the projective line is endowed with an arbitrary complex coordinate ) . indeed , for any four marked points on @xmath0 one can send the first three to @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the fourth marked point will be sent to some uniquely determined point @xmath75 , different from @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , and this value of @xmath75 is the point of @xmath70 .",
    "the spaces @xmath68 are compactified by adding to them new points corresponding to singular stable curves .",
    "all the curves under consideration are compact .",
    "the only singularities allowed are simple _ nodes _ , or _",
    "double points _ ( as at the origin in the plane curve @xmath76 ) ; such curves are called _",
    "nodal_.    separating the two branches of a nodal curve at each node , we obtain a disjoint union of smooth compact curves , which is called the _ normalization _ of the original curve .",
    "the connected components of the normalization are the _",
    "irreducible components _ of the curve .",
    "associate to a nodal curve a graph whose vertices correspond to the connected components of the normalization , and two vertices are connected by an edge iff the corresponding components intersect at a node ( loops appear if a component intersects itself ) .",
    "this graph is called the _ modular graph _ of the nodal curve . by definition ,",
    "the genus of a nodal curve is zero if all connected components of its normalization are projective lines , and the modular graph is a tree .",
    "a _ stable genus 0 curve _ is a nodal curve of genus  @xmath72 with @xmath7 distinct marked and numbered points satisfying the following conditions : ( i ) the marked points do not coincide with the nodal points ; ( ii ) the number of automorphisms of the curve preserving the marked points is finite .",
    "the second condition is equivalent to the following easily verifiable condition ( ii ) : the total number of marked and nodal points on every irreducible component of the nodal curve is greater than or equal to  @xmath77 .    the space of genus zero stable curves with  @xmath7 marked points is endowed with a natural structure of a smooth irreducible compact complex manifold of dimension @xmath67 ; we denote this space by  @xmath78 .",
    "the space  @xmath68 of smooth curves form a dense subvariety in  @xmath78 .    apart from smooth curves ,",
    "there are exactly @xmath77 stable genus 0 curves with @xmath79 marked points .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ figm4 ] .",
    "if @xmath75 from example  [ exm3m4 ] tends to @xmath72 ( respectively , @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) , the corresponding smooth curve tends to the 3rd ( respectively 2nd , or 1st ) stable curve in the figure .",
    "accordingly , @xmath80 is obtained from @xmath70 by adding three initially punctured points .",
    "actually , @xmath80 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "now consider the space of meromorphic functions on @xmath0 with exactly @xmath81 numbered simple poles .",

    "when @xmath66 , if we forget the function itself and only remember the positions of its poles , we obtain a map from the space of functions onto @xmath68 .",
    "because of this , we will often say `` marked points '' instead of `` poles of @xmath28 '' .    we are going to construct a compactification of the space of meromorphic functions following  @xcite , similar to that of the moduli space @xmath68 . to do that",
    ", we will need to define meromorphic functions on nodal curves .",
    "a meromorphic function @xmath28 on a nodal curve @xmath3 is simply a meromorphic function defined on each irreducible component of the nodal curve .",

    "for example , when we write @xmath325 , in the particular case @xmath291 the corresponding intersection index is equal to @xmath1 .          before proving the lemmas , let us make use of them to compute the total intersection indices .",
    "( for @xmath38 we use the expression from proposition  [ propidentities ] . )",
    "we have @xmath335 @xmath336 @xmath337 @xmath327 for other pairs @xmath328 . and @xmath338 this is consistent with the identity @xmath339 that we must prove",
    ".    moreover , looking at the intersection indices with the classes @xmath288 we conclude immediately that the families @xmath319 for different @xmath282 and @xmath283 allow one to distinguish any linear combinations of the classes @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , the identity follows from the three lemmas , that we will now prove .",
    "such a stable function belongs to the stratum @xmath340 , but not to other strata @xmath320 , nor to the caustic @xmath47 .",
    "it is easy to check that the intersection with @xmath340 is simple ( unless @xmath291 , in which case it is double by the definition of @xmath341 ) .      when @xmath330 the function @xmath28 is defined on a curve with @xmath7 irreducible components shown in figure  [ fig : case2 ] .",
    "such a stable function belongs to @xmath342 different irreducible components of @xmath343 and to one irreducible component of @xmath344 .",
    "it is easy to check that the intersection with each component is simple .",
    "now we must find the index of intersection of the family @xmath319 with the caustic @xmath47 at the point that we are considering .",
    "this is more difficult , because this point does not belong to the smooth part of the caustic . in order to find the intersection index we have to use a result of the subsequent paper  @xcite , theorem  3.9 . in the particular case under consideration",
    "the assertion of this theorem is as follows .",
    "consider the subvariety of @xmath34 obtained from the stable function @xmath28 by moving in all possible ways the @xmath345 points of intersection of the peripheral components with the central component of the curve in figure  [ fig : case2 ] , without changing the restrictions of @xmath28 to the peripheral components .",
    "the closure of this subvariety is isomorphic to @xmath346 .",
    "now , the theorem says that the neighborhood of this subvariety in @xmath34 is isomorphic to the neighborhood of @xmath347 in @xmath348 .",
    "moreover , the intersection of the caustic @xmath47 with this neighborhood is isomorphic to @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is the ( non - projectivized ) caustic in the smaller hurwitz space .",
    "the intersection of the family @xmath319 with the neighborhood is a generic complex curve that intersects the subvariety @xmath346 transversally and is not contained in @xmath349 .",
    "now we claim that the intersection of the caustic @xmath350 with a generic fiber of @xmath351 over @xmath346 is a hypersurface of degree @xmath352 , which is therefore the index of intersection between @xmath319 and @xmath47 at the point under consideration .",
    "it remains to check that @xmath352 is indeed the degree of the intersection of @xmath350 with a generic fiber of @xmath351 over @xmath346 . to do that it suffices to find the degree of @xmath353 as a polynomial in variables @xmath354 ( discrim means discriminant",
    ", numer means numerator ) .",
    "indeed , this polynomial is precisely the equation of the caustic @xmath350 in the fiber , where the poles are fixed at the points @xmath355 .",
    "the division by @xmath356 is needed because , as one can easily check , the hyperplanes @xmath357 are simple zeroes of the discriminant , but do not belong to the caustic .",
    "the degree of the above polynomial is indeed equal to @xmath352 for homogeneity reasons .      in order to calculate the intersection of @xmath47 with the family @xmath319 outside the points where some poles get glued together",
    ", we will consider the discriminant of the derivative of the function @xmath28 of our family @xmath358 the degree of this discriminant as a homogeneous polynomial in @xmath359 and @xmath360 equals @xmath361 .",
    "one can check that this polynomial has double zeroes at the points @xmath330 .",
    "moreover , it has a zero of multiplicity @xmath362 at @xmath316 and a zero of multiplicity @xmath363 at @xmath317 . subtracting the multiplicities of all these zeroes , we obtain @xmath334 zeroes outside the points @xmath364",
