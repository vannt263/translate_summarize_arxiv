    "a lesson given by the history of cosmology is that the concept of the cosmological term revives in the days of crisis and we have more reasons than ever to belive that the cosmological term is the necessary ingredient of any cosmological model.the possibility of adding a cosmological vacuum energy density to the einstein field equations raises the question empirical justification of such a step .",
    "a positive cosmological constant helps overcome the age problem , conected on the one side with the high estimates of the hubble parameters and with the age of the globular clusters on the other .",
    "further , it seems that in order to retain the cold dark matter theory in the spacially flat universe most of the critical density should be provided by a passitive cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "observationnal data indicate that the cosmologial constant , if nonzero , is smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "however , since everything that contributes to the vacuum energy acts as a cosmological constant it can not just be dropped without serious considerations .",
    "moreover particle physics expectations for @xmath3 exceeds its present value by the factor of order @xmath4 ie in a sharp contrast to observations . to explain this apparent discrepancy",
    "the point of view has been adopted which allow the @xmath3 term to vary in time @xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "the idea of that during the evolution of universe the energy density of the vacuum decays into the particles thus leading to the decrease of the cosmological constant . as the result one has the creation of particles although the typical rate of the creation is very small .",
    "the creation of matter and entropy from vacuum has been studied via quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "most cosmological models exhibit a singurarity which presents difficulties for interpreting quantum effects , because all macroscopic parameters of created particles are infinite there.this leads to the problem of the initial vacuum.a regular vacuum for species of the created particles can be defined in simple terms as a state where all mean values describing the particles , such as energy density , number density , entropy etc are zero .",
    "but this simple condition is not achieved in many scenarios , so that either one has to postulate an initial state beyond the singularity , or to assume that there was a non - zero number of particles at the initial vacuum .",
    "one attempt to overcome these problems is via incorporating the effect of particle creation into einstein s field equactions . in the present study",
    "i interpret the source of created particles as a decaying vacuum , described phenomenologically by a time - dependent cosmological constant @xmath6 .",
    "there are significant observational evidence for the detection of einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath3 or a component of material content of the universe that varies slowly with time and space to act like @xmath7 .",
    "some of the recent discussions on the cosmological constant `` problem '' and on cosmology with a time - varying cosmological constant by ratra and peebles @xcite , and sahni and starobinsky @xcite , point out that in the absence of any interaction with matter or radiation , the cosmological constant remains a `` constant''.however , in the presence of interactions with matter or radiation , a solution of einstein equations and the assumed equation of covariant conservation of stress - energy with a time - varying @xmath3 can be found .",
    "this entails that energy has to be conserved by a decrease in the energy density of the vacuum component followed by a corresponding increase in the energy density of matter or radiation ( see also carroll , press and turner @xcite , peebles @xcite , padmanabhan @xcite).there is a plethora of astrophysical ev- idence today , from supernovae measurements ( perlmutter et al .",

    "the energy budget of the universe seems to be dominated at the present epoch by a mysterious dark energy component , but the precise nature of this energy is still unknown .",
    "many theoretical models provide possible explanations for the dark energy , ranging from a cosmological term @xcite to super - horizon perturbations @xcite and time- varying quintessence scenarios @xcite .",
    "these recent observations strongly favour a significant and a positive value of @xmath0 with magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "the standard friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model prescribes a homogeneous and an isotropic distribution for its matter in the description of the present state of the universe . at the present state of evolution ,",
    "the universe is spherically symmetric and the matter distribution in the universe is on the whole isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "but in early stages of evolution , it could have not had such a smoothed picture .",
    "close to the big bang singularity , neither the assumption of spherical symmetry nor that of isotropy can be strictly valid .",
    "so we consider plane - symmetric , which is less restrictive than spherical symmetry and can provide an avenue to study inhomogeneities .",
