    "therefore , the identification and definition of all the stellar components belonging to the sgr dsph is crucial not only to understand the star formation history ( sfh ) and chemical evolution of this keystone galaxy , but also to trace its remnants in the galactic halo .",
    "the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the sgr galaxy is dominated by the classical features of a metal - rich population , with a red and extended red giant branch ( rgb ) and a red clump ( rc ) of he - burning stars @xcite .",
    "it is now generally recognized that this dominant population has a mean age of 4 - 6 gyr ( @xcite hereafter ls00 , @xcite , hereafter pap - i ) and a high mean metallicity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ls00 , pap - i ) .",
    "the apparent absence of old and metal poor stars ( oms ) in sgr was noted since the early studies and persists , in part , at the present day .",
    "however , oms should be present , since ( a ) previous generations of stars are required to enrich the medium from which the dominant metal - rich population has formed and ( b ) the sgr dsph hosts at least two classical old and metal poor globular cluster ( ter  8 and m  54 , see * ? ?",
    "* , respectively ) .",
    "hence , we have observational evidence that oms were formed in sgr , even if just in globular clusters . unfortunately , the search for rgb stars bluer than the main rgb of sgr ( hence , presumably , more metal poor ) has been hampered by the strong contamination by foreground stars affecting the cmd .",
    "therefore , the available spectroscopic surveys included only a negligible fraction of stars with @xmath2<-1 $ ] @xcite .    a blue horizontal branch ( bhb )",
    "sequence is easily recognizeable in the wide - field photographic cmd of @xcite and it can be considered a clear indication of the presence of oms in sgr : however this population has never been further observed in any successive sgr ccd survey .",
    "some additional indirect clues of the existence of a metal - poor population in sgr exist in the literature , in particular :    1 .",
    "@xcite surveyed an isolated field in sgr and found a star count excess in a region of the cmd similar in magnitude and color to the hb of ter  8 .",
    "however , due to the few ( 23 ) sgr bhb candidates , this was considered just as a supporting evidence that old and metal poor stars exist in the field of sgr .",
    "2 .   @xcite analized the light curve of @xmath01800 rr lyrae in the sgr galaxy . from the location of the rrd variables in the petersen diagram he concluded that rr lyrae in sgr have metallicities in the range @xmath3@xmath4 ( see also ls00 ; * ? ? ?",
    "since rr lyrae stars are thought to trace old populations ( 10 gyr ) , this result is a convincing proof that some old and metal poor stars are present in the sgr field population . according to @xcite ,",
    "the central density of rr lyrae in sgr is @xmath5 stars / deg@xmath6 .",
    "since we found ( pap - i ) @xmath02000 stars / deg@xmath6 belonging to the red clump , the rr lyrae should account for just @xmath06% of the whole hb population .",
    "in this letter we use the cmd of a large area ( @xmath7 deg@xmath6 ) in the main body of the sgr dsph ( pap - i ) to show that a significant bhb population is indeed present in sgr .",
    "we also show that the bhb is most likely the counterpart of the analogous feature found in the sgr stream by @xcite .",
    "the database presented in pap - i contains v and i photometry of @xmath0490,000 sources down to @xmath8 in a @xmath7 deg@xmath6 field centered on the globular cluster m  54 , which coincides with the position of the maximum density peak of the sgr galaxy ( see pap - i for further details ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a zoom of the hb region of the cmd , at different distances from the center of m  54 .",
    "panel ( a ) refers to stars contained within the tidal radius of m  54 must always be intended as the tidal radius of the globular cluster m  54 . ]",
    "( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "as can be seen , although the galactic foreground stars ( vertical structure at v - i@xmath110.8 ) and the main sgr population ( red clump at @xmath12 ) are easily recognizable , the population of m  54 obviously dominates the cmd .",
    "in particular the cluster rgb , ranging from ( v , v - i)@xmath0(21 , 0.9 ) up to ( 16.4 , 1.3 ) , and the well known bhb , at v - i0.4 from @xmath13 down to @xmath14 , are clearly evident ( see also ls00 and references therein ) . the bhb sequence of m  54 has been enclosed in a box that is repeated in all panels .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the cmd of stars lying at r@xmath15r@xmath16 : as expected , while the rgb of m  54 disappears , the galactic foreground and the sgr population dominate the cmd at this distance from m  54 .",
    "however , the most surprising feature is the unexpected presence of a conspicuous population of bhb ( see also panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the bhb population ( and in particular its brightest bulk at v@xmath1718.6 ) remains quite numerous even in the most external part ( @xmath18 ) of the surveyed region ( see panel ( d ) ) .",
    "figure 1 thus demonstrates that a significant bhb population is indeed present in the main body of the sgr galaxy , as previously suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the bhb found in sgr is quite similar to that of m  54 , although the faintest part of the sequence ( v@xmath1518.6 ) appears less populated with respect to m  54 .    in order to further test the connection between the bhb population and the sgr galaxy , we have selected two different stellar samples ( shown in the left panel of figure 2 ) and we have compared their radial distributions .",
    "the first sample contains stars belonging to the rc and therefore traces the distribution of stars belonging exclusively to the sgr galaxy .",
    "the second contains stars belonging to the brightest part of the bhb only ( v@xmath1718.6 ) to avoid spurious effects due to incompleteness and contamination by the blue plume .",
    "the bhb sample should therefore trace the bhb of m  54 plus the contribution of the sgr bhb .",
    "figure 3 shows the cumulative radial distribution of the two adopted test samples outside @xmath19 ( left panel ) and @xmath20 ( right panel ) . as can ben seen from both panels of figure 3 the two samples appear remarkably similar .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test provides a large probability ( @xmath1566% ) that the two distributions are extracted from the same parent population , supporting the idea that bhb stars outside m  54 actually belong to the sgr galaxy .",
    "figure 4 shows instead the cumulative distribution of the two samples for @xmath21 , well inside the tidal radius of m  54 , but still far enough from the very core of the cluster , where crowding becomes severe .",
    "the cumulative radial profile of m  54 is represented by a king model @xcite with @xmath22 and c=1.84 @xcite . from the inspection of the figure it is then evident that , even inside @xmath19 , the cumulative distribution of the bhb sample is significantly different from the star distribution in m  54 .",
    "in fact , to reproduce the observed bhb sample distribution , we need to use a combined population .",
    "figure 4 shows that the global distribution of bhb stars is nicely reproduced by a composite population with ( approximately ) @xmath030% of stars contributed by m  54 and @xmath070% by sgr .",
    "however , a good agreement can also be achieved by varying the relative fractions by @xmath010% .",
    "in the previous section we report convincing evidence that a substantial population of bhb is present in the main body of sgr .",
    "the existence of this population was missed by all previous photometric ccd surveys , probably due to an unsufficient field of view .",
    "this recovery can shed light on different aspects of the structure and the history of this disrupting stellar system .",
    "the presence of a well - populated bhb in sgr implies the presence of a substantial population of oms in this galaxy .",
    "in fact , bhb have been , up to now , observed only in old , metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "the only exceptions are two metal - rich and very dense globular clusters belonging to the bulge @xcite .",
    "however , bhb stars appear spatially segregated toward the center of these clusters , suggesting a dynamical origin for these stars @xcite . due to the extremely low stellar density conditions",
    ", this kind of formation channel appears quite unlikely in the case of the sgr galaxy .",
    "thus , with a morphology that is very similar to that of the old , metal - poor clusters associated to the sgr : ter  8 ( [ fe / h]@xmath23 ) and m  54 ( [ fe / h]@xmath24 ) , the bhb sequence of sgr is more likely composed of genuine oms stars .",
    "moreover , although it is often difficult to place precise constraints on age and metallicity from the study of the hb morphology alone , we can anyway put some limits to the age and metallicity of the bhb population by observing that stars bluer than the rr lyrae should be at least as old and metal - poor as the rr lyrae themselves . in particular rr lyrae stars are known to trace old populations ( @xmath2510 gyr ) .",
    "hence , by combining this with the results by @xcite , it can be concluded that _ the sgr bhb population is composed by old and metal - poor stars , with ages greater than @xmath010 gyr and metallicities lower than [ fe / h]@xmath11 - 1.3_.      we select all the rc stars with @xmath26 ( lower selection box in the right panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "then we estimate the level of foreground contamination by counting stars within a box adjacent to the rc sample box ( upper selection box in the right panel of figure 2 ) having the same size , and we obtain n@xmath27@xmath01000 stars/0.95  deg@xmath6 ( we consider all stars with @xmath26 , i.e. a total area of 0.95  deg@xmath6 ) .",
    "we use this estimate to clean the rc sample , obtaining a final rc density of n@xmath28@xmath02000 stars/0.95  deg@xmath6 . in the same region , we counted stars belonging to the bright bhb sample defined in figure 2 , obtaining n@xmath29147 stars/0.95  deg@xmath6 . finally , from the work of @xcite , the expected number of rr lyrae is n@xmath30@xmath11130 stars/0.95  deg@xmath6 .",
    "we conclude that _ the fraction of old and metal - poor stars in the sgr galaxy is @xmath012% . _ therefore , while the most important episodes of star formation in the sgr galaxy occurred between 4 and 6 gyr ago ( pap - i , corresponding , @xmath31 and @xmath32 has been assumed . ] to @xmath33 ) from a quite metal - rich ( [ m / h]-0.6 ) interstellar medium , a non negligible fraction of metal poor stars were already in place more than 10 gyr ago ( @xmath342 ) .",
    "@xcite estimated a larger , but still compatible , fraction of oms : @xmath3530% .",
    "however it has to be noted that our estimate should be considered a lower limit since a larger fraction can be obtained if fainter bhb are taken into account .",
    "recently @xcite , using the early data release of the sloan digital sky survey , sdss , report on the discovery of an unexplained stellar population in a region of the sky named s341 + 57 - 22.5 , in the direction @xmath36 .",
    "the authors suggest that the unknown population is part of the sgr stream since ( 1 ) s341 + 57 - 22.5 lies on the predicted sgr s orbital path ( according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( 2 ) the cmd is quite similar to that of the sgr galaxy published by @xcite , with the notable exception of a bhb sequence which was lacking in any previous cmd of sgr ( with the only exception of the photographic cmd by * ? ? ?",
    "we used the same equations that @xcite applied to the ( v , v - i ) photometry of @xcite to transform our photometry into the sdss photometric system , adopting the same distance and reddening as well .",
    "the bhb presented in this letter is then located in the cmd at @xmath37 , a position which is fully compatible with the bhb sequence discovered by @xcite .",
    "thus , the bhb population found by @xcite in the sgr stream corresponds to the bhb population found in the sgr galaxy .",
    "this implies that the disruption of the sgr dsph provided a sizeable contribution to the assembly of the galactic halo not only in the form of metal - rich stars ( traced by the m giants studied by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but also providing a substantial amount of old and metal - poor stars that constitute the typical halo population .      300 bellazzini , m. , ferraro , f.r . ,",
