    "this second manifold has a different metric and a different curvature tensor @xmath23 , but we argue that the masses of particles are determined by @xmath24 @xcite and hence the masses of classical particles are unaltered .",

    "we choose to restrict the motion to the @xmath143 plane . using @xmath144 for the constant of angular momentum and @xmath145 for the energy of the test body",

    "objects with low radial velocities experience an acceleration of @xmath157 to second order in @xmath94 . thus to first order , @xmath158      assuming that @xmath94 is very small ( typically less than @xmath159 ) we find that ( to first order in @xmath94 ) @xmath160 . if @xmath161 is very small , the @xmath162 term could be significant , but for typical galaxies this is not the case .",
    "this is because the values of @xmath48 are typically on the order of @xmath163 cm .",
    "thus the @xmath156 term is estimated to be much , much less than @xmath164 and we will drop it in our second order approximations . to compute @xmath165 , we use the formula , @xmath166 and use ( [ rddot ] ) setting @xmath167 and @xmath168 to zero for a circular orbit . the result to second order is @xmath169 the second order differences in radial acceleration between ( [ e86 ] ) and ( [ e84a ] ) may be explained by the nonzero pressure terms in the stress - energy tensor ( [ e65 ] ) . to first order , @xmath170 for example if @xmath171 ( fairly typical for a galaxy ) then @xmath172km / s .",
    "this constant velocity curve would extend from the disk out to the boundary of the halo .",
    "the baryonic tully - fisher relation @xcite states that @xmath173 . from ( [ kdef ] ) and ( [ e84 ] ) we see that @xmath174 .",
    "thus we have a general result : @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a universal constant acceleration and the coefficient , @xmath177 is chosen for convenience .",
    "mcgaugh , lelli and schombert @xcite have recently reported a correlation between the radial acceleration that is observed and the radial acceleration due to the baryons . from the definition of @xmath94 , ( [ kdef ] )",
    "we see that @xmath94 is basically the gravitational potential at @xmath178 and in our model it also is basically the gravitational potential at @xmath179 , since @xmath180 . using the value of @xmath93",
    ", we have the baryonic acceleration given by @xmath181 .",
    "thus @xmath182 .",
    "we relate the observed acceleration to the rotation curve via @xmath183 .",
    "we assume that @xmath94 is very small and use the first order approximation ( [ e84 ] ) to find @xmath184 , for @xmath185 .",
    "thus our theory leads to the following relation ( to first order in @xmath94 ) : @xmath186 according to @xcite , @xmath187 is a universal radial acceleration relation for galaxies .",
    "mcgaugh , lelli and schombert @xcite based this on analysis of 153 galaxies , including bulge - dominated spirals , disk - dominated spirals and gas - dominated dwarfs .",
    "they find that the value of the acceleration - parameter @xmath176 , which accurately models the relationship given in ( [ rar0 ] ) , is approximately @xmath188 m / s@xmath189 .",
    "we stipulate that the two formulae ( [ rar1 ] ) and ( [ rar0 ] ) should agree when when @xmath190 .",
    "thus we find @xmath191 agreeing with ( [ gdagger ] ) .",
    "thus our theory suggests that @xmath192 when @xmath193 , the implication is that there is no significant amount of dark matter . from ( [ rar3 ] )",
    "we find that @xmath194 which we call the critical baryonic - acceleration constant denoted by @xmath195 .",
    "hence from the value found for @xmath176 ( see @xcite ) , we find the critical baryonic - acceleration constant to be @xmath196 from ( [ rar2 ] ) and ( [ rar4 ] ) , we also find that @xmath197 which matches well with our hypothesis that for @xmath198 , there is only baryonic matter present .",
    "finally , define the parameter @xmath199 for a given galaxy , by @xmath200 , which indicates the ratio of the total mass to the baryonic mass .",
    "the consensus value is @xmath201 .",
    "then when @xmath202 , we find that @xmath203 .",
    "thus we propose the following model for the relationship between the baryonic acceleration and the observed acceleration : @xmath204 the graph of our radial acceleration relation is shown in figure 1 for values of @xmath205 which are greater than @xmath206 .",
    "we also include the plot of ( [ rar0 ] ) using the value @xmath207 m / s@xmath189 .",
    "the difference between these graphs is small and appears to be within 1.0 rms according to mcgaugh , lelli and schombert @xcite .",
    "we note that our model is highly idealized and thus when numerical solutions of our field equations are produced that more closely resemble the actual distribution of baryonic matter , then we expect that the model will approach the curve given in ( [ rar0 ] ) .",
    "when we combine the predictions of our theory with those of mcgaugh , lelli and schombert , the new and interesting conclusion is that @xmath208 m / s@xmath189 is a universal critical acceleration .",
    "the acceleration at the baryonic radius , @xmath85 , is given by @xmath209 .",
    "if @xmath195 is considered to be the fundamental constant that governs the dividing line between baryonic and dark matter , then @xmath94 may be determined for a given galaxy by finding the radius at the bulge . from ( [ e84 ] )",
    "we would then have a prediction of the value of @xmath165 .",

    "the theory based on the conservative transformation group leads to a spherically symmetric solution for the free field , which must have nonzero densities and pressures .",
    "our isothermal solution reasonably models galaxies that are bulge - dominated , but also gives insights into what more accurate models based on the conservative transformation group may predict .",
    "namely , that along with the baryonic tully - fisher relationship and the radial acceleration relation of mcgaugh , lelli and schombert , we obtain the prediction of a universal critical acceleration , @xmath195 .",
    "further progress in developing isothermal models that more closely model disk - dominated spirals and dwarf galaxies may strengthen these results .",
    "our extension of the covariance group to the conservative transformation group leads to automatic inclusion of dark matter and dark energy .",
