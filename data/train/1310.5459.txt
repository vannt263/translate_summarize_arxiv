    "exoplanet imaging is one of the most challenging areas in today s astronomy .",
    "the observation of an extremely faint object ( the planet ) very close to a bright source ( the host star ) requires the use of an extreme adaptive optics ( xao ) system coupled with a high - contrast imaging technique such as coronagraphy .",
    "the current generation of instruments dedicated to exoplanets direct imaging ( sphere on the vlt @xcite , gpi on gemini south @xcite , subaru scexao @xcite and palomar p1640 @xcite ) aim at detecting massive gaseous planets @xmath0 to @xmath2 times fainter than their host star . in the future ,",
    "high - contrast imaging instruments on ground based or space based telescopes will perform observation of earth - like planets , @xmath3 to @xmath4 times fainter than their host star .",
    "the ultimate limitation of a high - contrast imaging instrument lies in its quasi - static aberrations , which originate in imperfections of the optical system such as misalignment or optical surface polishing error .",
    "these aberrations , when unseen and thus uncorrected by the ao loop , create long - lived speckles on the detector plane @xcite , limiting the achievable contrast . besides , unlike the signal which originates in the residual turbulence ( averaged in a long exposure image ) , these speckles can easily be mistaken for a planet .",
    "thus , to reach the ultimate performance of the imaging system , one must be able to compensate for these aberrations . to perform such a compensation , sphere relies on phase diversity @xcite to reach a contrast of @xmath0 , whereas gpi relies on an interferometric approach @xcite for an aimed contrast of @xmath2 on the detector .",
    "several techniques dedicated to this compensation have been proposed .",
    "closed loop methods , which assume small aberrations ( @xcite ) , estimate the electric field in the detector plane using at least three images .",
    "the technique proposed by baudoz _",
    "_ @xcite relies on a modification of the imaging system , but requires only one image .",
    "we note that this approach , based on the analysis of fringed speckles , requires a @xmath5 oversampling of the coronagraphic images to properly sample the interference fringes .",
    "these techniques aim at minimizing the energy in a chosen area ( `` dark hole '' ) , leading to a contrast optimization on the detector in a closed loop process .",
    "the focal plane wave - front sensor we have proposed @xcite , called coffee ( for coronagraphic focal - plane wave - front estimation for exoplanet detection ) , requires only two focal - plane images to estimate the aberrations both upstream and downstream of the coronagraph without any modification of the coronagraphic imaging system or assuming small aberrations . in a previous study @xcite",
    ", we presented coffee s early performance and limitations , detailed below , as well as its sensitivity to a realistic experimental environment .",
    "in this paper , we present a high order extension of coffee and its performance evaluation in a compensation process , in the framework of the quasi - static aberration calibration of a ground - based instrument such as sphere .",
    "section [ est ] presents the modifications that allows coffee to overcome its previous limitations @xcite , allowing an estimation of high order aberrations with nanometric precision for any coronagraphic device .",
    "section [ perf ] presents the noise sensitivity of this extended version of coffee using realistic sphere - like simulations .",
    "the choice of a suitable diversity phase to use is also discussed in this section . knowing that in a real system , such a diversity phase will not be perfectly introduced , we present , in section [ myop ] , an original approach , hereafter called  myopic  , which significantly improves coffee s robustness to an imprecise knowledge of the diversity phase . finally , in section [ comp ]",
    ", we describe the different compensation processes which can be used with coffee .",
    "in particular , we present a method of energy minimization in the detector plane that allows the creation of a dark hole without any small aberration assumption . unlike other energy minimization methods @xcite",
    ", the one we propose does not rely on the calibration of an interaction matrix , which is sensitive to the position of the coronagraphic image on the detector .",
    "this new dark hole method can thus be used on any high contrast instrument without a repetitive dedicated calibration step .",
    "+ in the sphere baseline design , quasi - static aberrations are measured with conventional phase diversity @xcite ( no coronagraph ) , which is unable to sense high - order aberrations to a nanometric level . as a result",
    ", this high contrast imaging instrument performance will be limited by high - order phase aberrations and not by amplitude aberrations ( amplitude variations in a pupil plane ) .",
    "consequently , the latter are not considered in the simulations presented herein and are currently not estimated by coffee .",
    "coffee is based on an inverse problem approach : it estimates the aberrations both upstream and downstream of the coronagraph using two focal - plane images that differ from a known aberration .",
    "as described in @xcite , the two main error sources of the first version of coffee have been shown both by simulations and experimentally to be aliasing and modelling error .",
    "the former was due to the use of a zernike basis and prevented coffee from estimating high order aberrations . moreover , the estimation of these high order aberrations is mandatory to optimize the contrast in the detector far from the optical axis ( between a few @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the case of the sphere instrument ) .",
    "the latter was originating in the image formation model used by coffee .",
    "the estimations were indeed performed using a perfect coronagraph model , and thus limited by a model error . in practice , coffee s use was limited to the apodized roddier & roddier coronagraph .    in this section , we present coffee s modifications that allows to get rid of these two limitations .",
    "section [ est_expr ] describes the modification of the maximum _ a posteriori _ ( map )",
    "approach on which coffee is based , which includes a modification of the basis used for the aberration estimation , now composed of pupil indicator functions ( pixels ) .",
    "such a basis , used with a dedicated regularization metric described in section [ est_reg ] , allows coffee to estimate high - order aberrations .",
    "besides , thanks to the modification of the imaging model , described in section [ est_img ] , coffee is now able to perform the estimation for any coronagraphic device .",
    "most of the notations of this article are coherent with @xcite .",
    "we consider a coronagraphic imaging system made of four successive planes denoted by a ( circular entrance pupil of diameter @xmath8 ) , b ( coronagraphic focal plane ) , c ( lyot stop ) , and d ( detector plane ) .",
    "the optical aberrations are considered as static and introduced in pupil planes a and c. the coronagraphic device is composed of a focal plane mask located in plane b and a lyot stop in plane c. no particular assumption is made on the pupil shape or intensity , which can be calibrated using data recorded from the instrument .",
    "we note that this model does not consider out of plane aberrations and the corresponding amplitude aberrations ( which originate in fresnel effect ) , but as said previously , we consider in this paper the case of a ground based instrument ( such as sphere ) limited by phase aberrations .",
    "coffee requires only two images @xmath9 and @xmath10 recorded on the detector ( plane d ) that , as in phase diversity , differ from a known aberration @xmath11 , to estimate aberrations both upstream ( @xmath12 ) and downstream ( @xmath13 ) of the coronagraph .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of the instrument calibration , assumed to be performed at high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) value , with a monochromatic source , emitted from a single - mode laser fiber .",
    "since the impact of the source finite size on the estimation is not significant on the aberrations estimation @xcite , we consider here that this calibration is performed with an unresolved object , and use the following imaging model :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the incoming flux ( @xmath16 is for `` foc '' or `` div '' ) , @xmath17 the coronagraphic on axis `` point spread function '' ( psf ) of the instrument ( which is the response of a coronagraphic imaging system to a point source ) , @xmath18 the known detector psf , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the measurement noises and comprise both detector and photon noises , @xmath21 is a unknown uniform background ( offset ) , and @xmath22 denotes the discrete convolution operation .",
    "coffee is based on a maximum _ a posteriori _ ( map ) approach : it estimates the aberrations @xmath12 and @xmath13 as well as the fluxes @xmath23 $ ] , and the backgrounds @xmath24 $ ] that maximize the posterior likelihood @xmath25 of the data . for practical issues , it is more convenient ( and equivalent ) to minimize the opposite of the logarithm of the posterior likelihood , or neg - log - likelihood @xmath26 $ ] which includes regularization terms @xmath27 and @xmath28 designed to enforce smoothness of the sought phases : @xmath29\\ ] ] where @xmath30 @xmath31 denotes the sum of squared pixel values of map @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the noise standard deviation maps of each image .",
    "the corresponding variances can be computed as a sum of the photon and detector noise variances .",
    "the former can be estimated as the image itself thresholded to positive values , and the latter can be calibrated prior to the estimation .    any aberration @xmath35 is expanded on a basis @xmath36 . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the use of a truncated zernike basis for the reconstruction led to a strong aliasing error , let alone the inability to estimate high frequency aberrations . in this paper , the phase is expanded on pixel indicator functions in the pupil plane : @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 the value of the @xmath39th pixel in the pupil ) .",
    "such a basis , used with the proper regularization metrics , will allow coffee to estimate high order aberrations and strongly reduce the aliasing error , as shown in the following .",
    "the minimization of metric @xmath40 of eq .   is performed by means of a limited memory variable metric ( bfgs ) method ( @xcite ) , which is a fast quasi - newton type minimization method .",
    "it uses the analytical expression of gradients @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which we have calculated , to estimate @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( implementation details can be found in appendix [ app_grad ] ) .",
    "+ sauvage _ et al . _",
    "@xcite established that a suitable diversity phase @xmath11 for coffee was a mix of defocus and astigmatism : @xmath47 with @xmath48 , introduced upstream of the coronagraph . in this paper ,",
    "such a diversity phase will be used for a start ; the optimal phase diversity to be used with coffee will be discussed later .",
    "the use of a pixel basis for the phase reconstruction is required for coffee to estimate high order aberrations .",
    "however , this leads to a large number of unknowns , which in turn calls for a regularization metric in order to reduce the noise sensitivity .",
    "we chose a regularization metric that is based on the available _ a priori _ knowledge on the quasi - static aberrations .",
    "indeed , they can be reasonably assumed to be gaussian , homogeneous and thus endowed with a power spectral density ( psd ) @xmath49 ( where k stands for @xmath50 ( upstream ) or @xmath51 ( downstream ) ) , which is usually assumed to follow a power law : @xmath52 with @xmath53 the spatial frequency and @xmath54 the mean of @xmath55 .",
    "the regularization term @xmath56 can thus be written as : @xmath57(\\nu)}\\right|}^2}{s_{\\phi_k}(\\nu)},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 represent the fourier transform operation . in order to be able to cope with any pupil shape",
    ", we implement this metric in direct space rather than fourier space as follows ; for n=2 in eq .  , we obtain : @xmath59 and for n=4 in eq .",
    ", @xmath60 here , @xmath61 denotes the pupil plane position which will be omitted in the following for the sake of simplicity . @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath63 represent the gradient and the laplacian operators , respectively .",
    "the balance parameter @xmath64 will be called `` hyperparameter '' hereafter . for both cases ,",
    "derivatives @xmath65 and @xmath66 are computed as finite differences between neighboring points , and summations are limited to points whose computation requires only pixels inside the pupil . in this paper , we consider a psd decrease as @xmath67 ( @xmath68 in eq .  ) , which corresponds to a classical assumption for optical surface polishing errors , according to k. dohlen _ _ et al.__@xcite , who measured and characterized the psd of the sphere optical system . additionally , identification between eqs .",
    "and yields the analytic value of the hyperparameter @xmath64 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 the variances of @xmath74 in directions @xmath32 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the fact that the hyperparameter is given by eq .   stems from the assumption that the phase @xmath55 is statistically homogeneous , and is whitened by the differentiation in eq .",
    "one can notice that @xmath70 can be analytically computed from @xmath49 and the phase variance @xmath76 .",
    "thus , this regularization does not require any manual tuning .      to perform the minimization of criterion @xmath77 in eq .",

    "the chosen coronagraph ( alc ) is the one designed for the considered wavelength on sphere , and the apodization function used in the image formation model ( figure [ fig_apod ] ) is the one designed for this coronagraph . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of a high - contrast imaging instrument calibration prior to the scientific observation , so a monochromatic source is considered .",
    "it is worth mentioning that coffee could easily be adapted to polychromatic images , although such a study is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "such an adaptation would require a modification of the image formation model ( eq . ) , in which a polychromatic coronagraphic psf would be computed from several monochromatic psf for different wavelengths .    in order to properly model the alc coronagraph , the coronagraphic psf @xmath17 ( eq .  )",
    "is computed using the method developed by r. soummer _ et al .",
    "this approach allows an accurate numerical representation of lyot - style coronagraphs by accurately sampling the coronagraphic focal plane mask , which can hardly be done using the common fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm . such an operation would indeed require the manipulation of very large arrays .    for each simulation ,",
    "coronagraphic images are computed from randomly generated aberrations @xmath12 and @xmath13 using the imaging model presented in eqs   and .",
    "using these two images , coffee performs the phase estimation by minimizing criterion @xmath77 of eq .  .",
    "in order to quantify the reconstruction accuracy , we define the reconstruction error @xmath104 as the rms value of @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is either @xmath50 ( upstream ) or @xmath51 ( downstream ) , @xmath55 is the simulated aberration and @xmath107 its estimation made by coffee . in this section ,",

    "the psd @xmath108 of each generated phase is such that @xmath109 .",
    "the ultimate limitation of the estimation performed by coffee lies in the propagation of noise present in the images .",
    "as mentioned in section [ est_reg ] , the use of a suitable regularization metric ensures the smoothness of the phase , limiting the propagation of the noise from the images to the estimated aberrations . in this section , we first demonstrate that the analytic value of the regularization metric hyperparameter ( see section [ est_reg ] ) is the one that gives the smallest reconstruction error .",
    "we consider here an incoming flux @xmath110 photons and a read - out noise ( ron ) of standard deviation @xmath111 .",
    "this value , slightly higher than the expected ron on a sphere - like system , is chosen to strengthen the impact of the hyperparameter value .",

    "a reconstruction error value is computed for each value of @xmath114 .",
    "figure [ fig_regul ] shows that the analytic value of the hyperparameter ( @xmath115 ) is the one that gives the smallest reconstruction error for both upstream and downstream aberrations .",
    "when the regularization metrics are under balanced ( @xmath116 ) , the prior information is not `` strong '' enough in the minimization to prevent noise propagation in the estimated aberrations .",
    "one can notice here that without a regularization metric ( @xmath117 ) , the reconstruction error would have been unacceptable .",
    "on the other hand , when the regularization metrics are over balanced ( @xmath118 , their impact is too strong , and prevents the estimation of the high frequency components of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the following , considering the result of this simulation , all the estimations performed by coffee",
    "will be done using the analytic value of the hyperparameter ( @xmath115 ) .    in fig .",

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the result of this compensation after @xmath120 iterations of the loop is presented in fig . [ fig_dh ] ( the average computation time for one loop iteration is @xmath121 minutes ) . in the targeted area ( between @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) , this method allows a significant improvement : when the compensation is performed by conventional phase conjugation ( figure [ fig_conjphi ] ) , the average contrast in the same area is @xmath124 .",
    "the use of our new compensation method allow a contrast improvement by a factor @xmath125 after compensation ( figure [ fig_dh ] , bottom left ) .",
    "besides , the interest of the myopic approach is illustrated in fig . [ fig_dh ] : when the closed loop process is performed without estimation of an error on the diversity phase , the performance decreases by a factor @xmath126 ( solid cyan line ) .",
    "if a very high contrast level is required , this compensation technique can thus be used instead of conventional phase conjugation to calibrate the instrument . besides , in order to push down the dark hole floor , it is possible to narrow the energy minimization area , as mentioned by bord _",
    "in this paper , an extended version of our coronagraphic phase diversity , nicknamed coffee , has been presented .",
    "the use of a regularized pixel basis in the estimation allows coffee to estimate high order aberrations with nanometric precision ( section [ est ] ) . besides , thanks to a modification of the coronagraphic psf used in the imaging model , coffee is no longer limited to a particular coronagraphic device .",
    "coffee s performance has been studied and discussed in section [ perf ] , while section [ myop ] has described a so - called myopic extension of coffee , which consists in a joint estimation of an error on the diversity phase in order to improve coffee s accuracy in a real system , where the diversity phase is not perfectly known .",
    "lastly , in section [ comp ] , the achievable contrast optimization on a sphere - like system using coffee in a compensation process has been studied using realistic simulations . in the latter section ,",
    "we have presented a new compensation method which minimizes the energy in a chosen area of the detector through a non - linear minimization , in order to reach higher level of contrast than those that can be obtained using phase conjugation .",

    "several perspectives are currently considered for this work . with an adaptation of the coronagraphic imaging model",
