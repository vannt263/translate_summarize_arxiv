    "nemo  3 is a currently running experiment located in the laboratoire souterrain de modane ( lsm ) searching for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this decay is a uniquely sensitive probe of the mass and charge conjugation properties of the neutrino .",
    "should it be observed , it would demonstrate that at least one neutrino is a massive majorana particle .",
    "nemo  3 is also able to detect the rare second order weak double beta decay with its two accompanying neutrinos ( @xmath1 ) , as well as the non - standard neutrinoless decay with majoron emission ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the three decay modes are distinguishable experimentally by the energy sum distribution of the two beta particles .",
    "although the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay is the goal of nemo  3 , its aim is also to measure ( or give limits on ) half - lives of the other double beta decay processes .    the nemo  3 detector provides the direct detection of two electrons from the decay by the use of a tracking device and a calorimeter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nemo3 ] ) .",
    "it has three integrated components :    - a foil consisting of different sources of double beta emitters \\{@xmath3mo ( 6914  g ) , @xmath4se ( 932  g ) , @xmath5cd ( 405  g ) , @xmath6te ( 454  g ) , natural te ( 614  g of teo@xmath7 ) , @xmath8nd ( 37  g ) , @xmath9zr ( 9  g ) , @xmath10ca ( 7  g ) } and pure copper ( 621  g ) ;    - a tracking volume based on open geiger cells ;    - a calorimeter made of plastic scintillator blocks with photomultiplier tubes .",
    "a magnetic field created by a solenoidal coil surrounding the detector provides identification of electrons by the curvature of their tracks . besides the electron and photon identification , the calorimeter measures the energy and the arrival time of these particles while the tracking chamber can measure the time of delayed tracks associated with the initial event for up to 700  @xmath11s .",
    "a full description of the nemo  3 detector and its performance can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the first results were published in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most significant concern in double beta decay experiments is the background .",
    "although the candidates for double beta decay are selected as events with two electron ( 2@xmath12 ) tracks with a common origin on the source foil , there are certain non @xmath13 processes that can mimic the 2@xmath12 topology . according to its origin ,",
    "the background in nemo  3 is divided into two categories :    - the `` internal background '' having its origin inside the double beta decay source foil ;    - the `` external background '' coming from all radioactive sources located outside of the foil .",
    "the `` internal background '' is mainly due to the presence of radioactive isotopes from the @xmath14u and @xmath15th decay chains .",
    "the dominant mechanisms leading to the 2@xmath12 topology are ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bdf_int ] ) :    - @xmath16 decay accompanied by an internal conversion ;    - @xmath16 decay followed by mller scattering ;    - @xmath16-@xmath17 cascades in which a @xmath17-ray undergoes compton scattering .",
    "the first mechanism is the dominant one .",
    "particularly troublesome are the isotopes with large @xmath18 values such as @xmath19tl ( @xmath18=4.99  mev ) and @xmath20bi ( @xmath18=3.27  mev ) .",
    "fortunately , for these isotopes there are good estimates of the activities obtained from identifiable topologies ( @xmath21 for @xmath20bi , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath19tl ) .",
    "great care was taken in the production and subsequent purification of the enriched materials , as well as during the source foil production and the mounting of foils in the detector so as to keep any contamination to a minimum given the strict radioactivity limits .    in the region where a signal of neutrinoless @xmath13 decay is expected , the allowed @xmath1 decay can be an important fraction of the background .",
    "its contribution depends upon the @xmath1 half - life and the energy resolution of the detector .",
    "it is therefore important to carefully study the background in a large energy region where the @xmath1 decay takes place in order to obtain a good measurement of the half - life of this process .",
    "a component of the external background producing events similar to the internal background is caused by the presence of radon and thoron inside the detector .",
    "these elements are highly diffusive radioactive gases .",
    "they are outgased in the air from the rock walls of the experimental hall and can enter the detector either through tiny gaps between sectors or through gas pipe joints .",
    "the progeny of radon and thoron produces @xmath17-rays and @xmath16-decays accompanied by internal conversion ( ic ) , mller or compton scattering . if such an event occurs on or near a foil and appears with a 2@xmath12 topology it becomes indistinguishable from a double beta decay candidate .",
    "another component of this background is due to external @xmath17-rays interacting inside the foil .",
    "these @xmath17-rays are of different origins :    - @xmath17-rays inside the laboratory , mostly coming from the rock walls ;    - neutron interactions in the shield and material of the detector ;    - radioactive isotopes present in the detector materials despite the rigorous selection done during the detector construction ;    - presence of radon in the air surrounding the detector .",
    "the interaction of @xmath17-rays in the foil can appear like 2@xmath12 events by @xmath24 pair creation with misidentification of the charge , double compton scattering or compton scattering followed by mller scattering ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bdf_ext ] ) .    in this article",
    "the methods used to evaluate the various backgrounds are presented .",
    "the very pure copper foils ( ofhc ) are used to prove their validity .",
    "the experimental data of the nemo  3 detector were used to perform the background measurements .",
    "the most bothersome external background comes from radon .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : u238scheme ] , @xmath26bi is one of the descendents of @xmath25rn .",
    "the @xmath27decay of to @xmath26po is generally accompanied by several photons which can mimic a @xmath0 event given its large @xmath18 value .",
    "the @xmath26po has a half - life of 164  @xmath11s and it disintegrates to @xmath28pb via @xmath29-decay .",
    "the ejected alpha particle from the decay of @xmath25rn can free several electrons from the @xmath30po atom transforming it to a positively charged ion . diffusing through the gas of the tracking chamber this ion",
    "may be neutralized by different processes , such as recombining with negative ions in the gas , a charge transfer by neutral molecules with a small ionization potential or the capture of an electron created during the gas discharge near the open geiger cell wires  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to predict the proportions of neutral and charged atoms of @xmath30po in the gas of the nemo  3 tracking chamber .",
    "however , following some earlier studies  @xcite one can suppose that the proportion of neutral atoms of @xmath30po which are in the gas is small and that the majority of the charged @xmath30po is deposited on the surfaces of the cathode wires of the geiger cells . here",
    "the measurement of the radon activity in the tracking chamber is done under the assumption that the descendents of @xmath25rn are deposited on the wires .",
    "it should be noted that the final background resulting from the presence of @xmath25rn does not depend critically upon this assumption . if one supposes that the descendants of this gas are uniformly distributed in the tracking chamber the background estimation remains unchanched within the errors . a possible deposition on the foil surfaces is also taken into account in the analysis performed to measure internal foil contamination by @xmath26bi ( see section  [ sect : inbg ] ) .",
    "in the nemo  3 experiment , the data acquisition allows one to readout signals from delayed tracks in order to tag the @xmath29 particles from @xmath26po decays associated with electrons from @xmath26bi decays .",
    "the @xmath26bi decays followed by @xmath26po decays ( hereafter referred to as bipo events ) are used for the measurement of the radon activity .",
    "typical examples of such events with detected electron and @xmath29-particle tracks are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ev_examples ] .",
    "two types of spurious events can appear in a sample of bipo candidates .",
    "they are due to :    * random coincidence of two independent events closely localized in space and occurring inside the 700  @xmath11s time window .",
    "the delay time distribution is flat in this case . *",
    "a single event accompanied by one or more delayed signals caused by refiring of neighbouring geiger cells .",
    "the number of this kind of event decreases sharply with the delay time , so their distribution is nearly exponential .    in order to reduce the contribution from refirings , the following cuts are applied :    * for events with only one delayed signal , the delay must be greater than 90  @xmath11s ; * for events with more than one delayed signal , the delay must be greater than 30  @xmath11s .",
    "it is required that the delayed signals have to be located close to the `` prompt '' ( i.e. electron ) track or to the event vertex on the source foil .",
    "the group of selected delayed signals must be within 2.1  @xmath11s ( corresponding to the maximum transversal drift time in the geiger cells ) and follow a straight line in space in order to exclude random coincidences of delayed events of different origins . in the tracking chamber",
    "the maximum range of the 7.7  mev @xmath29-particle emitted by @xmath26po is 36 cm .",
    "this value is also taken into account in the selection of events .    applying these criteria",
    "the mean efficiency to select a bipo event produced on a wire surface has been estimated by a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to be 16.5% . in this work",
    "all simulations  @xcite are based on geant3  @xcite using decay0  @xcite as event generator .",
    "the time distribution of the delayed tracks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : time_alpha ] ) provides an efficient way to validate the quality of the event selection .",
    "the fit to the distributions allows the half - life of @xmath26po to be evaluated .",
    "the proportions of events due to refirings and random coincidences are also determined from the fit .",
    "they are found to be negligibly small with 0.6@xmath311.3% for the single delayed signal and 1.9@xmath310.8% for the multiple delayed signals as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_alpha ] . in spite of the systematic uncertainty of @xmath321  @xmath11s on the result , the half - life of @xmath26po for the single delayed signal events is @xmath33(@xmath26po ) = 162.9@xmath310.2(stat.only )  @xmath11s and for",
