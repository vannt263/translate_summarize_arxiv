    "let us begin by briefly recalling nielsen reduction for an automorphism of a free group @xmath1 on @xmath2 free generators @xmath3 .",
    "an _ elementary nielsen transformation _ with respect to these generators is an automorphism of @xmath1 given by either permuting two generators : @xmath4 , inverting some generator : @xmath5 , or multiplying some generator by another : @xmath6 for @xmath7 . _",
    "nielsen reduction _ is an algorithm which applies basic cancellation theory to decomposes every @xmath8 into a product of these elementary transformations @xcite .",
    "roughly , the algorithm proceeds by continuously applying elementary transformations which reduce the total word length of the generating set @xmath9 with respect to the @xmath10 s whenever possible , with the final goal of obtaining @xmath3 . in the event that no length - reducing transformation is available , a lexicographical ordering of @xmath1",
    "is used to ensure progress is made towards this final goal .",
    "let @xmath0 be a surface of genus @xmath11 with one boundary component , and let @xmath12 be its fundamental group with respect to a basepoint @xmath13 on the boundary .",
    "the mapping class group @xmath14 of @xmath0 acts on @xmath15 and can be identified with the subgroup of @xmath16 which preserves the element @xmath17 representing the boundary @xcite .",
    "since @xmath18 is a free group , every mapping class @xmath19 can be decomposed via nielsen reduction ; however , this decomposition has no obvious topological interpretation .    in this short survey",
    ", we will discuss a variation of the above algorithm for mapping classes called fatgraph nielsen reduction which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm has a simple topological interpretation in terms of polygon domains of @xmath0 ( see the next section ) and in fact produces a sequence of elementary moves , called cs moves , relating any two polygon domains of @xmath0 , not only those differing by the action of a mapping class .    motivated by this application to nielsen reduction , we introduce the _ chord slide groupoid _ @xmath20 , the groupoid naturally generated by cs moves , which can be thought of as a groupoid laying somewhere `` between '' the mapping class group @xmath14 and the full automorphism group @xmath16 ( as discussed at the end of section [ sect : cs ] ) .",
    "this survey essentially summarizes the results of @xcite and @xcite , as well as some results of @xcite .",
    "however , the perspective taken here is different in that we do not emphasize the use of fatgraphs and chord diagrams , but rather choose to focus on the dual notions of triangulations and polygon domains of @xmath0 . in some ways",
    ", this perspective is the most natural and classical , and hopefully this will allow for these results to be accessible to a wider audience .",
    "instead of considering all generating sets of @xmath15 , let us consider only those which can be topologically realized by @xmath21 disjoint arcs in @xmath22 based at @xmath23 .",
    "we will call such a set a cg set and consider two cg sets equivalent if they are realized by the same collection of arcs . cutting along",
    "any such collection @xmath24 of arcs decomposes @xmath22 into a polygon @xmath25 with @xmath26 edges labelled by @xmath15 ( see below ) , @xmath27 of which are identified in pairs .",
    "we call this a _ polygon domain _ of @xmath0 , and there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between ( equivalence classes of ) cg sets and polygon domains of @xmath22 .",
    "when a particular polygon domain is assumed , we shall denote its oriented sides by @xmath28 , where the ordering and orientation is given by the clockwise cyclic ordering of @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "see figure [ fig : fan ] .",
    "we shall often abuse notation and confuse an oriented side of @xmath31 with the corresponding oriented arc of a cg set or generator in @xmath15 , so that we will often simply write @xmath32 .",
    "an immediate observation is that for any polygon @xmath31 decomposition of @xmath0 with sides @xmath28 , we have @xmath33 where again we consider the boundary @xmath17 as an element of @xmath15 and we use a bar to denote an inverse in @xmath15 or the reversal of an orientation of an arc .",
    "as each arc of a cg set @xmath34 corresponds to two oriented sides of @xmath35 , we can ( and will ) canonically orient and order the arcs of @xmath34 according to their first appearance in @xmath29 . as a familiar example ,",
    "a symplectic generating set @xmath36 with @xmath37=\\partial s_{g,1}$ ] defines a polygon domain of @xmath0 with sides @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , etc .",
    ", identified in the `` standard '' way .",
    "recall that a groupoid can be described as a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism .",
    "we define the _ chord slide groupoid _ , denoted @xmath20 , to be the groupoid whose objects are copies of @xmath15 , one for every equivalence class of cg set , and whose morphisms are the automorphisms of @xmath15 provided by taking one ( canonically ordered ) cg set to another . in this way",
    ", we have a groupoid morphism ( functor ) @xmath41 which is neither 1-to-1 nor onto ( neither faithful nor full ) , but does have trivial kernel .    by the fundamental result of decorated teichmller theory , it is known that @xmath20 is equivalent to a trivial groupoid , as it represents a discrete version of the fundamental path groupoid of a contractible space , the so - called decorated teichmller space of @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) . in other words , there is a unique morphism between any two objects of @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the mapping class group @xmath14 acts freely on the chord slide groupoid via its action on ( isotopy classes of ) collections of arcs .",
    "thus , the quotient @xmath42 is a groupoid equivalent ( as a groupoid ) to the mapping class group @xmath14 itself .",
    "the advantage of the groupoid viewpoint presented here is that the generators and relations can be stated quite simply , as we shall see .",
    "as the source and target of every morphism of @xmath20 both correspond to a particular generating set for @xmath15 , it makes sense to ask when a morphism of @xmath20 is an elementary nielsen transformation .",
    "instead , let us ask the related question , when a morphism is a product of elementary transformations involving only one multiplication , so that up to permutation we have @xmath43    @xmath44    it is easy to see when the answer to this new question is `` yes '' .",
    "it is exactly when a morphism is between cg sets which differ by the exchange of a single generator such that the corresponding polygon domains @xmath45 and @xmath46 are related by cutting a triangle off of @xmath45 and reattaching it to another side of @xmath45 ( according to the identification of sides of @xmath45 ) .",
    "see figure [ fig : cutslide ] where we depict the transformation @xmath47 .",
    "we call such a move a _ triangle cut - slide move _ , or simply a cs move for short .",
    "it is not hard to see that a more general cut - slide move , where we cut off a larger polygon from @xmath45 and reattach it to another side , can be decomposed into triangle cut - slide moves .",
    "in fact , we shall soon see that cs moves generate all of @xmath20 , but first we return to the topic of nielsen reduction .",
    "we now adapt nielsen reduction to the case of polygon domains of @xmath0 , with cs moves taking the place of elementary nielsen transformations . for this",
    ", it will be convenient to fix a particular symplectic generating set @xmath48 to serve as our `` basepoint '' in @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the corresponding polygon domain of @xmath0 , and let us denote its ( ordered ) sides by @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 , etc . now consider any other cg set with polygon domain @xmath31 and sides @xmath28 .",
    "our goal is to find a sequence of cs moves which will transform @xmath52 to @xmath53 . as with classical nielsen reduction ,",
    "we first concentrate on word length and define the _ length _ of @xmath31 by @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the word length of @xmath56 with respect to the letters @xmath53 .",
    "we call a side @xmath57 of @xmath31 _ unbalanced _ if more than half of it cancels with one of its neighbors , meaning either @xmath58 and @xmath59 as reduced words with @xmath60 , or @xmath61 and @xmath62 as reduced words with @xmath63 .",
    "it is immediate that if @xmath57 is unbalanced , a cs move involving @xmath57 can reduce the word length of @xmath31 . as @xmath64 if and only if @xmath65 ( due to the restriction ) , if we were always able to find an unbalanced side of @xmath31 , we would have our algorithm for evolving @xmath31 into @xmath66 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not always do this ; however , we will always be able to find a cs move which makes progress towards @xmath66 and is non - increasing in length .",
    "we say that @xmath57 is balanced if @xmath67 , @xmath61 , and @xmath59 as a reduced words with @xmath68 , so that @xmath57 cancels equal amounts to the left and to the right .",
    "our choice of cg set @xmath69 was motivated by the following fact ( which we conjecture to be true for any cg set ) , whose proof we leave to the interested reader .    if @xmath31 has no unbalanced or balanced side , then @xmath65 .",
    "now , to make use of the above lemma , we need to introduce an _ energy function _ which lexicographically orders @xmath15 .",
    "we define the _ energy _ @xmath70 of an element @xmath56 by @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 as a reduced word .",
    "note that this indeed defines a lexicographical ordering on @xmath15 and that it extends the word length function in that @xmath75 implies @xmath76 .",
    "we similarly define the energy of a polygon domain by @xmath77    if @xmath57 is a balanced side of @xmath31 , then a triangle cut - slide move involving @xmath57 reduces the energy @xmath78 of @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath61 , and @xmath79 .",
    "if we cut off the triangle @xmath80 defined by @xmath57 and @xmath81 and reattach it to the side @xmath82 , then the cg set is changed by @xmath83 ( and thus also @xmath84 ) .",
    "similarly , if we cut off @xmath85 and attach it to @xmath86 , then we have @xmath87 ( and also @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus it is not hard to see that if @xmath76 , then the first cut - slide move reduces the energy , while if @xmath89 then the second one does .",
    "as one of these two inequalities must hold , we have our result .    collecting the above lemmas",
    ", we are able to describe our `` fatgraph '' nielsen reduction algorithm : whenever possible , reduce the word length of @xmath31 by a cs move involving an unbalanced side .",
    "when no unbalanced side exists , perform a cs move on a balanced side to reduce the energy .",
    "recall that a groupoid can also be defined as a partially composable set with inverses .",
    "viewing @xmath20 in this way , we see that a consequence of the fatgraph nielsen reduction is the following lemma :    [ lem : gen ] triangle cut - slide moves generate @xmath20 .    in this section",
    ", we shall give an alternative proof of this , as well as a description of the relations of @xmath20 . to this end , we begin by noting that any polygon domain @xmath31 of @xmath0 can be canonically extended to a triangulation @xmath90 of @xmath0 ( based at @xmath23 ) by triangulating the polygon in a fan - like fashion as depicted in figure [ fig : fan]a .",
    "@xmath91    conversely , an inverse to this fan - like triangulation is given by the following greedy algorithm @xcite : given a triangulation @xmath92 of @xmath0 based at @xmath23 , we canonically order the arcs of @xmath92 according to their first appearance in the clockwise ordering at @xmath23 ( see figure [ fig : fan]b ) . in this ordering , we consecutively remove every arc from this collection as long as the compliment of the remaining arcs in @xmath0 consists of a union of polygons .",
    "this is clearly an inverse of the fan - like triangulation .",
    "moreover , we have the following `` locality '' result :    [ lem : locality ] given an arc @xmath93 in a triangulation @xmath92 , let @xmath94 be the triangle lying to the right of @xmath95 at its first occurrence in the ordering of arcs at @xmath23 ( see figure [ fig : fan]b ) , and let @xmath96 be the sector of @xmath94 opposite to @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath93 is removed during the greedy algorithm if and only if @xmath96 precedes @xmath93 in the clockwise order at @xmath23 .    whenever an arc is removed during the greedy algorithm , its complement in @xmath0 changes by attaching a triangle to the current polygon containing @xmath97 as a side .",
    "this can happen for @xmath93 if and only if @xmath96 does not precede @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath98     we are now ready to give our alternate proof of lemma [ lem : gen ] .",
    "the proof relies on the classical result of whitehead which states that any two triangulations of @xmath0 are related by a sequence of elementary diagonal exchanges ( see figure [ fig : diagx]a ) , where an arc is removed and replaced by the opposite diagonal in the resulting quadrilateral .",
    "note that a triangle cut - slide move can be realized by ( usually ) two or ( sometimes ) one diagonal exchange on the corresponding fan - like triangulation of @xmath0 .",
    "we essentially need to show the converse .",
    "given any two polygon domains @xmath31 and @xmath99 of @xmath0 , we can canonically triangulate each to obtain triangulations @xmath92 and @xmath100 . by whitehead",
    "s result , @xmath92 and @xmath100 are related by a sequence of diagonal exchanges : @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the @xmath103th polygon domain corresponding to @xmath104 via the greedy algorithm so that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "lemma [ lem : locality ] can be interpreted as saying the inclusion of an arc in @xmath104 as a side of @xmath107 is a `` local '' property ; thus , as @xmath108 differs from @xmath109 by the replacement of a single arc , @xmath110 can differ from @xmath107 only by the replacement of a single arc .",
    "as we have already noted , such a move can be realized by a sequence of cs moves ; thus , we have our result .",
    "once we know how to generate @xmath20 , it is natural to ask what relations the groupoid satisfies .",
    "some relations are immediate , such as following a cs move by its inverse , which reattaches the cut triangle to its original position .",
    "we call this the _ involutivity _ relation @xmath111 .",
    "similarly , cut - slide moves for non - adjacent triangles ( which remain non - adjacent after sliding ) are easily seen to commute with each other , and we call this the _ commutativity _ relation @xmath112 . also , it is not hard to see that we have the following _ triangle _ relation @xmath92 where a triangle @xmath113 with sides @xmath114 and @xmath115 is cut off and attached to @xmath116 , then cut off again and attached to @xmath117 , then cut off again and reattached in its original position .",
    "@xmath118{l1.eps}\\end{array } } { \\rightarrow}{\\begin{array}{c}\\vspace{-.05in}\\includegraphics[width=0.93in]{l25.eps}\\end{array } } { \\rightarrow}{\\begin{array}{c}\\vspace{-.05in}\\includegraphics[width=0.93in]{l3.eps}\\end{array } } { \\rightarrow}{\\begin{array}{c}\\vspace{-.05in}\\includegraphics[width=0.93in]{l4.eps}\\end{array}}\\ ] ]    finally , we have two relations which involve cutting and sliding two adjacent triangles . the _ left pentagon _",
    "relation @xmath119 is depicted in figure [ fig : l ] .",
    "right pentagon _",
    "@xmath120 is defined analogously .",
    "@xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath92 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 generate all relations in @xmath20 .",

    "it relies on the results of decorated teichmller theory @xcite which tell us precisely what the relations are for the analogous groupoid generated by diagonal exchanges , the so - called _ ptolemy groupoid _",
    "@xmath122 @xcite .",
    "all relations in @xmath122 are generated by three types of relations : the obvious involutivity relation where a diagonal exchange is followed by its inverse , the commutativity relation involving diagonal exchanges on non - adjacent arcs , and the famous _ pentagon relation _ which is depicted in figure [ fig : pentagon ] .",
    "the proof then proceeds by doing a careful analysis between diagonal exchanges and cut - slide moves via the greedy algorithm to rewrite ( the image under the greedy algorithm of ) each possible incarnation of a relation in @xmath122 as a product of the relations @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath92 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "while we have so far focused on the perspective of arc systems and polygon domains , there is a dual perspective which is worth briefly mentioning ( and in fact is the perspective taken in @xcite ) . given any ( non - degenerate ) arc system @xmath123 based at @xmath23 which cuts @xmath0 into a number of polygon components , we define the poincar dual graph @xmath124 of @xmath125 to be the graph embedded in @xmath0 which has one vertex for every component of @xmath126 and one edge @xmath127 for every arc @xmath128 of @xmath125 such that @xmath127 intersects @xmath129 if and only if @xmath130 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath92 is a triangulation , @xmath131 is a trivalent graph , and if @xmath132 is a cg set , @xmath133 is a `` rose '' graph with only one vertex .",
    "note that every oriented edge of the graph @xmath124 is colored by an element of @xmath15 in a natural way ( after choosing an orientation of @xmath0 ) .",
    "in fact , this dual graph inherits some additional structure , as the orientation of the surface induces a cyclic ordering of half - edges incident to every vertex .",
    "we call such a vertex - oriented graph a _ fatgraph_. it is convenient ( for technical reasons ) to consider the boundary @xmath97 to be an arc included in every arc system , in which case poincar duality will produce _ bordered fatgraphs _ : fatgraphs with a special edge called the _ tail _",
    "whose univalent endpoint lies on the boundary @xmath134 .",
    "( see figure [ fig : chordslide ] . )",
    "we are primarily interested in trivalent bordered fatgraphs which are dual to triangulations of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the graph we obtain as the dual of a fan - like triangulation of a polygon domain takes the form of a _ linear chord diagram_. a linear chord diagram is a trivalent graph immersed in the plane consisting of a segment of the real axis called the _ core _ , together with line segments lying in the upper half - plane called the _ chords _ which are attached to distinct points of the core . under this duality ,",
    "the chords of a linear chord diagram embedded in @xmath0 exactly correspond to pairs of identified sides of a polygon domain of @xmath0 , and the structure of the chord diagram essentially captures the information of how these sides are identified .",
    "we now depict how the elementary moves of arc systems look in this dual viewpoint .",
    "firstly , a diagonal exchange on a triangulation corresponds to a _",
    "whitehead move _ on a trivalent bordered fatgraph , which is a move where one non - tail edge is collapsed to a four - valent vertex and then expanded in the opposite direction .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a triangle cs move , on the other hand , corresponds to a _",
    "chord slide _ ( thus , finally explaining the name of the chord slide groupoid ) on a linear chord diagram , which is a move where one endpoint of a chord is slid along a neighboring chord to a new position on the core , as depicted in figure [ fig : chordslide ] . during both of these moves , @xmath15-colorings of the edges of these graphs evolve in natural ways , according to certain `` vertex compatibility '' relations .",
    "see @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we finish by listing diagrammatically the @xmath92 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 relations for linear chord diagrams , where the thin lines represent chords and the thick lines represent segments of the core ."
