    "hence , @xmath9 has a homothetic symmetry , @xmath10    to appreciate this result , we need several distinct pieces of background , namely , various results from @xmath11 geometry , and more generally the ambient construction in conformal geometry , as well as various asymptotic limits of braneworlds .",
    "witten in his work [ ] gives various proofs and implications of the following basic result : the @xmath12dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath13 is the boundary of @xmath14 .",
    "basically one may proceed from the poincar metric @xmath15 , to a new metric @xmath16 , and then restrict @xmath17 to finally get a conformal structure on the boundary spacetime .",
    "we now consider the _ inverse problem _ : starting from a conformal space - time manifold @xmath0)$ ] , is there a metric on @xmath4 such that when we perform the construction we get the given conformal structure that we started with ?",
    "this is the problem that occupied the fundamental work ref .",
    ", concerned with the construction of conformal invariants .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that there exists a well - defined _ ambient metric _ ( this is the fefferman - graham metric ) @xmath2 on @xmath18 ( points @xmath19 ) with the following properties ( cf .",
    "ref .  ):",
    "* locally around @xmath20 in @xmath18 , there is a smooth ( non - unique ) function @xmath21 with @xmath22 on @xmath4 , @xmath23 on @xmath5 , and such that @xmath24 extends smoothly on @xmath4 .",
    "* @xmath25 is non - degenerate on @xmath5 ( that is its signature remains @xmath26 on @xmath5 ) .",
    "* @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "( @xmath5 is the conformal infinity of @xmath4 . ) * @xmath2 satisfies the einstein equations with a cosmological constant @xmath28 to infinite order on @xmath5 .",
    "* @xmath2 is in normal form with respect to @xmath29:@xmath30 here , @xmath31 stands for a suitable formal power series with @xmath32 .",
    "( we may also use @xmath33 as @xmath21 . ) * @xmath2 is unique : given any two ambient metrics @xmath34 for @xmath0)$ ] , their difference @xmath35 vanishes to infinite order everywhere along @xmath36 .",
    "it is possible use these results in order to reveal certain drawbacks of braneworld geometry , especially important in questions of an asymptotic nature . we know how to obtain a complete profile of all asymptotic situations that emerge when we have a bulk 5-geometry @xmath37 containing an embedded 4-dimensional braneworld @xmath38 that is either a 4-dimensional minkowski , or de sitter , or anti - de sitter spacetime , cf .",
    "in general , all asymptotic solutions have a form dictated by the method of asymptotic splittings [ ] . from these results , it is not difficult to conclude that the following properties apply in fact to a great variety of different models of braneworlds ( cf .",
    "e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] - [ ] and refs . therein ) :    * the properties of the metric @xmath29 do not follow from those of the bulk metric @xmath39 but are dictated by field equations valid on the 4-`brane ' itself .",
    "* there is no conformal infinity for the 5-dimensional geometry ( the brane is certainly a kind of boundary to the bulk , but it can never be a _ conformal _",
    "boundary ) . *",
    "no holographic interpretation is possible and there is no way to realize a boundary cft .    in what follows , we present a novel approach in which all of the above difficulties are absent . for more details and developments ,",
    "the reader is advised to look at refs .",
    "in this section , we present a brief summary of the main points of our construction to produce a situation where generic spacetimes will end up having improved properties over those we may meet in the theory of hypersurfaces in general relativity ( or in its higher - dimensional extensions as above ) . in the proposal below , a new bounding hypersurface ,",
    "the conformal infinity of a new cosmological metric in 5-dimensional ` ambient ' space will be the result .",
    "our construction is generally one belonging to conformal geometry ( cf .",
    "[ ] ) , and may be summarized as follows ( cf .",
    "[ ] for more discussion and complete proofs ) .    1 .",
    "take a 4-dimensional , non - degenerate ` initial ' metric @xmath40 on spacetime @xmath5 .",
    "this step essentially involves the penrose conformal method .",
    "conformally deform @xmath41 to a new metric @xmath42 by choosing a suitable conformal factor @xmath21 .",
    "this step connects the ` bad ' metric @xmath41 with the ` nice ' , non - degenerate , and non - singular metric @xmath43 .",
    "3 .   using the method of asymptotic splittings for the 5-dimensional einstein equations with an arbitrary ( with respect to the fluid parameter @xmath44 ) fluid , solve for the 5-dimensional metric @xmath45 and the matter density @xmath46 .",
    "4 .   transform the solutions of step 3 to suitable factored forms of the general type , ( divegent part ) @xmath47 ( smooth part ) .",
    "5 .   construct the ` ambient ' metric in normal form , @xmath2 , for the 5-dimensional einstein equations with a fluid .",
    "this is given by the following form , @xmath48 @xmath49 , as @xmath50 , with @xmath51 a smooth ( infinitely differentiable ) function such that @xmath52 is a nonzero constant .",
    "@xmath0)$ ] is the conformal infinity of @xmath53 , that is @xmath54 .",
    "the metric @xmath2 is conformally compact .",
    "this means that a suitable metric @xmath55 constructed from @xmath2 extends smoothly to @xmath4 , and its restriction to @xmath5 , @xmath56 , is non - degenerate ( i.e. , maintains the same signature also on @xmath5 ) .",
    "the conformal infinity @xmath5 of the ambient metric @xmath2 of any metric in the conformal class @xmath57 $ ] is controlled by the behaviour of a constant rescaling of the ` nice ' metric @xmath29 .",
    "however , uniqueness of the ambient cosmological metric is not achieved like in the fefferman - graham construction [ ] .",
    "instead , we find [ ] an _ asymptotic condition _",
    "valid on the conformal infinity of the ambient space after taking suitable limits of the various possible geometric asymptotics of the problem .",
    "this method lies in the heart of the whole construction , and is treated briefly below .",
    "for any two conformally related 4-metrics @xmath58 in the conformal geometry of @xmath5 , @xmath59 being the ` good ' ( roughly meaning ` regular ' ) and @xmath60 the ` bad ' metric on the boundary , their ambient metrics @xmath61 differ by a homothetic transformation , [ asymptotic ] _ 2|_m(0)=c_1|_m(0),c :    conclusion : starting from a conformal geometry on the spacetime @xmath5 , the ambient cosmological metric returns a 4-geometry on @xmath5 ( its conformal infinity metric @xmath56 ) that has a homothetic symmetry .",
    "according to our proposal , our 4-dimensional world is the conformal infinity of the ambient 5-space discussed above .",
    "what are the basic implications of this proposal ?",
    "we may summarize two of them as follows .    1 .",
    "[ 1 ] as a conformal manifold , @xmath0)$ ] can have no singularities .",
    "2 .   cosmic censorship on @xmath0)$ ]",
    "is equivalent to the validity of ambient 5-metric construction , the asymptotic condition satisfied by the ambient metric @xmath56 .",
    "one notion that plays a key role in many theorems in global causal structure and the singularity thorems in general relativity is the convergence of a sequence of causal curves .",
    "looking carefully at the proofs of various such results , we note the following ( cf . [ ] for a more complete discussion of this ) .    * for the convergence of a sequence of causal curves to a limit curve , one uses in an essential way the euclidean balls with their euclidean metric and their compactness in order to extract the necessary limits . *",
    "since the zeeman topology , unique for the conformal boundary , is strictly finer than the euclidean metric topology , such sequences will be zeno sequences and their convergence in the euclidean topology will not guarantee the existence of a limit curve in the zeeman topology .",
    "* in the proofs of the singularity theorems , a contradiction appears when assuming the existence of a curve of length greater than some maximum starting from a spacelike cauchy surface @xmath62 ( on which the mean curvature is negative ) downwards to the past .",
    "* one extracts a limit curve @xmath44 ( which locally maximizes the length between @xmath62 and an event @xmath63 ) , and no curve can have length greater than that of @xmath44 . * here we can not extract such a limit .    this result and more elaborate work [ ] along these lines , opens the way for the construction of complete spacetimes as the conformal infinities of physical theories in higher dimensional ambient space .",
