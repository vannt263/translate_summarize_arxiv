    "it has been widely speculated that the energy that heats the corona comes from the convective flows in the photosphere .",
    "the energy is somehow transported into the coronal part through the magnetic field .",
    "it is natural to think that alfvn waves channel the energy to the corona .",
    "indeed , these waves have been observed in the solar atmosphere ( ulrich 1996 ) , and are ubiquitous in the extended corona  the fast solar wind ( smith et al .",
    "however alfvn waves are difficult to dissipate in collisionless plasmas .",
    "hence , non - linear processes have been assumed to cascade the wave energy from low to high frequencies where wave dissipation is readily possible ( hollweg 1986 , li and habbal 2003 ) .",
    "when alfvn waves propagate in a partially ionized plasma , neutral - ion collisions produce a channel for the wave dissipation ( de pontieu & haerendel 1998 ; de pontieu et al .",
    "2001 ; leake et al . 2005 ) .",
    "ions and neutrals can be collisionally coupled .",
    "a slippage between the ion and neutral populations leads to the wave dissipation .",
    "if we consider neutrals are constantly ionized at the chromosphere , we will show that these newly created he@xmath4 ions will be picked - up by the wave and will be energized .    in this letter , a new scenario , ion pickup by an alfvn wave ,",
    "is explored .",
    "the pickup process can lead to the heating of ions , and it must also dissipate the wave . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the ion pickup process by an instantly introduced wave ( or identically , the ions are created instantly ) . in section 3 ,",
    "the pickup of continuously created ions by an alfvn wave is investigated .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss possible applications of the ion pickup process in the solar atmosphere .",

    "helium ions are dramatically scattered in the transverse direction in the phase space .",
    "the ring velocity distributions are nicely shown in fig.2 .",
    "the ring velocity distribution is unstable ( lu and wang 2005 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution may eventually be thermalized by relevant microscopic instabilities of the ring distribution .",
    "the bulk acceleration of particles along @xmath101 is obvious .",
    "this is because in the frame of the alfvn phase speed , the kinetic energy of particles is conserved .",
    "as particles are picked up by the wave , they gain a bulk acceleration along @xmath101 .",
    "in a partially ionized plasma , the creation of new ions due to photoionization or collisional ionization is highly random . consider a region with a low plasma beta and where the amplitude of an alfvn wave is finite .",
    "when ions are created from neutrals , they are subject to rapid gyromotions .",
    "the continuous creation of ions represents a continuous phase shift in the ion gyrospeed .",

    "a new test particle simulation is conducted .",
    "the alfvn wave and the simulation box are the same as in section 2 .",
    "however , 1000 particles are deployed every @xmath102 at @xmath103 ( one particle per cell ) .",
    "the beta value of the newly created he@xmath4 ions is 0.01 and they have zero flow speed .",
    "the results of the simulation are shown in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , which are plotted in the same way as figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "note that in the @xmath104 plane , because the radius of the ring ( fig.3 ) is @xmath105 , the origin , where new particles are created around there , is always on the ring .",
    "when new he@xmath4 ions are continuously created , the heating and scattering process are completed when they have filled the ring of radius @xmath105 in the @xmath106 plane .",
    "this only takes one gyroperiod of he@xmath4 ions , or when @xmath107 , as shown in fig.3 and 4 .",
    "hence the heating of these particles is extremely rapid .",
    "the ion creation process was terminated at time @xmath108 , however no change is observed as @xmath109 .",
    "we believe that the rapid heating due to alfvn waves reported by wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is due to their deployment of particles within one gyroperiod , even though they used many wave modes in their computations .",
    "the alfvn wave pickup of newly created ions may have applications at the top of the chromosphere or lower transition region .",
    "let s consider the region with an ion cyclotron frequency much higher than coulomb collision frequencies , low plasma beta and finite amplitude alfvn waves . for neutral helium , when wave frequencies are higher than the ion neutral collision frequencies , the perturbed ion and neutral velocity will have a considerable difference between their phases and amplitudes ( de pontieu & haerendel 1998 ) . in coronal funnels ,",
    "the plasma beta at the lower transition region is much smaller than unity ( li 2003 ) . for finite amplitude waves , the pickup process described above may operate and heat newly created he@xmath4 ions .",
    "due to collisions , the temperature is not expected to reach the value given by ( [ q13 ] ) . instead , the energy will be transferred to protons and electrons via coulomb coupling .",
    "obviously , the thermal energy of he@xmath4 gained through the pickup process will be passed to he@xmath110 later on when he@xmath110 are created . as the ionization continues to the transition region",
    "( hansteen et al . 1997 ) , the pickup process will contribute to the plasma heating there .",
    "the pickup of instantly created ions by an alfvn wave or the pickup of ions by an alfvn wave instantly introduced into a plasma is quite efficient even for low frequency waves in collisionless plasmas .",
    "the pickup process is complete when @xmath111 or @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the period of the wave .",
    "transverse oscillations of active region coronal loops that suddenly appear with periods of 2@xmath11433 minutes have been frequently observed by trace ( nakariakov et al .",
    "1999 ; aschwanden et al .",
    "the oscillations usually just last several wave periods .",
