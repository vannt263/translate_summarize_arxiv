    "de broglie s intuition that solid matter might be wave - like revealed a unity in nature that was to play a central role in the formulation of quantum mechanics ( de broglie @xcite to @xcite ) .",
    "it was this unity that allowed all particles , whether massive or massless , to be treated in like manner as evolving and interfering in accordance with associated wave characteristics .",
    "however , it will be argued here , essentially from a reconsideration of de broglie s thesis of 1924 @xcite , that the de broglie or matter wave is not the independent wave conventionally supposed , but the relativistically induced modulation of an underlying carrier wave that moves with the velocity of the particle .  in the rest frame of the particle , this underlying structure has the form of a standing wave .",
    "so regarded , the de broglie wave is not itself , strictly speaking , the matter wave of quantum mechanics , but evidences the existence of a deeper wave structure more deserving of that title .",
    "if , consistently with special relativity , this underlying structure were assumed to comprise influences evolving at the velocity @xmath2 of light , its existence would imply in turn a deeper and more natural unity between matter and radiation than could be contemplated if the only wave associated with a massive particle were its superluminal de broglie wave .",
    "this is not to question the significance of de broglie s wave or the importance to physics of his famous thesis .",
    "einstein remarked that de broglie had uncovered a corner of the great veil  @xcite , and it was from the thesis that schrdinger was led to wave mechanics .",
    "the schrdinger equation was itself conceived as a general equation for the de broglie wave ( see bloch @xcite , and bacciagaluppi and valentini @xcite , esp .",
    "chaps . 2 and 11 ) .",
    "yet the de broglie wave and the schrdinger wave function have seemed curious affairs .",
    "the de broglie wave is not only superluminal but strangely disassociated from the subluminal particle that it is forever overtaking but never outruns .  and",
    "despite the utility of the wave function , there has been much debate as to what it actually means .     in his report to the solvay conference of 1927 , schrdinger observed that  this @xmath3-function  seems to describe , not a single trajectory , but a snapshot .... with the camera shutter open  of all possible classical configurations ( see bacciagaluppi and valentini @xcite , p. 411 ) .  in standard quantum mechanics ,",
    "this superposition is intrinsically probabilistic , but that view has led to the measurement problem , as well illustrated by schrdinger s _ reductio ad absurdum _ of the unobserved cat that is at once dead and alive ( schrdinger @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has been assumed in quantum mechanics ,  both in its standard form and in its many reinterpretations , as it was by de broglie and schrdinger , that the de broglie wave is a wave in its own right .",
    "how the de broglie wave might arise instead from the lorentz transformation of an underlying standing wave may be explained shortly as follows .  the crests of a standing wave rise and fall as one , each simultaneously with the next ( as shown for a one - dimensional wave in fig .",
    "1(a)(i ) ) .  but according to special relativity , simultaneity is itself relative .  in an inertial frame in which the rest frame of the standing wave is moving ,",
    "the crests of the wave are observed to peak , not in unison , but in sequence .",
    "the standing wave suffers a dephasing - a failure of simultaneity - in the direction of travel ( as suggested by fig .",
    "1(a)(ii ) ) .",
    "this dephasing , moving through the underlying wave at superluminal velocity , is the de broglie wave , not a wave in its own right , but a modulation , or as it might be termed , a wave of simultaneity .  to an observer for whom",
    "the particle wave is moving at the velocity @xmath4 , the standing wave will have the character of a carrier wave moving at that same velocity @xmath4 , but subject to a modulation of velocity @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the speed of light in vacuum .",

    "the velocity of the wave is not only superluminal but increases as the particle slows and becomes infinite as the particle comes to rest .",
    "this is not the behaviour of any independent wave , not that at least of any energy - carrying independent wave , but is precisely the behaviour of the modulation of an underlying carrier wave .",
    "as we consider de broglie s thesis , it will become apparent not only that he too assumed the existence of this antecedent standing wave , but that in two of his three demonstrations of the de broglie wave , or as he then called it , the phase wave , this wave arises exactly as contended here .",
    "but in view of the tentative nature of his proposals , and as he explained in the conclusion to the thesis , he left intentionally vague  ( _ intentionnellement laiss assez vagues _ ) the definitions of these wave forms .  in the absence of a description of the antecedent standing wave",

    "it will be shown that this is not so .",
    "once the de broglie wave is identified as a modulation , its velocity becomes consistent with special relativity , avoiding the necessity of assimilating the velocity of the particle to the group velocity of a superposition of such waves .  with even greater significance for quantum mechanics , the schrdinger and other equations for massive particles , including the pauli , klein - gordon and dirac equations , which were all contrived from the wave characteristics of the de broglie wave ( see , for example dirac @xcite ) ,",

    "this might explain why the wave functions that emerge as solutions of these equations have seemed incapable of defining a trajectory for the particle in question .",
    "the existence of an underlying wave structure , moving at the velocity of the particle , might also shed light on such issues in quantum mechanics as the meaning of the wave function and the nature of wave - particle duality .",
    "de broglie s interpretation of his wave varied over time , but it was never the modulation proposed here .",
    "it was always a wave in its own right , or a superposition of such waves , as described in the thesis , and it is on the thesis that we now concentrate .",
    "it is also from the famous thesis , rather than  from de broglie s later writings , that it is possible to discern where and how the existence of the underlying carrier wave came to be overlooked .",
    "de broglie saw that if the planck - einstein relation , @xmath6for the photon were extended to matter and equated with einstein s statement , @xmath7of the equivalence of mass and energy , a massive particle could be associated in its rest frame with a characteristic frequency @xmath8 or , when expressed as an angular frequency , @xmath9where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the rest mass of the particle and the reduced planck constant ( de broglie @xcite , chap . 1 , sect i ) .",
    "de broglie rejected the possibility that this frequency could be the measure of some wholly internal oscillation .  observing that the energy of an electron spreads throughout all space",
    ", he argued that a massive particle must be surrounded in its rest frame by what he referred to as a periodic phenomenon .",
    "he clearly regarded this phenomenon as some form of standing wave .",
    "this is apparent from his modelling of the phenomenon as an assemblage of springs oscillating in unison ( see sect . 5 below ) and is explicit in his depiction of the wave in minkowski spacetime ( see sect . 6 below )",
    "he expressly described the phenomenon as a stationary or standing wave in his report to the solvay conference of 1927 ( see bacciagaluppi and valentini @xcite , p. 341 ) , as also in other works ( @xcite , and @xcite , chap .",
    "3 ) including his nobel lecture of 1929 @xcite .",
    "consistently with that description ,  he suggested elsewhere that in the rest frame of the particle the de broglie wave comprises a superposition of incoming and outgoing waves @xcite .",
    "but in the thesis itself , de broglie avoided saying much at all about this underlying structure .",
    "as mentioned above , this vagueness was intentional , the theory being , as he also said in  concluding the thesis , not entirely precise  ( _ nest pas entirement prcis _ ) .",
    "de broglie did state that the periodic phenomenon varies sinusoidally in time and that it is distributed throughout an extended region of space  ( de broglie @xcite , chap . 1",
    ", sect i ) .",
    "but there is no description in the thesis of the manner in which the wave varies spatially , or any analysis in mathematical terms of how a standing wave changes under the lorentz transformation .  nor is consideration given to the constraints imposed by special relativity on the form that such a wave might take .     by leaving the spatial variation of the phenomenon undefined",
    ", de broglie allowed the possibility that it is a standing wave with no spatial variation - a node - free standing wave that has everywhere the same phase and amplitude ( as in fig .",
    "1(b)(i ) ) .  a wave of that form would comprise counter - propagating waves of infinite wavelength and velocity contrary to the assumptions of special relativity .",
    "but it is nonetheless a featureless standing wave of this kind that de broglie seems to contemplate in the thesis , and when lorentz transformed , this featureless standing wave becomes ( as will be seen in sects . 5  and 6  below )",
    "a correspondingly featureless carrier wave subject to a sinusoidal modulation ( as in fig .",
    "1(b)(ii ) ) .    in the transformed wave structure ,",
    "the only wave  that is distinguished by a spatial variation is thus the modulation , which for a particle moving at velocity @xmath4 , evolves through the carrier wave at the superluminal velocity @xmath5 .",
    "it became possible for de broglie to conclude  then ( or so we surmise ) that when lorentz transformed the standing wave simply becomes an independent superluminal wave of velocity @xmath5 .",
    "however , it will be shown in the next section that a standing wave , whatever its form or frequency , becomes to an observer for whom the rest frame of the wave is moving at velocity @xmath4 , a carrier wave of that velocity , subject to a phase modulation having the wave characteristics and superluminal velocity @xmath5 of the de broglie wave .",
    "consider a standing wave of form , @xmath12where @xmath13 describes the spatial variation of the wave , and @xmath14 is its evolution in time .",
    "this wave thus has a well - defined sinusoidal frequency and might be expected to vary sinusoidally in space as well as time .",
    "but for now , we will follow de broglie in leaving the spatial variation of the wave intentionally vague .     we want to know the form that this periodic phenomenon  would take when observed from a frame of reference in which the particle is moving with velocity @xmath4 .  assuming a boost in the @xmath15 direction , and applying the lorentz transformation , @xmath16:@xmath17where @xmath18 is the lorentz factor,@xmath19standing wave ( [ gen ] ) becomes the moving wave,@xmath20which has two wave factors .",
    "the first,@xmath21is a carrier wave , which is moving at the velocity @xmath4 and , as indicated by the inclusion of the lorentz factor @xmath18 , has suffered the contraction of length predicted by special relativity .",
    "the second wave factor,@xmath22is a transverse plane wave , which is moving through the carrier wave ( lorgen ) at the superluminal velocity @xmath5 .  identifying the frequency @xmath23 with the characteristic frequency @xmath24 of a massive particle , wave factor ( [ lormod ] )",
    "can be rewritten in terms of the einstein frequency,@xmath25and de broglie wave number,@xmath26as,@xmath27and is now more clearly identifiable as the de broglie wave .  however , it is not here the independent wave supposed by de broglie , but as we have stressed , the modulation of the carrier wave ( [ lorgen ] ) , defining the dephasing of that wave ( and the failure of simultaneity ) in the direction of travel .",
    "it is the modulated wave,@xmath28rather than the de broglie wave ( [ debr ] ) that displays the full complement of changes in length , time and simultaneity contemplated by special relativity .",
    "it is suggested that it would be anomalous if any spatially extended phenomenon , wave or otherwise , could be  lorentz transformed into something that did not incorporate all these changes .",
    "yet , as will be seen in sects .",
    "4 to 6 , the carrier wave is effectively suppressed in de broglie s derivations .",

    "it is not possible for a point to become , by lorentz transformation , an extended wave .  under a lorentz transformation ,",
    "a point remains a point , and a wave , although changed in form , remains a wave .",

    "( [ mpoint ] ) does have the functional form ( [ debr ] ) of the de broglie wave , it is not in this case a wave , and it is not therefore the de broglie wave .",
    "that this is so may be intuitively obvious , but will be of some importance in understanding de broglie s analyses .",
    "de broglie was correct in insisting that if the moving particle is to be associated with a spatially extended waveform , some such waveform must also exist in the rest frame of the particle .",
    "but it will become apparent in the next section ( sect .",
    "4 ) that de broglie disregarded this extended waveform when applying what he referred to as the theorem of the harmony of phases .",
    "it will be seen that by confining  his consideration of phase to the phase of the particle at the position of the particle , he derived , not the de broglie wave , but what was in effect the variation in phase of a moving and oscillating point .",
    "a difficulty of a different kind will be encountered in sects . 5 and 6 below when we consider de broglie s two further demonstrations of his wave .",
    "it is not every wave of the form ( [ gen ] ) to which the lorentz transformation can be validly applied .",
    "it was not stipulated when defining wave ( [ gen ] ) that it should comprise underlying influences propagating at the velocity @xmath2 of light .  yet",
    "it is that velocity ( together with relative velocity @xmath4 ) that determines the velocity @xmath5 of the modulation .",
    "it is the lorentz transformation itself that imposes the velocity @xmath2 , and it does so because it is assumed in special relativity that all underlying influences develop ultimately at that velocity ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite , sect .",
    "6 ) .    or",
    "to put this another way , the de broglie wave is not merely evidence of the wave - like nature of matter , but provides confirmation through its velocity @xmath5 that the wave - like influences underlying matter and its interactions evolve ultimately at the free space velocity @xmath2 of light .",
    "the lorentz transformation can be appropriately applied to a standing wave formed from waves of a velocity other than @xmath2 , but only if the velocity of underlying influences is nonetheless @xmath2 , as is so for instance in the case of counter - propagating sound or water waves , where changes in underlying electromagnetic fields propagate at that velocity , or counter propagating light waves of velocity @xmath33 in a medium of refractive index @xmath34 .",
    "but the lorentz transformation can not be validly applied to a standing wave of the form ( [ gen ] ) if the spatial variation @xmath13 is unphysical , as in the case of the standing wave that is entirely without spatial variation referred to in the previous section ( sect .",
    "such a wave would be composed from influences of infinite wavelength and thus infinite velocity , contrary to special relativity .",
    "but a wave of that kind might nonetheless be simulated , at least in principle , by an array of identical oscillators .",
    "such a simulation will be encountered in the second of de broglie s three demonstrations ( to be discussed in sect .",
    "4 ) , while the unphysical wave simulated will itself be seen in the third ( sect . 5 ) .",

    "according to the general theorem , the surface has a speed [ @xmath5 ] parallel to that of the disk ... with this example we see clearly ( and this is our excuse for such protracted insistence on it ) how the phase wave corresponds to the transport of the phase and not at all to that of the energy . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in other words , the sinusoidal surface defined by the moving springs is an instance of his  phase wave ( the de broglie wave ) , while the general theorem  de broglie relies upon is his theorem of the harmony of phases .",
    "de broglie seems not to have noticed that the standing wave ( the array of oscillating weights ) has not simply become the de broglie wave .",
    "it has become a structure moving at velocity @xmath4 ( a moving array of oscillating weights ) subject to a modulation moving at velocity @xmath5 .  in treating the modulation as an independent wave",
    ", de broglie has ignored the structure that it modulates .    in its rest frame , this toy model is not strictly speaking of course a standing wave .",
    "it is merely the _ simulation _ of a standing wave ; in fact , the simulation of a physically unreasonable nodeless standing wave that has everywhere the same phase and amplitude .",
    "while an assemblage of synchronized oscillators would not itself be physically unreasonable , the wave thus modelled would comprise underlying influences of infinite velocity contrary to special velocity .",
    "but even ignoring that difficulty , it was shown in sect .",
    "3 that the application of the lorentz transformation to a standing wave of any form results formally , not in an independent wave of velocity @xmath5 , but in a carrier wave of velocity @xmath4 subject to a modulation of velocity @xmath5 .",
    "de broglie s model becomes under a lorentz transformation , not the simulation of an independent de broglie wave , but the simulation of a modulated wave of velocity @xmath4 in which the de broglie wave is the modulation .    if de broglie had supposed an assemblage of springs that varies sinusoidally in space as well as time ( and thus of the general form depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , and in which underlying influences move at velocity @xmath2 , he would have had in that model , a de broglie wave that is physically reasonable and consistent with special relativity .",
    "but when he sought to recover the classical velocity of the particle from his superluminal wave , the analogy he drew was with the group velocity of a wave packet formed from the superposition of de broglie waves of nearly equal frequency ( see de broglie @xcite , chap 1 , sect ii ) .",
    "it was from that very different physical  effect that the difficult concept of a particle wave packet was carried into quantum mechanics .",
    "by representing a standing wave in a spacetime diagram , de broglie was able to derive the velocity of the de broglie wave , while demonstrating in an intuitive manner the dephasing and consequent failure of simultaneity defined by this wave .",

    "its coordinates differ according to the frame to which it is referred .",
    "thus , if the de broglie wave and the transformed standing wave were the same wave they would share the same world line in the drawings .",
    "but that is not so .",
    "consider the standing wave .  in its rest frame ,",
    "a standing wave is , by definition , stationary .",
    "the world line of any point in that wave thus follows the time axis of its rest frame , which in this case is the @xmath56 axis of the primed frame of fig .",
    "4 .     or we could consider instead some extended region within the wave , let us say a spherical region enclosing the particle .  instead of a world line , the passage through spacetime of such a region defines a world tube  ( see , for example , misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite , p. 473 ) , which in this case , and as shown in fig .",
    "4 , would enclose the world line of the particle  which is following the primed @xmath64 axis .    on the other hand , the superluminal velocity @xmath5 of the de broglie wave implies a world line ( or tube , but it will suffice now to speak of a line ) lying beyond the light cone and parallel to the @xmath60 axis .  thus the standing wave does not simply become the de broglie wave , as was assumed by de broglie .    one further feature of fig .",
    "4 should be noticed .",
    "the fact that the world line of the de broglie wave is parallel to the @xmath60 axis ( or , in fig .",
    "5 , the @xmath15 axis ) means that in the rest frame of the particle , this wave is of infinite velocity .",
    "that velocity would be anomalous in an independent wave , but acquires a natural explanation once the de broglie wave is understood as a modulation .  at rest , the crests of the underlying wave are no longer peaking in sequence , but in unison , simultaneity has been restored , alignment of phase has become instantaneous , and the velocity of the modulation describing the progress of that alignment has thus become infinite .     in effect ,",
    "modulation and carrier have merged in the standing wave , and the de broglie wave has disappeared .",
    "there is in de broglie s thesis an evocative and much - cited passage that captures the essence of his notion of wave - particle duality :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the particle glides on its wave , so that the internal vibration of the particle remains in phase with the vibration of the wave at the point where it finds itself ( de broglie @xcite , chap . 1 , sect . 1 ) .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and this in a sense is true .  as discussed in sect . 4 above , the particle , considered as a subluminal moving point , changes phase ( see eqn .",
    "( debphase ) ) as if it were maintaining consistency of phase with a superluminal wave having the characteristics of an independent de broglie wave .",
    "but in referring to an internal vibration  de broglie seems to deny the spatially extended standing wave from which , as we saw in sect 2 , he commenced his analysis .",
    "this and other references in de broglie s writings to the oscillation of frequency @xmath24 being intrinsicor internal  or even fictitious  ( see , for instance , de broglie @xcite ) may be explained by de broglie s insistence that wave and particle are ontologically distinct entities .",
    "but it has been shown here that if the characteristic frequency @xmath24 of the particle is taken to be that of a standing wave , as de broglie himself proposed , the de broglie wave arises as an immediate consequence of the failure of simultaneity described by the lorentz transformation .     in none of",
    "de broglie s demonstrations in the thesis is the de broglie wave the independent superluminal wave that de broglie contemplated .  in the first , harmonizing of phases occurs only for an oscillating point within each wave and not for the wave as a whole .",
    "the result of lorentz transforming that oscillating point is not a spatially extended wave , but the path described by a moving oscillating point .  in the second ( the mechanical model ) and the third ( the minkowski diagram ) , the de broglie wave emerges from the antecedent standing wave , not as a wave in its own right , but as the modulation of an underlying standing wave .    the reinterpretation of the de broglie wave as a modulation would not affect the formal core of quantum mechanics .",
    "the de broglie wave or wave function would still evolve in accordance with the wave characteristics determined by the relevant wave equation .",
    "but much that has seemed anomalous would be explained .",
    "the superluminal velocity of the wave would not then be that of energy ( or information ) transport , consistency with special relativity would be achieved  and there would be no need to equate the velocity of a massive particle with the group velocity of a superposition of such waves .     nor",
    "would it be at all mysterious that the superluminal wave does not outrun the subluminal particle or fly off at a tangent from a particle orbit .",
    "a modulation must remain forever coextensive with the wave it modulates .",
    "as the particle changed direction , there would simply be a corresponding change in the direction of dephasing and a rearrangement of phase throughout the modulated wave .",
    "this rearrangement of phase would unfold not at the superluminal velocity of the de broglie , but at the velocity of the constituent influences of the underlying wave , which for consistency with special relativity we assume to be the velocity @xmath2 of light .",
    "but it is the suggestion of a deeper wave structure underlying the de broglie wave that could have the larger significance for quantum theory . in the  mystery of wave - particle duality ,",
    "the role of wave has been played solely by the de broglie wave .  if the de broglie wave is the modulation of a underlying standing wave structure , it becomes possible to speculate that this underlying wave , moving at the velocity of the particle and following a well - defined trajectory , might explain both the wave and the particulate properties of the particle .     and",
    "composed of influences evolving at the speed of light , the existence of this underlying structure would imply a deeper and more natural unity in nature than could be guessed at if the only wave associated with a massive particle were of superluminal velocity and unknown ontology .",
