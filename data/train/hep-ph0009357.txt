    "because qcd is asymptotically free , its high temperature and high baryon density phases are more simply and more appropriately described in terms of quarks and gluons as degrees of freedom , rather than hadrons .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking condensate which characterizes the vacuum melts away . at high temperatures , in the resulting quark - gluon plasma phase all of the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian are unbroken and the excitations have the quantum numbers of quarks and gluons . at high densities ,",
    "on the other hand , quarks form cooper pairs and new condensates develop . the formation of such superconducting phases  @xcite requires only weak attractive interactions ; these phases may nevertheless break chiral symmetry  @xcite and have excitations with the same quantum numbers as those in a confined phase  @xcite .",
    "these cold dense quark matter phases may arise in the cores of neutron stars ; understanding this region of the qcd phase diagram requires an interplay between qcd and neutron star phenomenology .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom in cold dense quark matter are those which involve quarks with momenta near the fermi surface . at high density , where the quark number chemical potential @xmath0 ( and hence the quark fermi momentum ) is large",
    ", the qcd gauge coupling @xmath1 is small .",
    "however , because of the infinite degeneracy among pairs of quarks with equal and opposite momenta at the fermi surface , even an arbitrarily weak attraction between quarks renders the fermi surface unstable to the formation of a condensate of quark cooper pairs . creating a pair costs no free energy at the fermi surface and the attractive interaction results in a free energy benefit .",
    "pairs of quarks can not be color singlets , and in qcd with two flavors of massless quarks , they form in the ( attractive ) color @xmath2 channel in which the quarks in a cooper pair are color - antisymmetric  @xcite .",
    "the resulting condensate creates a gap @xmath3 at the fermi surfaces of quarks with two out of three colors , but quarks of the third color remain gapless .",
    "five gluons get a meissner mass by the anderson - higgs mechanism  @xcite ; a @xmath4 subgroup remains unbroken .",
    "the cooper pairs are flavor singlets and no flavor symmetries are broken .",
    "there is also an unbroken global symmetry which plays the role of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , no global symmetries are broken in this 2sc phase .",
    "there must therefore be a phase transition between the hadronic and 2sc phases at which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "this phase transition is first order  @xcite since it involves a competition between chiral condensation and diquark condensation  @xcite .    in qcd with three flavors of massless quarks , the cooper pairs _ can not _ be flavor singlets , and both color and flavor symmetries are necessarily broken .",
    "the symmetries of the phase which results have been analyzed in  @xcite . the attractive channel favored by one - gluon exchange exhibits `` color - flavor locking . ''",
    "a condensate of the form @xmath6 involving left - handed quarks alone , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 color indices and @xmath9 , @xmath10 flavor indices , locks @xmath11 flavor rotations to @xmath12 : the condensate is not symmetric under either alone , but is symmetric under the simultaneous @xmath13 rotations .",
    "a condensate involving right - handed quarks alone locks @xmath14 flavor rotations to @xmath12 . because color is vectorial , the combined effect of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 condensates is to lock @xmath11 to @xmath14 , breaking chiral symmetry .",
    "thus , in quark matter with three massless quarks , the @xmath17 symmetry is broken down to the global diagonal @xmath18 group .",
    "a gauged @xmath19 subgroup of the original symmetry group  a linear combination of one color generator and electromagnetism , which lives within @xmath20  also remains unbroken .",
    "all nine quarks have a gap .",
    "all eight gluons get a mass  @xcite .",
    "there are nine massless nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "all the quarks , all the massive vector bosons , and all the nambu - goldstone bosons have integer charges under the unbroken gauged @xmath19 symmetry , which therefore plays the role of electromagnetism .",
    "the cfl phase therefore has the same symmetries ( and many similar non - universal features ) as baryonic matter with a condensate of cooper pairs of baryons  @xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that quark matter and baryonic matter may be continuously connected  @xcite .",
    "nature chooses two light quarks and one middle - weight strange quark , rather than three degenerate quarks .",
    "a nonzero @xmath21 weakens condensates which involve pairing between light and strange quarks .",
    "the cfl phase requires @xmath22 and @xmath23 condensates ; such condensates which pair quarks with differing fermi momenta can only exist if the resulting gaps are larger than of order @xmath24 , the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath26 fermi momenta in the absence of pairing .",
    "this means that upon increasing @xmath21 at fixed @xmath0 , one must find a first - order unlocking transition  @xcite : for larger @xmath21 only @xmath25 and @xmath27 quarks pair and the 2sc phase is obtained . for any @xmath28 ,",
    "the cfl phase is the ground state at arbitrarily high density  @xcite . for large values of @xmath21",
    ", there is a 2sc interlude : as a function of increasing @xmath0 , one finds a first order phase transition at which hadronic matter is replaced by quark matter in the 2sc phase and a subsequent first order phase transition at a higher @xmath0 above which cfl quark matter takes over . for smaller values of @xmath21 ,",
    "the possibility of quark - hadron continuity  @xcite arises .",
    "much effort has gone into estimating the magnitude of the gaps in the 2sc and cfl phases , and the consequent critical temperature above which quark matter ceases to be superconducting .",
    "it would be ideal if this task were within the scope of lattice gauge theory .",
    "unfortunately , lattice methods relying on importance sampling have to this point been rendered exponentially impractical at nonzero baryon density by the complex action at nonzero @xmath0 .",
    "there are more sophisticated algorithms which have allowed the simulation of theories which are simpler than qcd but which have as severe a fermion sign problem as that in qcd at nonzero chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "this bodes well for the future .",
    "given the current absence of suitable lattice methods , the magnitude of the gaps in quark matter at large but accessible @xmath0 has been estimated using two broad strategies .",
    "the first class of estimates are done within the context of models whose parameters are chosen to reproduce zero density physics  @xcite .",
    "the second strategy for estimating gaps and critical temperatures is to use @xmath29 physics as a guide . at asymptotically large @xmath0",
    ", models with short - range interactions are bound to fail because the dominant interaction is due to the long - range magnetic interaction coming from single - gluon exchange  @xcite .",
    "the collinear infrared divergence in small angle scattering via one - gluon exchange ( which is regulated by dynamical screening  @xcite ) results in a gap which is parametrically larger at @xmath30 than it would be for any point - like four - fermion interaction  @xcite .",
    "weak coupling estimates of the gap  @xcite are valid at asymptotically high densities , with chemical potentials @xmath31  mev  @xcite .",
    "neither class of methods can be trusted quantitatively for quark number chemical potentials",
    "@xmath32  mev , as appropriate for the quark matter which may occur in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "it is nevertheless satisfying that two very different approaches , one using zero density phenomenology to normalize models , the other using weak - coupling methods valid at asymptotically high density , yield predictions for the gaps and critical temperatures at accessible densities which are in good agreement : the gaps at the fermi surface are of order tens to 100  mev , with critical temperatures about half as large .",
    "@xmath33  mev is much larger relative to the fermi momentum than in low temperature superconductivity in metals .",
    "this reflects the fact that color superconductivity is induced by an attraction due to the primary , strong , interaction in the theory , rather than having to rely on much weaker secondary interactions , as in phonon mediated superconductivity in metals .",
    "quark matter is a high-@xmath34 superconductor by any reasonable definition .",
    "its @xmath34 is nevertheless low enough that it is unlikely the phenomenon can be realized in heavy ion collisions .",
    "our current understanding of the color superconducting state of quark matter leads us to believe that it may occur naturally in compact stars .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath34 below which quark matter is a color superconductor is high enough that any quark matter which occurs within neutron stars that are more than a few seconds old is in a color superconducting state . in the absence of lattice simulations , present theoretical methods are not accurate enough to determine whether neutron star cores are made of hadronic matter or quark matter .",
    "they also can not determine whether any quark matter which arises will be in the cfl or 2sc phase : the difference between the @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 fermi momenta will be a few tens of mev which is comparable to estimates of the gap @xmath3 ; the cfl phase occurs when @xmath3 is large compared to all differences between fermi momenta .",
    "just as the higher temperature regions of the qcd phase diagram are being mapped out in heavy ion collisions , we need to learn how to use neutron star phenomena to determine whether they feature cores made of 2sc quark matter , cfl quark matter or hadronic matter , thus teaching us about the high density region of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "it is therefore important to look for astrophysical consequences of color superconductivity .",
    "much of the work on the consequences of quark matter within a compact star has focussed on the effects of quark matter on the equation of state , and hence on the radius of the star . as a fermi surface phenomenon ,",
    "color superconductivity has little effect on the equation of state : the pressure is an integral over the whole fermi volume .",
    "color superconductivity modifies the equation of state at the @xmath35 level , typically by a few percent  @xcite .",
    "such small effects can be neglected in present calculations , and for this reason we will not attempt to survey the many ways in which observations of neutron stars are being used to constrain the equation of state  @xcite .",
    "we will describe one current idea , however . as a neutron star in a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb )",
    "is spun up by accretion from its companion , it becomes more oblate and its central density decreases . if it contains a quark matter core , the volume fraction occupied by this core decreases , the star expands , and its moment of inertia increases .",
    "this raises the possibility  @xcite of a period during the spin - up history of an lmxb when the neutron star is gaining angular momentum via accretion , but is gaining sufficient moment of inertia that its angular frequency is hardly increasing . in their modelling of this effect , glendenning and weber  @xcite discover that lmxb s should spend a significant fraction of their history with a frequency of around 200  hz , while their quark cores are being spun out of existence , before eventually spinning up to higher frequencies .",
    "this may explain the observation that lmxb frequencies are clustered around 250 - 350  hz  @xcite , which is otherwise puzzling in that it is thought that lmxb s provide the link between canonical pulsars and millisecond pulsars , which have frequencies as large as 600  hz  @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see how robust the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is to changes in model assumptions and also how its predictions fare when compared to those of other explanations which posit upper bounds on lmxb frequencies  @xcite , rather than a most probable frequency range with no associated upper bound  @xcite .",
    "we note here that because glendenning and weber s effect depends only on the equation of state and not on other properties of quark matter , the fact that the quark matter must in fact be a color superconductor will not affect the results in any significant way .",
    "if glendenning and weber s explanation for the observed clustering of lmxb frequencies proves robust , it would imply that pulsars with lower rotational frequencies feature quark matter cores .",
    "we turn now to neutron star phenomena which _ are _ affected by fermi surface physics . for the first @xmath36 years of its life , the cooling of a neutron star is governed by the balance between heat capacity and the loss of heat by neutrino emission .",
    "how are these quantities affected by the presence of a quark matter core ?",
    "this has been addressed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite , following earlier work in ref .  @xcite .",
    "both the specific heat @xmath37 and the neutrino emission rate @xmath38 are dominated by physics within @xmath39 of the fermi surface . if , as in the cfl phase , all quarks have a gap @xmath40 then the contribution of quark quasiparticles to @xmath37 and @xmath38 is suppressed by @xmath41 .",
    "there may be other contributions to @xmath38  @xcite , but these are also very small .",
    "the specific heat is dominated by that of the electrons , although it may also receive a small contribution from the cfl phase goldstone bosons .",
    "although further work is required , it is already clear that both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are much smaller than in the nuclear matter outside the quark matter core .",
    "this means that the total heat capacity and the total neutrino emission rate ( and hence the cooling rate ) of a neutron star with a cfl core will be determined completely by the nuclear matter outside the core .",
    "the quark matter core is `` inert '' : with its small heat capacity and emission rate it has little influence on the temperature of the star as a whole .",
    "as the rest of the star emits neutrinos and cools , the core cools by conduction , because the electrons keep it in good thermal contact with the rest of the star .",
    "these qualitative expectations are nicely borne out in the calculations presented by page et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the cooling history of a neutron star with a quark matter core in the 2sc phase is more complicated . the red and green up and down quarks pair with a gap many orders of magnitude larger than the temperature , which is of order 10 kev , and are therefore inert as described above .",
    "any strange quarks present will form a @xmath42 condensate with angular momentum @xmath43 which locks to color in such a way that rotational invariance is not broken  @xcite .",
    "the resulting gap has been estimated to be of order hundreds of kev  @xcite , although applying results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests a somewhat smaller gap , around 10 kev .",
    "the blue up and down quarks also pair , forming a @xmath43 condensate which breaks rotational invariance  @xcite .",
    "the related gap was estimated to be a few kev  @xcite , but this estimate was not robust and should be revisited in light of more recent developments given its importance in the following .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath34 above which no condensate forms is of order the zero - temperature gap @xmath3 .",
    "( @xmath44 for @xmath45 condensates  @xcite . ) therefore , if there are quarks for which @xmath46 or smaller , these quarks do not pair at temperature @xmath39 .",
    "such quark quasiparticles will radiate neutrinos rapidly ( via direct urca reactions like @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc . ) and the quark matter core will cool rapidly and determine the cooling history of the star as a whole  @xcite .",
    "the star will cool rapidly until its interior temperature is @xmath49 , at which time the quark matter core will become inert and the further cooling history will be dominated by neutrino emission from the nuclear matter fraction of the star .",
    "if future data were to show that neutron stars first cool rapidly ( direct urca ) and then cool more slowly , such data would allow an estimate of the smallest quark matter gap .",
    "we are unlikely to be so lucky .",
    "the simple observation of rapid cooling would _ not _ be an unambiguous discovery of quark matter with small gaps ; there are other circumstances in which the direct urca processes occur . however , if as data on neutron star temperatures improves in coming years the standard cooling scenario proves correct , indicating the absence of the direct urca processes , this _ would _ rule out the presence of quark matter with gaps in the 10 kev range or smaller .",
    "the presence of a quark matter core in which _ all _ gaps are @xmath50 can never be revealed by an analysis of the cooling history .",
    "we now turn from neutrino emission from a neutron star which is many years old to that from the protoneutron star during the first seconds of a supernova .",
    "carter and reddy  @xcite have pointed out that when this protoneutron star is at its maximum temperature of order 30 - 50  mev , it may have a quark matter core which is too hot for color superconductivity .",
    "as such a protoneutron star core cools over the next few seconds , this quark matter will cool through @xmath34 , entering the color superconducting regime of the qcd phase diagram . for @xmath51 , the specific heat rises and the cooling slows . then , as @xmath39 drops further and @xmath3 increases to become greater than @xmath39 , the specific heat drops rapidly .",
    "furthermore , as the number density of quark quasiparticles becomes suppressed by @xmath52 , the neutrino transport mean free path rapidly becomes very long  @xcite .",
    "this means that all the neutrinos previously trapped in the now color superconducting core are able to escape in a sudden burst .",
    "if a terrestrial neutrino detector sees thousands of neutrinos from a future supernova , carter and reddy s results suggest that there may be a signature of the transition to color superconductivity present in the time distribution of these neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos from the core of the protoneutron star will lose energy as they scatter on their way out , but because they will be the last to reach the surface of last scattering , they will be the final neutrinos received at the earth .",
    "if they are released from the quark matter core in a sudden burst , they may therefore result in a bump at late times in the temporal distribution of the detected neutrinos .",
    "more detailed study remains to be done in order to understand how carter and reddy s signature , dramatic when the neutrinos escape from the core , is processed as the neutrinos traverse the rest of the protoneutron star and reach their surface of last scattering .",
    "another arena in which color superconductivity comes into play is the physics of r - mode instabilities .",
    "a neutron star whose angular rotation frequency @xmath53 is large enough is unstable to the growth of r - mode oscillations which radiate away angular momentum via gravitational waves , reducing @xmath53 .",
    "what does `` large enough '' mean ?",
    "the answer depends on the damping mechanisms which act to prevent the growth of the relevant modes .",
    "both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity act to damp the r - modes , preventing them from going unstable .",
    "the bulk viscosity and the quark contribution to the shear viscosity both become exponentially small in quark matter with @xmath54 and as a result , as madsen  @xcite has shown , a compact star made _ entirely _ of quark matter with gaps @xmath55  mev or greater is unstable if its spin frequency is greater than tens to 100  hz .",
    "many compact stars spin faster than this , and madsen therefore argues that compact stars can not be strange quark stars unless some quarks remain ungapped . alas ,",
    "this powerful argument becomes much less powerful in the context of a neutron star with a quark matter core .",
    "first , the r - mode oscillations have a wave form whose amplitude is largest at large radius , outside the core .",
    "second , in an ordinary neutron star there is a new source of damping : friction at the boundary between the crust and the neutron superfluid `` mantle '' keeps the r - modes stable regardless of the properties of a quark matter core  @xcite .",
    "next , we turn to the physics of magnetic fields within color superconducting neutron star cores  @xcite .",
    "the interior of a conventional neutron star is a superfluid ( because of neutron - neutron pairing ) and is an electromagnetic superconductor ( because of proton - proton pairing ) .",
    "ordinary magnetic fields penetrate it only in the cores of magnetic flux tubes .",
    "a color superconductor behaves differently . at first glance",
    ", it seems that because a diquark cooper pair has nonzero electric charge , a diquark condensate must exhibit the standard meissner effect , expelling ordinary magnetic fields or restricting them to flux tubes within whose cores the condensate vanishes .",
    "this is not the case  @xcite . in both the 2sc and cfl phase a linear combination of the @xmath19 gauge transformation of ordinary electromagnetism and one",
    "( the eighth ) color gauge transformation remains unbroken even in the presence of the condensate .",
    "this means that the ordinary photon @xmath56 and the eighth gluon @xmath57 are replaced by new linear combinations @xmath58 where @xmath59 is massless and @xmath60 is massive .",
    "that is , @xmath61 satisfies the ordinary maxwell equations while @xmath62 experiences a meissner effect .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath63 is the analogue of the weinberg angle in electroweak theory , in which the presence of the higgs condensate causes the @xmath64 and the third @xmath65 gauge boson to mix to form the photon , @xmath56 , and the massive @xmath66 boson .",
    "@xmath67 is proportional to @xmath68 and turns out to be about @xmath69 in the 2sc phase and @xmath70 in the cfl phase  @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath71-photon which propagates in color superconducting quark matter is mostly photon with only a small gluon admixture .",
    "if a color superconducting neutron star core is subjected to an ordinary magnetic field , it will either expel the @xmath72 component of the flux or restrict it to flux tubes , but it can ( and does  @xcite ) admit the great majority of the flux in the form of a @xmath61 magnetic field satisfying maxwell s equations . the decay in time of this `` free field '' ( i.e. not in flux tubes )",
    "is limited by the @xmath71-conductivity of the quark matter .",
    "a color superconductor is not a @xmath71-superconductor  that is the whole point  but it turns out to be a very good @xmath71-conductor due to the presence of electrons : the @xmath61 magnetic field decays only on a time scale which is much longer than the age of the universe  @xcite .",
    "this means that a quark matter core within a neutron star serves as an `` anchor '' for the magnetic field : whereas in ordinary nuclear matter the magnetic flux tubes can be dragged outward by the neutron superfluid vortices as the star spins down  @xcite , the magnetic flux within the color superconducting core simply can not decay .",
    "even though this distinction is a qualitative one , it will be difficult to confront it with data since what is observed is the total dipole moment of the neutron star .",
    "a color superconducting core anchors those magnetic flux lines which pass through the core , while in a neutron star with no quark matter core the entire internal magnetic field can decay over time . in both cases , however , the total dipole moment can change since the magnetic flux lines which do not pass through the core can move .",
    "the final consequence of color superconductivity we wish to discuss is the possibility that ( some ) glitches may originate within quark matter regions of a compact star  @xcite . in any context",
    "in which color superconductivity arises in nature , it is likely to involve pairing between species of quarks with differing chemical potentials .",
    "if the chemical potential difference is small enough , bcs pairing occurs as we have been discussing .",
    "if the fermi surfaces are too far apart , no pairing between the species is possible .",
    "the transition between the bcs and unpaired states as the splitting between fermi momenta increases has been studied in electron superconductors  @xcite , nuclear superfluids  @xcite and qcd superconductors  @xcite , assuming that no other state intervenes .",
    "however , there is good reason to think that another state can occur .",
    "this is the `` loff '' state , first explored by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite and fulde and ferrell  @xcite in the context of electron superconductivity in the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "they found that near the unpairing transition , it is favorable to form a state in which the cooper pairs have nonzero momentum .",
    "this is favored because it gives rise to a region of phase space where each of the two quarks in a pair can be close to its fermi surface , and such pairs can be created at low cost in free energy .",
    "condensates of this sort spontaneously break translational and rotational invariance , leading to gaps which vary periodically in a crystalline pattern .",
    "if in some shell within the quark matter core of a neutron star ( or within a strange quark star ) the quark number densities are such that crystalline color superconductivity arises , rotational vortices may be pinned in this shell , making it a locus for glitch phenomena .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have explored the range of parameters for which crystalline color superconductivity occurs in the qcd phase diagram , upon making various simplifying assumptions .",
    "we focus primarily on a toy model in which the quarks interact via a four - fermion interaction with the quantum numbers of single gluon exchange . also , we only consider pairing between @xmath25 and @xmath27 quarks , with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , whereas we expect a loff state wherever the difference between the fermi momenta of any two quark flavors is near an unpairing transition , including , for example , near the unlocking phase transition between the 2sc and cfl phases .    in the loff state",
    ", each cooper pair carries momentum @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the condensate and gap parameter vary in space with wavelength @xmath77 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we simplify the calculation by assuming that the condensate varies in space like a plane wave , leaving the determination of the crystal structure of the qcd loff phase to future work .",
    "we give an ansatz for the loff wave function , and by variation obtain a gap equation which allows us to solve for the gap parameter @xmath78 , the free energy and the values of the diquark condensates which characterize the loff state at a given @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we then vary @xmath80 , to find the preferred ( lowest free energy ) loff state at a given @xmath79 , and compare the free energy of the loff state to that of the bcs state with which it competes .",
    "we show results for one choice of parameters in fig .",
    "the loff state is characterized by a gap parameter @xmath78 and a diquark condensate , but not by an energy gap in the dispersion relation : we obtain the quasiparticle dispersion relations  @xcite and find that they vary with the direction of the momentum , yielding gaps that vary from zero up to a maximum of @xmath78 .",
    "the condensate is dominated by the regions in momentum space in which a quark pair with total momentum @xmath75 has both members of the pair within @xmath81 of their respective fermi surfaces .",
    "because it violates rotational invariance by involving cooper pairs whose momenta are not antiparallel , the quark matter loff state necessarily features condensates in both the @xmath45 and @xmath43 channels .",

    "both @xmath79 and @xmath87 vary as a function of density and hence as a function of radius in a compact star .",
    "although it is too early to make quantitative predictions , the numbers are such that crystalline color superconducting quark matter may very well occur in a range of radii within a compact star .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to consider the consequences .",
    "many pulsars have been observed to glitch .",
    "glitches are sudden jumps in rotation frequency @xmath53 which may be as large as @xmath113 , but may also be several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the frequency of observed glitches is statistically consistent with the hypothesis that all radio pulsars experience glitches  @xcite .",
    "glitches are thought to originate from interactions between the rigid neutron star crust , typically somewhat more than a kilometer thick , and rotational vortices in a neutron superfluid .",
    "the inner kilometer of crust consists of a crystal lattice of nuclei immersed in a neutron superfluid  @xcite . because the pulsar is spinning , the neutron superfluid ( both within the inner crust and deeper inside the star ) is threaded with a regular array of rotational vortices .",
    "as the pulsar s spin gradually slows , these vortices must gradually move outwards since the rotation frequency of a superfluid is proportional to the density of vortices . deep within the star , the vortices are free to move outwards . in the crust , however , the vortices are pinned by their interaction with the nuclear lattice .",
    "models  @xcite differ in important respects as to how the stress associated with pinned vortices is released in a glitch : for example , the vortices may break and rearrange the crust , or a cluster of vortices may suddenly overcome the pinning force and move macroscopically outward , with the sudden decrease in the angular momentum of the superfluid within the crust resulting in a sudden increase in angular momentum of the rigid crust itself and hence a glitch .",
    "all the models agree that the fundamental requirements are the presence of rotational vortices in a superfluid and the presence of a rigid structure which impedes the motion of vortices and which encompasses enough of the volume of the pulsar to contribute significantly to the total moment of inertia .",
    "although it is premature to draw quantitative conclusions , it is interesting to speculate that some glitches may originate deep within a pulsar which features a quark matter core , in a region of that core which is in a loff crystalline color superconductor phase .",
    "a three flavor analysis is required to estimate over what range of densities loff phases may arise , as either @xmath114 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 condensates approach their unpairing transitions .",
    "comparison to existing models which describe how @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 vary within a quark matter core in a neutron star  @xcite would then permit an estimate of how much the loff region contributes to the moment of inertia of the pulsar .",
    "furthermore , a three flavor analysis is required to determine whether the loff phase is a superfluid .",
    "if the only pairing is between @xmath25 and @xmath27 quarks , this 2sc phase is not a superfluid  @xcite , whereas if all three quarks pair in some way , a superfluid _ is _",
    "obtained  @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we suppose that the loff phase is a superfluid , which means that if it occurs within a pulsar it will be threaded by an array of rotational vortices .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that these vortices will be pinned in a loff crystal , in which the diquark condensate varies periodically in space .",
    "indeed , one of the suggestions for how to look for a loff phase in terrestrial electron superconductors relies on the fact that the pinning of magnetic flux tubes ( which , like the rotational vortices of interest to us , have normal cores ) is expected to be much stronger in a loff phase than in a uniform bcs superconductor  @xcite .",
    "a real calculation of the pinning force experienced by a vortex in a crystalline color superconductor must await the determination of the crystal structure of the loff phase .",
    "we can , however , attempt an order of magnitude estimate along the same lines as that done by anderson and itoh  @xcite for neutron vortices in the inner crust of a neutron star . in that context , this estimate has since been made quantitative  @xcite .",
    "for one specific choice of parameters  @xcite , the loff phase is favored over the normal phase by a free energy @xmath118 and the spacing between nodes in the loff crystal is @xmath119 fm .",
    "the thickness of a rotational vortex is given by the correlation length @xmath120 fm .",
    "the pinning energy is the difference between the energy of a section of vortex of length @xmath10 which is centered on a node of the loff crystal vs. one which is centered on a maximum of the loff crystal .",
    "it is of order @xmath121 .",
    "the resulting pinning force per unit length of vortex is of order @xmath122 .",
    "a complete calculation will be challenging because @xmath123 , and is likely to yield an @xmath124 which is somewhat less than that we have obtained by dimensional analysis .",
    "note that our estimate of @xmath124 is quite uncertain both because it is only based on dimensional analysis and because the values of @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath125 are uncertain .",
    "( we have a good understanding of all the ratios @xmath126 , @xmath92 , @xmath127 and consequently @xmath128 in the loff phase .",
    "it is of course the value of the bcs gap @xmath87 which is uncertain . )",
    "it is premature to compare our crude result to the results of serious calculations of the pinning of crustal neutron vortices as in refs .",
    "it is nevertheless remarkable that they prove to be similar : the pinning energy of neutron vortices in the inner crust is @xmath129 and the pinning force per unit length is @xmath130 .    the reader may be concerned that a glitch deep within the quark matter core of a neutron star may not be observable : the vortices within the crystalline color superconductor region suddenly unpin and leap outward ; this loss of angular momentum is compensated by a gain in angular momentum of the layer outside the loff region ; how quickly , then , does this increase in angular momentum manifest itself at the _ surface _ of the star as a glitch ?",
    "the important point here is that the rotation of any superfluid region within which the vortices are able to move freely is coupled to the rotation of the outer crust on very short time scales  @xcite .",
    "this rapid coupling , due to electron scattering off vortices and the fact that the electron fluid penetrates throughout the star , is usually invoked to explain that the core nucleon superfluid speeds up quickly after a crustal glitch : the only long relaxation time is that of the vortices within the inner crust  @xcite . here , we invoke it to explain that the outer crust speeds up rapidly after a loff glitch has accelerated the quark matter at the base of the nucleon superfluid . after a glitch in the loff region ,",
    "the only long relaxation times are those of the vortices in the loff region and in the inner crust .",
    "a quantitative theory of glitches originating within quark matter in a loff phase must await further calculations , in particular a three flavor analysis and the determination of the crystal structure of the qcd loff phase .",
    "however , our rough estimate of the pinning force on rotational vortices in a loff region suggests that this force may be comparable to that on vortices in the inner crust of a conventional neutron star .",
    "perhaps , therefore , glitches occurring in a region of crystalline color superconducting quark matter may yield similar phenomenology to those occurring in the inner crust .",
    "this is surely strong motivation for further investigation .",
    "perhaps the most interesting consequence of these speculations arises in the context of compact stars made entirely of strange quark matter .",
    "the work of witten  @xcite and farhi and jaffe  @xcite raised the possibility that strange quark matter may be stable relative to nuclear matter even at zero pressure .",
    "if this is the case it raises the question whether observed compact stars  pulsars , for example  are strange quark stars  @xcite rather than neutron stars .",
    "a conventional neutron star may feature a core made of strange quark matter , as we have been discussing above .",
    "strange quark stars , on the other hand , are made ( almost ) entirely of quark matter with either no hadronic matter content at all or with a thin crust , of order one hundred meters thick , which contains no neutron superfluid  @xcite .",
    "the nuclei in this thin crust are supported above the quark matter by electrostatic forces ; these forces can not support a neutron fluid . because of the absence of superfluid neutrons , and because of the thinness of the crust , no successful models of glitches in the crust of a strange quark star have been proposed .",
    "since pulsars are observed to glitch , the apparent lack of a glitch mechanism for strange quark stars has been the strongest argument that pulsars can not be strange quark stars  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion must now be revisited .",
    "madsen s conclusion  @xcite that a strange quark star is prone to r - mode instability due to the absence of damping must also be revisited , since the relevant oscillations may be damped within or at the boundary of a crystalline color superconductor region .",
    "the quark matter in a strange quark star , should one exist , would be a color superconductor .",
    "depending on the mass of the star , the quark number densities increase by a factor of about two to ten in going from the surface to the center  @xcite .",
    "this means that the chemical potential differences among the three quarks will vary also , and there could be a range of radii within which the quark matter is in a crystalline color superconductor phase .",
    "this raises the possibility of glitches in strange quark stars .",
    "because the variation in density with radius is gradual , if a shell of loff quark matter exists it need not be particularly thin . and ,",
    "we have seen , the pinning forces may be comparable in magnitude to those in the inner crust of a conventional neutron star .",
    "it has recently been suggested ( for reasons unrelated to our considerations ) that certain accreting compact stars may be strange quark stars  @xcite , although the evidence is far from unambiguous  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it has been thought that , because they glitch , conventional radio pulsars can not be strange quark stars .",
    "our work questions this assertion by raising the possibility that glitches may originate within a layer of quark matter which is in a crystalline color superconducting state .",
    "there has been much recent progress in our understanding of how the presence of color superconducting quark matter in a compact star would affect five different phenomena : cooling by neutrino emission , the pattern of the arrival times of supernova neutrinos , the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields , r - mode instabilities and glitches .",
    "nevertheless , much theoretical work remains to be done before we can make sharp proposals for which astrophysical observations can teach us whether compact stars contain quark matter , and if so whether it is in the 2sc or cfl phase .",
