    "they are also an important background in searches for high - energy astrophysical neutrinos , particularly in searches for a diffuse flux . in diffuse searches ,",
    "the significance of any signal depends critically on the assumed flux and spectral shape of the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "high - energy atmospheric neutrinos are typically divided into two classes : conventional and prompt @xcite .",
    "conventional neutrinos come from the decays of pions and kaons , and the muons produced when pions and kaons decay .",
    "pions and kaons have lifetimes long enough so that , at energies above @xmath6 tev , they are likely to interact before they decay ; the relative interaction probability increases linearly with energy , so the neutrino spectrum from decays at high energy is softer . at high energies , where most muons reach the ground before they decay , the principal sources of @xmath0 are the decays @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it was pointed out recently that @xmath9 and @xmath10 can decay to @xmath11 and contribute to the conventional muon flux , but not to the neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "prompt neutrinos come from the decays of charmed and bottom hadrons .",
    "these particles decay quickly ( critical energies @xmath12  gev or higher ) so the spectral index of neutrinos from their decays is similar to that of the primary cosmic - ray spectrum in the energy range considered here",
    ".    there have been many calculations of the conventional neutrino flux .",
    "several analytic calculations exist , mostly using the method of z - moments @xcite .",
    "other calculations use monte carlo simulations , often based on different hadronic interaction models @xcite .    in this work",
    "we evaluate the contribution of the rare , semileptonic decay of @xmath1 to the flux of @xmath0 .",
    "this contribution has been neglected previously because of its low branching ratio , which makes its contribution negligible below @xmath13  tev .",
    "for the same reason , this channel is not tracked in corsika  @xcite .",
    "although the semileptonic branching ratio is very small , the @xmath14 lifetime is very short , so that , in cosmic - ray air showers , it is more likely to decay than to interact . as a consequence ,",
    "its contribution to the flux of @xmath0 is one power harder in energy than those from @xmath5 and @xmath15 , so that at sufficiently high energy it contributes a significant fraction of the total .",
    "the characteristic energy @xmath16 that characterizes whether an unstable particle is more likely to interact or decay in the atmosphere is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the particles mass and lifetime , and @xmath20 is a scale height in the atmosphere , typically 6400 m @xcite .",
    "the energy at which hadronic interactions become important depends on the atmospheric density , which varies with zenith angle @xmath21 .",
    "interactions become predominant at energies above the critical energy : @xmath22 if the particle energy is higher than @xmath23 , then it is likely to interact before it can decay . below the critical energy for a given channel",
    ", the spectrum of neutrinos from kaon decays closely matches that of the cosmic - ray spectrum , roughly @xmath24 , with the neutrino taking an average of roughly 25% of the kaon energy for @xmath25 decays . at energies above the critical energy ,",

    "the @xmath1 contribution to the atmospheric @xmath0 flux is small , reduced by the ratio of the branching ratios @xmath29 : @xmath30 . at higher energies , above 210 gev@xmath31",
    ", the spectrum of @xmath0 from @xmath5-decay softens to @xmath32 , while the spectrum of @xmath0 from @xmath1 remains unchanged .",
    "thus , the relative @xmath0 contribution increases linearly with the energy . at the @xmath1 critical energy of 120 tev@xmath31 ,",
    "the ratio has increased by @xmath33 , and the @xmath1 and @xmath5 contributions to the @xmath0 flux are equal !",
    "this is not just a fortuitous numerical coincidence .",
    "it happens because the lifetime is inversely related to the total decay width , and the branching ratio is the ratio of the semileptonic width to the total width . with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "as long as the @xmath1 and @xmath5 are produced in equal numbers , the ratio of the @xmath0 fluxes for neutrino energies above the two @xmath23 is @xmath36    a similar argument applies for @xmath37 , which has a similar mass and semileptonic width as the @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , associated production in reactions like @xmath38 is different for @xmath4 than for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 from which the @xmath5 originate . as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution of charged kaons to the flux of @xmath0 is not exactly equal to that of @xmath5 .",
    "neglecting for the moment associated production , at energies @xmath41 , the inclusion of @xmath14 increases the @xmath0 flux by about 50% . for quasi - vertical angles of incidence ,",
    "this increase occurs at energies of @xmath42 tev , which is the range in which most current searches for extra - terrestrial neutrinos are focused . at higher energies , the enhancement is large for a wider angular range , but the conventional @xmath0 flux is overshadowed by the prompt flux .",
    "a similar enhancement occurs for @xmath43 , via @xmath44 .",
    "however , because of the large @xmath43 contribution from two - body decays of charged kaons and pions , it is much less significant .",
    "figure 7 of  @xcite gives the relative contribution to @xmath43 production of @xmath45 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath46 decay .",
    "@xmath4 decay dominates at energies above 500 gev ; the contribution from @xmath5 is negligible , so , at higher energies , the @xmath1 contribution will remain small .",
    "there are additional @xmath0 contributions from the semileptonic decays of strange baryons like the @xmath47 and @xmath48 ; some of these baryons have semileptonic branching ratios similar to that of the @xmath1 .",
    "however , their production rates are lower , and the neutrino carries only a relatively small fraction of the incident baryon momentum .",
    "so , their contribution to the total flux should be small .",

    "the calculation is a generalization of the scaling solutions of the coupled cascade equations for hadronic cascades in the atmosphere  @xcite in which the spectrum weighted moments are allowed to depend on energy in order to take account of the non - power - law behavior of the primary spectrum ( the knee ) .",
    "the z - factors for production of charged kaons , for example , are generalized to @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the nucleon interaction length , d@xmath52 is the number of charged kaons produced in d@xmath53 by nucleons of energy @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the spectrum of nucleons .",

    "the critical energy for @xmath1 is @xmath75  tev@xmath76 , and the neutrino flux from @xmath15 and @xmath5 increases significantly toward the horizontal . as a consequence ,",
    "when the flux is averaged over zenith angle , the onset of the saturation of the @xmath1 contribution is delayed by an order of magnitude to @xmath77 pev .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath1 states are not directly produced in hadronic interactions .",
    "instead they are rotations of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . between production and decay ,",

    "the probability for a neutral kaon to interact or decay as @xmath80 or @xmath81 at a later time is given by the probability to find the system in one state or the other .",
    "when the states are fully mixed , equal numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath82 are produced in the ke3 decays of @xmath5 . in the high energy limit , however , when the neutral kaons interact before they are fully evolved , then asymptotically the relative number of @xmath0 and @xmath82 reflects the relative importance of @xmath83 and @xmath84 at production just as the neutrinos from decay of charged kaons reflect the relative production of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "regeneration of @xmath1 when neutral kaons interact in the atmosphere may also affect the flux of neutrinos .",
    "the effects of kaon oscillations in the cascade equations from which eq .",

    "thus the oscillation period is @xmath89  s. whether the neutral kaons are more likely to interact before or after the oscillations are fully evolved depends on the structure of the atmosphere in the same way as the competition between decay and interaction . as a consequence",

    "we expect approximately 74% @xmath0 and 26% @xmath82 at all energies .",

    "figure  [ fig : oscillation ] shows how the fraction @xmath96 evolves with energy .",

    "previous measurements of the @xmath0 flux have focused on the energy range below a few tev @xcite , so have not been sensitive to the @xmath1-induced component .",
