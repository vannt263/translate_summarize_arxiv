    "<S> that is , @xmath14 with the sum over all proper colorings @xmath15 of @xmath4 .    </S>",

    "<S> symmetric function _ if it remains the same after any permutation of its variables . </S>",
    "<S> the chromatic symmetric function @xmath10 is indeed symmetric , since the properness of a coloring is preserved under any permutation of the set of colors @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural , then , is to consider the expansion of @xmath10 in various bases of the ring of symmetric functions @xmath18 , and there are a number of conjectures and open problem concerning positivity of @xmath10 in these bases .    </S>",
    "<S> our present interest is in the larger ring @xmath19 of _ quasisymmetric functions_. a formal power series of bounded degree @xmath20 in the variables @xmath11 is called _ quasisymmetric _ if the coefficient of @xmath21 in @xmath20 is the same as the coefficient of @xmath22 in @xmath20 whenever @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",

    "<S> if each @xmath35 is nonnegative , we will say that @xmath20 is @xmath3-positive . in @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> a hypergraph is a graph where the edges are allowed to contain more than two elements ; that is , a hypergraph is a pair @xmath38 , @xmath9 finite , where @xmath39 is a family of subsets of @xmath9 called the hyperedges ( or just edges ) of @xmath1 with @xmath40 for each @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we say @xmath41 is _ monochromatic _ under the coloring @xmath42 if @xmath15 maps all of @xmath43 to a single color @xmath12 , so that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , and a coloring @xmath15 of @xmath1 is _ proper _ if no edge of @xmath1 is monochromatic under @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it might seem more natural to require that each @xmath45 have a different color </S>",
    "<S> . however , as stanley notes in @xcite , these colorings would be the same as the proper colorings of the ordinary graph obtained by replacing each hyperedge @xmath41 by the complete graph on @xmath43 , so nothing new would be gained by considering hypergraphs .    </S>",
    "<S> the chromatic symmetric function @xmath0 is then defined , as before , by @xmath46 where the sum is taken over all proper colorings @xmath15 of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> again @xmath0 is symmetric , but unlike in the case of ordinary graphs , @xmath0 is not always @xmath3-positive . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath38 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 then @xmath49 is not @xmath3-positive . </S>",
    "<S> the reader might observe that the coefficients in sum to @xmath50 , and this is not a coincidence . </S>",

    "<S> thus when @xmath0 is @xmath3-positive , we might expect then to be able to write @xmath0 as a sum of fundamental quasisymmetric functions indexed by permutations , and this is what we proceed to do for a certain class of hypergraphs : the _ hypertrees _ with prime - sized edges . </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of closely - related definitions of _ hypertree _ occurring in the literature ; we adopt the definition given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath38 be a hypergraph . </S>",
    "<S> a _ path _ in @xmath1 is a nonempty sequence @xmath54 where each @xmath55 with @xmath56 and the edges @xmath57 and vertices @xmath58 of the path are distinct , except that we allow @xmath59 . if @xmath59 and @xmath60 we say the path is a _ </S>",

    "<S> for example , @xmath0 is not @xmath3-positive when @xmath1 consists of the edges @xmath73 . on the other hand , we guess ( conjecture [ conj : hypertreeconjecture ] ) that the primality condition is not necessary for @xmath3-positivity , although our proof relies on primality in a crucial way . </S>",

    "<S> this in itself is not enough to show @xmath3-positivity for other chromatic symmetric functions of hypergraphs . </S>",
