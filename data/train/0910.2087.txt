    "the main purpose of this paper is to give general ideas on a kind of singular perturbations arising in thin shell theory when the middle surface is elliptic and the shell is fixed by a part of the boundary and free by the rest as well as an integral heuristic procedure reducing them to simpler problems .",
    "the system depends drastically on the parameter @xmath0 equal to the relative thickness of the shell .",
    "it appears that the `` limit problem '' for @xmath1 is highly ill - posed .",
    "indeed , the boundary conditions on the free boundary are not `` adapted '' to the system of equations ; they do not satisfy the shapiro - lopatinskii ( sl hereafter ) condition . roughly speaking ,",
    "this amounts to some kind of `` transparency '' of the boundary conditions , which allow some kind of locally indeterminate oscillations along the boundary , exponentially decreasing inside the domain .",
    "this pathological behavior is only concerned with @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath2 the problem is `` classical '' .",
    "when @xmath0 is positive but small , the `` determinacy '' of the oscillations only holds with the help of boundary conditions on other boundaries , as well as the small terms coming from @xmath2 .    in such kind of situations ,",
    "the limit problem has no solution within classical theory of partial differential equations , which is uses distribution theory .",
    "it is sometimes possible to prove the convergence of the solutions @xmath3 towards some limit @xmath4 , but this `` limit solution '' and the topology of the convergence are concerned with abstract spaces not included in the distribution space .    after recalling the sl condition ( section [ s2 ] ) ,",
    "we give in section [ s3 ] a very simple example of such a perturbation problem .",
    "the geometry of the domain ( an infinite strip ) allows explicit treatment by fourier transform in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the inverse fourier transform within distribution theory is only possible for @xmath2 , whereas for @xmath1 it is only possible in the framework of analytic functionals ( higly singular and not enjoying localization properties ) .",
    "this example shows the prominent role of components with high frequency ; for small @xmath0 , the `` smooth parts '' ( i. e. with small @xmath5 ) of the solutions may be neglected with respect to `` singular ones '' ( i. e. with large @xmath5 ) .",
    "we also recall an example of elliptic cauchy problem ( in fact hadamard s counter - example ) which exhibits some relation with the limit problem .    in section [ s4 ] ,",
    "we report the heuristic procedure of @xcite . in this latter article",
    ", we addressed a more complicated problem including a variational structure , somewhat analogous to the shell problem , but simpler , as concerning an equation instead of a system .",
    "it is shown that the limit problem contains in particular an elliptic cauchy problem .",
    "this problem was handled in both a rigorous ( very abstract ) framework and using a heuristic procedure for exhibiting the structure of the solutions with very small @xmath0 .",
    "the reasons why the solution goes out of the distibution space as @xmath0 goes to @xmath6 are then evident . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we present a simplified version of the heuristic procedure involving only the essential facts of the approximation , which are very much analogous to the method of construction of a parametrix in elliptic problems @xcite , @xcite :    -only principal ( with higher differentiation order ) terms are taken into account .",
    "-locally , the coefficients are considered to be constant , their values being frozen at the corresponding points .",
    "-after fourier transform ( @xmath7 ) , terms with small @xmath8 are neglected with respect to those with larger @xmath8 ( which amounts to taking into account singular parts of the solutions while neglecting smoother ones ) .",
    "we note that this approximation , aside with the two previous ones , lead to some kind of `` local fourier transform '' which we shall use freely in the sequel .",
    "another important ingredient of the heuristics is a previous drastic restriction of the space where the variational problem is handled . in order to search for the minimum of energy",
    ", we only take into account functions such that the energy of the limit problem is very small .",
    "this is done using a boundary layer method within the previous approximations , i. e. for large @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to an approximate simpler formulation of the problem for small @xmath0 , where it is apparent that the limit problem involves a smoothing operator and can not have a solution within distribution theory .",
    "it should prove useful to give an example of a sequence of functions converging to an analytical functional ( but going out of the distribution space , then leading to a `` complexification '' phenomenon ) .",
    "it is known ( @xcite , @xcite ) that ( direct and inverse ) fourier transform within distribution theory is only possible for temperate distributions , not allowing functions with exponential growth at infinity .",
    "the space of ( direct or inverse ) fourier transform of general distributions is noted @xmath9 . it is a space of analytical functionals",
    ": the corresponding test functions are analytical rapidly decreasing functions , forming the space z.    let us consider the ( non temperate ) distribution ( or function ) @xmath10 .",
    "the sequence @xmath11 converges to @xmath12 in the distribution sense as @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
    "the inverse fourier transforms @xmath14 converge in @xmath9 to the analytical functionnal @xmath15 .",
    "the functions @xmath16 are tempered and their inverse fourier transforms are easily computed by hand .",
    "it appears that for large @xmath13 @xmath17 it is then apparent that @xmath18 consists of a `` nearly periodic '' function with period tending to zero along with @xmath19 , multiplied by an `` envelop '' defined by @xmath20 and by the factor @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the amplitude is exponentially large with respect to the inverse of the period .",
    "it is then apparent that the limit is an `` extremely singular '' function as the `` graph '' fills the entire plane .",
    "moreover , it is clear ( and may be rigorously proved @xcite that the sequence @xmath22 goes out of the distribution space everywhere , not only in the vicinity of @xmath23 as is suggested by the formal inverse fourier transform of @xmath24 , which is @xmath25 apparently a singularity `` of order infinity '' at the origin .",
    "this fact constitutes an example of the property that elements of @xmath9 can only be tested with analytical test functions , then not enjoying localization properties .",
    "the motivation for studying that kind of problems comes from shell theory , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it appears that when the middle surface is elliptic ( both principal curvatures have same sign ) and is fixed by a part @xmath26 of the boundary and free by the rest @xmath27 , the `` limit problem '' as the thickness @xmath28 tends to zero is elliptic , with boundary conditions satisfying sl on @xmath26 , and boundary not satisfying sl on @xmath29 . without going into details , which may be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we show numerical computations taken from @xcite of the normal displacement for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( figures [ f1 ] on the left and on the right respectively ) when the shell is acted upon by a normal density of forces on a rectangular region of the plane of parameters .",
    "the most important feature is constituted by large oscillations nearby the free boundary @xmath27 .",
    "it is apparent that , when passing from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , the amplitude of the oscillations grows from 0.001 to 0.01 .",
    "the singularities produced by the jump of the applied forces inside the domain is still apparent for @xmath30 , not for @xmath32 , where only oscillations along the boundary are visible .",
    "moreover , the number of such oscillations pass from nearly 3 for @xmath33 to nearly 5 for @xmath32 and is then nearly proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "we shall see that all these features agree with our theory .",
    "on the left and for @xmath31 on the right , title=\"fig : \" ]   on the left and for @xmath31 on the right , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this section , we recall some properties of elliptic pde , see @xcite and @xcite for more details .",
    "we consider a pde of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and p is a polynomial of degree @xmath39 in @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the `` principal part '' , i. e. , the terms of higher order .",
    "the equation is said to be elliptic at @xmath42 if the homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath39 in @xmath43 : @xmath44 has no solution @xmath45 with real @xmath43 .",
    "when the coefficients are real ( this is the only case that we shall consider ) this implies that the degree is even ( this is the reason why we denoted it by @xmath39 ) . the left hand side of ( [ 2.2 ] )",
    "is said to be the `` principal symbol '' ; the `` symbol '' is obtained in an analogous way taking the whole @xmath46 instead of the principal part @xmath41 .",
    "we note that replacing @xmath47 by @xmath48 in @xmath41 amounts to taking formally the fourier transform @xmath49 for the homogeneous equation with constant coefficients obtained by discarding the lower order terms and freezing the coefficients at @xmath42 .",
    "obviously , ellipticity on a domain @xmath50 is defined as elliptic at any @xmath51 .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that ellipticity amounts to non - existence of `` travelling waves '' of the form @xmath52 for the equation obtained after discarding lower order terms and freezing coefficients . here",
    "`` travelling '' amounts to `` with real @xmath8 '' ; note that solutions as ( [ m2.3 ] ) with non real @xmath8 are necessarily exponentially growing or decaying ( in modulus ) in some direction .",
    "moreover , when a solution of the form ( [ m2.3 ] ) exists ( with @xmath8 either real or not ) , it also exists for @xmath53 with any @xmath54 . in a heuristic framework",
    ", we may suppose that @xmath5 is very large ; this justify to discard lower order terms (= of lower degree in @xmath5 ) .",
    "in the same ( heuristic ) order of ideas , freezing the coefficients allows to consider `` local solutions '' .",
    "this amounts to multiply the solutions by a `` cutoff '' function @xmath55 or equivalently taking the convolution of the fourier transform with @xmath56 , which do not modify the behavior for large @xmath8 .",
    "microlocal analysis gives a rigorous sense to that heuristics .",
    "it then appears that local singularities of a solution @xmath57 ( associated with behavior of the fourier transform for large @xmath58 can not occur in elliptic equations unless they are controlled by the ( fourier transform of the ) right hand side @xmath59 .",
    "this gives a `` heuristic proof '' of the classical property that local solutions of elliptic equations are rigorously associated with singularities of @xmath59 .    what happens with solutions near the boundary ?",
    "local fourier transform is no longer possible , but , after rectification of the boundary in the neighborhood of a point , we may perform a tangential fourier transform .",
    "if , for instance , the considered part of the boundary is on the axis @xmath60 and the domain is on the side @xmath61 , taking only higher order terms and frozen coefficients , we have solutions of the form ( [ m2.3 ] ) with real @xmath62 ( as coming from the fourier transform ) and non - real @xmath63 . the dependence in @xmath64 is immediately obtained by solving an ode with constant coefficients .",
    "obviously , the solutions are exponentially growing or decreasing for @xmath61",
    ". as the coefficients are real , there are precisely @xmath65 ( linearly independent ) growing and @xmath65 decreasing ( in the case of multiple roots , dependence in @xmath64 of the form @xmath66 and analogous also occur ) . roughly speaking , there are solutions of the form : @xmath67 with real @xmath62 and @xmath68 ( here @xmath69 is running from @xmath70 to @xmath39 ) .",
    "boundary conditions on @xmath71 should control solutions with @xmath72 , i. e. , exponentially decreasing inside the domain , whereas exponentially growing ones should be controlled `` by the equation in the rest of the domain and the boundary conditions on the other parts of the boundary '' .",
    "in other words , `` good boundary conditions '' should determine , ( within our approximation of the half plane and frozen coefficients ) the solutions of the equation of the form ( [ 2.4 ] ) with @xmath72 .",
    "obviously , the number of such boundary conditions is @xmath65 .",
    "a set of @xmath65 boundary conditions enjoying the above property is said to satisfy the shapiro - lopatinskii condition .",
    "there are several equivalent specific definitions of it .",
    "we shall mainly use the following one :    let @xmath46 be elliptic at a point @xmath73 of the boundary .",
    "a set of @xmath65 boundary conditions @xmath74 , @xmath75 is said to satisfy the sl condition at @xmath73 when , after a local change to new coordinates with origin at @xmath73 and axis @xmath60 tangent to the boundary , taking only the higher order terms and coefficients frozen at @xmath73 in the equation and the boundary conditions , the solutions of the form ( [ 2.4 ] ) with @xmath72 obtained by formal tangential fourier transform are well defined by the boundary conditions .",
    "the above definition should be understood in the sense of formal solution for any given ( real and non - zero ) @xmath62 .",
    "the sl condition is not concerned with solutions in certain spaces .",
    "it is purely algebraic , and concerns @xmath65 conditions imposed to the @xmath65 ( decreasing with @xmath64 ) linearly independent solutions of the ode obtained from @xmath41 by formal tangential fourier transform .",
    "this also amounts to saying that imposing the boundary conditions equal to zero , the considered solutions must vanish .",
    "in fact , the sl condition amounts to non - vanishing of a certain determinant , and as so it is generically satisfied : conditions not satisfying it are rarely encountered .",
    "in particular , in `` well - behaved problems '' , when coerciveness on appropriate spaces is proved , the sl condition is not usually checked .",
    "it should also be noted that the sl condition is independent of a change of variables , and , in most cases , the change is trivial . on the other hand , there are also definitions of the sl condition without change of variables .",
    "last , it should also be noted that the sl condition has nothing to do with lower order terms and the right hand side of the boundary conditions ( as ellipticity is only concerned with the principal symbol ) ; it is merely a condition of adequation of the principal part of the boundary operators to the principal part of the equation .",
    "let us consider , as an exercise , examples for the laplacian .",
    "@xmath76    the principal symbol is @xmath77 so that the equation is elliptic of order @xmath78 , then @xmath79 . `` good boundary conditions '' are in number of 1 .",
    "let us try the boundary condition ( dirichlet ) : @xmath80 taking any point of the boundary and @xmath81 with origin at that point , tangent and normal to the boundary respectively , the equation is the same as in the initial variables , and formal tangential fourier transform gives @xmath82    and the solutions are @xmath83 taking only the exponentially decreasing for @xmath61 we only have @xmath84 now , imposing the `` tangential fourier transform '' of ( [ 2.6 ] ) : @xmath85 we see that it vanish identically .",
    "then , the dirichlet boundary condition satisfies the sl condition for the laplacian .",
    "the case of the neumann boundary condition for the laplacian    @xmath86    is analogous .",
    "( note also that the fourier condition @xmath87 is the same , as only the higher order terms are taken in consideration ) .",
    "proceeding as before , we have , instead of ( [ 2.10 ] ) : @xmath88 which also gives @xmath89 and then @xmath90 .",
    "thus , ( [ 2.10 ] ) satisfies sl for ( [ 2.5 ] ) .",
    "oppositely , the boundary condition : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 denote the arc of the boundary and the normal , does not satisfy the sl condition for the laplacian . indeed , taking the new local axes ,",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 become @xmath60 and @xmath64 , and after tangential fourier transform : @xmath94 which , applied to ( [ 2.9 ] ) becomes : @xmath95 we then see that @xmath96 vanishes for negative @xmath62 , but is arbitrary for positive @xmath62 . in fact , the boundary condition ( [ 2.13 ] ) is `` transparent '' for solutions of the form ( [ 2.9 ] ) with positive @xmath62 .",
    "as it is apparent in the last example , when the sl condition is not satisfied , there is some kind of `` local non - uniqueness '' , where `` local '' recalls that only higher order terms are taken in consideration , and the coefficients are frozen at the considered point of the boundary .",
    "the sl condition appears as some previous condition for solving elliptic problems .",
    "it is apparent that some pathology is involved at points of the boundary where it is not satisfied .",
    "let us mention , before closing this section , that the boundary conditions may be different on different parts of the boundary specially on different connected components of it ( when there are points of junction of the various regions , usually singularities appear at that points ) .",
    "let @xmath50 be the strip @xmath97 of the ( @xmath98 plan .",
    "we denote by @xmath99 and @xmath100 the boundaries @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "we then consider the boundary value problem depending on the parameter @xmath0 : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the data of the problem .",
    "it is a given function of @xmath42 , that we shall suppose sufficiently smooth , tending to @xmath6 at infinity .",
    "we shall solve it by @xmath105 fourier transform ; it is easily seen that we also have automatically @xmath106 for @xmath107 , which may be added to the boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary condition on @xmath99 is the dirichlet one , which satisfies sl for the laplacian .",
    "oppositely , the boundary condition on @xmath100 satisfies it for @xmath108 ( this is easily checked ) , not at the limit @xmath109 ( see the end of the previous section ) .",
    "the problem is to solve for @xmath108 and to study the behavior for @xmath28 going to zero .",
    "denoting by @xmath110 the @xmath49 fourier transform , @xmath111 is defined on the same @xmath50 domain , but of the @xmath112 plane .",
    "the solutions of the ( transform of ) equation and the boundary condition on @xmath99 are of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes an unknown function to be determined with the boundary condition on @xmath100 .",
    "it will prove useful to write the solution under the form @xmath115 for the new unknown @xmath116 , which is the transform of the trace @xmath117 . imposing the fourier transform of the boundary condition on @xmath100 we have :    @xmath118    so that : @xmath119 in order to study this function",
    ", we should keep in mind that the expression @xmath120 decays for @xmath121 as @xmath122 . then , at the limit @xmath123 we have @xmath124 for @xmath121 this function behaves as @xmath125 this shows ( unless in the case of very special data @xmath104 with very fast decaying fourier transform ) that @xmath126 is not a tempered distribution , and the inverse fourier transform is an analytical function in @xmath127 . nevertheless , for @xmath128 , @xmath129 is `` well - behaved '' for @xmath130 as @xmath131 this specific behavior depends on that of @xmath132 , so that in most cases will be decreasing , but multiplied by the factor @xmath133 .",
    "when @xmath108 ( small but not @xmath6 ) is fixed , @xmath129 is approximatively given by ( [ 3.6 ] ) for `` finite '' @xmath134 and by ( [ 3.8 ] ) for @xmath134 going to @xmath135 .",
    "it is easily seen that the sup in modulus of @xmath136 is located in the region where both terms in the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ 3.5 ] ) are of the same order ( so that no one of them may ble neglected ) .",
    "this gives @xmath137    it appears that @xmath129 consists mainly of fourier components which tend to infinity algebraically as @xmath28 goes to zero with @xmath134 tending to infinite `` slowly '' as in ( [ 3.9 ] ) .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to the example , given in the introduction , of a sequence of functions converging to an analytical functional .",
    "coming back to ( [ 3.3 ] ) , the main properties of the behavior of @xmath138 may be thrown :    - the trace @xmath139 on the boundary @xmath100 which bears the `` pathological boundary condition '' mainly consists of large oscillations with wave length @xmath140 ( which tends to @xmath6 very slowly as @xmath141 ) .",
    "the amplitude of that oscillations grows nearly as @xmath142 .",
    "the limit @xmath141 does not exist in distribution theory ; it constitutes a complexification process .    - out of the trace on @xmath100 , ( i. e. for @xmath143 ) ,",
    "the behavior is analogous , but of lower amplitude , which is exponentially decreasing going away of @xmath100 .",
    "we recover properties of the non - uniqueness associated with the failed sl condition .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to show some analogy between the previous limit problem and the cauchy elliptic problem , which is a classical example of ill - posed problem , without solution in general .",
    "we consider the same domain @xmath50 as before , but we now impose two boundary conditions on @xmath99 and no condition on @xmath100 . namely @xmath144    taking as above the @xmath49 fourier transform , it follows immediately that @xmath145 where it is apparent that the behavior for @xmath146 is exponentially growing ( unless in the case when @xmath147 decays faster than @xmath148 ) so that it is not tempered and the inverse fourier transform does not exist within distribution theory .",
    "let @xmath149 be a two dimensional compact manifold with smooth ( of @xmath150 class ) boundary @xmath151 of the variable @xmath152 , where @xmath153 and @xmath27 are disjoint ; they are one - dimensional compact smooth manifolds without boundary , then diffeomorphic to the unit circle .",
    "let @xmath154 and @xmath155 be the bilinear forms given by : @xmath156 we consider the following variational problem ( which has possibly only a formal sense ) @xmath157 where the space @xmath158 is the `` energy space '' with the essential boundary conditions on @xmath26 @xmath159 where @xmath160 denotes the normal and tangent unit vectors to the boundary @xmath161 with the convention that the normal vector @xmath93 is inwards @xmath149 .",
    "it is easily checked that the bilinear form @xmath155 is coercive on @xmath158 .",
    "moreover , we immediately obtain the following result . for all @xmath108 and for all @xmath162 in @xmath163 ,",
    "the variational problem ( [ pbvar ] ) is of lax - milgram type and it is a self - adjoint problem which has a coerciveness constant larger than @xmath164 , with @xmath165 .",
    "the equation on @xmath50 associated with problem ( [ pbvar ] ) is : @xmath166 as both forms @xmath154 and @xmath155 give the laplacian . as for the boundary conditions on @xmath99 , they are `` principal '' i. e. they are included in the definition of @xmath158 , ( 5.4 ) . as for conditions on @xmath100 ,",
    "they are `` natural '' , classically obtained from the integrated terms by parts .",
    "those coming from the form @xmath155 are somewhat complicated ; we shall not write them , as the problem with @xmath2 is classical . for @xmath1",
    "these conditions ( coming from form @xmath154 ) are : @xmath167 .",
    "let us check that the boundary conditions on @xmath100 ( i. e ; the two last lines of ( 5.6 ) ) do not satisfy the sl condition for the elliptic operator @xmath169 .",
    "indeed , proceeding as in sect .",
    "2 , by formal tangential fourier transform      which yields that @xmath171 ( as well as analogous terms with @xmath172 instead of @xmath173 , which are not taken into account as exponentially growing inwards the domain ) . here , according to sl theory , @xmath64 is the coordinate normal to the boundary , after taking locally tangent and normal axes , ( which do not modify the equation @xmath169 ) .",
    "the ( tangential fourier transform of the ) boundary conditions on @xmath100 are : @xmath174 and @xmath175 it is immediately seen that the previous solutions ( [ bande1bis ] ) with @xmath176 and any @xmath177 satisfy both conditions ( note that its laplacian vanishes everywhere , then it vanishes as well as its normal derivative on the boundary ) .",
    "so , the sl condition is not satisfied on @xmath100 .    before going on with our study",
    ", we note that the limit problem ( [ pbvar3bis ] ) implies an elliptic cauchy problem for the auxiliary unknown @xmath178 indeed , system ( [ pbvar3bis ] ) gives in particular : @xmath179 which is precisely the cauchy problem for the laplacian .    as mentioned in section [ s3 ] , this is a classical ill - posed problem , and the solution does not exist in general .",
    "oppositely , uniqueness of the solution holds true ( uniqueness theorem of holmgren and analogous , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "from the general theory of singular perturbations of the form ( [ pbvar ] ) , we know that our assumption @xmath180 is crucial . indeed , when it is not satisfied , the problem is said to be `` non inhibited '' . in such a case",
    ", it has a kernel which contains non vanishing terms and then , it is easy to establish that the asymptotic behaviour of the solution @xmath181 of ( [ pbvar ] ) is described by a variational problem in this kernel .",
    "the previous fact is not surprising as soon as we consider the following minimization problem , which is equivalent to ( [ pbvar ] ) , @xmath182 indeed , when @xmath28 goes to zero , the natural trend consists in avoiding the @xmath154-energy which occurs with the factor @xmath70 and leaving the @xmath155-energy which has a factor @xmath183 .",
    "clearly , this is not possible when ( [ 3.1 ] ) is satisfied since the kernel reduces to the zero function .",
    "nevertheless , in our case , @xmath184 implies @xmath185 and , as @xmath186 , the traces of @xmath187 and @xmath188 vanish on @xmath26 , so that ( [ 3.1 ] ) follows from the uniqueness theorem for the cauchy problem .",
    "this uniqueness is classical , but the solution @xmath57 is unstable in the sense that there can be `` large @xmath57 '' in the @xmath158 norm ( or in other spaces ) for `` small @xmath59 '' in the @xmath189 norm ( or in other spaces ) .",
    "it then appears that the same reasoning shows that for small values of @xmath28 , the solution @xmath181 will be precisely among elements with small @xmath190 , that is to say with small @xmath191 in @xmath192 .",
    "let us now build such functions @xmath193 with very small@xmath194 .",
    "the main idea is to consider functions in a larger space than the space of functions @xmath187 of @xmath158 such that @xmath195 ( which only contains the function @xmath196 ) . the functions of this bigger space will not satisfy the two boundary conditions on @xmath153 that are satisfied by any function of @xmath158",
    ". then we shall modify it in a narrow boundary layer along @xmath26 in order to satisfy the two boundary conditions with small value of @xmath154-energy .",
    "we observe that every function of @xmath198 satisfies one of the boundary conditions on @xmath26 which are satisfied by any element of @xmath158 . for simplicity",
    ", we have chosen @xmath196 on @xmath199 , but we could choose the other one @xmath200 on @xmath26 as well . on the other hand ,",
    "the regularity assumption @xmath150 is slightly arbitrary . since",
    ", we will consider the completion of @xmath198 with respect to some norm , this point is irrelevant .",
    "obviously , as the dirichlet problem for the laplacian on @xmath149 is well posed in @xmath150 , the space @xmath198 is isomorphic with the space of traces on @xmath27 : @xmath201 the isomorphism is obtained by solving the dirichlet problem : @xmath202      in fact , the exact function @xmath3 is a solution of ( [ pbfor ] ) , which we are searching to describe approximatively in order to define a space as small as possible ( incorporating the main features of the solution ) to solve the minimization problem .",
    "more precisely , according to our previous comments , we are interested in the `` most singular parts '' of @xmath3 in the sense of the part corresponding to the high frequency fourier components .",
    "as we shall see in the sequel , it turns out that these singular parts may be obtained by modification of the functions @xmath206 on a boundary layer close to @xmath99 ; this layer is narrower when the considered fourier components are of higher frequency ; in fact , the layer only exists because we only consider high frequencies .",
    "this allows to make an approximation which consists in using locally curvilinear coordinates defined by the arc of @xmath99 and the normal , and handling them as cartesian coordinates .",
    "clearly , this approximation is exact only on the very @xmath99 , but more and more precise as we approach of @xmath99 , i. e. as the considered frequencies grow .",
    "once the layer is constructed , we compute the @xmath154-energy of it , as well as the @xmath207-energy of the ( modified ) @xmath206 function , in order to consider the variational problem ( [ pbvar ] ) in the restricted space .",
    "let us first exhibit the local structure of the fourier transform of @xmath206 close to @xmath99 . according to our general considerations on the heuristic procedure ,",
    "@xmath208 may be considered ( after multiplying by an appropriate cutoff function ) of `` small support '' near a point @xmath209 of @xmath26 .",
    "taking local tangent and normal cartesian coordinates @xmath210 , we have , within our approximation , @xmath211 for some @xmath212 . taking the tangential fourier transform ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath213 it is worthwhile defining the local structure of @xmath208 in the vicinity of @xmath99 using the `` cauchy '' data @xmath206 and @xmath214 on @xmath99 ( note that the solution of the cauchy problem is unique , so that the cauchy data determine the solution ) . as @xmath208 vanishes on @xmath99 , the local structure",
    "is then determined by @xmath214 on @xmath99 .",
    "taking the tangential fourier transform this gives : @xmath215    we now proceed to the modification of @xmath216 into @xmath217 in a narrow boundary layer of @xmath26 in order to satisfy ( always within our approximation ) the equation coming from ( [ pbfor ] ) for small @xmath28 .",
    "using considerations similar to those leading to ( [ approx ] ) , this amounts to @xmath218 hence the tangential fourier transform reads @xmath219      the four unknown constants should be determined by imposing that @xmath222 and @xmath223 vanish for @xmath224 and the `` matching condition '' of the layer , i.e. , out of the layer , we want @xmath225 to match with the given function @xmath226 . since @xmath227 , then @xmath228 means that @xmath229 ( but we still impose that @xmath230 is small in order to be in a narrow layer of @xmath26 ) ; this is perfectly consistent , as we will only use the functions for large @xmath231 , hence the terms with coefficients @xmath232 and @xmath233 are `` boundary layer terms '' going to zero out of the layer ( i.e. for @xmath234 ) , see perhaps @xcite or @xcite for generalities on boundary layers and matching .",
    "this gives @xmath235      defining on @xmath99 the family ( with parameter @xmath238 ) of pseudo - differential smoothing operators @xmath239 with symbol : @xmath240 where @xmath241 is an irrelevant cutoff function avoiding low frequencies ; it is equal to 1 for high frequencies ( see @xcite for details ) , we see that the modification of the function @xmath216 : @xmath242 is precisely the action of @xmath239 on @xmath243 : @xmath244      let @xmath246 and @xmath206 be two elements in @xmath247 and @xmath248 the corresponding elements modified in the boundary layer . as the given",
    "@xmath246 and @xmath206 are harmonic in @xmath149 , the @xmath154-form is only concerned with the modification terms @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "then , within our approximation , we have : @xmath251    to compute this expression , we first write @xmath246 and @xmath206 as sum of terms with `` small support '' ( by multiplying by a partition of unity ) : @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "then , within our approximation , the integral is on the halfplane @xmath254 of the variables @xmath255 . taking the tangential fourier transform and using the parceval - plancherel theorem , we have @xmath256 hence , on account of ( [ v5 ] ) and integrating in @xmath230 , this yields @xmath257            we now consider the minimization problem ( [ pbmin ] ) on @xmath198 instead of on @xmath158 .",
    "obviously , the @xmath154-energy should be computed using formula ( [ energiea3bis ] ) .",
    "this modified problem should involve the @xmath154-energy and the @xmath207-energy . a natural space for handling it should be the completion @xmath265 of @xmath198 with the norm : @xmath266      it will prove useful to write another ( asymptotically equivalent for large @xmath269 ) definition of this problem .",
    "indeed , the elements @xmath206 of @xmath198 ( and then of @xmath265 ) may be identified ( by solving the problem ( [ pbdirichlet ] ) ) with their traces @xmath205 on @xmath100 . moreover , as the functions @xmath206 are harmonic , we may exhibit their local behavior in the vicinity of any point @xmath270 . proceeding as in ( [ approx ] ) , ( [ solmodifie2 ] ) and taking only the decreasing exponential towards the domain ( this is the classical approximation for the construction of a parametrix ) we have : @xmath271 where @xmath210 are the tangent and the normal ( inwards the domain ) vectors .",
    "then , it is apparent that the @xmath155-energy is concentrated in a layer close to @xmath27 and we may compute it in an analogous way to the calculus that was done for the @xmath154-energy ( [ energiea3bis ] ) .",
    "indeed , using parseval - plancherel theorem and within our approximation , we have @xmath272 hence , recalling ( [ fouriertangentiel ] ) and integrating over @xmath230 , we get : @xmath273    then , defining the pseudo - differential operator @xmath274 of order @xmath275 with principal symbol @xmath276 or equivalently as previously : @xmath277 we have ( always within our approximation ) : @xmath278          in order to exhibit more clearly the unusual character of the problem , we shall now write ( [ pblaxasymptotic2 ] ) under another equivalent form involving only the traces on @xmath100 . coming back to ( [ pbdirichlet ] ) , let us define @xmath281 as follows . for a given @xmath282 we solve ( [ pbdirichlet ] ) and we take the trace of @xmath283 on @xmath26 , then @xmath284    using the regularity properties of the solution of ( [ pbdirichlet ] ) , it follows that @xmath285 is in @xmath286 .",
    "in fact , @xmath287 is a smoothing operator , sending any distribution into a @xmath288 function .",
    "then , ( [ pblaxasymptotic2 ] ) may be written as a problem for the traces on @xmath27 : @xmath289 where the configuration space is obviously @xmath290 .",
    "the left hand side with @xmath108 is continuous and coercive .",
    "we then define the new operators @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the adjoint of @xmath281 ( which is also smoothing ) ) , ( [ pblaxasymptotic3 ] ) becomes @xmath293 obviously , @xmath294 is an elliptic pseudo - differential operator of order 3 , whereas @xmath295 is a smoothing ( non local ) operator .",
    "this problem is somewhat simpler than the initial one ( as on a manifold of dimension 1 ) , showing the interest of the formal asymptotics .",
    "it enters in a class of sensitive problems addressed in @xcite section 2 .",
    "it is apparent that the limit problem ( for @xmath109 ) has no solution in the distribution space for any @xmath296 not contained in @xmath297 .",
    "indeed , on the compact manifold @xmath26 , any distribution is in some @xmath298 space , which is send into @xmath297 by the smoothing operator @xmath295 .",
    "[ dernierrajout1 ] the drastically non local character of the smoothing operator @xmath295 follows from the fact that it involves @xmath299 and @xmath300 ( see([defder ] ) ) .",
    "this is the reason why the problem may be reduced to another one on the traces on @xmath100 .",
    "the possibility of that reduction is a consequence of our approximation , where the configuration space is formed by harmonic functions .",
