    "the first radiation zeros were discovered as a consequence of a general investigation  @xcite of the production of electroweak pairs in hadronic collisions @xmath0 and neutrino reactions @xmath1 addressed to very - high - energy cosmic - ray physics .",
    "the investigation probed the sensitivity of these reactions to the trilinear gauge boson couplings and , at the present time , useful limits on their deviations from gauge theory predictions have been obtained in @xmath2 and hadron collider experiments @xcite .",
    "pronounced dips were found  @xcite in the angular distributions for the production of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the two - body parton and lepton reactions .",
    "subsequent work  @xcite by mikaelian , samuel , and sahdev proved that the @xmath3 dips were in fact exact zeros at particular angles , which would be ruined by non - gauge couplings .",
    "the wisconsin brain trust  @xcite followed with a general demonstration of the implied amplitude factorization .",
    "since it is so easy to do so , we show how a radiation zero arises in lowest - order radiative charged - scalar fusion @xmath5 whose feynman diagrams lead to the born amplitude @xmath6 with charges @xmath7 , four - momenta @xmath8 , and photon momentum @xmath9 and polarization @xmath10 .",
    "( the trilinear scalar coupling is taken to be unity . ) using momentum conservation , we observe that @xmath11 if all @xmath12 are the same .",
    "this is exactly the same condition found for the @xmath3 amplitude , independent of the spins .",
    "it leads to a zero when @xmath13 for the center - of - mass angle @xmath14 of particle 3 relative to the direction of particle  1 ( or between the photon and particle  2 ) .",
    "this reduces to @xmath15 for @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "faced with the vanishing of the above amplitudes , brodsky asserted that the way to look at these zeros was as the complete destructive interference of classical radiation patterns . following this lead , and making a long story short ( see the longer story with better referencing in  @xcite ) , an arbitrary number @xmath18 of external charged particles was considered and a general set of radiation interference theorems were found  @xcite . again considering the emission of a photon with momentum @xmath9 , the tree amplitude approximation vanishes , independent of any particle s spin @xmath19 , for common charge - to - light - cone - energy ratios ( the radiation null zone ) , @xmath20 where the @xmath21 particle has electric charge @xmath7 and four - momentum @xmath8 .",
    "all couplings must be prescribed by local gauge theory .",
    "we see why it took so long to discover radiation zeros since the first null zone requirement is that all charges must have the same sign .",
    "fractionally charged quarks and weak bosons are needed in order to get three things : same - sign charges , a process well - approximated by a born amplitude , and a four - particle reaction so the null zone was simple .",
    "while there are zeros associated with any gauge group when the corresponding massless gauge bosons are emitted , in qcd , color charges are averaged or summed over in hadronic reactions . in thinking of the weak bosons themselves ,",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken and nonzero weak - boson masses ruin radiation interference .",
    "what about other photonic zeros ? the zero in electron - electron bremsstrahlung is less interesting .",
    "zeros in electron - quark and quark - antiquark bremsstrahlung require jet identification along with the more complicated phase space  @xcite . while we shall say more about other tests , we find ourselves returning again and again to the original @xmath3 zero .",
    "there are various corrections that turn the @xmath3 zero into a dip . theoretically , higher - order ( closed - loop )",
    "corrections will not vanish in the null zone , since the internal loop momenta can not be fixed .",
    "structure function effects , higher order qcd corrections , finite @xmath23 width effects , and photon radiation from the final state lepton line all tend to fill in the dip .",
    "the main complication in the extraction of the @xmath24 distribution in @xmath3 production , however , originates from the finite resolution of the detector and ambiguities in reconstructing the parton center of mass frame .",
    "the ambiguities are associated with the nonobservation of the neutrino arising from @xmath23 decay . identifying the missing transverse momentum , @xmath25 , with the transverse momentum of the neutrino of a given @xmath3 event ,",
    "the unobservable longitudinal neutrino momentum , @xmath26 , and thus the parton center of mass frame , can be reconstructed by imposing the constraint that the neutrino and charged lepton four momenta combine to form the @xmath23 rest mass .",
    "the resulting quadratic equation , in general , has two solutions . in the approximation of a zero @xmath23-decay width ,",
    "one of the two solutions coincides with the true @xmath26 . on an event by event basis , however , it is impossible to tell which of the two solutions is the correct one .",
    "this ambiguity considerably smears out the dip caused by the amplitude zero .",
    "problems associated with the reconstruction of the parton center of mass frame could be avoided by considering hadronic @xmath23 decays . the horrendous qcd background",
    ", however , renders this channel useless .",
    "at present there is only a preliminary study by the cdf collaboration of the @xmath24 distribution  @xcite from a partial data sample of the 1992 - 95 tevatron run .",
    "the event rate is still insufficient to make a statistically significant statement about the existence of the radiation zero .",
    "one can at best say that `` there is a hint of gauge zero '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourteen2 ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      +    a)7.cm b )",
    "the radiation zeros are the generalization of the well - known vanishing of classical non - relativistic electric and magnetic dipole radiation occurring for equal charge / mass ratios ( indeed , the low - energy limit of the null zone conditions ) and equal gyro - magnetic g - factors .",
    "the null zone is exactly the same as that for the completely destructive interference of radiation by charge lines ( a classical convection current calculation@xcite ) and is preserved by the fully relativistic quantum born approximation for gauge theories .",
    "stan brodsky has long emphasized the magic of the gyro - magnetic ratio value @xmath27 predicted by gauge theory for spinor and vector particles . only for this value",
    "will born amplitudes have the same null zone as the classical radiation patterns for soft photons . and only for this value",
    "will born amplitudes have good high - energy behavior . in this way we have a connection between the large and small distance scales , with the value @xmath27 as a bridge .",
    "it is great to have this chance to acknowledge stan brodsky s unique leadership and collaboration in these radiation matters .",

    "<S> the key experimental interest is that this will not occur in any deviation from the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> second , the classical training of stanley brodsky began sixty years ago , which was instrumental in understanding why theoretical spin - independent radiation zeros appear in almost all born amplitudes for the radiation of photons and gluons and other massless gauge bosons ( but rarely in physical kinematic regions ) . and there are approximate zeros for massive bosons and `` type ii '' zeros that can also be studied . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the difficulties in observing the original mikaelian - samuel - sahdev zero finally may be surmounted next year .    </S>"
