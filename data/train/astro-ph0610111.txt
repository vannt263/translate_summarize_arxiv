    "a number of complex hydrodynamic processes takes place in the atmospheres of cool a stars ( @xmath1=75008000  k ) .",
    "convection is arguably the least understood phenomenon , as it presents enormous challenges both for observational detection and theoretical modelling .",
    "the atmospheric structure of cool a stars is thought to be close to radiative equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , prominent signatures of convective motions are observed in several classes of slowly rotating a - type stars .",
    "for instance , for am stars inexplicably broad profiles of strong line are observed .",
    "large microturbulent velocity is often deduced in 1-d model atmosphere analyses and line bisectors show blue asymmetry ( landstreet @xcite ) , which is opposite to the behaviour of the solar - type stars . in cool magnetic ap stars macroturbulence of @xmath210  kms@xmath3is required to reproduce the width of rare - earth lines formed in the upper atmospheric layers ( kochukhov & ryabchikova @xcite ) , suggesting that turbulence is not fully suppressed even in the presence of strong ordered magnetic field .",
    "these observations indicate that convection is important for the atmospheric dynamics of a - type stars .",
    "3-d hydrodynamic simulations of convection in a stars are considerably more difficult compared to similar modelling of the solar - type stars .",
    "short radiative time - scales limit the time step of simulation and thus require 10 to 100 more computing time for an a - type star compared to the corresponding simulation of the solar - type granulation .",
    "furthermore , simulations need to resolve the steep temperature jump below the photosphere and have to cover simultaneously the small surface granules and the large deep cells .    here",
    "we develop further the 3-d a - star model of freytag & steffen ( @xcite ) and present first results of the new study that has finally overcome computational problems associated with simulating the a - star convection zone .",
    "we have used the co@xmath0bold  code ( freytag @xcite , wedemeyer et al .",
    "@xcite ) to perform 3-d simulations of the surface convection zone in a main sequence a - type star ( @xmath4  k , @xmath5 ) . for solving hydrodynamics equations co@xmath0bold  employs conservative finite volume approach .",
    "3-d radiation transport is based on a modified feautrier scheme using long characteristics .",
    "we use grey or wavelength dependent opacities derived from atlas6 opacity distribution functions .",
    "simulations are carried out in cartesian geometry , assuming periodic lateral boundary conditions .",
    "top and bottom boundaries are closed for flows and transparent for radiation . @xmath6",
    "grid points are used , corresponding to the simulation box with size @xmath7  mm .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the typical surface granulation pattern and the vertical structure of the velocity field deduced with co@xmath0bold .",
    "the dashed line shows 1-d spectrum synthesis using microturbulence @xmath8  kms@xmath3  and no macroturbulent or rotational broadening.,width=181 ]    a new 3-d spectrum synthesis code ( piskunov , in preparation ) was used to compute line profiles from the co@xmath0bold  snapshots . for a - star models we used the lte source function and computed line and continuum opacities as in 1-d synth code by piskunov ( @xcite ) .",
    "radiative transfer is solved with a short characteristic formal solver based on the quadratic bezier - spline approximation of the source function .",
    "the flux spectra are produced from the intensity profiles computed for 29 directions .",
    "we compared our theoretical spectra with the high - resolution observations of the slowly rotating a2 m star hr  4750 ( @xmath9  k , @xmath10 , landstreet @xcite ) .",
    "a set of fe and cr spectral lines in the 46124645    wavelength region was synthesized , adopting chemical abundances , stellar and atomic parameters from landstreet ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] presents a comparison of observations and 3-d spectrum synthesis for selected spectral lines .",
    "our 3-d model reproduces the line cores of strong spectral features , but fails to fit the observed wide wings and strong blueward asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "weak lines are successfully reproduced .",
    "in contrast to the solar - type stars , bisectors computed for our 3-d hydrodynamic models of a stars are not skewed to the red . in our calculations , the resulting bisectors span a small velocity range and have a weak blue asymmetry in the outer wings  a trend which agrees with observations .",
    "we have carried out 3-d numerical simulations of the a - star convection zone using the radiation hydrodynamics code co@xmath0bold .",
    "these are the first 3-d rhd calculations for a stars which employ non - grey opacities .",
    "the granulation pattern predicted for a stars appears to be generally similar to the one found in the solar - type stars , albeit with some distinctive features ( bright rims of granules , large horizontal velocity component ) .",
    "comparison of the detailed 3-d spectrum synthesis with co@xmath0bold  snapshots and high - resolution observations shows that our 3-d model successfully reproduces the shape of weak lines in the am star hr  4750 .",
    "this is the first time when a 3-d rhd model is able to fit the a - star line profiles without introducing fudge line broadening parameters .",
    "theoretical models fail to reproduce the broad wings and prominent blueward asymmetry observed in the strong spectral lines , indicating that further improvements ( realistic abundances , better resolution ) of 3-d models are required .",
