    "the dynamical jahn - teller ( djt ) effect , where one degenerate electronic level is nontrivially coupled to vibrational modes , represents perhaps the simplest type of problem where the born - oppenheimer approximation is invalid in principle , and a quantum mechanical treatment of the full electron - ion system is essential . even for the simplest djt case ,",
    "true closed - form solutions have only been obtained for a restricted set of coupling values@xcite . in spite of that",
    ", the djt physics of a _ single _ vibrational mode coupled to the electronic state is quite well understood@xcite for all known symmetries , through analytic expansions valid in the opposite limits of strong and weak coupling , and otherwise through numerical diagonalization for intermediate values of the coupling . in a large number of cases of practical interest there are however _ many _ vibrational modes , coupled simultaneously to the same degenerate electronic state .",
    "this many - modes case has been extensively studied theoretically@xcite . in particular",
    ", a first group of studies considers in detail the case of an impurity - related localized degenerate level interacting with the continuum of phonons in a crystal@xcite , while a second class of studies concentrates on the case of a finite , discrete set of vibrational modes@xcite . in the present paper we revisit the second type of problem , having in mind in particular the case of an isolated molecule / cluster / ion with a finite ( although possibly large ) number @xmath2 of vibrational modes participating .    to begin with , we recall the two special limits in which the many - modes problem is trivially solved@xcite .",
    "first , the case of all modes having the same symmetry and frequency , is simply reduced , by means of a rotation in the vibrational space , to the equivalent problem of a single mode coupled with the total coupling intensity , plus @xmath5 uncoupled modes .",
    "secondly , in the weak - coupling limit , degenerate perturbation theory applies , and contributions from different modes linearly superpose .",
    "intermode interactions appear only at fourth and higher order in the couplings .",
    "the more realistic case of many modes with the same symmetry and different frequencies and couplings was apparently first addressed systematically by obrien@xcite in the other customary limit , i.e. , the strong - coupling semiclassic expansion .",
    "her approach relies on the concept of replacing the @xmath2 real modes with a single effective mode , perturbed by weak residual off - diagonal contributions . in this way",
    "one obtains an approximation which has been very useful , notably@xcite in the calculation of spectral shapes and reduction factors .",
    "nonetheless , as we will show below , there is no well - defined limiting case where that approximation become exact in a controlled manner , except for the equal - frequency case .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate an alternative approach , which is exact in the semiclassical ( strong e - v coupling ) limit , and applicable from strong to intermediate couplings .",
    "rather than working in general , we address directly two specific and physically important cases of many - modes djt , namely the linear @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "our method relies on a detailed analysis of the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential surface around its minimum , and of the normal frequencies of the classical small oscillations of the e - v coupled system .",
    "these frequencies , in turn , determine residual zero - point quantum correction to the classical motion on the bo surface .",
    "comparison with the effective - mode approach@xcite reveals that the latter , not taking into account these corrections , contains a systematic deviation in the strong - coupling limit , which we discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ numerical : sect ] .",
    "inclusion of these corrections generates the leading term of the exact strong - coupling expansion of the jt energy gain as a function of inverse coupling ( eq .  ( [ emmodes : eqn ] ) ) . as a very useful byproduct",
    ", we also obtain a detailed description of the low - energy vibronic spectrum , which is again accurate in the strong coupling limit .",
    "finally , in order to provide a numerical application , we deliberately choose in sec .",
    "[ txh : sect ] a borderline case of intermediate coupling , namely the negative ion of c@xmath7 .",
    "that is a @xmath1 djt problem , with @xmath8 , for which both exact and effective mode alternative calculations are feasible . due to intermediate coupling , our approximation will not , of course , be particularly accurate .",
    "nonetheless , being able to judge the sign and size of the deviation is especially useful in assessing errors , particularly in a case like this , which stretches a little beyond the reasonable borders of validity .",
    "we consider first the @xmath9 linear jt hamiltonian , a basic textbook@xcite example of djt , as well as a relevant model in many molecules and crystals . for convenience",
    ", we shall adopt the notations of ref .",
    "the hamiltonian operator for the @xmath2-modes problem is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the frequency and @xmath12 is the dimensionless coupling strength of the twofold - degenerate mode @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is a vector notation for the two normal coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 of mode @xmath13 , and @xmath17 are the corresponding conjugate momenta . @xmath18 and @xmath19 label the two degenerate electronic states .",
    "the sums should be understood as @xmath20 .",
    "note that we use the second - quantized notation for the fermions , and the coordinate description for the vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "we also set @xmath21 , thus making no distinctions between ( angular ) frequencies and energies .",
    "as a first step , we treat the @xmath14 as classical coordinates , and study the ( lowest ) born - oppenheimer potential surface : @xmath22 the minimum over the fermionic degree of freedom @xmath23 is the lowest eigenvalue of the 2@xmath242 electronic problem representing one fermion in the degenerate level , which is @xmath25 .",
    "the lowest bo surface is conveniently rewritten in polar coordinates @xmath26 as @xmath27 in this form , the minima of @xmath28 , corresponding to the classical stable equilibrium configurations of the system , are straightforwardly discussed . in order to minimize @xmath28 , the argument of the square root should be maximum , which is obtained when all @xmath29 simultaneously vanish . in this case , for all cosines equal to one , the square root can be explicitly executed , to obtain separate dependences on the different @xmath30 s .",
    "the minimum of @xmath28 is therefore obtained for @xmath31 where @xmath32 is arbitrary . as form ( [ bopot : eqn ] ) explicitly shows , the potential energy is independent of the common rotation angle @xmath33 .",
    "this implies in particular that the configurations of minimum potential energy constitute a continuous manifold , parametrized by @xmath32 , with the topology of a circle , exactly the same as in the one - mode problem .",
    "this result was to be expected also on the basis of more abstract considerations @xcite , and we shall return to it below , when analyzing the small oscillations around the minimum .    the value of the potential at the minimum is the classical jt energy gain @xmath34 where we have introduced , following ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this was just a re - derivation of well - known results .",
    "the next step is to compute the quantum corrections to this classical result .",
    "the quantum corrections add to @xmath37 in the form of a strong - coupling expansion in negative powers of @xmath38 .",
    "the leading term , of order zero , is a shift independent of @xmath38 , due to the change of zero - point energy of the system following the jt coupling .",
    "this is most easily illustrated in the case of just one mode .",
    "the ground - state energy of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian : eqn ] ) , @xmath39 ( no jt coupling ) , is just the zero - point energy of the ( two - fold degenerate ) mode , amounting to @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the coupling is very strong , the dynamics factorizes into a radial harmonic mode plus a free pseudo - rotation .",
    "the harmonic zero - point energy is now only @xmath41 .",
    "for a single mode , the total jt energy gain is therefore , as is well known , @xmath42 where @xmath43 term represents the lowering of the bo potential minimum , @xmath44 representing the zero - point energy gain , and the @xmath45 for the ground state ) term is the residual zero - point energy associated with quantization of the ( pseudo - rotational ) @xmath32 motion . in the rest of this section we wish to generalize the second and third term in eq .",
    "( [ e1mode : eqn ] ) to the many - modes case .",
    "we now extend this kind of semiclassical expansion to the many - modes case .",

    "the kinetic energy for these coordinates is @xmath51 where @xmath52 the normal frequencies @xmath53 and vibronic modes are obtained as eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix    @xmath54    this matrix is non hermitian , but has real eigenvalues .",
    "the block - diagonal form shows that the small oscillations of the radial and angular variables are uncoupled .",

    "the frequencies @xmath66 display the same behavior in the general case : the new modes @xmath66 are located in the intervals between neighboring frequencies @xmath75 , @xmath61 , attracted towards the mode with _ weaker _ coupling strength @xmath62 . in the limiting case @xmath76 , therefore , @xmath66 restores smoothly the twofold - degeneracy of the uncoupled mode @xmath61 . for a point impurity coupled to the phonon continuum , equations analogous to eq .",
    "( [ angfreq : eqn ] ) were derived earlier@xcite , but apparently not put to practical use .",
    "here , we will use our eigenvalue equation ( [ angfreq : eqn ] ) for the calculation of vibron frequencies , and of the associated zero - point energy .",
    "we underline , incidentally , that this equation has a very familiar form , namely that of a slater - koster scattering problem for a separable potential , or of a collective - mode equation@xcite , or of a bcs gap equation@xcite . by coupling to the same electronic state ,",
    "the different vibrational modes get effectively coupled to each other by a kind of separable `` attractive @xmath77-function '' potential .",

    "broken gauge invariance and goldstone s theorem give rise to a formally similar sum rule . a universal feature of linear jt systems ,",
    "the zero mode is also present in the phonon continuum case@xcite .    in the evaluation of the zero - point energy , the normal angular frequencies appear only as a sum : @xmath79 this main result is not in `` closed form '' , since the @xmath66 are defined implicitly as the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ angfreq : eqn ] ) .",
    "however this is a very marginal shortcoming , involving in each specific case the simple solution of a numerical equation , explicitly given in terms of the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we also remark that a rescaling of all the couplings @xmath80 brings no change to the secular equation ( [ secular : eqn ] ) : the angular frequencies @xmath66 , therefore , do not depend on @xmath38 , but only on the ratios among the couplings . thus , in particular , the @xmath81 zero - point term is really a term of order zero in @xmath38 , as it should .",
    "this approach provides quite naturally the detailed structure of the spectrum of the excited states in the strong - coupling many - modes case .",

    "this shift , for given frequencies and ratios among the couplings , is independent of @xmath38 , therefore the inclusion of higher power corrections in @xmath116 to eq .",
    "( [ emmobrien : eqn ] ) , such as those of eq .  ( 44 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite can not correct the asymptotic behavior at large @xmath38 .",
    "we have introduced a semiclassical treatment of the many - modes problem , which corrects the difficulties of the effective - mode model .",
    "we have applied this method to two specific jt cases making it clear that , with straightforward modifications , it can be extended to other djt systems .",
    "the method is based on the approximate calculation of the new vibron normal mode frequencies @xmath111 arising after djt coupling . of these modes ,",
    "@xmath5 fall in the intervals between successive original bare mode frequencies , the remaining one is a zero mode @xmath63 .",
    "the approximate @xmath111 s are again solutions of a collective - mode ",
    "type equation@xcite , already obtained in an equivalent form in previous studies of the continuum case@xcite .",
    "numerical tests confirm this picture , including the recovery of the original , _ unperturbed _ frequencies @xmath11 s in the strong - coupling spectrum .",
    "in particular , we obtain expressions ( [ emmodes : eqn],[emmodest : eqn ] ) , in terms of these frequencies , for the ground - state energy which are exact in the strong - coupling limit . at finite coupling ,",
    "our formulas introduce an error of the order @xmath105 , which is only partly corrected by the term eqs.([erot : eqn]),([erott : eqn ] ) of pseudorotation along the bo minimum trough with the associated berry phase constraints@xcite .",
    "however , in cases with strong enough coupling for our expansion to hold for the potential , the expressions to order @xmath173 gives satisfactory results , and will not need further refinement .",
    "we provide ample numerical verification for our expectations in the @xmath0 case",
    ". a detailed numerical test of the result for the case of @xmath1 would be rather difficult , because of the explosion of the basis set size , which occurs when many vibron states are included , as necessary at strong coupling .",
    "the case of c@xmath4 , not a very strongly - coupled system , therefore amenable to exact diagonalization , shows that our approach provides results for the energy gain which are basically equivalent to those of the effective - mode approximation .",
    "more interesting would be a direct experimental confirmation of the new vibron frequencies which we have found .",
    "the ideal test system could be a molecular system where the couplings to a few ( 2 or 3 ) modes are known , reasonably strong , controlled , and possibly switchable on and off ( for example upon doping ) : in such a situation , infrared / raman spectroscopy should easily evidence the birth of new modes .",
    "benzenoid cations might represent a suitable systems for such future investigations .",
    "the present formulation of course neglects a large set of effects potentially capable of modifying the picture to some degree , especially on the low- and high - energy ends of the vibronic spectra .",
    "the most obvious limitation regards the assumed harmonicity of the `` small oscillations '' ( [ bopot : eqn ] ) , and the neglect from the beginning of nonlinear terms in ( [ hamiltonian : eqn ] ) .",
    "in fact , there is no truly flat jt valley in a real system .",
    "the effect of valley warping is to localize the pseudorotational motion into a discrete set of minima .",
    "the importance of this phenomenon is determined by the relative value of the pseudorotational energy @xmath174 and the height of the barriers between minima .",
    "initially the warping will affect mostly the zero - energy mode , but for very large jt distortions , the whole shape of the bo surface will change . as a consequence ,",
    "our results apply best to a strong - coupling case where the large value of @xmath38 is given by the addition of many individually small contributions @xmath12 , such that the distortion of each mode s coordinate remains small , and the effect of higher - order terms is therefore weak .",
    "we are thankful to paolo de los rios and fabio pistolesi for useful discussions .",
