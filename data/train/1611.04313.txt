    "the measurement of the @xmath2-dependence of the total cross sections @xmath3 and of @xmath4 @xmath5 the ratio of the real part to the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath5 is very important @xcite as it is a test of the first principles of quantum field theory .",
    "these principles lead to the integral dispersion relations that relate the real and the imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath6 .",

    "hence , in theory , the scattering amplitude has to satisfy analyticity in the mandelstam representation , and the real part of the scattering amplitude must be derivable from the imaginary part @xcite",
    ".    for simplicity one often uses the local or derivative dispersion relations ( see for example @xcite ) to determine the real part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "for example the compete collaboration used , for @xmath9 part of the amplitude @xcite : @xmath10\\left [    i m a_{+}(s,0)/(\\frac{e}{m_{p}})^{\\alpha}\\right].\\ ] ] a different form for the derivative dispersion relation can also be found @xcite @xmath11 ,   \\label{roy - dr}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 . to satisfy these relations",
    "the scattering amplitude must be a unique analytic function of its kinematic variables , and connect different reaction channels",
    ".    a very precise measurement of @xmath4 at the lhc would give the possibility to check the validity of the dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "in turn , as indicated in @xcite , a deviation in the phase of the scattering amplitude could result from the existence of a fundamental length .",
    "now the totem and atlas collaborations have already produced five sets of data at small momentum transfer at @xmath14 tev and @xmath15 tev ( see table 1 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this case only three parameters are fitted ( plus the five normalization coefficients ) .",
    "if all @xmath16 are fixed at @xmath17 , the values of @xmath3 are similar to the previous case but the value of @xmath18 decreases ten times . if the @xmath16 are fitted ( and bounded by @xmath19 ) then the @xmath18 has a minimal value and the values of @xmath3 are similar again to the previous case .",
    "the new data on @xmath3 obtained by the totem and atlas collaborations at @xmath20 tev differ by 6% .",
    "our analysis of the new data on elastic @xmath21 scattering at small @xmath22 and at @xmath0 and @xmath15 tev is based on the crossing symmetry which the scattering amplitude must satisfy ( and which invalidates the  peripheral case \" used in @xcite ) .",
    "the new high energy generalized structure model ( hegs ) , based on these analytic properties , gives a good description of all the elastic nucleon scattering amplitudes at high energy with only 6 parameters .",
    "the hegs model suggests that the discrepancy comes from the normalization of the totem and atlas data .",
    "a purely phenomenological analysis ( table 5 ) gives the same results .",
    "our analysis leads to values of @xmath3 slightly above the atlas value , and significantly below the totem result .",
    "of course a more careful examination of the detailed structure of the slope @xmath23 ( non - exponential , oscillating ) and of the impact of the unitarization procedure is needed .",
    "in particular , one needs to take into account the form factors of hadrons and that fact that the slope of @xmath24 exceeds that of @xmath25 .",
    "the problems with the normalization could be solved via a measurement of the elastic cross sections in the deep coulomb - hadron interference region .",
    "hence we need new high - precision data at small @xmath26 at @xmath27 tev .",
