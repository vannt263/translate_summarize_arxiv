    "a description of the hadronisation of a multiparton system requires specification of the colour connections among the partons .",
    "these can be modified by higher - order interference or non - perturbative effects in qcd , a phenomenon commonly called colour reconnection ( cr ) @xcite .",
    "these effects can only be studied within the framework of specific models .",
    "the present interest in cr arises from the precise measurement of the w boson mass in @xmath2 events in @xmath3 collisions at lep2 energies . in this",
    "fully hadronic final state possible cr effects among the decay products of the two w bosons contribute the largest systematic uncertainty to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "direct information on cr in this channel is obtained from inter - jet particle flow studies @xcite and/or from the w mass itself by comparing different jet algorithms @xcite . due to limited statistics",
    "only extreme models can be excluded .",
    "cr effects might also appear within a colour singlet system like the one produced in the reaction @xmath5(+gluons ) on the z resonance at lep1 where high statistics data are available . to search for cr effects",
    "one has to look for hadronic variables which are sensitive to the colour flow in an event . following a proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite , the opal collaboration has shown that gluon jets with a rapidity gap and zero jet charge , identified in events of the type z @xmath6 jets , provide a sensitive means to search for cr effects , and concluded that two string - based cr models are disfavoured by their data @xcite .",
    "the l3 collaboration , employing angular gaps in the inter - jet regions of symmetric three - jet events , arrived at a similar conclusion @xcite . by comparing quark with gluon jets , the delphi collaboration found that also the standard colour string model ( without cr ) can not adequately describe the fraction of neutral gluon jets with a rapidity gap @xcite .",
    "they suggest a contribution either from a colour octet neutralisation mechanism @xcite or , alternatively , from colour reconnection .    in the present paper",
    "the variables proposed in @xcite are used both to test cr models and to investigate the discrepancy reported in @xcite .",
    "the data were collected by the aleph detector at lep1 .",
    "the data are compared to qcd monte carlo model calculations with and without implementation of cr and with parameters tuned to global properties of hadronic z decays .",
    "gluon jets from three - jet events are identified by either energy - ordering or by anti - b tagging .",
    "the rate of neutral jets is studied as a function of the rapidity gap size .",
    "quark jets from the same events are used for purposes of comparison .",
    "the influence of bose - einstein correlations is also investigated .",
    "some basic properties of the non - perturbative cr models to be discussed in this paper are listed in table [ crmod ] .",
    ".[crmod ] properties of colour reconnection models . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^ \" , ]     this has been done only for the normalized jet charge distributions . in all cases , the model  data differences only change within their statistical errors .    the model ",
    "data comparison of the rate of jets with a rapidity gap relies on the calibration of the average particle multiplicity at the detector level . in all hadronic events , the average charged particle multiplicity , @xmath7 , of all generators , including herwig ,",
    "agrees with the data to an accuracy below 1% which , of course , is a result of the model parameter tuning . for jetset and ariadne",
    "this also holds for three - jet events , and in addition for each of the three jets individually .",
    "in contrast , herwig exhibits a @xmath8 % deficit in each of the three jets of three - jet events , thus giving less reliable predictions .",
    "three - jet final states from @xmath3 annihilation into hadrons are used to test qcd models of colour reconnection ( cr ) . from a sample of approximately @xmath9 million hadronic",
    "z decays , collected by the aleph detector at lep , three - jet events are selected by the @xmath10 cluster algorithm with a fixed cut - off , @xmath11 .",
    "the distributions of particle multiplicity in jets in fixed rapidity intervals and the distributions of the jet charge are investigated .",
    "the main analysis is based on jet energy ordering . according to jetset",
    ", the least energetic jet ( jet 3 ) represents a gluon jet in about of the cases .",
    "gluon jets with a large gap in rapidity and with zero electric charge of the system beyond the gap constitute a particularly sensitive test .",
    "the rate , @xmath12 , of these jets is measured as a function of the rapidity gap size and is compared to predictions of globally tuned qcd generators .",
    "the rate @xmath12 is predicted too high by the string - based cr models jetset+gal and ariadne ar1 when using default values for the cr strength parameters .",
    "thus these two models are disfavoured by the data as already observed in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rate is too low for the standard , non - cr versions of these generators , in agreement with a similar analysis in ref .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter of the gal model is constrained by the data to the range @xmath1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 turns out to be insensitive to cr as implemented in the herwig - cr model .    in a separate analysis of the same data , two b - quark jets",
    "are positively identified using lifetime tagging , thus achieving a very high gluon jet purity of about 97 % for the remaining jet .",
    "the results confirm those of the energy - ordered analysis though with less statistical significance .    assuming that the physics of colour rearrangements is similar in hadronic z decays and in ww decays",
    ", this result would imply that the cr models as implemented in jetset+gal and ariadne overestimate the systematic shift of the measured w boson mass .",
