    "the mixing pattern of the pseudoscalar decay constants associated to the @xmath1-@xmath2 system is usually described in terms of a single mixing angle @xcite . however",
    ", this is not the most general mixing scheme since two axial currents , the eight component of the octet and the singlet , can couple to the two physical states , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , a mixing scheme consisting of two mixing angles should be used instead of the simplest one mixing angle description .",
    "the reason for not using the two mixing angle scheme from the beginning has been the absence of a well established framework able to give some insight on the values of the two different angles and their related decay constants . now with the advent of large @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , where the effects of the pseudoscalar singlet are treated in a perturbative way , the new two mixing angle scheme receives theoretical support .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform an updated phenomenological analysis of various decay processes using the two mixing angle description of the @xmath1-@xmath2 system .",
    "the analysis will serve us to check the predictions of the large @xmath0 chpt for the pseudoscalar mixing parameters ( decay constants and mixing angles ) .",
    "the decay constants of the @xmath1-@xmath2 system in the octet - singlet basis @xmath3 are defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the octet and singlet axial - vector currents whose divergences are @xmath6 \\partial^\\mu a_\\mu^0=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3 } } ( m_u\\bar u i\\gamma_5 u+m_d\\bar d i\\gamma_5 d+m_s\\bar s i\\gamma_5 s)+ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\frac{3\\alpha_s}{4\\pi } g_{\\mu\\nu}^a\\tilde g^{a,\\mu\\nu}\\ , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the gluonic field - strength tensor and @xmath8 its dual .",
    "the divergence of the matrix elements ( [ decaycon ] ) are then written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "each of the two mesons @xmath11 has both octet and singlet components , @xmath12 .",

    "we assume vector meson dominance ( vmd ) and thus neglect these contributions .",
    "the @xmath45 are the leptonic decay constants of the vector mesons and can be determined from the experimental decay rates of @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "finally , we introduce the vertex couplings @xmath36 , which are just the on - shell @xmath34-@xmath47 electromagnetic form factors : @xmath48 which are measured from the decay widths of @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "( [ vmd ] ) allows us to identify the @xmath36 couplings defined in ( [ gvpgamma ] ) with the form factors @xmath39 listed in ( [ fvpgamma00 ] ) .",

    "in order to test the large @xmath0 chpt predictions for the pseudoscalar mixing parameters we must first know the values of the decay constants and mixing angles preferred by the experimental data . we have performed various fits to this set of experimental data assuming the two mixing angle scheme of the @xmath1-@xmath2 system .",
    "the theoretical constraint @xmath55 or @xmath56 is obtained if chiral logs and higher order contributions are also taken into account @xcite . ]",
    "is relaxed in order to test the dependence of the result on the value of this parameter .",
    "the experimental constrain @xmath57 is also relaxed to test the stability of the fit .",
    "the results are presented in table [ table1 ] .    as seen from table [ table1 ] ,",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath52 mixing angle values are different at the @xmath58 level .",
    "the fit with @xmath56 is slightly better than that with @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath53 is left free the experimental data seem to prefer a value higher than the one predicted by chpt ( @xmath55 ) , while for the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath54 our values are in agreement with those of refs .",
    "this increase is translated into a considerably better fit .",
    "however , the analysis of the parameter correlation coefficients reveals a strong positive correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath52 ( @xmath60 ) the latter quantity being taken as a negative number in the present convention ; in other terms , the correlation to the _ absolute _ value of @xmath52 is negative .",
    "the correlations between @xmath53 and @xmath51 or @xmath51 and @xmath52 are negative and much weaker ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) .",
    "it is also observed that when @xmath53 is fixed , the remaining correlation coefficients are smaller .",
    "finally , it is seen in table [ table1 ] that relaxing the experimental constrain @xmath57 does not produce any effect on the fit . a numerical prediction for all the observables used in the fits",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "these predictions show a remarkable agreement with the experimental values .",
    "in this section , we compare our best results for the pseudoscalar decay constants and mixing angles in the octet - singlet basis ( third fit of table [ table1 ] ) with the theoretical expectations of large @xmath0 chpt . these values are extracted from a comparison with experimental data only assuming that the pseudoscalar decay constants involved in the corresponding processes follow the parametrization given in eq .",
    "( [ defdecaybasisos ] ) . using the experimental constrain @xmath63 , one obtains @xcite : @xmath55 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "as stated , our best fitted results are quite in agreement with the former values except for the case of @xmath53 .",
    "note however that in ref .",
    "@xcite the value of @xmath53 is fixed from theory while in our analysis it is fitted from a direct comparison with experimental data where a positive correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath52 appears .",
    "for @xmath67 the results of the fit are in clear agreement with the predictions from large @xmath0 chpt even though the quality of the fit is slightly reduced .",
    "as seen from table [ table1 ] , if the constrain @xmath55 is imposed one gets a worse fit .    our best results for the mixing parameters can be used to check the consistency of the set of equations ( [ mixparthos ] ) , and therefore to test the reliability on the large @xmath0 chpt framework . accordingly",
    ", our fitted values for @xmath53 and @xmath54 together with the third equation in ( [ mixparthos ] ) can be used to get @xmath68 as a prediction for the difference of the two mixing angles in the octet - singlet basis . if one compares this prediction with our result @xmath69",
    "a disagreement is again obtained .",
    "using @xmath67 and our fitted value for @xmath54 ( second fit of table [ table1 ] ) one gets @xmath70 to compare with our result @xmath71 . the second equation in ( [ mixparthos ] ) may be used to get a prediction for the ozi - rule violating parameter @xmath21 once @xmath54 is provided .",
    "using our value for @xmath54 one gets @xmath72 .    the numbers obtained in the former discussion hint at a disagreement with large @xmath0 chpt .",
    "some care should be taken however to qualify this statement .",
    "on the one hand , the statistical significance is still limited , but will obviously improve as critical channels are measured more accurately .",
    "on the other hand , it is plainly clear that the critical information comes here from radiative decays of vector mesons , where we use vector meson dominance .",
    "questions have been raised as to the consistency of vector resonances and vmd with chpt and short distance qcd cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this latter remark should however be moderated by the fact that our approach was carefully tested in the charged mesons sector ( away from the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing problems ) @xcite .",
    "we have performed a phenomenological analysis on various decay processes in order to test the large @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory predictions for the octet and singlet pseudoscalar decay constants and mixing angles .",
    "first we have derived theoretical expressions for the radiative decays @xmath73 and for the @xmath28 form factors using a two mixing angle scheme for the @xmath1-@xmath2 system .",
    "second we have used experimental data on these decays and couplings to fit the values of the mixing parameters in the octet - singlet basis . finally , we have compared our best fitted mixing parameters with the expectations from large @xmath0 chpt showing a possible discrepancy with this framework .",
    "higher accuracy data and more refined theoretical analyses would contribute to clarify the preceding issue .",
