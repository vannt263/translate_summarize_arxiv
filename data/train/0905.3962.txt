    "for typical glass formers with soft potentials the `` glass transition '' is accompanied by a dramatic increase of relaxation times : the viscosity of the super - cooled liquid shoots up by fifteen orders of magnitude within a relatively short temperature range @xcite . when the liquid is examined on microscopic time scales , the molecules seem jammed , trapped into moving only within their cages . of course",
    ", on the much longer viscous time scale these same systems do reach equilibrium by restructuring themselves through an ergodic exchange of particles between cages .",
    "as long as the system is ergodic it lends itself , at least in principle @xcite , to a statistical mechanical treatment .",
    "nevertheless , it is extremely hard to reach a useful statistical mechanical theory as long as one considers the glass former on the level of its constituent particles because it is difficult to evaluate partition - function integrals in continuous coordinates .",
    "it is therefore tempting to find a reasonable up - scaling ( coarse - graining ) method that would define a discrete statistical - mechanics with partition sums rather than integrals , with the sum running on a finite number of quasi - species having well characterized degeneracies and enthalpies . indeed , in a number of examples in 2-dimensions ( 2d ) @xcite and in one example in 3d @xcite it was shown recently that such a discrete statistical - mechanics is possible and quite advantageous @xcite in providing a successful description of the statistics and the dynamics of systems undergoing the glass transition . in this paper",
    "we examine how far the predictions of such a statistical mechanical theory can be pushed . as the theory",
    "is developed on the level of up - scaled quasi - species , one can ask whether the energy , entropy and other thermodynamic quantities appearing in the quasi - species language are identical numerically to the corresponding quantities of the system itself when computed on the level of constituting particles .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "this means that the statistical mechanical theory can be used to quantitatively predict physical observables of interest also beyond the range of measurements , hopefully providing a satisfactory understanding of the phenomenology of glass formation .    to demonstrate the generality of the approach we examine two extremely different models of glass formers to which we apply the same procedure of : i )  identifying an appropriate up - scaling ii )  validating that the chosen up - scaling yields a consistent statistical mechanics and iii )  demonstrating how the resulting theory provides a good understanding of the subtle geometric organizational changes as a function of temperature , of the thermodynamic functions and of the relaxation time .",
    "we will stress the point that understanding the way that the concentrations of the available up - scaled quasi - species depend on the temperature is tantamount to understanding the scenario of the glass transition . to underline the generality of the approach we deal below with two models , one model is studied in 3d in an npt ensemble and the other in 2d in an nvt ensemble .",
    "a short announcement of the results pertaining to the first model was published in @xcite and here we provide considerably richer details .",
    "the results of the second model are novel to the present paper .",
    "the models were chosen , as explained below , to represent extremely different microscopic characteristics ; nevertheless once up - scaled , the statistical mechanics appears very similar encouraging us to propose that the approach is rather general .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ models ] we introduce the two models studied below , discuss the dynamics of their correlation functions as a function of temperature , and measure the relaxation time @xmath4 that will be later connected to the statistical mechanical theory . in sect .",
    "[ upscaling ] we present the upscaling for these two models .",
    "this upscaling defines quasi - species in terms of carefully chosen groups of particles rather than individual particles .",
    "we then show how the scenario of the glass formation can be characterized by the temperature dependence of the concentrations of the various available quasi - species .",
    "since this upscaling is not unique , we present a _ validation _ of the choice of quasi - species .",
    "the validation is a demonstration that the choice of quasi - species provides a self - consistent statistical mechanics . in other words ,",
    "each quasi - species is characterized by its own enthalpy and its own degeneracy .",
    "the statistical mechanics is then shown to be able to accurately recapture the scenario of the glass formation in temperatures where data is available , and to continue to predict it for temperatures that are outside the range of numerical simulations . in sect .",
    "[ dynamics ] we relate the upscaled picture to the dynamics of the system .",
    "we show how a natural static length - scale is appearing , and how this length scale characterizes the relaxation time @xmath4 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ thermo ] we demonstrate that the statistical mechanics as defined on the upscaled quasi - species is able to provide the correct thermodynamic function for the original system .",
    "in other words , we can compute the energy , entropy , specific heat etc . directly from the upscaled picture , in the range of temperatures accessible to simulations as well as for temperatures that are inaccessible to simulations . in sect .",
    "[ summary ] we discuss the degree of generality of the present approach and stress what are the remaining riddles for future research .",
    "some results concerning the upscaling of the first model that is studied below were announced already in @xcite , and here we provide further details .",

    "the reason is that the upscaling using the index @xmath38 takes into account only the particles that reside inside the hump .",
    "the energy of a quasi - species with @xmath38 particles within the hump is proportional to @xmath38 , and thus for low temperatures the energetically preferred subspecies would be the one with no neighbors within the hump . clearly this arrangement does not satisfy the constant volume constraint which needs to be taken into account",
    ". indeed , what we call enthalpies can not be straight energies , otherwise the energies should have been proportional to @xmath38 , making @xmath39 the smallest rather than the largest .",
    "we can summarize the findings up to now by saying that at least in terms of capturing the scenario of the changes in the spatial organization of the particles our statistical mechanics appears very suitable .",
    "our quasi - species appear to have very well defined enthalpies and degeneracies and we can therefore capture the temperature dependence of the concentrations of the quasi - particles with high accuracy .",
    "our thesis is that this scenario is actually the scenario of the glass transition , and hidden in it is also the reason for the slowing down , as demonstrated in the next section .",
    "intuitively the picture should be clear already now . as the temperature reduces the quasi - species with high free energy tend to disappear , leaving us with quasi - species of low free energy .",
    "then the dynamics become more constrained , since it is more costly to change objects of low free energy ( creating on the way objects of higher free energy ) than at high temperature when there are many objects with high free energy that can readily change to objects of lower free energy .",
    "what we need now is to make this observation more quantitative .",
    "in this section we connect the structural theory to the dynamical slowing - down . to this aim",
    "we note that in both models there are a number of quasi - species whose concentration goes down exponentially ( or maybe faster ) when the temperature decreases , and that the relaxation time shoots up at the same temperature range .",
    "we refer to these quasi - species as the ` liquid ' ones ; these are the quasi - species that are prevalent when the temperature is high but are getting rare when the temperature goes down .",
    "we discuss now the connection between this phenomenon and the slowing down .",
    "in this example the ` liquid ' concentrations are those consisting of small particles with 3 - 7 neighbors , and large particles with 6 - 11 neighbors , see fig .",
    "[ cliq ] @xcite .",

    "this length scale has the physical interpretation of the average distance between the ` liquid ' quasi - species .",
    "it was argued before @xcite that this length scale can be also interpreted as the linear size of relaxation events which include @xmath43 quasi - species .",
    "we can therefore estimate the growing free energy per relaxation event as @xmath44 where @xmath3 is the typical chemical potential per involved quasi - species .",

    "ref @xcite ) , in systems with point particles and soft potential , there is no reason to fit the relaxation time to a vogel - fulcher form @xcite which predicts a singularity at finite temperature . in our approach",
    "we predict that @xmath54 only when @xmath55 , and there is nothing singular on the way , only slower and slower relaxation . at some point",
    "the simulation time will be too short for the system to relax to equilibrium , but we can use eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) to predict what should be the simulation time to allow the system to reach equilibrium .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that finite systems of point particles with soft potential are different from finite granular media or systems of hard spheres which can truly jam and lose ergodicity .",
    "point particles with soft potential remain ergodic @xcite , and therefore should be amenable in their super - cooled regime to statistical mechanics .",
    "we argue that in order to construct simple , workable statistical mechanics one needs to up - scale the system and find a collection of quasi - species with well defined enthalpies and degeneracies . in this paper",
    "we showed that the simple criterion to validate the choice of up - scaling which was suggested in @xcite can be applied to very different models once we select the proper up - scaling .",
    "once the structural theory is under control , a natural length scale appears and can be used to determine the relaxation time , also for temperatures that can not be simulated due to the fast growth of the relaxation time .",
    "the fact that the present approach works equally well in two and three dimensions , in npt and nvt ensembles and in very different models provides good reason to believe that it has a substantial degree of generality .",
    "as a last issue we raise the following question : is the statistical mechanical theory as defined on the up - scaled quasi - species determining also the thermodynamics of the original system on the particle level .",
    "the answer to this question is not obvious a - priori , but turns out to be in the affirmative .",
    "as done throughout this paper , we demonstrate this point separately for the two models at hand .",
    "the binary model is studied in the npt ensemble and therefore the first question to ask is whether the average enthalpy of the quasi - species represents the correct enthalpy of the system . in other words",
    ", we have extracted the enthalpies @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "is it then true that the enthalpy of the system , computed as the average potential energy summed over all the pairs of particles and summed with @xmath58 should equal the enthalpy of the quasi - species : @xmath59 in answering this question we remember that our enthalpies are defined up to an arbitrary constant since we chose one of the quasi - species as a reference with zero free energy .",
    "we can therefore add or subtract an arbitrary constant from the lhs or the rhs of eq .",
    "[ yes ] . in fig .",
    "[ compbin ] we show the ratio of the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ yes ] ) to the rhs , with the conclusion that the enthalpy of the system is excellently reproduced by the up - scaled variables .",
    "-1.cm    needless to say , we could therefore compute the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath60 , from either set of data , and from that we could get the entropy of the system , reassuring us that the up - scaling method , once validated as above , provides also the correct thermodynamics for the glass forming system . in the next subsection",
    "we show actual computations of such thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the hump model was studied in the nvt ensemble , and therefore it is interesting to test whether one obtains the correct system s energy .",
    "the potential energies of the quasi - species which were characterized by the number of neighbors that are bound within the minimum are to an excellent approximation linear in that number , @xmath61 as measured with respect to the same zero point as that of the potential ( [ humpot ] ) .",
    "we therefore need to check whether @xmath62 we have added @xmath27 for the excitation around the ground state of the quasi - species ( two degrees of freedom in 2d ) . this test is shown in fig .",
    "[ comphump ] where the predictions of the theory were extrapolated all the way    -1.2",
    "cm    to zero temperature . obviously the data loses its predictability somewhere around @xmath63 where the specific heat becomes negative .",
    "this artifact is seen even better in the plot of the specific heat which is offered in fig . [ compspec ] .",
    "-1.2 cm    nevertheless the plot of @xmath64 vs. @xmath27 indicates the expected typical specific heat peak around @xmath65 which could not be seen in the simulations due to the inherent limitations of computer time .",
    "once the specific heat takes a dive , at some point we can no longer believe the extrapolation , and more accurate data are necessary to be able to predict the thermodynamic properties near zero temperatures .",
    "in summary , we have shown how the scenario of the glass transition can be neatly characterized by the temperature dependence of the concentrations of the various quasi - species that are obtained after up - scaling .",
    "those quasi - species that are readily changed because they are rich in free energy are of course those that deplete first .",
    "we are left with quasi - species that are low in free energy , and these would naturally be hard to change since their change necessarily increases the free energy .",
    "the presumed ergodicity allows us to introduce statistical mechanics which can beautifully encode the scenario , using a small number of quasi - species together with their enthalpies and degeneracies .",
    "the statistical mechanics applies also at temperatures that are beyond the range available to molecular simulations , and can be used to predict what is happening there .",
    "we have shown that when the upscaling and the statistical mechanics work well , the thermodynamics of the system can be understood very well using the up - scaled picture .",
    "there are still issues to understand .",
    "one of our main concerns is how to achieve a first - principles prediction of the parameter @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) .",
    "we have , so far , been unable to bridge this gap , leaving the connection between the dynamics and the upscaling theory still dependent on a phenomenological fit",
    ". a satisfactory prediction of @xmath3 would , in our opinion , close the loop and put to rest the riddle of the slowing down in the glass - forming systems .",
    "also , the upscaling approach had been so far limited to computer model of glass formation , we propose that it would be enlightening to try and apply it to real experimental systems .",
    "we hope that these and other issues would be clarified in future research .",
    "note that in @xcite a smaller set of quasi - species was identified with @xmath67 . in the present treatment",
    "we include in this set all the quasi - species whose concentration goes down significantly in the relevant range of tempeartures , and as a result we find a much improved relation between the compositional and dynamical aspects as seen in fig .",
