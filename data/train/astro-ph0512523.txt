    "the origin of hadronic cosmic - rays ( crs ) remains an unsolved problem since their discovery nearly 100 years ago .",
    "a major area of focus concerns the galactic component of crs , which is thought to be dominant at least up to the _ knee _",
    "( @xmath1  ev ; 1 pev ) , the energy at which a spectral break is seen in the cr spectrum .",
    "it is generally believed that shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) are responsible for the acceleration of the galactic component of crs based on energy budget considerations ( of snrs and of the galactic crs ) , and the good agreement between the observed properties of the cr spectrum and diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) theory . while dsa theory is able to explain many aspects of the observed galactic crs , a controversial aspect concerns the maximum particle energies attained @xcite . a maximum energy limit of @xmath2  ev is generally predicted @xcite which falls somewhat short of the knee energy .",
    "considerably higher energies approaching the _ ankle _ ( @xmath3  ev ) are thought possible if one accounts for significant fluctuations in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "alternative source scenarios have also been considered such as local gamma - ray - bursts ( grb ) @xcite . in the conventional context of snr acceleration of crs , so - called superbubbles , which benefit from the combined effects of many snr shocks and possibly also from the stellar winds of ob associations , may also accelerate crs to well beyond the knee @xcite .",
    "we are therefore left with critical questions concerning the origin of crs at and above the knee .",
    "unfortunately , identifying localised sources of galactic crs at such energies is impossible by direct detection since the cr trajectories are are randomised by galactic magnetic fields .",
    "however , the interaction of crs with local matter can produce a flux of @xmath0-rays in the multi - gev to multi - tev energy band which act as an accessible _ tracer _ of cr accelerators .",
    "moreover , the energy spectrum of the @xmath0-ray flux is expected to follow that of the parent cr spectrum at the site of @xmath0-ray production , thus providing important information concerning the cr acceleration properties .",
    "we note that the interaction of crs with ambient matter proceeds with a typical inelasticity of order @xmath40.15 .",
    "a source of @xmath0-rays , when interpreted in the above framework , is therefore a source of hadronic crs of energies roughly a factor 10 higher .",
    "establishing beyond doubt a hadronic origin for a @xmath0-ray flux is non - trivial since we must often deal with additional leptonic sources of @xmath0-ray production such as inverse - compton scattering and non - thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "these latter components are often diminished at higher energies due to the strong cooling suffered by electrons in magnetised post - shock environments .",
    "morphology differences between the hadronic and leptonic components are also expected , due to a number of physics issues such as energy - dependent diffusion .",
    "spatially - resolved spectra and energy - resolved morphology studies of @xmath0-ray sources are necessary to disentangle the hadronic and leptonic components . in particular , establishing the spectra and morphology of sources of @xmath0-rays at energies 10  tev and above is vital to understanding where and how hadronic cr acceleration to the knee is taking place .",
    "the detection of tev @xmath0-rays is the exclusive domain of ground - based methods , and a major goal of the field is to establish the types of sources responsible for galactic crs .",
    "given the maximum energy problem discussed above , it is not sufficient however just to establish numerous @xmath0-ray source types and their spectral slope , but to clearly establish the maximum energies of their @xmath0-ray fluxes well into the multi - tev domain .",
    "the performance of ground - based @xmath0-ray detectors at energies @xmath5  tev will therefore attract increasing interest over the coming years .",
    "the stereoscopic imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique is employed by all of the present ground - based detectors such as h.e.s.s .",
    ", cangaroo - iii , veritas and magic ( stereoscopy will be employed with an additional telescope - magic - ii ) .",
    "these systems have built on the experience from earlier detectors like the hegra iact - system @xcite which established stereoscopy , and the whipple 10 metre telescope @xcite , which first demonstrated the power of imaging .",
    "survey instruments such as the particle detector arrays milagro , tibet , kascade and casa - mia for example also operate in the tev to pev domain .",
    "we will however not cover results from these experiments , a selection of which may be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the tev results from h.e.s.s .",
    "( see summary in @xcite ) have signalled a turning point for tev @xmath0-ray astronomy in that the number of sources has grown rapidly , and individual source morphology is revealed for the first time @xcite . for the shell - type snr rx  j1713.7@xmath63946",
    "there are now sufficient photon statistics to permit energy - resolved morphology , and spatially - resolved spectral studies @xcite . over half of the more than 20 tev @xmath0-ray source",
    "have a galactic origin @xcite .",
    "many of these new galactic sources , with integral fluxes in the range few % to 15% crab ( at @xmath7  tev ) , have plausible associations with nearby shell - type snr or plerionic snr ( pulsar - wind - nebulae ) .",
    "a striking observation is that the majority of the new sources exhibit generally hard photon spectra , typically characterised by an unbroken power - law @xmath8 with index @xmath9 in the range 2.0 to 2.5 , and extending to up to 40  tev .",
    "the majority are also extended in morphology , with diameters ranging from a few arcmin to a degree .",
    "these results are in line with expectations of dsa theory and give strong hints as to the type of galactic cr accelerators .",
    "the establishment of spectra above energies @xmath410  tev is often limited however by statistics , given the available observation time and sensitivity of h.e.s.s .",
    "deeper observations will in fact be performed on selected h.e.s.s .",
    "sources such as rx  j1713.7@xmath63946 , which will be observed at high zenith angles ( this method is discussed shortly ) during 2005 in a strong effort to establish the spectrum beyond 40  tev .",
    "is optimised for @xmath0-ray detection in the energy range @xmath10  gev up to a few 10s of tev .",

    "telescopes , with mirror area @xmath4120  m@xmath11 , 0.12@xmath12 camera pixel resolution",
    ", 5 deg camera field of view ( fov ) , and a telescope spacing of 120  m , gives h.e.s.s .",
    "an optimal sensitivity in the 1 to 10  tev range , where the cr background rejection is strongest , and the angular resolution is better than a few arcminutes ( see sensitivity curve figure  [ fig : sens ] ) . in this energy range an energy flux sensitivity of @xmath410@xmath13 erg @xmath14s@xmath15 , or 1% crab flux , in 25  h observation time at low zenith angles ( lza ) is achieved .",
    "the performance at higher energies begins to decrease since the camera fov , and telescope spacing ( defining the physical size of the array ) imposes a limit on the detection efficiency .",
    "this limitation may be offset somewhat by employing high - zenith angle ( hza ) observations @xcite , where the observation zenith angle @xmath16 is larger than @xmath17 . at such angles",
    ", the longer atmospheric path length means that the air shower is viewed at greater distances from the telescope . as a result ,",
    "higher energy eas preferentially trigger the detector from considerably larger distances ( impact parameters ) than they would at lower zenith angles , thereby increasing the effective collection area for a given energy , but at the same time increasing the energy threshold . using this technique , the effective collection area of a ground - based system like h.e.s.s . at high energies",
    "approaches 1  km@xmath11 ( figure  [ fig : aeff ] ) .",
    "hza observations have already been demonstrated effectively in the study of the crab nebula by the hegra iact - system @xcite and mkn  421 by h.e.s.s .",
    "the energy spectrum of the crab is now established up to energies approaching @xmath470  tev after very deep observations ( @xmath4380  h ) with the hegra iact - system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crab ] ) .",
    "the mechanism put forward to explain the ( unpulsed ) tev emission of the crab centres on the inverse - compton upscattering of soft photon fields by accelerated electrons .",
    "the inverse - compton @xmath0-rays seen up to 70  tev , along with the synchrotron emission seen up to gev energies by egret strongly imply the presence of electron acceleration to pev energies @xcite .",
    "thus , the crab is likely the first source established as a cosmic _ pevatron_. it therefore remains to be seen if it , and other galactic sources are capable of accelerating hadrons to similar energies .",
    "energy flux sensitivities for various instruments operating in the @xmath0-ray domain , compared the measured and predicted ( synchrotron and inverse - compton ) fluxes from the crab nebula . for the ground - based instruments , limited here to cherenkov imaging systems `` 100-gev arrays '' ( representing h.e.s.s . , veritas and cangaroo - iii ) , hegra iact - system , whipple , 5@5 ) , a 50  h 5@xmath18 detection limit is required .",

    "the highest energy spectral point has an excess significance @xmath20 . ]",
    "observations of mkn  421 were triggered by a flaring state reaching fluxes of up to @xmath46  crab . at the h.e.s.s .",
    "site this northern source is visible at zenith angles @xmath21 , yielding an energy threshold about 2  tev , however with collection areas exceeding 1  km@xmath11 . despite the fact that the energy spectrum of mkn  421 exhibits an exponential cutoff ( @xmath22 where @xmath23  tev ) limiting the photon statistics above 10  tev , hza observations permitted a detection rate of up to 8 @xmath0-rays per minute .",
    "for the first time , variability studies on time scales of hours were performed on this source in the multi - tev energy range .",
    "the hza observation method has limitations however .",
    "observability issues come into play as most sources do not spend much time at high zenith angles . indeed",
    "this method is better suited , for instruments in the south , to viewing sources with northern declinations in order to maximise the available observation time per night ( the opposite of course is true for southern sources viewed from the north ) .",
    "other issues such as atmospheric stability can also reduce the overall efficiency of the observations .",
    "it is clear that we are only just beginning to sample the @xmath0-ray sky at energies @xmath24 to 100  tev at 1%  crab flux sensitivties . over the past decade , is has become apparent that the stereoscopic atmospheric cherenkov imaging technique has proved highly successful for @xmath0-ray detection in the 100  gev to @xmath410  tev energy range .",
    "it is therefore worthwile investigating the same technique optimised for higher energies .",

    "the main motivation was to investigate the potential of the technique , when applying generally conservative specifications to the telescope design . in this sense a quite conservative quantum efficiency ( qe ) ( photons to photoelectrons ) value of 0.1 was assumed .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of both @xmath0-rays and protons viewed at the vertical were used .",
    "two different pixel sizes for the focal plane detectors ( or cameras ) were considered , 0.3@xmath12 and 0.5@xmath12 , and for each case , a two - level tailcut scheme to remove pixels dominated by skynoise was also applied .",
    "a telescope trigger was achieved when at least 2 two adjacent pixels meet a defined threshold ( 10 to 20 p.e . ) .",
    "a stereoscopic trigger was demanded when at least two telescopes have triggered from the same eas . in order to gauge the performance characteristics of the _ cell",

    "these trigger conditions and analysis algorithms applied to the _ cell _ were based on the methods used in the hegra iact - system , and now , also employed by h.e.s.s .",

    "experience has shown that @xmath450 to 100 p.e .",
    "per image are required to accurately reconstruct individual image parameters such as _ width _ , _ length _ and orientation .",

    "depending on the pixel sizes ( 0.3@xmath12 or 0.5@xmath12 ) , one would require between 300 to 800 pixels in order to achieve such fields of view .",

    "figure  [ fig : spacing ] depicts the detection efficiency for four telescopes with spacing 500  m. in fact a spacing in the range 300 to 500  m was found necessary to achieve an 80% efficiency over the desired energy range , when employed in combination with very large fov cameras .",

    "a telescope spacing of 500  m is used and pixel trigger threshold of 10 p.e . from @xcite . ]    assuming then a telescope spacing of 500  m , an energy threshold ( the peak differential rate ) of 7 to 10  tev was achieved for a point source with a crab - like energy spectrum . for a source with a crab - like flux , detection rates of 3.5 @xmath0-rays and @xmath4700 cr background events per hour ( over the entire fov for the cr background )",

    "it is interesting to compare these numbers with the detection rate obtained on real crab data , for energies @xmath34 to 10  tev from both the hegra iact - system and h.e.s.s . detectors .",

    "if one factors in the improved collection area for the h.e.s.s .",
    "crab result , the performance of a single _ cell _ of small telescopes is quite similar to that of h.e.s.s . and the hegra iact - system at the high energies considered .",
    "another important performance measure is the energy resolution , which is estimated at @xmath425% .",
    "this is sufficient to reconstruct energy spectra accurately and in particular determine cutoff features .",
    "of course the majority of sources under future study will emit at sub - crab flux levels .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "results suggesting a population of sources in the 5 to 15% crab flux range ( @xmath7  tev ) , would demand considerable observation time from a single _",
    "cell_. this is helped somewhat by the hard spectra of the new sources ( which would have fluxes @xmath38  crab - flux level for @xmath5  tev ) . in order to detect sources with high statistics in reasonable time",
    "( @xmath39  h ) , @xcite also suggest the use of multiple _ cells _ of 4-telescope arrays .",
    "for example they estimate a total of 25 telescopes ( arranged as 16 _ cells _ of 4-telescopes ) would achieve detection rates ( after cuts ) on the crab of @xmath40 @xmath0-rays and 150 crs in 50  h observation",
    ". this observation time would be sufficient for extraction of a spectrum for a 0.1  crab - flux source .",
    "it should again be stressed that the performance of a high energy array of telescopes would be improved for hard - spectra sources ( the simulation study assumed a softer crab - like spectrum ) , like those being uncovered by h.e.s.s . , and indeed those expected to be the sources of hadronic crs .",
    "finally we note that the detectability of @xmath0-ray sources will be affected by the attenuation of @xmath0-rays due to pair production on the microwave background @xcite .",
    "this loss strongly peaks at @xmath41  pev with a mean free path of @xmath410  kpc , meaning that pev @xmath0-ray astronomy would be limited to searching for relatively nearby galactic sources .",
    "studies of @xmath0-ray sources at energies above 10  tev are vital if we are to understand how and where galactic cosmic - rays are accelerated to and above the knee . since the present ground - based telescopes such as h.e.s.s .",
    "are optimised for energies @xmath4110  tev , it is suggested that a new dedicated system of telescopes be employed to open up the @xmath0-ray sky at higher energies .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of a _ cell _ of four modest - size telescopes employing the same stereoscopic imaging technique as in h.e.s.s .",
    "and the hegra iact - system suggest that sufficient sensitivity is achieved in the @xmath5  tev range .",
    "these encouraging results , from rather conservative simulations , suggest that the stereoscopic imaging approach is a viable method to explore the multi - tev sky .",
