    "with the discovery of the higgs boson , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has completed the discovery of the standard model , and is now tasked with discovering what , if anything , lies beyond it . in the complicated hadronic environment at the lhc , the search for new physics requires assumptions about the way this physics manifests itself in the detector . given the strong motivation for the existence of new physics at the scales probed by the lhc , it is important to ask if the lhc could have missed discoveries because of such assumptions .",
    "two of the most potent signatures to discriminate new physics from the large qcd backgrounds at the lhc are missing transverse momentum ( met ) and hard leptons . in frameworks such as supersymmetry ( susy )",
    ", there are many models ( such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model or mssm ) where susy events are rich with these objects , enabling their discovery .",
    "however , these features are not a theoretical requirement of the susy algebra , but are rather the product of additional assumptions such as the imposition of @xmath0-parity and  generic \" expectations about the low energy spectrum .    @xmath0-parity violation ( rpv ) can radically alter the collider phenomenology of susy by causing the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) to decay .",
    "it is well known that this can be achieved by breaking either baryon or lepton number ( but not both ) while preserving the longevity of the proton ( the primary motivation for introducing @xmath0-parity )  @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that baryon number violating rpv can greatly reduce the collider bounds on supersymmetry ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact until relatively recently there were no experimental searches that could robustly constrain colored superpartners as light as a few hundred gev .",
    "the tight lhc constraints on @xmath0-parity conserving susy have therefore motivated significant theoretical work on baryonic @xmath0-parity violation , in particular attempting to address issues regarding its flavor structure and embedding in a uv model  @xcite as well as the origin of the primordial baryon asymmetry in the face of rapid washout of baryon number  @xcite .",
    "lepton number violating rpv has in comparison seen little interest ; it is often assumed that it can not lower the bounds on superpartners as it introduces additional charged leptons and/or neutrinos .    in this work",
    "we challenge some of these commonly held assumptions about rpv at colliders .",
    "in particular , we show that leptonic rpv can in fact greatly relax the collider constraints on susy , and identify certain classes of models that particularly excel at evading lhc bounds , are potentially even less constrained than identical spectra with baryonic rpv .",
    "further , we illustrate that even in simplified models of baryonic rpv designed to allow superpartners to be as light as possible , there are still significant constraints on the masses of colored superparticles .",
    "although missing energy signatures can be avoided , @xmath0-parity violating susy can often still be constrained by searches that select events with many high-@xmath3 collider objects , due to the tendency of rpv decays to produce many jets and/or leptons . in this paper",
    ", we show that this expectation can fail if the decaying lsp is significantly boosted , which occurs naturally if it is relatively light .",
    "the decay products of a boosted object are collimated along the direction of the boosted particle . as a result of this collimation ,",
    "the decay products fail various isolation cuts , potentially resulting in mis - categorization of the event . for example , in the boosted decay of the lsp to a lepton and jets through a lepton number violating operator , the lepton may not be identified as an isolated lepton and the event could disappear into the large background for jet events .",
    "this would greatly weaken the bounds from searches in leptonic final states .",
    "similarly , searches for baryonic @xmath0-parity violation rely on a large multiplicity of final state jets .",
    "when the jets are produced from a boosted decay , the resulting collimation will result in a decrease in the number of identified jets , affecting the multiplicity assigned to the event and potentially weakening searches that rely on jet multiplicity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the decaying lsp will have a large boost if it is much lighter than the copiously produced colored superpartners .",
    "thus , a change to even very weakly coupled elements of the susy spectrum can dramatically alter the signatures of supersymmetry .",
    "the choice of @xmath0-parity violating couplings of course also determines the collider phenomenology . these can in principle have an arbitrary flavor structure , allowing for a variety of decay modes , including ones that do not respect the nave @xmath4 symmetry between charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "we will show that within this model space there exist scenarios which largely evade existing lhc searches .",
    "in particular , we will demonstrate simple spectra with decays rich in taus , which are currently not much better constrained than purely hadronic final states .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of displaced decays of the lsp , and find that this may eliminate most of the constraints on an lsp decaying to an electron and quarks .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to highlight the qualitatively different collider signatures that can emerge from choices of superpartner spectrum and rpv couplings . in light of the absence of signals of new physics in traditional channels and",
    "the fact that the low energy spectrum of superpartners is governed by undetermined physics at the scale where supersymmetry is broken , it is important to develop experimental techniques with sensitivity to the new types of signatures proposed here . in the bulk of this work ,",
    "section  [ sec : models ] , we discuss various simplified models of rpv susy and point out how the above themes limit the sensitivity of existing searches to certain types of spectra .",
    "we conclude ( section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) with a discussion of the implications of these results for the future discovery prospects of supersymmetry .",
    "to assess the degree to which @xmath0-parity violation can relax the lhc constraints on colored superpartners , we define several simplified models of squark / gluino production and cascade decay with various rpv decay modes of the lsp , of the general form illustrated in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we take all of the squarks to be degenerate in these models ( at least approximately ) , including those of the third generation .",
    "( this is to be contrasted with studies of `` natural susy ''  @xcite which assume that the first and second generation squarks are decoupled , greatly decreasing the total susy cross - section but causing the gluino to decay very distinctively into third generation quarks . )",
    "we focus primarily on models without cascade decays of electroweakinos amongst each other ( e.g. @xmath5 ) , as the additional leptons from such decays can greatly enhance the constraints .",
    "for the case of @xmath0-parity violation through the @xmath1 operator this effect was demonstrated in  @xcite . to avoid this we consider models where the only electroweakinos lighter than the squarks and gluinos are either a single neutralino ( as in figure  [ fig : lqd_lnu_spectrum ] ) or a nearly degenerate multiplet of charginos / neutralinos ( figure  [ fig : lqd_tauqq_nat_spectrum ] ) , such that their cascade decays do not produce hard objects relevant to collider physics .",
    "in these cases the main handles on the susy signal are the extra jets and/or leptons from the actual @xmath0-parity - violating lsp decay .",
    "our exploration of these types of rpv spectra is in contrast to earlier studies of rpv collider phenomenology assuming specific models for the rpv couplings and/or particular minimal spectra , including `` natural '' spectra  @xcite . by including all of the colored superpartners in our simplified models we aim to identify models in which rpv hides a large total susy production cross - section from lhc searches .",
    "note that the spectra of figure  [ fig : spectra ] represent different simplified models depending on whether the gluino is heavier than or lighter than the squarks .",
    "for example , if the squarks are lighter than the gluino , then when squarks are produced at the lhc they will decay to one quark plus a neutralino ; however if the squark is heavier than the gluino then it will undergo a two - step cascade producing three quarks and a neutralino .",
    "searches selecting for high jet multiplicity will be especially affected by this .",
    "the visibility of the lsp decay products varies with the lsp mass and decay length .",
    "light lsps can be produced with large boost from squark / gluino decays , causing their decay products to be collimated .",
    "this can prevent leptons from being sufficiently isolated from other particles to be accepted in collider searches , and can cause jets from the lsp decay to merge , reducing the observed jet multiplicity .",
    "if the lsp has a macroscopic decay length , @xmath6 , then its decay products will have displaced tracks which do nt point back to the primary vertex .",
    "such tracks are rejected by most analyses at atlas and cms , preventing proper reconstruction of leptons and eliminating the sensitivity of standard searches in leptonic final states  @xcite . however , dedicated searches for displaced decays can place strong bounds due to the low backgrounds to these types of events . a limited number of searches have been performed so far in the lhc data ; for the models we consider the most relevant is an atlas search for displaced decays to a muon and jets  @xcite , which will also have some sensitivity if the muon originates from a tau lepton .",
    "displaced decays to electrons and jets , however , are currently not directly constrained by displaced vertex searches .    a recent cms search for long - lived particles decaying to jets  @xcite may have sensitivity to the whole range decays we consider when",
    "the lsp is long - lived , as unlike previous lhc searches it does not require leptons or photons in the event to trigger on before reconstructing displaced vertices .",
    "the search however targets the case of a long - lived particle decaying to exactly two jets and places cuts which operate under the assumption that summing the momenta of the two displaced jets reconstructs momentum of the long - lived particle .",
    "it will therefore have significantly reduced sensitivity to a model with a three - body displaced decay .",
    "it is beyond our means to reproduce the event selection of this analysis , so the bounds , if any , from this search are currently unknown .",
    "displaced decays may also introduce constraints from searches in jets plus met , as they can introduce spurious missing energy in two ways : mismeasurement of the momentum vectors of particles as a result of assuming that all particles originated from the beamline , and the vetoing of displaced muons whose momentum is then unaccounted for .",
    "these effects can be mostly avoided if the lsp decay length is a small fraction of the calorimeter radius so that the error in momentum measurement is small , and if no muons are produced in the displaced decay .",
    "we will assume this in the models we consider .    to determine the constraints on all models",
    ", we perform monte carlo simulations of collider events using madgraph  @xcite to generate the initial pair production , pythia6  @xcite to decay and shower all particles , and a modified version of pgs  @xcite to simulate detector reconstruction .",
    "because pythia uses a flat matrix element for all three - body decays , we weight all events with the appropriate matrix elements for three - body neutralino and gluino decays .",
    "we obtain squark / gluino production cross - sections at nll accuracy using nll - fast  @xcite .",
    "we compute the expected event yield for several of the most relevant searches for new physics at atlas and cms and determine the constraints on parameter space .",
    "further details on our mc simulation , including validation against official atlas and cms results , are given in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we first consider turning on the baryon - violating operator @xmath1 , such that the neutralino lsp decays to quarks .",
    "if no top quarks are produced in this decay , then the spectra we consider ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) give essentially all - hadronic final states .",
    "it has long been known that this is an extremely challenging scenario for lhc searches .",
    "recently however both atlas and cms have performed searches for susy in all hadronic final states  @xcite , relying on the high jet multiplicity of the susy signal to reject qcd background .",
    "official model interpretations for these searches are provided only for models with pure gluino production , with all squarks decoupled .",
    "we reinterpret the recent atlas search in @xmath7  @xcite for spectra including both squarks and gluinos , with all squarks degenerate .",
    "we take the neutralino to be gaugino - like ; i.e. having equal coupling to the three generations of squarks .",
    "we intend to describe decays through @xmath1 operators , but this is complicated by the fact that our simulation pipeline can not accommodate decays through operators with this color structure due to the limitations of pythia6 .",
    "we approximate this model by replacing one of the quarks in the decay of the lsp with a  fake quark \" : a very light , 1 gev neutralino , which we decay to an electron and two quarks .",
    "because the  fake quark \" is so light , it is produced with very high boost in collider events , such that its decay products are highly collimated in the lab frame .",
    "they will therefore appear as a single jet with momentum equal to the  fake quark \" momentum ; the electron is non - isolated and thus simply adds to the calorimeter energy of the jet rather than being identified as a lepton object .",
    "the resulting collider phenomenology , we claim , is essentially identical to that of a true @xmath1 decay of the lsp the features not correctly modeled , such as the jet charge or the ratio of hadronic to electromagnetic calorimeter energies , are not immediately relevant to the searches we consider .",
    "we validate this modeling by reproducing the signal efficiencies reported by atlas in  @xcite ; see appendix  [ sec : atlasuddgluino_validate ] for details .",
    "our results are shown in figure  [ fig : udd ] as constraints in the plane of squark mass and gluino mass , for a spectrum of the type shown in figure  [ fig : lqd_lnu_spectrum ] with two different choices of the lsp mass , 400 gev ( figure  [ fig : uddchi_100 ] ) and 100 gev ( figure  [ fig : uddchi_400 ] ) . in most regions of parameter space the strongest bound",
    "is imposed by the most kinematically stringent signal region of  @xcite , which requires 7 jets with @xmath3 greater than 180 gev .",
    "note that the constraints weaken significantly when the lsp is light , such that its decay products are boosted and tend to merge into a single jet rather than yielding high jet multiplicity .",
    "in fact , in this scenario initial and final state qcd radiation in signal events is essential in order to ever produce enough jets to pass the signal selection .",
    "one can also imagine a model without a neutralino lsp , with the lightest colored superpartner decaying directly through the @xmath1 operator .",
    "the constraints on such a model are plotted in figure  [ fig : uddnochi ] .",
    "the bound from the atlas rpv gluino search is essentially identical to those in the neutralino lsp model with a 100 gev lsp ( figure  [ fig : uddchi_100 ] ) , confirming that in the latter case the neutralino lsp is typically boosted enough to look like a single jet .",
    "however , in the case of a squark lsp searches for paired dijet resonances  @xcite can also be relevant .",
    "these searches select events with two pairs of dijets with similar dijet invariant mass , as would occur in squark pair - production with squarks decaying immediately to two light quarks . in our simplified model ,",
    "the squarks are co - lsps ( if they are lighter than the gluino ) , so they essentially appear as a single  effective \" resonance with cross - section equal to the total squark pair production cross - section .",
    "the results of the cms dijet resonance search  @xcite then imply a bound on the squark masses marked by the orange dashed line in figure  [ fig : uddnochi ] .",
    "of course , in a realistic susy spectrum the squarks will not all be exactly degenerate .",
    "( although imposing flavor symmetries for the squarks for the first two generations is the simplest way to avoid bounds from flavor - changing neutral currents , this still allows different masses for the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 fields . ) variation in masses of the squarks will appear to broaden the effective resonance ; since the cms dijet mass resolution is about @xmath11  @xcite , a variation of @xmath12 between the squark masses will cause them to no longer appear as a single true resonance but rather a much broader structure .",
    "although such a broad peak may still be distinct from the qcd background , bounds on such a feature can not be extracted from the limits on narrow resonances .",
    "note in contrast that small variation between the squark masses will not dramatically affect the bounds from the atlas multijet search .",
    "we therefore do not shade the region constrained only by the dijet resonance bound in figure  [ fig : uddnochi ] , as this exclusion is not robust against small deviations from the simplified model .",
    "if the squark splittings are large enough and the rpv couplings weak enough , the heavier squarks may prefer to decay first to the squark lsp rather than directly to two quarks .",
    "the search  @xcite considers only dijet pairs formed out of the four highest-@xmath3 jets , so for large enough splittings the efficiency to reconstruct the lsp resonance is eroded , though the additional hard partons from the squark decays could contribute to bounds from the atlas multijet search .    for all models",
    "we find that the bound on the gluino becomes much stronger when the squarks are not decoupled .",
    "there is an apparent discontinuity across the black dashed lines in figures  [ fig : udd ] and  [ fig : uddnochi ] where the squark mass and gluino mass are equal ; as discussed above the jet multiplicity increases greatly when the squarks are heavier than the gluinos , which strongly affects the signal efficiency in this search .",
    "conversely , when the squark is just lighter than the gluino then the the quark from the gluino - to - squark decay tends to be soft , reducing the number of high-@xmath3 jets and relaxing the bound , resulting in the `` wedge '' of allowed parameter space just below the black dashed line . as the squarks become very heavy the limit on the gluino mass approaches the official atlas results for decoupled squarks , which we reproduce in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] to validate our simulation .",
    "these results indicate that the lhc now places very significant constraints on the colored superpartners even in what was thought to be the best - case scenario for hiding supersymmetry .",
    "however , for a light lsp it is only gluino production that is actually constrained ; light squarks can be allowed if the gluino is sufficiently decoupled .",
    "( we do not attempt to derive limits for squarks under 400 gev , as at that point the expected number of susy events is so large that our finite monte carlo samples are not sufficient to estimate the extremely small signal efficiencies that could still result in constraints . )",
    "however , such a spectrum is hard to realize naturally since a large gluino mass tends to drag up the squark masses through the rge s .",
    "models with dirac gluinos can avoid these large radiative corrections to the squark mass , but typically suffer from other model - building challenges  @xcite .      in the rest of this work we will explore rpv with lepton number breaking .",
    "we will again consider simplified models of the form shown in figure  [ fig : lqd_lnu_spectrum ] , with a gaugino - like lsp decaying to two light quarks and a charged or neutral lepton .",
    "we first focus on scenarios where the lsp decay always produces a charged lepton ( rather than a neutrino ) .",
    "there are a few possibilities to ensure this decay mode :    * suppose that @xmath13 operators are active and the sleptons are significantly lighter than the squarks , such that the lsp predominantly decays through off - shell sleptons . then if the lsp is a neutral higgsino it will typically decay to a charged lepton , as it does not couple to the sneutrinos .",
    "because of the hierarchy of yukawa couplings , this will result in decays predominantly to tau leptons if the @xmath14 couplings are comparable for @xmath15 .",
    "the same conclusions hold if the lsp is a singlino that couples to the mssm through mixing with the higgsinos .",
    "* one can introduce the non - renormalizable operator @xmath16 into the superpotential .",
    "when the higgs fields obtain their vevs this operator gives the desired three - body decay .",
    "it can be generated by integrating out a heavy lepton @xmath17 with a vectorlike mass and @xmath0-parity violating couplings , e.g. @xmath18 * large left - right mixing in the slepton sector can cause the lightest charged slepton to be significantly lighter than the sneutrinos while still having appreciable left - handed component . in this case decays of the neutralino through @xmath19 will dominantly produce charged leptons even for bino or wino lsps .    in this section we will focus on rpv decays to electrons and muons , in which case there is no true missing energy produced by the lsp decay .",
    "decays to taus will be considered in section  [ sec : tau - rich ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : lqd_emuqq ] shows the bounds on such models in the cases where the lepton in the lsp decay is an electron ( top plots ) or muon ( bottom plots ) , for lsp masses of 400 gev ( left plots ) and 100 gev ( right plots ) .",
    "the purple dotted contours indicate the constraint from a cms search in final states with same - sign leptons  @xcite , which includes signal selections that do not require missing energy .",
    "the red dashed contours are once more the constraint from the atlas @xmath1 gluino search .",
    "we assume that direct production of the lsp is negligible and does not contribute to these constraints , which requires that the lsp be a bino , or , in extensions of the mssm , another very weakly coupled state such as a singlino or photino  @xcite . in this case",
    "we must assume that the higgsinos and winos are heavier than the squarks and/or gluinos if we are to avoid @xmath20 s , @xmath21 s and/or higgs bosons from cascade decays .",
    "note that once again constraints are much weaker when the lsp is light , such that its decay products tend to collimate .",
    "the efficiency of the same - sign lepton search is then eroded as the leptons tend not to be isolated from hadronic activity .",
    "the @xmath1 gluino search loses efficiency due to merging of the lsp decay products into a single jet .",
    "since electrons deposit their energy in the calorimeters , they are included in jets if not identified as isolated objects .",
    "in contrast , muons contribute very little energy to calorimeter jets , resulting in weaker bounds from the @xmath1 gluino search in the case of lsp decay to muons .    in some cms searches leptons",
    "are only checked for isolation from hadrons and photons , not other leptons ; even if two leptons are extremely close to each other typically at least one is accepted  @xcite .",
    "thus a highly boosted decay through an @xmath22 operator , for instance , would not evade leptonic searches at cms .",
    "if the decay of the neutralino is displaced , then the same - sign lepton search is not applicable , but as discussed above there are strong constraints from an atlas search for displaced vertices producing muons  @xcite and from jets + met searches ( as the muon energy is not counted ) . displaced decays to electrons however are much less constrained by current searches than decays to muons , though the cms search for displaced dijets  @xcite could be relevant .",
    "therefore the light shaded region in figures  [ fig : lqd_eqq_400 ] and  [ fig : lqd_eqq_100 ] should be taken as excluded only in the case of prompt lsp decays ; for displaced decays we can only claim the bound form the atlas @xmath1 gluino search ( dark shaded ) .",
    "thus displaced decays producing an electron could perhaps allow for much lighter colored superpartners .",
    "also , in this case the lsp could be a higgsino or wino without running afoul of leptonic searches .",
    "these results suggest that all lhc constraints from searches for leptons could be avoided in models with very light lsps that are produced with high boost , such that their decay products are collimated and the resulting leptons are no longer isolated from hadronic activity .",
    "a pure bino lsp can not be produced directly at colliders and is allowed to be very light ; likewise very weakly coupled states such as singlinos and photinos may naturally be light . figure  [ fig : lqd_emuqq_20 ] shows the bounds on models with a 20 gev lsp decaying to @xmath23 ( left ) or @xmath24 ( right ) .",
    "the constraint from the same - sign lepton search is greatly weakened , to the point where it is in fact less sensitive than the atlas multijet search . however , since the lsp decay products almost always merge into a single jet in this scenario , the cms search for paired dijet resonances  @xcite becomes relevant .",
    "the dotted orange contours of figure  [ fig : lqd_emuqq_20 ] are the constraints from this search on our simplified model with exactly degenerate squarks , very similar to those for squark lsps decaying through @xmath1 ( section  [ sec : baryonic ] ) .",
    "( unlike atlas , cms analyses include muons when clustering jets . ) once again though small perturbations away from exact squark degeneracy are enough to smear out the apparent resonance so that this search is not directly applicable .",
    "this is therefore not a robust constraint on the scale of the squark masses ; light squarks ( @xmath25 ) are allowed provided that they are split by @xmath26 of their mass .",
    "the merging of the lsp decay products into a single jet also means that the cms displaced dijet search will have sensitivity if the decay is displaced ( as it will appear to be two - body ) ; in this case therefore decay to electrons will _ not _ be less constrained when displaced .",
    "remarkably , these models hide the colored superpartners as well or better than the best - case baryonic rpv scenarios , despite the presence of two leptons in every susy event",
    ". the colored superpartners could potentially all be lighter than @xmath27 in these models .     and  [ fig : lqd_emuqq_20 ] , but shown in the plane of squark mass and lsp mass , with the gluino mass fixed to 2 tev .",
    "the lsp is assumed to decay 100% to a muon and two light quarks .",
    "the effect of the collimation of the lsp decay products as the lsp becomes light is clear .",
    ", width=288 ]    as in the case of baryonic rpv , in this boosted lsp scenario the squarks are allowed to be quite light if the gluino is sufficiently heavy .",
    "the dependence of the squark mass bound on the lsp mass is shown in figure  [ fig : squark_vs_chi ] , which shows the constraints in the plane of squark mass and lsp mass for a fixed gluino mass of 2 tev .",
    "this illustrates the continuous erosion of bounds from the same - sign lepton search with increasing lsp boost .    in the above models the large higgsino mass ( at least as heavy as the squarks ) will dominate the electroweak fine - tuning , such that a fully natural theory can not be achieved",
    "it is interesting therefore to ask what occurs when we move away from the simplified model considered so far ( figure  [ fig : lqd_lnu_spectrum ] ) and include higgsinos in addition to a very light bino - like lsp , as in figure  [ fig : lqd_muqq_nat_spectrum ] .",
    "there are now many possibilities for the decays of the colored superpartners .",
    "we will assume that the relative couplings of the lsp and the higgsinos to the squarks are such that the heavy generations ( @xmath28 ) decay to the higgsinos , while the lighter generations decay directly to the lsp .",
    "the charged higgsino will decay to a @xmath20 boson and the lsp ; the neutral higgsinos can decay to either a higgs boson ( @xmath29 ) plus lsp and a @xmath21 boson plus lsp .",
    "we will assume in this example that they decay to both final states with equal branching ratios .",
    "if the gluino is heavier than the squarks , it will decay to two third generation quarks and a higgsino .",
    "the constraints on this model in the squark - gluino plane are shown in figure  [ fig : lqd_muqq_hino250_20 ] , assuming 250 gev higgsinos and 20 gev lsp decaying to @xmath30 .",
    "the constraints on light squarks have tightened somewhat due to the presence of missing energy and non - isolated leptons in the decays of the third generation squarks . however , the bounds in the region of similar squark and gluino masses are comparable to the scenario of baryon number violation ( figure  [ fig : udd ] ) ; squarks and gluinos under a tev are allowed , giving a large cross - section for the production of events with two non - isolated leptons .",
    "we have seen that lrpv can allow colored superpartners ( particularly squarks ) to be much lighter than the current limits on @xmath0-parity conserving models .",
    "for some models , the bounds can in fact be comparable to or even weaker than the bounds on baryonic rpv .",
    "however , new search strategies could make significant progress .",
    "an obvious route is to simultaneously select on both of the distinguishing features of this signal , namely the presence of two leptons and the high jet multiplicity .",
    "a search in final states with same - sign leptons and many hard jets ( without requiring met ) could further probe these models for lsps above 100 gev",
    ". it may be possible to attack the boosted case using an analysis with relaxed isolation requirements on leptons , relying on jet multiplicity cuts to control the background .",
    "the viability of such an approach depends on the standard model background for events with many hard jets and two high-@xmath3 leptons .",
    "the case of displaced decays could be probed by a search for displaced jets that does not assume specific kinematics as the cms displaced dijet search does .",
    "note that the susy production cross - section is quite large for some of the allowed model points , @xmath31 ( see figures  [ fig : combined],[fig : combined20 ] ) , implying thousands of susy events in the 8 tev data from which a signal could potentially be extracted .",
    "we now turn to models in which the lsp decays to a tau lepton and two quarks . as discussed above , this is generic in the case of a neutral higgsino decaying through @xmath13 operators unless those couplings involving taus are suppressed .",
    "a spectrum with squarks , gluinos and a higgsino lsp has the potential to be relatively natural . in order to accurately assess the prospects for this scenario",
    ", we will take the lsp to be higgsino - like in this section .",
    "we first consider a spectrum of the form shown in figure  [ fig : lqd_tauqq_nat_spectrum ] , with a nearly degenerate higgsino multiplet .",
    "we take the splittings within the multiplet to be 1 gev , such that intra - multiplet cascade decays do not produce additional collider objects .",
    "we decay the third - generation squarks and gluino appropriately depending on their dominant higgsino coupling ( e.g. , we take left - handed sbottoms to decay 100% to a top and a chargino ) . the most important difference from the gaugino - like scenario considered above occurs when the gluino is lighter than the squarks , in which case the gluino undergoes three - body decays preferentially to the heavy generations we take the gluino to decay 50% to a neutralino and two top quarks and 50% to a chargino ( of either sign ) , a top quark , and a bottom quark .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lqd_tauqq_nat ] , we show the most relevant constraints on the squark and gluino masses assuming this spectrum with the lsp decaying 100% to @xmath32 , for a 100 gev lsp .",
    "the blue contour indicates the constraint from an atlas search for many ( 7 + ) jets and missing energy  @xcite . in this case",
    "the missing energy in these events arises mainly from neutrinos produced in tau decay , and is greatly suppressed compared to models with stable neutralinos .",
    "unlike most lhc searches in jets and missing energy however , this search does not use use a met trigger to collect the data sample but rather a multijet trigger , and merely requires that the met in an event be statistically significant .",
    "the high jet multiplicity of these events in conjunction with moderate met cut is sufficient to place constraints , particularly on the gluino mass ; the squarks are much less constrained due to the lower jet multiplicity in squark production events .",
    "the red dashed lines are once more the constraint from the atlas @xmath1 gluino search  @xcite",
    ".    we do not present bounds from searches selecting hadronic taus in the final state , as the algorithms used by atlas and cms for tau reconstruction are not reproduced by our detector simulation .",
    "the relevant searches all require large missing energy however , so we do not expect them to place competitive bounds .",
    "we have checked that , using the default pgs tau reconstruction , the bounds from the atlas search in jets + taus + met  @xcite places much weaker bounds than the multijet + met search .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the region where the squark and gluino masses are similar , the constraints are comparable to those in the baryonic rpv case ( figure  [ fig : udd ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there could be models with this form of lepton - number - violating rpv that are only as fine - tuned as baryonic rpv models with similarly light higgsinos .",
    "this would achieve a more natural electroweak scale without the complications of baryon number violation for baryogenesis , nucleon decay , etc .",
    "as in the case of lsp decays to light leptons , new searches could capitalize on the non - hadronic aspects of these susy events , though relying on hadronic taus is more challenging ( and will likely be impossible for taus that overlap with jets ) .    , but with a 20 gev lsp decaying to a tau and two light quarks .",

    "unlike the case of lsp decay to the lighter leptons , here squarks will not appear as true dijet resonances due to the missing energy from the tau decay .",
    "although we find that squark production in this model still gives a peak in the paired dijet mass spectrum ( somewhat below the mass of the squarks ) , it is much broader than would be expected from a true resonance .",
    "the results from the cms paired dijet search are therefore not directly applicable , even if the squarks are indeed exactly degenerate .",
    "next we consider the same squark - gluino - lsp spectrum , but with the lsp decaying 100% to a neutrino and two bottom quarks .",
    "this decay is predicted by bilinear rpv , in which the dominant source of @xmath0-parity violation is the bilinear term @xmath34 in the superpotential .",
    "after mass diagonalization the leptons and higgs doublets mix by some angle @xmath35 , giving rise to trilinear rpv terms of the form @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lepton and down - type quark yukawa matrices respectively .",
    "the dominant operators are therefore @xmath40 , which can allow the neutralino to decay to a charged lepton , top quark and bottom quark or a neutrino and two bottom quarks .",
    "if the lsp is lighter than the top quark , only the latter decay can occur .",
    "decays through the operator @xmath41 will generally be subdominant , but could give rise to lepton - rich signatures .",
    "the phenomenology of this model in the light of 7 tev lhc data was discussed extensively in  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was shown that neutrino mass constraints require the @xmath0-parity violating couplings in this model to be weak enough that the lsp tends to have a displaced decay , in which case the bounds on superpartner masses were drastically weakened .",
    "the macroscopic displacement of tracks prevents reconstruction of objects such as leptons and @xmath42-jets , or for cms studies prevented the identification of jets completely .",

    "such branching ratios may be called `` generic '' for decays through @xmath19 operators due to @xmath4 symmetry , though as we have seen there are important exceptions e.g. in the case of higgsino lsps or decays to the third generation .    in figure",

    "was made possible by a simple new search strategy of selecting many ( 6 + ) jets with very high @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath0-parity violation necessarily results in a high - multiplicity final state , selecting events with many jets appears to be an extremely powerful strategy , in some sense replacing the missing transverse momentum cuts used to search for @xmath0-parity conserving susy .",
    "use of jet substructure techniques , as proposed in  @xcite and implemented to some extent in the atlas multijet+ met search  @xcite , could help further distinguish susy signal events from qcd backgrounds .",
    "we also considered a variety of leptonic rpv models .",
    "these are generally _ but not always _ more strongly constrained thanks to the many existing searches for charged leptons and/or missing energy .",
    "in particular , we identified several lrpv scenarios which allowed light colored superpartners , sometimes with even weaker constraints than baryonic rpv .",
    "decays of the lsp to a neutrino are strongly constrained by searches requiring high jet multiplicity and small but statistically significant missing energy ( figure  [ fig : lqd_nubb ] ) .",
    "interestingly , decays of the lsp purely to a charged lepton and two quarks are less constrained by existing searches , despite the high proportion of events with a same - sign lepton final state .",
    "we identified a number of leptonic rpv scenarios in which the bounds on squarks and gluinos can be comparable to or even weaker than those for baryonic rpv models :    * if the lsp is very light , such that it is produced with high boost in the decays of the squarks and/or gluino .",
    "the lsp decay products then tend to merge into a jet , causing the lepton to fail isolation criteria .",

    "the only possibly relevant displaced vertex search is the cms displaced dijet search  @xcite which selects for long - lived particles with two - body decays but could have some nonzero efficiency for this final state . *",
    "if the lsp decays 100% to a tau and two jets , as is favored for a higgsino , then the bounds from many jet + missing energy searches are only slightly stronger than those on baryonic rpv ( figure  [ fig : lqd_tauqq_nat ] ) .",
    "these `` gaps '' in the coverage of leptonic rpv suggest new or modified searches .",
    "one general avenue for progress would be to search for events with many jets and one or more leptons .",

    "searches of this type have been proposed previously in the literature  @xcite in the context of models with high jet multiplicity and leptons from @xmath20 s , @xmath21 s or tops ; our models represent another qualitatively different scenario that could be probed by this type of search . the specific mc studies in these works",
    "consider selecting events with many jets , one lepton and either moderate met or @xmath42-jets ; to cover the models we discussed one could relax any met or @xmath42-tag cuts but instead look for events with two ( possibly same - sign ) leptons .",
    "a search selecting taus ( without requiring missing energy as existing analyses do ) , though more challenging , would target the highly motivated scenario of a higgsino lsp decaying through the @xmath19 operator .",
    "this strategy alone will not succeed in the case of highly boosted lsps , where the efficiency for leptons to pass isolation requirements can approach zero .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the possibilities for searches which relax the standard lepton isolation criteria .",
    "this has already been done in searches for  lepton jets \" , sprays of collimated leptons ( with no overlapping hadronic particles )  @xcite .",
    "allowing leptons to overlap with hadronic energy introduces large backgrounds , including pure qcd scattering ; however the multijet searches  @xcite demonstrate that qcd backgrounds can be greatly attenuated by requiring many hard jets .",
    "it seems likely that searches selecting for non - isolated leptons plus many jets and/or high @xmath48 would have greater sensitivity to certain models than purely hadronic searches . further assessing this claim requires careful study of the standard model backgrounds for non - isolated leptons .",
    "note that many models motivating lepton jet searches  @xcite will also give rise to collimated showers including both hadrons and leptons in much of their parameter space , further motivating this type of search .",
    "we have seen that displaced decays can nullify most searches for new physics which rely on leptons or @xmath42-jets ; however displaced vertices offer a very distinctive signature in their own right .",
    "currently , there is a gap in the official coverage in the case of three - body displaced decays which do not produce muons ( e.g. , a decay to three quarks or an electron and two quarks ) .",
    "a cms search for displaced dijets  @xcite could have sensitivity in this case depending on how restrictively they select for two - body decays . a similar analysis relaxing the assumption of a two - body decay could close all scenarios for displaced neutralino decays through rpv .",

    "this lower bound is only achieved when the squarks are either very heavy or just lighter than the gluino ; if the squarks are much lighter then the gluino bound can extend as high as @xmath50 .",
    "it remains possible , however , to have very light squarks in certain models , such as baryonic rpv ( figure  [ fig : udd ] ) or with leptonic rpv with boosted decays ( figure  [ fig : lqd_emuqq_20 ] ) these models survive since squark decay typically produces fewer jets than gluino decay , rendering multijet searches much less effective . probing these squark - only models remains an open experimental challenge . in the case of",
    "boosted lsps decaying to leptons , a search for non - isolated leptons as suggested above could have sensitivity .",
    "scenarios with highly boosted lsps also allow for squarks to be reconstructed as dijet resonances if no neutrinos are produced in the lsp decay .",
    "as we discussed , existing searches for paired dijet resonances  @xcite are only directly sensitive if the squarks are degenerate to within a few percent ; however even if the squarks have significant mass splittings they could still give rise to distinct features in the paired dijet mass spectrum , such as broad bumps or multiple smaller peaks",

    "some leptonic rpv scenarios appear to rival baryonic rpv in terms of minimizing fine - tuning , in particular the scenario of a higgsino lsp decaying to a tau and two jets ( section  [ sec : tau - rich ] ) .",
    "although the collider phenomenology of this scenario resembles that of baryonic rpv , the implications for precision physics and cosmology are radically different . in particular , baryonic rpv models imply the washout of any cosmological baryon asymmetry down to very low temperatures if the rpv coupling is large enough to cause prompt decays at colliders  @xcite , forcing baryogenesis to occur at very low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , leptonic rpv allows for baryogenesis any time during or after the electroweak phase transition , once sphalerons no longer equilibrate @xmath51 to zero .    throughout this work",

    "the origin of this discrepancy ( i.e. , of the rapid rise in the cross - section limit reported by cms as the gluino mass is lowered below 500 gev ) is unknown to us .",

    "<S> supersymmetry is under pressure from lhc searches requiring colored superpartners to be heavy . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate @xmath0-parity violating spectra for which the dominant signatures are not currently well searched for at the lhc . in such cases </S>",
    "<S> , the bounds can be as low as 800 gev on both squarks and gluinos . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that there are nontrivial constraints on squark and gluino masses with baryonic rpv ( @xmath1 operators ) and show that in fact leptonic rpv can allow comparable or even lighter superpartners . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints from many searches are weakened if the lsp is significantly lighter than the colored superpartners , such that it is produced with high boost . </S>",
    "<S> the lsp decay products will then be collimated , leading to the miscounting of leptons or jets and causing such models to be missed even with large production cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> other leptonic rpv scenarios that evade current searches include the highly motivated case of a higgsino lsp decaying to a tau and two quarks , and the case of a long - lived lsp with a displaced decay to electrons and jets . </S>",
    "<S> the least constrained models can have susy production cross - sections of @xmath2 or larger , implying tens of thousands of susy events in the 8 tev data . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest novel searches for these signatures of rpv , which would also improve the search for general new physics at the lhc . </S>"
