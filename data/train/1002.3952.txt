    "assuming that the light propagation is approximated by a single scattering event by the cluster ( single lens approximation ) and that a light deflection occurs within a sufficiently small region ( @xmath124 ) compared to the relevant angular diameter distances ( thin - lens approximation ) , we have the deflection angle by a single cluster as @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the angular diameter distances from the observer to the source , and from the deflector to the source , respectively , and @xmath128 is the comoving transverse vector on the lens plane . in a cosmological situation ,",
