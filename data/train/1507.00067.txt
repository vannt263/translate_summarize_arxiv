    "the theory of combinatorial limits has recently attracted a significant amount of attention .",
    "this line of research was sparked by limits of dense graphs  @xcite , which we focus on here , followed by limits of other structures , e.g.  permutations  @xcite , sparse graphs  @xcite and partial orders  @xcite .",
    "methods related to combinatorial limits have led to substantial results in many areas of mathematics and computer science , particularly in extremal combinatorics .",
    "for example , the notion of flag algebras , which is strongly related to combinatorial limits , resulted in progress on many important problems in extremal combinatorics  @xcite .",

    "finitely forcible graphons appear in many different settings , one of which is in extremal combinatorics .",
    "it is known that if a graphon is finitely forcible , then it is the unique graphon which minimizes a fixed finite linear combination subgraph densities , i.e.  finitely forcible graphons are extremal points of the space of all graphons .",
