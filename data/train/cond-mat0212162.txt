    "cohesionless granular materials exhibit a range of behavior that has fascinated physicists , applied mathematicians , and engineers from coulomb , in the late @xmath0 century , to schaeffer , in the late @xmath1 and early @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore somewhat surprising that perhaps the simplest question one can ask about a granular material remains unanswered even now . given a box full of sand , if a marble is placed on top of the sand , how is the weight of the marble distributed on the bottom of the box ?",
    "the problem is not just quantitative ; we do not even know the qualitative form of the pattern of vertical force on the bottom generated by the marble .",
    "we do not know , for example , whether the vertical force is largest directly underneath the marble or has a maximum on a ring . and the citations therein for background material . ]",
    "experiments suggest that qualitative features of the response may depend on the way in which the sand was put into the box or on the geometric and frictional properties of the grains.@xcite . experiments on 2d layers with depths up to approximately 12 grain diameters show both two - peak and single - peak responses , depending on the geometry of the grains and/or degree of disorder in the packing .",
    "@xcite experiments on 3d layers have probed the response in layers as deep as 300 grain diameters , and single peaks directly beneath the applied load were observed .",
    "@xcite a theoretical framework that allows a unified interpretation of these results would be of great interest .",
    "let us formulate a thought experiment that focuses on the central features governing the stress pattern at the bottom of the sandbox .",
    "the fundamental problem has to do with how stress is transmitted through the bulk of the material , so it is natural to eliminate the side walls from consideration by imagining a slab of sand that is infinite in horizontal extent .",
    "it is also tempting to eliminate the effect of the bottom boundary by imagining it to be at infinity , where all stresses are infinitesimal , and calculating the stress as a function of depth far from the bottom boundary .",
    "we will see , however , that in the context of an interesting class of models the bottom boundary condition plays an essential role .",
    "we can also eliminate from the problem the complicating effects of gravity .",
    "we consider a slab of sand between two plates that are being pushed together .",
    "the density of the sand is assumed to be high enough that the material rigidly resists the force applied by the plates .",
    "the material is then subjected to a localized force created by poking a needle through the top plate and applying a specified force to it . note that both plates and the confining pressure are essential in this setup . without them , some grains at the surfaces of the slab would likely be subject to outward forces that could not be balanced , so the material would not support any force at all on the needle .    a third simplification is to assume that the bulk granular material is isotropic .",
    "that is , we assume that the geometry of the grain packing does not distinguish any particular direction in space . while the local environment of any particular grain is clearly anisotropic , we assume that this anisotropy , as measured for example by the fabric tensor which characterizes the degree to which there are preferred directions for `` bonds '' joining the centers of grains in contact , vanishes when coarse - grained over sufficiently large volumes . this is a strong assumption , as construction history of a real granular material may well distinguish favored directions for contacts.@xcite nevertheless , there are highly nontrivial structures to be uncovered even in isotropic models and it is surely appropriate to understand them before attempting to include the complications and additional parameters associated with intrinsic anisotropies .    finally , for simplicity , we can work with a two - dimensional system .",
    "the top of the slab is a line defined to be at @xmath3 and the bottom is defined to be @xmath4 .",
    "the slab is infinite in the horizontal @xmath5 direction .",
    "we are interested in determining the response to a localized force applied at @xmath6 and @xmath3 .    treating the sand as an ordinary ( linear ) elastic medium , a standard treatment",
    "@xcite indicates that @xmath7 should have a single peak centered on @xmath6 with a width that grows linearly with depth .",
    "this treatment assumes , however , that the stress field is governed by equations derived using the continuity of a well defined displacement field and that there is a unique stress associated with each strain configuration .",
    "neither of these is true for a granular material consisting of rigid particles that support frictional forces , so a new approach is needed .",
    "the problem of deriving macroscopic stress equations from known microscopic or grain scale physics has proven quite difficult .",
    "an indication of just how difficult this might be can be found in almost any experiment or numerical simulation that generates images of the intensity distribution of stresses on scales of several grain diameters.@xcite in such images , one sees immediately that the stress is concentrated on filamentary structures called _ force chains _ that support compressive stress .",
    "these chains appear to be relatively straight on scales of up to 10 grain diameters or so and give the visual impression of splitting and fusing at a variety of angles .",
    "the presence of such structures suggests that passage from the grain scale to the macroscopic stress will involve two distinct steps : we must understand how grain scale physics favors the formation of chains , and also how the interactions among chains determine the macroscopic stress field .",
    "while these two tasks must ultimately be facets of a unified theory , it may be useful to approach them separately .",
    "models of _ directed force chain networks _ ( dfcns ) have recently been proposed to bridge the gap between the scale of individual chains and the macroscopic stress , leaving open the issue of how grain scale physics promotes chain formation.@xcite ( this type of model is also referred to as a -model.@xcite ) . as detailed below , a `` boltzmann equation '' governing the densities of chains with specified strengths and orientations",
    "can be obtained , assuming only that whether a chain splits at a given point is determined only by the local environment around that point and that environments that lead to splitting are homogeneously distributed throughout the material .",
    "an essential feature of this equation is that the unstressed solution is unstable ; perturbations of it lead to divergent responses .",
    "thus in order to calculate physically meaningful response functions , it is necessary to perturb around a pre - stressed state .",
    "the only case for which response functions have been calculated is the special one in which all force chains support the same magnitude of stress and lie on a 6-fold symmetric set of vectors . in that case , the response consists of two peaks whose centers diverge linearly with depth but whose widths grow like the square root of depth . in other words ,",
    "the only solved case of response functions for dfcns suggests that stress propagates along characteristic directions determined by the homogeneously pre - stressed state , in marked contrast to expectations from standard elasticity theory.@xcite this propagation of stress is a feature of noisy hyperbolic equations and is therefore called a `` hyperbolic response . ''",
    "@xcite    it is worth noting here that hyperbolic response is known to occur in models of isostatic packings of frictionless grains @xcite and that simple constitutive relations leading to hyperbolic stress equilibrium equations have been shown to explain nontrivial features of experiments on sandpiles and granular columns .",
    "@xcite one must also note , however , that direct measurements of the response seem to indicate that single - peaked response is associated with strongly disordered packings , and hyperbolic response occurs only in ordered systems or at shallow depths .",
    "@xcite    the question immediately arises as to whether the hyperbolic response of the 6-fold dfcn model is an artifact of the confinement to a discrete set of directions , or perhaps of the unique property that all chains in the 6-fold dfcn have the same strength . to investigate the robustness of the 6-fold dfcn results , one would like to find other analytically tractable cases . here",
    "we address the first step in this direction ",
    "the identification of models for which stable solutions can be found for homogeneous macroscopic stresses .    in this paper",
    "we present homogeneous solutions to the dfcn boltzmann equation for special cases in which chains lie along a discrete set of directions with 8-fold , or more generally 4n - fold , symmetry in two dimensions .",
    "even the homogeneous solutions  the pre - stressed states about which we might contemplate calculating response functions  have nontrivial features .",
    "the actual calculation of the response functions these solutions is beyond our present scope .",
    "this paper also provides corrections to the presentation fo the general boltzmann  equation of ref .",
    "the corrections do not affect any of the calculations on discrete models reported in that paper , but do clarify some conceptual points crucial for future work on continuum models or models permitting multiple splitting angles .",
    "a dfcn is a collection of line segments with associated compressive forces assigned such that force balance is achieved at every vertex .",
    "figure  [ fig : dfcn ] shows a simple example that illustrates several features .",
    "first , each segment is assigned a strength , or force intensity , that is indicated in the figure by the thickness of the line .",
    "every chain is assumed to be under compression , so the force exerted on a vertex due to a given chain is directed along the chain toward the vertex , and the vector sum of the forces at any given vertex must vanish .",
    "= 0.8    second , each segment is assigned a direction , indicated by the arrow , which distinguishes its `` beginning '' from its `` end . ''",
    "the physical distinction lies in the local grain configurations at either end of the chain .",
    "certain configurations do not allow propagation of a chain through them in certain orientations and therefore give rise to force chain splitting .",
    "the relevant configurations of this type for the network shown in the figure are indicated with large circles .",
    "other local configurations would not necessarily require a splitting event , but do permit two chains to fuse when they intersect .",
    "the relevant configurations of this type are indicated with small circles .",
    "the directions of chains in the entire network are determined by the specification of the applied boundary forces .",
    "one must think , for now , of the force being applied at point a as coming from a needle being poked through the top plate and held at constant force .",
    "this ensures that a chain beginning at a must be present . at point b ,",
    "a local configuration exists that requires the chain to end . to balance the force at b ,",
    "two chains must be initiated .",
    "hence the arrows on these to chains must point away from b.    by tracing the chains initiated by applied forces at the boundary and taking into account the type of local environments at the chain endpoints , each chain direction can be uniquely assigned , with the exception of rare cases in which fusions happen to occur precisely at places that might be mistaken for splittings . when all directions are assigned ,",
    "one is likely to find some chains that end , rather than begin , on a boundary .",
    "the boundary forces required to balance these forces , shown as dashed arrows in figure  [ fig : dfcn ] must be interpreted as a _ response _ to the applied forces .    finally , there is the possibility that a single chain can appear to have inconsistent requirements on its direction , as occurs for the chain passing through point e in figure  [ fig : dfcn ] . here",
    "two splitting events have initiated chains along the same direction that meet head on .",
    "formally , this corresponds to a fusion event in which the outgoing chain has zero strength , which thus appears as the annihilation of two chains , and the circle marking this fusion can be imagined to lie anywhere along the chain .",
    "the probability of such configurations is determined by the grain size , or , more precisely , by the ratio of the grain size to the typical separation between force chains of opposite directions . in the following",
    ", we will take this probability to be zero .",
    "( but keep in mind that a nonzero probability can be invoked to cut off the divergence in the density of weak force chains that arises in the 8-fold model . )    figure  [ fig : forcechains ] further illustrates the difference    =    between chain splitting and chain fusion in the context of a hexagonal array of grains . in panel",
    "( a ) , two forces are applied at the top boundary and the forces propagate along chains , crossing at the central grain . in panel ( b ) , a similar situation is shown , but this time one of the chains is assumed to be specified by fixing its position at the bottom boundary instead of the top . in this case ,",
    "a fusion of the two chains at the central grain is permitted ( though not required ) and the resulting configuration may be different .",
    "panel ( c ) shows a local configuration ( a missing disk ) that requires the splitting of an incoming chain .    thus each chain is characterized by an intensity , @xmath8 , and a direction @xmath9 , or , equivalently , a vector @xmath10 .",
    "force balance at a vertex requires that @xmath11 for incoming chains equals @xmath11 for outgoing chains .",
    "positive values of @xmath8 correspond to compressive stress along a chain .",
    "negative values to tensile stress . to model noncohesive materials , which do not support tensile stress , we take @xmath8 to be always positive definite .",
    "thus there is no ambiguity introduced by using @xmath10 to denote the pair @xmath12 .",
    "when convenient , we will use the angular variable @xmath13 to indicate the direction of @xmath9 .",
    "we will use the term `` @xmath10-chain '' to refer to a chain with the given strength and direction .      _",
    "the following discussion supersedes the treatment given in ref .",
    "_ in that paper , mistaken reasoning was used in writing the continuum equation .",
    "the mistake does not affect the bulk of that paper , since the forms obtained there for networks of chains confined to a discrete set of directions were the same as those derived below .",
    "nevertheless , the corrections made here may be important for future work on continuum models and are necessary for conceptual clarity . note especially that the definition of @xmath14 has different dimensions here from that used in ref .",
    "the theory is developed here explicitly for the case of two dimensions .",
    "generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward .",
    "let @xmath15 represent the density ( in an ensemble average ) of force chains of intensity @xmath8 and direction @xmath13 passing through the spatial point @xmath16 . in other words , @xmath17 is the number of chains with intensity between @xmath8 and @xmath18 that cross a unit length line segment passing through @xmath16 and perpendicular to @xmath19 . with this definition ,",
    "@xmath20 is defined with respect to a uniform measure in the 2d space of possible forces . given @xmath21 ,",
    "the local macroscopic stress tensor is given by @xcite @xmath22    we wish to construct an equation that describes the ensemble average of the spatial variations in the chain densities for a system subject to specified boundary conditions .",
    "to do so , we consider the probability that a chain @xmath10 will exist at a point @xmath23 , assuming we know @xmath24 .",
    "a given material will be characterized by a two scalar parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and two angular functions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "* @xmath25 is the average distance in any specified direction between the point where a chain begins and the nearest point that will cause it to split ; i.e. , the mean length chains would have if there were no fusions .",

    "* @xmath26 is an overall efficiency with which two intersecting chains will fuse .",
    "that is , the total probability that two intersecting chains will fuse is @xmath34    @xmath27 and @xmath28 must both include delta functions that enforce force balance at each intersection and heaviside functions that guarantee all forces are compressive .",
    "we neglect , for now , the finite size of individual grains .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath25 is large compared to a grain diameter and treat the granular packing underlying the force chain network as a continuous medium .",
    "the equation governing the spatial variation of @xmath14 as follows ( for notational convenience , we have dropped the @xmath16 from the argument of all of the @xmath14 s ) : @xmath35 each term on the right hand side represents a type of event that can alter the density @xmath20 .",
    "we discuss each in turn :    * the first term represents the loss of @xmath10-chains due to splitting .",
    "the @xmath36 factor is exhibited explicitly for future convenience . here",
    "@xmath20 may be taken out of the integral . to ensure that @xmath25 is the mean distance between a chain will propagate before splitting ( in the absence of interactions with other chains )",
    ", we must therefore have @xmath37 note that @xmath27 has dimensions of @xmath38 . *",
    "the second term represents the creation of @xmath10-chains due to the splitting of chains in other directions .",
    "the splitting function here must be the same as in the first term , but with arguments exchanged , since the rate at which chains chains appear due to splitting must match the rate at which the parent chains split .",
    "the factor of @xmath39 counts the identical integral arising from the exchange of the prime and double - prime labels . * the third term , which is nonlinear in @xmath14 , represents the loss of @xmath10-chains due to their fusions with @xmath40-chains ( or @xmath41-chains , hence the factor of @xmath39 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is the density of intersections of @xmath10 and @xmath40-chains , and @xmath28 is specifies the probability of fusion when two such chains meet . here",
    "again @xmath20 can be taken out of the integral .",
    "we choose to normalize @xmath28 such that the remaining integral has a maximum value of unity over the set of @xmath43 s of the form @xmath44 , for all values of @xmath45 .",

    "the parameter @xmath26 then provides an absolute measure of the fusion efficiency .",
    "@xmath28 has dimensions @xmath48 , in contrast to @xmath27 .",
    "* the fourth term represents the creation of @xmath10-chains due to the fusion of chains in other directions . for consistency",
    ", the fusion function must be the same as in the third term .    for materials composed of perfectly rigid grains , a rescaling of all of the forces in a given dfcn yields another perfectly acceptable network .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ eqn : master ] ) must be invariant under a rescaling of all the force intensities .",
    "this is verified by straightforward dimension counting ( unlike the form of the boltzmann equation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "consider further the general forms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "first , we assume that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are nonzero only for vertices of the forms shown in figure  [ fig : vertices ] .",
    "this means that all chains lie in the discrete set of directions @xmath66 ( measured from the positive @xmath67 direction , which is downward ) , and that the strong force at a given vertex is always related to two weak ones by a factor of @xmath68 .",

    "note that @xmath75 is simply a number per unit length ; the dimensions of force are taken care of by the two - dimensional delta function .",
    "we will treat the case @xmath76 explicitly here .",

    "when @xmath14 is a sum of two - dimensional delta functions , the fusion integrals have two more delta function factors than the splitting integrals .",
    "the same can be seen in the normalization conditions of equations  ( [ eqn : phisnorm ] ) and  equations  ( [ eqn : phifnorm ] ) .",

    "the force scale represented by this peak must have its origin in the boundary conditions , since a linear rescaling of all forces in the bulk has no effect on the dfcn structure . recall that part of the process required to collapse the solutions onto the one - parameter family indexed by @xmath134 was to rescale @xmath179 , which corresponds to a rescaling of the strengths of the force chains injected at the boundaries .",
    "there are subtleties lurking here , however , as will be discussed further in section  [ sec : boundaryconditions ] .",
    "= 0.95    a full calculation of the single contact force distribution @xmath180 is slightly more complicated than for the isotropic case , as it requires a sum over the different chain orientations .",
    "it is not hard to extract the dominant term at large @xmath8 , however . for the symmetric @xmath181 case with @xmath182 ,",
    "( [ eqn : solutions ] ) can be written as @xmath183 where @xmath184 as above , and @xmath185 . since @xmath126 ,",
    "the dominant term at large @xmath8 will be @xmath186 .",
    "it is important to note that the anisotropy of the solution is _ not _ a consequence of any material anisotropy .",
    "the bulk properties of the material we are describing are perfectly isotropic .",
    "the boundary conditions on the system will generally not be isotropic , however , so there is no reason to expect that the pre - stressed state about which the response function should ultimately be calculated should have isotropic stress .",
    "the generic situation described by the discrete dfcn theory presented here is one in which an intrinsically isotropic material is subjected to loading forces that generate anisotropic distributions of stress chains . because different degrees of anisotropy correspond to different fixed points of the full nonlinear theory and hence to different linearizations , the pre - stressed state may have a profound influence on the response function .",
    "this is in contrast to an ordinary elastic medium , in which the response function is not affected by an anisotropic background stress .",
    "the solutions for higher @xmath164 have features that seem a bit unlikely from a physical standpoint , though not obviously unacceptable . for @xmath187",
    ", we have higher orders of anisotropy , with @xmath75 exhibiting additional maxima and minima as a function of @xmath73 at each @xmath87 , but still with monotonic decay at large @xmath87 . for @xmath188 ,",
    "the eigenvalues are negative , which causes @xmath189 and hence @xmath75 to oscillate as @xmath87 varies . whether or not these solutions are relevant hinges on the question of which boundary conditions are associated with generic physical systems .      given several families of homogeneous solutions , it is natural to ask which solution will be selected for a given set of boundary conditions . from a mathematical perspective , this is a straightforward question . as described in detail for the 6-fold case in reference  @xcite , the only way to specify boundary conditions on eq .",
    "( [ eqn : discrete ] ) that are sure to be self - consistent and not produce negative chain densities is to specify the densities of only the ingoing chains at each boundary . in general",
    ", the densities specified will not match perfectly any of the homogeneous solutions @xmath75 for all @xmath87 and @xmath73 , even if horizontal translational symmetry is assumed .",
    "based on experience with the 6-fold case , we might expect the trajectory in the space of @xmath75 as the slab is traversed to quickly approach a fixed point and stay near it over a substantial portion of the slab , then make a rapid transition to the vicinity of another fixed point , and finally move off to a point consistent with the bottom boundary condition .",
    "the details of the transition regions and selection of the fixed point remain to be worked out in the present case .    from a physical perspective , the situation is not so clear . consider the following two possible choices of boundary conditions for the top surface . in both cases ,",
    "assume that @xmath92 for all ingoing @xmath82 except the ones specified as follows : ( bc1 ) @xmath190 ; and ( bc2 ) @xmath191 .",
    "assume also that the boundary conditions on the bottom slab are simple reflections of these through the horizontal .",
    "thus we have boundary conditions with the same total stress stipulated , but in one case it is injected via a sparse set of strong forces , and in the other via a denser set of weaker forces .",
    "these conditions will _ not _ necessarily lead to the same fixed points in the bulk .",
    "since the chain densities are measured with respect to the intrinsic length scale @xmath25 , bc1 and bc2 are not simply related by a scale transformation .",
    "we therefore expect them to lead to fixed points corresponding to different @xmath134 s , which implies that they will require different rescalings of @xmath179 .",
    "this in turn indicates that the force scales fixed by the two different boundary conditions differ , in spite of the fact that they correspond to specifying the same overall force .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox lies in the fact that the boundary conditions do not specify the densities of the _ outgoing _ chains .",
    "ultimately , the force scale must be determined by the @xmath192 component of the stress , which must be constant throughout the slab ; i.e. , @xmath193 must determine the prescribed rescaling of @xmath179 .",
    "but the densities of outgoing chains produced by bc1 and bc2 will differ , which will cause @xmath193 to differ in the two cases . in order to determine @xmath193 , which is the total pressure applied to the top surface",
    ", we must first determine the full solution , or at least which fixed point the trajectory approaches .",
    "the converse situation , in which the stress is specified but not the individual chain densities , is more familiar , but just as subtle .",
    "one might expect it to be sufficient to specify some components of the stress tensor and its spatial derivatives on the top boundary and others on the bottom , but the dfcn equations require independent specifications of densities of chains of many directions and strengths . in an experiment in which a granular material is put under compression between to flat plates , it is not at all clear how the chains densities at the boundaries are determined . both the distribution over directions @xmath73 and strengths @xmath87 are relevant",
    ". an important topic of future research will be to develop a method of assigning directions to force chains observed in experimental images or numerical models , and to learn from them how the boundary conditions appear to be imposed .",
    "in this paper we have exhibited for the first time solutions of the boltzmann  equation for the chain densities in a model that permits the interaction of chains of different intensities .",
    "these solutions have highly nontrivial structure that raises a number of interesting questions .",
    "most importantly , they permit calculations of both stresses and single particle force distributions in a unified way . refinement of the model is clearly necessary : we would like to avoid divergences in the density of weak chains ; and we would like to generalize the splitting and fusion functions , which might bring the single contact force distribution @xmath194 into closer agreement with experiment .",
    "nevertheless , there is much to be gained from further study of the models presented here , or minor modifications of them .",
    "the availability of closed form analytic solutions suggests that a complete theory of the stress configurations and response functions for these particular models is within reach .",
    "in addition , it appears possible that the linearized theory in the vicinity of the fixed points presented here could lead to a new derivation of constitutive relations for closing the equilibrium equations for the macroscopic stresses .",
    "finally , the solutions presented here may provide a basis for extensions to similar discrete models in which more than one type of vertex structure is allowed .",
    "all of these topics are currently under study.@xcite the author looks forward to continued collaboration with david schaeffer on these topics , as he is certain to offer valuable insights and pose questions that lead to fruitful calculations .",
