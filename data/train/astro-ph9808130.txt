    "the cdm simulation uses 16.8 million particles while the lcdm has 2.1 million . as expected , the squares fall slightly below the circles at small separation due to the larger force softening in the big - box simulations , whereas the circles fall below the squares at comoving separation @xmath77 mpc due to their smaller box size . in the intermediate regime , however , the results agree well between the two runs that have very different particle numbers , box sizes , and force resolution .",

    "this non - power - law behavior of @xmath0 of the density field , however , should not be viewed as an inconsistency with observations .",
    "the @xmath0 computed from halos discussed in the next section bears closer reality to the observed @xmath0 for galaxies , and as will be shown , the shape of halo - halo @xmath0 is indeed well approximated by a power law .    in the intermediate range between 1 and @xmath81 comoving mpc ,",
    "figures  1 to 3 show the interesting feature that the nonlinear @xmath0 dips below the linear @xmath0 before rising rapidly above it on smaller scales .",
    "the decrement is present only at @xmath82 , but it becomes more prominent and extends over a larger range of @xmath69 as time goes on .",
    "this feature is not due to numerical artifacts in the simulations ( such as small box size or statistical fluke ) because it is seen in all models , in both 100 mpc and 640 mpc simulations with different resolution and realization , and in both @xmath0 computed from the particles ( i.e. circles and squares ) and that computed from integration of the analytical nonlinear @xmath8 ( i.e. solid curves ) .",
    "mathematically , despite the fact that the nonlinear @xmath8 is always larger than or equal to the linear @xmath8 ( within the @xmath83% fitting error of ma ( 1998 ) ) , the nonlinear @xmath0 can fall below the linear @xmath0 for a limited range of @xmath69 because the factor @xmath84 in equation  ( [ xi ] ) is oscillatory .",
    "physically , the decrement may reflect the depletion of matter on quasi - linear scales that is fueling the process of gravitational infalls in more clustered regions on smaller scales .",
    "the decrement also implies that the nonlinear correlation lengths evolve more slowly than the linear predictions , which contributes to the slower evolution of the halo - halo @xmath0 to be discussed in the next section .",
    "this interesting feature may warrant further analytical study .",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 on the expansion factor @xmath85 is related to the growth rate of @xmath8 , a well understood phenomenon in the linear regime . for the standard cdm model ,",
    "the linear @xmath9 and @xmath0 both grow as @xmath86 . for c+hdm models",
    ", the linear @xmath9 and @xmath0 also increase as @xmath86 above the neutrino free - streaming scale , but the growth is retarded below this scale because the phase - mixing of neutrinos reduces the density perturbations . an accurate analytic approximation ( with @xmath83% error ) for this scale - dependent effect",
    "is given by equation  ( 11 ) of ma ( 1996 ) .",
    "for critically - flat lcdm models , the linear @xmath9 and @xmath0 again grow as @xmath86 until the universe becomes @xmath87-dominated at @xmath88 .",
    "after this epoch , the growth is slowed down ( heath 1977 ) .",
    "however , unlike the c+hdm models in which the neutrino free - streaming imprints a characteristic scale , the retardation of the linear growth rate in the lcdm model is independent of length scales . in the nonlinear regime , the evolution of @xmath0 for the density field in the cdm model has been discussed in jain ( 1997 ) and matarrese et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .      in order to determine the correlations of the simulated halos , the denmax algorithm ( gelb & bertschinger 1994ab ; ma & bertschinger 1994b ; frederic 1995ab )",
    "is first used to identify dark matter halos in the output of the simulations .",
    "the denmax algorithm is designed to associate particles with density peaks by moving the particles along the gradient of the mass density field until they settle into the peaks .",
    "the density field is first computed on a very fine grid from the particle positions using the triangular - shaped cloud interpolation scheme ( hockney & eastwood 1988 ) , and then convolved with a gaussian filter to remove grid effects .",
    "after the particles are associated with density peaks by denmax , the energy of the particles in each halo is computed and the unbound ones are removed .",
    "an overdensity of 200 is also imposed to select virialized halos that are potential galaxy hosts . due to the small smoothing length required for identifying galactic - size halos ( typically 1/1000th the box length ) ,",
    "this method is more cpu - intensive than the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm used in previous numerical studies of halo - halo correlation functions ( e.g. , brainerd & villumsen 1994 ; colin et al .",
    "the denmax algorithm is chosen here , however , because extensive tests have demonstrated that it generally identifies distinct density concentrations more reliably than the fof algorithm , for which an arbitrary linking length must be assigned ( gelb & bertschinger 1994ab ; frederic 1995ab ) .",
    "all dissipationless simulations suffer to some degree the overmerging problem in regions of high overdensities .",
    "when individual dark matter halos merge in these simulations , they form a larger , smooth halo with little substructure due to the lack of dissipation .",
    "the extent of this problem can be quantified by examining output of hydrodynamic simulations , which are designed to follow both the dark matter and a gas component that is allowed to cool and condense to high densities .",
    "massive dark matter halos of the size of galaxy clusters in these simulations have been seen to host multiple subclumps of condensed gas  presumably the sites of galaxies  that had survived the merger due to their high densities and small cross sections ( e.g. , katz et al .",
    "1992 ; evrard et al .",
    "it is not easy to identify galactic halos in such highly clustered regions from the dark matter distribution alone , and various methods have been proposed to locate galactic sites in clusters in @xmath89-body simulations .",
    "however , tests against hydrodynamical simulations have so far indicated that no method proves satisfactory on cluster scales ( summers et al .",
    "1995 ) .    outside of the dense cluster environment ,",
    "on the other hand , dark matter halos identified by reliable algorithms in @xmath89-body simulations have been found to give robust predictions for galaxy clustering statistics .",
    "for the two - point correlation function , for example , summers et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found good agreement between @xmath0 determined from dark matter halos and from the gas in hydrodynamical simulations on scales above 1 mpc , and most halo identification methods gave consistent results ( see their fig .",
    "gelb & bertschinger ( 1994b ) studied two break - up methods that were designed to reconstruct the galactic substructure in clusters by splitting the massive halos in @xmath89-body simulations into multiple sub - halos .",
    "the amplitude of the two - point correlation was indeed boosted significantly on scales below 1 mpc due to the break - up procedure . on scales above 1 mpc , however , both the shape and the correlation length were hardly changed whether the massive halos were split up or not ( see their figs .",
    "9 and 10 ) .",
    "these studies all indicate that the overmerging problem in @xmath89-body simulations is confined to scales of @xmath90 comoving mpc and below ; it therefore does not affect the determination of the correlation length ( discussed in the next section ) .",
    "moreover , most measurements of @xmath0 are based on surveys of galaxies in blank fields devoid of massive clusters ( e.g. shepherd et al .",
    "1997 ; le fevre et al . 1996 ; carlberg et al .",
    "the problem with galaxy identification in the cluster environment therefore should not be of serious concern to this study .",
    "figures  46 show the resulting two - point correlation functions of the resolved halos determined from our simulations .",
    "five models  the standard cdm ( fig .  4 ) ,",
    "the @xmath74 and 0.5 lcdm models ( fig .  5 ) , and the @xmath49 and 0.2 c+hdm ( fig .  6 )  are shown for comparison . for each model , the figures illustrate the redshift evolution by plotting @xmath0 from @xmath91 up to 4 .",
    "the left and right panels are computed from virialized halos in two mass ranges , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "these two different mass limits are chosen to illustrate the dependence of @xmath0 on halo populations .",
    "the figures show that the more massive halos have a higher correlation amplitude and length .",
    "since the observed @xmath0 is determined from field galaxies not associated with massive clusters ( as discussed above ) , i have tested the effects of massive halos on the determination of @xmath0 by imposing an upper mass cut of @xmath94 .",
    "due to the rarity of these high - mass objects , @xmath0 is found to depend little on whether these objects are included in the sample or not . for simplicity , such an upper mass cut",
    "will therefore not be imposed in the results reported here .",
    "as figures  4 - 6 show , the shapes of the halo - halo @xmath0 do not depend noticeably on the models or the halo mass cuts . in contrary to @xmath0 for the density field ( figs  1 to 3 ) , the halo - halo @xmath0 is well approximated by a power law with the observed slope of @xmath95 between 1 and @xmath81 comoving mpc . on scales of below @xmath96 comoving mpc , @xmath0 starts to flatten out as @xmath97 approaches 0 in the cdm and @xmath72 lcdm models that have relatively large small - scale power .",
    "this behavior largely reflects the over - merging problem in dissipationless simulations discussed above .",
    "the flattening of @xmath0 disappears when either halo break - up procedures are applied ( e.g. , gelb & bertschinger 1994b ) or gas particles are used as galaxy tracers .",
    "since the shape of @xmath0 carries little information about the underlying cosmogony , no attempts will be made here to correct for the flattening of @xmath0 on small scales .",
    "instead , the focus of this study is on the more interesting quantity , the correlation length and its evolution .",
    "they are determined by the reliable part of @xmath0 at @xmath98 mpc and are largely unaffected by the overmerging problem .",
    "comparison of the two - point correlation function for halos in figures  4 - 6 to that for the density field in figures  1 - 3 shows that the evolution of the halo - halo @xmath0 is markedly slower than the matter density field in all models .",
    "relative to the density field , the clustering amplitude of halos is higher at @xmath99 , but it invariably drops below that of the density field by @xmath91 due to the slow evolution .",
    "such `` anti - biasing '' effect has been noted in previous studies of the cdm model ( gelb & bertschinger 1994b ; colin et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the present study shows that this effect occurs in lcdm and c+hdm models as well .",
    "it is attributed to the continuous disruption and mergers of halos at late times that reduce the clustering of halos to below that of the mass .",
    "the relationship between the density field and the halos shows complicated dependence on both length and time scales and on cosmological parameters .",
    "care must therefore be taken not to compare @xmath0 for the density field to the observed @xmath0 since the former does not reflect directly the observed clustering properties of galaxies .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 for halos depends strongly on the cosmological parameters .",
    "figure  7 shows the redshift dependence of the physical correlation length @xmath100 for the simulated halos for two mass ranges in all five models .",
    "the fastest growth occurs in the pure cdm model , in which the physical correlation length @xmath3 increases by a factor of 8 from @xmath101 to 0 .",
    "the correlation length changes more mildly in the lcdm and c+hdm models .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 increases by a factor of 3 from @xmath102 to 0 in the @xmath55 model and a factor of 5.4 from @xmath101 to 0 in the @xmath74 lcdm model .",
    "when expressed in comoving coordinates , the halo - halo @xmath0 in fact decreases with time at higher redshifts and is seen to rise only at a later time ( see also brainerd and villumsen 1994 ; bagla 1997 ) .",
    "however , one should be careful not to interpret this behavior as actual decrease in the physical clustering amplitude at early times : as figures  4 to 7 clearly illustrate , the physical @xmath3 and @xmath7 always increase monotonically with time in all models .",
    "instead , the decrease merely reflects the fact that the halo clustering rate is slower than the state of fixed clustering in comoving coordinates early on .",
    "it eventually surpasses fixed comoving clustering when the comoving correlation length begins to increase ( see fig .  8 below ) .",
    "the top panels of figure  7 illustrate that @xmath3 increases more slowly in models with smaller @xmath1 .",
    "this feature is consistent with the slower growth of structure in low - density models .",
    "the lower panels compare different c+hdm models and indicate that larger @xmath2 models show slower evolution .",
    "this can be explained by the slower growth due to the large neutrino free - streaming effects in high-@xmath2 models .",
    "the left and right panels of figure  7 illustrate that @xmath3 also depends on the minimal halo mass selected for the sample , and is larger for the more massive halos ( right panels ) due to their high clustering amplitudes .    to quantify the evolution of the two - point correlation function with redshift , i find it most convenient to parameterize the physical and comoving correlation lengths directly as @xmath103 the parameter @xmath104 itself increases with time because as figure  7 illustrates , the slope of @xmath100 generally steepens as @xmath97 decreases , and the rate of change depends on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the form of equation  ( [ r0x0 ] ) is chosen to improve the power - law parameterization commonly used in the literature , where both the shape and redshift dependence of @xmath0 are written as power laws with exponents @xmath105 and @xmath106 : @xmath107 and @xmath69 is the pair separation in physical coordinates .",
    "it follows from equation  ( [ xir ] ) that the physical and comoving correlation length evolve as @xmath108 as figure  7 illustrates , however , the power - law redshift dependence in equation  ( [ r0 ] ) does not hold over the redshift range 0 to 4 for any model .",
    "moreover , since the parameter @xmath106 in equation  ( [ xir ] ) was introduced to characterize the redshift evolution of @xmath0 and not @xmath3 , the evolution of @xmath3 depends inconveniently on both @xmath106 and @xmath105 .",
    "the simple form of equation  ( [ r0x0 ] ) will therefore be used here . to translate @xmath104 into the parameter @xmath106 used in the literature , use @xmath109    some useful theoretical predictions for the evolution of @xmath0 are : ( 1 )",
    "the linear theory predicts @xmath110 for the standard cdm model , corresponding to @xmath111 , or @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath114 ; ( 2 ) clustering fixed in comoving coordinates corresponds to @xmath115 , implying @xmath116 , or @xmath117 ; ( 3 ) stable clustering in physical space corresponds to @xmath118 , and therefore @xmath119 , or @xmath120 .",
    "figure  8 shows @xmath121 for the simulated halos in our study .",
    "the rise of @xmath121 with time indicates that the halo correlation length @xmath3 grows faster than a simple power law with a constant @xmath106 assumed in the literature ( as seen in figure  7 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath121 also depends on both cosmological parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the label on the right along the vertical axis marks the corresponding @xmath106 when @xmath24 is assumed for the slope of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath104 crosses unity in a given model , it indicates that gravitational clustering has become faster than no evolution in comoving space ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) .",
    "this epoch corresponds to the turn - around redshift at which the initially falling @xmath0 first starts to increase in comoving space . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the cdm , @xmath72 lcdm , and @xmath49 c+hdm models all approach the stable clustering regime of @xmath120 , whereas the @xmath74 lcdm model exhibits less rapid evolution of @xmath122 .",
    "stable clustering has also been seen for the density field on small scales in the pure cdm model and models with scale - free spectra ( jain 1997 ) .",
    "our study here shows that halos also approach stable clustering in high-@xmath1 models .",
    "the only detailed numerical study of the evolution of halo - halo @xmath0 thus far is colin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , in which the @xmath43 and @xmath44 cdm models are examined .",
    "but as discussed in  1 , the @xmath43 cdm results reported here can not be compared directly to theirs because of their choice of high hubble constant @xmath45 and large value of the shape parameter @xmath46 .",
    "since the standard cdm model with @xmath48 used in this paper already suffers from the well - known excess small - scale power , a model with @xmath46 would produce even more power and worsen the problem",
    ". this may be the main cause of the steep slope @xmath123 to 2.4 for @xmath0 in table 2 of colin et al .",
    ", which is significantly larger than the value of @xmath124 found here and in other works .",
    "one should also note that because @xmath100 depends on both @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ r0 ] ] ) , their high values of @xmath105 lead to the large positive @xmath106 in their figure  9 ( where @xmath106 ranges from @xmath125 at @xmath126 to 1.5 at @xmath127 ) .",
    "when expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath104 introduced earlier , their large values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 do cancel out to some extent , giving @xmath122 at @xmath126 and 1.87 at @xmath91 , but it is still significantly larger than our @xmath106 in figure  8 .",
    "motivated by the extensive observational effort toward determining the evolution of the two - point correlation function @xmath7 , i have presented a detailed theoretical study of the the redshift dependence of @xmath0 in five cosmological models with varying mass density @xmath1 and neutrino fraction @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution is found to be much more intricate than the simple power - law parameterization of @xmath106 commonly assumed in the literature , and a redshift - dependent variable @xmath104 is introduced to quantify the evolution of the correlation length : @xmath128 .",
    "the value of @xmath121 depends strongly on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and is smaller in models with lower @xmath1 or higher @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "8) , indicating a slower growth in @xmath3 . within a given model ,",
    "@xmath104 increases with time , passing the phase of fixed comoving clustering ( @xmath116 ) at @xmath4 to 3 toward stable clustering ( @xmath120 ) at @xmath5 .",
    "although the two - point correlation function @xmath0 provides a fundamental statistical measure of gravitational clustering , care must be taken in specifying the underlying quantity that is being measured and in including the possible nonlinear effects .",
    "this study has demonstrated that @xmath0 for the matter density field and dark matter halos have different shapes and evolve with different rates . while the local slope of @xmath0 for the nonlinear density field changes with length scales ( figs .  1 to 3 ) , the shape of the halo - halo @xmath0 is well approximated by a power law with the observed slope of @xmath95 independent of cosmological parameters ( figs .",
    "it is therefore the redshift evolution of the amplitude of @xmath0 that will reveal the most about cosmogonies .",
    "since halos generally correspond to galaxy sites ( except in dense cluster environment ) , @xmath0 for halos in simulations is a reasonable quantity to compare with observations .",
    "the correlation function for the density field provides important insight for theoretical studies of gravitational clustering , but it bears little direct relevance to the observed clustering of galaxies .    on the observational side , ongoing deep redshift surveys of galaxies that cover larger areas of the sky should soon yield more robust determination of @xmath0 beyond @xmath39 .",
    "photometric redshifts determined from multi - color surveys and the two - point angular correlation function also offer complimentary measurements of @xmath0 ( connolly , szalay , & brunner 1998 ; postman et al . 1998 ; and references therein ) .",
    "we are currently analyzing galaxy clustering properties in two redshift surveys conducted with the norris spectrograph on the palomar 200-inch telescope ( small et al .",
    "the combined surveys have more than 1000 galaxies in @xmath129 . the implications of the theoretical results presented here will be discussed in small et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "although the evolution of @xmath0 has already been counted as yet another strike against @xmath43 models ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) , it must be borne in mind that the nature of high - redshift galaxies has only begun to be unravelled , and that little is known about their dark matter halos . due to the large uncertainties in the current observational results and theoretical understanding in galaxy evolution ,",
    "this paper has chosen to investigate the evolution of @xmath0 using simulated dark matter halos within well defined mass ranges .",
    "it is nonetheless conceivable that measurements of @xmath0 at higher redshifts are probing different galaxy populations that are not fair counterparts of the local galaxies .",
    "based on future observations , one should be able to refine the theoretical predictions made in this paper by incorporating different dark matter halo populations at higher redshifts .",
    "the author thanks jim frederic and todd small for valuable discussions .",
