    "quasars typically emit @xmath550% of their bolometric luminosity in a spectral component generally believe to peak in the extreme uv , but encompassing the optical to soft x - ray bands ( e.g. sanders et al 1989 ) .",
    "this emission is believed to be closely related to the accretion flow onto the putative supermassive black hole powering the copious energy output ( @xmath10 ) of quasars ( eg .",
    "zeldovich & novikov 1964 ) .",
    "the remainder of the bolometric luminosity , however , is emitted with almost constant power per decade of frequency over two other broad ranges of frequencies in the infrared and x - ray band ( eg . carleton et al 1987 ) .",
    "the origin of this emission is less clear , yet it is clearly related in some way to the presence of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of all quasars in the infrared to hard x - ray band are somewhat similar .",
    "however quasars can be divided into two classes based on the strength of the radio emission relative to that in the optical band , hence radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars ( hereafter rqqs and rlqs respectively ) .    the x - ray band ( 0.150  kev ) is thought to contain @xmath51030% of the bolometric luminosity of most quasars .",
    "despite two decades of study we have only a crude idea of the x - ray spectrum of the average quasar .",
    "the spectrum appears to be dominated by a simple power law continuum at energies @xmath11few  kev ( quasar frame ) , but steepens at energies @xmath121  kev .",
    "the power law is thought to be related to the underlying non - thermal emission whilst the soft x - ray component to be the high energy tail of the ( psuedo - thermal ? ) uv bump .",
    "both components are known to be variable and hence diagnostics of the ultimate energy release mechanism(s ) .",
    "additional spectral features such as absorption by material intrinsic to the source , fe @xmath9-shell emission and compton - reflection components , so useful as diagnostics in the case of seyfert galaxies , appear to be rare in quasars ( eg .",
    "reeves et al 1997 ) . in many respects ,",
    "our knowledge of the x - ray characteristics of quasars is reminiscent of our knowledge of the lower - luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies a decade or so ago .",
    "most of the studies in the x - ray band conducted to date have been performed using small or incomplete samples of sources and/or using instruments of low spectral resolution and limited bandpass .",
    "nevertheless many studies have suggested that rlqs have flatter spectra than rqqs throughout the x - ray band . modelling the spectra of 33 quasars in the 0.13.5  kev ( observed frame )",
    "band obtained using the _ einstein _  ipc with a power law ( corrected for line - of - sight absorption ) , wilkes & elvis ( 1987 ) found mean values of the photon indices of @xmath13 for rqqs and @xmath14 for rlqs .",
    "such a trend has been confirmed from other studies of a larger number of sources with the ipc ( e.g. canizares & white 1989 ) .",
    "similar modelling of the spectra in the 0.12.4  kev ( observed frame ) band obtained using the _ rosat _  pspc reveal steeper still spectral indices , but again with @xmath15 greater than @xmath16 ( eg .",
    "laor et al 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "some studies using _ exosat _ , _ ginga _ and _ asca _  have suggested rlqs also have flatter spectra than rqqs at energies @xmath17  kev ( e.g. williams et al 1992 ; lawson et al 1992 ; reeves et al 1997 ) .",
    "however more recent studies have disputed this , suggesting @xmath181.8 ( lawson & turner 1997 ; sambruna , eracleous & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "it should be remembered that almost all the above studies note a wide dispersion in spectral indices within both rlqs and rqqs : there appears to be no generic quasar spectrum in the x - ray band .",
    "our original motivation of the current project was to observe a well - defined sample of pg - quasars using a single satellite ( _ asca _ ; tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) .",
    "we planned to compare the temporal and spectral characteristics in the 0.510  kev ( observed frame ) band to other parameters such as @xmath19 , redshift , luminosity _ etc _ in a sample where at least the obvervational selection effects were known .",
    "unfortunately time was not awarded for the entire project .    here",
    "we present the results of 27 _ asca _",
    "observations of 26 rqqs .",
    "the sources were selected from the pg - quasars ( see  [ sec : sample ] ) , with our own observations supplemented by archival data .",
    "the resultant sample is by no means statistically complete .",
    "however the sample is reasonably representative of the optical and radio characteristics of the rqqs in the pg - survey as a whole .",
    "thus we may assume the _ asca _  results provide a reasonable representation of the x - ray characteristics of the rqqs in the pg - survey .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our discussion to the _ asca _  results , postponing comparison with previous x - ray observations and other multiwaveband characteristics until george et al 2000 ( hereafter paper ii ) . in ",

    "the palomar  green ( pg ) survey of stellar  like objects with ultraviolet excess ( @xmath20 ) covers a survey area approximately a quarter of the sky ( schmidt & green 1983 ; green , schmidt , liebert 1986 ) .",
    "the survey contains a statistically - complete sample of 1715 objects of which 116 are classified as either quasars or seyfert galaxies .",
    "the subdivision between quasars and seyfert galaxies is based solely upon whether the absolute @xmath21-magnitude is greater or less than @xmath22  mag . in the current work",
    "we make no such distinction and , for simplicity , refer to both types of object as quasars .",
    "the optical and infrared continua of 98 of the pg - quasars have been presented in neugebauer et al ( 1987 ) .",

    "it was found that the majority of the sources had @xmath26 , but that @xmath27% of the sources had @xmath28 .",
    "this led to the common classification into rqqs and rlqs , with the most frequently used division at @xmath29 .",
    "the sample considered in this paper consists of all the radio - quiet pg - quasars for which the _ asca _  data are available to us ( as of 1999 jul 01 ) .",

    "all fluxes and luminosities quoted below ( but _ not _ count rates ) have been corrected for the fraction of the source photons falling outside the source extraction cells .",
    "light curves of the source region were constructed for each observation using xronos ( v4.02 ) and several bin sizes ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "this formulism requires there is a sufficient number of counts ( @xmath51 ) in each bin such that gaussian statistics are applicable , and that there is an adquate number of such bins ( @xmath52 ) .",

    "spectra were extracted from the source and background regions for each instrument as defined in  [ sec : spatial - xtractcells ] . in the case of the sis data , the original pulse - height assignment for each event was converted to a pulse - invariant ( pi ) scale using sispi ( v1.1 ) and the gain - history file ` sisph2pi_110397.fits ` . in the case of the gis data",
    "hard particle flares were rejected using the so - called ho2 count rate , and standard rise - time rejection criteria .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed using the xspec ( v10.00 ) package ( arnaud 1996 ) , having first grouped the raw spectra such that each bin contained @xmath62 counts permitting us to use @xmath63 minimization techniques . in the case of the gis datasets , the detector redistribution matrices released on 1995 mar 06 were used . in the case of the sis datasets ,",
    "appropriate detector redistribution matrices were generated using sisrmg ( v1.1 ) .",
    "the effective area appropriate for each dataset was calculated using ascaarf ( v2.72 ) .",
    "following common practice , for each observation we fit the spectra from all four instruments simultaneously , but allowing an independent normalization of the model for each detector to account differences in the absolute flux calibrations .",
    "all fluxes and luminosities quoted for the sources are derived ( arbitrarily ) using the sis0 detector .",
    "the corresponding errors represent only the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the luminosities were calculated assuming the preferred model discussed below ( with the errors derived by allowing only the normalizations of the spectral components to vary ) .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of the instruments on _ asca _  is believed to be uncertain by at least @xmath55% .",
    "we use a number of criteria to establish whether we consider a model to be consistent with a given dataset . during the spectral analysis we use the @xmath63-statistic ( in conjunction with the number of degrees - of - freedom , @xmath64 ) to determine the goodness - of - fit over the energy range used during the analysis . to this end",
    ", we use the probability , @xmath65 , that the statistic should be less than the observed value of @xmath63 under the assumption that the model is indeed the true representation of the data .",
    "thus @xmath66 corresponds to a reduced@xmath63 value of unity and values of @xmath67 indicate that the data are poorly represented by the model . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we consider the model to be an adequate description of the data if @xmath68    data from the sis below 0.6 kev ( observer  frame ) were excluded from the spectral analysis due to uncertainties associated with the calibration of the sis detectors below this energy .",
    "however , although the calibration is suspect at these energies , it is generally considered that the amplitude of the error is @xmath69% ( e.g. orr et al 1998 ) .",
    "thus , following george et al ( 1998a ) , we make use of this fact by extrapolating our best - fitting models to energies @xmath70  kev and calculating the ratio of the increase in the @xmath63-statistic to the number of addition data points ( @xmath71 ) , and the mean data / model ratio for data points below 0.6  kev ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we consider models which give @xmath73 _ and _ @xmath72 outside the range 0.81.2 disagree with the data at a level unlikely to be the result of any calibration uncertainties .",
    "such cases are noted and discussed in the text .",
    "[ sec : ux - definition ]    in this section we consider the form of the x - ray continuum .",
    "the goals are to obtain the simplest parametrization of the continuum consistent with the data .",
    "thus we exclude the 57  kev energy band from the analysis , postponing the investigation of any fe @xmath9-shell emission until  [ sec : fe - band ] .",
    "we first compare the data to three standard spectral models in which the underlying continuum is assumed to be a single power law . these and all other models considered in this paper include galactic absorption _ fixed _ at the effective hydrogen column density ( @xmath33 ) derived from 21  cm measurements along the appropriate line - of - sight as given in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we use the abundances and cross - sections given in morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) and hence assume no variations in the abundances of heavy elements within the ism .",
    "our simplest model consists of only the power law .",
    "this model , hereafter refered to as * model  a * , has only one interesting parameter : @xmath74 , the photon index of the power law .",
    "* model  b * is a single power law , absorbed by a column of neutral material at the redshift of the quasar ( @xmath75 ) completely covering the cylinder  of  sight .",
    "this model has two interesting parameters : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "* model  c * is as for model  b , but with the absorbing material is assumed to be photoionized .",
    "the ionized  absorber models used in this paper were generated using the photoionization code ion ( netzer 1993 , 1996 , version ion97 ) .",
    "the models are those used in george et al ( 1998a ) , except that here we parameterize the ionization state of the gas by a somewhat different ionization parameter defined as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the monochromatic luminosity at energy @xmath78 , @xmath79 the distance from the source to the absorbing material , and @xmath80 the number density of the absorber ( in all cases assumed to be @xmath81 ) .",
    "the reasoning for using this version of the ionization parameter is that the form of the continuum at energies below the oxygen k - edge ( 538  ev for oi ) have only a minor effect on the strength of the oxygen absorption features that are used to determine the ionization parameter and absorbing column .",
    "model  c therefore has three interesting parameters : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath82 .    as will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec:0.6 - 10-observed ] , for many of the datasets , models  a  c do not provide an adequate description of the continuum over the full 0.610  kev ( observed - frame ) band . in most such cases",
    ", there appears a gradual steepening of the continuum with decreasing energy .",
    "this may not be considered surprizing given the evidence for soft excesses in previous observations of quasars .",
    "unfortunately however , modelling ( sometimes rather subtle ) deviations from a powerlaw due to a convex continuum are rather problematic using _ asca _ data given the limited bandpass and the moderate spectral resolution of the instruments .",
    "thus , it is not clear what functional form is most appropriate to model the soft x - ray emission , especially since the excesses appear to be different in different sources .",
    "here we have adopted two functional forms to parameterize such convex continua .",
    "the first is by introducing a second power law . in *",
    "model  d * the underlying continuum is therefore the sum of two power laws , both absorbed by a column of neutral material at the redshift of the quasar and completely covering the cylinder  of  sight .",
    "the photon indices for the soft and hard power laws are denoted by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and the relative intensity of the components by the ratio ( @xmath85 ) of the soft to hard power laws at 1  kev ( quasar - frame ) .",

    "model  e * is as for model  d except the absorbing material is photoionized . ] , giving a fifth interesting parameter , @xmath82 .",
    "the alternative functional form used to parameterize the soft excesses is a gaussian emission component .",
    "thus * model  f * consists of a single power law plus a gaussian peaking at an energy @xmath86 , of width @xmath87 and total luminosity @xmath88 . as will be further discussed in  [ sec:0.6 - 10-observed ] , model  f is the preferred model for a number of datasets where the gaussian component models only small deviations from a pure power law in the 0.62  kev ( observed - frame ) band . in at least some cases this may be an artifact of remaining calibration uncertainties or an indicator of more subtle spectral complexity ( see also  [ sec : disc-1kev ] ) .    since the objects in our sample have a range of redshifts , the useable 0.610  kev _ asca _ band covers different energy bands in the quasar frame in each object ( @xmath5220  kev in the most extreme case of pg  1247 - 267 ) .",
    "thus in  [ sec:2 - 10 ] we consider the form of the continuum in the 210  kev band , which enables us to make direct comparisons between the objects .",
    "then in  [ sec:0.6 - 10-observed ] we consider the form of the full 0.610  kev ( observed - frame ) continuum .",
    "this obviously enables us to study the low - energy spectra of the objects with the lower redshifts and the high - energy spectra of those with higher redshifts .",
    "we note that the during the spectral analysis presented below , different portions ( in energy - space ) of the detectors response functions are used for objects of different redshift .",
    "if the sources have simple spectra across the fitted band , then this is not a concern so long as there is a section of well - constrained data from which to determine the photon index .",
    "if the sources have spectral curvature within the fitted band but are modeled using a simple power law , then the well - constrained data will occur across different parts of the curved spectrum , and could yield a false correlation between photon index and redshift , and a false distribution of photon indices .",

    "_ , ionized material along the line  of  sight can be detected primarily by bound - free absorption edges of ovii ( 739  ev ) and oviii ( 871  ev ) imprinted in the continuum .",
    "recent observations have shown that a large fraction of low - luminosity agn contain such material with implied column densities in the range @xmath155 ( eg . reynolds 1997 ; george et al 1998a ) .",
    "for example , of the 12 rq objects with @xmath111(210  kev)@xmath156 considered by george et al ( 1998a ) , 11 were found to contain evidence for ionized material .    in additional to that presented in  [ sec:0.6 - 10-observed ] , we have performed a spectral analysis of each dataset in which the model includes both ovii and oviii edges . in each case",
    "these edges were added to the preferred continuum ( having first set @xmath75 to zero in the case of models  c and e ) .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab:2edges ] .",
    "fig  [ fig:2edge]a shows the sum of optical depths in these edges ( @xmath157(ovii@xmath158(oviii ) ) as a function of signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "only upper limits on the optical depths are obtained for the majority of the rqqs .",
    "a similar analysis was also carried out of the objects in the george et al sample , and the results are also shown in fig  [ fig:2edge]a .",
    "there appear to be no significant variations among the distribution of @xmath157(ovii)@xmath159(oviii ) between the two samples .",
    "as expected , the data from many of the rqqs are of relatively low signal to noise ratio . in the case of pg  1114 + 445 ,",
    "the low s / n is the result of the strong absorption edges in the spectrum .",
    "nevertheless useful constraints on the the depth of the edges can be obtained for this source . as noted above , the presence of ionized material is suggested in pg  1322 + 659 , but with a very high ionization parameter .",
    "indeed the material is so highly ionized that oxygen is almost fully stripped , resulting in only an upper limit on @xmath157(ovii)@xmath159(oviii ) .    in fig",
    "[ fig:2edge]b we plot @xmath157(ovii)@xmath159(oviii ) versus luminosity for the rqqs and george et al sample .",

    "@xmath161(210  kev)@xmath162 we find evidence for significant ovii and oviii edges in all 8 rq agn from the george et al sample , yet in only 2 of the 7 rqqs ( 4 of 10 rqqs if no threshold is imposed on s / n ) .",
    "a study of a larger , well - defined sample is required to determine whether this is a selection effect . at luminosities",

    "the george et al sample only contains 3 objects with such luminosities , one of which has significant ovii and oviii edges .",
    "a study of a larger number of objects covering a wider range of luminosity is required to determine whether the detection rate of ionized material changes as a function of luminosity .    finally in fig  [ fig : nh_vs_ionox ]",
    "we show the location of the ionized material in the @xmath75@xmath82 plane for the rqqs and the other objects in the george et al sample .",
    "we find no significant difference between the two samples .      using the same _ asca _  data reported here , leighly et al ( 1997 ) found pg  1404 + 226 to contain an absorption feature at @xmath8  kev ( observed - frame ) which they interpreted as due to oxygen in a highly relativistic outflow .",
    "ulrich et al ( 1999 ) also report the results of the same dataset and find an absorption feature at @xmath8  kev , but prefer alternative interpretations .    with our preferred model",
    "we find no requirement for such features in this object .",
    "for example adding 2 narrow absorption lines to our model at the energies found by leighly et al we obtain a reduction in @xmath63 of only 2.2 .",
    "this lack of a significant detection is in part due to the different parameterizations of the soft x - ray emission in this source used here and by leighly et al .",
    "we assume a gaussian component whilst leighly et al use a multiple black - body spectrum ( ulrich et al assume single - temperature black - body spectrum ) . these functional forms all intersect the underlying power law close to 1  kev .",
    "since the significance of the absorption features is dependent on the form of the soft x - ray spectrum , future observations with higher spectral resolution are required to verify their presence .",

    "@xmath180 is very similar in its intensity and profile to that often seen in seyfert 1 galaxies ( eg cf fig  1 in nandra et al 1997c ) , with a narrow peak at 6.4  kev ( corresponding to fei  xii ) and a broader base .",
    "the presence of a red - wing at energies below 6.4  kev is of particular interest as this is commonly interpreted as the result of relativistic effects close to the putative supermassive black hole ( eg . tanaka et al 1995 ) .",
    "unfortunately the low signal to noise ratios prevents an meaningful constraints being placed on such diskline models using the individual datasets not already studied by nandra et al ( 1997b ) .",

    "finally the mean data / model ratio for the 4 datasets with @xmath111(210  kev ) @xmath185 is consistent with unity at all energies .",
    "thus the results for the rqqs presented here confirm the results of iwasawa & taniguchi ( 1993 ) and nandra et al ( 1997c ) .",
    "we have presented the results from 25 _ asca _  observations of 24 rqqs from the pg sample .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "all but two objects ( pg  0043 + 039 & pg  1700 + 518 ) were detected .",
    "2 .   we found 15 of the datasets to have a sufficient number of counts that we were able to perform an analysis of the variability characteristics .",
    "significant variability was found in 10 of these datasets ( 9 rqqs ) at @xmath61% confidence .",
    "visual inspection of the light curves suggests 3 additional sources also exhibit variability , but the signal to noise ratios are insufficient to allow statistical testing and/or it being quantified .",
    "the variability characteristics of these rqqs were consistent with the trend found by nandra et al ( 1997a ) and turner et al ( 1999 ) whereby sources of higher luminosity sources exhibit a lower degree of variability .",
    "3 .   we found a power law offers an acceptable description of the time - averaged spectra in the 210  kev band for all but 1 of the detected sources ( pg  1411 + 442 ) .",
    "the best - fitting values of photon index vary from object to object over the range @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 is similar to that observed in other rq agn , and seems unrelated to x - ray luminosity . for the rqqs presented here",
    "we find a mean @xmath1 but with a significant dispersion @xmath2 .",
    "no single model adequately describes the full 0.610  kev ( observed - frame ) continuum of all the rqqs .",
    "we found the continua of 14 rqqs could be adequately described by a single power law ( 11 rqqs ) or a power law with only very subtle deviations ( 3 rqqs ) .",
    "the preferred model for pg  1411 + 442 has @xmath52% of the continuum escaping the nucleus directly , but the remainder attenuated by a substantial column density of material .",
    "all the remaining objects were found to have have convex spectra ( flattening as one moves to higher energies ) .",
    "we find evidence for a flattening of the continuum at energies @xmath97  kev in 5 rqqs .",
    "although there are physical explanations for such a spectral component , the _ asca _  data are unable to exclude other possibilities . 6 .",
    "six of the 10 datasets ( 5 out of 9 rqqs ) with convex spectra contain a soft excess at energies @xmath121  kev .",
    "this component was _ parameterized _ by a gaussian emission feature in the case of 3 datasets ( 3 rqqs ) and as a second power law for the remainder .",
    "a sixth rqq , pg  1148 + 549 , probably contains such a component just below the _ asca _  bandpass .",
    "there is no universal soft x - ray spectrum for rqqs .",
    "for instance , out of 14 objects with @xmath6 ( such that there is a possibility of detecting an upturn in the spectrum @xmath121  kev ) , only 5 contain a soft excess. 7 .   the spectrum of pg  1244 + 026 contains a rather narrow emission feature centered at an energy @xmath8  kev .",
    "a similar feature is present in the spectra of at least two narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we find evidence for absorption by ionized material in 6 rqqs .",
    "however we are only confident of its presence in 2 objects : pg  1114 + 445 ( with @xmath148 ) and pg  1501 + 106 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "three of the remaining rqqs have rather complex spectra raising the possibility that the presence of ionized absorber is an artifact of incorrectly modelling the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "the derived parameters of the ionized material in pg  1322 + 659 rather extreme , but require confirmation .",
    "there are indications that the detection - rate of ionized material is lower in rqqs compared to seyfert galaxies .",
    "however it is premature to make any definitive statements .",
    "9 .   our preferred model for pg  1411 + 442 ,",
    "in which a substantial column density ( @xmath4 ) obscures @xmath598  % of the continuum , and offers an explanation of the unusual optical  to  x - ray spectrum observed for this object ( paper  ii ) . 10 .",
    "we detect significant fe @xmath9-shell emission in 10 rqqs ( although there is some doubt in the case of 2 of these ) , all of which have @xmath111(210  kev)@xmath38few@xmath177 .",
    "we find the strength and energy of the emission to be consistent with that seen in other rq agn .",
    "however construction of the mean data / model ratios using all 25 datasets , but for different ranges of @xmath111(210  kev ) , reveals a trend whereby the profile and strength of the fe @xmath9-shell emission changes as a function of luminosity , consistent with previous suggestions ( iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ; nandra et al 1997c ) .",

    "<S> the spectrum of pg  1244 + 026 contains a rather narrow emission feature centered at an energy @xmath8  kev ( quasar - frame ) . the detection rate of absorption due to ionized material in these rqqs is lower in that seen in seyfert 1 galaxies . in part </S>",

    "<S> . however the construction of the mean data / model ratios for various luminosity ranges reveals a trend whereby the profile and strength of the fe @xmath9-shell emission changes as a function of luminosity . </S>"
