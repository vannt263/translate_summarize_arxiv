    "the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model describing the interaction of a two - level atom with a quantized field mode @xcite is a solvable working model of the micromaser @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the center of mass velocity of the two - level atom is slow enough to allow controlled atom by atom interaction with the field but fast enough to be described by classical physics ; e.g. thermal rydberg atoms passing through a superconducting cavity showing rabi oscillations @xcite . in the limit case of a two - level atom",
    "so slow that its center of mass motion needs to be quantized , the system is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath0 where the quantized motion of the two - level atom with unitary mass has been taken in the @xmath1-direction with associated canonical momentum @xmath2 , the quantum field is described by the annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and the frequency @xmath5 , and the inner state of the two - level atom by the pauli matrices @xmath6 with @xmath7 and the transition frequency @xmath8 .",
    "two regimes of interest can be identified for this model , depending on the ratio between the atomic kinetic energy and the field - atom interaction energy @xcite : the intermediate regime , where the mean atomic kinetic energy is of the order of the mean field - atom interaction energy , and the mazer regime , where the kinetic energy is smaller .",
    "amplification via @xmath9-motion induced emission of radiation occurs in the latter and gives origin to the mazer name @xcite .",
    "this model is of interest as cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) experiments in these two regimes appear feasible with microwave and optical quantum fields @xcite .",
    "also , it is feasible to control or switch off spin interactions of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite , as well as to address individual sites of such lattices @xcite at the moment and , in the near future , it may be possible to couple an individual site to a quantum field as cavity - qed has been demonstrated with bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    in the theoretical side of the problem ,",
    "analytic solutions are known for the mesa , @xmath10 , and sinusoidal modes @xcite .",
    "also , an adiabatic approximation has been proposed for sinusoidal and gaussian modes @xcite . here , we introduce a right unitary approach to the problem and provide an analytic solution for a quadratic mode .",
    "a quadratic mode may be related to an ultracold two - level atom approaching the maximum of a cavity field in an oblique path or trapped in a sinusoidal optical lattice . in the following section",
    ", we introduce the right unitary decomposition of the model hamiltonian for a general quantum field and construct its time evolution operator .",
    "then , we study the resonant case for quadratic couplings and provide a closed form analytic time evolution operator for the system .",
    "finally , we study the interaction of an ultracold excited atom with number and coherent states of the quantum field .",
    "by moving into the frame defined by the excitation number , @xmath11 , rotating at frequency @xmath5 , we obtain an interaction picture hamiltonian , @xmath12 where the parameter @xmath13 is the detuning between the two - level atom and field frequencies .",
    "we can follow a right unitary approach @xcite to decompose this hamiltonian into the following product , @xmath14 where we used a rotation of @xmath15 radians around the @xmath16 operator , @xmath17 and the transformation , @xmath18 the latter is right unitary , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , due to the properties of the london exponential of the phase @xcite , also known as susskind - glogower @xcite , operators , @xmath21 that yield , in the fock or number state basis , @xmath22 the new auxiliary hamiltonian is given by @xmath23 it is straightforward to use the properties of the right unitary approach @xcite and show that the evolution operator of the system is given by the following expression,@xmath24 in other words , the right unitary operators for this hamiltonian behave like a unitary operator such that @xmath25 .",
    "but the construction of an analytic closed form evolution operator for any given coupling function , @xmath26 , escapes our efforts .",
    "next , we will show that it is simple to provide such an evolution operator for quadratic potentials on - resonance .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us consider the case of an atom and cavity field on resonance , @xmath27 .",
    "note that the approach works for the off - resonant case too , and for a quadratic potential , @xmath28 we can write the auxiliary hamiltonian in the following form , @xmath29 where the standard , @xmath30 , and inverted , @xmath31 , harmonic oscillators , are equivalent to squeezed free propagation and squeezed degenerate parametric down - conversion , in that order , or equivalently , @xmath32 \\left ( \\hat{b}^{\\dagger } \\hat{b } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\right )    \\hat{s}^{\\dagger}\\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\ln \\omega(\\hat{n } ) \\right ] , \\\\ \\hat{h}_{-}&=&-\\frac{\\omega\\left(\\hat{n}\\right)}{2 }   \\hat{s}\\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\ln \\omega(\\hat{n } ) \\right ]   \\left ( \\hat{b}^{\\dagger 2 }   + \\hat{b}^{2 } \\right ) \\hat{s}^{\\dagger}\\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\ln \\omega(\\hat{n } ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we defined a frequency in terms of the number operator of the field , @xmath33 , @xmath34 also , we used a boson representation for the atomic center of mass motion , @xmath35 and the action of the squeeze operators , @xmath36 where the operator @xmath37 acts over the cavity field mode , over the position and momentum operators yields , @xmath38 note that each and every fock state of the field , @xmath39 , defines a bipartite center of mass - field mode , @xmath40 with @xmath41 and auxiliary frequency @xmath42 . as stated in the previous section , we can easily construct the evolution operator , @xmath43 with the auxiliary operators , @xmath44 e^{- i \\omega\\left ( \\hat{n } \\right ) \\left [ \\hat{b}^{\\dagger } \\hat{b } + \\frac{1}{2}\\right ]   t } \\hat{s}^{\\dagger}\\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\ln \\omega(\\hat{n } ) \\right ] , \\\\",
