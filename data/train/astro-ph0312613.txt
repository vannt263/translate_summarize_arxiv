    "it has long been an important question how galaxies form and evolve into the great variety of morphologies we see in the nearby universe .",
    "the common view is that galaxies form hierarchically from small building blocks through a sequence of merger events .",
    "this view has been motivated by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations which suggest that all galaxies form initially as discs ( e.g. baugh , cole & frenk 1996 , klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al .",
    "1999 , steinmetz & navarro 2002 , abadi et al .",
    "the signatures of the disks can subsequently be erased by multiple galaxy mergers ( barnes 1992 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider the formation of large disks through the accretion of small companions , the process often indicated as the nurture of galaxies .",
    "evidence in support of the prediction of this scenario by cold dark matter simulations has come from several directions .",
    "zaritsky ( 1995 ) and zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) determined the star formation rate of several tens of galaxies from stellar population studies .",
    "they also determined the shapes of these galaxies from photometry and found that overall the galaxies with asymmetries in their shapes have the youngest stellar populations .",
    "they acsribed this to recent accretion events .",
    "kinematic lopsidedness , observed in the 2-dimensional h0.1emi velocity fields of galaxies ( verheijen 1997 , swaters et al .",
    "1999 ) has also been considered as a result of recent minor mergers .",
    "finally there are at least some twenty examples of galaxies which in h0.1emi show either signs of interactions and/or have small companions ( sancisi 1999 ) .",
    "this suggests that galaxies often are in an environment where material for accretion is available .    even clearer evidence that accretion events play an important role",
    "has come from studies of the distribution and kinematics of stars in the milky way halo .",
    "the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) has been major proof that accretion is still taking place at the present time .",
    "since such minor merger remnants retain information about their origin for a long time ( helmi & white 2000 ) studies of the distribution and kinematics of `` stellar streams '' can in principle be used to trace the merger history of the milky way ( helmi & de zeeuw 2001 ) .",
    "such `` stellar streams '' are not only seen in the milky way , but have also been discovered in the local group galaxy m  31 ( ibata et al . 2001 , ferguson et al . 2002 , mcconnachie et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the substructure in the halo of m  31 is another piece of clear evidence that minor mergers still take place .",
    "the question now is how to trace such events in more distant galaxies , where we can not observe individual stars , but require other means of detecting the signature of accretion .",
    "the use of h0.1emi is very powerful as it can image interactions very effectively by studying the h0.1emi distributions and kinematics of nearby galaxies .",
    "examples can be found in sancisi ( 1999 ) .",
    "the improved sensitivity of modern synthesis radio telescopes brings within reach the detection of faint h0.1emi signatures of accretion events and we expect that new observations of nearby galaxies will reveal these in the coming decade . to further illustrate this point we here present a few examples of such signatures : ngc  3359 , ngc  4565 and ngc  6946 .",
    "all three galaxies have been observed recently with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) using the new front - end and correlator providing a much improved sensitivity .",
    "ngc  3359 and ngc  4565 were each observed for 12 hours providing a sensitivity of 0.85 mjy / beam for spatial and velocity resolutions of 30@xmath0 and 10 km s@xmath1 .",
    "ngc  6946 was observed for 15 @xmath2 12 hours and reaches a sensitivity of 0.5 mjy / beam for spatial and velocity resolutions of 60@xmath0 and 5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we will discuss each case individually below .",
    "ngc  3359 is a nearby barred spiral galaxy ( hubble type sb(rs)c ) which has been observed in h0.1emi by broeils ( 1992 ) as part of a study of the mass distribution of a sample of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "it has a total mass of @xmath3 m@xmath4 and an h0.1emi mass of @xmath5 m@xmath4 ( broeils & rhee , 1997 , adjusted for a hubble constant of 72 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "it has well developed spiral structure both in the optical and in h0.1emi .",
    "kamphuis & sancisi ( 1994 , see also sancisi 1999 ) pointed out the presence of an h0.1emi companion which appears distorted and may connect to the main h0.1emi disk of ngc  3359 .",
    "this observation already suggested the possibility of witnessing accretion of gas by a large galaxy .",
    "our new , more sensitive observations are shown in figure 1 and convincingly display an h0.1emi connection between the distorted h0.1emi companion and the main galaxy . the mass of the h0.1emi companion is @xmath6 m@xmath4 or 2.4% of the h0.1emi mass of ngc  3359 . also shown in figure 1 is a blow - up of the h0.1emi distribution of the companion which is clearly distorted and shows a tail pointing towards and connecting with the outer spiral structure of ngc  3359 . no optical counterpart has yet been identified .    the velocity structure of the h0.1emi companion and the connecting h0.1emi fits in very well with the regular velocity field of ngc  3359 .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 where we display the emission in the individual channels superposed on the total h0.1emi image of ngc  3359 .",
    "contours of different shades of grey ( low velocities are dark , high velocities are light ) denote the outer edge of the h0.1emi emission in each of the velocity channels and thus display the basic kinematics of the h0.1emi without any further analysis of individual velocity profiles .",
    "the regularity of the velocities suggests that the process has been going on slowly for at least one rotational period which is of the order of 1.7 gy .",
    "ngc  4565 is a large edge - on galaxy of hubble type sab which was first observed in h0.1emi by sancisi ( 1976 ) in an early search for galaxies with warped h0.1emi disks .",
    "rupen ( 1991 ) observed ngc  4565 with much higher resolution and presented a detailed study of the kinematics and the warp .",
    "ngc  4565 has a small optical companion 6@xmath7 to the north of the center of ngc  4565 , f378 - 0021557 , which has @xmath8 m@xmath4 of h0.1emi compared to an h0.1emi mass of @xmath9 m@xmath4 for ngc  4565 .",
    "another companion , ngc  4562 , somewhat larger in h0.1emi ( @xmath10 m@xmath4 ) and brighter optically can be found found 15@xmath7 to the south - west of the center of ngc  4565 .",
    "the h0.1emi distribution , superposed on the dss is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the asymmetric warp is clearly visible .",
    "the warp sets in at the edge of the optical disk and does exhibit a bit of apparent thickening of the h0.1emi disk visible to the north - west and south - east of the disk , a result from projection effects along the line of sight .",
    "inspection of individual channel maps brings to light that in addition to the warp the h0.1emi distribution shows additional , low surface brightness emission to the north of the center , in the direction of the faint companion f378 - 0021557 .",
    "this is best shown in figure 4 where we show the outer contours of the h0.1emi emission in individual velocity channels superposed on the total h0.1emi distribution of ngc  4565 . in this figure",
    "one clearly sees that there is an additional extraplanar h0.1emi component pointing into the direction of f378 - 0021557 , suggestive of a connection between the presence of f378 - 0021557 and disturbances in the h0.1emi disk of ngc  4565 . whether this is recently accreted material",
    "can not easily be verified , but it definitely shows that there is a component in the h0.1emi disk of ngc  4565 which can not be associated with the warp and is the kind of small ( in terms of h0.1emi mass ) asymmetry that could be the result of accretion .",
    "ngc  6946 is a bright , nearby spiral galaxy of hubble type sab(rs)cd which has been studied in h0.1emi numerous times ( rogstad et al .",
    "1973 , tacconi & young 1986 , kamphuis 1993 ) .",
    "it was in this galaxy that kamphuis and sancisi ( 1993 ) found the first evidence for an anomalous velocity h0.1emi component which they associated with outflow of gas from the disk into the halo as a result of stellar winds and supernova events .",
    "evidence for such a component is now evident in more galaxies as discussed by fraternali et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 , and also this volume ) .",
    "a much more detailed study of the anomalous h0.1emi and the structure in the h0.1emi disk is being carried out by boomsma et al .",
    "( this volume , see also fraternali et al .",
    "this volume ) on the basis of very sensitive observations with the wsrt .",
    "here we concentrate on a low resolution ( 60@xmath0 ) version of these data .",
    "figure 5 shows a total h0.1emi image of ngc  6946 down to column density levels of @xmath11 @xmath12 . to the west two small companion galaxies",
    "can be seen .",
    "the most intruiging feature is the faint whisp to the north - west of the main h0.1emi disk of ngc  6946 .",
    "this faint h0.1emi extension can only be brought out at this resolution and appears to form a faint h0.1emi filament which blends smoothly ( also kinematically ) with the h0.1emi disk of ngc  6946 at a position some 11@xmath7 ( or 19 kpc ) south of the tip of the filament .",
    "there is no detectable connection with the two companion galaxies farther to the west .",
    "the spatial and velocity structure of the object are so regular , yet only connected to the main h0.1emi disk at one side that we prefer an explanation in terms of a tidally stretched , infalling h0.1emi object .",
    "so yet another example of accretion of small amount of gas onto a large h0.1emi disk .",
    "similar examples , though much more massive in h0.1emi , are perhaps the filament discovered in ngc  2403 ( fraternali et al . 2002 , 2003 and",
    "also this volume ) , a long h0.1emi filament in m  33 ( van der hulst , unpublished ) and the extraplanar filaments in the northern part of the h0.1emi halo of ngc  891 ( fraternali et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "we have shown three cases with strong evidence for the accretion of small amounts of h0.1emi . these will not be unique .",
    "such faint features can only be seen in sensitive h0.1emi observations as the h0.1emi masses involved are rather modest .",
    "we therefore expect that with the increased sensitivity of modern synthesis radio telescopes , more examples will be discovered in the coming decade .",
    "there probably is a range of h0.1emi masses for these accretion events as is already apparent from the six cases mentioned here : ngc  891 , ngc  2403 , ngc  3359 , ngc  4565 , ngc  6946 and m  33 .",
    "the next question to ask is what the effect of accretion will be on the disk of the main galaxy .",
    "there may very well be a connection with the star formation activity in galaxies such as ngc  6946 and ngc  2403 and the evidence for gas infall .",
    "this then in turn can cause the observed phenomenon of gas outflows from the active disks as seen in these galaxies ( boomsma et al . and fraternali et al .",
    "this volume ) .",
    "it is quite clear that future sensitive and detailed studies of the h0.1emi in nearby galaxies will provide a more complete census of the phenomena discussed in this paper and enable us to address these issues further and obtain more definitive answers .",
