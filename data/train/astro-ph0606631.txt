    "with a cosmic abundance @xmath7 , deuterium is more common than all but a half - dozen heavy elements .",
    "the initial deuterium abundance was set by primordial nucleosynthesis ( e.g.  schramm & turner 1998 ) , roughly @xmath8 after the big bang , and has been reduced by stellar nuclear reactions over the subsequent 13.7 gyr . the primordial deuterium abundance revealed from intergalactic absorption components ( e.g.  kirkman et al.2003 , who obtained",
    "[ d/[h]=@xmath9 toward q1243 + 3047 ) is in good agreement with models for primordial nucleosynthesis , given the baryon densities derived independently from an analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g.  spergel et al .",
    "thus , the distribution of deuterium in the galaxy probes both stellar processing and the degree to which material is mixed efficiently within the interstellar medium . the abundance of interstellar deuterium has been measured primarily by ultraviolet absorption line observations of atomic deuterium within diffuse clouds ( reviewed by moos et al .",
    "recent measurements of the galactic deuterium abundance reveal significant variations ( over the range @xmath10 ) that are inconsistent with current predictions from galactic chemical evolution models ( e.g.  wood et al .",
    "2004 , friedman et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) ; understanding the nature of these inconsistencies is critical to our understanding of chemical evolution within the galaxy .",
    "while deuterium has been extensively studied in atomic clouds , the deuterium abundance in molecular clouds is less certain . in diffuse",
    "molecular clouds , interstellar hydrogen deuteride ( hd ) has been widely observed by means of ultraviolet spectroscopy  starting over 30 years ago with the _ copernicus _ satellite ( reviewed by spitzer & jenkins 1975 )  and is the most abundant deuterium - bearing molecule .",
    "however , deriving the deuterium abundance from the hd column in diffuse clouds is difficult for several reasons : the chemistry is complex , hd contains only a trace amount of d , and the hd abundance is sensitive to the density and uv field in the cloud ( lacour et al .",
    "2005 ; le  petit et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in dense molecular clouds ,",
    "by contrast , the observations are much fewer . prior to the results reported here ,",
    "detections of hydrogen deuteride emissions had been reported toward just one cloud : the orion molecular cloud ( wright et al .  1999 ; howat et al .  2002 ; bertoldi et al .",
    "1999 ; the latter s detection of hd from warm shocked gas having been anticipated theoretically by timmermann 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , hd r(0 ) line absorption has been detected toward two far - ir continuum sources : sgr b2 ( polehampton et al .",
    "2002 ) and w49 ( caux et al .",
    "hd is not easily detected by infrared emission - line spectroscopy ; its small dipole moment leads to relatively weak emission and its large rotational constant places its pure rotational transitions at infrared frequencies that are inaccessible from ground - based telescopes . on the other hand ,",
    "a large number of other deuterium - bearing molecules are readily detected with ground - based radio telescopes .",
    "many molecules , such as methanol , show high levels of deuterium fractionation , in which the deuterated / non - deuterated abundance ratio can exceed the cosmic deuterium abundance by more than four orders of magnitude ; several doubly- and even triply - deuterated species have been observed ( parise et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this paper",
    ", we report a detection of hd in shocked molecular gas within the supernova remnant ic443 , clump c , and tentative detections in three other sources  the herbig - haro objects hh54 and hh7 , and the star - forming region ggd37 ( cep a w )  all from observations with the infrared spectrometer ( irs ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. the observational results are discussed in  2 , below , and the implied gas density and hd abundance derived in  3 .",
    "the implications of the inferred hd abundance are discussed in  4 .",
    "two pure rotational lines fall within the 19.5  37.2  @xmath11 m wavelength range covered by the long - high module on the irs : the hd r(3 ) and r(4 ) transitions at 28.502 and 23.034 @xmath11 m , respectively .",
    "weak spectral features have been observed serendipitously at both wavelengths in several sources , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "these plotted spectra were obtained in spectral line mapping observations of ic443c conducted in go cycle 1  and of hh54 , hh7 and ggd37 carried out in the irac- and irs - gto programs  along with observations with the short - high module .",
    "in addition , ic443c , hh54 , and hh7 had been observed in the short - low module , to provide complete spectral coverage from 5.2  37 @xmath11 m so that the h@xmath1 s(0 ) ",
    "s(7 ) transitions  and the fine structure lines of [ feii ] , [ si ] , [ neii ] and [ siii ]  could all be mapped .",
    "these other observations , especially those of the h@xmath1 pure rotational transitions , tightly constrain the temperature and column density of the shocked gas , allowing a determination of the hd / h@xmath1 abundance ratio .",
    "table 1 summarizes the measured r(3 ) and r(4 ) line intensities . at each of six positions  1 each in ic443c , hh7 and ggd37 , and 3 in hh54",
    " we have obtained averages of all spectra observed within a circular region , the contributing spectra being weighted by a gaussian taper ( hpbw of 15@xmath12 ) from the center of each such region .",
    "the central positions are given in table 1 .",
    "full details of the observations toward hh7 and hh54 , as well as the data reduction methods we have developed , are given by neufeld et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    searching the nist database of atomic fine structure lines  along with the jpl molecular line list  for alternative identifications of the 28.502 and 23.034 @xmath11 m features , we found no plausible candidates besides hd .",
    "in particular , a large number of water rotational transitions lie in the wavelength region of interest , but the only such transitions within one spectral resolution element of 28.502 and 23.034 @xmath11 m are very - high - lying transitions that would be accompanied by other  much stronger  transitions that are absent in the observed spectra . as a check upon the reality of the observed spectral features",
    ", we have constructed maps of their distribution .",
    "figure 2 shows the map obtained toward ic443c , which exhibits the highest column density of warm h@xmath1 and the strongest 28.502 and 23.034  @xmath11 m features .",
    "here , we compare maps of the 28.502 and 23.034  @xmath11",
    "m features with those of the h@xmath1 s(2 ) , which has an upper state energy @xmath13 = 1682 k , similar to those of hd r(3 ) and r(4 ) ( @xmath14 1271 k and 1895 k ) .",
    "a map of the h@xmath1 s(3 )  for which @xmath14 2504 k  is also shown .",
    "the agreement of the observed morphology in the four lines lends strong support to the identification of hd and eliminates the possibility that the 28.502 and 23.034  @xmath11 m features are ( previously unidentified ) instrumental artifacts . in the other sources ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is insufficient to allow the distribution of the 28.502 and 23.034  @xmath11",
    "m features to be mapped reliably ; accordingly , we conservatively describe the detection of hd in those sources as tentative .",
    "using _ spitzer_/irs observations of the h@xmath1 s(0 ) through s(7 ) transitions towards these sources , we can constrain the column density and temperature of the warm , shocked molecular hydrogen very well , and can thereby estimate the hd / h@xmath1 abundance ratio . as described by neufeld et al .  ( 2006 ) , we have fitted the h@xmath1 rotational diagrams with a model which invokes two components : a warm component at temperature @xmath15  k and a hot component at temperature @xmath16  k. the temperatures and column densities of the warm and hot gas components are given in table 1 .",
    "our analysis neglects the effects of subthermal excitation for the h@xmath1 transitions that we have observed ; while possibly important for the higher-@xmath17 transitions of h@xmath1 ( i.e.  s(6 ) and s(7 ) ) , such effects are negligible for the lower-@xmath17 h@xmath1 transitions that probe the most of the gas capable of producing hd r(3 ) and r(4 ) emissions .    unlike the lower-@xmath17 states of h@xmath1 ,",
    "however , the hd level populations for j = 5 and 4 are expected to show departures from lte , due to the presence of a small but non - zero dipole moment .",
    "we used a statistical equilibrium calculation to compute the hd level populations , adopting the collisional rate coefficients of flower & roueff ( 1999 ) for excitation by h@xmath1 .",
    "we thereby determined the resultant hd emission , given the two - component model parameters derived from our fit to the h@xmath1 rotational diagram , and assuming ( 1 ) that hd is at the same kinetic temperature as h@xmath1 ; ( 2 ) that the hd abundance relative to h@xmath1 , @xmath18 , is the same in both the warm ( @xmath19 400 k ) and hot ( @xmath19 1000k ) gas components ; and ( 3 ) that the warm and hot components have the same gas pressure , @xmath20 .",
    "typically , the contributions made by the hot and warm components to the observed hd emissions were roughly equal in our excitation model .",
    "the critical densities for r(3 ) and r(4 )  i.e. the densities at which the departure coefficients for j = 5 and j = 4 equal one - half  correspond to pressures @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , so the r(4)/r(3 ) ratio is a useful density indicator for pressures in the @xmath23 range .",
    "the r(4)/r(3 ) intensity ratios predicted for ic443c are 0.32 , 0.40 , 0.50 , 0.61 , 0.72 and 0.82 respectively for log@xmath24 t/\\rm cm^{-3}\\,k)$ ] = 7.0 , 7.2 , 7.4 , 7.6 , 7.8 , and 8.0 .",
    "we varied the gas pressure , @xmath25 , and the hd abundance relative to h@xmath1 , @xmath18 , to obtain the best fit to the observed hd r(3 ) and r(4 ) line strengths . because the hd transitions are optically - thin , the hd line intensities scale linearly with @xmath18 . while our estimates of the gas pressure or density scale in inverse proportion to the assumed collisional rate coefficients , the derived hd abundance would be entirely unaffected by a ( uniform ) change in the adopted rate coefficients .",
    "table 1 lists the best - fit gas pressure and hd abundance relative to h@xmath1 derived for each region .    in figure 3",
    ", we show the confidence regions for the gas pressure and hd / h@xmath1 ratio : 68.3 , and 95.4 @xmath5 confidence regions are shown for each of the five sources we observed , based upon the statistical errors on the hd r(3 ) and r(4 ) line fluxes and assuming the h@xmath1 column densities and temperatures ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) listed in table 1 .",
    "the confidence limits presented here are based solely upon the statistical errors in the measured line fluxes and do not include systematic uncertainties in the hd excitation model .",
    "such uncertainties are hard to estimate quantitatively , and include possible errors in the collisional rate coefficients and in the assumption that the warm and hot gas components share a common pressure",
    ". the derived hd abundances ( although not the gas pressures ) appear to be relatively insensitive to the assumed collisional rate coefficients .",
    "if the hd  he ( roueff & zeippen 2000 ) or hd  h rate coefficients ( flower & roueff 1999 ) are adopted in place of the hd  h@xmath1 rate coefficients , the best - fit hd abundances change by less than @xmath30 . on the other hand , if it is assumed that the warm and hot gas components share a common density rather than being in pressure equilibrium , the best - fit hd abundances increase by up to @xmath31 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is significantly better toward ic443c , hh54fs , and hh7 , the only cases for which r(4 ) is detected at the @xmath32 level . the best fit gas pressures in these sources , found to lie in the range @xmath33 , correspond to gas densities in the range @xmath34 to @xmath35 for the warm gas component .",
    "these values are in reasonable agreement with those derived previously for these regions ( see discussion of hh7 and hh54 by neufeld et al .  2006 ; and of ic443 by snell et al .  2005 . ) the hd r(4)/r(3 ) intensity ratio promises to be a valuable probe of the gas pressure in regions where it can be observed .",
    "our analysis yields best estimates of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ( 68@xmath5 confidence intervals ) respectively for the hd abundance relative to h@xmath1 in ic443c , hh54fs , and hh7 , but all three estimates are consistent ( within the 68@xmath5 confidence intervals ) with @xmath36 . if hd accounts for all the deuterium in the gas phase ( timmermann 1996 ) , and applied a correction in deriving the gas - phase elemental abundance of hd . in the shocked regions that we have observed , however , the inferred shock velocities ( @xmath37 ; neufeld et al .",
    "2006 ) are significantly smaller than those for the orion shock ; thus the resultant atomic h abundance is expected to be much smaller and the extent of hd destruction negligible . ]",

    "it is also remarkably consistent with the deuterium abundances observed recently in atomic clouds along long sight - lines within the galactic disk toward stars further than 500  pc from the sun and with atomic h column densities in excess of 10@xmath38 , which yield @xmath6_{\\rm gas } = ( 8.5 \\pm 1.0 ) \\times 10^{-6}$ ] ( hoopes et al .  2003 ; wood et al .",

    "the explanation of these variations has been a subject of considerable debate ( friedman et al .",
    "hbrard and moos ( 2003 ) have argued that the lower values inferred for high-@xmath39 sight - lines to distant stars represent the typical galactic elemental abundance for deuterium , requiring a substantial degree of destruction via astration ( i.e.  in stars ) , while draine ( 2004 ) has argued for the importance of depletion in reducing the gas - phase deuterium abundance , a possibility originally raised by jura ( 1982 ) . in this picture ,",
