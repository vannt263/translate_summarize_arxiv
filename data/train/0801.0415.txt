    "it was realized relatively early that the transverse momenta of initial ( before a hard process ) partons may play an important role in order to understand the distributions of produced direct photons , especially at small transverse momenta ( see e.g. ref .",

    "transverse momenta is via gaussian smearing @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological approach is not completely justified theoretically .",
    "the unintegrated parton distribution functions ( updfs ) are the basic quantities that take into account explicitly the parton transverse momenta .",
    "the updfs have been studied recently in the context of different high - energy processes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these works are concentrated mainly on gluon degrees of fredom which play the dominant role in many processes at very high energies . at",
    "somewhat lower energies also quark and antiquark degrees of freedom become equally important .",
    "recently the approach which dynamically includes transverse momenta of not only gluons but also of quarks and antiquarks was applied to direct - photon production @xcite .    up to now",
    "there is no complete agreement how to include evolution effects into the building blocks of the high - energy processes  the unintegrated parton distributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have discussed in detail a few approaches how to include transverse momenta of the incoming partons in order to calculate distributions of direct photons . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have discussed in addition photon - jet correlations .",
    "there is recently at rhic interest in studying hadron - hadron correlations .",
    "the hadron - hadron correlations involve both jet - jet correlations as well as complicated jet structure .",

    ", such correlations should be easier for theoretical description as here only one jet enters , at least in leading order pqcd .",

    "in the @xmath0-factorization approach the cross section for the production of a pair of photon and parton @xmath4 can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are so - called transverse masses defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass of a parton . in the following we shall assume that all partons are massless .",

    "in our analysis we use updfs from the literature .",
    "there are only two complete sets of updfs in the literature which include not only gluon distributions but also distributions of quarks and antiquarks : ( a ) kwieciski @xcite , ( b ) kimber - martin - ryskin @xcite .",
    "for comparison we shall include also unintegrated parton distributions obtained from collinear ones by the gaussian smearing procedure .",

    "will allow to quantify the effect of updf evolution as contained in the kwieciski evolution equations . what is the hard scale for our process ? in our case the best candidate for the scale is the photon and/or jet transverse momentum .",
    "since we are interested in rather small transverse momenta the evolution length is not too large and the deviations from initial @xmath0-distributions ( assumed here to be gaussian ) should not be too big .    at high energies",
    "one enters into a small - x region , i.e. the region of a specific dynamics of the qcd emissions . in this region only unintegrated distributions of gluons exist in the literature . in our case",

    "this ridge corresponds to a soft singularity when the unobserved parton has very small transverse momentum @xmath28 . at the same time this corresponds to the azimuthal angle between the photon and the jet being @xmath29 .",

    "the difference becomes less and less pronounced when the scale increases . at @xmath19 = 100 gev@xmath20",
