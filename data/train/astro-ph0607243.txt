    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence is present in many astronomical settings , such as the solar wind , the interstellar medium , molecular clouds , accretion disks , and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",

    "the simplest of cases concerns the small  scale dynamics of the excitations of an incompressible fluid with a mean magnetic field .",
    "the turbulent cascade of energy to small scales is the result of non linear interactions between alfvn waves traveling in opposite directions along the local , mean magnetic field @xcite .",
    "whereas this broad picture of iroshnikov and kraichnan still endures , our appreciation of mhd turbulence has undergone significant revisions due , mainly , to the recognition of the importance of anisotropy and the consequent strengthening of non linear interactions .",
    "the inertial ",
    "range , which includes length scales between the stirring and dissipation scales , is best understood in those cases in which the oppositely directed waves are excited with equal power : these _ balanced _ cascades can be _ weak _ @xcite , as well as _ strong",
    "_ imbalanced _ cascades are understood only in the case when the turbulence is _ weak _ @xcite . in this letter",
    "we consider the general case of imbalanced cascades .",

    "situ measurements by spacecraft yield spectra for velocity and magnetic field fluctuations over many decades of lengthscale ( e.g. , horbury 1999 ) . on the largest scales ,",
    "the spectrum is flat , presumably reflecting the spectrum with which fluctuations are injected into the solar wind by shocks or dynamical instabilities . on smaller scales , the spectrum is kolmogorov , and fluctuations are thought to be undergoing an active turbulent cascade . on these scales , the amplitudes of the two elsasser fields",
    "are not equal : waves travelling away from the sun have higher amplitudes than those travelling towards it .",
    "because of this imbalance , the theory of mhd turbulence has been inadequate for application to the solar wind . our solution for the strong imbalanced cascade",
    "removes this inadequacy .    in  [ sec : balanced ] , we summarize the properties of mhd cascades that were previously understood .",

    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the alfvn speed , and @xmath8 is the total pressure , determined by requiring @xmath9 . we have neglected viscous and resistive dissipative terms , which are important on small scales ; we have also neglected forcing terms , which are important on large scales .",
    "when either @xmath10 or @xmath5 is initially zero everywhere , the nonlinear term vanishes for all time .",
    "then , either @xmath11 , or @xmath12 , is a nonlinear solution of arbitrary form , that propagates in the @xmath13 or @xmath14 direction with speed @xmath15 .",
    "kraichnan recognised that the existence of these nonlinear solutions implies that mhd turbulence can be described as interactions between oppositely directed wavepackets .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : mhd ] ) conserve the elsasser energies , @xmath16 , hence collisions between wavepackets do not lead to exchanges between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but only to a redistribution of the energies over different length scales .",

    "we note that @xmath21 is scale - dependent , and is typically much larger than @xmath20 .",
    "we define the strength of a wavepacket as the ratio of the straining rate that it imposes on oppositely directed waves , @xmath22 , to its linear wave frequency : @xmath23 if a wavepacket of @xmath24ve waves has @xmath25 , then @xmath26ve waves with scale @xmath20 that encounter it are cascaded in the time that they cross it , assuming that the backreaction of the @xmath26ve waves on the @xmath24ve ones is negligible.we wish to understand how @xmath27 influence the inertial  range scalings of physical quantities .",

    "amplitude across a transverse scale @xmath20 is @xmath32 .",
    "frequency resonance conditions prevent a parallel cascade , so the parallel scale is independent of @xmath20 ; its value is set by conditions at the stirring scale .",
    "perturbation theory is valid when @xmath33 , and can be used to derive kinetic equations , describing the inertial  range .",
    "however , the cascade strengthens on small scales , because @xmath34 increases as @xmath20 decreases ; this limits the validity of perturbation theory , and the inertial range of weak turbulence .",
    "_ balanced strong turbulence _ , @xmath35 : perturbation theory is inapplicable . according to the phenomenological theory of @xcite ,",
    "the strength of the interactions remains of order unity : @xmath36 ( `` critical balance '' ) .",

    "turbulence that is excited with @xmath39 , weakens to @xmath36 in less than the alfvn crossing time",
    "_ imbalanced weak turbulence _ , @xmath40 : in common with the balanced case , the process can be described in detail , using the weak turbulence theory of resonant 3wave interactions @xcite .",
    "as before , the product @xmath41 , and frequency resonance conditions forbid a parallel cascade , so the two parallel scales @xmath21 are scale - independent .",
    "however , in contrast to the balanced case , ( i ) kinetic equations are required to relate the spectral indices of the oppositely directed waves to the ratio of their fluxes ; ( ii ) the ratio of @xmath42 to @xmath43 in the inertial range depends on the ratio of @xmath20 to the dissipation scale , @xmath44 , since the two amplitudes are forced to equal one another at @xmath44 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , when the dissipation scale is large enough ( while still remaining smaller than the stirring scale ) , imbalanced turbulence can be weak throughout the inertial  range .",
    "however , both @xmath45 and @xmath46 increase with decreasing @xmath20 , thereby limiting the inertial range .",
    "therefore , in the physically important limit of very small dissipation , it is inevitable that at least one of the @xmath24ve or @xmath26ve cascades becomes strong .",
    "in the present section , the heart of this paper , we derive the spectrum of imbalanced strong turbulence .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 .. ]    let @xmath48 .",
    "otherwise , the turbulence would be weak .",
    "the @xmath24ve waves impose a strain on @xmath26ve ones , with straining rate @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath50 , this strain is nearly constant over the cascade time , @xmath51 , of the @xmath26ve waves .",
    "thus @xmath52 and the energy flux in the @xmath26ve cascade is @xmath53 waves of @xmath54 travel a parallel distance @xmath55 before cascading to smaller @xmath20 . it _ follows _ that a wavepacket with given transverse size @xmath20 has parallel size @xmath56 since this relation mixes @xmath57 and @xmath58 , it does not amount to critical balance for either the @xmath24ve or @xmath26ve waves .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lambdaminus ] ) , together with our starting point @xmath48 , imply that @xmath59 .",
    "but , since @xmath26ve waves backreact on the @xmath24ve ones , they impose uncorrelated strains on parts of a @xmath24 wavepacket separated in @xmath60 by @xmath61 . thus they imprint their parallel scales on the @xmath24ve waves , and @xmath62 henceforth we denote the common parallel scales by @xmath63 . this _ discovery _ that the parallel scales are similar in an imbalanced cascade is a _ nontrivial _ result",
    ". equations ( [ eq : lambdaminus ] ) and ( [ eq : equal ] ) yield @xmath64 _ proving _ that the cascade of @xmath26ve waves is critically balanced .",
    "it remains to calculate the @xmath24ve waves cascade time .",
    "all of the following material up to equation ( [ eq : fluxplus2 ] ) , as well as the material in the appendix , is devoted to _ deriving _ the result : @xmath65 .",
    "this result is remarkable .",
    "it shows that the straining rate imposed by the @xmath26ve waves on @xmath24ve ones , @xmath66 , is imposed coherently over a time @xmath67 .",
    "yet the waveperiod of @xmath26ve waves is much shorter than this , by the factor @xmath68 since @xmath69 , one might be tempted to conclude , erroneously , that @xmath24ve waves undergo a weak cascade , i.e. , that @xmath26ve waves impose on them small , short uncorrelated strains of amplitude @xmath70 over time intervals @xmath71 resulting in @xmath72 . instead , the correct conclusion is that a coherent strain is imposed over time interval @xmath67 .",
    "how can the coherence time exceed @xmath73 ?",
    "the key point is that the straining of the @xmath24ve waves is due to the @xmath74 field as seen from the @xmath24ve waves rest frame ( which has @xmath75 ) . in this frame ,",
    "the mhd equations  ( [ eq : mhd ] ) transform to @xmath76 to appreciate that the correlation time of @xmath5 in the primed frame can exceed @xmath73 , consider the limiting case in which @xmath5 is so small that backreaction onto the @xmath24ve waves can be neglected .",
    "then @xmath10 is independent of @xmath77 , and is a function only of @xmath78 , so @xmath5 satisfies a linear ( integro  differential ) equation , whose coefficients are independent of @xmath77 . if @xmath26ve waves are injected on a lengthscale much larger than the scale of interest , with a long coherence time @xmath79 , then as they cascade down to smaller scales their coherence time remains fixed , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is defined as the correlation time of the @xmath26ve waves in the frame of the @xmath24ve waves . in the limiting case that @xmath82 is held fixed at the injection scale ( @xmath83 ) , then on smaller scales @xmath5 is independent of @xmath77 ( @xmath84 ) , even though it is undergoing an active cascade to small scales .    to estimate @xmath81 when @xmath74 is not infinitesimally small , it is necessary to account for backreaction : @xmath26ve waves alter @xmath24ve waves , which react back on the @xmath26ve ones . as @xmath26ve waves cross a plane at fixed @xmath85 , the @xmath24ve waves at that plane are changing on their cascade time scale @xmath86 .",
    "hence , over times separated by @xmath86 , the @xmath26ve waves crossing @xmath87 are cascaded by entirely different @xmath24ve waves .",
    "this implies that @xmath88 .",
    "is accumulated on scales comparable to @xmath20 .",
    "we justify this assumption quantitatively in the appendix . ]",
    "because the @xmath24ve waves are strained at rate @xmath66 , it follows that @xmath65 . thus @xmath89 invoking kolmogorov s hypothesis of the scale ( i.e. @xmath20 ) independence of the energy fluxes given by equations  ( [ eq : fluxminus ] ) and ( [ eq : fluxplus2 ] ) , we obtain the inertial ",
    "range scalings , @xmath90    the @xmath24ve wave cascade shares some characteristics with both weak and strong balanced mhd cascades .",
    "in the weak cascades , the cascade time is longer than the waveperiod , and a wave experiences multiple , randomly - phased perturbations during its cascade time . in the strong cascades ,",
    "the cascade time is comparable to ( or shorter than ) the waveperiod , and a wave suffers a coherent strain as it cascades .",
    "furthermore , weak turbulence submits to perturbation theory but strong turbulence does not . in the @xmath24ve wave cascade :    * the period of a @xmath24ve wave is shorter than its cascade time .",
    "* a @xmath24ve wave is coherently strained as it cascades.ve waves , @xmath81 , is comparable to the cascade time , @xmath86 , of the @xmath24ve waves . ] * the @xmath24ve wave cascade is non - perturbative .",
    "we contend that the @xmath24ve wave cascade is strong because the second and third items have dynamical significance whereas the first does not .",
    "the dimensionless parameter that indicates whether the @xmath24ve waves are strongly cascaded is @xmath91 and not @xmath70 .",
    "strong cascades correspond to @xmath92 , and weak ones to @xmath93 .",
    "for the @xmath26ve wave cascade , @xmath94 , since the correlation time of @xmath24ve waves in the frame of the @xmath26ve ones is @xmath73 .",
    "we call the criterion @xmath95 `` modified critical balance , '' to distinguish it from critical balance ( which would incorrectly imply @xmath96 ) .",
    "we have deduced the behavior of imbalanced strong mhd turbulence .",
    "its salient properties are :    \\1 .",
    "the @xmath24ve and @xmath26ve waves carry unequal energy fluxes , @xmath97 , while they both undergo _ strong _ cascades .    \\2 . in the inertial ",
    "range , the r.m.s .",
    "elsasser amplitudes are proportional to the one  third power of the transverse scale : @xmath98 .",
    "this is similar to the balanced , strong cascade .",
    "moreover , their ratio , @xmath99 is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "the parallel scales of the @xmath24ve and @xmath26ve waves are equal .",
    "the common parallel scale of eddies of transverse scale @xmath20 , is @xmath100 , similar to the balanced , strong cascade .",
    "the cascade times of the ( larger amplitude ) @xmath24ve waves are longer than their waveperiods by the constant factor @xmath101 , independent of scale : unlike the imbalanced , weak cascade , there is no tendency for the cascade to strengthen at small @xmath20 . when @xmath102 , the the turbulence corresponds to the balanced strong cascade of @xcite",
    "let @xmath103 denote the time scale over which @xmath42 varies at fixed @xmath85 .",
    "below we prove that ( i ) the correlation time of the @xmath26ve waves , at fixed @xmath104 , is @xmath105 ; ( ii ) @xmath106 .    during the time interval @xmath107",
    ", @xmath26ve waves cascade from transverse scales @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "we approximate this cascade as taking place in discrete steps of duration @xmath110 in each of which @xmath20 decreases by a constant factor of order unity .",
    "thus @xmath108 is related to @xmath109 by @xmath111 if @xmath112 increases with @xmath20 , equation  ( [ eq : lambdaprime ] ) implies that @xmath113 most of the cascade time is spent near scales @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath24ve waves encountered by @xmath26ve waves , at the same @xmath85 and @xmath20 , but separated in time by @xmath115 , differ by @xmath116 . to denote differences accrued over the time interval @xmath115 .",
    "] thus over each step of the cascade from @xmath117 to @xmath109 , @xmath118 where we have used , @xmath119",
    ". then the mean square fractional variation of @xmath120 accumulated during the the entire cascade amounts to @xmath121 provided @xmath122 increases with @xmath20 , @xmath123 although most of the cascade time is spent near @xmath108 ( see equation  [ eq : lambdastar ] ) , the accumulated change in @xmath120 comes from scales near @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath120 varies by order unity , at fixed @xmath85 , during the time interval , @xmath124 , the correlation time of the @xmath26ve waves is , @xmath125 which proves item ( i ) . to prove ( ii ) ,",
