    "the description of high energy processes at hadron colliders together with the study of the environment these events are emerging into , will rely heavily on the predictive power of the theory of quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is well known that qcd studies enable a better understanding of the color flow dynamics , which in turn facilitates improved predictions on observables such as @xmath1 distributions and production rates .",
    "also , qcd studies have a direct impact on theoretical predictions for signals and their backgrounds , which are a key element in the quest for _ precision _ physics at the highest energies .",
    "a plethora of data on multi - particle final states will soon become available from high - energy collider runs and the comparisons of jet observables with theoretical predictions will be vital .",
    "in fact , missing higher order qcd theoretical predictions for such observables may be large and important . therefore a systematic approach to perform these complex calculations , which usually involve the analysis of multi - leg and/or multi - loop amplitudes , becomes imperative . in recent years , new techniques and integral manipulation methods",
    "have been designed to achieve outstanding analytical results in this area .",
    "it is the purpose of this talk to review briefly the latest results on two - loop qcd corrections for massless @xmath2 parton scattering processes and some of the techniques used .",
    "this is not an exhaustive review , so more details can be found in the references provided and the ones therein .",
    "there are many important reasons why one might consider a next - to - next to leading order ( nnlo ) calculation@xcite and to mention a few ,    reduced scale dependence : :    the theoretical prediction for any observable @xmath3    should be independent of the renormalisation scale @xmath4 .",
    "but , if we perform a fixed order calculation a scale dependence is    introduced .",
    "the change due to the variation of renormalisation scale    is formally one order higher than the one at which the theoretical    prediction is given . often , when giving a nlo result , a variation of    @xmath4 around some hard scale is used as a tool to give the    uncertainty in uncalculated higher orders but , this is an _ estimate _    of their size .",
    "the theoretical prediction can be improved with a    complete nnlo result .",
    "improved jet description : :    if we consider higher order corrections we automatically improve the    matching between theoretically and experimentally defined jets . at    leading order we are modeling jets with single parton emission , but at    higher orders the phase space available is extended so that at nnlo up    to three partons can combine to form a jet .",
    "corrections beyond lo    involve a better description of soft gluon radiation within the jet    and this may provide a more accurate picture of its shape and    structure .",
    "reduced power corrections : :    when comparisons of nlo predictions with experimental data are made ,    the need for power corrections ( terms of    @xmath5 ) arises . the structure of these    corrections can be motivated theoretically but they are always fitted    to experiment .",
    "one might expect that higher order corrections may play    a role in reducing the size of these power corrections .",
    "the description of hard scattering processes at future hadron colliders requires the study of the factorized structure of a cross section for processes with quarks and gluons in the initial state . up to power corrections",
    ", the inclusive factorized cross section can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the momenta of the partons that initiate the hard scattering and @xmath8 are the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "the non - perturbative effects are comprised in these distribution functions ( and into fragmentation functions , in the exclusive case ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the hard scattering partonic cross section which describes the interaction of partons @xmath10 that arose from hadrons @xmath11 and can be calculated perturbatively , so that at nnlo for 2-particle production it can be written as @xmath12_4 ~d\\phi_4   + \\int     \\biggl [ { \\braket{\\cm^{(0)}}{\\cm^{(1 ) } } } + { \\braket{\\cm^{(1)}}{\\cm^{(0 ) } } }     \\biggr]_3 ~d\\phi_3 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "after renormalisation , each of the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hsmat ] ) is ultra - violet ( uv ) finite but infra - red ( ir ) divergent which manifests itself as poles in @xmath17 ( we adopt @xmath18 as a dimensional regulator ) .",
    "the integration over phase space and the cancellation of poles requires the study of the kinematical regions where the additional radiated particles become unresolved .",
    "finally , pdf s and their evolution are needed at an accuracy that matches that of the matrix element calculation and for nnlo some great developments have already taken place@xcite .",
    "the number of diagrams involved in the complete two - loop and one - loop matrix elements needed for the nnlo contribution to inclusive jet cross sections and photo - production at hadron colliders , are shown in table  [ tab : numofdiags ] @xcite .",

    ", the massless propagators are denoted by @xmath38 where @xmath39 can be any of the loop or external momenta .",
    "there are other terms that would typically look like the one shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalarint ] ) , except now the function @xmath40 is a tensor that can depend on the loop - momenta of the system and/or other tensors ( such as the metric tensor @xmath41 ) .",
    "furthermore , the denominator of an integral provides the momentum flow in the graph and gives a complete description of its skeleton or topology which can be _ planar _ or _ non - planar_. within these two categories we will identify sub - topologies or _",
    "pinchings _ , depending on whether or not a particular subset of propagators is absent .",
    "as technical aids , we use a couple of auxiliary general diagrams shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : auxdiag ] , where each of the propagators is labeled by an integer and carries a specific momentum that fulfills conservation of momenta throughout .",
    "this auxiliary representation allows us to manipulate hundreds of integrals with the minimum amount of information and without compromising the accuracy of the integral description .",
    "so to refer to a general @xmath42-dimensional integral with 10 propagators raised to arbitrary powers , we use @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "any planar or non - planar topology is represented by eliminating , increasing or decreasing the values of @xmath44 .",
    "it turns out that the two - loop qcd matrix - element calculation for @xmath2 scattering processes with massless external states , requires the _ explicit _ analytic evaluation of the 10 _ master _ integrals ( mi ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : master ] .",
    "any other integral that contains more powers in the propagators or higher dimensions can be written as a linear combination of the mi and below we will explore briefly how this can be done . first though , we will review the methods that are used to evaluate these mi explicitly .",
    "the strategically important analytic expressions for all mi have been provided in refs.@xcite as series in @xmath45 .",
    "usually , feynman or schwinger parameterizations ( see for example @xcite ) are used , whereby the propagators of the loop integrand are expressed in terms of integrations for real parameters over a particular range . in both of these approaches ,",
    "the loop momenta integration can be done easily and the remaining integrations over the parameters are doable for reasonably sized topologies . sometimes , using these parametric representations does not leave an integral that can be solved easily , even more so when the number of loops , external legs and kinematical scales increase .",
    "different techniques arose due to this situation , among others    * the mellin - barnes method is based on the representation for a sum to some power , as a contour integral over a complex variable and the integration is then performed on straight contour lines parallel to the imaginary axis . after closing a contour ,",
    "the result is the sum of all enclosed residues that may be expressed as a hypergeometric series .",
    "this has been used to obtain vital results for the two - loop boxes@xcite . *",
    "the negative dimensions technique consists of rewriting the integral over the parameters by introducing new ones through a multinomial expansion .",
    "many conditions have to be satisfied among the parameters , which leads to the restriction : @xmath42 must be a negative integer . some results for mi",
    "have been obtained using this method@xcite .",
    "* numerical strategies are used , where any loop integral is stripped analytically of its ir singularities so that the finite integrals can be performed numerically .",
    "these methods can also be used to tackle the phase space integrations in the calculation of observables@xcite . * the analytic evaluation of mi",
    "can also be carried out without explicit integration over loop momenta by deriving differential equations for mi in internal propagator masses or in external momenta .",
    "the equations can be solved with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "this approach has been widely used to evaluate mi , as was done recently for @xmath46@xcite .",
    "this approach produces an environment in which complex topologies with high powers on the propagators can be reduced down to integrals that can be solved with the methods described in the previous section .",
    "this reduction can be achieved using systems of equations that stem from integration by parts identities ( ibp)@xcite and exploiting the lorentz invariance@xcite of feynman integrals .",
    "let us review briefly how these identities are generated and help reduce the complexity of an integral .",
    "consider a general two - loop integral @xmath47 & = &   \\int   \\frac{d^dk}{i\\pi^{\\frac{d}{2 } } } \\int \\frac{d^d\\ell}{i\\pi^{\\frac{d}{2 } } } \\frac{1}{a_1^{\\nu_1 } \\cdots a_{n}^{\\nu_{n } } } , \\label{eq : loopint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the idea behind ibp is to generate relations between loop integrals through a total derivative with vanishing surface terms , expressed as the following identity @xmath48   & \\equiv & 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are the loop - momenta and @xmath50 can be any internal or external momenta involved in the loop integration . executing the derivative on all possible choices for",
    "@xmath51 will generate a set of relations loops and @xmath52 independent external momenta , we can generate @xmath53 identities . ] between integrals with dot products in the numerator .",
    "these dot products can be rewritten in terms of linear combinations of propagators , by means of relations such as @xmath54 with this simple step we can rewrite all the contents of the numerator in terms of propagators that may or may not be part of the denominator .",
    "we then say that the numerator is _ reducible _ if we can cancel it through and _",
    "irreducible _ otherwise . in most cases , we can exchange the problem of calculating the original integral , for the problem of calculating a set of simpler integrals .",
    "we can imagine studying all the ibp identities for the topologies involved in a particular matrix - element calculation and applying the reduction procedure iteratively .",
    "then we can assemble an algorithm that takes any integral and expresses it in terms of a few mi .",
    "this is precisely what we will review next .",
    "the ideas exposed above and extensions to them have been used in the past few years to tackle two - loop calculations . the way these calculations",
    "are put together varies , for example the chart in fig .",
    "[ fig : matelechart ] shows some basic steps we followed to evaluate the two - loop qcd matrix - elements for @xmath2 scattering .",
    "steps 1 through 3 are mainly related to the automatic generation of diagrams using qgraf@xcite and the tensor algebra manipulation using form@xcite . by step 4",
    ", we have the matrix element written as a linear combination of many different scalar and tensor two - loop integrals . these integrals can be rewritten in terms of mi ( step 6 ) , using a reduction system that was generated using maple ( step 5 ) .",
    "the final step is the input of @xmath17-expansions for each mi , so that we get @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the functions @xmath57 depend on the color factors @xmath58 and logarithms of ratios of the kinematic variables .",
    "the finite piece @xmath59 can contain up to 6 polylogarithms ( @xmath60 with @xmath61 ) of ratios in the kinematical variables , and the riemann zeta function @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 .",
    "several checks have served to verify the results obtained with this approach such as comparisons with qed processes@xcite and also the study of the analytic structure of qcd amplitudes in the limit of forward and backward scattering together with the confirmation of the two - loop gluon regge trajectory@xcite .",
    "the fact that the singular analytical structure in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polesme ] ) can be obtained independently , is also a powerful check on the calculation@xcite .",
    "catani@xcite proposed the structure of the @xmath64 poles together with the color uncorrelated structure of the @xmath65 pole .",
    "for a while , the origins of this proposal did not exist .",
    "however , in the work with sterman@xcite , we describe how the factorization properties of loop amplitudes lead to the exponentiation of double and single poles at each order in perturbation theory .",
    "the poles can then be assembled in terms of universal functions associated with the external partons .",
    "this formalism provides a way to generate the complete pole structure for multi - loop amplitudes at two loops and beyond .",
    "as reviewed , the past few years have seen a breakthrough in multi - loop integration technology and outstanding progress in the calculation of two - loop matrix elements in qcd .",
    "much work remains to be done to have nnlo monte carlo numerical estimates but , looking back at the results we now have , it seems they will be available soon for the first basic scattering processes .",
    "this will enable an improved description of high - energy qcd phenomena .",
