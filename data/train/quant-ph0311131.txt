    "in the paper that marked the beginning of information theory @xcite , c. e. shannon introduced the notion of a ( classical ) channel @xmath1 , a stochastic map modeling the effect of noise experienced by a classical message on its way from sender to remote receiver . there he defined and computed the key property of the channel @xmath1 : its _ capacity _ @xmath2 to convey classical information , expressed in bits per channel use .",
    "many decades later , in the context of quantum information theory , the notion of a _ quantum channel _ @xmath3 , a cptp ( completely positive trace preserving ) map , was introduced as the most general bipartite dynamic resource consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "there are now two basic capacities one may define for @xmath3 : classical @xmath4 and quantum @xmath5 .",
    "intuitively , these correspond to the maximum number of bits ( respectively qubits ) per use of @xmath3 that can be faithfully transmitted over the channel .",
    "the classical capacity theorem was independently proved by holevo @xcite , and schumacher and westmoreland @xcite .",
    "the quantum capacity theorem was originally stated by lloyd @xcite , although it was only recently generally realized that his proof could be made rigorous @xcite .",
    "it has also been proved by shor @xcite and subsequently , via the private classical capacity , by devetak @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we unify the two capacities by investigating the capacity of @xmath3 for _ simultaneously _ transmitting classical and quantum information , given in the form of a trade - off curve .",

    "our theorem is , alas , difficult to use in practice due to the @xmath95 limit .",
    "two simple examples in which this limit is not required are the noiseless qubit channel and the erasure channel , for which both @xmath4 and @xmath5 were previously known @xcite . in both cases",
    "the boring time - sharing strategy turns out to be optimal .",
    "this is particularly trivial to see for the noiseless channel : since @xmath96 , the inner and outer bound coincide .",

    "for the depolarizing channel , another popular example , the @xmath95 limit is known to be needed when the depolarizing parameter is close to @xmath100 , the value making @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "one can , however , make an interesting observation about the behavior of the trade - off curve near @xmath102 .",
    "although the channel itself is invariant under unitary transformations , the @xmath22 that maximizes the coherent information @xmath103 breaks this symmetry ; indeed there is a whole family of density operators attaining @xmath5 .",
    "one can thus construct an ensemble with @xmath102 and @xmath104 , so the trade - off curve is parallel to the @xmath105 axis in a finite region around @xmath106 .",

    "the result for the @xmath111 region parallels that from theorem 1 , replacing ( [ regija ] ) by @xmath112 the two expressions on the right hand side have the same sum as in equation ( [ regija ] ) . there is a simple bijection between the two regions :",
    "if @xmath37 is a point in @xmath113 corresponding to the state @xmath62 , then @xmath114 is a point in the @xmath111 region , and vice versa .",
    "imagine that 1 ebit of entanglement were a stronger resource that 1 bit of communication , in the sense that the latter could be produced form the former",
    ". then the @xmath111 region would be trivially achievable by the achievability of the @xmath113 region .",
    "the opposite would hold were 1 bit stronger than 1 ebit . however , it is well known that bits and ebits are incomparable resources .",
    "the correspondence between the two regions may be interpreted as providing a limited sense in which bits and ebits may be thought of as equally strong .",
    "one may play the same game in the context of scenario i ( a or b ) , with a somewhat less interesting outcome . here",
    "a negative rate @xmath110 is interpreted as assistance by a noiseless quantum channel .",
    "it is known @xcite that the classical capacity of a noiseless channel combined with a noisy one is just the sum of the individual capacities .",
    "hence the scenario i continuation of our trade - off curve simply follows the linear outer bound into the @xmath115 region ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "is now given to the eavesdropper ) , the simultaneous ( public , private ) capacity region is given by the following modification of theorem 1 :    * replace the state @xmath63 by @xmath236 , obtained by sending the @xmath8 part of @xmath237 through the channel , * replace @xmath238 by @xmath239 .",
    "the corresponding theorem for classical `` wire - tap''channels was proven in @xcite .",
    "secondly , one may conceive of a `` static '' analogue of the problem considered here , where alice and bob share many copies of some ( mixed ) state @xmath76 instead of being connected by a quantum channel . in @xcite",
    "the problem of generating common randomness ( perfectly correlated bits ) from such a resource using limited forward ( alice to bob ) classical communication was considered . there",
    "the `` distillable common randomness '' ( dcr ) was defined to be the maximum common randomness obtainable _ in excess _ of the classical communication invested , and was advertised as an ( asymmetric ) measure of the classical correlations in @xmath76 . in @xcite the problem of one - way entanglement distillation was solved , yielding a similarly asymmetric measure of _ quantum _ correlations in @xmath76 . the next step is to unify the two results in a trade - off between dcr and distillable entanglement , which could now be argued to quantify the _ total _ correlations in the state .",
    "based on the results of @xcite , @xcite and the present paper we put forth the following conjecture : the simultaneously distillable ( classical , quantum ) resources are given precisely by theorem 1 , where now the test states @xmath63 are obtained by applying general instruments @xmath240 to the @xmath44 part of @xmath76 , rather than arising from a channel .",
    "a sketch of the proof is as follows .",
    "the coding strategy involves double blocking .",
    "first use the protocol of @xcite on a block of length @xmath10 to establish a good approximation to @xmath241 on bob s side using @xmath242 bits of forward communication .",
    "this already gives us the desired dcr rate of @xmath243 .",
    "now that bob s system includes @xmath241 they may use further blocking to distill entanglement at a rate of @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "the classical communication involved in this distillation has now turned into common randomness , effecting no net change in the dcr .",
    "the converse theorem is left as an exercise .",
    "a somewhat more ambitious goal would be to include the classical communication cost in the trade - off , giving a 3-dimensional region !",
    "the final remark we make is that the `` piggy - backing '' idea used in the proof of theorem 1 provides an alternative coding strategy to the one in @xcite for the classical capacity of @xmath3 with limited entanglement assistance , thus establishing an additional connection between the two problems .",
    "the original paper on the entanglement assisted capacity @xcite describes how to achieve the pair @xmath245 , for some @xmath246 arising from the channel . using a mixture of codes corresponding to different channel inputs",
    "@xmath53 , one trivially achieves @xmath247 ( with respect to @xmath248 ) .",

    "in conclusion , an information theoretical characterization of the simultaneous ( classical , quantum ) capacity region has been derived . the key idea was to use a different quantum code depending on the classical information to be sent , thus `` piggy - backing '' the classical information on top of the quantum one .",
    "the formula derived requires optimization over potentially arbitrarily many copies of the channel .",
    "we have shown that for a generalized dephasing channel a single copy suffices .",

    "we have already mentioned the open problem of including the classical communication cost in the trade - off for the static analogue .",
    "another interesting extension of our work , which in fact served as our original motivation , is the following joint source - channel coding problem . in @xcite",
    "the task of quantum compression with classical side information was considered .",
    "this is a `` visible '' source coding problem of a pure - state ensemble @xmath55 . by storing partial information about the identity of the states ( classically ) at a rate @xmath249 it is possible to reduce the quantum storage rate to some value @xmath250 .",
    "the joint source - channel coding variant of this problem is : given @xmath55 and a channel @xmath3 , what is the rate at which alice can send the quantum part of the ensemble over the channel ?",
    "one approach is to first separate the source into a classical and quantum part using the trade - off of @xcite and then send them simultaneously through the channel using the trade - off of theorem 1 .",
    "this procedure is optimized over the ratio @xmath251 of the classical and quantum rates which should coincide for the source and channel coding part .",
    "there are , however `` well matched '' source - channel pairs for which such a strategy is known to be suboptimal .",
    "the following example is due to smolin @xcite .",
    "the source is the equiprobable `` trine '' ensemble @xmath252 , where @xmath253 and the channel @xmath254 has operation elements @xmath255 .",
    "the channel has no quantum capacity and a classical capacity of @xmath256 .",
    "our strategy of separating the source and channel coding gives a source - channel capacity of @xmath257 transmitted copies of the ensemble per channel use . on the other hand ,",
    "by simply feeding the identity of the state to the channel one achieves a source - channel capacity of @xmath256 . finding a solution for an arbitrary @xmath258 pair remains an open question .",

    "i d is partially supported by the nsa under the aro grant numbers daag55 - 98-c-0041 and daad19 - 01 - 1 - 06 .",
    "here we provide a proof that the region @xmath80 defined by ( [ regija ] ) is concave .",
    "let @xmath259 and @xmath260 be two different states arising from the channel . for some @xmath251 between @xmath261 and @xmath256 ,",
    "consider the state @xmath262 which also arises from the channel .",
    "then @xmath263 from which the claim follows .",
    "in this section we define the notion of _ degradable channels _ and show that for such channels the quantum capacity is given by the single - letter formula q ( ) = q^(1 ) ( ) : = _",
    "^ab i(a b ) , where the maximization is over all states @xmath76 arising from the channel @xmath3 .",
    "for the special case of _ dephasing _ channels we shall prove that the entire trade - off curve can be single - letterized .",
    "recall that a channel @xmath264 can be defined by an isometric embedding @xmath234 , followed by a partial trace over the `` environment '' system @xmath55 , so @xmath265 @xcite .",
    "this further induces the _ complementary channel _ @xmath266 defined by @xmath267 .",
    "we call a channel @xmath3 _ degradable _ when it may be degraded to its complementary channel @xmath268 , i.e. when there exists a map @xmath269 so that @xmath270 .    to see that @xmath271 for degradable channels , note that bob s output system @xmath9 may be mapped by a fixed isometry onto a composite system @xmath272 such that the channels from @xmath8 to @xmath273 and to @xmath55 are the same .",
    "thus , for any state arising from the channel , @xmath274 we can then use the inequality @xmath275 to prove that single - letter maximization already achieves @xmath5 .",
    "a subclass of degradable channels of particular interest are generalized dephasing channels .",
    "the latter are defined on some @xmath124-dimensional hilbert space with a preferred orthonormal basis @xmath276 , such that all states belonging to this basis are transmitted without error , but pure superpositions of these basis states may become mixed .",
    "this implies that if @xmath3 is a dephasing channel then its isometric embedding @xmath233 obeys @xmath277 where the @xmath278 are generally not mutually orthogonal .",
    "when the @xmath278 are mutually orthogonal @xmath3 is the completely dephasing channel @xmath279 : @xmath280 it is clear from the above that any dephasing channel @xmath3 obeys    * @xmath281 * @xmath282    every dephasing channel is degradable , since @xmath3 may be degraded to @xmath279 which may be further degraded to @xmath268 . in fact , the map @xmath283 can be taken to be @xmath268 .",
    "therefore , @xmath271 in what follows , the special properties of dephasing channels will allow us to prove an even stronger statement : that the outer boundary of @xmath98 may be expressed as a single - letter formula .",
    "consider some state @xmath284 arising from the channel .",
    "bob may degrade his channel further by replacing his system @xmath9 by @xmath285 , where @xmath286 now contains the completely dephased version of @xmath9 ( this is why we label it as a classical system ) .",
    "set @xmath287 and define @xmath288,\\ ] ] where the maximization is over all @xmath289 arising from the channel ( @xmath289 is implicit in the entropies ) .",
    "we shall make use of the following lemma .",
    "for two general dephasing channels @xmath290 and @xmath291 @xmath292    * proof * the `` @xmath293 '' direction follows from the fact that the input ensemble for @xmath294 may be chosen to be a tensor product of the ones maximizing @xmath295 and @xmath296 . to show the opposite inequality , in what follows",
    "let us refer to the state @xmath297 that maximizes @xmath298 .",
    "observe that @xmath299 and @xmath300 the latter since @xmath301 contains a degraded version of @xmath302 for all values of @xmath58 .",
    "hence @xmath303    ' '' ''    we shall use lagrange multipliers to calculate @xmath98 . by theorem 1 ,",
    "the quantity to be maximized is @xmath304 over all states @xmath305 that arise from @xmath130 .",
    "operationally it is clear that we should restrict attention to @xmath287 , since @xmath306 is the the slope of the boundary of @xmath98 and a qubit channel may always be used to send classical bits at a unit rate . for any such state",
    "we have @xmath307 the first inequality follows from the fact that complete dephasing increases entropy , and is saturated by completely dephasing the _ input _ to @xmath130 ( recall that @xmath3 commutes with @xmath279 ) .",
    "the third inequality is by lemma 6 .",
    "thus , for dephasing channels , @xmath308 , which makes the optimization problem tractable .",
    "we now turn to the particular case of the qubit @xmath60-dephasing channel @xmath309 it is easily checked that the outer boundary of of @xmath98 is achieved by the @xmath11parametrized family of ensembles , @xmath310 $ ] , consisting of @xmath311 and @xmath312 chosen with equal probabilities .",
    "the trade - off curve is given by @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the binary entropy function .",
    "figure 2 shows this curve for @xmath315 .",
    "here we justify the condition on the cardinality of @xmath82 in the statement of theorem 1 .",
    "caratheodory s theorem states that in a @xmath316-dimensional euclidean space , each point of a connected compact set @xmath317 can be represented as a convex combination of at most @xmath318 points in @xmath317 .",
    "let @xmath319 be the family of all density operators on the hilbert space @xmath7 of dimension @xmath124 .",
    "let @xmath317 be the image of @xmath319 under some continuous mapping @xmath202 defined by @xmath320 . as @xmath319 is connected and compact , so is @xmath317 .",
    "then for any probability measure @xmath11 on the algebra of density operators of @xmath7 , caratheodory s theorem implies the existence of some finite ensemble @xmath321 , @xmath322 , such that @xmath323.\\ ] ] turning to our problem , the quantities @xmath243 and @xmath324 depend solely on the ensemble @xmath325 , where @xmath326 , and the channel @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , they only depend on the vector @xmath327 , where the vector valued function @xmath202 is defined so that @xmath328 are the @xmath329 degrees of freedom of @xmath22 ( linear in @xmath22 ) , @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "suppose that a particular point in @xmath80 corresponds to some ensemble @xmath332 .",
    "the above implies that the same point is achievable by a finite ensemble with at most @xmath333 elements .",
