    "<S> single photon source is one of the key devices for optical quantum information processing . differing from the usual stimulated raman adiabatic passage to obtain single - photon radiation , </S>",
    "<S> here we propose an approach to produce optical fock state on demand in the usual atom - cavity system by utilizing the technique of transitionless quantum driving . </S>",
    "<S> the present proposal effectively suppresses the unwanted but practically unavoidable nonadiabatic transitions in the previous adiabatic schemes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the efficiency of fock state production by the present technique could be significantly high , even in the presence of various atomic and cavity dissipations .    </S>",
    "<S> november 2014    _ keywords _ : high efficiency , single photon , transitionless quantum driving    due to the various applications in quantum information processing , the production of nonclassical states of light has been one of the most attractive topics both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> physically , manipulating the atoms in a cavity by using the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite , single - photon fock state emission could be achieved  @xcite . however , owing to the practically - existing non - adiabatic transitions between the designed evolution passages  @xcite , the efficiency of fock state production ( fsp ) is strongly limited  @xcite .    to avoid the influence of non - adiabatic transitions on the efficiency and speed up the fast fsp , in this letter we propose an approach by using an alternative technique , named the transitionless quantum driving ( tqd ) or shortcut to adiabatic passage ( shape ) , to achieve the desirable fsp with high efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea of this technique  @xcite is to find a driving @xmath0 to evolve the system along a selected instantaneous eigenstate @xmath1 of the initial hamiltonian @xmath2 exactly . during this driving any transition from this instantaneous eigenstate @xmath1 to the other ones \\{@xmath3 @xmath4 } </S>",
    "<S> is effectively suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> formally , the hamiltonian for such a tqd can be expressed as @xmath5  @xcite with @xmath6 as @xmath7 is supplemented to @xmath8 , the dynamics of the system can be restricted along the instantaneous eigenstate @xmath1 beyond the adiabatic limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this technique could be used to speed up the population passages for high - efficiency quantum state controls by introducing various classical pulses  @xcite . here , with the full quantized atom - cavity interaction </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how to apply the tqd technique to achieve the high efficiency single - photon fsp with the usual double @xmath9-level atom interacting with a single - mode high - q cavity . </S>",
    "<S> although the similar configuration had been used to implement the production of single photon by using the stirap technique ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the present proposal possesses a manifest advantage : the population transfer for the fsp could be implemented fast ( as it is beyond the adiabatic limit ) and deterministically ( as it does not yield any unwanted leakage from the driven states ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the desirable fsp can be achieved with a significantly high efficiency .    </S>",

    "<S> effective three - level @xmath9 atomic configuration formed by adiabatically eliminating the auxiliary level @xmath10.,width=340 ]    the configuration of the atom - cavity system for our proposal is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the atom consists of two excited states @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and two ground states @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coupled by classical pumps @xmath16 and @xmath17 , while transitions @xmath18 and @xmath15 is coupled to a cavity mode with coupling coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> two detunings @xmath21 and @xmath22 are relative to the non - resonant transitions by the classical pumps and cavity couplings . in a rotating frame , defined by @xmath23}|e\\rangle\\langle e|+\\exp{(-i\\omega_{g_2}t)}|g_2\\rangle\\langle g_2|+\\exp{[-i(\\omega_{e_m}-\\delta_m ) t]}|e_m\\rangle\\langle e_m|$ ] , the hamiltonian of this system @xmath24 reads ( @xmath25 )  @xcite @xmath26 here , @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath28 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity mode with the frequency @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are the raising operators of the atom . the detunings respect to the following equations , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 being the eigenfrequencies of the four atomic levels ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that , the energy invariant subspace related to the hamiltonian @xmath39 is formed by the following dressed states : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( here we assume that the cavity mode is initially prepared in the vacuum state @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the desirable single - photon fsp requires the system should be manipulated deterministically from the ground state @xmath40 to the target state @xmath43  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this progress had been achieved by the stirap technique with a @xmath9-level atom - cavity system , the efficiency of the desirable fsp is significantly limited due to the undesired non - adiabatic transitions . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen below that these transitions could be effectively suppressed by introducing the drivings related to the auxiliary excited state @xmath10 .    in principle , the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( 2 ) can be rewritten as @xmath45 in the atomic - level subspace @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and the `` coefficients '' @xmath48 . in the far - off - resonant case , </S>",
    "<S> the upper atomic state @xmath10 can be effectively eliminated  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath49 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> an effective raman atom - photon coupling @xmath50 is delivered  @xcite , and then the above double @xmath9-level atom - cavity system is reduced to an effective three - level @xmath9 one ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an effective hamiltonian is delivered in the atomic space \\{@xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath13 } @xmath51 during the derivation , all the stark shifts of the relevant energy levels are neglected as they do not affect the following progress for the fsp . </S>",
    "<S> formally , the above hamiltonian ( [ eq:4 ] ) can be written as @xmath52 , wherein @xmath53 describes the usual progress of stirap in the effective three - level @xmath9 atom - cavity system , and @xmath54 illustrates the effective raman atom - photon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath55 affects the efficiency of single photon generation .    in the subspace @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily check that the instantaneous eigenstates \\{@xmath1 } of the hamiltonian @xmath8 read , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . here , </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , whereas @xmath64 . in the previous stirap technique , </S>",
    "<S> the single - photon fsp is realized by the the dark state manipulation , i.e. , the system evolves along the @xmath65-path via adiabatically adjusting the mixed angle @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the adiabatic condition is not be satisfied exactly , the non - adiabatic transitions from the driven dark state to the bright states @xmath66 will take place@xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the above manipulation induces unwanted errors . in our proposal , once the effective raman atom - photon coupling satisfy the condition @xmath67/\\omega^2 $ ] from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) , a shortcut to stirap is found and the undesired non - adiabatic transition can be suppressed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the population from @xmath40 to @xmath43 , i.e. , the expected single - photon emission can be achieved beyond the adiabatic limit .     </S>",

    "<S> comparison of single - photon fsps by the stirap and tqd techniques . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) ( with @xmath81 ) shows that the usual stirap could not be perfectly realized , i.e. , the final population of the target state @xmath43 can not reach unit ( e.g. , only about @xmath82 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> when an auxiliary driving @xmath69 is applied additionally , then the desired tqd is implemented and completely population passage from the initial state @xmath40 to the target one @xmath43 is achieved . this is numerically verified in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) , which indicates the single - photon fock state of the cavity mode is generated perfectly . </S>",
    "<S> the above argument clearly shows that the tqd , rather than the usual stirap , provides a high efficient approach to deliver a single photon emission .    </S>",
    "<S> we now compared the robustness of the above stirap- and tqd - based single - photon fsp in the presence of the dissipations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , atomic spontaneous emissions from excited state and photon absorption by the cavity mirrors are the main dissipation for the single photon generations  @xcite . in the present of dissipation , the dynamics of the above effective @xmath9 atom - cavity system is alternatively described by the following master equation  @xcite : @xmath83 with @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> above , @xmath85 is the reduced density operator , @xmath86 is the atomic spontaneous emission rate , and @xmath87 the cavity dissipation . by solving the above master equation , </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent mean photon number : @xmath88 in the cavity , and the mandel factor @xmath89/\\langle \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a}\\rangle$ ] describing the single - photon quality can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider the pulse sequence schematized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](d ) . in the absence of dissipation , </S>",
    "<S> the ideal population passage for single - photon fsp can be implemented by both the designed stirap and tqd , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](e ) . however , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](f ) shows that in the presence of dissipation the quality of the single - photon emission generated by the tqd is obviously higher than that by the stirap .    </S>",
    "<S> certainly , if the population transfer is strictly going alone the dark state evolution , i.e. , the excited state @xmath41 has been never populated , then the desired single - photon fsp will be realized perfectly . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the significantly large amplitude @xmath90 of the drivings in the stirap . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the tqd we do not care how strong the amplitude @xmath90 but just apply a proper auxiliary driving @xmath91 to implement the exact dark state evolution . </S>",
    "<S> during such a perfect dark state evolution the excited state @xmath41 has never been populated . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the tqd is more robust than the stirap against the dissipation .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) . </S>",
    "<S> single - photon fsp without adiabatically eliminating the level @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) exciting pulses : @xmath19 , @xmath68 , @xmath20 and @xmath17 . here , we consider the simplified case @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) time - dependent populations during the double @xmath9-level atom - cavity system.,width=340 ]    to implement the technique of our tqd , the most crucial step is to realize the effective raman atom - photon coupling between the states @xmath40 and @xmath43 by adiabatically eliminating the auxiliary state @xmath10 . for simplicity , we assume that the pulses @xmath20 and @xmath17 are designed as the same shape , e.g. , @xmath93}/\\beta$ ] with @xmath94 and @xmath95}+\\exp{[-2(t-\\tau_p)^2/t^2]}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the population dynamics of the double @xmath9-level atom - cavity system can be numerically solved and the relevant results are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] for , e.g. , @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear to see that the population dynamics of the state @xmath10 is very small and completely population transfer from state @xmath40 to @xmath97 is robustly realized . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the auxiliary state @xmath10 can be adiabatically eliminated really . certainly , as @xmath98 , the condition @xmath99 still holds and thus we can still eliminate the state @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] gives a directly evidence that the efficiency of the single - photon fsp by the tqd is much higher than that by the stirap .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a robust technique to produce single - photon fock state on demand with a double @xmath9-level atom in a single - mode cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the auxiliary driving to implement the transitionless evolution is introduced by using an auxiliary level @xmath10 . by effectively eliminating such an level </S>",
    "<S> , the effective raman atom - photon coupling makes the system evolve exactly along the relevant dark state path . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have also analyzed specifically the quality of the proposed tqd - based single - photon fsp by numerically solving the relevant master equation . </S>",
    "<S> the results showed that , the proposal is still robust in the presence of dissipation of the considered atom - cavity system . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully , arbitrary multi - photon fock states can also be produced by designing the relevant transitionless quantum drivings . given the stirap technique </S>",
    "<S> have being taken the important role in atomic physics and quantum optics , the tqd - based fsps proposed here should be implementable with the current cavity - qed experiments . </S>",
