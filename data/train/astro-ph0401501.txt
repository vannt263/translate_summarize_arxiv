    "the name blazars identifies a family of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) showing a rather complex phenomenology : extreme variability at all wavelengths , polarization , strong @xmath5ray emission , brightness temperatures exceeding the compton limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large amount of work done in the last decade has led to a rather general consensus on the global mechanism responsible for the emission : a rotating black hole surrounded by a massive accretion disk with an intense plasma jet closely aligned to the line of sight .",
    "relativistic electrons produce the soft photons through synchrotron emission , while hard photons are produced by inverse compton scattering .",
    "this overall scenario , however , still presents a large number of poorly understood details which , in turn , lead to a wide variety of models and call for long term and multi  wavelength campaigns capable to provide the necessary observational constraints .",
    "variability measurements provide key information on the agn structure , down to linear scales or flux density levels not accessible with interferometric imaging .",
    "the most extensive blazar monitoring campaigns have been carried out at radio frequencies .",
    "the university of michigan monitoring program at 4.8 , 8.0 and 14.5 ghz has obtained data on over 200 sources for over three decades . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the metshovi group ( tersranta et al . 1998 ) have reported observations at 22 , 37 and 87 ghz of 157 extragalactic radio sources , many of which have been monitored for over 20 years . the bologna group ( bondi et al . 1996 ) have observed at 408 mhz 125 radio sources for 15 years .",
    "a multifrequency monitoring of large sample of compact radio sources has been carried out by kovalev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with the ratan-600 telescope .",
    "the mechanisms for variability are still not well understood .",
    "possibilities discussed in the literature include shocks in jets ( marscher & gear 1985 ; aller , aller & hughes 1985 ; marscher 1996 ) and changes in the direction of forward beaming [ due , e.g. to helical trajectories of plasma elements ( camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ) or to a precessing binary black - hole system ( begelman et al .",
    "1980 ; sillanp et al .",

    "we are interested , in particular , in utilizing it to predict the effect of radio - source variability on the high - frequency all - sky surveys to be carried out by esa s planck mission .",
    "such predictions are useful to plan the quick - look analysis of planck data and to organize follow - up observations . to this end ,",
    "the metshovi data , taken at frequencies close to those of planck - lfi ( low frequency instrument ) channels , are particularly well fit .",
    "another very interesting , highly debated issue , is the possible presence of periodicities in the blazar light curves .",

    "the use of unbiased samples is essential for meaningful statistical analyses .",
    "the umrao group have monitored and analyzed the light curves of two complete samples , the pearson - readhead sample ( aller et al .",

    "the final sample comprises 39 sources ( 24 fsrqs and 15 lbls ) , listed in table  [ usample ] ( u sample ) . of these sources ,",
    "25 ( 9 lbls and 16 fsrqs ) were also extensively monitored by the metshovi group ( u@xmath12 m sample ) .",
    "of the 24 fsrqs , 21 are classified as either hpq ( 12 ) or lpq ( 9 ) ; the acronyms stand for high- or low - polarization quasars , respectively .",
    "redshift determinations are available for all sources . to characterize the variability properties at the various frequencies we have computed the variability index ( v.i .",
    ") , the structure function ( simonetti et al .",
    "1985 ; hughes et al . 1992 ) , and the distribution of intensity variations .",
    "the variability index has been computed allowing for measurement errors following aller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : @xmath13 again following aller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we have excluded anomalously noisy data , i.e. data with @xmath14 .      table  [ vi ] gives the mean values of the variability index ( v.i . ) and their errors at 4.8 , 8 , 14.5 , 22 , and 37 ghz for the 25 blazars ( 9 lbls and 16 fsrqs ) in the u@xmath12 m sample .",
    "of the 16 fsrqs , 9 are hpqs and 7 are lpqs ; we have also computed the v.i . for each of these sub - classes . at all frequencies",
    "we get systematically higher v.i.s for lbls than for fsrqs ( see also fig .",
    "[ viplot ] ) , consistent with the results by aller et al .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test shows that the differences among the two populations are significant : the probability that the two distributions come from the same parent population is @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , at 37 , 22 , 14.5 , 8 , and 4.8 ghz respectively ( see table  [ tabsfviks ] ) .    the mean v.i . of fsrq is higher at higher frequencies : it is @xmath20 at 4.8 ghz and becomes @xmath21 at 37 ghz .",
    "again , the ks test confirm that the effect is statistically significant : the probability that the distributions at 4.8 and 37 ghz come from the same parent population is @xmath22 .",
    "the frequency dependence is less clear in the case of lbls , which have large v.i.s at all frequencies .",
    "still , their mean v.i .",
    "increases from @xmath23 at 4.8 ghz to @xmath24 at @xmath25ghz ; the significance of the difference between the distributions at the two frequencies is @xmath26 .",
    "the frequency dependence of the v.i .",
    "is consistent with the notion that , at lower and lower frequencies , an increasing fraction of the observed emission is produced on larger and larger scales and is therefore less variable on the timescales covered by monitoring programs . at all frequencies the mean v.i .",
    "of high - polarization quasars ( hpqs ) is slightly higher than that of low - polarization quasars ( lpqs ) ; the difference , however , has always a low statistical significance .",
    "another useful method for quantitatively investigating variability properties is the so called structure function ( s.f . )",
    "analysis ( simonetti et al . 1985 ; hughes et al . 1992 ) .",
    "we have computed the quantities commonly used to characterize the first order s.f . ,",

    "in fig .  [ sfper ]",
    "we show the structure functions at 22 ghz for the 4 sources for which we have the best evidence of periodicity .",
    "the value of the derived period is indicated by the vertical line , while the dotted horizontal line corresponds to the variance of the process .",

    "[ sfslope ] and [ sftimescale ] , respectively .",
    "panels corresponding to frequencies of up to 14.5 ghz refer to the 39 sources in the u sample , those at higher frequencies to the 25 sources in the u@xmath12 m sample .",
    "mean values and dispersions are given in tables  [ tabsfslope ] and [ tabsftimescale ] .",
    "slopes and time - scales ( or lower limits ) could be determined for essentially all sources .",
    "the exceptions ( sources with very irregular s.f . ) are just one at 14.5 and 8 ghz , and 3 at 4.8 ghz .",
    "for the sources ( 2 at 37 and 22 ghz , 10 at 14.5 ghz , 11 at 8 and 4.8 ghz ) not showing a plateau we adopted the time base of the data as a lower limit to the time - scale .",
    "we further have a small number of sources with a plateau ( 1 at 37 ghz , 4 at 14.5 ghz , 1 at 8 ghz , and 2 at 4.8 ghz ) or a change of slope ( 1 at 37 ghz , 2 at 22 ghz , 5 at 14.5 ghz , and 4 at 8 and at 4.8 ghz ) at intermediate time lag , which may signal the transition between two different processes ; in these cases we have adopted the longer time - scale . for sources with a change of slope",
    "we have chosen the steeper value .",
    "the average time - scale tend to be somewhat longer ( although the statistical significance of the difference between 37 and 4.8 ghz is , for the full sample , only @xmath29 ) , and the fraction of sources with time - scale exceeding the data time span is larger at lower frequencies .",
    "the indication , reported by hughes et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , that lbls have , on average , shorter timescales than fsrqs is not statistically significant in the source frames ( see table  [ tabsftimescale ] ) .",
    "there is a marginal indication ( significance of @xmath30 based on the ks test at 8 ghz ) of longer timescales for lpqs , compared to hpqs .",
    "no statistically significant variations with frequency of the slope distribution are detected .",
    "a visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ sfslope ] indicates that fsrqs tend to have steeper slopes than lbls .",
    "the average slope of lbls is @xmath31 , the value corresponding to shot noise . in the the case of fsrqs , the distributions are somewhat broader and",
    "extend to values @xmath32 , particularly at lower frequencies , consistent with the previous findings by hughes et al .",
    "the ks test yields a probability of @xmath29 at 4.8 ghz and of @xmath33 at 8 ghz that the distributions for the two populations come from the same parent distribution .",
    "no statistically significant differences are found at higher frequencies .",
    "the distributions of lpqs and hpqs are consistent with the same parent population at all frequencies .",
    "possible hints of a correlation of time - scales with slopes were noted by hughes et al .",
    "a pearson s test however does not detect any significant correlation among these quantities either for the entire sample or for any sub - population .      as shown by fig .",
    "[ pdf ] , the distribution of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the instantaneous flux density at a given frequency and @xmath36 is its average value , broadens with increasing frequency , consistent with the notion the the variability amplitude increases with frequency ( impey & neugebauer 1988 ) .",
    "the frequency dependence of the variance , @xmath37 , of the distribution is approximately linear .",

    "[ pdf ] , is given by : @xmath38 the shape of the distribution also changes somewhat with frequency . at high frequencies ( 22 and 37 ghz ) ,",
    "the distribution of intensity fluctuations approaches a log - normal distribution , while at lower frequencies , the distribution of @xmath34 is better described by a laplace or by a cauchy distribution .",
    "the frequency dependencies of the skewness and of the kurtosis are shown in the middle and on the bottom part of the panel on the lower right - hand corner of fig .",

    "variability enhances the bright portion of the luminosity function and of source counts .",
    "we have estimated its effect on the 37 and 100 ghz counts of fsrqs and of bl lacs by convolving the epoch - dependent luminosity functions given by maraschi & rovetti ( 1994 ) and urry & padovani ( 1995 ) , respectively , with the distribution function of intensity fluctuation shown in the corresponding panel of fig .",

    "[ counts ] , the enhancement of the counts is of about 2030% at the brightest flux densities .",
    "it is thus very likely that a substantial fraction of blazars picked up by the high - frequency , shallow surveys carried out by the wmap ( bennett et al . 2003 ) and planck satellites are in a flaring stage .     with variance given by eq .",

    "combining the long - term monitoring databases of the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) and of the metshovi radio observatory it is possible to investigate the radio variability properties of a rather rich sample of fsrqs and lbls over about a decade in frequency .",
    "our approach has followed different lines of investigation .",
    "first , we have addressed the still controversial issue of the existence of periodicities in the radio light curves .",
    "in addition to the well known periodogram method , modified to take into account the effect of uneven sampling , we have applied a more effective technique , never used before in this context , based on the analysis of the signal autocorrelation matrix .",
    "we have analyzed the metshovi light curves looking for periods shorter than 50% of the maximum admissible period ( to avoid aliasing ) and detectable ( with the same value within the errors ) at both 22 and 37 ghz .",
    "we have found evidences , confirmed by both techniques , for periodicities in the light curves of 5 ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) out of the 77 metshovi sources having sufficient time coverage for a meaningful analysis to be carried out .",
    "for the last three of these sources , consistent periods are found also at the three umrao frequencies , while in the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( which were monitored for a relatively short time at metshovi ) umrao data give hints of ill - defined periods a factor of 2 larger than at the metshovi frequencies .",
    "the lomb periodogram method allows us to test quantitatively the significance of the detected periodicities . as shown by scargle ( 1982 ) , the false - alarm probability , i.e. the probability that , if we scan @xmath39 independent frequencies , none has spectral power normalized to the variance of the data larger than @xmath40 , under the null hypothesis that the data are independent random gaussian values , is : @xmath41 an accurate evaluation of @xmath42 is complicated by the difficulty of estimating @xmath39 ( press et al .",
    "1996 , p. 570 ) .",
    "however , for any reasonable choice of @xmath39 , @xmath42 turns out to be extremely small ( and therefore the significance of the peak in the power spectrum corresponding to the detected period is very high ) for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ( @xmath40 amounts to several tens at all frequencies ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the false alarms probability may be quite significant for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as a further test",
    ", we have applied the kolmogorov - smirnov test to examine the consistency of the data distribution with a gaussian random process .",
    "this possibility is ruled out for @xmath2 and @xmath4 , but not for the other sources .",
    "we have also investigated the variability index , the structure function , and the distribution of intensity variations of the most extensively monitored sources .",
    "we considered umrao sources classified either as low - energy peak bl lacs or flat - spectrum radio quasars , monitored at 8 ghz for a total of @xmath10 days , with gaps not exceeding 200 days , all times being computed _ in the source frame_. the sample comprises 39 sources ( 24 fsrqs and 15 lbls ) , 25 of which ( 9 lbls and 16 fsrqs ) were also extensively monitored by the metshovi group .",
    "we have found a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the variability index for lbls compared to fsrqs , in the sense that the former are more variable .",
    "this difference may help shedding light on the relationship between the two blazar sub - classes and is consistent with lbls having a higher ratio of beamed to unbeamed emission than fsrqs ( fan 2003 ) .    for both populations",
    "the variability index steadily increases with increasing frequency .",
    "the distribution of intensity variations also broadens with increasing frequency , and approaches a log - normal shape at the highest frequencies .",
    "variability enhances by 2030% , at bright flux densities , the high frequency counts of extragalactic radio - sources , such as those which will be carried out by the wmap and planck satellites .",
    "since the sample is not complete , one should worry about possible selection biases . to test this possibility",
    "we have extracted from it a sub - sample 80% complete to a flux limit of 1.2 jy over the three areas @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "such sub - sample comprises only 16 objects ( 6 lbls and 10 fsrqs ) and is thus too small for our purposes . on the other hand",
    ", we did not detect significant differences in the mean properties of sources in the sample of 39 compared to those in the almost complete sub - sample .",
    "also the trends with frequency and the differences among sub - populations are still present . we are therefore confident that , although the sample is not complete , it is essentially unbiased .",

    "<S> the distribution of intensity variations also broadens with increasing frequency , and approaches a log - normal shape at the highest frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that variability enhances by 2030% the high frequency counts of extragalactic radio - sources at bright flux densities , such as those of the wmap and planck surveys . in all objects with detected periodicity </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for the existence of impulsive signals superimposed on the periodic component . </S>"
