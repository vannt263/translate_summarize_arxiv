    "a solution to the knee and ankle problem has been recently proposed [ 1 - 4 ] with a major characteristic feature consisting of a fundamental connection between the knee and the ankle mainly based on some data on the milky way ( size , magnetic field , gas density ) and nuclear interaction lengths of cosmic ions in the interstellar medium .",
    "the knees and ankles of individual ions are generated by galactic cosmic rays , though a tiny extragalactic component might be admitted .",
    "the upper energy boundary of @xmath0 ev marks the iron ankle [ 2 ] in the energy region of the quasi rectilinear propagation of iron nuclei through the galaxy .",
    "the present study assumes that this solution does exist as reported elsewhere [ 1 - 4 ] and it explores some consequences regarding : ( 1 ) the chemical composition of the cosmic radiation above the knee up to @xmath0 ev ; ( 2 ) some basic constraints on the acceleration mechanism in the milky way ; ( 3 ) the residence time of galactic cosmic rays and its relevance pertaining to the level of isotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays at earth .",
    "no new elements of the theory are introduced in this study .",
    "other salient consequences of the common origin of the knee and the ankle are not discussed due to the paper size limitation .",
    "for example , the existence of the second knee around @xmath9 ev [ 5,6 ] is an intrinsic property of the energy spectra resulting from this theory .",
    "a second example is that the iron knee is less pronounced than the knees of the lighter ions , in particular those of helium and proton",
    ". this circumstance may be quite fruitful while searching for the iron knee in the energy region @xmath5-@xmath10 ev as aimed at by the kascade - grande experiment , presently in data taking [ 7 ] .",

    "a logical partition of this theory would identify two areas : ( 1 ) the simulation of cosmic - ray trajectories in the galaxy , detailed in the quoted papers [ 1 - 4 ] and others [ 10 - 12 ] ; ( 2 ) the introduction of a new postulate , a fundamental part of the theory , which states that the spectral indices of all ions have constant , common values of about @xmath13 up to @xmath14 ev .",
