    "the spin - orbit coupling leads to a zero - field spin splitting , and it competes with the zeeman spin splitting when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied . the result can be detected as beating in shubnikov - de haas oscillations.@xcite    very recently we have studied the spin hall effect in the 2deg with spin - orbit coupling in a strong perpendicular magnetic field , and predicted a resonant spin hall effect caused by the landau level crossing near the fermi energy.@xcite in this paper we present detailed calculations of the problem .",

    "we have calculated the temperature and electric field dependences of the resonance .",
    "the characteristic temperature for the resonant spin hall current is of order of the zeeman energy .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the height of the resonance peak diverge like @xmath234 and the weight diverges like @xmath235 . while the spin orbit coupling has a dramatic effect on the spin hall conductance , the charge hall conductance is not affected and remains quantized .",

    "the effects of disorder in 2deg with rashba coupling , especially in a strong magnetic field , is not well understood at this point.@xcite nevertheless , it seems reasonable to assume that the spin - orbit coupling does not change the effects of disorder qualitatively .",
    "this is likely to be the case in the presence of a strong magnetic field , which ensures extended states in the landau levels when the disorder is not sufficiently strong as evidenced by the experimentally observed quantization of the hall conductance .",
    "we then assume that the disorder gives rise to broadening of the landau level and localization so that the extended states in a landau levels are separate in energy from those in the next one by localized states .",
    "inspection of the spin - orbit coupling shows that laughlin s gauge argument still holdslaughlin , halperin , and each landau level with its extended states completely filled contribute @xmath238 to the charge hall conductance .",
    "thus we conclude that the quantum hall conductance remains intact with the spin - orbit interaction , except at the special degeneracy point .",

    "<S> the rashba coupling , generated by spin - orbit interaction in wells lacking bulk inversion symmetry , introduces a degeneracy of zeeman - split landau levels at certain magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> this degeneracy , if occuring at the fermi energy , will induce a resonance in the spin hall conductance below a characteristic temperature of order of the zeeman energy . at very low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the spin hall current is highly non - ohmic . </S>",
    "<S> the dresselhaus coupling due to the lack of structure inversion symmetry partially or completely suppresses the spin hall resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for the resonant spin hall conductance in the presence of both rashba and dresselhaus couplings is derived using a perturbation method . in the presence of disorder , </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the resonant spin hall conductance occurs when the two zeeman split extended states near the fermi level becomes degenerate due to the rashba coupling and that the the quantized charge hall conductance changes by @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 as the magnetic field changes through the resonant field . </S>"
