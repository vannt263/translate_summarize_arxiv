    "<S> we have observed an unexpected enhancement of the lower critical field @xmath0 and the critical current @xmath1 deep in the superconducting state below @xmath2 k ( @xmath3 ) in the filled skutterudite heavy fermion superconductor pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 . from a comparison of the behavior of @xmath0 with that of the heavy fermion superconductors u@xmath6th@xmath7be@xmath8 and upt@xmath9 , we speculate that the enhancement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 reflects a transition into another superconducting phase that occurs below @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> an examination of the literature reveals unexplained anomalies in other physical properties of pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 near @xmath10 that correlate with the features we have observed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 has attracted an enormous amount of interest since it was discovered several years ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this compound is the first heavy fermion superconductor based on pr ( all of the others are based on ce and u ) , the superconductivity appears to be unconventional , and the pairing of superconducting electrons may be mediated by electric quadrupole fluctuations , rather than magnetic dipole fluctuations that are believed to be responsible for pairing in the other heavy fermion superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> a number of experiments have provided evidence for unconventional superconductivity in pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> structure in the jumps of both the specific heat @xcite and thermal expansion @xcite associated with the superconducting transition suggests that there may be two distinct superconducting phases with superconducting critical temperatures @xmath11 k and @xmath12 k in zero field . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting penetration depth measurements , extracted from muon spin relaxation ( @xmath13sr ) experiments in a magnetic field of @xmath14 oe @xcite , and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) measurements @xcite indicate that the superconductivity of pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 is in the strong coupling regime and has an isotropic energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , measurements of the angular ( @xmath15 ) dependence of the thermal conductivity @xmath16 in a magnetic field @xmath17 @xcite have been interpreted as evidence for two distinct superconducting phases , a low field phase with two point nodes and a high field phase with four or six point nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting penetration depth @xmath18 , measured in very low field by means of a microwave technique @xcite , is consistent with point nodes in the energy gap . </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that the unconventional superconductivity in pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 may occur in the vicinity of a quadrupolar quantum critical point ( qcp ) , similar to the situation with certain ce and u compounds where superconductivity is found in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) qcp @xcite . in this letter , we report measurements of the lower critical field @xmath0 , critical current @xmath1 , ac magnetic susceptibility @xmath23 , and specific heat @xmath24 in order to obtain more information about the unconventional superconductivity exhibited by this intriguing material . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements indicate that a transition to another superconducting phase , characterized by enhanced @xmath0 and @xmath1 , occurs deep within the superconducting state at @xmath25 k ( @xmath10 ) in zero field .    </S>",

    "<S> measurements in a magnetic field indicate that @xmath37 and @xmath39 track each other and lie on curves with similar shapes displaced from one another in the @xmath44 plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the large diamagnetic change in @xmath31 occurs at @xmath37 due to induced supercurrents , it is clear that the transition at @xmath37 is associated with superconductivity . </S>",

    "<S> we observe a pronounced enhancement of @xmath28 below @xmath2 k. similar enhancements of @xmath0 have been observed by various groups in u@xmath6th@xmath7be@xmath8 @xcite for th concentrations x between @xmath47 and @xmath48 and in upt@xmath9 @xcite below their second ( lower ) superconducting transition temperatures @xmath39 . </S>",

    "<S> was aligned parallel to the largest dimension , we have not introduced demagnetization corrections to the given values of @xmath28 . the sharp kink and enhancement of @xmath0 reported in this letter are consistent with the positive curvature in @xmath0 deduced from previous magnetization measurements on pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 @xcite , although these measurements did not have enough resolution to reveal the sharp kink in @xmath0 at @xmath2 k.     vs @xmath46 for the pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 single crystal . </S>",

    "<S> coincident with the enhancement of @xmath28 at @xmath61 k , we observe a dramatic increase in @xmath60 below the same temperature , indicating that the superconducting phase below @xmath2 k has substantially stronger pinning . by comparison with upt@xmath9 and thoriated ube@xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> one is tempted to identify the temperature @xmath61 k below which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are enhanced with a third superconducting transition at a critical temperature @xmath62 k.    one might ask whether inclusions of free os in the single crystal could be responsible for the enhancement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 below @xmath62 k , since the @xmath19 of pure os of @xmath63 k @xcite is close to the value of @xmath64 . however , it seems very unlikely that these features in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are due to free os since x - ray diffraction and electron microprobe studies do not give any indication of the presence of free os in the pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 single crystal within the limits of detectability . furthermore , although @xmath0 of pure os is @xmath65 times larger than that of pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 below @xmath64 @xcite , it would not be detected in measurements of @xmath45 shielding isotherms . in this case , the first deviation of @xmath45 from linear meissner behavior , corresponding to the first vortex penetration , would occur at the lowest @xmath28 , namely that of pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 . also , inclusions of free os would not be expected to increase the pinning of vortices , and , in turn , @xmath1 , when they become superconducting .    </S>",
    "<S> the second critical temperature @xmath39 inferred from the structure in @xmath24 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ c+chi ] ) does not seem to be associated with the critical temperature @xmath66 separating two superconducting phases , a low field phase with two point nodes in the energy gap and a high field phase with four or six point nodes in the energy gap , inferred from the @xmath16 measurements in a magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between these two superconducting phases with different order parameter symmetries has not been observed in any other physical properties to date .    </S>",
    "<S> zero field muon spin relaxation measurements reveal the spontaneous appearance of magnetic moments below @xmath37 , indicative of breaking of time reversal symmetry in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the superconducting phases below @xmath37 and @xmath39 are `` nonunitary '' spin triplet ( odd parity ) superconducting states , which have nonvanishing spin moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is that the two superconducting phases have different order parameter symmetries , as occurs in upt@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this material has two superconducting jumps in the specific heat in zero field separated by @xmath67 k. on the other hand , recent microwave surface impedance measurements on pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 down to @xmath68 k have been interpreted in terms of josephson - coupled two - band superconductivity , implying two order parameters of the same symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the superconducting phases associated with @xmath37 and @xmath39 are not well understood and that further research is needed to elucidate their nature .    other physical properties of pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 </S>",

    "<S> sb nuclear quadrupole resonance measurements @xcite reveal that the inverse nuclear spin lattice relaxation time @xmath70 does not exhibit a coherence peak near @xmath19 , decreases exponentially with decreasing temperature by over three orders of magnitude , and then abruptly levels off below @xmath2 k. the absence of a coherence peak near @xmath19 is also found in other ce and u heavy fermion superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> however , the exponential decrease in @xmath70 with decreasing @xmath30 is in marked contrast to the @xmath71 variation of @xmath70 at low temperatures generally observed in ce and u heavy fermion superconductors , as expected for line nodes in the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment also yields a large value of the energy gap @xmath72 indicative of strong coupling , consistent with the large value @xmath73 determined from specific heat measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential dependence of @xmath70 implies that the superconducting energy gap is isotropic ; interestingly , @xmath13sr measurements of the penetration depth @xmath18 in a magnetic field of 200 oe also yield evidence for an isotropic energy gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath16 data of izawa et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the @xmath74 data of chia et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite indicate that there are point nodes in the energy gap . however , the abrupt levelling off of @xmath70 at @xmath2 k following its exponential decrease suggest a transition to a superconducting phase below @xmath69 k with states in the energy gap .    the measurements of @xmath74 on a single crystal of pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 by chia et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also exhibit a feature in the vicinity of @xmath61 k. in this study , a small upturn in @xmath75 was observed at @xmath76 k in the three directions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , at which the ac field was applied . the measured drop in @xmath75 at @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> k from the high temperature values , although rather small , clearly points to an increase in the superfluid density for @xmath80 k. the @xmath74 data were then fitted by the authors from @xmath81 k to @xmath82 k with power laws of the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 , suggesting the presence of low lying excitations in this temperature range , incompatible with an isotropic superconducting gap .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct measurement of the superconducting energy gap of pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 was made using a high resolution scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) by suderow et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements on parts of the sample yielded a superconducting density of states with a well - defined energy gap and no low energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> a plot of the energy gap @xmath85 vs @xmath30 has an overall shape that is consistent with the bcs theory , but with a small feature near @xmath69 k that could be associated with the anomalies we have observed at the same temperature in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , measurements on other parts of the sample revealed spectra with a finite density of states at the fermi level in the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the superconducting phase that appears to form below @xmath3 is an inhomogeneous phase consisting of regions with a full gap and regions with states in the gap .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed an unexpected enhancement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 below @xmath10 in the new filled skutterudite heavy fermion superconductor pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 . from a comparison of the behavior of @xmath0 with that of the heavy fermion superconductors u@xmath6th@xmath7be@xmath8 and upt@xmath9 , we speculate that the enhancements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 reflect a transition into another superconducting phase at @xmath86 k. an examination of the literature revealed unexplained anomalies in other physical properties around @xmath2 k. these anomalies </S>",
    "<S> should be investigated further in light of the new observations reported in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , there is no evidence of a jump in the specific heat around @xmath2 k @xcite , even in recent more detailed measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one reason could be that the transition at @xmath64 is of first order , like the one between the a and b phases of superfluid @xmath27he , or of a higher order than second . </S>",
    "<S> a small feature in @xmath24 could also be obscured by the nuclear schottky contribution which increases rapidly with decreasing temperature at low temperatures below @xmath87 k. finally , the discrepancy between different experiments on single crystals at @xmath88 , concerning the nature of the superconducting gap , can be reconciled if the temperature interval covered in the analysis is taken into account . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the nqr anaylsis @xcite , consistent with an isotropic gap was performed for @xmath89 k , while the penetration depth analysis @xcite , consistent with nodes in the gap , was done for @xmath90 k. in view of the enhancement of @xmath28 and @xmath60 below @xmath64 reported here , it seems plausible that the nature of the gap function changes at @xmath64 . </S>"
