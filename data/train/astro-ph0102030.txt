    "the very large telescope interferometer@xcite ( vlti ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) with its four 8.2 m unit telescopes ( uts ) and three 1.8 m auxiliary telescopes ( ats ) will certainly establish a new era of optical and infrared interferometric imaging within the next few years . with a maximum baseline of up to",
    "more than 200 m , the vlti will allow the study of astrophysical key objects with unprecendented resolution opening up new vistas to a better understanding of their physics .",
    "the near - infrared focal plane instrument of the vlti , the astronomical multibeam recombiner@xcite ( amber ) , will operate between 1 and 2.5@xmath6 m and for up to three beams allowing the measurement of closure phases . in a second stage its wavelength coverage",
    "is planned to be extended to 0.6@xmath6 m .",
    "objects as faint as @xmath7mag are expected to be observable with amber when a bright reference star is available , and as faint as @xmath8mag otherwise .    among the astrophysical key issues@xcite",
    "are , for instance , young stellar objects , active galactic nuclei and stars in late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "the simulation of interferometric imaging of a stellar object consists in principle of two components : +    ( i )    the calculation of an astrophysical model of the object , typically based on radiative transfer calculations predicting , e.g. , its intensity distribution . to obtain a robust and non - ambiguous model ,",
    "it is of particular importance to take _ diverse _ observational constraints into account , for instance the spectral energy distribution and visibilities .     +    ( ii )    the determination of the interferometer s response to this intensity signal , i.e.  the simulation of light propagation in the atmosphere and the interferometer .",
    "+ often , only one of the above parts is considered in full detail .",
    "the aim of this study is to combine both efforts and to present a computer simulation of the vlti performance for observations of one object class , the dusty supergiants . for this purpose",
    ", we calculated a detailed radiative transfer model for one of its most outstanding representatives , the supergiant irc+10420 , and carried out computer simulations of vlti visibility measurements .",
    "the goal is to estimate how accurate visibilities can be measured with the vlti in this particular but not untypical case , to discuss if the accuracy is sufficient to distinguish between different theoretical model predictions and to study on what the accuracy is dependent .",
    "the star irc+10420 (= v1302  aql ) is an outstanding object for the study of stellar evolution .",
    "its spectral type changed from f8i@xmath9 in 1973@xcite to mid - a today@xcite corresponding to an increase of its effective temperature of 1000 - 2000k within only 25yr .",
    "it is heavily obscured by circumstellar dust due to strong mass loss with rates typically of the order of several @xmath10m@xmath11/yr ( m@xmath11 : solar mass ) @xcite .",
    "irc+10420 is believed to be a massive luminous star of initially @xmath12 to 40 m@xmath11 currently being observed in its rapid transition from the red supergiant stage to the wolf - rayet ddphase@xcite .",
    "wolf - rayet stars , in turn , finally evolve into a supernova explosion .",
    "irc+10420 is the _ only _ object observed until now in its transition phase to the wolf - rayet stage .",
    "several infrared speckle and coronographic observations @xcite were conducted to study the dust shell of irc+10420 .",
    "the most recent study of blcker et al .",
    "@xcite reports the first diffraction - limited 73mas ( mas : milli - arcsecond ) bispectrum speckle interferometry of irc+10420 and presents the first radiative transfer calculations that model _ both _ the spectral energy distribution _ and _ the visibility of this key object .",
    "we will briefly describe the main results and conclusions of this study which will serve as astrophysical input for the vlti computer simulations presented in the next section .",

    "[ fsedvisidens17 ] shows the sed@xcite and the reconstructed 2.11@xmath6 m visibility function@xcite of irc+10420 .",
    "the visibility 0.6 at frequencies @xmath13cycles / arcsec indicates , for instance , that the stellar contribution to the total flux is @xmath1460% and the dust shell contribution is @xmath1440% .",
    "an extensive grid of radiative transfer models was calculated for the dust shell of irc+10420 assuming spherical symmetry and considering black bodies and model atmospheres as central sources of radiation , different silicates , grain - size and density distributions , various dust temperatures at the shell s inner boundary ( determining the radius of the shell s inner boundary ) and optical depths .",
    "we refer to blcker et al .",
    "@xcite for a full description of the model grid .",
    "it turned out that the observed dust - shell properties can not be matched by single - shell models but require multiple components with different density distributions .",
    "the best model was found for a dust shell with a dust temperature of @xmath15k at its inner radius of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : stellar radius ) . at a distance of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 )",
    "the density was enhanced by a factor of @xmath20 and its slope within the shell changed from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding fits for sed and 2.11@xmath6 m visibility are shown in fig .",
    "[ fsedvisidens17 ] . the shell s model intensity distribution is shown in fig .  [ fsedvisidens17 ] and was found to be ring - like due to a limb - brightened dust - condensation zone .",
    "the ring diameter is equal to the inner diameter of the hot shell ( @xmath23mas ) , and the diameter of the central star amounts to @xmath24mas .",
    "this two - component model can be interpreted in terms of a termination of an enhanced mass - loss phase roughly 90 yr ago .",
    "the assumption that irc+10420 had passed through a superwind phase in its recent history is in line with its evolutionary status of an object in transition from the red - supergiant to the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "in the previous section , the spatial intensity profile of the dusty supergiant irc+10420 ( see fig .  [ fsedvisidens17 ] ) was derived by means of radiative transfer models and their comparison with photometric and interferometric observations .",
    "this @xmath25 m intensity profile will serve as object intensity profile in the simulation of monochromatic vlti observations .",
    "the next steps are the simulation of light propagation from the object to the detector ( through atmosphere , telescopes , and the amber wide - field mode instrument ) , simulation of photon noise and detector read - out noise , and finally data processing of the interferograms .      c    fig .",
    "[ ffluss2d ] shows a flow chart of our simulation of interferometric imaging with the vlti ( ats , or uts with adaptive optics ) and the amber camera in the wide - field mode ( i.e. without fiber optics spatial filtering ) .",
    "the total number of detectable photons @xmath26 is given by the object brightness , the wavelength and band - width , the collecting area of the telescope , the total transmission of the optics , and the quantum efficiency of the detector@xcite .",
    "since we assume that the observations are carried out with a spectral resolution of @xmath27 , the number of photons available in one spectral channel for observations in the @xmath28-band is given by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the spectral resolution of the @xmath28-band ( i.e. @xmath31 is the number of spectral channels within the @xmath28-band ; @xmath32 is the total number of @xmath28-band photons ) .",
    "the simulations described below refer to observations in one spectral channel ( see also table  [ tsimu1 ] ) .",

    "the typical size of the atmospheric turbulence cells is given by the fried parameter @xmath38 .",
    "after the simulation of the entrance pupil , the next step incorporates the tip - tilt correction of the wavefront over each subpupil , but we allow for a residual tip - tilt error @xmath39 . in the next step a typical michelson output pupil",
    "is simulated by shifting both subpupils from the entrance pupil position , with a subpupil separation equal to the baseline , to the output pupil position where both subpupils are only separated by @xmath14 one subpupil diameter ( pupil reconfiguration ) .",
    "the output pupil is chosen such that ( i ) in the optical transfer function the off - axis peaks are separated from the central peak , and ( ii ) the interferograms are sampled with the smallest number of pixels to assure the lowest influence of detector noise . the following step includes light propagation through the beam combiner lens to the focal plane .",
    "the squared modulus of the fourier transform of the complex amplitude in front of the beam combiner lens yields the intensity distribution of a michelson interferogram of a point source . in the next step",
    "the required object intensity distribution is simulated ( given here by the intensity distribution of irc+10420 ) to obtain the michelson interferogram of the object : the fourier transformation of the object intensity distribution , calculated at those spatial frequencies covered by the the simulated interferometer baseline vector , is multiplied with the off - axis peaks of the transfer function of the generated michelson interferogram@xcite .",
    "finally , poisson photon - noise and detector read - out noise is injected to the interferograms .",
    "the noise level depends , among other parameters , on the number of detectable photons , the total optical throughput of the interferometer ( vlti+amber in the wide - field mode ) and the quantum efficiency of the detector .",
    "details@xcite of the simulation parameters specific to vlti - at / amber , as optical throughput , detector read - out noise and quantum efficiency , are given in table  [ tsimu1 ] .",
    "we performed simulations of irc+10420 visibility observations in the vlti - at / amber wide - field mode and studied the influence of various observational parameters on the visibility accuracy .",
    "visibility error bars were obtained for the following observational parameters :    1 .",
    "different seeing during the observation of object and reference star ( fried parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ranging between 0.9 m and 1.2 m ) , 2 .",
    "different residual tip - tilt error ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ranging between 0.1% and 20% of the airy disk diameter ) , 3 .   different object brightness ( @xmath4=0.7mag to 10.2mag , @xmath5=0.7mag ) .",
    "all computer experiments are based on 2400 interferograms of the @xmath20 intensity profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fsedvisidens17 ] ) of irc+10420 and refer to observations in one of the @xmath31 spectral channels .",
    "the error bars correspond to the reduction of six statistically independent data sets and refer to the standard deviation @xmath40 .",
    "the dependence of the error bar on the number of data sets has been verified ( see below ) . in the computer experiments ( 1 ) and",
    "( 2 ) mentioned above , object and reference star were assumed to have the same brightness .",
    "we chose @xmath28=0.7mag ( see table  [ tsimu1 ] ) in order to minimize brightness effects .",

    "these simulations supersede the corresponding results of a first exploratory study @xcite due to improved numerics and a broader statistical basis .",
    "the first computer experiment ( different seeing conditions ) consists of the simulations a to f ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fsimulall ] ) .",
    "simulation a represents the case of typical seeing conditions ( @xmath0=0.9 m , @xmath1=0.9 m ) and an almost perfect tip - tilt correction ( residual tip - tilt error @xmath43% ) .",
    "it will serve as a reference for the following simulations .",
    "the brightness of object and reference star was chosen to be @xmath28=0.7mag .",
    "the visibility error @xmath44 amounts only to @xmath45 .",
    "the remaining statistical uncertainty due to the limited number of data sets has been checked by a test calculation taking into account twice as many statistically independent data sets , i.e. 12 data sets instead of 6 .",
    "the visibility error changed by 24% from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "however , the general dependencies of the visibility accuracy on observational parameters ( seeing , residual tip - tilt error , brightness ) are only scarcely affected .    if one considers a better seeing for _ both _ object _ and _ reference star ( a - c ) , @xmath44 decreases in almost linear proportion with increasing diameter of the atmospheric turbulence cells ( fig  [ fsimulall ] ) .",
    "however , improved but _ different _ seeing conditions ( d - f ) lead to larger visibility errors .",
    "this emphasizes that equal seeing conditions for object and reference star are more crucial than excellent seeing conditions of , e.g. , the object only in order to obtain accurate visibilities .",
    "the second set of simulations ( a , g - j ) illustrates the influence of a larger residual object tip - tilt error ( see middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fsimulall ] ) .",
    "increasing @xmath39 from 0.1% to 20% for both object and reference star increases the visibility error from 0.0067 to 0.0084 ( a , f , g ) . like in the simulations of different seeing conditions , it is essential to have the same tip - tilt error for both object and reference star in order to achieve high accuracy",
    ". differences in @xmath39 enhance the visibility error ( h , i ) .",
    "finally , in the third experiment of this series an irc+10420-like intensity distribution is assumed but much much fainter ( i.e. fainter than @xmath28=3.5mag ) objects are considered ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fsimulall ] , simulations a , k - n ) .",
    "the visibility error stays almost constant up to an @xmath28 magnitude of 7mag .",
    "if the simulated object @xmath28-magnitude is 9.2mag , the visibility error has increased by a factor of @xmath47 , i.e.  to @xmath48 , but is still acceptable although the photon number decreased to @xmath49 ( i.e.  by a factor of 2500 , see table  [ tsimu1 ] ) .",
    "[ fsimulall ] demonstrates that for even fainter objects noise becomes more and more important leading to an steep increase of the visibility error .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio can be improved ( @xmath50 ) if the visibility measurements of all @xmath33 spectral channels within the @xmath28-band are averaged .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    c +",
    "we have presented computer simulations of interferometric imaging with the vlt interferometer and the amber instrument in the wide - field mode .",
