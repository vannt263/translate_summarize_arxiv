    "<S> the electrical laws and carnot cycle of isolated horizon ( ih ) are investigated in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the ohm s law and joule s law of an isolated horizon , and find that the conceptual picture of black holes ( membrane paradigm ) can also apply to this kind of quasi - local black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the geometrical properties near a non - rotating ih , and find that under the first - order approximation of @xmath0 , there exist a killing vector and a hamiltonian conjugate to it , so this vector is a physical observer . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the energy as measured at infinity of a particle at rest outside a non - rotating ih , and use this result to construct a reversible carnot cycle with the isolated horizon as a cold reservoir , which confirms the thermodynamic nature of isolated horizon .    </S>",
